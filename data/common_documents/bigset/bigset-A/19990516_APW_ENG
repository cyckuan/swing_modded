<HEADLINE> Consumer Prices Jump Sinks Stocks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Investors were rudely reminded this past week  
that inflation is very much alive, with a trio of reports showing 
the economy is still growing -- and prices are rising -- at a strong 
clip. 
</P>
<P>
	Separate reports Friday showed a bigger-than-expected rise in  
consumer prices, strong gains in industrial output and consumers' 
continued willingness to spend. 
</P>
<P>
	They were a wake-up call to investors who have been bidding  
stock prices ever higher on the assumption that, despite the 
economy's fabulous growth, inflation was in long hibernation -- if 
not dead. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will reignite this debate about whether you can run an  
economy with 4.3 percent unemployment and no inflation,'' said 
David Blitzer, chief economist at Standard &AMP; Poor's Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors worried that Friday's data would push the Federal  
Reserve to raise interest rates at its Open Market Committee 
meeting Tuesday. Although most economists still don't believe 
central bankers will tighten credit that soon, they said the 
reports could set the stage for a tightening later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can't turn a blind eye toward this,'' said Bryan  
Piskorowski, market analyst at Prudential Securities. ``It's not 
the kind of information that one can explain away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrials skidded 205 points on the reports and  
closed down 193.87 Friday at 10,913.32, one day after rising to a 
new closing high of 11,107.19. The Dow fell 118.27 for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices crashed too, pushing the yield on the 30-year  
Treasury bond up to 5.92 percent and perilously close to an 
important 6 percent level. Higher rates often send stock prices 
lower because they raise corporate borrowing costs and jeopardize 
profits, while at the same time slowing consumer spending. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts noted that stocks often fall ahead of Fed policy  
meetings. This is especially true now, they said, because stocks 
have been trading at very high prices on the assumption that 
interest rates would remain stable. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Vitner, an economist at First Union Corp. in Charlotte,  
N.C., said the current inflation picture is ``not as bad as the 
headline numbers suggest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department reported an unexpectedly sharp 0.7 percent  
rise in consumer prices in April. Minus huge increases in energy 
costs, core prices rose a surprising 0.4 percent, the most since 
January of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	But that was only payback for years of uncommonly tame  
inflation, Vitner said. Inflation as measured by consumer prices is 
rising at a manageable 2.3 percent annual pace, ``right where the 
Fed expected it to be,'' Vitner said. And the Labor Department 
reported Thursday that wholesale prices, minus food and energy, 
climbed a tiny 0.1 percent in April. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report Friday, the Fed reported factory output  
rose 0.6 percent in April, its strongest gain since the summer of 
1998. Factories operated in April at 80.6 percent of capacity. That 
was up from a revised 80.4 percent in March, but still very low, 
Vitner said. 
</P>
<P>
	And the gains in the manufacturing sector, while they were  
strong in April, were not across the board. Steel production, for 
example, dropped nearly 2 percent, Vitner noted. ``I can't see a 
true turn in the manufacturing sector without seeing some sort of 
revival in steel production.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Friday's third report, the University of Michigan said its  
consumer sentiment index, which attempts to measure consumers' 
propensity to spend, had risen so far this month to 106.4 from 
104.6 in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Although that could stir inflation fears as well, it could also  
support stock prices, which have been rising since 1992 in large 
part because consumers keep spending and boosting corporate 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a tug-of-war going on between good news on  
profitability and bad news on interest rates,'' conceded John 
Lonski, senior economist at Moody's Investors Service. 
</P>
<P>
	The real test for the stock market, he said, is whether  
corporations can continue to convert the buoyant economic trends 
into bottom-line profits. And with earnings up between 15 and 20 
percent annually from 1994 through 1997, that's a tough act to 
follow, Lonski said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Friday's trading, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 composite fell  
29.76 to 1,337.80, down 7.20 for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite declined 54.14 to 2,527.86 Friday, adding  
24.24 for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 12.90 to 638.45 Friday, losing  
2.79 for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Stock Exchange index fell 11.58 to 788.81 Friday,  
up 1.52 for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 7.71 to 443.13  
Friday but rose 7.02 for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wilshire 5000 index, which represents the combined market  
value of all NYSE, American and Nasdaq issues, closed at $12.3 
trillion, up $100 billion from the previous week.

<P>
	PORT HURON, Mich. (AP) -- A school district where police say they  
foiled a plot by four middle school students for a mass-murder 
rampage like that at Colorado's Columbine High School tentatively 
plans to resume classes Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Port Huron Public Schools and police said they quickly  
decided to close all 21 schools Friday after discovering the plot 
by four students at Holland Woods Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
	Superintendent Bill Kimball said he has formed a committee to  
create a security plan for the district that would be detailed 
publicly Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``With over 30 years in education ... I have never been involved  
in a situation this disruptive to the educational process,'' 
Kimball said. ``There is tremendous fear on the part of the student 
body.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Justin Schnepp and Jedaiah Zinzo, both 14, were charged as  
adults with conspiracy to commit murder, and ordered held on 
$100,000 bond apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other suspects were charged as juveniles with the same  
crime. One of those boys is 13. Police said the other boy is 12, a 
prosecutor said he is 13. 
</P>
<P>
	They are expected to appear Tuesday for a probate hearing in St.  
Clair County Juvenile Court. All four remained in custody Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Police allege the suspects planned to kill people at Holland  
Woods, which has about 560 students in grades six through eight. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month in Littleton, Colo., teenage gunmen Eric Harris and  
Dylan Klebold killed 13 people at Columbine before committing 
suicide.

<HEADLINE> Jazz Fans Go Crazy at Game 5 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Karl Malone asked Utah Jazz fans to ``get  
a little crazy'' for Sunday's Game 5 against the Sacramento Kings. 
</P>
<P>
	That's like asking a shark to get a little hungry.  
</P>
<P>
	There was pandemonium in and around the Delta Center all day as  
Utah's notoriously vocal, rambunctious fans were in peak form. 
Hundreds gathered on the arena grounds hours before the game, 
competing for tickets from local radio stations and generally 
making noise. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Kings arrived at the arena, they were greeted by  
chanting fans carrying everything from cowbells to miniature police 
sirens. The Jazz complained about Arco Arena fans ringing cowbells 
and blowing whistles from the stands behind their bench in Friday's 
Game 4 win in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
	``We took it personally when the people in Sacramento were  
razzing our guys,'' said Provo contractor Danny Guise, 31, who had 
his face painted and carried a sign reading ``The Kings Must Die!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Karl and some of the guys say we really help when we're loud  
and in the other team's face, so we're just doing our job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the arena, dozens of fans were decked out in camouflage  
and bright orange clothing, and dozens of wildlife calls could be 
heard as the two teams warmed up. Malone, an avid hunter, asked the 
fans to do just that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking forward to running through that tunnel tomorrow  
and playing this game. My friends are going to have elk calls and 
duck calls and all that,'' Malone said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of signs dotted the stands, with sentiments ranging  
from ``Sacto is for whom the cowbell tolls,'' to ``You messed with 
the wrong fans. We'll make Arco Arena sound like church.'' The 
Jazz's mascot, Bear, rang a bell the size of a Thanksgiving turkey 
right behind the Kings' bench. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz unleashed pregame fireworks that incited the crowd to  
deafening noise levels. The loudest cheers came for John Stockton, 
who hit the 23-foot jumper with seven-tenths of a second to play 
that won Game 4 for the Jazz. 
</P>
<P>
	The noise added another level of excitement to an already tense  
game. Malone, Corliss Williamson and Chris Webber picked up 
technical fouls in the first 1:45, and Vlade Divac got tangled up 
with Greg Ostertag in a shoving match. 
</P>
<P>
	The noise reached deafening levels when the Kings called a  
timeout after falling behind 14-3.

<HEADLINE> Protests Over Malcolm X Diary Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The bloodied, bullet-riddled diary of Malcolm X,  
which was in his coat pocket when he was assassinated, is going up 
for auction. 
</P>
<P>
	But his family insists they are the rightful owners of the 146  
pages once used as evidence in the trial of the men convicted of 
killing the black Muslim leader. 
</P>
<P>
	``This should go back to the family,'' Kenneth Cobb, director of  
New York's Municipal Archives, said on Saturday. ``This is the 
personal property of Malcolm X.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The red, mock-leather booklet was People's Exhibit 60 at the  
trial of the three men found guilty in Malcolm X's killing on Feb. 
21, 1965, in a Harlem ballroom. 
</P>
<P>
	An auction house in San Francisco, Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield, is  
to sell the diary on May 27 for possibly as much as $50,000. Marred 
by three bullet holes and blood stains, it contains phone numbers 
of Malcolm's friends and associates, other personal notes, and his 
schedule on days he never lived to see. 
</P>
<P>
	New York City officials are now investigating how the item got  
into the hands of a private collector, who then sold it to the 
current owner, reportedly a New York resident. 
</P>
<P>
	The archives took possession of Malcolm X's case files from the  
Manhattan District Attorney's office in 1993, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The personal effects of a murder victim usually are returned to  
family members, police Inspector Michael Collins told The New York 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Fleming, who represents the estate of the late Betty  
Shabazz, Malcolm's widow, told the newspaper that the family, 
including Malcolm's daughter Ilyasah Shabazz, is ``shocked that 
something that represents so intimate a part of their father's last 
moments would find its way to an auction house on the West Coast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phone calls to Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield were not immediately  
answered Saturday, nor was a message left at Fleming's New York 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	The auction house released a one-line statement late Saturday,  
saying it ``does not believe (and have not said we believe) the 
address book of Malcom X was sold by the New York Police 
Department.'' Officials did not, however, say how the previous 
owner obtained the book.

<HEADLINE> Jefferson's Slave Kin Shunned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) -- At an emotional and at times  
rancorous meeting, descendants of Thomas and Martha Jefferson on 
Sunday refused to let relatives of his slave Sally Hemings join the 
family association. 
</P>
<P>
	The Monticello Association also blocked a vote to give the  
relatives of Jefferson's alleged mistress honorary membership while 
a paternity claim is researched. 
</P>
<P>
	Jefferson was accused publicly during his presidency in 1802 of  
being the father of several of Hemings' children after his wife 
died. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of her family have passed down the paternity claim  
through the generations. In November, a DNA study concluded that 
Jefferson was likely the father of Eston Hemings, the slave's 
youngest son. 
</P>
<P>
	Descendants on both sides who are convinced that Jefferson is  
the father of Hemings' children said Sunday's meeting, which was 
closed to the media, was productive. 
</P>
<P>
	``The nation is looking to this family for leadership in healing  
some of the wounds of slavery and segregation, and I thought today 
we took a good first step toward doing that,'' said Monticello 
Association member Marla Randolph Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
	The Monticello Association appointed a committee to do further  
research into the paternity claim and deliver a report before the 
next annual meeting. The group also allowed Hemings' descendants 
inside the hotel ballroom for the membership debate. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, three-dozen Hemings descendants were invited to the  
reunion luncheon and business meeting for the first time since the 
association formed 86 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	But before they could even finish their dessert, a Monticello  
Association member made a motion to ask the Hemings guests to leave 
the room during a discussion of ``family business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It got a little tense,'' Hemings descendant Bill Dalton of  
Chillicothe, Ohio, said afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	Hemings descendant John Taylor King said ``there were little  
angry knots of people'' in the crowd of about 250 men, women and 
children. But he said the 30-23 vote to let them stay restored his 
faith in the ``good intentions'' of the Jefferson descendants. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucian Truscott of Los Angeles, the Jefferson descendant who  
first invited the Hemingses to come, told reporters after the 
meeting that there was ``an element of racism'' in the arguments to 
deny immediate membership. 
</P>
<P>
	He and Jefferson descendant Theresa Shackelford of Nashville,  
Tenn., who wants the paternity claim to be researched further, 
argued back and forth in front of the microphone stand in the 
lobby. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm for any lineal descendant to be able to be buried at  
Monticello, black, white or purple,'' Ms. Shackelford said. ``We're 
not racists. We're snobs.''

<HEADLINE> Pollsters Face Threat From Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETE BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Pollsters who just experienced one  
of their most influential years now face a triple threat: increased 
scrutiny by critics, declining public response to poll interviewers 
and the lure of Internet surveys. 
</P>
<P>
	These were major concerns of pollsters who gathered over the  
weekend for the annual meeting of the American Association for 
Public Opinion Research. 
</P>
<P>
	The role played by public opinion in President Clinton's sex  
scandal and impeachment trial was a frequent theme at the weekend 
sessions. While public support for the president did not prevent an 
impeachment trial, many analysts believe it contributed to his 
political survival. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last year solidified the importance of public opinion,''  
said New York City pollster Warren Mitofsky. ``The public made it 
abundantly clear over and over again -- they were supporting Bill 
Clinton as president, but condemning his behavior.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton's impeachment trial raised the political stakes for  
polling, and the poll results that backed him became part of the 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Public opinion polls became ``political footballs to be kicked  
around,'' said Kathleen Frankovic, director of polling for CBS 
News. 
</P>
<P>
	The unwillingness of some people to participate in polls, a  
problem pollsters call ``non-response,'' also was discussed by 
pollsters at the conference. 
</P>
<P>
	A study by the Pew Research Center for the People &AMP; the Press  
showed no difference in low and high response polls, but pollsters 
say they do not fully understand the effects of low response. 
</P>
<P>
	The non-response problem has grown as people have more high-tech  
phone screening devices, less use for inquiries from strangers and 
the perception that they have less time, say pollsters. 
</P>
<P>
	Some estimate that response levels have dropped about 10  
percentage points over the last decade from levels that had ranged 
between 50 percent to 60 percent, depending on the definition used. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're beginning to address this problem head-on, to find out  
what difference response rates make in terms of quality,'' said 
Michael Traugott, incoming president of AAPOR. 
</P>
<P>
	A more controversial issue at this meeting was Internet polls,  
which have sprung up on many Web sites and threaten to drown out 
scientific polls. 
</P>
<P>
	Traditional pollsters said over the weekend they are considering  
a rating system to distinguish between scientifically designed 
polls, which pick a random geographic and weighted sample of the 
entire population, and those which do not. 
</P>
<P>
	The polling firm Harris Black International made a pitch to the  
group that the Internet can be used effectively for election 
polling by drawing a large pool of Web users and then finding a 
representative poll sample from that group. 
</P>
<P>
	But most in the polling field argue the company cannot draw a  
representative sample of the nation's population off the Internet, 
which is used by about 40 percent of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Murray Edelman, editorial director of Voter News Service and  
incoming AAPOR vice president, said Internet polling will never 
supplant the highest quality probability polls. But he acknowledged 
the Internet efforts are likely to ``reshape polling'' at some 
levels because of their convenience and relative low cost. 
</P>
<P>
	VNS is a partnership of the ABC, CBS, CNN, NBC and Fox  
television networks and The Associated Press that conducts state 
and national exit polls on Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
	George Terhanian, director of Internet Research at Harris Black  
acknowledges limitations of the current population using the 
Internet, but says: ``We will gladly take a few hits in order to 
get this right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite their concerns, pollsters said the last year offered a  
unique environment to practice their craft and reinforce the 
accuracy of polling. 
</P>
<P>
	Traugott, AAPOR president, said the intense focus of pollsters  
on the Clinton scandal provided quick public judgments that proved 
stable for the duration. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure we'll see soon another instance,'' Traugott said,  
``in which there was such highly focused polling activity on such a 
limited set of topics.''

<HEADLINE> Rapids 1, Fire 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Joey DiGiamarino scored in the 12th minute Sunday  
on a blast from about 20 yards out as the Colorado Rapids beat the 
Chicago Fire 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the fifth straight win for the Rapids (5-2), a team  
record, and their first shutout of the year. The Fire (5-3) lost 
for the first time in regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have liked to have seen more possessions down the  
stretch, but sometimes you just have to dig in and fight,'' 
Colorado coach Glenn Myernick said. 
</P>
<P>
	DiGiamarino took a pass from Wolde Harris and dribbled between  
two Fire defenders before freeing the ball by kicking it forward 
and to his left. He outran the defenders, caught up to the ball and 
then slammed it into the goal on a diagonal kick past a diving Zach 
Thornton. 
</P>
<P>
	It was DiGiamarino's first goal in regulation this season. He's  
converted two of his four attempts in shootouts. Ross Paule also 
was credited with an assist on the goal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fire had what looked like a can't-miss opportunity in the  
47th minute, when Roman Kosecki was fouled in the penalty box by 
Anders Limpar. Lubos Kubik, who hadn't missed a penalty kick in six 
tries, took the shot, but it banged off the left side of the 
crossbar. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the Fire's first missed penalty kick in eight tries.  
</P>
<P>
	Colorado goalkeeper Marcus Hahnemann had nine saves, including a  
key stop in the 78th minute. Chris Armas took a straight-on shot 
only to have Hahnemann block it. Armas looked like he might get a 
second shot at the ball, but Hahnemann made another save. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 87th minute, Hahnemann deflected a shot from Wolff and  
the ball bounced over the goal. 
</P>
<P>
	The game was part of a doubleheader with the U.S. women's soccer  
team, which beat the Netherlands 3-0 in a tuneup for next month's 
Women's World Cup. Mia Hamm tied the record for international goals 
with her 107th, and also had an assist on Brandi Chastain's second 
goal.

<HEADLINE> Midler Helps Save New York Garden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- On one side was the city, eager to sell 112  
vacant lots and cash in during a real estate boom. On other side 
were urban green thumbs who had turned the neglected plots from 
trash-strewn symbols of inner-city decay into lush flower beds and 
vegetable gardens. 
</P>
<P>
	In the middle was Bette Midler.  
</P>
<P>
	Activists dressed as ladybugs and sunflowers protested outside  
City Hall, without success. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani told them, 
``This isn't communism,'' suggesting they buy the land themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	The gardens brightened often bleak streets across the city, from  
the Lower East Side to the Bronx. But the city had always reserved 
the right to claim the lots for development. So, when the city's 
economic boom made the open space valuable, it put the plots on the 
auction block. 
</P>
<P>
	The gardeners -- some of whom had tended the plots for more than  
20 years -- objected loudly. 
</P>
<P>
	But it seemed no one in government was listening. Unable to get  
a meeting with the mayor, 30 staged a sit-in at City Hall in 
February. Festooned with fake flowers and plants, they printed 
songbooks and sang versions of civil rights-era songs with updated 
lyrics: ``We Shall Overcome'' became ``We Shall Till the Soil.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, a gardener dressed as a giant sunflower climbed a  
tree outside City Hall and refused to come down until the mayor 
came out. Instead, a police officer climbed the tree and arrested 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, unknown to the protesters, a coalition of  
environmental groups led by the nonprofit Trust for Public Land, 
was trying to save the gardens. 
</P>
<P>
	They resisted the idea of buying the land since the trust favors  
creating public land ownership, but there was no strong 
alternative, said Roberta Greene, spokeswoman for the New York 
Restoration Project, a group founded four years ago by Midler. 
</P>
<P>
	``When all the other efforts didn't seem to be going anywhere,''  
according to Greene, ``Midler said, 'Well, if worst comes to worst, 
we'll just buy them.''' 
</P>
<P>
	As negotiations proceeded without reaching a deal, the  
singer-actress stepped in Wednesday -- the morning before the 
auction -- and offered $250,000 of her own money and $1 million from 
her group to buy 51 gardens. 
</P>
<P>
	The Trust would pay $3 million -- including an additional $1  
million from Midler's group -- for the 61 others. 
</P>
<P>
	The $4.2 million total exceeded the $3.5 million the city hoped  
to get at auction. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're thrilled. This is a joyous occasion and means that these  
gardens will stay in perpetuity,'' Midler said in a statement. 
``I'm grateful to everyone who has helped us save these important 
neighborhood gardens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some protesting gardeners objected to being left out of the  
negotiating process. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are dismayed that the gardeners have been excluded,'' said  
Emerson Running Sky, one of 90 gardeners arrested in protests. 
``Such wrangling, even for noble reasons, does injury to our 
democracy and does little to empower the affected communities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The secrecy was essential, though, to reach a deal with city  
negotiators, said Susan Clark of the Trust for Public Land. 
</P>
<P>
	``People might be upset right now,'' Clark said. ``But their  
long-term reaction will be happiness, because the gardens got 
saved.''

<HEADLINE> 'Star Wars' More About Storytelling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Marc Norman, the Academy Award-winning  
co-writer of ``Shakespeare in Love,'' recalls the day 22 years ago 
when his children went to see a new movie about battles in space. 
</P>
<P>
	``They dragged me back to the 2 o'clock show,'' Norman says.  
``It had gods, devils and Bible stories. I experienced what 
somebody might, in the face of a new religion -- I was scared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	People don't talk about ``Star Wars.'' They bow before it, in  
fear or in awe. Or they turn away, in disappointment or 
disinterest. Few refuse to acknowledge it. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1977, George Lucas did more than make history. ``Star Wars''  
went on to become the second-highest grossing movie of all time, 
behind only ``Titanic,'' and its two sequels would rank seventh and 
ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucas would also create a history, a modern mythology, populated  
by space adventurers called Luke and Han, a princess named Leia, 
the Wookiee co-pilot Chewbacca and droid sidekicks R2-D2 and C-3PO. 
His mythology influenced a generation in Hollywood and two 
generations of fans. It also became intertwined with his personal 
myth: reclusive filmmaker, Hollywood outsider, control freak. 
</P>
<P>
	The mythologies always threatened to swallow him, betray him,  
even today, as the world readies itself for a new religious 
experience with Wednesday's release of the prequel, ``Star Wars: 
Episode I -- The Phantom Menace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He urges restraint.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's only a movie. People should get a life,'' Lucas told a  
New York news conference this month. 
</P>
<P>
	``People should have a well-rounded life,'' he added. ``(The  
movies) are designed to make people think about the larger entities 
and the mysteries of life and hopefully raise questions. There 
definitely aren't enough answers in 'Star Wars' to constitute a 
religion. The point is to go and look through the religions and 
find something that has some answers for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Good and bad. Light and dark. A hero embarks on a journey of  
self-discovery. It doesn't get much more basic than that. Lucas's 
original ``Star Wars'' movie drew its Force from age-old tales. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing he's very good at, and I completely believe it's  
instinctual to him and not designed, is his ability to just lock 
onto the basic themes that people enjoy,'' says Dale Pollock, who 
wrote ``Skywalking: The Life and Films of George Lucas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pollock writes in a new chapter, added for an edition timed for  
release with ``The Phantom Menace,'' that while Lucas has 
``reinvented the entire process of movie making'' with computer 
technology, ``the point is not the technology, but the 
storytelling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, the technology didn't hurt. People of one generation  
remember where they were and what they were feeling the day 
President Kennedy was shot. People of another remember that first 
time they saw the space ship glide across the screen in the 
beginning of ``Star Wars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added to this was the soaring score by John Williams, music that  
``was definitely the turning point in my life,'' says ``Matrix'' 
composer, Don Davis, who recalls seeing the original ``Star Wars'' 
for this first time when he was studying music at UCLA. ``It gave 
everyone something to strive before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Movies just never looked like that before, never sounded like  
that before, never transported people to another time and place so 
completely. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think of the look of it, the feel of it, the emotion of it.  
You really got caught up in it,'' producer-screenwriter Dean Devlin 
says. ``I remember, I was 13 years old, at the Chinese Theater, 
opening day, and the whole audience started hissing when Darth 
Vader came on. I had never hissed a character in a movie in my 
life. But you knew this is the baddest guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Devlin, who himself grew up to create special effects-filled  
``popcorn movies'' like ``Godzilla'' and ``Independence Day,'' 
stresses that the allure of ``Star Wars'' was foremost in the 
storytelling, the mythological elements. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what will make or break this new one,'' he says.  
</P>
<P>
	And it is on this score that the early critics (many are holding  
their reviews until the release date) have been most unkind about 
``The Phantom Menace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A brilliant technology achievement ... but a less emotionally  
resonant exercise,'' said Variety. ``He doesn't seem to care about 
building a character,'' said Newsweek. ``Needed more human and less 
digital scale,'' said the New York Daily News. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucas saw them coming. At the news conference, before the  
notices started rolling in, he said his ``Star Wars'' films have 
``mostly been trashed one way or another'' and ``I certainly expect 
not to do well critically.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But there was more to his preemptive reply. It spoke to the  
power of myth -- to transport, and to suffocate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the fans have unfortunately got themselves into a  
situation both from the fact they've gotten much older and that the 
film is really for young people,'' he said. ``They have these 
amazing expectations that the film can't possibly live up to.''

<HEADLINE> Winter Olympics Mascots Unveiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A snowshoe hare, a coyote and a bear -- all  
characters in western Indian myth -- will be the mascots for the 
next Winter Olympics, 1,000 days from now. 
</P>
<P>
	The cuddly mascots were introduced Saturday night to more than  
15,000 onlookers, many wearing parkas to fend off the unseasonably 
chilly, 47-degree weather. The crowd cheered wildly as man-sized 
models of the critters were unveiled on stage. 
</P>
<P>
	An 18-foot arrowhead-shaped clock to count down the days also  
was unveiled in a long-awaited celebration in this city rocked by 
Olympic scandal. The mascots were scheduled to debut in February, 
but revelations over the excessive wooing of International Olympic 
Committee members by Salt Lake bidders earlier this decade stalled 
the festivities. 
</P>
<P>
	But memories of the scandal didn't keep away the crowds.  
</P>
<P>
	Barbara Butler, a retired schoolteacher, admitted her enthusiasm  
for the games has been dampened by the bribery revelations, but 
said she didn't want to miss a chance to be part of the first good 
news for Utah's Olympics for quite some time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great organization that has been blighted,'' Butler  
said. ``We can get it on the right track again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moments before the unveiling, Indian storyteller Billy Daydodge,  
encircled by dancing children and lighting that brought to mind a 
desert campfire, explained the three mascots' place in American 
Indian myth. Each mascot wears a charm around its neck fashioned 
after the ancient rock drawings of two Utah tribes. 
</P>
<P>
	When the lights came on, revealing a snowy mountain backdrop,  
some of the children on stage threw themselves into the arms of the 
giant creatures for hugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Tammy Gergen, who came from Boise, Idaho for the ceremony with  
her children Rhandi, 17, and Autumn, 14, said it seemed the smaller 
children liked the bear best. 
</P>
<P>
	``He looks like he's ready to hug them, with his arms wide  
open,'' Gergen said. But her teens said they preferred the coyote 
and the hare because, ``they're cute.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adults liked the mascots too, which look more like cartoon  
animals than the far-out design for Izzy, the mascot of the Atlanta 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice to have something real instead of looking like  
strange creatures,'' said Gerri Camden, who came with her husband 
Rob and 3-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Rob Camden was disappointed  
</P>
<P>
	``I was looking for the Jello man,'' he said, poking fun at Utah  
residents' reputation as the country's greatest consumers of Jello. 
In fact, an Olympic pin modeled on green Jello sold out within days 
of its introduction. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the lack of Jello, spectators lined up by the hundreds  
at booths to buy hats, pins and T-shirts bearing the mascots' 
images. 
</P>
<P>
	That was good news for the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, which  
will depend on the critters to bring in a good share of $40 million 
to $50 million in merchandise sales. 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC president Mitt Romney thanked the crowd for showing up --  
and for pitching in their dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're buying things, that helps too,'' Romney said. ``We've  
had a bit of a drought. People were a little nervous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Choosing three mascots instead of one trebles the marketing  
opportunities, an approach favored by recent Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney said the hare, coyote and bear represent the land and  
culture of Utah and the American West and the Olympics' Latin motto 
of Citius, Altius, Fortius -- or swifter, higher, stronger. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their stories are a wonderful translation of a Native American  
legend into the symbolism of the Olympic movement,'' he said. ``The 
theme of swifter, higher, stronger crosses the boundaries of 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The organizing committee made its choice of mascots 1 1/2 years ago  
after consulting five American Indians, including experts in 
ancient rock art, as well as focus groups in Phoenix, Milwaukee and 
Salt Lake. The IOC approved the mascots last December. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah schoolchildren will begin voting on names for the mascots  
on Monday, and a national mascot-naming contest is planned this 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The first known Olympic mascot was Smoky, a dog who likely  
wandered into the Olympic Village at the Los Angeles Games in 1932. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was not until 1968 that organizers began using characters  
to market the Olympics. The 1968 Winter Games in Grenoble, France, 
used Schuss, a bubble-headed creature on skis, and the 1972 Games 
in Munich used Waldi the dachshund. 
</P>
<P>
	The last Winter Olympics in the United States, at Lake Placid in  
1980, used Roni the raccoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Calgary was the first to have multiple mascots -- Hidy and Howdy  
in 1988. Nagano, Japan, had the Snowlets, four cartoon owls, last 
year, and Sydney's 2002 Summer Games have Oly the kookaburra, 
Millie the echidna and Syd the platypus. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday is actually 1,000 days before the games, but in this city  
conscious of setting aside that day for rest, worship and family, 
the celebration was planned the night before, ending at 11:30 p.m.

<HEADLINE> 'NewsRadio' Star Arrested for Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``NewsRadio'' actor Andy Dick made news  
himself by getting arrested for drugs after crashing his car into a 
utility pole and trying to run away. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick, 33, who plays a bespectacled neurotic whiny reporter on  
the NBC sitcom, was released on $10,000 bond after his arrest 
Saturday, said police Officer Don Cox. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick hit the utility pole in Hollywood and then fled on foot  
about 11 a.m., Cox said. A witness chased him and detained him 
until police arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers found narcotics in Dick's car, Cox said. The actor was  
scheduled to appear in court on May 25. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> NASA Prepares To Repair Telescope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Anxiety is high as NASA prepares for  
a rush repair job on its beloved Hubble Space Telescope. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubble's pointing system could die any day, halting all  
astronomical observations. So NASA is sending astronauts to the 
rescue in October, eight months earlier than they were supposed to 
go. 
</P>
<P>
	The spacewalkers will not only install new gyroscopes for  
precision pointing, they will replace Hubble's brain -- its main 
computer -- and patch Hubble's peeling skin. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's got this added drama to it,'' says Steven Smith, a  
veteran Hubble repairman who will lead the spacewalking team. 
``Anytime you're working toward a goal and it becomes more urgent, 
it's a little bit more exciting. 
</P>
<P>
	``But on the down side, something's wrong with this national  
asset. That's bad, and there are thousands of people in the United 
States who are going to have to work a lot harder than they were 
going to have to originally work in the next five months to get us 
ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NASA has never put together a shuttle mission so fast.  
</P>
<P>
	Smith and the three other astronauts assigned as spacewalkers  
have been training since August. But the flight crew was not chosen 
until March, a few days after NASA decided to split the originally 
scheduled June 2000 repair mission into two. 
</P>
<P>
	The first thing newly appointed commander Curtis Brown Jr. told  
his crew was: ``Grab ahold of something, because here we go! We 
only have 28 weeks to launch and we have all the training to get 
done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown is confident they'll be ready for an Oct. 14 liftoff  
aboard space shuttle Discovery. Three and possibly four spacewalks 
are planned for the nine-day mission. 
</P>
<P>
	``Out of seven people on board, we have 18 shuttle flights. We  
have a lot of experience on board,'' says Brown, an Air Force 
officer who will be making a record-tying sixth shuttle flight. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA managers as well as astronomers around the world are  
keeping their fingers crossed that the $2 billion telescope will 
keep operating until Brown and his crew get there. The mission 
cannot be pushed up any earlier, even if something else breaks. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's an edge (of tension), but we haven't shortcut anything  
so far,'' says John Campbell, NASA's associate director for the 
Hubble Space Telescope. ``That's why I'm unwilling to move it any 
earlier. Then I feel we'd have to start shortcutting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is with Hubble's gyroscopes, needed to aim the  
telescope and hold it steady as it scrutinizes the universe. Three 
of the six have failed because of corroded wires. One more failure 
and astronomical observations will cease, although the telescope 
itself will be safe in orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you believe the statisticians -- and I don't -- they say  
there's a 70 percent chance we'll make it to October,'' says Ed 
Weiler, head of NASA's space science program. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why Weiler and other scientists consider this an  
emergency mission. 
</P>
<P>
	Commander Brown bristles, however, at that description.  
</P>
<P>
	``Let me start my crusade right now,'' he tells an interviewer.  
``This is not an emergency mission, OK? This is a science mission 
and a repair mission and it's not an emergency mission. 
</P>
<P>
	``If another gyro fails right now as we speak, Hubble would go  
into a safe mode and the Hubble Telescope would be perfectly fine 
until we got up there. It's not going to hurt itself or anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For now, the three working gyroscopes show no signs of  
degradation. (Two are originals, launched with the telescope back 
in 1990.) But the wire corrosion that knocked out the three other 
gyroscopes seems to occur at random with little, if any, advance 
warning. 
</P>
<P>
	All six gyroscopes will be replaced with improved units during  
the upcoming mission. (They come two to a pack.) Smith and his 
spacewalking partners also will install a new computer, radio 
transmitter, guidance sensor and data recorder, and fix some of the 
tattered thermal insulation. 
</P>
<P>
	Weiler says it will be difficult work, though not nearly as  
demanding or stressful as it was when astronauts had to correct 
Hubble's blurred vision during the first repair mission in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	This will be repair mission No. 3.  
</P>
<P>
	Replacing the gyroscopes will be tricky because the chamber in  
which they're housed is cramped and holds extremely fragile 
instruments. Replacing the computer will be even trickier because 
of seven cables that the spacewalkers must connect with their 
gloved hands; each connector has 20 to 40 tiny pins. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are so many little things, that if we do wrong, can  
really damage the telescope,'' says Smith, who flew on the last 
Hubble repair mission in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The most formidable work -- installing new solar panels, an  
advanced camera and a cooling unit for an idle infrared camera -- 
won't be tackled until 2001. All that had been crammed, along with 
everything else, into the original June 2000 mission. A record six 
spacewalks were planned. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would have really driven us really hard'' to accomplish  
everything in a single mission, Smith says. ``So in some ways, 
there's a blessing with a silver lining here that we're actually 
going to have two flights go to Hubble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Splitting one repair mission into two will cost NASA an extra  
$125 million or so, Weiler says. But he's quick to point out it's 
money well spent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The scientific community is enamored with Hubble,'' Weiler  
says. ``I mean, we have enormous rejection ratios. That is, four or 
five proposals out of every six are rejected. So it's greatly 
oversubscribed. Any loss in scientific productivity, you're not 
earning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among Hubble's more recent discoveries: a galaxy 13 billion  
light-years away that's the most distant object ever detected, and 
dust rings around two remote stars that may have been 
gravitationally sculpted by planets. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA hopes to keep Hubble working until 2010. The last repair  
mission is slated for 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hubble has a limited lifetime. I mean, it's not going to be up  
there forever,'' Brown says. ``So every day, every month that it's 
not operating is a day of lost science that we could have.''

<HEADLINE> US Investment Firms Can't Woo Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- As American securities firms looked for new  
opportunities overseas, moving into Japan seemed like a no-brainer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese have one of the highest savings rates in the  
industrialized world, an aging population worried about building a 
nest egg and notoriously low interest rates on bank savings 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, nearly a year after beginning an aggressive  
expansion campaign here, Merrill Lynch, Fidelity Investments and 
other titans of Wall Street have yet to prove their worth to 
ordinary Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem: this country's compulsively conservative individual  
investor. 
</P>
<P>
	Statistics compiled by Japan's Investment Trusts Association  
show foreign firms are making inroads, but remain minor players in 
the country's mutual fund market. 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch's new brokerage business, for example, expects to  
post a net loss of nearly $75 million in the last business year, 
which ended March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	And the amount of Japanese mutual fund money being managed by  
Morgan Stanley has actually dropped slightly in the past six 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's definitely going to take some time,'' said Donna Morris,  
senior vice president of the year-old Fidelity Brokerage Services 
Japan. ``The concept of `buy-and-hold' investing in Japan is very 
new.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Simply investing in stocks, in fact, is still seen by many here  
as akin to spending a day at the race track. 
</P>
<P>
	But many see that as likely to change.  
</P>
<P>
	Japan, experts note, is increasingly feeling pressures from a  
pension crisis, the rapidly aging society and diminished job 
security as the economy retrenches under the weight of a severe 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoping to capitalize on the situation, several leading Wall  
Street companies set up shop or signed alliances with domestic 
banks and brokers to win over Japan's small-potato investor -- whose 
13 percent average household savings rate is second only to France 
in the industrialized world. 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch opened its Japanese retail brokerage last year and  
is running full-page newspaper advertisements with the 
English-language headline ``Bullish on Japan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's easy to see the potential here.  
</P>
<P>
	Industry experts say less than 3 percent of Japan's estimated $9  
trillion in personal assets are in mutual fund-type investments. 
More than 50 percent of the total is locked up in multi-year 
certificates of deposit (CDs) at banks with annual yields of around 
0.25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, that loyalty to savings accounts betrays a pervasive fear  
of the risk-taking involved with stock investments. 
</P>
<P>
	While Americans have grown accustomed to fat returns, the  
collapse of Japan's once high-flying stock market at the outset of 
this decade soured many here on shareholding. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark stock index stands today at less than half its  
peak value in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stocks are too much of a gamble for most people,'' said Koichi  
Yoneda, a 22-year-old who recently graduated from college. ``The 
Japanese way is low-risk, low-return.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, a rally on Tokyo's stock markets in the first few months  
of this year shows signs that at least some investors are taking a 
second look. 
</P>
<P>
	The value of share purchases by individuals in the first week of  
April exceeded purchases by corporate and foreign investors for the 
first time in almost three years. 
</P>
<P>
	And while the average Japanese may now still be skittish when it  
comes to personal finance, they may have to start making some hard 
choices soon. 
</P>
<P>
	The government is expected to unveil a new pension scheme by  
next year resembling the 401(k) plan in the United States, which 25 
million Americans have used to invest $1 trillion in tax-deferred 
income. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo's plan will likely involve a shift from corporate-managed  
funds to investments selected by individual employees in personal 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	The increased freedom means greater risk because companies would  
no longer subsidize investments which perform poorly as they 
typically do now. 
</P>
<P>
	Pensions are also a problem.  
</P>
<P>
	PriceWaterhouseCoopers, the accounting firm, has estimated that  
underfunded pension obligations at companies in Japan may total 
more than $671 billion. Some small firms have simply pulled the 
plug on their pension plans because of massive funding shortfalls. 
</P>
<P>
	The full extent of the problem is unknown because companies here  
aren't required to disclose the information. But that will change 
next year, when new accounting rules go into effect. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's mandatory national pension plan, which is similar to the  
U.S. Social Security system, is also in trouble due to longer life 
spans and fewer births. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet for all the pessimism about Japan's financial future, some  
of the country's famously thrifty savers may find it hard to play 
the market with their hard-earned yen. 
</P>
<P>
	``People remain very afraid with regard to the preservation of  
their capital,'' said Ken Okamura, a strategist at Dresdner 
Kleinwort Benson (Asia) Ltd.

<HEADLINE>  Winter Olympics Mascots Unveiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A snowshoe hare, a coyote and a bear -- all  
characters in western Indian myth -- will be the mascots for the 
next Winter Olympics, 1,000 days from now. 
</P>
<P>
	The cuddly mascots were introduced Saturday night to more than  
15,000 onlookers, many wearing parkas to fend off the unseasonably 
chilly, 47-degree weather. The crowd cheered wildly as man-sized 
models of the critters were unveiled on stage. 
</P>
<P>
	An 18-foot arrowhead-shaped clock to count down the days also  
was unveiled in a long-awaited celebration in this city rocked by 
Olympic scandal. The mascots were scheduled to debut in February, 
but revelations over the excessive wooing of International Olympic 
Committee members by Salt Lake bidders earlier this decade stalled 
the festivities. 
</P>
<P>
	But memories of the scandal didn't keep away the crowds.  
</P>
<P>
	Barbara Butler, a retired schoolteacher, admitted her enthusiasm  
for the games has been dampened by the bribery revelations, but 
said she didn't want to miss a chance to be part of the first good 
news for Utah's Olympics for quite some time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great organization that has been blighted,'' Butler  
said. ``We can get it on the right track again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moments before the unveiling, Indian storyteller Billy Daydodge,  
encircled by dancing children and lighting that brought to mind a 
desert campfire, explained the three mascots' place in American 
Indian myth. Each mascot wears a charm around its neck fashioned 
after the ancient rock drawings of two Utah tribes. 
</P>
<P>
	When the lights came on, revealing a snowy mountain backdrop,  
some of the children on stage threw themselves into the arms of the 
giant creatures for hugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Tammy Gergen, who came from Boise, Idaho for the ceremony with  
her children Rhandi, 17, and Autumn, 14, said it seemed the smaller 
children liked the bear best. 
</P>
<P>
	``He looks like he's ready to hug them, with his arms wide  
open,'' Gergen said. But her teens said they preferred the coyote 
and the hare because, ``they're cute.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adults liked the mascots too, which look more like cartoon  
animals than the far-out design for Izzy, the mascot of the Atlanta 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice to have something real instead of looking like  
strange creatures,'' said Gerri Camden, who came with her husband 
Rob and 3-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Rob Camden was disappointed  
</P>
<P>
	``I was looking for the Jello man,'' he said, poking fun at Utah  
residents' reputation as the country's greatest consumers of Jello. 
In fact, an Olympic pin modeled on green Jello sold out within days 
of its introduction. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the lack of Jello, spectators lined up by the hundreds  
at booths to buy hats, pins and T-shirts bearing the mascots' 
images. 
</P>
<P>
	That was good news for the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, which  
will depend on the critters to bring in a good share of $40 million 
to $50 million in merchandise sales. 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC president Mitt Romney thanked the crowd for showing up --  
and for pitching in their dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're buying things, that helps too,'' Romney said. ``We've  
had a bit of a drought. People were a little nervous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Choosing three mascots instead of one trebles the marketing  
opportunities, an approach favored by recent Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney said the hare, coyote and bear represent the land and  
culture of Utah and the American West and the Olympics' Latin motto 
of Citius, Altius, Fortius -- or swifter, higher, stronger. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their stories are a wonderful translation of a Native American  
legend into the symbolism of the Olympic movement,'' he said. ``The 
theme of swifter, higher, stronger crosses the boundaries of 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The organizing committee made its choice of mascots 1 1/2 years ago  
after consulting five American Indians, including experts in 
ancient rock art, as well as focus groups in Phoenix, Milwaukee and 
Salt Lake. The IOC approved the mascots last December. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah schoolchildren will begin voting on names for the mascots  
on Monday, and a national mascot-naming contest is planned this 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The first known Olympic mascot was Smoky, a dog who likely  
wandered into the Olympic Village at the Los Angeles Games in 1932. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was not until 1968 that organizers began using characters  
to market the Olympics. The 1968 Winter Games in Grenoble, France, 
used Schuss, a bubble-headed creature on skis, and the 1972 Games 
in Munich used Waldi the dachshund. 
</P>
<P>
	The last Winter Olympics in the United States, at Lake Placid in  
1980, used Roni the raccoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Calgary was the first to have multiple mascots -- Hidy and Howdy  
in 1988. Nagano, Japan, had the Snowlets, four cartoon owls, last 
year, and Sydney's 2002 Summer Games have Oly the kookaburra, 
Millie the echidna and Syd the platypus. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday is actually 1,000 days before the games, but in this city  
conscious of setting aside that day for rest, worship and family, 
the celebration was planned the night before, ending at 11:30 p.m.

<HEADLINE> Manchester United Wins Premier Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Manchester United, behind substitute Andy Cole's  
goal in the 47th minute, won its fifth Premier League title in 
seven seasons with a 2-1 victory Sunday over Tottenham. 
</P>
<P>
	United faces Newcastle on Saturday in the F.A. Cup final at  
Wembley and then goes against Bayern Munich in Barcelona, Spain, 
May 26 for the European Champions Cup, the continent's most 
important club prize and one United has won only once -- in 1968. No 
English club has won all three in one season. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champion Arsenal, which trailed by a point entering  
the final day of play, needed for Manchester United to lose or tie 
to have any chance. 
</P>
<P>
	Arsenal did its part, defeating Aston Villa 1-0, with Nwankwo  
Kanu scoring in a goalmouth scramble in the 66th minute at home. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gunners ended the season with 78 points -- the same as last  
season when they won the league and cup double -- to 79 for 
Manchester United. 
</P>
<P>
	Cole's winning goal came before a sellout crowd of 55,000 at  
Manchester's Old Trafford. He took a long arching pass off the 
right wing from Gary Neville, touched it twice after taking the 
ball on the fly over his shoulder, then lobbed it over the head of 
Tottenham goalkeeper Ian Walker from 10 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson's five titles equal the mark of Matt Busby. Busby was  
also the last United coach to win the European Champions Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always wanted one day to win the championship at Old  
Trafford and we've done it,'' Ferguson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Danish goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel, who is leaving United to  
play next season in another European league where the schedule is 
easier, said his team would be ready for the F.A. Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been in a situation where we had an F.A. Cup final the  
Sunday after we didn't win the league, and we went to the F.A. Cup 
final feeling down,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This time around we won the league and you go into the F.A.  
Cup final with a completely different mental attitude.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the battle at the bottom of the league for the final  
relegation spot of three, Southampton stayed up with a 2-0 home win 
over Everton. Charlton was demoted -- joining Blackburn and 
Nottingham Forest -- after a 1-0 home loss to Sheffield Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> China Director: Clinton Image Hurt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANNES, France (AP) -- Chinese director Chen Kaige says President  
Clinton's image in China has been ruined by NATO's bombing of the 
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Chen, whose ``Farewell My Concubine'' shared top prize at the  
Cannes festival in 1993, is in town with his sweeping historical 
epic ``The Emperor and the Assassin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he came to the festival ``with sadness and love'' after  
seeing his country's angry reaction to the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, he said, had won many admirers in China with his recent  
visit. ``People really fell in love with him,'' Chen said Sunday. 
``But now, his image is ruined.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three journalists were killed in the May 8 bombing.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	An unseasonal invasion of jellyfish is keeping the usual Cannes  
topless bathing beauties from cooling off in the Mediterranean this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Marine Observatory in nearby Villefranche noted the unusual  
plague earlier this week, but offered no explanation. The pink, 
almost transparent creatures -- sometimes a foot or more long -- 
inflict a painful, electric sting, leaving welts and burn marks. 
Many hope better weather and stronger currents will wash them away. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	A Concorde supersonic jet was seen parked at the Nice airport  
Sunday, one of three on special shuttle duty ferrying well-heeled 
passengers to Paris and London from the Monaco Formula 1 Grand 
Prix. 
</P>
<P>
	The race, coinciding with the end of a four-day holiday weekend  
-- and of course the Cannes festival -- made Sunday one of the 
busiest days of the year: Almost 1,500 flights were expected in and 
out of Nice along with 100 helicopters from Monaco or Cannes. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Air France, the official carrier of the Cannes Film Festival, is  
pitching its 13 weekly nonstop flights from Paris to Los Angeles 
directly to Hollywood's movers and shakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, she'll make you comfortable,'' says the caption under the  
picture of a beautiful, smiling stewardess. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, she won't try to sell you a screenplay.''  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The party season is in full force at Cannes. Some of the most  
high-profile bashes already have taken place. 
</P>
<P>
	At the annual MTV party, 1,000 guests -- mostly on the very young  
side -- danced to a DJ at Carlton Beach, providing a sleepless night 
for those staying across the street at the Carlton Hotel. Among 
those in attendance: rocker Jon Bon Jovi and actor Matthew 
McConaughey. 
</P>
<P>
	More star power was evident at the much more sedate daytime Cure  
by the Shore event, hosted by Lily Tartikoff, wife of the late 
entertainment executive Brandon Tartikoff. Peri Gilpin of TV's 
``Frasier'' was a co-host, and the fete attracted Darryl Hannah and 
Jeff Goldblum. 
</P>
<P>
	While a calypso band played, guests munched on sushi and  
barbecue, and little chocolate shells filled with rice pudding. 
</P>
<P>
	The hottest ticket, though, was probably the party Saturday  
night for the new ``Austin Powers'' movie. But guests at the Palm 
Beach nightclub were largely disappointed. The food was gone by 1 
a.m., and the stars -- including Mike Myers and Val Kilmer -- were 
cordoned off in a private area.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Will Keep Taking IMF Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai said he  
does not know whether Thailand is in a position to stop drawing on 
the International Monetary Fund's $17.2 billion economic rescue 
package, The Nation newspaper reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Chuan was responding to a comment by a top finance ministry  
official on Friday that Thailand might not have to withdraw the 
remaining funds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have not been informed of the matter by the finance  
ministry,'' Chuan was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Ministry permanent secretary Suppachai Pisitvanich said  
Friday that IMF officials told him that the Thai government has 
progressed in efforts to revive the economy and can soon graduate 
from the program. 
</P>
<P>
	Thailand accepted the IMF rescue program in August 1997, one  
month after the government abandoned its fixed foreign exchange 
system, triggering financial turmoil in the region.

<HEADLINE> Some Schools May Start Class Later </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CROSS RIVER, N.Y. (AP) -- It's 9:10 a.m., and John Thurston, 18,  
is tablehopping in the cafeteria at northern Westchester County's 
John Jay High School, passing around a Tupperware container filled 
with spicy Buffalo chicken wings. 
</P>
<P>
	Lunchtime comes joltingly early for many of the 970 students at  
John Jay, who get up at 5:30 a.m., drag themselves onto school 
buses at 6:30 and are studying chemistry or calculus by 7:15. 
</P>
<P>
	Some sleep experts -- backed by parents' observations of what it  
takes to get a teen-ager out of bed -- say that sort of schedule 
runs counter to adolescents' natural body rhythms and dims their 
performance in school, at work and even behind the wheel. 
</P>
<P>
	Edge-of-dawn school starts exist elsewhere around the country,  
but districts increasingly have been moving away from them. On 
Tuesday voters in the Katonah-Lewisboro district get the chance to 
do the same. 
</P>
<P>
	It won't be cheap. The district was forced to sell some of its  
school buses in 1991 when state aid was cut suddenly, so each 
remaining bus has to make three trips every morning instead of two. 
That compelled staggered starting times: 7:15 a.m. for high school, 
9:10 for middle school and 8:15 or 8:20 for four elementary 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
	It will cost $1.33 million to buy the 14 buses needed to allow  
the high school and middle school to start at 7:55 a.m. and the 
elementary schools to start at 9. An average household will be 
assessed an extra $132 a year in taxes for six years. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the school ballot proposition say a new schedule  
would: 
</P>
<P>
	--Be better for high schoolers' health.  
</P>
<P>
	--Avoid having kids at roadside bus stops in the dark.  
</P>
<P>
	--Allow teachers at the high school and middle school to more  
easily discuss courses and student transitions. 
</P>
<P>
	--Bring middle-schoolers home in time to care for grade-school  
siblings. 
</P>
<P>
	Health has received the most attention. Some sleep experts say  
teens would perform best if high school started closer to 10. Mary 
Carskadon of Brown University has found that most adolescents need 
more than nine hours of sleep for optimal alertness but their body 
clocks keep them from going to bed early enough to get that much 
before the alarm rings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their brains are still on their pillows,'' she says.  
</P>
<P>
	A survey reported in the Journal of the American Medical  
Association also found that students' grades reflect the amount of 
sleep they get. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we are seeing is sleepy children, tired children at the  
end of the day, and it's having an effect, we believe, on their 
health and their performance,'' says Cheryl Schwartz, president of 
the Katonah-Lewisboro school board. ``The teen-agers are just being 
asked to start functioning on an intellectual level at too early a 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As 16-year-old Courtney Dwyer says on her lunch break, ``My next  
class is a double period in math. I guarantee I'll be asleep.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But proposition opponents say the schools are already  
high-achieving and there's no reason to shift schedules. An 
analysis of recent test scores puts John Jay in the top rank of 
area high schools. It sends 94 percent of its seniors to college. 
</P>
<P>
	Delaying the start of classes ``would be that much more  
civilized,'' acknowledges Superintendent Karen McCarthy. ``On the 
other hand, I certainly can understand people who say, `Karen, I 
just can't afford it.''' 
</P>
<P>
	In Kirkland, Wash., where the start time at Lake Washington High  
School was changed from 7:30 to 8 a.m. four years ago, Principal 
Paul Gentle says, ``If I could, I'd make it 9 o'clock -- and someday 
my goal is to get it there. In my judgment, it's ludicrous to send 
kids to school at 7:15.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He says first-period attendance is much better and ``teachers  
tell me much more gets done because the kids are awake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Minnesota, where the state medical association urges high  
schools to open no earlier than 8 a.m., Edina High School shifted 
its 7:25 start to 8:30 in 1996, and Minneapolis schools went from 
7:15 to 8:40 this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Surprisingly, most of the John Jay students interviewed about  
the proposition oppose it -- because they like the 1:52 p.m. 
dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got more time to hang out with friends,'' says Chris  
Caruso, 17. ``I'd much rather have extra time in the daylight than 
on a freezing morning in the winter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Early is good,'' says Elizabeth Wright, an 18-year-old senior.  
``I can work after school and it means you have enough time.'' She 
admits, however, ``If I go to a 9 o'clock movie on Friday night, I 
fall asleep at 10.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Administrators say more and more students are being driven to  
school to save 15 or 20 minutes of bus time. One recent morning, a 
steady stream of cars drops students at the front door while, in 
the back, the buses drop off 20 at a time. Kids trudge into school, 
some dragging softball bats or lacrosse sticks. In winter, Mrs. 
Schwartz says, they carry flashlights. 
</P>
<P>
	In the cafeteria, meanwhile, three pots of coffee are waiting.

<HEADLINE> Gun Shows Prove Weapons Easy To Get </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENSBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Trench coats were banned at the  
Pennsylvania Gun Collector's Association gun show out of respect 
for the victims of the Colorado school shooting. The weapons the 
shooters used were easy to find, though. 
</P>
<P>
	At one table, William Phillips sold the kind of Hi Point 9 mm  
carbine rifle used by Dylan Klebold -- $149.99 in black or $154.99 
in chrome. For $69.99 he'll add a laser sight. The Mossburg 500 
Persuader pump-action shotgun model Eric Harris used lay on a dozen 
tables throughout space that formerly housed a department store -- 
$250 to $350. One buyer wrapped up a banned TEC DC-9 semiautomatic 
assault pistol, like the one Klebold toted -- $359. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Senate voted Friday to crack down on gun shows,  
firearms owners and dealers gathered at a gun show in America's 
heartland this weekend to barter, collect and commiserate about a 
country that has become increasingly hostile to their way of life. 
Dealers hawked everything from early American muskets to banned 
assault rifles and armor-piercing bullets. 
</P>
<P>
	But what many hoped to sell most was the message that adding to  
the nation's 30,000 gun laws won't prevent murder sprees like the 
one in Littleton, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you take all the firearms out of the hands of the honest  
citizens, there will be firearms out there in the community that 
someone has obtained illegally,'' said Richard Vensel, president of 
the Pennsylvania Gun Collectors Association, which hosted the show. 
``A criminal is not going to come to a show and try to purchase a 
firearm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Greensburg show, which saw an estimated 5,000 to 7,000  
visitors, is one of dozens being held this month at county 
fairgrounds and strip malls from Tacoma, Wash., to Watertown, N.Y. 
The shows, advertised in gun-store newsletters and Internet sites 
like www.shotgunnews.com and www.ak-47.net, draw aficionados from 
hundreds of miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	Many come for the deals. One Greensburg seller dropped his price  
on the Intratec AB-10 -- a legal version of the banned TEC-9 series 
-- from $249 to $209. 
</P>
<P>
	Others come because there's no other place to find such a broad  
array of collectibles: A $1,200 ``pre-ban'' AK-47 assault rifle. 
The armor-piercing bullets President Clinton wants to ban -- 40 
rounds for $15. Books on Daniel Boone and Thomas Jefferson. The 
World War II uniform of a Japanese naval aviator. A Union belt from 
the Civil War. A rifle stand painted with a red and black swastika 
bearing the misspelled German phrase ``Gott mitt uns'' -- God with 
us. 
</P>
<P>
	Many vendors sell large ammunition clips and assault weapons  
that were banned in 1994 but can be sold because of ``grandfather'' 
clauses in federal law. Among them are the TEC DC-9 and reloadable 
clips that hold as many as 40 bullets. The federal Brady bill 
banned the manufacture of clips holding more than 10. 
</P>
<P>
	But beyond firearms, the shows offer less tangible attractions.  
</P>
<P>
	``Friendship is what it's all about,'' said Marv Adams, who  
drove 250 miles from Perrysburg, Ohio, to show off a private 
collection that includes an 1887 rifle once owned by ``Buffalo'' 
Bill Cody, valued at $125,000. ``These are guys that collect. They 
come here and they talk guns. It's just a comradeship that we 
enjoy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adams, a white-haired insurance agent in a black blazer and  
white cowboy hat, has donated guns to the Smithsonian Institution 
and the National Rifle Association's firearms museum. He made $140 
in sales Saturday, less than he spent picking up collectibles. Most 
of the Howard Thunderbolts he sells cost about $3,000, well over 
the typical $250 to $500 gun show purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most collectors don't come here for the money,'' he said. ``If  
I sold one of them I'd immediately go out and spend the money on 
things I collect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Greensburg show is what's known as a ``controlled show.''  
Armed guards man the doors. Agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco and Firearms, here by invitation, field legal questions. 
Only sellers who have been vetted by the association can buy one of 
the $30 exhibit tables. A sign inside the door reads, ``Proper 
attire,'' meaning no white supremacist T-shirts -- and no trench 
coats. 
</P>
<P>
	But even controlled shows have their setbacks. At the March show  
a buyer was escorted out in handcuffs after police performing a 
background check turned up outstanding warrants. 
</P>
<P>
	Dealers are required to do a background check of all buyers.  
</P>
<P>
	``Selling guns is easy,'' said Rod Herrmann, director of the  
hosting association. ``It's the paperwork that's hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike many states, Pennsylvania requires even private  
collectors to do a background check of handgun buyers, which a 
dealer will perform for $5 to $10. But anyone can buy and sell 
rifles and shotguns without any paperwork. That is one of the 
loopholes the Senate bill approved Friday would close. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure isn't popular among gun enthusiasts.  
</P>
<P>
	``The girl who bought the guns in Colorado was legal whether she  
had a background check or not,'' said Phillips, owner of Bill's 
Guns in New Alexander, Pa., who sells two of the guns Littleton 
student Robyn Anderson allegedly bought for the Colorado gunmen at 
a gun show. 
</P>
<P>
	One of them, the Hi Point carbine, is a short-barreled military  
weapon designed to kill people. Pennsylvania law bars deer hunters 
from using it. But that's no reason to ban it, Phillips said. The 
Constitution's ``right to bear arms'' clause, he said, was written 
by revolutionaries eager to preserve the right of future 
generations to take up arms against people -- their oppressors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Second Amendment isn't about hunting rights,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> School Desegregation Ruling Honored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Forty-five years ago, a landmark ruling ending  
school segregation led 6-year-old Betsy Vaughn-Jackson to the doors 
of an all-white school in Kansas City, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Vaughn-Jackson, now a principal in the nearby Topeka  
district at the heart of the 1954 court case, sees little irony in 
the school system's current bid to be free of a longstanding court 
order to integrate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know the efforts the district has put forth,'' said  
Vaughn-Jackson, who runs Lundgren Elementary, which is 14 percent 
minority. ``We are keeping the message that the '54 decision gave 
us, education for all children, equally and equitably.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Brown vs. the Board of  
Education of Topeka ended states' deliberate racial division in the 
nation's schools. Two generations later, as more than 500 districts 
wrestle with court orders to desegregate, the direction of school 
integration remains uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, nationwide anniversary commemorations will include a  
ceremony in Topeka, a speech by Education Secretary Richard W. 
Riley at the Charles Sumner School Museum and Archives in 
Washington, and the launch of a White House higher-education 
equality campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, civil rights advocates argue the nation is moving  
backward, with schools more segregated than ever. But the largest 
among the school districts under court-ordered plans claim progress 
as the high court of the 1990s frees them from busing and other 
remedies they consider costly and futile. 
</P>
<P>
	Observers from both sides say this decade, which includes those  
pivotal rulings, in some way marks the end of an era. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is none of the moral urgency of Brown,'' says Gary  
Orfield, of the Harvard Project on School Desegregation. ``Federal 
courts are basically pressing lower courts to get out of the way 
and turn the authority over to local governments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Brown decision was part of a federal legal tidal wave in the  
1960s that dismantled institutions supporting racial separation. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1970s and '80s brought judicial action to cities like  
Boston, Denver and Oklahoma City, where hundreds of black children 
were bused to white neighborhoods, magnet schools opened to lure 
middle-class whites from suburbs into city centers and districts 
redrew residential boundary lines. 
</P>
<P>
	But schools systems like Norfolk, Va., and Atlanta negotiated  
themselves out of busing orders soon after plans went into effect. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991 the Supreme Court paved the way for more districts  
opting out of busing when it declared Oklahoma City Public Schools 
``unitary,'' or free from their order because they had done a much 
as possible to integrate but could not be held responsible for the 
city's racially segregated neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, dozens of districts in areas such as Cleveland, Dallas, San  
Francisco, and Buffalo have won the release Topeka is seeking. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lawyers are trying to keep every case they can away from the  
Supreme Court,'' Orfield said. 
</P>
<P>
	He cited the establishment of a more conservative federal bench  
during the Reagan and Bush presidencies and explained that state 
courts are the battleground for more recent suits. ``They believe 
the Supreme Court is the worst enemy of school civil rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not every district supports race-based remedies.  
</P>
<P>
	Prince George's County, Md., a predominantly black district, won  
the right to phase out an expensive busing plan that was created 
when the county was more integrated. 
</P>
<P>
	In Charlotte, N.C., site of the original busing-mandated remedy  
case, white parents upset over race-based transfers have filed suit 
seeking to release the district from its court order. 
</P>
<P>
	``You are going to see more parent groups, black or white, that  
are going to say this school district is unitary and should not be 
able to have race-based admissions,'' said Al Lindseth, an Atlanta 
defense attorney who has represented districts in Hartford, St. 
Louis and Savannah, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	Educational quality never should be compromised, said Barbara  
Arnwine, executive director of the Lawyer's Committee for Civil 
Rights Under Law, but there is social value in integration, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a mistake when we turn our backs on each other,'' she  
said. ``Children who are white, black, red or yellow are all going 
to meet in the workplace. If they don't know each other already, 
it's going to be hard for them to know each other as adults.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schools freed from court orders usually send children back to  
neighborhood schools. In many cities and close-in suburbs, 
desegregation plans often have failed to stem ``white flight,'' 
leaving more than two-thirds of the nation's black students in 
inner-city schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Some see economic desegregation being achieved through school  
choice. Magnet and charter schools allow poorer students 
voluntarily to attend schools in better neighborhoods or draw 
wealthier students into inner cities. 
</P>
<P>
	The Education Department, barred by Congress from handling  
busing issues longer than a decade ago, is supporting such efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	In districts freed of orders, magnet schools and other choice  
programs apparently have offset the financial and social cost of 
busing, said Lindseth, who has helped districts like Savannah 
design their plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Savannah it worked,'' he said. ``It reversed white flight  
and middle class flight and it brought some stability and 
educational enhancement to a system that needed it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New areas of litigation find integration is imperfect. Gaps in  
test scores, choice of courses, and curriculum available to 
different groups of students are leading to serious examination of 
what happens to minority students within those schools and 
classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	``Discrimination based on race has many forms and many names,''  
said Norma Cantu, the Education Department's civil rights chief.

<HEADLINE> Dumars Ends Career on Sour Note </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- It wasn't the way Joe Dumars wanted to end his  
career. 
</P>
<P>
	Dumars scored only three points in the final game of his 14-year  
career as the Atlanta Hawks beat his Detroit Pistons 87-75 in the 
decisive fifth game of opening round of the playoffs Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a fun year for me. I'm not going to make this a sad  
day at all. I'm disappointed (with the loss). I don't know what 
else to say,'' said Dumars, who got a hug from coach Alvin Gentry 
when he was taken out of the game with 51.9 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
	And then Atlanta's entire starting five hugged the 36-year-old  
guard before Hawks' coach Lenny Wilkens ran to Detroit's bench and 
added a bear hug of his own. 
</P>
<P>
	``I appreciated that. Being on the road and having the road team  
show their appreciation like that was great,'' Dumars said. 
</P>
<P>
	``And, now it's over. I wish I could stand here and tell you I'm  
disappointed, I'm sad, I'm happy. I have all those emotions wrapped 
up in one,'' Dumars said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dumars averaged 16.1 points during his career -- all with the  
Pistons -- after being a No. 1 draft pick in 1985 out of McNeese 
State. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm disappointed we lost, but I'm more disappointed that this  
was Joe's last game,'' said teammate Grant Hill, who led the 
Pistons with 21 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's meant so much to me as a leader, a teammate and a friend.  
Hopefully, he'll still be there to give me advice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dumars, who played 32 minutes and made only one of his six  
shots, said he hoped he'll be remembered for his accomplishments 
and ``that I left with class.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That he did.  
</P>
<P>
	Dumars played in 10 playoffs, helping the Pistons to consecutive  
NBA titles in 1989 and 1990. In 1990, he was named the NBA Finals 
MVP after averaging 27.3 points in four-game sweep of the Los 
Angeles Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now it's on to life after basketball. I'm going to enjoy  
myself. I've lived in Detroit 14 years now and it's my home. I 
intend to stay there,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be going to all the games and be their biggest fan,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Stackhouse, who played primarily as Dumars' backup this  
season and scored 11 points in 25 minutes against the Hawks, will 
get his chance to start next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe's had an unbelievable career. I'm proud to say I played on  
the same team with him,'' said Stackhouse. ``I can tell my kids 
some day that I played with the legendary Joe Dumars.''

<HEADLINE> Spurs To Face Lakers in Semifinals  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- The San Antonio Spurs survived the Minnesota  
Timberwolves' shoves, slaps and elbows. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Shaquille O'Neal awaits.  
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Lakers, after defeating the Houston Rockets 3-1  
in the first round with a 98-88 victory Saturday, face the Spurs in 
the Alamodome on Monday night to start their best-of-7 Western 
Conference semifinals series. 
</P>
<P>
	``A great, tough series,'' O'Neal predicted Sunday. ``We just  
have to do what we're capable of doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs beat Minnesota 92-85 on Saturday, wrapping up that  
series 3-1 in a physical game that saw -- among other skirmishes -- 
Mario Elie taking a Timberwolves elbow and needing stitches above 
his eye. And David Robinson getting a technical foul in a slapping 
and pushing match with Joe Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be as physical against L.A.,'' said point guard  
Avery Johnson. ``Shaq is as physical as the whole Minnesota team 
put together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich was glad his team kept its  
concentration and advanced to the next round despite the aggression 
of the Timberwolves. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I was pleased about is that we maintained composure and  
our mental toughness,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs will need that and more to get past the Lakers, who  
defeated San Antonio 2-1 during the regular season. The Lakers won 
two games against the Spurs in February, when San Antonio was only 
6-8 for the month. 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio won the last of the three games, in the Alamodome on  
April 24, during a stretch run that won the Spurs the Midwest 
Division title and the No. 1 seed in the Western Conference 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``They ended the season on a tremendous upside,'' said Lakers  
coach Kurt Rambis. ``They continued it in the playoffs. It's not 
going to be an easy series by any means.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal, with 37 points and 11 rebounds in the Los Angeles  
victory Saturday, is leading the league in scoring during the 
playoffs with an average of 29.5 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's playing great right now. You're not going to change  
that,'' Popovich said. ``You're not going to hold him to five 
rebounds and 10 points. It's not going to happen. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have a lot of perimeter people. Hopefully, they all won't  
play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glen Rice, the Lakers' main outside shooting threat and one of  
the team's top scorers, missed Saturday's game against Houston with 
a sore elbow. He sat out Sunday's practice. His status is day to 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal said he doesn't fear the Alamodome or Spurs 7-footers  
Robinson and Tim Duncan. 
</P>
<P>
	``No human being or stadium is going to break me,'' said the  
7-foot-1, 315-pound O'Neal. ``I know they respect my game. ... They 
have two great big men, and we have to keep it simple and play our 
game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal relishes the thought of winning a game in San Antonio,  
where he went to high school. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we play hard, the sky is the limit,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs prepared for the rough ride to come in the playoffs  
with their first-round series finale against Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	The usually mild-mannered Robinson, in his tangle with Smith,  
was already thinking ahead to the Spurs' upcoming game, whether it 
was to be a Game 5 with the Timberwolves or a semifinals series 
opener. 
</P>
<P>
	``After he slapped me in the back of the head, it got a little  
physical. I just had to think about, `I don't want to be out of the 
next game so don't do anything stupid,' '' Robinson said. 
</P>

	Robinson led the Spurs with 19 points and 11 rebounds. Duncan  
was limited to 16 points Saturday, well below his regular-season

	Robinson has faced O'Neal plenty of times, and he knows what to  
expect.

just try to keep him down and try not to let the other guys hurt 
you.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Mia Hamm tied the international scoring record  
Sunday, getting her 107th goal in the U.S. women's game against the 
Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamm, playing in her 171st game with the national team, scored  
in the 53rd minute of this exhibition leading to next month's 
Women's World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal ties Hamm with Italy's Elisabetta Vignotto, who is  
retired. It was Hamm's third career goal against the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
	She took a cross from Cindy Parlow and dribbled between two  
defenders before scoring with her left foot. The shot hit the 
crossbar and dropped in, giving the United States a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamm raised her right arm as the crowd roared, and then jumped  
and pumped her right fist. The ball was retrieved, marked with 107 
and saved for Hamm.

<HEADLINE> Cauthen Roots for Charismatic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Steve Cauthen, who rode the last Triple  
Crown winner 21 years ago, has climbed aboard the Charismatic 
bandwagon. 
</P>
<P>
	Cauthen says he'll root for the Kentucky Derby and Preakness  
winner to take the Belmont and become the 12th Triple Crown 
champion -- and the first since he and Affirmed outdueled Alydar and 
Jorge Velasquez in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's meant to happen, and if the whole thing falls  
together, it would be great,'' Cauthen said Sunday in a telephone 
interview from his home in Walton. ``Seeing stars being made -- and 
Charismatic would be a genuine thoroughbred star -- that's what 
racing needs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cauthen admits that Charismatic sneaked up on him with his  
longshot victory in the Derby. But the one-time teen riding 
sensation who now has his own breeding operation has gained a 
growing respect for the colt. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's dug in and worked hard to win his races, and looks like  
he may even have a little more left in the tank,'' Cauthen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cauthen was a mere 18 when he guided Affirmed to a Triple Crown  
sweep over archrival Alydar, culminated by a head victory as the 
two great rivals charged down the stretch in the Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each one got closer and more exciting, and the Belmont being  
the epitome of the way you'd love to win the race that was for 
everything, which it was,'' Cauthen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cauthen said it's difficult to predict how a 3-year-old  
thoroughbred will respond to the 1 1/2-mile distance of the Belmont. 
The Kentucky Derby is contested at 1 1/4 miles, the Preakness at 1 
3-16. 
</P>
<P>
	``A mile and a half is a different distance than they have ever  
run before, and probably ever will run again,'' he said. ``You 
never know until you get there. I didn't know with Affirmed until 
the day of the race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cauthen praised jockey Chris Antley for his handling of  
Charismatic in the Derby and Preakness. He said all the attention 
before the Belmont and a possible Triple Crown can also be a 
jarring ride for a jockey. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure he'll give him a good ride in the Belmont,'' Cauthen  
said. ``I just know that the next three weeks are going to be awful 
tense for him. It's a long three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure once he gets on the horse on Belmont day, he'll be  
glad that he's ready to fire it and take his chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic is the seventh horse to complete the Derby-Preakness  
double since Affirmed. The other six colts came up short in the 
Belmont -- including Silver Charm in 1997 and Real Quiet in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tough thing to pull off,'' Cauthen said. ``A horse has  
to be at 100 percent each time and you just can't afford anything 
to go wrong in between.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now retired from riding, Cauthen has moved on to other roles in  
the sport. He has a horse-breeding operation in northern Kentucky 
and is an executive at nearby Turfway Park. 
</P>
<P>
	He's also part owner of a filly sired by Affirmed. She was born  
just this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited about her,'' Cauthen said.  
</P>
<P>
	Cauthen reunited briefly with Affirmed for a ceremony at Jonabel  
Farm, marking the 20th anniversary of the horse's Triple Crown 
glory. Cauthen said Affirmed was ``looking like a teen-ager.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And though he's rooting for Charismatic, don't expect Cauthen to  
put this year's 3-year-old sensation in Affirmed's class. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't compare any horses to Affirmed because I think  
Affirmed was the best,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> New MBAs Flood Internet Businesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- At 30, Anne Stanton isn't a corporate titan. At  
least not yet. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 1999 graduate of Harvard Business School is forsaking  
job security and a fat paycheck for the potential for phenomenal 
wealth and success offered by an Internet startup she launched with 
classmates. 
</P>
<P>
	Among their peers in the newest class of Harvard MBAs, their  
gamble is not unique. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people that are on the team, they've turned down  
salaries of $150,000 and bonuses of $50,000,'' said Stanton, who 
hopes her company, LocalREWARDS.com, will be operating in 40 to 60 
markets by November. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of Harvard Business School graduates saying they plan  
to go into high-technology businesses or start their own businesses 
has been rising over the last few years, and the jump from 1998 to 
1999 has been especially robust, according to an informal student 
poll of about 45 percent of this year's students. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the poll, 8 percent of the class planned to become  
entrepreneurs, owners or partners in their first year out of 
school. That's up from just 3 percent recorded last year by the 
school's career services office. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, 25 percent expressed an interest in high-technology  
businesses, up from 11 percent last year and just 7 percent in 
1997, the student survey said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Stanton acknowledges that success as an online entrepreneur  
is not a sure thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty much job insecurity every day until you prove in  
the real world that your numbers work,'' said Stanton, whose 
company works with local businesses on loyalty programs that reward 
customers for repeat business. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvard Business School graduates have always had an  
entrepreneurial streak, with about 40 percent launching their own 
ventures at some point in their careers. 
</P>
<P>
	But the MBAs traditionally apprenticed themselves first to firms  
in corporate America for five or 10 years, then went out on their 
own. 
</P>
<P>
	That's no longer the case.  
</P>
<P>
	Professors attribute the surge of entrepreneurship to a variety  
of factors, not the least of which are investors' enthusiasm for 
giving capital to new Internet companies and a lack of established 
power brokers blocking newcomers on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the Internet, there are no entrenched authorities. It's  
being invented as we go,'' said Michael J. Roberts, a professor of 
entrepreneurial management at Harvard. ``The other piece of the 
Internet equation is the capital ... People see how much money is 
out there to fund these ventures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, PricewaterhouseCoopers released a study showing  
venture capital investments in Internet-related companies more than 
tripled from just over $1 billion in 312 firms around the country 
in 1996 to $3.5 billion in 641 companies last year. 
</P>
<P>
	But some of the new MBAs say they're most excited about building  
something new. 
</P>
<P>
	``Money's not the driving force behind it. We clearly could go  
places where we'd get paid more,'' said Asif Satchu, who is earning 
his MBA with Harvard's class of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	He passed up four job offers in the button-down worlds of  
private equity, consulting and investment banking to venture out 
into the raucous new field of Internet commerce. Now, he and a 
classmate are trying to wrap up financing on a new business, 
Suppliermarket.com, which is designed to help manufacturing 
companies manage their supply chains. 
</P>
<P>
	Graduates of Harvard's crosstown rival, the Sloan School of  
Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, have also 
taken advantage of the Internet boom. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems to be in the air,'' said Rob Carney, a 1999 MBA  
already working with a startup called Adero that helps companies do 
business on the Internet in foreign countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a lot more people are opting to go work for smaller  
startups, maybe for the excitement and the chance to build 
something. You have the change to contribute more,'' he said.

	GUADALAJARA, Mexico (AP) -- Army troops guarding evacuated  
villages on the flanks of the rumbling Colima volcano were 
withdrawn to a safer distance Sunday as concern grew among experts 
that another large eruption could occur. 
</P>

	Dozens of soldiers assigned to guard the empty houses in the  
villages of Yerba Buena in Colima state and Juan Barragan in 
Jalisco state were ordered to move further away, said Jaime Arturo

that works with the British Petroleum oil company. 
</P>
<P>
	He was seized Saturday by five armed men while traveling by taxi  
to the airport in Yopal, capital of Casanare state. Yopal is 130 
miles northwest of Bogota. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Embassy in Bogota said it had no comment on the case.

	The army blamed the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or  
FARC, which operates in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	The 15,000-strong rebel group, and the smaller National  
Liberation Army, ELN, rely on kidnapping and extortion to fund 
their war against the government.

<HEADLINE> It's Showdown Time for Penguins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- This may not be a good omen for a team facing  
elimination from the Stanley Cup playoffs: The Zamboni at the 
Pittsburgh Penguins' practice rink broke down Sunday afternoon, 
scrubbing plans for a formal practice. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the Zambonis at the training facility is already  
disabled, and the functioning machine stalled and spewed smoke as 
the driver tried to resurface the ice so the Penguins could 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the players skated on the choppy ice but most of the  
afternoon was devoted to meetings as the Penguins prepare for 
Monday night's home game against the Toronto Maple Leafs. 
</P>
<P>
	If they win, they go back to Toronto for a deciding seventh game  
in the Eastern Conference series on Wednesday. If they lose, they 
go home and wonder if the franchise will survive its bankruptcy to 
return next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of those all-or-nothing circumstances, Toronto has  
surpassed Hawaii or the Bahamas as a preferred destination. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like Toronto too much,'' Penguins captain Jaromir Jagr said.  
``I want to come back for game seven.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Maple Leafs took a 3-2 lead in games with Saturday's 4-1 win  
in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins were in the same spot in their first-round series  
against New Jersey. They rallied to win the last two games. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you've done something once, you can do it again,'' Penguins  
coach Kevin Constantine said. ``You can re-create anything that's 
happened once.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The circumstances are a little different this time. Toronto has  
stepped up its defense, holding the Penguins to a total of 30 shots 
in the last two games. Where New Jersey wilted as the series 
dragged on, Toronto seems to be improving. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've been getting better and better with each game.''  
Pittsburgh defenseman Jiri Slegr said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Maple Leafs have also found a way to bother Jagr, the NHL's  
scoring leader. Toronto's Dimitri Yuskevich is drawing most of the 
checking duties against Jagr. Jagr's frustration was evident 
Saturday. When he picked up a slashing penalty, he slammed his 
stick into the glass when he went to the penalty box. 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr has been slowed by a nagging groin injury through the  
entire series. He's also had less supporting help since forwards 
German Titov and Alexei Kovalev have missed games due to injuries. 
Titov returned on Saturday but Kovalev missed his second game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jagr might be injured but to me he's healthy as a horse,''  
Yuskevich said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins are not using the possibility of the franchise's  
extinction as a motivating issue. The Penguins currently are in 
bankruptcy proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of us want to stay in Pittsburgh,'' Constantine said.  
``But what we need to rally around is what we can control, so I 
don't think that's where our heads should be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Slegr agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``You don't want to think that this might be the last game  
because that brings you down,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Constantine said Kovalev's availability wouldn't be known until  
game time. Kovalev has a bruised foot.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Business Optimistic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) -- At first glance, Raymond  
Ackerman, chairman of one of South Africa's biggest retail empires, 
and James Mureithi, a poor black street peddler, seem to have 
little in common. 
</P>
<P>
	But both run their own businesses -- and, more tellingly, both  
typify the optimism in the business sector as the country heads 
into the June 2 national election, which the ruling African 
National Congress looks certain to win. 
</P>
<P>
	In marked contrast to the anxieties that surrounded the all-race  
vote that ended apartheid in 1994, the handover of power from 
President Nelson Mandela to Deputy President Thabo Mbeki is viewed 
without fear. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a quiet confidence he will be a very good  
president,'' said Ackerman, 68, who founded the Pick'n Pay 
supermarket chain. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the first time in years the changeover of power is not an  
angry one. You can't compare the feeling now to the feeling in 1994 
or the 1980s when we were standing on the edge of a cataclysm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mureithi, 35, who left his native Kenya three years ago to  
search for a better life in South Africa, agrees. 
</P>
<P>
	``The elections are just like you or me changing jackets. It is  
no big change,'' he said, standing in front of a stall of African 
trinkets he sells to tourists in Cape Town. ``I think the 
government has done well and Thabo Mbeki will continue in the same 
way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So confident is the business sector in the government that it  
shrugged off a controversial appointment May 1 of a top ANC 
official to a key post in the central bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Deputy Finance Minister Gill Marcus is a ruling party  
stalwart, making her appointment highly sensitive, economists 
praised her economic know-how and expressed confidence she would 
act independently of her former political bosses as a deputy 
central bank governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Hampered by apartheid-era policies and years of isolation from  
the world economy, things have not been easy for ordinary South 
Africans in the first five years of black rule. 
</P>
<P>
	The currency, the rand, has suffered several collapses, at least  
500,000 jobs have been shed and the global economic crisis in 
developing markets -- which started in Asia in 1997 -- has hit the 
country hard as foreign investors pulled out funds. 
</P>
<P>
	But the ANC has stuck firmly to market-friendly tactics of  
controlling government spending and paying off its debts. 
</P>
<P>
	While that policy outraged ANC allies in the Communist Party and  
the labor movement, it has won over many international investors 
and made friends in big business. 
</P>
<P>
	The policy also helped South Africa weather the economic storms  
far better than other emerging markets such as Indonesia and 
Malaysia, which were forced to slash government spending programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``South Africa did not escape entirely because they had to raise  
interest rates, but they did not have to make any severe adjustment 
to their fiscal plans,'' said Hania Farhan, an economist with FBC 
Fidelity Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Farhan predicts no economic growth this year, she  
forecasts 2.5 percent growth for 2000. Even the notoriously shaky 
rand has been steady for months. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, a nasty shock in the election could upset all that.  
</P>
<P>
	Any outbreak of violence similar to the bloodshed that almost  
derailed the 1994 election could see foreign investors pull out in 
droves and shatter business confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	However, despite a handful of isolated incidents, political  
tensions are low. Politicians from all sides are campaigning openly 
in their opponents' strongholds, even in areas like KwaZulu-Natal 
that would have been off limits five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Most importantly the key issue of the election -- the result -- is  
already clear. 
</P>
<P>
	Opinion polls consistently show ANC support well over the 50  
percent it needs to maintain its commanding majority in parliament. 
With Mandela having adopted an increasingly ceremonial role, Mbeki 
has already been effectively running the country for several years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The truth is that everybody knows who is going to win,'' said  
Farhan ``It is no big deal and there will be no big changes.

<HEADLINE> Rubin Replacment: Strong Dollar Key </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANGKAWI, Malaysia (AP) -- A strong dollar is in the United  
States' national interest, U.S. Treasury Secretary-designate 
Lawrence Summers said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Secretary Rubin and I have seen this the same way for many  
years,'' he said. ``A strong dollar is very much in America's 
national interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is the first time Summers has commented on the dollar since  
he was nominated for the post of treasury secretary. Last week, 
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin submitted his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers made his remarks following a weekend gathering of  
Asia-Pacific finance ministers. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers said that a strong dollar benefits the United States by  
helping lower inflation and trade income. 
</P>
<P>
	``Experience suggests that nations can't devalue their way to  
prosperity,'' he added, referring to pressures to allow a lower 
currency to boost exports. ``The dollar should not be used as a 
tool of trade policy.''

<HEADLINE> Cells May Give Tip Off on Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Looking for cells at the earliest stage of going  
bad may help doctors identify still-healthy men who are at high 
risk of developing prostate cancer, the most common male 
malignancy. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors say that checking for these pre-cancerous cells could  
offer the male equivalent of the Pap test, the routine screening 
that identifies cervical cancer in its early curable stage. 
</P>
<P>
	These pre-cancerous growths are called high-grade PIN, short for  
prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. While experts have suspected 
for more than a decade that this is cancer in the making, a study 
released Sunday is the first to show what happens to men with these 
cells. 
</P>
<P>
	The research, conducted among military veterans in Boston, found  
that older men with high-grade PIN have a 50-50 chance of 
developing prostate cancer, double the usual risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, doctors are unsure what to do with this information.  
There is no good evidence yet that taking out these men's prostate 
glands will ward off death from cancer, although this is possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``High-grade PIN definitely predicts for a high risk of prostate  
cancer,'' said Dr. Christopher Nauman of Boston University School 
of Medicine. ``We have to watch them very closely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nauman presented his findings at a meeting in Atlanta of the  
American Society of Clinical Oncology. 
</P>
<P>
	His team reviewed the outcome of men who underwent prostate  
biopsies between 1989 and 1993 because blood tests hinted at 
possible cancer or doctors felt lumps in their prostates. Sixty-one 
had high-grade PIN, while 47 did not. After seven years of 
follow-up, prostate cancer was found in 49 percent with high-grade 
PIN, compared with 21 percent of the other men. 
</P>
<P>
	There were too few cancer deaths in either group to show whether  
knowing men's PIN status improved their chances of survival. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the men were relatively old -- their average age was 69 --  
doctors did nothing beyond watch them closely. Doctors are often 
reluctant to operate on older prostate patients, because they may 
die of something else before slow-growing prostate tumors cause 
serious problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, prostate cancer is the leading malignancy among  
men, and it trails only lung cancer as a cancer killer. This year, 
doctors will diagnose about 180,000 cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of routine PSA -- prostate-specific antigen -- testing,  
doctors are increasingly finding prostate cancer in men in their 
50s. At that age, more aggressive treatment may be worthwhile to 
catch the cancer before it escapes the prostate gland. 
</P>
<P>
	``This study is important, because if you find PIN in a young  
man, you have to be very suspicious that he will soon have 
cancer,'' said Dr. Deborah Kuban of Eastern Virginia Medical School 
in Norfolk. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, doctors recommend that men with high-grade PIN  
undergo repeat biopsies every three to six months. 
</P>
<P>
	While doctors compare high-grade PIN to the pre-cancerous stages  
of cervical cancer, there are significant differences: Checking for 
cervical cancer involves a simple Pap test, which examines cells 
swabbed from the surface of the cervix. Looking for PIN is much 
more difficult, because it requires sticking a needle into the 
prostate to extract cells for examination. 
</P>
<P>
	Early detection of prostate cancer is especially important,  
because the cancer can be cured only if treated before it has 
spread. However, researchers are examining new strategies intended 
to stop the disease by harnessing the body's immune and genetic 
defenses. 
</P>
<P>
	A variety of genetic errors cause prostate cancer. Among them  
are malfunctioning p53, a gene that ordinarily triggers cancerous 
cells to commit suicide, and overproduction by a gene that makes 
Her2, a protein that prompts cells to divide. 
</P>
<P>
	At Sunday's session, Dr. Christopher Logothetis of M.D. Anderson  
Cancer Center in Houston described preliminary results of an 
attempt to improve the results of prostate surgery by injecting the 
gland first with a virus that carries in good copies of the p53 
gene. 
</P>
<P>
	In a study on 26 men, he showed that this approach made the  
tumors shrink, possibly improving the chances that prostate-removal 
surgery will be more effective. 
</P>
<P>
	In another approach, Dr. Nicholas James of the University of  
Birmingham in England tested a hybrid antibody that targets the 
Her2 gene. In 25 men with spreading cancer, it lowered blood signs 
of malignancy and eased pain. The treatment is similar to 
Herceptin, a newly approved drug being used against breast cancer.

<HEADLINE> Bad Men Featured in Cannes Movies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANNES, France (AP) -- They're scared, weak, mean or unreliable.  
They're neurotic, hypochondriacal, tyrannical or just plain stupid. 
</P>
<P>
	We're talking about men -- more specifically, male characters in  
films at Cannes this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The 52nd annual festival isn't yet halfway through, so it's  
early to declare a trend. But judging from films in competition so 
far, it isn't looking good for the Y chromosome. 
</P>
<P>
	Take the film that's generated the best buzz so far: ``All About  
My Mother,'' by Spanish director Pedro Almodovar. There's a reason 
it isn't called ``All About My Father'' -- the dad in question has 
become a transvestite called Lola and left the family unit. 
</P>
<P>
	The mother, Manuela, is a strong, decent woman. A nurse, she  
appears in instructional videos on organ transplants, playing the 
wife who must sign a consent form donating her husband's organs. 
</P>
<P>
	In a melodramatic twist typical of Almodovar, Manuela takes her  
17-year-old son to the theater for his birthday, then sees him run 
over by a car as he chases an actress for her autograph. Soon, it 
is Manuela who must sign the same dreadful consent form. 
</P>
<P>
	We follow Manuela from Madrid to Barcelona, where she hooks up  
with three other women, all with huge problems of their own. The 
always-fascinating Almodovar, aided by great acting, focuses 
successfully on their resilience and humor. Nowhere is a good man 
to be found. 
</P>
<P>
	Another promising film was ``Wonderland,'' by British director  
Michael Winterbottom. It, too, looks at a group of women -- three 
sisters -- and their troubled search for happiness, focused on one 
long weekend in London. 
</P>
<P>
	Nadia looks for dates through singles ads. One is so unappealing  
that Nadia needs to sneak out of the bar; another raises her hopes, 
then seduces her and moves on. 
</P>
<P>
	Her sister, Molly, is about to give birth when her husband  
panics, quits his job and disappears, leaving her to go through 
labor and childbirth alone. And Debbie, the other sister, is 
raising an 11-year-old son alone. Her irresponsible ex-husband asks 
for money and loses the boy in an amusement park. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there was ``Kadosh,'' an Israeli film about ultra-Orthodox  
Jews that depicts their lives as bleak and restrictive -- and 
nightmarish for the women. Two sisters, Rivka and Malka, experience 
loneliness, rejection, physical pain and worse. 
</P>
<P>
	All, of course, at the hands of the men in their lives and in  
their community, the ultra-Orthodox neighborhood of Mea Shearim in 
Jerusalem, where marriages are arranged, sex is for procreation 
only and a sterile woman is cast off. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, there was the German film ``Moloch,'' directed by a  
Russian, Alexander Sokourov. In this movie there is no argument 
about the quality of the lead male character: He is Adolf Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
	Needless to say, Hitler is presented here with all the qualities  
he is known for, and then some. The film depicts his relationship 
with young Eva Braun. With her, he is tyrannical, irrational, a 
hypochondriac and lots of other unappealing things. 
</P>
<P>
	To be fair, Eva is no picnic, either, and for that matter  
neither is the film; many left a press screening early to escape 
the tedium. 
</P>
<P>
	With all these depressing characters, it was a relief to see  
Sean Connery drop into the festival to promote his new film, 
``Entrapment,'' out of competition. As the cheering crowds 
affirmed, the original James Bond is still looking pretty good.

<HEADLINE> Rubin Sees Economy Still Strong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Departing Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin on  
Sunday said a Republican push for a major tax cut could sidetrack 
the nation from what he predicted would be sustained economic 
growth and low inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin, who will step down in July, said the budget surplus gives  
the nation a ``historic opportunity'' to ensure the long-term U.S. 
economic health. 
</P>
<P>
	``If instead we have a broad-based tax cut, we can consume that  
surplus ... (and) throw away an enormous opportunity to promote our 
economic well-being for a long time to come,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	With budget surpluses expected to continue into the foreseeable  
future, Republicans want to set aside $1.8 trillion in Social 
Security surpluses over the next decade to save the retirement 
system and use the rest, some $778 billion, for tax cuts. The 
administration has proposed much smaller and targeted tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Does the country, Rubin asked on ABC's ``This Week,'' ``in  
effect institutionalize fiscal discipline by paying down public 
debt, or do we in effect dissipate those surpluses on broad-based 
tax cuts?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin praised President Clinton for sticking to a strong fiscal  
policy ``from the day he walked into the Oval office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said he was unfazed by a jump in the consumer price index  
that caused a dip in the stock market Friday. The most likely 
scenario for the future, he said, remains one of solid growth and 
low inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the world economy remains in a ``very unhealthy  
situation'' with the United States the only major economy with 
robust growth, Rubin said. ``Most particularly it is critically 
important that Japan get back on track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin, who oversaw one of the longest periods of sustained  
economic growth in the nation's history, is returning to New York, 
where he was chairman of Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co., before he succeeded 
Lloyd Bentsen as Treasury secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has nominated Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers  
to take over the post. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said he thought about resigning last year, ``but we had an  
awful lot going on,'' including a world financial crisis sparked by 
turmoil in Asia, and the Monica Lewinsky affair.

<HEADLINE> Two Killed in Iowa Twisters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOGAN, Iowa (AP) -- Tornadoes swept through western Iowa on  
Sunday, killing two people and injuring at least 14, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The names of those who died were not released pending  
notification of relatives, said Jim Seymour, a hospital 
administrator. 
</P>
<P>
	A tornado that developed near Logan in Harrison County at about  
4 p.m. destroyed six homes, damaged several others and destroyed a 
bridge on a rural gravel road, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to piece all this together,'' said Harrison  
County Sheriff Terry Baxter. ``We're looking at possibly three 
tornadoes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All of the injured are from Harrison County, Seymour said. Logan  
is about 20 miles northeast of Omaha, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Highway 30 and Iowa Highway 127 were closed due to  
extensive damage reported in the area, including downed trees and 
power lines. 
</P>
<P>
	In Pottawattamie County, authorities reported two tornadoes  
touching down about 5 p.m. northwest of Treynor near State Highway 
92, one of them reportedly more than a mile wide. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw it tear through some houses and a couple of barns went  
up and then the tornado maxed out,'' said Matt Ver Steeg, a storm 
spotter for Des Moines station KCCI-TV. 
</P>
<P>
	Pottawattamie authorities said there were no reports of  
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 12 west-central and central Iowa counties were under  
tornado warnings Sunday as a cell of thunderstorms worked its way 
across the state.

</P>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Mary Lou Conrad, a longtime figure in  
Indiana Democratic politics who wrote former Sen. Birch Bayh's 
signature campaign theme song, ``Hey, Look Me Over,'' died Friday. 
She was 64. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of death was not available.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Conrad's marriage to Larry Conrad, the state's former  
secretary of state, brought her into politics. But she wrote her 
own footnote in political history in 1962 when, as a worker in 
Bayh's first senatorial bid, she wrote ``Hey, Look Me Over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The jingle became popular and won a national song-writing award.

<P>
	NEW LONDON, Conn. (AP) -- John ``Jack'' Cruise, who covered  
eastern Connecticut sports for more than 60 years for The Day, died 
Friday. He was 85. 
</P>
<P>
	Cruise was honored over the years by many of the leagues and  
people he covered. 
</P>
<P>
	The Eastern Connecticut Conference gave him a lifetime pass to  
its events in 1979, the year he retired from The Day. The Coast 
Guard Academy presented Cruise with the game ball from its 1991 
series-finale with Trinity, a rivalry that started in 1933 and a 
game he covered. He also received the 1995 Media Award from both 
the Eastern College Athletic Conference and the Sports Information 
Directors of America. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are all going to miss Jack very much. He was a man of  
exceptional qualities. No one knew more about the sports he covered 
than Jack Cruise,'' said Day publisher Reid MacCluggage. 
</P>
<P>
	Born and educated in New London, Cruise began working at The Day  
shortly after his 1931 high school graduation. He enlisted in the 
Army and became a decorated veteran of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife, two daughters, three grandchildren  
and four great-grandchildren.

<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Wilfred Keyes, who led the effort to desegregate  
Denver's public schools, died Friday after a long battle with 
diabetes. He was 74. 
</P>
<P>
	Keyes was behind a 1969 discrimination lawsuit filed against  
Denver Public Schools by a group of parents of minority students. 
</P>
<P>
	The same year Keyes and the other parents filed the lawsuit,  
U.S. District Judge William Doyle ruled Denver schools were 
intentionally segregated and schools in the downtown area were so 
inferior that they denied equal access to education. He ordered 
desegregation of northeast Denver schools. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court ordered the complete  
desegregation of the Denver school system. Mandated busing began 
the next year. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Richard Matsch ended court-ordered busing in  
1995, saying the schools had been integrated as much as possible. 
Keyes expressed displeasure with the decision.

<P>
	BRENHAM, Texas (AP) -- Bobby Wilson, a running back who led  
Southern Methodist University to the national championship in 
football in 1935, died Saturday following a mild heart attack on 
Wednesday. He was 85. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson caught the winning touchdown pass in SMU's 20-14 victory  
over Texas Christian University on the final day of the 1935 
regular season for the Southwest Conference championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams went into the game undefeated. TCU, led by  
all-American quarterback Sammy Baugh, went on to beat Louisiana 
State University, 3-2, in the Sugar Bowl. SMU went to the Rose 
Bowl, where the Mustangs lost to Stanford, 6-0, but still received 
the Grantland Rice Trophy, symbolic of the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson was one of the first inductees of the Texas High School  
Hall of Fame. He's also in the Texas Sports Hall of Fame and in the 
National Football Foundation Hall of Fame, which recognizes the 
nation's top college players.

</P>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Geoffrey Wigoder, veteran broadcaster, scholar  
and a leading editor of the Encyclopedia Judaica, died April 9 of a 
brain hemorrhage after a fall. He was 76. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Leeds in north England, Wigoder earned degrees in  
medieval Jewish history from Trinity College and Dublin and Oxford 
universities. 
</P>
<P>
	While studying at Jewish Theological Seminary in New York, he  
met his future wife Devorah MacDwyer, who was converting to Judaism 
from Roman Catholicism. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple immigrated to Israel in 1949 and settled in  
Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1950s, Wigoder directed the overseas broadcasts of  
Israel radio and in the 1970s was a correspondent for the BBC and 
the Yorkshire Post. 
</P>
<P>
	He collaborated with Cecil Roth, a well-known Judaica scholar at  
Oxford and Hebrew University in Jerusalem, on the one-volume New 
Standard Jewish Encyclopedia. The two then began work on what was 
to be the 16-volume Encyclopedia Judaica. When Roth died in 1970, 
Wigoder took over as editor. 
</P>
<P>
	Wigoder's credits also include The Encyclopedia of the Jewish  
Religion, ``Jewish Art and Civilization'' and ``The Story of the 
Synagogue.'' His Dictionary of the Jewish-Christian Dialogue was

<HEADLINE> Source of Bovine TB Still Unclear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALPENA, Mich. (AP) -- The clatter and rumble of tractors and  
cultivators, the mooing of cows in the pasture -- usually familiar 
sounds on Mike and Kathy Warner's farm. But not this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Michigan Department of Agriculture destroyed the Warners' 21  
cows last summer after one tested positive for deadly bovine 
tuberculosis. The farm was placed under quarantine for a year, 
off-limits to livestock. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've taken a beating,'' Mike Warner says, gazing out at the  
empty barnyard. 
</P>
<P>
	His was the first of three farms in Michigan's northeastern  
Lower Peninsula where cattle infected with bovine TB were 
discovered in the past year. In each case, the entire herd has been 
put to death -- 173 cows altogether -- as officials scramble to 
prevent an epidemic that could devastate the state's livestock 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The source of the disease, spread through breath and body  
fluids, is uncertain. But farmers believe it comes from whitetail 
deer that roam the region's forests and fields, sometimes mingling 
with cattle. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 200 deer killed in the area since 1994 have been  
infected -- the only sustained outbreak of bovine TB among 
free-ranging wildlife ever documented in North America, the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture says. 
</P>
<P>
	The situation has sparked a clash between two powerful interest  
groups: farmers, who demand a sharp reduction in the deer 
population to curtail the spread of bovine TB; and hunters, many of 
whom doubt that deer are to blame and fear their sport is under 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Also weighing in are people who do business with farmers, as  
well as the tourism industry, which relies on crowds of visitors 
during fall hunting season. 
</P>
<P>
	Alpena's three biggest motels rented a combined 4,000 fewer  
rooms last year than in 1997, largely because of a dropoff in 
hunter traffic, says Dick McElroy, executive director of the local 
chamber of commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	Bovine tuberculosis is a chronic lung disease that weakens and  
kills animals. It could make people sick if they drank 
unpasteurized milk containing the bacterium, although milk sold in 
supermarkets is pasteurized and would pose no threat. 
</P>
<P>
	Nor would eating beef from infected cattle affect humans because  
the bacterium attacks the lungs and lymph nodes, not muscle tissue 
that people consume, state wildlife biologist Steve Schmitt says. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers say it's hard to overstate the risk to their livelihood.  
</P>
<P>
	State officials have ordered testing of all cattle in an  
11-county area between Lake Huron and Interstate 75. Its 
southernmost point is about 170 miles north of Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	The've also imposed a quarantine requiring updated testing of  
cows shipped from there unless headed directly to slaughter. 
</P>
<P>
	The stigma has hampered sales of breeder cattle -- even those  
free of bovine TB. 
</P>
<P>
	``The buyers tell us, `You can test them every day but I still  
don't want those cows,''' says Galen Schalk of Montmorency County, 
whose dairy farm has about 225 cattle. 
</P>
<P>
	It was quarantined for six months last year after tests showed  
seven cows might be infected. They eventually were cleared; in the 
meantime, Schalk was barred from shipping animals to market. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were tying up calves to gas tanks, to trees. Calves that  
were healthy one day were sick the next and dead the next, just 
because they were in an environment that we knew they couldn't 
survive very well in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He lost about $4,000.  
</P>
<P>
	If the USDA revoked Michigan's status as free of bovine TB, it  
would require tests of any cattle shipped elsewhere and could cost 
the state economy up to $156 million over a decade, a university 
study found. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, the agency is planning to classify only the affected  
area of Michigan as ``non-modified TB-accredited.'' Federal and 
state officials are working out the details, said Joe VanTiem, a 
USDA animal tuberculosis specialist. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas, California, Pennsylvania and New Mexico also have  
``modified'' status because TB-infected cows or bison have been 
detected there in the past five years, VanTiem said. TB has been 
detected on a farm in North Dakota. Its status will change if 
another infected herd is discovered there in the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers in Michigan's northeast are grudgingly accepting the  
cattle tests but want something done about deer, believed to number 
about 150,000 in the bovine TB area. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they find one cow that tests positive for TB, they kill the  
whole herd,'' dairyman Mike Tulgestke says. ``All we're asking for 
is to reduce the deer herd to the point that they're not spreading 
this stuff any more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The TB outbreak may have been worsened by hunters who place  
crops such as sugar beets and carrots in the woods through the 
winter, says Joe VanTiem, a USDA specialist in animal tuberculosis. 
</P>
<P>
	Deer normally keep apart while foraging, but congregate around  
large food piles, breathing and coughing on each other. 
</P>
<P>
	The heavily wooded northeastern Lower Peninsula is home to  
numerous hunting clubs. Some have dumped truckloads of vegetables, 
attracting hundreds of deer. 
</P>
<P>
	That may explain why all confirmed bovine TB cases have been in  
that region, says Keith Creagh, state deputy agriculture director. 
</P>
<P>
	His department last year prohibited feeding there, but a judge  
ruled in March the agency had exceeded its authority. Supporters 
are pushing the legislature for a statewide ban. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a state commission has restricted baiting -- using  
food piles during hunting season to lure deer within shooting 
range. 
</P>
<P>
	The clampdown angers advocates of feeding deer.  
</P>
<P>
	``It'll wipe out deer ... the first time we have a hard  
winter,'' says Brian Jenich of Detroit, who has a hunting camp in 
the TB zone. He says the area is overgrazed and feeding is 
essential to prevent mass starvation of deer. 
</P>
<P>
	Jenich is among hunters who contend bovine TB never disappeared  
from the region's cattle and that cows might have infected deer 
instead of the other way around. 
</P>
<P>
	The Warners, whose cattle were destroyed, say they're too busy  
recovering from the disease to debate its origin. 
</P>
<P>
	Their herd's appraised value was $20,000, most of which the  
state reimbursed. But they've lost thousands in cattle sales, not 
to mention the hay they sold at a discount because of fears it was 
tainted. 
</P>
<P>
	Their barns and equipment have been disinfected, and the  
quarantine on their farm ends June 29. They're trying to get a loan 
to start over. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have a dime to buy a cow,'' says Warner, 49, who left  
his phone company job four years ago and moved north to pursue a 
lifelong dream of farming. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have a good solution to the TB problem ... but I hope  
somebody can come up with one or this area is going to lose its 
shirt.''

<HEADLINE> New Star Emerging in Indy Racing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- With Arie Luyendyk retiring and Tony Stewart  
driving in NASCAR, the name-starved Indy Racing League is looking 
for a new hero. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Ray, a 32-year-old who never has won a race, might be the  
personality the 4-year-old Indy-car series needs to make new fans 
and carve some inroads into NASCAR's burgeoning popularity. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray, with movie star looks and an articulate manner, also has  
proven to be fast on the race track. He started second in last 
year's Indianapolis 500 and has started from the front row in both 
races this season, going from No. 2 in Orlando and winning his 
first career pole in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	His best finish so far, though, was second in the race at Texas  
Motor Speedway last June while still running for the underfunded 
team of Thomas Knapp, a close friend and now his engineer. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Ray is among the favorites to win May 30 in the 83rd  
running of the Indy 500, thanks to his move into the seat at Team 
Menard left vacant when 1997 series champion Stewart moved 
full-time to the Winston Cup series this season. 
</P>
<P>
	That has given lots of confidence to Ray, who has been fastest  
on each of the first two days of practice at the Indianapolis Motor 
Speedway.

	Saturday, Ray's fast lap was 225.887 mph. Sunday, the cool Texan  
led the way in his primary car at 225.124 and was third in his 
backup Dallara-Aurora at 224.674. 
</P>
<P>
	``My confidence is changing,'' Ray said. ``Last year, we knew  
there were holes in our arsenal. We didn't have the countermeasures 
and insurance measures built into our program. We were fast, but we 
just didn't have the backup plan, the backup people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He pointed to the fact that John Menard's team has won races and  
a championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're a championship team, you have things built into  
your arsenal to deal with problems,'' Ray said. ``The key thing 
with a team like this is there are some very good people around 
you. ... We also have good chemistry. You can trust everybody. You 
can count on everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite all that chemistry, isn't the winless Ray at least a  
little uncomfortable in the role of favorite at Indy? 
</P>
<P>
	``My dad disagreed with me in 1997 when I first showed up here  
for my first Indy 500 and thought that I was the favorite to win 
the race,'' Ray said, smiling. ``I don't want anybody to take this 
the wrong way. I have high expectations of myself. I've never been 
in a race car not expecting to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no fifth or 10th. Racing is about winning. That is why  
I got involved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forty cars made laps Sunday on the 2 1/2-mile oval, with two-time  
Indy winner Luyendyk sandwiched between Ray's cars at 224.674. 
Two-time runner-up Scott Goodyear was next at 222.750, followed by 
defending IRL champion Kenny Brack and former series champion Scott 
Sharp, both at 222.288. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, who plans to race in both the Indy 500 and the  
Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte, N.C., May 30, arrived Sunday after 
finishing 15th in a Winston Cup race Saturday night at Richmond, 
Va. 
</P>
<P>
	He quickly got up to speed in his new Tri Star Motorsports  
entry, turning a fast lap of 222.091. 
</P>
<P>
	Billy Boat, last year's pole winner, was the first to hit the  
wall since practice opened Saturday. Brack's A.J. Foyt Racing 
teammate lost control exiting turn one and skidded backward into 
the concrete barrier.

<HEADLINE> Salt Lake Tries To Get Past Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Finally, the focus in this Olympic city is  
shifting to the Olympics themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	After six months of scandal, organizers of the 2002 Winter Games  
are putting all their efforts toward the event now just 999 days 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	When they begin four days of meetings with International Olympic  
Committee officials Monday, leaders of the Salt Lake Organizing 
Committee will be able to point to positive developments and hope 
that the worst is behind them. 
</P>
<P>
	The people who live here seem to agree.  
</P>
<P>
	Some 15,000 people jammed an outdoor amphitheater Saturday  
night, spilling onto grassy slopes and parking-garage rooftops to 
get a look at the latest saviors of the sullied games -- a venture 
capitalist from Boston and three stuffed animals counted upon to 
fill SLOC's nearly bare coffers. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitt Romney, the third president SLOC has had since winning the  
games four years ago, talked about heroes and how they can make a 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are not just people sitting on the couch eating  
Doritos,'' Romney said after a film of past American Olympic 
champions. 
</P>
<P>
	He then turned the stage over to an Indian storyteller, who  
introduced the long-awaited mascots of the games -- a snowshoe hare, 
a coyote and an American black bear. 
</P>
<P>
	They were chosen because of their historic links to the original  
settlers of the Wasatch range. The story goes that each played a 
part in making this region of snowy mountains and briny lakes a 
good place to live. 
</P>
<P>
	They also were picked because of their appeal to modern  
consumers. Focus groups told SLOC that these three critters would 
sell, and long lines formed at souvenir booths where the first 
mascot T-shirts, caps and pins went on the market almost as soon as 
the new Olympic ambassadors made their debut. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're buying things, that helps, too,'' said Romney, casually  
clad in chinos and a winter vest made by one of the three new 
corporate partners SLOC introduced Friday, the first major signings 
since long before the scandal broke in November. 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC estimates the mascots will account for the core of $40  
million-$50 million in merchandise sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The whole night was billed as ``Putting a new face on the  
Games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great organization that has been blighted,'' said  
Barbara Butler, a retired schoolteacher who was among the crowd. 
``We can get it on the right track again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC's 18-member coordination commission meets with the SLOC  
for the first time since the $1 million scheme to buy the votes of 
members was revealed. The panel is led by Marc Hodler, a venerated 
member from Switzerland who helped blow the whistle on Olympic 
corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	The scandal, the worst in Olympic history, has resulted in a  
purge of 10 members, the creation of panels that could drastically 
redo the IOC. It also has prompted at least six investigations, 
including ones by the Justice Department and the Utah attorney 
general's office that would report their findings for weeks or 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	But the commission will look ahead, with meetings on finances,  
transportation, ticket sales, media operations and dozens of other 
areas involved in staging a modern Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	It will visit sports venues, most of which are ready for use,  
and get a feel of how Salt Lake has emerged from the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney, who was brought in to replace Frank Joklik at the height  
of the scandal in February, is looking to close a $300 million gap 
in sponsorships and has proposed $84 million in cuts to SLOC's 
$1.45 billion budget. Some of those proposed cuts would effect when 
and how the IOC receives its share of revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	The stain of the scandal has not disappeared, although it now  
appears deepest far away. The IOC continues to investigate alleged 
abuses of power by Phil Coles, a prominent member from Australia, 
but even that case keeps Salt Lake in the mix. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles was warned for accepting lavish hospitality from Utah  
bidders and now is being looked at for allegedly funneling 
Australian government dossiers on other IOC members, part of 
Sydney's successful quest for the 2000 Summer Games, to Salt Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles has denied any wrongdoing and the lawyer for Dave Johnson,  
the former No. 2 official in Salt Lake's bid who resigned in the 
scandal, said there was ``nothing inappropriate'' in any role Coles 
might have played.

<HEADLINE> Lukas Finally Has Triple Crown Shot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- D. Wayne Lukas has trained the winners of 12  
Triple Crown races, but never a Triple Crown champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of the things that are not on my resume,'' said  
Lukas, whose horses have earned almost $200 million. ``I'd love to 
have it. The chance comes along so seldom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On June 5, a strapping chestnut named Charismatic can become the  
12th Triple Crown champion and first since Affirmed in 1978 by 
winning the 1 1/2-mile Belmont Stakes. A victory would make Lukas the 
10th trainer of a Triple Crown winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunny Jim Fitzsimmons and Ben Jones each trained two Triple  
Crown champions. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's starting to figure it out,'' Lukas said Sunday on the  
morning after Charismatic added a victory in Preakness to his 
triumph in the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Now maybe the bettors will start to figure out that Charismatic  
is for real. 
</P>
<P>
	His Derby victory was worth $64.60, the third largest in the  
race's 125-year history. It was treated by many handicappers and 
fans as a fluke -- a good-luck trip in a crowded field -- and so he 
went to the post Saturday at Pimlico as an 8-1 shot. 
</P>
<P>
	That made him the longest-priced Kentucky Derby winner in the  
Preakness since Dark Star was 11-1 when he finished fifth in 1953. 
</P>
<P>
	It's certain Charismatic will be a short price in the Belmont.  
After all, he is fast becoming charismatic. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Chris Antley, Charismatic moved to the threshold of  
racing immortality by sweeping past horses on the turn, opening a 
three-length lead with about one-eighth of a mile remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	At the wire, he was 1 1/2 lengths ahead of Menifee, with Badge  
another head back and 2 1/2 lengths ahead of Stephen Got Even in the 
field of 13 3-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
	The time for the 1 3-16 miles was 1:55.32 after rapid opening  
fractions of 22.50 for the quarter mile and 45.27 for the half. 
</P>
<P>
	This will be the third straight year the Triple Crown has been  
on the line in the Belmont. Silver Charm failed by three-quarters 
of a length in 1997 and Real Quiet was a nose short last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic is owned by Bob and Beverly Lewis, owners of Silver  
Charm, trained by Bob Baffert, also the trainer of Real Quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he has the style and strength to get it done,'' Lukas  
said of Charismatic, who was racing for the fourth time in 42 days. 
It was his third straight win. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic will go back to Lukas' barn at Churchill Downs on  
Monday. He probably will have his final Belmont workout there on 
June 1, then be flown to New York from Louisville the next day. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas said Cat Thief, third in the Derby and seventh in the  
Preakness, will skip the Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	The Belmont could have 10 to 12 starters and expected to take  
another shot at Charismatic are Menifee, Badge and Stephen Got 
Even. 
</P>
<P>
	Menifee, also second in the 1 1/4-mile Derby, is trained by Elliott  
Walden, trainer of Victory Gallop, who finished second last year in 
the Derby and Preakness, then beat Real Quiet in the Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Got Even's performance pleased trainer Nick Zito in the  
wake of his 14th-place finish in the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Badge paid a show price of $18.80, the same as Charismatic's  
winning mutuel return, in his first start since finishing fourth in 
the Wood Memorial on April 10 at Aqueduct. 
</P>
<P>
	It appears Baffert won't have a horse in the Belmont.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think I'm getting off at this bus stop,'' he said after his  
filly Excellent Meeting was pulled up by jockey Kent Desormeaux 
because of a breathing problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``She couldn't get her air,'' Dr. Larry Bramledge, a  
veterinarian, said after the race. ``It's like asthma in people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We scoped her and she's OK,'' Baffert said. ``We think she may  
have displaced (her soft palate) and lost her air.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trip to Baltimore certainly was anything but a failure for  
Baffert. He won the Pimlico Special on May 8 with Real Quiet and 
then won the Black-Eyed Susan on Friday with the filly 
Silverbulletday, who was scratched from the Preakness after getting 
the No. 14 post. 
</P>
<P>
	Trainer Randy Morse said it appeared Torrid Sand (11th) also  
displaced his palate and would require arthroscopic throat surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Belmont probables include Lemon Drop Kid, ninth in the  
Kentucky Derby; Comeonmom, second in the Remsen at Aqueduct in his 
start in November; Best of Luck, second in the Wood Memorial; 
Vision and Verse, the Illinois Derby winner; and Pineaff, third in 
the Illinois Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Comeonmom is owned by Godolphin Racing, operated by members of  
the Maktoum family of United Arab Emirates. Godolphin's Worldly 
Manner, a good seventh in the Kentucky Derby in his first start 
this year, went off as third betting choice in the Preakness and 
finished 12th after being in position to win on the final turn.

<HEADLINE> Smart Car May Lose Funding Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAMBURG, Germany (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler chief Juergen Schremp  
has threatened to cut investment in the mini Smart car if sales do 
not improve within six months, a newsmagazine reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Schremp, as quoted by the Der Spiegel report, said he would  
``turn off the money tap'' if he does not see a dramatic climb in 
orders for the cartoonish, two-seater car, which is built at a 
plant in Hambach, France. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler, which invested $1.1 billion in developing the  
Smart model, stands to lose an additional $1.1 billion to $1.6 
billion if the car fails, the magazine reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Although production was geared toward selling 140,000 Smart  
models this year, Schremp said the goal is now to sell 80,000 cars 
-- or else the project will have to be reconsidered, according to 
Der Spiegel. 
</P>
<P>
	Daimler already has changed management of the Smart unit,  
lowered prices and launched a sweeping ad campaign to improve 
sales, the magazine said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Smart car, which went on sale across Europe on Oct. 2, was  
developed by Micro Compact Car AG, a joint venture between 
Daimler-Benz and Swatch Group, the Swiss manufacturer of the Swatch 
wristwatch. In November, Swatch sold its stake in the project to 
Daimler. 
</P>
<P>
	The 8.25-foot-long car takes up just about half of a standard  
parking spot and runs on around a third less gas than its compact 
rivals. With its mix-and-match, brightly colored replaceable parts 
and all-plastic body, the car is aimed at a young market.

<HEADLINE> LA Museum Has 24-Hour Exhibit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- At 3 a.m., some yawned and rubbed their eyes  
to stay awake while taking in the paintings of Vincent van Gogh. 
Others sipped $7 martinis, while live jazz played in the 
background. Kids fell asleep while their parents marveled at the 
Impressionist masterpieces. 
</P>
<P>
	Many more were waiting behind them, despite the early hour,  
eager to take advantage of a last chance to see the exhibit of 70 
paintings from the van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam. 
</P>
<P>
	``We both work during the day,'' Brenda Arevalo said early  
Saturday as her husband nodded, their 5-month-old son fast asleep 
in a baby carrier. ``All the other shows were sold out, but this 
hour was well worth it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the final weekend of the show that opened in January, the Los  
Angeles County Museum of Art became the first in the nation to open 
a major exhibit round-the-clock, from 9 a.m. Friday to midnight 
Sunday-- 63 continuous hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Those attending between midnight and 7 a.m. got in for half  
price, $10. 
</P>
<P>
	And not all kids had trouble staying awake.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was an interesting exhibit, pretty good,'' said Chris  
Wenell, an 11-year-old who paints. ``It's worth coming out this 
late for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the farewell weekend, the museum also opened Club van Gogh,  
an open-air terrace where night owl art lovers sampled fancy 
snacks, pricey drinks including $3 bottled water and music from a 
jazz sextet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been trying to get tickets forever and I'm a night person  
so this is perfect,'' said Shannon Ward. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the exhibit opened Jan. 17, an estimated 820,000 people  
have viewed the artwork -- about 6,800 people each day.

<HEADLINE> 'Mummy' Hangs On to Top Spot / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``The Mummy'' held on to No. 1 at the box  
office over the weekend, earning $25.1 million, according to 
industry estimates released Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The weekend was considered a wasteland by most studio  
executives, who feared moviegoers would hold off in anticipation of 
``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace.'' The film opens 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	That may account for the unusually high number of smaller films  
in the top 10, according to Robert Bucksbaum, a Reel Source Inc. 
film analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't usually want to open a film five days before the  
most anticipated film of the decade, and perhaps of all time,'' 
Bucksbaum said. ``When you do, you're either hoping to get 
spillover audience from the sold-out 'Star Wars' shows, or you're 
trying to appeal to a totally different audience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Mummy,'' a horror-adventure film about a group of  
explorers who accidentally resurrect an ancient Egyptian priest has 
become the season's biggest moneymaker, taking in $80.8 million 
since its release two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The cat-burglar caper ``Entrapment'' was No. 2 with $8.7 million  
in weekend earnings, while ``The Matrix'' was third with $4.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	``William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream,'' starring  
Kevin Kline, Michelle Pfeiffer, Stanley Tucci and Calista 
Flockhart, opened this week in fourth place with $4.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Black Mask,'' a Hong Kong martial arts thriller, opened in  
fifth place with $4.2 million. It stars Jet Li as a mild-mannered 
librarian who becomes a masked crimefighter. 
</P>
<P>
	The urban comedy ``Trippin','' about a rambunctious teen-age  
daydreamer, debuted in seventh place with $2.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In limited release, ``Tea With Mussolini,'' the story of a boy  
raised by eccentric Englishwomen in World War II Italy, landed in 
10th place. The film, showing in 270 theaters, earned a per-screen 
average of $6,296. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated grosses for Friday through Sunday at North American  
theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Inc., with final figures 
to be released Monday: 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``The Mummy,'' $25.1 million.  
</P>

<HEADLINE> Procter-Gamble Suit Vs. Amway Nixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- A lawsuit alleging that Amway distributors  
revived false rumors linking Procter &AMP; Gamble with satanic cults 
has been thrown out by a federal judge. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Vanessa Gilmore dismissed the lawsuit  
Saturday, two weeks into its trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit is one of several that Cincinnati-based Procter &AMP;  
Gamble brought after rumors began circulating in 1981 that the 
company's logo -- a bearded, crescent man-in-the-moon looking over a 
field of 13 stars -- was a symbol of Satanism. 
</P>
<P>
	The company alleged that Amway distributors, including several  
from the Houston area, revived the rumors in 1995, using a voice 
mail system to tell thousands of customers that part of Procter &AMP; 
Gamble's profits go to satanic cults. 
</P>
<P>
	Elaine Plummer, a spokeswoman for Procter &AMP; Gamble, said the  
company plans to appeal the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the judge threw out the lawsuit because a federal judge  
in Utah had dismissed a similar case in March against Amway. The 
Utah judge ruled the rumors were not defamatory and that Procter &AMP; 
Gamble hadn't made a case for specific damages. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been advised this is an error because the cases are  
different legally and factually,'' Plummer said. ``The (Houston) 
judge had already ruled that we had presented sufficient evidence 
of Amway's liability and that our case could go to the jury. We 
look forward to a retrial of our case as soon as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Amway Corp., based in Ada, Mich., said its distributors  
never spread the rumors. 
</P>
<P>
	``For years, Amway tried to work with Procter and Gamble to  
squelch this tall tale,'' said Michael Mohr, vice president and 
deputy general counsel for Amway. ``When the rumor refused to die, 
Procter and Gamble embarked on a corporate strategy to blame one of 
its competitors for a silly story that has been widely told among 
many groups throughout the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Procter &AMP; Gamble trademark originated in the mid-1800s,  
Plummer said. The 13 stars represent the 13 original colonies and 
the man-in-the-moon was a popular decorative symbol of the period.

<HEADLINE> Oldest White House Tree Enters Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Evergreen and graceful, the tree has survived  
the branch-whipping blast of countless helicopters, stubborn 
starlings, a suicide airplane and 17 decades of presidential 
history. Andrew Jackson would be proud. 
</P>
<P>
	It is a stately Southern tree, a Magnolia grandiflora with  
glossy dark-green leaves, supported in its old age by a web of 
steel wires and a 30-foot-tall, telescopic iron pole sunk seven 
feet into the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the oldest tree on the White House grounds, so rooted in  
the history of the place that it appears on the back of older $20 
bills, rising to the roofline just about where Jackson and his 
gardeners planted it to the left of the long-columned South Portico 
facing the Potomac. 
</P>
<P>
	When the magnolia blooms in late June or early July it produces  
creamy and fragrant white blossoms, eight to nine inches across. 
</P>
<P>
	White House lore, passed on through a long line of presidential  
gardeners, cherishes the Jackson magnolia as the rough-hewn, 
battle-winning, whip-tongued president's tribute to his gardening 
wife, Rachel Donelson Jackson, who died before he reached 
Washington in 1829. 
</P>
<P>
	There's a touch of irony in that. After a campaign in which she  
and her husband had been accused of adultery, bigamy and other 
offenses, Rachel Jackson was not looking forward to moving to the 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of God than live  
in that palace in Washington,'' she had cried. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin Williams, who began working at the White House a  
half-century ago and is now chief gardener, says the Jackson 
magnolia ``creates an atmosphere, a structure of something living'' 
as it reaches up to screen the private family quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	There's a reasonable chance the venerable magnolia will live  
well into the next century, even with a hollow center and evident 
signs of decay on its lower limbs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hoping for another 50 years myself,'' Williams said.  
``These old trees, they look bad on the surface, but on the inside 
they're determined to keep going. Like anything old, it wants to 
stay alive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're doing everything we can to keep it as healthy as  
possible,'' Williams said. ``It's declined some. But not a whole 
lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a way that's a bit surprising. The Jackson magnolia is north  
of its usual range. Harsh winters are a worry. But the White House 
wall at the tree's back shelters it from the worst winter storms, a 
factor Williams said was critical when it was newly planted. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-four presidents have lived at the White House since  
Jackson and his magnolia has been there with all of them. Reporters 
turn their backs against the prop blast when the presidential 
helicopter takes off and lands, and they watch the magnolia shake 
and shiver. 
</P>
<P>
	When the White House interior was rebuilt in the 1950s,  
Jackson's tree was moved carefully to safety, then returned. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sept. 12, 1995, a pilot, apparently bent on suicide, aimed a  
stolen Cessna 150 at the White House. Falling just short, the plane 
cut a groove in the South Lawn and barked against the magnolia's 
trunk. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's still a scar on the tree,'' Williams said.  
</P>
<P>
	Persistent birds are a more common problem.  
</P>
<P>
	``The tree is a haven in winter for the starlings; flocks of  
hundreds and hundreds of them,'' Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	The starlings are noisy, and not very considerate. ``They  
plaster the patio with droppings,'' the gardener said. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams placed a rubber owl and rubber snakes in the magnolia's  
high branches to scare them off. 
</P>
<P>
	``The crows took to sitting on top of the rubber owl and it  
didn't bother the starlings either,'' he said. ``They were not 
scared. They still come back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trees and the White House have always been linked. ``Trees  
should be planted at once so as to make it an agreeable place to 
walk in,'' a government official said in 1800. 
</P>
<P>
	An American elm, believed to have been planted in John Adams'  
time, hung on until 1991. First lady Barbara Bush replaced it with 
a young tree propagated from the old one. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 500-plus trees on the 18-acre White House grounds, more  
than 40 are commemoratives, including a scarlet oak planted by 
Benjamin Harrison in 1889 and a Japanese Threadleaf maple planted 
by first lady Frances Folsom Cleveland in 1893. Bill and Hillary 
Clinton have planted eight, including white dogwoods and a 
littleleaf linden. 
</P>
<P>
	In ``The White House Garden,'' published in 1996 by the White  
House Historical Association, William Seale calls the presidents' 
trees ``an unsung glory'' that help express ``the continuity of 
this place through time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Generations of trees have been planted, grown and died,''  
Seale writes. ``New generations always replace them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the Jackson magnolia is the exception.  
</P>

<HEADLINE> Pippen Can't Bring Ring to Rockets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- They looked so good on paper, but another  
superstar didn't bring the Houston Rockets another championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Scottie Pippen arrived in January with six NBA championship  
rings earned in Chicago to replace the retired Clyde Drexler. 
</P>
<P>
	Hakeem Olajuwon had new spring in his aging legs after an  
off-season of intensive workouts and Charles Barkley came back from 
two off-season surgeries looking fit and charged. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen signed a five-year, $67.5 million contract and expected  
to blend immediately with Olajuwon and Barkley, the Rockets' 
resident superstars. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't happen.  
</P>
<P>
	Pippen reached mid-season without feeling fully acclimated to  
his new surroundings and teammates. He complained he couldn't 
perform if he didn't get the ball and finished the regular season 
with career lows in many categories, including his 14.5-point 
scoring average, the lowest since his rookie year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was definitely a big challenge for me, coming to  
Houston,'' Pippen said. ``If we were not going to be able to win a 
playoff game or get out of the first round, it would have been very 
disappointing for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They did win one playoff game, but only one as the Los Angeles  
Lakers ousted them in four games. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Rockets never got going in the lockout-shortened  
50-game schedule, they appeared to be ready to take on the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Again, it didn't happen.  
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets lost Game 1 101-100 in the final seconds when Pippen  
lost the ball and rookie guard Cuttino Mobley had the final shot 
blocked by Shaquille O'Neal. They were blown out in Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen awoke in Game 3 with a career-playoff high 37 points but  
that didn't quell his critics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't read them, I don't know what they say,'' Pippen said.  
``Other than you guys asking me about it, I never read it. The 
important thing to Scottie Pippen is to make this team win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Game 4, Pippen took 23 shots, hit only six. He was 3-for-11  
from 3-point range. Although he finished with 19 points and 17 
rebounds, only three rebounds came in the second half when the 
Lakers' youth and power overcame Houston's age and experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``Scottie, Hakeem and I would have to reach to the past to match  
what we had to go against,'' Barkley said after the season-ending 
loss. ``We did the best we could.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets were applauded for drafting two guards who made the  
starting lineup. Mobley became a fearless outside shooter and 
Michael Dickerson was an immediate slashing success. 
</P>
<P>
	Dickerson started all 50 regular season games and averaged 10.9  
points. Mobley averaged 9.9 points in 37 starts. But the rookies 
weren't ready for the playoff pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	During the season, Houston helped itself by sending guard  
Rodrick Rhodes to Vancouver for former Rocket Sam Mack, who added 
to the team's outside shooting capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston appeared to be living up to its expectations when March  
ended. The Rockets were on a nine-game winning streak with a 22-9 
record, following a run against mostly weak teams, and were closing 
in on division-leading Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the next 11 days, they lost to the Jazz twice and San  
Antonio once. They lost the home court advantage to the Lakers with 
late-season losses to NBA doormats Dallas and the Los Angeles 
Clippers, paving the way for their ouster from the playoffs in the 
first round for the second straight year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had our ups and downs,'' coach Rudy Tomjanovich said.  
</P>
<P>
	After a loss to the Mavericks April 21, Pippen was arrested and  
charged with suspicion of driving while intoxicated. He contended 
he was innocent and the charge was dismissed for lack of evidence 
on the eve of playoff Game 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Tomjanovich has a tough off-season of work ahead of him. Pippen  
has four years remaining on his contract. Barkley is mulling 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Realistically, it is going to take a lot for me to come back  
and play,'' he said Saturday. ``I'm leaning toward retirement. That 
is what is realistic. I'm not going to play just for money. I want 
to win. It all comes down to how good this team can be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They have a good youth base starting with Mobley and Dickerson,  
plus Bryce Drew and Othella Harrington. 
</P>
<P>
	But Olajuwon will be 37 in his 16th NBA season next year. Pippen  
will be 35 next season, his 13th. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to be a year older next year and I don't know  
what we can do,'' Barkley said.

<HEADLINE> Gore Calls for New Teacher Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAMONI, Iowa (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore called for tough new  
teacher tests, recruiting bonuses of up to $10,000 and 
``second-chance schools'' as he began Sunday to detail his agenda 
for his White House bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore used a commencement speech at Graceland College for the  
first in a series of public policy addresses he said would bring 
substance to his campaign for the Democratic nomination for 
president in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	He urged the hiring of 2.2 million new teachers, while making  
them pass tough tests, and said preschool programs should be 
extended ``for every child, in every community in America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A new ``teacher corps'' could offer youngsters up to $10,000 if  
they decide to go college to become a teacher, and a $10,000 bonus 
could await those who switch from other professions, Gore 
suggested. States would be encouraged to toughen teacher licensing. 
</P>
<P>
	Also needed are expanded after-school programs and more choices  
for parents within the public school system, the vice president 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Gore nor aides would say how much his proposals might  
cost. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is an agenda that is ambitious but responsible,'' Gore  
said. ``Every one of these proposals will be fully paid for within 
a balanced budget.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added: ``We must realize that education is the greatest  
anti-poverty program, the most powerful anti-discrimination 
strategy we could ever have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In light of the recent school shootings in Littleton, Colo.,  
Gore stressed school safety, promoting special ``second-chance'' 
programs for troubled youngsters. He also favored expanded family 
leave laws so parents could become more involved in their 
children's education. 
</P>
<P>
	Also part of his educational proposals:  
</P>
<P>
	-- More control for local school officials over staff, budget and  
student advancement. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Programs to identify ``failing schools'' and give parents more  
leeway in putting their children in different schools. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Wiring every classroom and library to the Internet and  
improving software. 
</P>
<P>
	-- New savings accounts allowing parents to save money for  
college expenses.

<HEADLINE> Sock Expert: Don't Use Cotton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Cotton athletic socks are worse than  
old-fashioned, a sock expert declares. 
</P>
<P>
	``State of the art today is using 100 percent synthetic  
fibers,'' said podiatrist Douglas Richie Jr. of the Los Angeles 
suburb of Los Alamitos. ``Synthetic fibers are markedly different 
from cotton or wool.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wearing the older fibers gives an athlete or a hiker a higher  
risk of foot troubles such as blisters and bruises, according to 
Richie and other experts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would avoid cotton socks at all costs,'' said podiatrist  
Stephen Pribut of George Washington University. 
</P>
<P>
	However, an official of a company that makes cotton and  
synthetic fiber socks said that, for ordinary wear, cotton will do 
fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Synthetic fibers made of such materials as polypropylene and  
Teflon are better for what socks are supposed to do, said Richie, 
who has done research on sock performance. 
</P>
<P>
	One of those functions is to wick away sweat from the foot,  
because a wet foot is more likely to blister and become infected. 
</P>
<P>
	It's like what happens skin when you spend too long in the tub,  
Pribut said: ``Your skin gets white and a little more mushy.'' 
Twisting and shearing forces make blisters form. 
</P>
<P>
	The pressure created by activity drives sweat back into the  
outside layer of skin, a covering of protein that is the remains of 
dead skin cells. The moisture softens the protein, Pribut said. 
</P>
<P>
	Movement, such as walking or running, can tear part of the outer  
layer away from the underlying live skin cells, creating a gap that 
fills with fluid, which aching hikers and runners know as a 
blister. 
</P>
<P>
	In a properly made sock, however, the movement also can pump  
sweat away from the foot, Richie said. The moisture enters air 
pockets in the fabric, and stepping squeezes the sweat out, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the process breaks down if pressure permanently flattens the  
fabric, leaving no room for air pockets, Richie said. Cotton is 
more prone to flatten, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The other part of the sweat-removal process is how to get rid of  
the sweat once it has been wicked away from the foot. Synthetic 
fabrics do this better because they dry more quickly, Richie said. 
</P>
<P>
	A denser weave makes for more air pockets and less compaction.  
Better socks have more terrycloth loops in them, Richie said. A 
buyer can tell the difference in the store simply by turning the 
socks inside out, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some newer socks also rely on a blister-prevention method that  
dates from the old days -- combining a light liner with a heavier 
outer sock. By wearing what amounts to two pair, the shearing force 
that otherwise would fall on the sock and the skin is dissipated to 
the inner and outer sock. 
</P>
<P>
	Synthetic sports socks are far from cheap. They can run $20 or  
more, although a person can get a decent pair for $8, Pribut said. 
Cotton athletic socks have the advantage of being cheap, but mere 
price does not make them acceptable to the podiatrist. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't even dream of it,'' Pribut said. ``You may not use  
cotton socks. If you are doing to use a $2 pair of cotton socks, 
forget it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Synthetics will last longer, anyway, so the cost diffference  
shrinks when you factor in the cost of constantly replacing wornout 
cotton, Richie said. ``There is value in a $20 sock,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	There are other cost factors as well. Synthetic sports socks are  
thicker, so people who buy the socks may also need new shoes, said 
Debbie Lazenby, spokeswoman for Thorlo, a synthetic sports socks 
company in Statesville, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most people purchase their footwear too small,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	And if you are not working up a big sweat, you can get by  
without synthetic sports socks, Richie said. ``Cotton is acceptable 
for casual wear,'' he said. Cotton can handle ordinary sweat, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In terms of what most people use athletic socks for, which is  
just walking around, cotton is fine,'' said Kevin Angliss, 
president of Auburn Hosiery Mills, New York City. The company is a 
sock licensee for Wilson and Converse sports socks in the United 
States and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	For workouts and games, synthetics would be better, Angliss  
said.

<HEADLINE> Rough Road Awaits NHL's Stars / Hockey Game Story  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- If the Dallas Stars want to eliminate the St.  
Louis Blues from the NHL playoffs Monday night, they'll have to 
break a trend to do it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars, the NHL's top team in the regular season, lead the  
second-round series 3-2 heading into Game 6 and so far, in contrast 
to the rest of the NHL, the home team has won every game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a homer series so far and we hope it stays that  
way,'' Blues left wing Geoff Courtnall said after the Stars' 3-1 
victory Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars scored the game's first three goals in Game 5. Yet  
coach Ken Hitchcock didn't sound all that confident about the 
chances of finishing off the Blues, who finished 27 points behind 
them in the standings. St. Louis didn't quit, and could have cut 
the gap to a goal and set up an exciting finish with 57 seconds 
left, except that rookie Jochen Hecht's goal was erased because he 
was caught in the goalie crease when he scored. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I know is that if we are going to win the next game of the  
series, we will have to play a lot better for 60 minutes than we 
did tonight,'' Hitchcock said. ``Once they got the momentum built 
up, we had a heck of a time stabilizing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis lost its first two games at home in the opening round  
while falling behind 3-1, then rallied to eliminate Phoenix in 
seven games. Games 3 and 4 against the Stars were the Blues' first 
two sellouts of the postseason, and they responded with strong 
play. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, they're facing elimination for the fourth time in the  
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nothing new to us,'' defenseman Al MacInnis said. ``We're  
not in bad shape. We're going home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If he doesn't sound desperate, perhaps it's because the Blues  
are used to do-or-die situations. They've played an NHL-leading six 
overtimes in the playoffs, winning four times. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their fans are going to be energized again and they have been  
in this situation before,'' the Stars' Joe Nieuwendyk said. ``They 
know what it is all about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The keys to the Stars' victory in Game 5 were a strong game from  
goalie Ed Belfour, who had 30 saves, and overdue production from 
their power play. The Stars, who are 4-for-46 in the series, had 
two goals in five opportunities with the man advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was nice to see some plays develop finally, and to finally  
get some goals,'' center Mike Modano said. ``It was good tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues, on the other hand, were 0-for-4 on the power play.  
</P>
<P>
	``Special teams were the key to the game,'' MacInnis said.  
``We've got to get more traffic in front of Belfour. He's seeing 
everything really well right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis knows a strong start also is important. Jere Lehtinen  
opened the scoring in Game 5 with a shorthanded goal at 3:47 and 
Jamie Langenbrunner got a power-play goal midway through the 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important to get off on the right foot, and we go and dig  
ourselves another hole,'' coach Joel Quenneville said. ``This is a 
big challenge against a top team.''

<HEADLINE> Utley Struggles with Lions' Insurer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Three months ago, former Detroit Lions  
offensive lineman Mike Utley took his first public steps since 
being paralyzed in a game eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a major step toward his goal of some day walking off the  
Pontiac Silverdome turf from the spot where he was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	But he says the triumph came despite, rather than with the help  
of, the Lions' insurer, Liberty Mutual. Utley said he has faced a 
frustrating struggle with the company over his effort to get 
treatment and rehabilitation services. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't expect a red carpet, but I don't want them throwing  
barriers in my way, either.'' Utley told The Detroit News in a 
story Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Utley, permanently a quadriplegic with a partially severed  
spinal cord, said the Lions have been supportive of him since he 
was injured, but it has been ``hard, hard, hard'' dealing with 
Liberty Mutual. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee Sommers, the Liberty Mutual claims adjuster, declined to be  
interviewed for the story, The Detroit News reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The insurance company fought paying for a rehabilitation program  
that allowed Utley to stand up from his wheelchair, and it still 
refuses to pay for a nurse to travel with him or a spotter for the 
weightlifting he uses as daily therapy, records show. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been around 25-plus years and I often say nothing  
surprises me, but that may be an exception,'' said Richard 
Berthelsen, chief legal counsel for the NFL Players Association. 
``You couldn't have a more dramatic example of a football injury, 
and a more deserving person to get every benefit under our 
collective bargaining agreement than Mike Utley. We negotiated long 
and hard for these benefits and we expect to get them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lions disavowed any knowledge of Liberty Mutual's treatment  
of Utley. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would be surprised to hear that,'' Tom Lesnau, the Lions  
vice president and chief financial officer, said. ``The Lions 
believe the law was established specifically for people like Mike 
Utley, and Mike should be the person who can collect on that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berthelsen, however, said the Lions share responsibility for the  
handling of Utley's case. 
</P>
<P>
	``The insurance company, when it's opposing a claim, needs the  
employer's cooperation,'' he said. ``If the employer didn't like 
the insurance company opposing claims, it could find a different 
company or it could instruct them that it doesn't want to oppose 
this claim. It's all about money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berthelsen said money for the benefits Utley is seeking belong  
to the players, not the Lions or Liberty Mutual. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers' Compensation benefits come out of the players' salary  
pool, he said. Even if Utley's case caused that expense to rise, 
Berthelsen said, ``There's not a player on the Detroit Lions or a 
player in this league who wouldn't vote for that additional benefit 
expense to come out of salaries and be absorbed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Utley has received $136,906 in weekly benefits through Saturday.  
Now 33, he would receive another $934,960 by age 65 based on this 
year's rate. Since the rate rises every year, the actual amount 
will be even greater. Medical bills are paid directly by the 
insurance company in addition to weekly benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Utley said he believes Liberty Mutual would save money in the  
long run if it pays for what he needs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to take anything that I don't deserve. That's  
not who I am,'' he said. ``The insurance company needs to 
understand that if they'll help me now, it's going to mean a lot 
less money later. First I must do my job, then I have to pester the 
insurance company to come forward and do their job. Why? Because 
people are going to get independent. And that is my goal.''

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Fall in Early Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar rose against the yen early Monday  
following the release of data showing Japan's current account 
surplus dropped 25.5 percent in March. Japanese stocks fell 
sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 123.20 yen in early trading, up 1.02 yen from  
late Friday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 
122.73 yen on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 268.73 points,  
or 1.60 percent, to 16,541.66 in the first 30 minutes of trading. 
On Friday, the average closed down 40.86 points, or 0.24 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar's rise above 123.00 yen came  
after Japan's Finance Ministry reported that the nation's current 
account surplus fell 25.5 percent to 1.073 trillion yen (dlrs 8.76 
billion) from the same month last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Monday, the ministry announced that Japan's current account  
surplus climbed 17.6 percent to a non-seasonally adjusted 15.227 
trillion yen (dlrs 124 billion) for fiscal year 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar last traded above 123.00 yen on March 8.  
</P>
<P>
	Dealers said the dollar could test its upside Monday, buoyed by  
the widening gap between U.S. and Japanese bond yields. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank of Japan Governor Masaharu Hayami said Friday that the  
central bank will maintain its easier monetary policy until 
deflation worries are dispelled. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's official discount rate, the interest rate charged by the  
Bank of Japan on loans to commercial banks, now stands at a record 
low of 0.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The greenback's strength also followed remarks by U.S. Treasury  
Secretary-designate Lawrence Summers, who reiterated that a strong 
dollar is in his country's national interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers made his remarks Sunday following a weekend gathering of  
Asia-Pacific finance ministers at Langkawi, a resort island off 
northern Malaysia. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers said that a strong dollar benefits the United States by  
augmenting lower inflation and trade income. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 131.65 yen, up from  
130.33 yen late Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices started sharply lower after  
fears of higher U.S. interest rates led to a big drop Friday on 
Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the Dow fell 193.87 points to 10,913.32, erasing a  
106.82-point gain Thursday, after a 0.7 percent rise in consumer 
prices in April stirred fears of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 18.60 points, or 1.38 percent, to 1,328.85. 
The TOPIX closed down 4.52 points, or 0.33 percent, on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 212 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.240 percent in early trading from Friday's close of 
1.230 percent. Its price fell to 102.33 yen from 102.42 yen Friday.

<HEADLINE> DeLay Admits Lobbying Against Dem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House's third-ranking Republican, warned  
by the House ethics committee about letting party politics dictate 
official actions, said Sunday he was ``over-passionate'' in his 
effort to stop an industry group from hiring a Democrat as its 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes I get a little over-passionate in my desire to get  
things done,'' Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, said on NBC's ``Meet the 
Press.'' ``Sometimes I say things I shouldn't say and the ethics 
committee reminded me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The committee has sent DeLay a private letter and on May 11  
released a memo to all House members making clear that government 
officials ``are prohibited from taking or withholding any official 
action on the basis of the partisan affiliation or the campaign 
contributions or support of the involved individuals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DeLay, at a meeting of House leaders last fall, lashed out at  
the decision of the Electronic Industries Alliance to hire former 
Rep. Dave McCurdy, D-Okla., as it president. The Republicans were 
pushing the lobbying group to hire a GOP lawmaker, Rep. Bill Paxon, 
R-N.Y., who retired from Congress last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very upset that this particular organization was hiring  
a very prominent Democrat to run their organization. I felt that 
with the new majority in Congress that they ought to be looking at 
Republicans,'' said DeLay, whose title in the House GOP leadership 
is Republican whip. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, there was a brief delay on an intellectual property  
bill the alliance supported. Some Republicans were quoted at the 
time as linking the postponement to the group's decision to hire 
McCurdy. 
</P>
<P>
	DeLay stressed that he was not accused of violating any ethics  
laws. ``I was not scolded. All the letter says is that I was 
reminded to watch what I say.''

<HEADLINE> Assault Charge for Man on Track </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The 22-year-old man who stood on the track at  
Pimlico as horses raced past him down the stretch was being held 
today on a first-degree assault charge, a correction official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee Ferrell, of Bel Air, Md., was being held at Baltimore's  
central booking facility, said Barbara Cooper, a spokeswoman for 
the Division of Pretrial Detention and Services. 
</P>
<P>
	Police spokeswoman Angelique Cook-Hayes said Ferrell was taken  
at first to Sinai Hospital for a psychiatric review, but was 
released from the hospital Saturday night. Hospital spokeswoman Amy 
Mickolite refused to comment on whether Ferrell had been at the 
facility, citing hospital policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident occurred several hundred yards from the finish line  
during the seventh race Saturday, about 2 1/2 hours before the running 
of the Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferrell made his way to the track from the infield, crossed a  
fence separating the fans from the turf course, staggered to the 
inside rail, which he pounded with his fist before ducking under 
it, and walked onto the main track. 
</P>
<P>
	As the horses approached, he stood with his fists clenched and  
arms upraised. As the horses charged by on both sides, Ferrell can 
be seen in videotape replays apparently punching at two horses. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to first- and second-degree assault, Ferrell was  
charged with reckless endangerment, endangering others through 
intoxication, disorderly conduct, trespassing and resisting arrest. 
He was held Sunday on $2,500 bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferrell was taken to the hospital for a psychiatric review  
because of his behavior and comments he made to officers after his 
arrest, police said Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Medicare Reported Living Woman Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Martha Lawler died in February, on a Friday afternoon, her body  
wracked by emphysema. It was the second time in 10 months. 
</P>
<P>
	The first time, in April 1998, neither she nor anyone who knew  
her was aware of her death. She went along with her daily life in 
Indianapolis, breathing oxygen from tanks, making an occasional 
foray to a restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, in June, she heard the news: She was dead.  
</P>
<P>
	Somehow, Medicare had gotten word of her passing and had cut off  
reimbursements for the oxygen that kept this 83-year-old woman 
alive. When Social Security was informed, it stopped her monthly 
payments of $994. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the last months of her life, Mrs. Lawler tried again and  
again to tell the government she was very much alive; at the same 
time, she tried to find out why anybody thought she was dead in the 
first place. 
</P>
<P>
	She had her suspicions, but it wasn't until a month after she  
died that those suspicions were confirmed: After she fired a 
hospice company, Odyssey HealthCare, it reported her dead. 
</P>
<P>
	The company blames a keypunch error; an investigation is under  
way. But no probe is necessary to prove that a dying woman was 
forced to endure needless misery because of the actions of Odyssey 
and the government. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one would help us,'' says Mrs. Lawler's daughter, Jane  
Joyal. ``Everyone would say, `Oh yes, it's fine.' 
</P>
<P>
	``But it wasn't. It just got worse.''  
</P>
<P>
	Her mother had been healthy most of her life. A widow since  
1968, she had worked for Indiana Bell Telephone in the repair 
department; she raised four children, lived to see 13 
grandchildren; and enjoyed the quiet pleasures of collecting 
thimbles and paperweights. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, she was diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary  
disease. The downward spiral began -- bouts of pneumonia and then an 
ever-increasing need for oxygen. Insurance and Medicare paid the 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, her health worsened. ``In order to go out, I  
would have to take her in a wheelchair to my car,'' her daughter 
says. Still, she would go out to eat on occasion, a small oxygen 
tank in tow. 
</P>
<P>
	All the while, she was in and out of the hospital. But last  
year, Dr. Linda Huck told the family she should be kept at home and 
made comfortable. She recommended that Odyssey be engaged to manage 
her care. 
</P>
<P>
	Odyssey has 21 offices, with headquarters in Dallas. Its aim,  
according to the company Web site, is to ``serve all people during 
the end of life's journey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The site poses a frequently asked question: ``Is there any  
special equipment or changes I have to make in my home before 
hospice care begins?'' Answer: ``Your hospice provider will assess 
your needs, recommend any necessary equipment, and help make 
arrangements to obtain it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And indeed, when Odyssey case manager Debi Vaughn came to Mrs.  
Lawler's apartment April 7, 1998, she had a lot to say. ``You do 
need our services, and this is what we're going to do,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	You need a new hospital bed, Ms. Vaughn said. And a new oxygen  
provider. And we're going to put you on new medications. The 
government will pay for it all. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Lawler said she wanted to talk to her daughter.  
</P>
<P>
	``You need this,'' Ms. Vaughn replied.  
</P>
<P>
	(This is how Mrs. Lawler described the meeting to her daughter.  
Ms. Vaughn no longer works for Odyssey and could not be reached for 
comment.) 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, Ms. Vaughn called Mrs. Lawler several times.  
</P>
<P>
	Finally, Mrs. Joyal talked to the case manager. Her mother was  
happy with her old bed, Mrs. Joyal said, and she wanted the oxygen 
tanks, not a machine that produced oxygen, as Ms. Vaughn had 
insisted. It was too noisy, and what if the power went off? 
</P>
<P>
	``Every hospice group has providers they use,'' Mrs. Joyal  
recalls being told. ``This is our provider, and this is who we will 
be using.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Vaughn met the next Monday, April 13, with Mrs. Joyal, her  
brother and her mother. According to Mrs. Joyal's account, she 
finally told Ms. Vaughn, ``Mother doesn't want your services.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Vaughn begged the family to reconsider.  
</P>
<P>
	``Your mother is in our computer,'' Ms. Vaughn said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Then take her out,'' Mrs. Joyal replied.  
</P>
<P>
	``No, you don't understand. She's in our computer.''  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Vaughn was asked to leave, and she did, but with some  
parting words: ``You know, Mrs. Lawler, you will be sorry. ... You 
do need our services.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two months later, June 12, Mrs. Joyal heard from her mother's  
oxygen provider, Apria: ``You know, Mrs. Joyal, we have a problem. 
Medicare has refused to pay their portion because your mother is 
dead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her mother cried. She feared that her lifeline, her oxygen,  
would be cut off. (It never happened; Apria continued to make 
deliveries, believing it eventually would be paid.) 
</P>
<P>
	When Mrs. Joyal called Medicare, she was told her mother had  
been reported dead April 13 -- the day of the last meeting with Ms. 
Vaughn. 
</P>
<P>
	Social Security officials said Mrs. Lawler would have to come  
into the office, with identification, to prove she was alive. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really was an effort,'' Mrs. Joyal says. She had to pack up  
her mother, her wheelchair and her oxygen and drive her to the 
office. But at least Mrs. Lawler was assured that the problem had 
been solved. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, on July 3, her Social Security money did not arrive.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Joyal called Social Security. Sorry, she was told; Mrs.  
Lawler's death was still in the computer, but now it was fixed. A 
week later, an emergency check arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Lawler was trapped in an endless loop. Each month, her  
payment did not arrive; each month, she was told that the error had 
finally been fixed. And the next month, it would happen again. 
</P>
<P>
	In September, Social Security deducted $1,988 from Mrs. Lawler's  
bank account -- the May and June payments she received after her 
reported death. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a matter of not fixing everything that needed to be  
fixed,'' explains Mary Mahler, a spokeswoman for Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	Social Security workers deleted all references to Mrs. Lawler's  
death from their computer system, she says, but because Medicare 
still listed her as dead, the computer refused to issue her checks. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Lawler wrote to Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., requesting his  
help. Lugar put his deputy state director, Lane Ralph, on the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Ralph went to the Health Care Financing Administration, which  
administers Medicare, and asked: Who reported Martha Lawler dead? 
</P>
<P>
	The answer, as Mrs. Lawler suspected, was Odyssey HealthCare.  
</P>
<P>
	Authorities traced the report to a billing form filed  
electronically by Odyssey on April 13. In one field, an Odyssey 
worker should have typed 30 -- code for ``patient ended services'' -- 
but instead typed 40. 
</P>
<P>
	In other words, ``expired at home.''  
</P>
<P>
	According to Pat Skogan, Odyssey's vice president of clinical  
and regulatory affairs, this was a mistake, pure and simple. All 
other records, she says, accurately explained that Mrs. Lawler was 
alive, and had chosen to drop Odyssey's service. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the company now double-checks its discharge lists each  
month. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a big company,'' Ms. Skogan says. ``Human error does  
exist. We're very sorry that this happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Was Ms. Vaughn overly zealous in her dealings with Mrs. Lawler?  
Ms. Skogan says the case manager was merely giving Mrs. Lawler 
enough information to make an informed consent, under the law. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, she would have had to change beds. Mrs. Lawler was renting  
from one equipment supplier, and Odyssey rented from another, Ms. 
Skogan says. As for the oxygen, she says the company would have 
arranged to deliver it in tanks. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Skogan says the Indiana Department of Health and the Health  
Care Financing Administration have informally cleared Odyssey of 
any wrongdoing. But a HCFA spokesman in Washington, speaking on 
condition of anonymity, says the investigation is not finished. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Social Security's role in all of this, its spokeswoman  
Mahler says the agency is ``very sorry this happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mahler says upon receiving reports of deaths, Social Security  
does not wait for death certificates. Instead, it cuts off benefits 
and relies on the undead to come forward and set the record 
straight. 
</P>
<P>
	Martha Lawler spent her last months ``worried, worried,  
worried'' about her Social Security and Medicare benefits, says her 
daughter. In her last days, she did receive hospice care, from St. 
Vincent's Hospital. She died at home Feb. 19 and was buried at 
Washington Park East Cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
	It was April 12 -- 365 days after Mrs. Lawler was falsely  
reported dead, and nearly two months after she actually died -- 
before Social Security repaid the last dollars she was owed.

<HEADLINE> LA Museum Has 24-Hour Exhibit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- They came. They ogled. They yawned.  
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of museum-goers said it was worth staying up all night  
and standing in line in the pre-dawn hours to see paintings by 
Dutch master Vincent Van Gogh before the artwork returns to 
Amsterdam. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles County Museum of Art became the first U.S.  
museum to open a major exhibition around-the-clock -- a total of 63 
continuous hours. Sunday was the last day to see the 70-piece 
collection, ``Van Gogh's Van Goghs: Masterpieces From the Van Gogh 
Museum, Amsterdam.'' 
</P>
<P>
	People were able to view the display any time between 9 a.m.  
Friday and midnight Sunday. Anyone attending between midnight and 7 
a.m. got in for $10 instead of the usual $20 admission. 
</P>
<P>
	This being Los Angeles, there was a cast of characters who  
attended the sold out 3 a.m., 4 a.m., 5 a.m. and 6 a.m. showings. 
``I know L.A.,'' said Carlos Vaca, a 24-year-old bartender. ``This 
fits in everyone's schedule.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The museum also for the first time opened Club Van Gogh, an open  
air terrace and penthouse featuring fancy snacks, $3 bottled water, 
$7 Van Gogh martinis made of Dutch gin and Pernod, and music from a 
jazz sextet. 
</P>
<P>
	The indoor area of the club was lit in soft blue and warm red  
lights. Puzzle pieces of Van Gogh's paintings were strewn on 
tables. Booths touted discounted ``Starry Night Specials'' of Van 
Gogh T-shirts and catalogs. 
</P>
<P>
	Jon Ingalls, who lives and works just blocks away, didn't feel  
compelled to visit the show until it became 24-hour Van Gogh. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think many art exhibits are open at 2 a.m., so I had  
to get here in the middle of the night,'' the 22-year-old 
documentary filmmaker said. ``I also came for my first-ever 
martini, the Van Gogh martini, but it isn't very good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His 18-year-old companion, Kelly Hardy, is an art history  
student at the University of California at Los Angeles. ``I came 
for the novelty of it all,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Janet Phillips, 18, of Huntington Beach, rested her blistered  
feet as she looked through her bag of souvenirs. One family brought 
their 5-month-old son and drove 1 1/2 hours from their home near Big 
Bear to see the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been trying to get tickets forever and I'm a night person  
so this is perfect,'' said 22-year-old Azusa elementary school 
teacher Shannon Ward. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the Van Gogh exhibit opened Jan. 17, an estimated 820,000  
people have viewed the artwork -- about 6,800 people each day. The 
last exhibit to attract such attention was the ``Treasure Houses of 
Britain,'' which brought in 990,474 visitors to the National 
Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., in 1985.

<HEADLINE> Injured Agassi May Miss French Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUESSELDORF, Germany (AP) -- Andre Agassi injured a shoulder  
Sunday during the World Team Cup, jeopardizing his start for the 
French Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very serious injury,'' said Halmut Krahl, the  
tournament doctor who examined Agassi and will treat him the next 
few days. 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi's bursitis flared while trailing 4-3 in the first set,  
and he was forced to quit. He was playing Nicolas Escude during the 
United States' match against France. 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi will skip the rest of the team tournament, a clay-court  
warmup for the French Open, which begins May 24. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cold and the heavy balls are too dangerous for my  
shoulder,'' Agassi said. ``I don't want to risk my small chance of 
playing in the French Open.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The same injury forced Agassi into a one-month layoff after he  
won a tournament in Hong Kong in April and caused him to withdraw 
at Monte Carlo three weeks ago.. 
</P>
<P>
	He returned at last week's Italian Open, where he was beaten by  
Australia's Pat Rafter. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States won its opening match 2-1 as Pete Sampras beat  
Cedric Pioline 7-5, 6-4 and Richey Reneberg and Jonathan Stark 
defeated Guillaume Raoux and Pioline 6-2, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
	After his victory, Sampras felt confident about the French Open,  
despite recently losing his world No. 1 ranking to Russia's Yevgeny

<HEADLINE> High School Center Enters NBA Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PICAYUNE, Miss. (AP) -- Picayune High center Jonathan Bender, who  
broke Michael Jordan's record with 31 points in the McDonald's 
All-America game, said Sunday that he had declared himself eligible 
for the June 30 NBA Draft. 
</P>
<P>
	By beating a midnight Sunday deadline to make his intention  
known to the NBA, the 6-foot-11 Bender backed out of a national 
letter of intent that he signed with Mississippi State. 
</P>
<P>
	An NBA spokesman said the league won't make an official  
announcement of early entries until Friday. At least 15 players 
have declared for early entry in the draft, with Bender the only 
high school player among the group. 
</P>
<P>
	Bender didn't have an expected news conference to announce his  
decision, said Sunday that he was going to turn pro. 
</P>
<P>
	Bender averaged 25 points, 15 rebounds and six blocked shots a  
game as a senior at Picayune. But it was his performance in the 
March 25 McDonald's game, when he broke Jordan's scoring record, 
that increased his draft status. 
</P>
<P>
	If Bender is a lottery selection as projected, and taken among  
the top 13 picks in the NBA draft, he could make about $9 million 
his first three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Thaddeus Fouchier, Bender's summer-league team coach, said the  
youngster's draft position was too good to pass up. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were told that Jonathan is the only high school player who  
would go among the top eight to 10 picks in the draft,'' Fouchier 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a new NCAA rule, high school players are ineligible to  
play college basketball once they apply for the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	The underclassmen who have declared themselves eligible for the  
NBA draft are Ron Artest from St. John's, William Avery, Elton 
Brand and Corey Maggette of Duke, Carl Boyd of California; Baron 
Davis of UCLA; Steve Francis of Maryland; Dion Glover of Georgia 
Tech; Richard Hamilton of Connecticut; Jumaine Jones of Georgia; 
Lamont Long of New Mexico; Jamaal Magliore of Kentucky; Shawn 
Marion of UNLV; and Albert White of Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	NCAA players can return to college if they don't sign with  
agent, regardless of draft status.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton at Hollywood Fund-Raiser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In California for a Hollywood bash to raise  
$2 million for Democrats, President Clinton urged the entertainment 
industry Saturday to re-evaluate the way it portrays killing in 
light of the Littleton, Colo., shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	The president asked a star-studded crowd to consider whether  
violent movies and video games don't desensitize children who 
already feel alienated from their peers and their families. 
``Desensitizing them will be more likely to push those that are 
vulnerable into destructive behavior,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That doesn't make anybody who makes any movie or any video  
game or any television program a bad person or personally 
responsible for one show with a disastrous outcome,'' he was quick 
to add. ``There's no call for finger pointing here. But we just 
look around and we know all these things go together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But in his speech and in his weekly radio address the president  
implored entertainment leaders to reflect upon their responsibility 
in molding the nation's young. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is still too much violence on our nation's screens,  
large and small,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton hopes the killings at Columbine High School will  
galvanize the public behind a national campaign against youth 
violence. As he headed to a Los Angeles dinner with some of the 
biggest names in Hollywood, Clinton challenged the entertainment 
industry to review its ratings systems and reconsider the effects 
on children of glorified screen violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every one of us has a role to play in giving our kids a safe  
future, and those with greater influence have greater 
responsibility,'' Clinton said. ``We should see movies and music, 
TV programs, video games and advertising for them made by people 
who made them as if their own children were watching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, he challenged the industry to stop showing guns in  
ads and previews children might see; to strictly enforce ratings 
systems at video stores and theaters; and to re-evaluate the 
ratings system, especially the PG rating, ``to determine whether it 
is allowing too much gratuitous violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton stopped briefly at movie mogul Lew Wasserman's home en  
route to the dinner at Greystone Mansion, an elegant, hilltop 
Gothic landmark owned by the city and often used as a set for 
movies and television programs. Among its recent credits: ``Murder 
She Wrote,'' ``Witches of Eastwick,'' ``Winds of War,'' and 
``Ghostbusters II.'' About 100 anti-war protesters waited at the 
bottom of Greystone's winding drive with placards decrying NATO's 
airstrikes in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The guest list for the event hosted by DreamWorks partners  
Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen, included Meg 
Ryan, Dennis Quaid, Goldie Hawn, Kurt Russell and Whoopi Goldberg. 
Political glitterati were headed by House Minority Leader Dick 
Gephardt and Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., criticized Clinton  
for taking money from some of the same people Lott blamed for an 
increasing laxity in morals. 
</P>
<P>
	``This weekend, the Clinton-Gore regime will be begging for cash  
from one of the polluters responsible for our nation's moral 
decline,'' he said in a statement issued by his office. ``What's 
the message to our children? Democrats care about your safety -- 
unless it's inconvenient to their partners in Hollywood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's focus on the entertainment business' influence on the  
climate of violence in America rankled some industry chiefs, and 
there was some thought that some might withdraw their support for 
Saturday's fund-raiser to benefit House and Senate Democrats in 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Party officials said no one had backed out to protest Clinton's  
remarks on violence. Not even Edgar Bronfman Jr., chief executive 
officer of the Seagram Co. Ltd., who shortly after Clinton hosted a 
White House conference on youth violence last week publicly scoffed 
at those who would link the Littleton killings to television and 
movies. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unfortunate that the American people who really look to  
their government for leadership instead get finger-pointing and 
chest-pounding,'' said Bronfman, who as the chief executive of 
Universal Studios' parent company oversees an empire that includes 
movies, music and theme parks. 
</P>
<P>
	Bronfman wasn't attending Saturday's event, but he wrote the  
party a check for an unspecified amount this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee political director  
Michael Meehan said the dinner raised ``more than $2 million'' and 
drew 135 people, none of whom expressed concern about Clinton's 
recent scolding of the entertainment industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Folks have been very supportive,'' Meehan said. ``We reached  
our goal and then some. That's the most tangible sign of support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From events in Seattle, the San Francisco Bay area and Los  
Angeles, Clinton continues Sunday to fund-raisers in San Diego and 
Las Vegas. The four-day take is expected to reach more than $3 
million for Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, who plans to visit Littleton with the first lady  
Thursday, applauded Hollywood for its voluntary ratings system for 
TV shows and the V-chip to enforce parents' decisions on what 
children may watch. 
</P>
<P>
	But still, he said, the typical American sees 40,000 dramatized  
murders by age 18. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are still too many vulnerable children who are steeped  
in this culture of violence, becoming increasingly desensitized to 
it and to its consequences and, therefore, as studies show, 
hundreds of them more liable to commit violence themselves,'' the 
president said. 
</P>
<P>
	He lashed out again at the Republican-led Senate for passing new  
gun-show restrictions that he said were ``riddled with new 
loopholes.'' ``If the Senate wants to fix the problem, it should 
fix the problem, not make it worse,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> New MBAs Flood Internet Businesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Graduates of Harvard Business School have always  
had an entrepreneurial streak, with about 40 percent launching 
their own ventures at some point in their careers. 
</P>
<P>
	With their freshly minted Masters of Business Administration  
degrees, new grads traditionally apprenticed themselves first to 
firms in old-fashioned corporate America for five or 10 years, then 
struck out on their own. 
</P>
<P>
	But these days, students are taking advantage of their MBAs and  
the Internet revolution to rush out of business school and into 
their own firms. 
</P>
<P>
	``Money's not the driving force behind it. We clearly could go  
places where we'd get paid more,'' said Asif Satchu, a Harvard MBA 
candidate this year. 
</P>
<P>
	He passed up four job offers in the button-down worlds of  
private equity, consulting and investment banking to venture out 
into the raucous new field of Internet commerce. Now, he and a 
classmate are trying to wrap up financing on a new business, 
Suppliermarket.com, which is designed to help manufacturing 
companies manage their supply chains. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of Harvard Business School graduates saying they plan  
to go into high-technology businesses or start their own businesses 
has been rising dramatically over the last few years, and the jump 
from 1998 to 1999 has been especially robust, according to an 
informal student poll of about 45 percent of the class of 1999's 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a poll, 8 percent of the class members plan to  
become entrepreneurs, owners or partners in their first year out of 
school. That's up from just 3 percent last year, according to the 
school's career services office. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, 25 percent expressed an interest in high-technology  
businesses, up from 11 percent last year and just 7 percent in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Professors attribute the surge of entrepreneurship to a variety  
of factors, not the least of which are investors' enthusiasm for 
giving capital to new Internet companies and a lack of established 
power brokers blocking newcomers on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the Internet, there are no entrenched authorities. It's  
being invented as we go,'' said Michael J. Roberts, a professor of 
entrepreneurial management at Harvard. ``The other piece of the 
Internet equation is the capital. ... People see how much money is 
out there to fund these ventures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, PricewaterhouseCoopers released a study showing  
venture capital investments in Internet-related companies more than 
tripled from just over $1 billion in 312 firms around the country 
in 1996 to $3.5 billion in 641 companies last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Graduates of Harvard's cross-town rival, the Sloan School of  
Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, have also 
taken advantage of the Internet boom. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems to be in the air,'' said Rob Carney, a 1999 MBA  
already working with a startup called Adero that helps companies do 
business on the Internet in foreign countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a lot more people are opting to go work for smaller  
startups, maybe for the excitement and the chance to build 
something. You have the change to contribute more,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> No Help for Cotton This Year / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Cotton farmer Pat Pacheco got an eerie feeling  
when he finished planting his 1,800-acre field in Marana, Ariz., 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, maybe I should have planted wheat instead,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pacheco's worries stem from the dropping price of Arizona's top  
cash crop. Because of economic problems in Asia and a large 
surplus, prices have dropped to half what his father made for 
cotton in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
	Especially troubling for farmers like Pacheco is that for the  
first time in eight years, American cotton growers won't have 
federal dollars to help them export crops worldwide, said Wayne 
Bjorlie of the U.S. Farm Service Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The result? When Pacheco harvests his cotton this winter, he  
might not be able to compete with cheaper cotton overseas. This 
would make the surplus rise and prices slump even more. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure if we're in a crisis situation now, but there  
will be one in the future if something doesn't happen soon,'' said 
Wiley Murphy, president of the Arizona Cotton Growers Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Cotton -- one of the Arizona's five C's along with copper,  
citrus, climate and cattle -- is the state's biggest agricultural 
crop. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Arizona farmers produced 888,800 bales of cotton worth  
$286 million. Much of this has been for export to such countries as 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1991, the federal government has helped cotton farmers  
compete with lower prices in other countries by paying exporters to 
buy U.S. cotton. In 1996, Congress capped these export incentives 
to $701 million -- enough money, lawmakers thought, to last until 
2002. 
</P>
<P>
	But international cotton prices have slumped so low that the  
money ran out last December. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because we're exporting to foreign markets, every farmer is  
hurting,'' said Lloyd Brown, a spokesman for the state Department 
of Agriculture. ``There are some fruit and vegetable growers that 
are doing well, but most are doing badly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This leaves farmers with few options, Brown said. They could try  
raising pigs or planting wheat instead of cotton. But nothing is 
going to make them much more money. 
</P>
<P>
	Every Arizona cotton farm is in jeopardy, Murphy said. At 55 to  
65 cents per pound, farmers can't make enough to pay for fuel or 
finance their farms. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I'm crazy for planting cotton right now,'' said Murphy,  
who owns 600 acres of cotton fields in Marana. ``You need to get at 
least 70 cents per pound to make ends meet.'' 
</P>

	YAKIMA, Wash. (AP) -- Take me out to the ballgame, buy me some  
peanuts and Cracker Jack. 
</P>
<P>
	Or how about a DunkApple?  
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Apple Commission has signed a contract with the  
Seattle Mariners to sell DunkApples -- sliced apples served with 
tubs of caramel -- when the new Safeco Field opens in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Growers are hoping to develop sports fans as a new market for  
apples. Eventually, the commission would like to introduce 
DunkApples at stadiums around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing like it in the ball park. You're looking at  
chips, hot dogs and nachos,'' said Kevin Bredesen, the commission's 
director of food service marketing in Wenatchee. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission has been looking for ways to increase domestic  
consumption of apples, a crop getting bigger in this state. Last 
year, Washington growers harvested 100 million 43-pound boxes. 
</P>
<P>
	DunkApples will sell for $2 to $3. The contracts with the  
Mariners and the team's concessionaire, Volume Services America, 
take effect in July and extend through the 2000 season.

<HEADLINE> `Smokestacks' Rise on Wall Street / Ticker Talk  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Forget high technology for the moment -- Wall  
Street is bullish on old-fashioned smokestack America. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest bull-market surge this spring, the spotlight has  
shifted away from computers, the Internet and health-care 
innovation to more basic businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``The nation's cyclical manufacturing sector -- the companies  
that produce the nuts and bolts of the American economy such as 
paper, chemicals and primary metals -- may very well be 
rebounding,'' says Robert Kearns at the investment management firm 
of David L. Babson &AMP; Co. in Cambridge, Mass. ``The U.S. economy, 
now in its eighth year of expansive growth, may still have a good 
deal more life left in it than anyone expected only a few months 
ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody suggests that the technology boom is over, or that stock  
traders have suddenly turned nostalgic for the low-tech days of 
yore. 
</P>
<P>
	``No industry is more important to investors than technology,''  
say analysts at the investment newsletter Dow Theory Forecasts in 
Hammond, Ind. ``That fact is unlikely to change anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Still, technology shares can become overvalued. Part of what  
defines a bull market is an ability to undergo industry-group 
corrections without a major breakdown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The newsletter points out that in the Dow Jones industrial  
average's rise from 9,000 to 10,000, ``just six stocks -- IBM, 
Wal-Mart Stores, United Technologies, Merck, McDonald's, and 
General Electric -- accounted for most of the move.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But in the average's subsequent climb from 10,000 in March to  
11,000 less than two months later, more than two-thirds of the 30 
Dow components contributed, ``including double-digit gains in such 
cyclical names as Alco, AlliedSignal, International Paper, DuPont 
and Minnesota Mining,'' Dow Theory Forecasts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently the Dow Jones average of 20 transportation stocks  
joined the industrial average at a record high. Under the so-called 
Dow theory, simultaneous new highs in the two averages ``confirm'' 
that the rising trend of stock prices is intact. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are now finally indications that the U.S. manufacturing  
downturn that began in August 1997, when the Asian contagion began 
to put a damper on U.S. exports, may be on the upturn,'' ys Kearns. 
</P>
<P>
	Adds Joseph Battipaglia, investment policy chairman at the  
brokerage firm of Gruntal &AMP; Co. in New York: ``In April we saw 
renewed signs of strength in the economy and continued improvements 
in reported earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Industrial production numbers and the survey of purchasing  
managers both indicated that the sagging industrial sector may be 
nearing the end of its down cycle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As impressive as the recent show of strength by cyclical stocks  
may have been, however, many analysts question how long it will 
continue. Bullishness on the smokestack industries could quickly 
fade if the Federal Reserve shows any inclination to tighten credit 
conditions, either at this coming week's policy-setting meetings or 
sometime later in the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The markets were unsettled Friday morning when the April data on  
inflation showed a larger-than-expected 0.7 percent jump in the 
consumer price index. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Fed isn't expected to do anything dramatic on the  
basis of one monthly number, analysts note that bond-market 
interest rates have lately moved up to their highest levels in 
almost a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Federal Reserve, while impressed by low inflation, will  
obviously not sit still indefinitely if the economy keeps moving at 
this pace,'' says Richard Rippe, director of the economics research 
group at Prudential Securities.

<HEADLINE> New Treasury Heads Meets Japanese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANGKAWI, Malaysia (AP) -- For participants in the latest meeting  
between the top financial officials of Japan and the United States, 
it was business as usual despite the news that Lawrence Summers 
will soon become U.S. Treasury Secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	With the U.S. administration keen to emphasize policy continuity  
with Summers' elevation to replace Robert Rubin in Treasury's top 
job, Summers himself was at pains to present a cooperative face at 
his first bilateral meeting since Wednesday's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, a senior Japanese Finance Ministry official went out of  
his way to portray the meeting between Japanese Finance Minister 
Kiichi Miyazawa and Summers as amicable and deferential. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers ``didn't request anything specific regarding the  
Japanese economy, but rather asked Minister Miyazawa how (the 
economy) was doing, and didn't say anything else,'' the official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese financial markets had looked forward to the meeting on  
the sidelines of the finance ministers' meeting of the Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation forum to gauge whether Summers would be more 
aggressive than Rubin in calling for new stimulus measures in 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers and Miyazawa ``reviewed the situation in their  
respective economies'' and they agreed that ``Japan would continue 
its efforts to strengthen its economy and financial system until 
growth is restored and implement structural reform to enhance the 
economy's efficiency and competition,'' a spokeswoman for the U.S. 
Treasury told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers' low-key approach to the meeting with Miyazawa is more  
likely a reflection of the deputy secretary's delicate political 
standing than a sign that he is adopting a more passive tone with 
the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Senate must vote on the White House's nomination of  
Summers to the top job, and the former Harvard professor is 
unlikely to prejudice the ticklish process with any remarks that 
might be used against him. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, Summers had repeatedly said that the United States  
can't be expected to remain a single engine of growth for the 
global economy. Treasury officials are advocating that Tokyo use 
all policy tools at its disposal get the Japanese economy back on 
track.

	Bombing in Kosovo Continues  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO warplanes bombarded Kosovo  
today, and the alliance expressed increasing suspicion that Serb 
forces had deliberately trapped civilians next to a military 
command post where 87 were reported killed by allied missiles. 
Yugoslavia protested that the intensive bombing is obstructing a 
partial withdrawal of its troops from Kosovo -- a complaint NATO 
spokesman Jamie Shea dismissed. A team of 15 U.N. officials is 
preparing to tour war damage in Kosovo and meet with Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic tomorrow morning. 

</P>

	Vietnam Compares Kosovo to Itself  
</P>
<P>
	HANOI, Vietnam (AP) -- The North Vietnamese who helped build the  
Ho Chi Minh Trail, the supply-line route that kept their army 
supplied while withstanding heavy U.S. bombing, are cautioning the 
U.S. about its inablity to win in Yugoslavia. ``I think it's not a 
good idea to get involved in the Balkans,'' Maj. Gen. Do Xuan Dien 
told The Associated Press. ``Based on my 11 years of experience on 
the Ho Chi Minh Trail, you cannot win a war using only air power,'' 
Dien said. ``But if they use ground troops, they should be very 
careful because of the skills of the Serb soldiers.''

	FBI Reports Drop in Crime Last Year  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Preliminary figures from the FBI indicate a  
decline in serious crime for the seventh consecutive year, the 
Justice Department said today. Raw statistics for 1998 show a 7 
percent decline from the number of violent crimes and property 
offenses reported in 1997. Decreases were reported across the board 
in both violent crimes -- murder, rape, robbery and aggravated 
assault -- and property offenses -- burglary, larceny-theft, motor 
vehicle theft and arson, Justice officials said. Robberies fell 11 
percent and vehicle thefts dropped 10 percent from 1997 levels, 
leading the way. The number of murders declined 8 percent, while 
rape and aggravated assaults both were down by 5 percent.

	ADDA RODU SULTAN, Pakistan (AP) -- An overturned truck loaded  
with gasoline exploded in Pakistan today as dozens of people were 
collecting fuel from the leaking tanker. As many as 65 people were 
killed and at least 75 others were injured, police said. Fire 
spread rapidly through the dusty town of Adda Rodu Sultan in 
eastern Punjab province, engulfing shops and homes, and sending 
giant plumes of smoke and flames into the sky. People with their 
clothes on fire jumped into a nearby canal. It was not clear what 
sparked the explosion, police said.

	Netanyahu Faces Barak in Israel  
</P>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- The night before the election, the race for  
Prime Minister of Israel has narrowed to two candidates: 
beleaguered Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu against Ehud Barak, 
who is likely to revive peacemaking efforts with Palestinians. With 
the last two minor candidates dropping out today, the contest will 
be settled in a single ballot tomorrow. Netanyahu had hoped to push 
the race into a runoff, giving him two more weeks to campaign. The 
latest polls give Barak a solid lead. Pre-eminent pollster Hanoch 
Smith, in a survey conducted for tomorrow's newspapers, put Barak's 
lead at 8 to 10 percentage points, with a margin of error of 3 
percentage points.

	Mexico Boat Blamed in Reef Damage  
</P>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A shrimp boat whose engines stalled in bad  
weather has been blamed for damaging 1,290 square yards of coral, 
one of the worst cases of damage to Mexican reefs in recent memory. 
The boat ground through coral in shallow waters that are off-limits 
to marine traffic near the beach resort Cancun, 800 miles east of 
Mexico City, local media reported today. Environmental authorities 
were searching for the boat, whose owners may be liable for fines 
of up to $65,000 and could be forced to pay as much as $1.5 million 
to offset damage to the reef if they are found responsible.

more times off Hasek in the second period to beat Buffalo 5-3 today 
in Game 5 of their Eastern Conference semifinal series. The Sabres

the New York Knicks beat Miami 78-77 to move into the second round 
of the NBA playoffs. The Knicks became just the second 
eighth-seeded team in NBA history to defeat a No. 1 seed. They also 
may have saved the job of coach Jeff Van Gundy, who was expected to 
be fired if the Knicks lost. Instead, they'll go into the second 
round against the winner of the Detroit-Atlanta series.

<HEADLINE> Brave Act Wins Inglewood Handicap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Brave Act, rebounding from his first  
out-of-the-money finish since 1997, overtook Lord Smith midway 
through the stretch in winning Sunday's $110,700 Inglewood Handicap 
at Hollywood Park by 3 1/2 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Goncalino Almeida and carrying 120 pounds, Brave Act  
covered 1 1-16 miles on turf in 1:39 -- just two-fifths of a second 
off the course and stakes record set by Fantastic Fellow last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The 22-10 favorite, Brave Act paid $6.40, $3.40 and $2.60.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's such a nice horse to ride because he has a big heart and  
he tries very hard every time,'' Almeida said. ``At the quarter 
pole, when I asked him, he moved fast and caught (Lord Smith) very 
easily. I think this was his best race yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The win was the 10th in 20 lifetime starts for Brave Act, and  
was worth $66,420, raising the career earnings of the 5-year-old 
English-bred son of Persian Bold to $724,130. 
</P>
<P>
	It was also the 16th time Brave Act has finished either first or  
second. He was coming off a fifth-place finish in the Explosive Bid 
Handicap at Louisiana's Fair Grounds, a race won by Lord Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Lord Smith crossed the finish line 1 1/4 lengths in front of  
Expressionist in the Inglewood race and returned $4.80 and $3.20. 
</P>
<P>
	Expressionist was a half-length ahead of Such Charisma at the  
wire and paid $3.40 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	Following such Charisma across the finish line in the 59th  
running of the race for 3-year-olds and up were Commitisize, 
Bouccaneer, Martiniquais and Paxos. Fabulous Guy, Kirkwall and 
Montemiro were scratched. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Antley, who won the Preakness Stakes aboard Charasmatic in  
Baltimore on Saturday, rode two winners on Sunday's nine-race 
Hollywood Park card.

<HEADLINE> NASA Works on Anti-Vertigo System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) -- A Navy F-14 Tomcat took off and zoomed  
almost straight up, but the pilot became disoriented in a cloud and 
the jet plunged into a Nashville, Tenn., neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	The fiery 1996 crash killed three people on the ground, as well  
as the pilot and his backseat crew member. 
</P>
<P>
	The spatial disorientation, or vertigo, suffered by the pilot is  
very common and causes accidents that cost the U.S. military more 
than $300 million and about 30 lives every year, according to Capt. 
Angus Rupert of the Naval Aerospace Medical Research Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you were to experience disorientation while you were  
walking around here, you'd call a doctor,'' Rupert said. ``In the 
aviation environment, it's absolutely perfectly normal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rupert is developing for NASA a system designed to counteract  
that disorientation. In addition to crash prevention, it could give 
pilots and astronauts a new way to obtain navigation or target 
information and eventually may aid people who are blind, deaf or 
lose their sense of balance as they age, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tactile Situation Awareness System relies on the sense of  
touch, allowing pilots to figuratively fly by the seat of their 
pants. 
</P>
<P>
	Rupert has developed a vest linked to a plane's instruments, but  
a full torso suit may be the final configuration. If the plane 
leaves straight and level, the pilot feels a vibration to indicate 
which way is down. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea first came to the Canadian-born flight surgeon during a  
naked skydive in 1974 when he was a student at the University of 
Illinois. He realized he was getting a lot of sensory information 
from his bare skin, just like a bird gets from its feathers. 
</P>
<P>
	Rupert later earned a Ph.D. in neurophysiology from Illinois  
while also working on his medical degree at the University of 
Toronto, commuting in a plane he used for his skydiving school. 
</P>
<P>
	He then began touring air museums and looking for a place to do  
research. While visiting the National Museum of Naval Aviation at 
Pensacola Naval Air Station, he came across the aerospace medical 
lab and signed up. 
</P>
<P>
	Ever since, Rupert has focused on disorientation.  
</P>
<P>
	A pilot can fly perfectly well until losing sight of the  
horizon, such as at night or in clouds. The pilot's brain still 
gets balance data from the inner ear and skin-muscle-joint system, 
but it is distorted by acceleration forces. They make it feel like 
the plane is climbing when it is not. 
</P>
<P>
	That's what a Navy investigation concluded happened in  
Nashville, Rupert said. The pilot had the illusion the plane was 
still nose-up and mistakenly went into a dive thinking he was 
leveling off. The faster a plane goes the greater the illusion 
gets. 
</P>
<P>
	Instruments were invented for such situations, but they only  
help if the pilot is looking at them. A momentary distraction can 
spell trouble and the sheer number of instruments can be confusing. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to think about it, and there is the real problem,''  
Rupert said. Thinking takes time, and even split seconds can mean 
disaster. No thinking is needed for a touch-and-feel system. 
</P>
<P>
	``You put your finger in the fire, you're going to pull it  
back,'' Rupert said. ``You have this reflex that helps save you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Retired Capt. Jim Baker, a medical doctor at NASA's Johnson  
Space Center in Houston, tried Rupert's vest in 1996 when he was a 
test pilot at the Patuxent River Naval Air Test Center in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	He flew approaches, rolls and loops from the back of a plane  
with his canopy covered and all instruments removed, relying on the 
vest to tell him up from down. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very basic and very simple and very intuitive,'' Baker  
said. ``There is no learning process. You just do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Climbing in a loop, the vibrations moved up his back and then to  
his shoulders when he reached the top upside down. The vibrations 
moved down his chest while flying the back side of the loop. 
</P>
<P>
	Army helicopter pilots tested a more elaborate version about a  
year ago. Linked to a satellite navigation system and other 
instruments, the vest provided altitude, rate of movement and 
directional data through changes in the intensity and frequency, as 
well as the direction, of the vibrations. 
</P>
<P>
	Maj. Steven Gilreath, chief of flight systems for the Army  
Aeromedical Research Laboratory at Fort Rucker, Ala., said he could 
hold a hover at a fixed place and altitude without drifting and 
then fly to another spot several feet away while blindfolded. Those 
capabilities could dramatically improve safety in bad weather and 
at night, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Further modifications could alert a pilot of an enemy missile or  
plane and its direction and distance, keep them pointed at a target 
or warn they are getting too close to another aircraft, Rupert 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA is interested in it for shuttle landings, to help  
astronauts keep oriented during space walks and for a civilian 
version of the military's V-22 Osprey vertical takeoff plane. 
</P>
<P>
	The Joint Strike Fighter program also has provided some funding,  
but Rupert said getting development dollars has been a struggle 
because many in the military accept disorientation crashes as a 
cost of doing business. 
</P>
<P>
	Initially a skeptic, Gilreath has become an ally.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm trying to plug it all I can,'' he said. ``I've lost too  
many friends through the years to accidents that I think a system 
like this could have prevented.''

<HEADLINE> Alcatraz Inmates' Records Elusive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN BRUNO, Calif. (AP) -- Al Capone may have been one of  
Alcatraz's most infamous prisoners, but so little is known about 
his time there that historians aren't even sure which was his cell. 
</P>
<P>
	Just as mysterious is the fate of prison records on some of the  
most notorious criminals who did time on ``The Rock,'' the island 
prison just off San Francisco's shore. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the existing federal documents on Alcatraz are stored at  
the Pacific regional National Archives, a wealth of facts -- and 
frustration. 
</P>
<P>
	The file on George ``Machine Gun'' Kelly is missing key  
documents. Records on ``Birdman of Alcatraz'' Robert Stroud are all 
photocopies. There also are gaps in inmate files on escapes and 
virtually nothing on Capone. 
</P>
<P>
	``The records have either been purged, culled or stolen for  
people's personal gains. I'd say all of the above. They're probably 
sitting in someone's attic right now,'' says Jolene Babyak, the 
daughter of a former Alcatraz administrator, who is writing a book 
on the 1962 escape portrayed in Clint Eastwood's ``Escape From 
Alcatraz.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One theory is that records were lost when the government closed  
the prison in 1963 without any major inventory. Others speculate 
that documents may have disappeared when American Indians took over 
the island from 1969 to 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	A number of historians blame the U.S. Bureau of Prisons for  
loaning the entire collection to David Ward, a Minnesota 
criminology professor who was given the papers in the late 1970s 
for research. 
</P>
<P>
	Some say the agreement was outrageous -- and unconscionable.  
</P>
<P>
	``You've got hundreds of researchers who needed these things  
over the years,'' says Linda McGregor Scott, a Memphis, Tenn., 
author who is writing a book on ``Machine Gun'' Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of this is American history that belongs to the citizens  
of this country, and it's just not fair,'' she adds. ``It 
flabbergasts me that they would just let someone keep original 
documents for 15 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scott was so exasperated that she wrote to Janet Reno and  
lawmakers, including U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, urging them to 
look into the matter. A Feinstein aide called Scott to tell her 
they would investigate. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Ward began to gradually return the documents to the  
Bureau of Prisons, which in turn sent them to the archives in 
Northern California. Officials believe the government now has most 
of the papers, but can't be sure. 
</P>
<P>
	Ward claims if it wasn't for him there wouldn't even be an  
Alcatraz collection. He says a research clerk gathered most of the 
files from U.S. prisons after the Department of Justice 
commissioned him to investigate the inmates' post-Alcatraz lives. 
</P>
<P>
	The files were incomplete from the time he got them, Ward says.  
``There had been souvenir hunting,'' he adds. 
</P>
<P>
	Clarence Lyons of the National Archives headquarters in College  
Park, Md., would only say that the records ``should not have been 
outside of federal custody.'' Bureau of Prisons officials did not 
return phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Historians say there's no way to know if the missing papers will  
ever resurface. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 50 or so pages in Capone's file, only one relates to  
Alcatraz -- a copy of a typed Western Union message of an exchange 
between Mae Capone to warden James A. Johnston, about her husband, 
who was going insane from syphilis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Due to the rumors (I) would like to leave at once so I could  
be near my husband if anything should happen,'' Mrs. Capone wrote 
on Feb. 9, 1938, from her Florida home. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston wrote back that the gangster, imprisoned for tax  
evasion, was ``quiet, communicative, cooperative'' and ``apparently 
comprehends his condition.'' He advised Mrs. Capone to wait for 
further notice. 
</P>
<P>
	Joel Gazis-Sax, who runs an Alcatraz Web site from his Palo Alto  
home, says the Western Union document isn't as informative as it 
seems. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important, but it's second-rate,'' Gazis-Sax says. ``It  
doesn't reveal any new information on Al Capone. And it's not even 
the original document; it's a typed copy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What's missing, Gazis-Sax says, are mug shots, original  
signatures, letters, neuropsychiatric reports and warden's 
notebooks that would reveal the overall scope of Capone's life as 
seen through the eyes of his jailers. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents -- however incomplete -- offer a window into  
Alcatraz. Every inmate had a file that included court documents, 
medical, parole and disciplinary records. 
</P>
<P>
	No detail relating to prison life was deemed too insignificant  
to preserve; the archives even include a memo from a warden giving 
his permission to order smaller softballs at the prisoners' 
request. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was that arcane,'' says Babyak. ``When you see that that's  
the level of minutiae, you begin to realize that when they don't 
have any escape files, something's happened to them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for his complaining colleagues, Ward says: ``They don't know  
how lucky they are to have a collection as intact as this is. We 
did this work all so that a bunch of bozos can have it and say they 
were shortchanged, and I resent that.''

<HEADLINE> Would-Be Pols Get Clinton's Advice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- In between his pitch for a national grass-roots  
campaign to curb youth violence and his defense of NATO's 
airstrikes in Yugoslavia, President Clinton had some 
straightforward advice for aspiring politicians as he swept through 
three Western states over the weekend on a $3 million Democratic 
fund-raising tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, whenever anyone comes up to me and asks me if they  
should run for office, I always say, 'Why do you want the job?''' 
Clinton said. ``And you better be able to tell a total stranger in 
30 seconds and then have a five-minute version. 
</P>
<P>
	``And if you can't answer that question, you shouldn't run. And  
if you can, ignore the polls and run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	The end of his term may be more than a year away, but it never  
seems far from Clinton's mind. He reminisces about his first 
presidential campaign in 1992 and thanks party loyalists for 
allowing him to be ``the instrument'' of the policies that he 
credits with stoking a booming economy and reducing violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
	But he's also mindful of his critics.  
</P>
<P>
	In an upscale San Diego neighborhood around the corner from a  
fund-raiser at the home of Qualcomm chief Irwin Jacobs, a couple of 
dozen protesters waved graphic anti-abortion signs and placards 
labeling Clinton a ``traitor'' -- a reference to the campaign 
dollars the Chinese military funneled to Democrats in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was the first Democrat to carry the San Diego area since  
Harry Truman. 
</P>
<P>
	``And looking at the signs, pro and con, on the way in today, I  
would say there's still some disagreement about what ought to 
happen,'' he quipped. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the trip, the president reminded his audiences of the  
ongoing NATO campaign to halt ethnic cleansing in Kosovo and pushed 
for a national grass-roots campaign to curb youth violence in light 
of the tragedy in Littleton, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	But six events in five cities in three states over three days  
can soften the focus of a politician's spiel. And there were some 
curious asides during Clinton's talks to the various luncheon and 
dinner crowds. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday night, at a dinner in Portola Valley, Calif., Clinton  
recalled in vivid detail a Tina Turner concert in Little Rock, 
Ark., more than a decade ago. He and five friends sat in the middle 
of the front row. 
</P>
<P>
	``And behind us there was a lady I later found out was a  
hairdresser in a small town about 50 miles away, dressed in a tiger 
outfit complete with ears and tail and everything. It was an 
interesting night, all right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	There is, by necessity, a lot of repetition.  
</P>
<P>
	``I want to say again what I said yesterday and the day  
before,'' Clinton said, leading up to his pitch on youth violence 
in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	But he hit upon a solution when he spotted a famous  
impressionist in the crowd in Las Vegas. ``I'm rather 
disoriented,'' he said. ``I was wondering if maybe Rich Little 
would come and give the speech for me. We would never know the 
difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president helped the Democratic Party and candidates raise  
more than $3 million with one event in Seattle, three in California 
and two in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	The fund-raising trip followed a visit to Europe and a trip to  
Texas and Oklahoma. One indication that Clinton might be tuckered 
out: He decided to leave Las Vegas early to return to Washington 
today, scrapping plans to play a round of golf. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	It's easier to be tough with your friends when you're not  
looking them in the eye. 
</P>
<P>
	While Clinton has urged everyone to reflect on what they can do  
to avoid tragedies like the killings at Littleton's Columbine High 
School, he issued a challenge to the entertainment industry during 
his weekly radio address Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is still too much violence on our nation's screens,  
large and small,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	That evening, at a $2 million fund-raiser hosted by DreamWorks  
studio owners Steven Spielberg, David Geffen and Jeffrey Katzenberg 
and attended by some of the biggest names in Hollywood, he was less 
direct. 
</P>
<P>
	The president suggested that glorifying violence desensitizes  
some children. 
</P>
<P>
	``That doesn't make anybody who makes any movie or any video  
game or any television program a bad person or personally 
responsible for one show with a disastrous outcome,'' he was quick 
to add. ``There's no call for finger-pointing here. But we just 
look around and we know all these things go together.''

<HEADLINE> APEC Calls for Rich-Poor Dialogue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANGKAWI, Malaysia (AP) -- Pacific Rim finance ministers  
suggested on Sunday the establishment of an international body to 
study ways of improving the global financial system while reducing 
the risks associated with volatile short-term capital flows. 
</P>
<P>
	Ministers from the 21-member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation  
forum called on their deputies to study whether some rules could be 
imposed on currency traders and hedge fund operators. They were to 
present their findings to heads of state at their annual summit in 
New Zealand in September. 
</P>
<P>
	The 16-page statement fell short of calling for the regulation  
of capital markets, as demanded by host Malaysia. 
</P>
<P>
	``While we recognize that efforts to reform the international  
financial architecture will take time, we see the need for the 
momentum to be maintained, notwithstanding the recent return of 
stability to financial markets,'' the communique read. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is now greater consensus that these issues need to be  
addressed,'' Malaysia's junior finance minister, Mustapa Mohamed, 
said at a news conference closing the two-day meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Treasury Secretary-designate Lawrence Summers said the  
communique reflected several issues the United States considered 
important, including more transparency and the need for a dialogue 
between rich and poor countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am encouraged by the recognition of the importance of this  
kind of dialogue between emerging markets and developed 
economies,'' Summers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Saturday, the finance ministers have been discussing  
strategies to prevent the kind of crisis which crippled many Asian 
economies in the past two years. Ministers believe that the worst 
may be over for many of their economies, while recognizing that 
serious challenges lie ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior U.S. Treasury official, who spoke on condition of  
anonymity, said ministers focused on both the reassuring economic 
picture and upon aspects of the global financial system, ranging 
from currency regimes to capital controls. 
</P>
<P>
	Malaysia last year imposed curbs on short-term capital flight  
and a pegged exchange rate, ending offshore trading of its 
currency, the ringgit. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Malaysian Finance Minister Daim Zainuddin called on  
APEC to take up the challenge of drafting international standards 
and regulations for hedge-fund operators and currency traders, whom 
Malaysia blames for much of the Asian economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	The Group of Seven industrialized nations, through the  
Switzerland-based Bank for International Settlements, last year 
agreed to study the possible regulation of currency speculators. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States opposes restrictions on the free flow of  
capital between markets, believing curbs increase the chances of 
future crises. But more recently, it has become acutely aware of 
the dangers of unchecked hedge-fund operations because of the 
near-collapse of prominent hedge-fund Long Term Capital Management. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's minister of finance, who offered  
support to Asian economies by helping win new confidence in capital 
markets through a system of debt guarantees, has suggested that 
developing countries consider pegging their currency to a basket of 
other currencies, the U.S. official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers has previously expressed support for Japan's debt  
guarantee initiative, but indicated that Washington still has 
reservations about any kind of pegged exchange rate system. 
</P>
<P>
	Miyazawa said at the news conference that Japan intended its  
initiative to help recovering nations raise money on their own. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be able to facilitate the second stage of their  
reconstruction,'' Miyazawa said. 
</P>
<P>
	APEC comprises Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong  
Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New 
Guinea, Peru, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, 
Taiwan, Thailand, the United States and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Gore Calls for New Teacher Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAMONI, Iowa (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore called for tough new  
teacher tests, recruiting bonuses of up to $10,000 and 
``second-chance schools'' as he began Sunday to detail his agenda 
for his White House bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore used a commencement speech at Graceland College for the  
first in a series of public policy addresses he said would bring 
substance to his campaign for the Democratic nomination for 
president in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	He urged the hiring of 2.2 million new teachers, while making  
them pass tough tests, and said preschool programs should be 
extended ``for every child, in every community in America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A new ``teacher corps'' could offer youngsters up to $10,000 if  
they decide to go college to become a teacher, and a $10,000 bonus 
could await those who switch from other professions, Gore 
suggested. States would be encouraged to toughen teacher licensing. 
</P>
<P>
	Also needed are expanded after-school programs and more choices  
for parents within the public school system, the vice president 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Gore nor aides would say how much his proposals might  
cost. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is an agenda that is ambitious but responsible,'' Gore  
said. ``Every one of these proposals will be fully paid for within 
a balanced budget.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added: ``We must realize that education is the greatest  
anti-poverty program, the most powerful anti-discrimination 
strategy we could ever have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In light of the recent school shootings in Littleton, Colo.,  
Gore stressed school safety, promoting special ``second-chance'' 
programs for troubled youngsters. He also favored expanded family 
leave laws so parents could become more involved in their 
children's education. 
</P>
<P>
	Also part of his educational proposals:  
</P>
<P>
	-- More control for local school officials over staff, budget and  
student advancement. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Programs to identify ``failing schools'' and give parents more  
leeway in putting their children in different schools. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Wiring every classroom and library to the Internet and  
improving software. 
</P>
<P>
	-- New savings accounts allowing parents to save money for  
college expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, in an interview with Newsweek before the Iowa trip,  
dismissed as ``meaningless at this stage'' recent polls that 
indicate he is lagging behind possible GOP contenders such as Texas 
Gov. George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the American people really know the  
candidates,'' Gore said. ``They know me as vice president; they 
don't really know me as a candidate for president in my own 
right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also discussed President Clinton's call to The New York  
Times last week to volunteer that Gore's campaign, which many 
pundits say is off to a bumpy start, ``is in a lot better shape now 
than it was eight weeks ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Gore in the magazine interview: ``If he did not advise me  
to loosen up, he would be the only person in the United States who 
didn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what role Clinton might play in the campaign, Gore  
replied, ``He's got a full-time job being president and he's doing 
it extremely well.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Cut in Movie Gore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In California for a Hollywood bash to raise  
$2 million for Democrats, President Clinton urged the entertainment 
industry Saturday to re-evaluate the way it portrays killing in 
light of the Littleton, Colo., shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	The president asked a star-studded crowd to consider whether  
violent movies and video games don't desensitize children who 
already feel alienated from their peers and their families. 
``Desensitizing them will be more likely to push those that are 
vulnerable into destructive behavior,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That doesn't make anybody who makes any movie or any video  
game or any television program a bad person or personally 
responsible for one show with a disastrous outcome,'' he was quick 
to add. ``There's no call for finger pointing here. But we just 
look around and we know all these things go together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But in his speech and in his weekly radio address the president  
implored entertainment leaders to reflect upon their responsibility 
in molding the nation's young. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is still too much violence on our nation's screens,  
large and small,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton hopes the killings at Columbine High School will  
galvanize the public behind a national campaign against youth 
violence. As he headed to a Los Angeles dinner with some of the 
biggest names in Hollywood, Clinton challenged the entertainment 
industry to review its ratings systems and reconsider the effects 
on children of glorified screen violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every one of us has a role to play in giving our kids a safe  
future, and those with greater influence have greater 
responsibility,'' Clinton said. ``We should see movies and music, 
TV programs, video games and advertising for them made by people 
who made them as if their own children were watching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, he challenged the industry to stop showing guns in  
ads and previews children might see; to strictly enforce ratings 
systems at video stores and theaters; and to re-evaluate the 
ratings system, especially the PG rating, ``to determine whether it 
is allowing too much gratuitous violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton stopped briefly at movie mogul Lew Wasserman's home en  
route to the dinner at Greystone Mansion, an elegant, hilltop 
Gothic landmark owned by the city and often used as a set for 
movies and television programs. Among its recent credits: ``Murder 
She Wrote,'' ``Witches of Eastwick,'' ``Winds of War,'' and 
``Ghostbusters II.'' About 100 anti-war protesters waited at the 
bottom of Greystone's winding drive with placards decrying NATO's 
airstrikes in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The guest list for the event hosted by DreamWorks partners  
Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen, included Meg 
Ryan, Dennis Quaid, Goldie Hawn, Kurt Russell and Whoopi Goldberg. 
Political glitterati were headed by House Minority Leader Dick 
Gephardt and Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., criticized Clinton  
for taking money from some of the same people Lott blamed for an 
increasing laxity in morals. 
</P>
<P>
	``This weekend, the Clinton-Gore regime will be begging for cash  
from one of the polluters responsible for our nation's moral 
decline,'' he said in a statement issued by his office. ``What's 
the message to our children? Democrats care about your safety -- 
unless it's inconvenient to their partners in Hollywood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's focus on the entertainment business' influence on the  
climate of violence in America rankled some industry chiefs, and 
there was some thought that some might withdraw their support for 
Saturday's fund-raiser to benefit House and Senate Democrats in 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Party officials said no one had backed out to protest Clinton's  
remarks on violence. Not even Edgar Bronfman Jr., chief executive 
officer of the Seagram Co. Ltd., who shortly after Clinton hosted a 
White House conference on youth violence last week publicly scoffed 
at those who would link the Littleton killings to television and 
movies. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unfortunate that the American people who really look to  
their government for leadership instead get finger-pointing and 
chest-pounding,'' said Bronfman, who as the chief executive of 
Universal Studios' parent company oversees an empire that includes 
movies, music and theme parks. 
</P>
<P>
	Bronfman wasn't attending Saturday's event, but he wrote the  
party a check for an unspecified amount this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee political director  
Michael Meehan said the dinner raised ``more than $2 million'' and 
drew 135 people, none of whom expressed concern about Clinton's 
recent scolding of the entertainment industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Folks have been very supportive,'' Meehan said. ``We reached  
our goal and then some. That's the most tangible sign of support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From events in Seattle, the San Francisco Bay area and Los  
Angeles, Clinton continues Sunday to fund-raisers in San Diego and 
Las Vegas. The four-day take is expected to reach more than $3 
million for Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, who plans to visit Littleton with the first lady  
Thursday, applauded Hollywood for its voluntary ratings system for 
TV shows and the V-chip to enforce parents' decisions on what 
children may watch. 
</P>
<P>
	But still, he said, the typical American sees 40,000 dramatized  
murders by age 18. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are still too many vulnerable children who are steeped  
in this culture of violence, becoming increasingly desensitized to 
it and to its consequences and, therefore, as studies show, 
hundreds of them more liable to commit violence themselves,'' the 
president said. 
</P>
<P>
	He lashed out again at the Republican-led Senate for passing new  
gun-show restrictions that he said were ``riddled with new 
loopholes.'' ``If the Senate wants to fix the problem, it should 
fix the problem, not make it worse,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> New Prostate Treatment Unveiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- A new procedure for reducing enlarged  
prostates is less painful then surgery and doesn't require an 
overnight hospital stay, the doctor who developed it says. 
</P>
<P>
	Prostate enlargement, which is not related to cancer, requires  
surgery, medication or other treatment in one-fourth of men by age 
80, and nearly all show signs of the disorder by 85. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody's looking for an easy way to treat prostate  
(enlargement) because so many men have it,'' Dr. Joseph V. DiTrolio 
of the New Jersey Medical School in Newark, who developed the 
procedure, said last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The disorder can cause difficulty emptying the bladder because  
the swollen prostate gland constricts flow of urine through the 
urethra, around which the gland is wrapped. 
</P>
<P>
	Blocked flow of urine can damage kidneys and the bladder. In  
rare cases, it can be fatal. 
</P>
<P>
	DiTrolio said his procedure can be done in about a half hour  
with a local anesthetic, although using a small amount of 
intravenous sedative is preferable. An overnight hospital stay is 
not needed. 
</P>
<P>
	The procedure is done with a device DiTrolio patented called an  
InjecTx that is threaded through the urethra to inject small 
amounts of purified alcohol into the prostate. The alcohol causes 
cells to take in too much water and die, thus shrinking the 
prostate. 
</P>
<P>
	The procedure requires the patient to be catheterized for two  
days, compared to the seven typical for those who choose surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	DiTrolio presented results of his first 10 cases at the American  
Urological Association's annual meeting in Dallas earlier this 
month. The procedure reduced the prostate, without side effects, in 
nine of 10 patients who received it, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Patients were only followed for six months, so future research  
is needed to study long-term effects. 
</P>
<P>
	This month, a dozen hospitals and medical clinics begin testing  
the procedure on about 12 patients each, and more sites may be 
added. DiTrolio plans to begin selling his device to urologists in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. John McConell, chairman of urology at University of Texas  
Southwestern Medical School in Dallas and the head of a panel 
drafting new guidelines for treating the disorder, said there is 
some danger that nearby organs could be damaged if the alcohol 
misses its target. 
</P>
<P>
	But he praised DiTrolio for doing the study, noting he could  
have begun selling the device without further testing because the 
Food and Drug Administration has already approved use of alcohol in 
the body and each component of the new device. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no treatment that has zero risk,'' McConnell said.

<HEADLINE> Brokaw: Technology Let People Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- Tom Brokaw thinks technology has let  
people down, saying it has left an ``ugly scar on the face of 
history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``An ideology designed to empower the masses became one of the  
most ruthless instruments of oppression,'' Brokaw told graduates 
during commencement at the College of Santa Fe on Saturday. ``It is 
not enough to wire the world if you short-circuit the soul. 
Technology without heart is not enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brokaw, anchorman of ``NBC Nightly News,'' also urged graduates  
to ``hate hate, become color blind and take care of each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The author of the recent best seller ``The Greatest  
Generation,'' said that's what Americans who lived through the 
Depression and World War II fought for. 
</P>
<P>
	But now ``we have political leaders too eager to divide for  
their selfish aims rather than unify,'' Brokaw said. ``We have a 
mass media much too inclined to exploit those instincts. I wonder 
if this is what the `Greatest Generation' made all those sacrifices 
for?''

<HEADLINE> Sixers Coach To Face His Former Team  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- It'll be reunion time at Market Square Arena  
when Philadelphia coach Larry Brown sends his 76ers against the 
Indiana Pacers, the team he helped build into a title contender. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is my worst nightmare, playing them,'' Brown said.  
</P>
<P>
	Under Brown's leadership from 1993-97, the Pacers were  
transformed from an also-ran into a club that reached Game 7 of the 
conference finals in three of the past five years -- including 
Brown's first two years as Pacers coach. 
</P>
<P>
	But Brown resigned following a tumultuous fourth season in which  
the Pacers failed to reach the playoffs and finished 39-43. 
</P>
<P>
	``I messed up in my last year there,'' Brown said after the  
76ers won their opening round series with Orlando on Saturday. 
``Somewhere along the line, I hope I can make up for that with 
those guys. I respect everything about them. I respect what they've 
done and what they've meant for the league. I'm looking forward to 
this because I am a competitor, but it's going to be hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Game 1 in the best-of-7 series is Monday night at Market Square  
Arena, where Indiana has won its last 10 playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams can expect to play before enthusiastic fans. Indiana  
fans were an inspiration as the Pacers defeated Milwaukee in the 
opening round. And Philadelphia's fans turned the First Union 
Center into a loud, unfriendly environment for the Magic. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sixers, in the playoffs for the first time since 1991, will  
take a 10-game home court winning streak dating back to the end of 
the regular season into Game 3 of this series. 
</P>
<P>
	``This year, it is the toughest place to play,'' Orlando's Penny  
Hardaway said after the Magic were eliminated. ``The city was very 
excited, and they felt a great vibe from the team. ... This is the 
toughest and the loudest crowd that I've played against this 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Bird, who inherited the nucleus of his team from Brown,  
led it to a franchise-record 58 regular season victories and 
another trip to the conference finals his first year as coach. He 
tried Sunday to downplay the significance of Brown in the series. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a job to do. We're playing Philadelphia, which is a  
very solid basketball team. We'll go about our business, as 
always,'' Bird said. ``We always say home court is very important 
to us, and we want to take care of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly everyone on the Pacers played for Brown -- Reggie Miller,  
Rik Smits, Mark Jackson, Dale Davis, Antonio Davis, Derrick McKey 
and Jalen Rose. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a great coach,'' Jackson said of Brown, who played for  
Brown with the Los Angeles Clippers as well as the Pacers. 
``Everywhere he's been, he's won. For some reason it didn't work 
the final year (here). It just didn't work. That's as far as you 
can go with it. ... I just think it ran its course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I pushed too hard with some guys,'' Brown said. ``I wasn't  
patient enough with some guys. I expected things that they weren't 
capable of doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rose, who averaged 15.7 points as a reserve in three games  
against his former coach this season, spent much of Brown's last 
season with the Pacers on the bench, averaging a career-low 7.3 
points in a career-low 1,188 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're approaching this as business as usual. Everyone knows  
Larry Brown is returning to face his old team,'' Rose said. ``We 
can't really get caught up into that. We've got to go out and play, 
try to find a way to win a championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson said the Pacers are playing a strong Philadelphia team  
with a ``superstar'' in league-scoring leader Allen Iverson. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just another team that is in our way for us to accomplish  
our ultimate goal, which is to win the whole thing,'' Jackson said. 
``It doesn't make any sense pointing fingers, or saying anything 
special. The thing that is special is the opportunity for us to win 
the whole thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 76ers won the season-series 2-1, with Iverson averaging 32.7  
points in the three games. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can do a lot of things. He's a phenomenal scorer with  
tremendous heart and desire. I don't think you stop him with one 
guy. You have to do it collectively,'' Jackson said. ``You're not 
going to stop him. You want to contain him, you want to challenge 
him, you don't want him to get anything easy.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A new way of delivering chemotherapy appears to  
substantially improve the survival of people being treated for 
colon and rectal cancer that has spread to the liver. 
</P>
<P>
	The treatment involves injecting standard chemotherapy drugs  
directly into the hepatic artery, which supplies blood to the 
liver, rather than the usual method of putting the drugs into a 
vein. 
</P>
<P>
	About 138,000 new cases of colon and rectal cancer are diagnosed  
in the United States annually. Eventually, the disease spreads to 
the liver in about 60 percent of these people, and the outlook is 
grim. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Nancy Kemeny and colleagues from Memorial Sloan-Kettering  
Cancer Center in New York City tested the new way of giving 
chemotherapy in 156 patients. After surgery to remove the cancer 
from the liver, they were randomly assigned to get standard 
chemotherapy or the hepatic artery approach. 
</P>
<P>
	After two years, 85 percent of those getting arterial  
chemotherapy were still alive, compared with 69 percent receiving 
the drugs through a vein. Whether this will eventually translate 
into longer survival is unknown. However, Kemeny said projections 
suggest that 60 percent of those getting the arterial treatment 
will still be alive after five years, compared with 40 percent 
getting standard treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Kemeny presented the results Sunday at a meeting in Atlanta of  
the American Society of Clinical Oncology. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very elegant study and an important one,'' said Dr.  
Derek Raghaven of the University of Southern California. ``This is 
progress.''

<HEADLINE> Mia Hamm Ties Soccer Scoring Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Mia Hamm tied the international scoring record  
Sunday, getting her 107th goal in the U.S. women's game against the 
Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamm, playing in her 171st game with the national team, scored  
in the 53rd minute of this exhibition leading to next month's 
Women's World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal ties Hamm with Italy's Elisabetta Vignotto, who is  
retired. It was Hamm's third career goal against the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
	She took a cross from Cindy Parlow and dribbled between two  
defenders before scoring with her left foot. The shot hit the 
crossbar and dropped in, giving the United States a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamm raised her right arm as the crowd roared, and then jumped  
and pumped her right fist. The ball was retrieved, marked with 107 
and saved for Hamm.

	Serb POWs May Be Freed Soon  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The two Serb soldiers held as prisoners of war  
by U.S. military authorities in Germany will be released, possibly 
tomorrow, a senior Pentagon official said today. ``They are going 
to be released,'' the official said, speaking on condition of 
anonymity. ``We're just working out the details now.'' Defense 
Secretary William Cohen strongly hinted a few weeks ago that there 
was a good possibility the prisoners would be released, but there 
has been little word on their fate since then. The pending release 
of the Serb soldiers comes after the release earlier this month of 
three U.S. Army soldiers captured along the Kosovo-Macedonia 
border.

	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- As NATO warplanes continue  
bombarding Kosovo today, the Yugoslav army took control of border 
crossings out of Montenegro, Yugoslavia's junior republic. 
Residents in Montenegro have feared a Belgrade-led action against 
the republic's government, which has followed a pro-Western policy. 
Montenegrin officials said federal troops stopped Kosovo refugees 
trying to leave Montenegro for Albania. Soldiers separated men from 
the group and took them away, officials said.

	FBI Reports Drop in Crime Last Year  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- There was a decline in serious crime for the  
seventh year in a row according to 1998's preliminary figures from 
the FBI, the Justice Department said today. Raw statistics for 1998 
show a 7 percent decline from the number of violent crimes and 
property offenses reported in 1997. Decreases were reported across 
the board in both violent crimes -- murder, rape, robbery and 
aggravated assault -- and property offenses -- burglary, 
larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft and arson, Justice officials 
said. The number of murders declined 8 percent, while rape and 
aggravated assaults both were down by 5 percent.

	ADDA RODU SULTAN, Pakistan (AP) -- An overturned truck loaded  
with gasoline exploded in Pakistan today as dozens of people were 
collecting fuel from the leaking tanker. As many as 65 people were 
killed and at least 75 others were injured, police said. Fire 
spread rapidly through the dusty town of Adda Rodu Sultan in 
eastern Punjab province, engulfing shops and homes, and sending 
giant plumes of smoke and flames into the sky. People with their 
clothes on fire jumped into a nearby canal. It was not clear what

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Fourteen of the 30 major league baseball teams  
posted operating losses last year, Forbes magazine reported today. 
The Los Angeles Dodgers lost money -- $11.7 million on an estimated 
$108 million in revenue -- in large part because of baseball's 
revenue-sharing system, which has baseball's top 13 
revenue-generating teams contributing $100 million to the 15 teams 
with the lowest revenues. That didn't stop the New York Yankees, 
which had to pay $13 million in revenue sharing, maintaining a 
value of $491 million, the best in baseball.

<HEADLINE> U S West, Global Crossing To Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Baby Bell phone company U S West Inc. has  
reached an agreement to merge with growing telecommunications 
company Global Crossing Ltd., according to a source close to the 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, which will be announced Monday morning, U S West  
will purchase 9.5 percent of Global Crossing for roughly $2.4 
billion, the source said. The two companies will subsequently merge 
in a 50-50 stock combination, creating a company with $17 billion 
in annual revenue and a stock market value of $65 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined company, which would keep the Global Crossing name,  
would have two separate stocks: one to track the performance of the 
high-growth Internet and data assets, the other stock for the 
traditional telephone assets. Investors will be able to choose 
which stock they want to hold, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Annuziata, Global Crossing's chief executive officer,  
will share the power and the top title of the new company with 
Solomon Trujillo, chief executive of U S West, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West, based in Denver, has local phone customers in 14  
Western and Midwestern states, a wireless phone service, and offers 
high-speed Internet access. It had $12.4 billion in revenue in 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Global Crossing, headquartered in Bermuda, offers local and  
long-distance phone service and has a vast undersea fiber optic 
cable network. Though it had only $424 million in revenue in 1998, 
Global Crossing has been on a buying spree recently. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, it agreed to pay $725 million in cash for the undersea  
cable operations of the British telecommunications company Cable &AMP; 
Wireless. In March, Global Crossing signed a contract to acquire 
Frontier Corp., a phone company based in Rochester, N.Y., for about 
$11 billion in stock. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, investors bid up the price of U S West shares by  
$2.25 to $62.25 amid a broad selloff on the New York Stock 
Exchange. Global Crossing's Nasdaq-listed stock was up $1.37 1/2 cents 
at $61.37 1/2

	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Jeff Cunningham had a goal and an assist  
as the Columbus Crew beat the New England Revolution 2-0 Saturday 
night in the inaugural game in the first stadium built specifically 
for major professional soccer in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham scored his third goal of the season 10 minutes into  
the game. Stern John scored the second goal in the 59th minute on a 
header from five yards off a cross into the box by Cunningham. Matt 
Kmosko also assisted on the play. 
</P>
<P>
	John set up the first goal in the $28.5 million stadium by  
stealing the ball at midfield and sending a pass to Cunningham who 
chested the ball down and made a quick turning shot from 12 yards 
out past the onrushing Walter Zenga. 
</P>
<P>
	An overflow crowd of 24,741 packed the most ambitious soccer  
facility built in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	One of New England's best chances came in the 26th minute when  
Paulo Dos Santos collected a ball that Crew goalkeeper Mark 
Dougherty punched away on a corner kick. But Dougherty was able to 
pull in Santos' shot from 30 yards out. 
</P>
<P>
	One minute later, Johnny Torrez sent a hard shot from 18 yards  
out that Dougherty was able to save.

<HEADLINE> Britain: Serbs Using Human Shields </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Britain said Sunday it did not yet know why ethnic  
Albanian civilians were in a Kosovo village attacked by NATO, but 
that Serb police reportedly herded them there from their hiding 
places in the hills. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Thursday's attack on Korisa, which killed 87 civilians,  
NATO has suggested that they were used as human shields but has 
been unable to confirm that. 
</P>
<P>
	British Ministry of Defense spokesman John Spellar told  
reporters on Sunday that Korisa was a legitimate military target. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe it was being used as a military camp and command  
post with military vehicles and artillery present,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not yet know the reason why civilians were at this  
location at the time of the attack. But it increasingly appears 
likely, however, that the civilians were used as human shields. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're aware of continued reports that according to survivors,  
the civilians were ordered by Serb police to return to the village 
from the hills where they'd been hiding for several weeks,'' 
Spellar said. ``On their return they were not permitted to live in 
their homes, instead they were herded into concentrated areas 
within the village and held there until the NATO attack took 
place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said in Brussels that the forces of  
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic used human shields. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know that we're up against an adversary who has no scruples  
when it comes to using civilians as human shields,'' Shea said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Human shields are a factor, but they're not obviously going to  
stop us continue this air operation,'' Shea said, adding, ``we will 
never, never intentionally target civilians.''

<HEADLINE> Inmate Paralyzed by Guard Paid $2M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The state has agreed to pay $2.2 million to  
an inmate paralyzed by a guard's bullet during a fight at Corcoran 
State Prison, the Los Angeles Times reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Department of Corrections admitted no wrongdoing in the  
settlement reached this month, according to the newspaper report. 
</P>
<P>
	Vincent Tulumis, 33, was shot in the neck during a May 1993  
fight allegedly set up by a guard, and neither fighting inmate was 
armed or posing a serious threat to the other when the shot was 
fired, according to depositions in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was clearly in the best interests of the state to see if a  
settlement could be made short of continued litigation,'' Cal 
Terhune, state corrections director, told the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Tulumis was serving a three-year sentence for drug possession  
and was nine months shy of his release at the time of the shooting. 
Paralyzed from the neck down, Tulimis said the settlement doesn't 
compensate all he's lost. 
</P>
<P>
	Tulumis said the fight was instigated by two guards, echoing  
claims by others inmates. From 1989 to 1995, seven inmates were 
killed and 43 were wounded by guards firing assault rifles to stop 
inmate fights at Corcoran, the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the Corrections Department requested more than $91  
million in additional funds from the Legislature to cover a deficit 
partly due to unforeseen legal costs associated with brutality 
cases and inmate medical costs.

<HEADLINE> Search Ongoing for Fugitive Killers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTEZUMA CREEK, Utah (AP) -- Oliver Coho has never met Alan  
Lamont Pilon or Jason Wayne McVean, but he knows plenty about them. 
</P>
<P>
	For the better part of a year, the Navajo policeman has been  
tracking the two accused killers of a Cortez, Colo., officer 
through the canyons, creek beds and caves of southeastern Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	Coho knows Pilon wears military boots -- size 13 wide. He knows  
both men got new boots last year when they learned they were being 
tracked. He knows one smokes Marlboro Lights. And he knows McVean 
drinks too much. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't seen them, but we know they're still there,'' Coho  
says, his face sun-bronzed from his excursions into the wilderness. 
The clues tell him so. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Officer Dale Claxton was on routine patrol May 29, 1998, when he  
stumbled upon three men in a stolen water truck on a bridge 
southeast of Cortez. They opened fire with automatic weapons, 
hitting Claxton and his cruiser 26 times before he could even 
unbuckle his seatbelt. 
</P>
<P>
	In the ensuing chase and shootout, two Montezuma County  
sheriff's deputies were wounded. Suspect Robert Mason was found 
dead of a self-inflicted gunshot days later some 55 miles away near 
Bluff, Utah, after he wounded a San Juan County, Utah, deputy. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities had almost immediately identified the suspects in  
Claxton's killing as McVean, Pilon and Mason and learned all three 
were survivalists. The two surviving suspects eluded a huge search 
in early June through parts of Colorado and Utah. At the height of 
the nine-day search, more than 500 searchers from 51 agencies 
joined the effort, including the FBI, police and sheriff's deputies 
on horseback and in helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
	Searches of the men's homes turned up literature protesting  
tactics used by the Internal Revenue Service. Police Chief Roy Lane 
says Cortez, although hundreds of miles from the nearest seat of 
government, is a haven for anti-government groups -- ``people who 
don't like taxes, who won't put license plates on their cars, who 
don't believe in drivers' licenses. But we've never had any 
violence before,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Police also found maps with circles, indicating caves along  
Montezuma Creek, places to hide out and stash food. Police learned 
the suspects had been going into the area for two or three years, 
with only enough food for a week. 
</P>
<P>
	``They aren't novices. They know what they're doing,'' Lane  
says. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The memorial on the bridge is simple. ``Officer Dale Claxton.  
Lobo 11 (his police call sign). May 29, 1998.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An evergreen planted nearby is hung with bows and a rosary. A  
white cross marks the spot. A toy bunny in a basket reminds people 
of the four children and widow he left behind. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, more than $40,000 has been raised to help Sue Claxton  
pay off her $86,000 mortgage, and she still drops by the police 
department. 
</P>
<P>
	``She knows we still consider her family,'' Lane says.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	More than 20 sightings of the two suspects have been reported  
over the year, and police have responded to each one. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, Coho shouldered his backpack -- loaded with fruit,  
sandwiches, plenty of water and his guns -- and walked 4 miles 
through the snow after yet another sighting. 
</P>
<P>
	Coho grew up in Ramah, N.M., and learned his tracking skills  
herding sheep. The rolling scrub, hills and washes where he lives 
in a trailer about 45 miles west of Cortez reminds him a lot of 
where he grew up. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's rugged and there are a lot of caves here,'' he says.  
</P>
<P>
	Coho also knows the area north of town where the two men are  
believed to have spent the winter. For five years, he has gone 
there for firewood. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen the places they walked. I've seen their  
footprints,'' he says. The fact that those footprints changed last 
October -- with a swap in the distinctive treads of the military 
boots Pilon wears -- tells him they're getting help from the 
outside. 
</P>
<P>
	He has found scattered cigarette butts and mounds of empty beer  
cans along river banks. Others in the Navajo nation have reported 
unfamiliar vehicles, and one man recently said he saw Pilon and 
McVean in a group of men drinking beer. 
</P>
<P>
	Coho knows he's getting close. Two months ago two men in a van,  
believed to be associates of the suspects, threatened a girl whose 
picture had appeared in the local newspaper after she reported 
seeing Pilon and McVean. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know they're here,'' Coho says softly.  
</P>
<P>
	Others aren't so sure. Some believe the pair died trying to  
hide. Others think they fled to hole up in Montana or Idaho with 
anti-government sympathizers. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	George Cuckie, 41, a construction worker who says he moved to  
Cortez to escape Denver's rat race, said there were a lot of 
antigovernment sympathizers around Cortez who could help the 
fugitives. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's inconceivable those two men could stay out that long  
without some outside help. A lot of the sightings are probably 
pranks to keep law enforcement officers off track,'' he suggests. 
</P>
<P>
	Lane is also convinced the two men are still in caves around  
Cortez and vows they will be captured eventually. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no doubt in my mind they're getting help,'' he says.  
``They can go without food for a while, but they had to get dry 
shoes. They had help to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lane sees parallels between McVean and Pilon and fugitive Eric  
Rudolph, accused in three bombings in Atlanta and one in 
Birmingham, Ala., but able to evade authorities in the rugged 
mountains of North Carolina for the last 16 months. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're going to see more people doing this to avoid  
arrest,'' Lane says. ``Rudolph has succeeded. McVean and Pilon have 
succeeded. There will be others who think they can elude the 
police. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll get them at some point. They're the ones living in the  
elements. It's easier for us to wait them out than for them to wait 
us out.''

<HEADLINE> Portrait of Clockmaker Peter Burke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILLIPSBURG, N.J. (AP) -- Peter Burke kneels and offers a silent  
prayer before beginning another ascent. 
</P>
<P>
	Three wooden ladders take him from the serene, stained-glass  
interior of the 19th century church, up into the building's clock 
tower -- a place of chipping plaster, cooing pigeons and pungent 
machinery oil. 
</P>
<P>
	The clockmaker has spent countless hours in the tower over the  
last 4 1/2 years, working on the chimes and the timepiece with 6-foot 
faces. He dismantles pieces and hauls them home for repair, tinkers 
with motors and builds replacements for those that can't be fixed. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the biggest project he has ever undertaken. Except for an  
occasional payment for some machine parts, he is doing it gratis. 
And mostly in solitude. 
</P>
<P>
	Why? Burke, now 39, says it is a combination of his life's  
calling, a sinful past, a discovery of God. 
</P>
<P>
	A brass plate on the machine that runs the clock -- Burke calls  
it the ``brain'' -- says the clock was completed Nov. 5, 1910. It is 
Seth Thomas No. 1645, or the 45th in a series of its type. 
</P>
<P>
	The year 1910 marked the 50th anniversary of St. Philips and St.  
James' first Mass and the 25th for its edifice on South Main 
Street. The 109-foot spire, white above the red brick clock tower, 
was built to commemorate the occasions. 
</P>
<P>
	No one seems to remember when the clock stopped working. In the  
1960s, during the Delaware River community's centennial, a 
newspaper called the still-chiming timepiece one that ``watches 
over a town.'' Monsignor Michael Corona says residents in this 
former railroad town used to set their watches to the clock. 
</P>
<P>
	Clock tower legends abound. There's the man who plunged to his  
death while building the tower. And the pastor who didn't 
appreciate being awakened early by the chimes. Burke doesn't know 
what's true. He does say wires lifting the hammers that strike the 
1,000-pound bell appear to have been purposely destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	The clock was built with four faces so residents could tell time  
from any direction. Originally it was wound by hand. The motor came 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	It struck the hour and three times daily for the Angelus, a  
Catholic tradition traced to a 14th century pope who requested that 
bells be rung as an invitation to prayer. The Angelus strikes at 6 
a.m., noon and 6 p.m. -- three strokes, three times, with a pause 
after every third stroke, then nine strokes without a pause. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Angel of the Lord declared unto Mary ... '' Burke recites,  
then explains, ``It's the incarnation of Christ's invocation, 
incorporated into the clock. It represents the angel and our 
responsibility to the message that the angel brought.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's a prayer he knows by heart, and one he recites whether he's  
working on the clock or not. 
</P>
<P>
	Burke learned about the broken clock five years ago from his  
wife, who'd heard about it from a fellow parishioner. 
</P>
<P>
	Bats, pigeons, grease-clogged parts and water damage greeted  
Burke. An arm that helps move the dials had been repaired with a 
coffee can. And motor oil, not special clock oil, had been used to 
maintain it. 
</P>
<P>
	With the help of a contractor friend, Burke cleaned up the place  
and installed lighting, heating and pulleys to hoist parts and 
tools. Then came the task of figuring out what was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of it's new to me. Eventually, I'll figure it out. I talk  
to other people in my trade. There's very few that do work on tower 
clocks,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like working on a watch, sitting on a bench. You have  
to be young and in good shape ... and willing to get dirty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1980s, Burke attended a clock-making school in New  
York and apprenticed with a watchmaker at a jewelry store. After a 
stint at another jewelry store, he landed a job with Tag Heuer at 
the Swiss company's U.S. headquarters in Springfield. He has worked 
there, the world's third largest watch company, for nearly a 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one of Burke's three weeks of paid vacation is devoted  
to working on the clock, as are some weekends and holidays. 
Donations have enabled the church to pay a few thousand dollars for 
parts and machinery, but most of the work is labor-intensive. 
</P>
<P>
	Burke dismantled pieces, cut the grease in cleaning tanks at a  
shop in his home and rebuilt and repainted. 
</P>
<P>
	The clockwork is nearly complete. The chimes are next. He has no  
firm deadline but hopes it will chime in time for the millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll just thank God that He allows me to finish this,'' he  
says, stroking a piece made to look like a cross. ``I figured 
that's who this is for: God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burke has leaned heavily on the church throughout his life. He  
admits ``a lot of sin and misunderstanding,'' but declines to 
elaborate. He joined the parish of when he moved here 11 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	But he says he ``hooked into the church'' more recently --  
actually around the same time he learned of the broken clock. With 
a teacher at his daughter's Catholic school, Burke started reading 
and discussing religious scriptures and parables. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was getting deeper into prayer,'' he remembers. ``Finally, I  
went to confession five years ago, and I just needed to go over my 
whole life. It was like a great weight lifted off from me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He considers his ability to repair clocks a gift from God that  
now he can give back. ``I make that my prayer, my work, so I want 
to do the best work I can do,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want someone to walk down the street and say, `Oh look,  
the clock's working.' They don't need to know who did it or how it 
happened.''

<HEADLINE> Tim Hardaway Fizzles in Game Five </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- When Tim Hardaway's last-second shot swished to end  
the first half, he jumped for joy and punched the air with his 
fist. 
</P>
<P>
	That was Hardaway's last basket, and his last celebration.  
</P>
<P>
	The Miami Heat's struggling star went scoreless in the second  
half, a goose egg that loomed large in the New York Knicks' 78-77 
victory Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway's series-long shooting slump appeared to be in the past  
when he made his first two attempts. He had nine points at 
halftime, including the buzzer-beater from 22 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hardaway took just two shots in the second half and missed  
them both. Worse, his turnover with 20 seconds left gave the Knicks 
the ball, and they took advantage when Allan Houston hit the 
game-winner with 0.8 seconds left to win the series 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
	``I put a lot on my shoulders,'' Hardaway said. ``I wasn't able  
to produce the whole series, and I turned it over in the last 30 
seconds and cost us the ballgame.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway went 4-for-10 to end the series 15-for-56 (27 percent).  
He went 0-for-3 from 3-point range to finish 5-for-25 (20 percent). 
</P>
<P>
	Teammates defended Hardaway's lack of offense.  
</P>
<P>
	``Timmy is not at fault,'' Alonzo Mourning said. ``Collectively  
we made mistakes. Anyone who blames Tim is full of bull.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But in such a close series, it's clear the Heat needed Hardaway  
at his best. He averaged 17.4 points per game this season and 
barely half that -- 9.0 -- in the series. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, Hardaway scored 38 points to lead the Heat to a  
Game 7 victory over New York. There were no such heroics in this 
year's winner-take-all showdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the lowest,'' Hardaway said. ``It hurts.''  
</P>
<P>
	A collision in February with Grant Hill left Hardaway with a  
bruise and hyperextension below his right knee. Before the series 
he complained that the injury still bothers him; more recently he 
refused to discuss it. 
</P>
<P>
	At any rate, the 32-year-old Hardaway looked older than his age  
for most of the series. And without his shot, the Heat simply 
didn't have enough scoring punch. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Porter, Voshon Lenard and Clarence Weatherspoon -- who  
played pivotal roles in Miami's Game 4 win -- shot a combined 
3-for-15 Sunday and totaled just 12 points. Starting guard Dan 
Majerle had three points and scored 20 in the series. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway, meanwhile, never got hot.  
</P>
<P>
	``The shots I took, I missed,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	He was speaking of the second half, but he could have been  
talking about the entire series.

<HEADLINE> Gonzalez Extends Hit Streak to 28 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Arizona's Luis Gonzalez extended his club-record  
hitting streak to 28 games Sunday with a first-inning double off 
Pedro Astacio. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez, who has hit safely in 32 of 33 games this season,  
blooped a 2-0 pitch off the end of his bat that fell just in front 
of a sliding Larry Walker in right field. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez tied Marquis Grissom for the second-longest hitting  
streak in the NL this decade. Grissom hit safely in 28 straight 
games for the Atlanta Braves in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Hal Morris had a 29-game hitting streak for the Cincinnati Reds  
in 1996, the longest such streak this decade. Pete Rose set the NL 
mark in 1978 with a 44-game hitting streak. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston's Nomar Garciaparra and Cleveland's Sandy Alomar had  
30-game hitting streaks in 1997 and Eric Davis hit safely in 30 
consecutive games for Baltimore last season.

<HEADLINE> Lockhart Friendly, but Tough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Joe Lockhart looked like a whipless ringmaster  
among the circus lions, sitting at his desk feigning naivete for 
the swarm of reporters buzzing about efforts in Moscow to oust 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why are you asking me about impeachment?'' Lockhart teased.  
``Do I have some special knowledge or experience on this?'' 
</P>
<P>
	What Lockhart did have was the ability to speak for a president  
who himself has been impeached. But no words were forthcoming. The 
reporters got only more teasing. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not personal, it's just Lockhart's way. After seven months  
on the job, President Clinton's press secretary has proved a blend 
of pugnacity and insouciance, very much the ``Cool Joe, Mean Joe 
(Killer Joe)'' in composer Quincy Jones' jazzy ode to a smooth 
operator. 
</P>
<P>
	When he's Cool Joe, Lockhart chums up reporters on airport  
tarmacs or backstage at Clinton speeches, benign and friendly. When 
he's Mean Joe, he calls those same reporters and fights via 
telephone -- even climbing the ranks to their editors -- if he thinks 
they have wronged his boss. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think people should ever be in any doubt over where I  
stand,'' Lockhart said in an interview. ``When the argument over 
any issue is done, the people who know me wipe the slate, and we 
start again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Take the time Lockhart learned that news organizations were  
following up on rumors the president and first lady were 
considering a trial separation after a spat during their February 
ski trip. It posed a problem for Clinton because the first lady did 
not accompany him on his Central American tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Standing somewhere in Guatemala, Lockhart grabbed a cellphone  
and called an Associated Press reporter in Washington. ``Oh, so now 
we're going to have a story based on some guy's fantasy? That's 
ridiculous,'' he complained. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there was the day in early March when Lockhart swore he did  
not watch Monica Lewinsky's TV interview on ABC the night before, 
and asked innocently, ``Is it worth watching?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Not really,'' deadpanned Sam Donaldson, ABC's White House  
correspondent. ``She's rather pathetic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You heard it here, folks, and not from me!'' Lockhart declared  
with a gleam in his eye. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus Lockhart dodged the more pressing question: Whether Clinton  
watched the interview as he lingered for 34 minutes aboard a parked 
Air Force One, meeting, Lockhart explained, with some congressmen. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who pushed Cool Joe got Mean Joe, who tersely replied, ``I  
said he did NOT watch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	These days, Lockhart is mostly Cool Joe. The president is in the  
throes of the NATO mission in Yugoslavia, and this means Lockhart 
repeats vague explanations about the military operation, sprinkling 
in touches of mock pique when questions move beyond where he wants 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart spent many earlier days as Mean Joe, slugging it out  
with a press corps irritated by Clinton's silence on impeachment. 
At one point, a reporter complained of ``non-existent'' access to 
the president and Lockhart accused the reporter of trying to 
embarrass him. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart returned the next day as Contrite Joe, and said White  
House chief of staff John Podesta suggested he give a name to the 
evil twin who had popped out before the cameras. 
</P>
<P>
	He solicited names from reporters before coming up with his own  
-- ``Lester'' -- but none of them call Lockhart that. They just call 
him Joe with a mood qualifier: Nice. Mean. Happy. Easy. 
</P>
<P>
	``One on one, he's charming and funny and has a great sense of  
humor,'' said Ann Scales, White House correspondent for The Boston 
Globe. ``It's obvious he has a command of the subjects and does his 
homework. But he also has a bully-like quality, where you know, 
'Hey, he's not having a good day.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said he fought for respect in those early months,  
looking to conquer the ``substitute teacher'' syndrome he was 
seeing from reporters who he felt viewed him as a kid brother-like 
deputy to his suave predecessor, Mike McCurry. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was the deputy and I'd get up to brief occasionally, I  
had to stand there and take spitballs,'' Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	In his briefings, not even average citizens escape Lockhart's  
humor. 
</P>
<P>
	``To my C-SPAN viewers: Those of you who don't like me, please  
stop writing. I am very thin-skinned, and it really gets to me,'' 
Lockhart said last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guarantees about 300 next week,'' he grinned.

<HEADLINE> Phase 1 of Nuke Cleanup Nears End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST VALLEY, N.Y. (AP) -- More than 600,000 gallons of highly  
radioactive waste have been solidified into glass, nearly 
completing the first phase of a cleanup at what was once the 
country's only commercial reprocessing center for nuclear fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	The lethal leftovers from three decades ago are now in the form  
of 10-foot glass logs stored in individual steel canisters and 
stacked behind concrete walls 4 feet thick. The 250 capsules are 
visible through equally thick windows but are touched only by 
robotic arms. They will endure for 10,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you hugged one of these things you wouldn't last a  
minute,'' said Terry Dunford, spokesman for the West Valley 
Demonstration Project, peering through a mineral oil-filled window 
that gives the storage room an eerie yellow hue. 
</P>
<P>
	The containers are destined, someday, for a repository that does  
not yet exist, perhaps Nevada's Yucca Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
	As painstaking and technologically challenging as the three-year  
$1.3 billion waste-to-glass process has been -- using 
remote-controlled equipment to do everything from mix the glass to 
stack the canisters -- the hardest part of the West Valley cleanup 
is yet to come. 
</P>
<P>
	Next, it must be decided what to do with the 3,300-acre site  
itself, situated deep in farmland in western New York, 40 miles 
south of Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	Four options now on the table include indefinitely monitoring  
and maintaining the site at a cost of $30 million per year, to 
removing all traces of the project and its waste, at a cost of $8 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The other options: store all waste and residual contamination in  
an above-ground facility, at a cost of $3.7 billion, or fill the 
tank and other underground facilities with concrete and cap the 
site, at a cost of roughly $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson has given state and  
federal authorities one year to agree on how to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's at a crossroads right now,'' said James Little, executive  
vice president of West Valley Nuclear Services Co., a subsidiary of 
Westinghouse Electric Corp. ``There's no clearcut solution here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The private Nuclear Fuel Services reprocessed nuclear fuel rods  
on 200 acres of the site from 1966 to 1972. NFS believed there was 
money to be made in recovering used uranium to make new fuel. But 
when the project halted for expansion in 1972 after processing 640 
tons of fuel, it was never to resume, deterred by high costs and 
increasingly stringent government controls. 
</P>
<P>
	Left behind were an underground carbon-steel tank of liquid  
waste measuring 70 feet in diameter and 30 feet deep, a 
concrete-walled processing facility littered with pieces of nuclear 
fuel rods and spent fuel assemblies stored in water. 
</P>
<P>
	The state took control of the site in 1976. Four years later,  
President Carter signed the West Valley Demonstration Project Act 
authorizing its cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
	Westinghouse, the developer of the atomic engine for the first  
nuclear-powered sub, the USS Nautilus, has been the project's 
primary contractor since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	The waste-to-glass process, known as vitrification, was  
undertaken to keep the liquid from seeping, as a result of rupture 
or corrosion, through the single-hulled storage tank into the 
ground. The site is criscrossed by several streams and the waste 
eventually could have found its way to Lake Erie and Buffalo's 
water intakes. Had that happened, the city's drinking water might 
have been contaminated for 300 years. 
</P>
<P>
	During vitrification, liquid waste is mixed with silica, heated  
to about 2,000 degrees and poured into the stainless steel 
canisters, which are then capped, dipped in acid to remove excess 
glass and placed on carts to be rolled into storage. 
</P>
<P>
	``These guys are wizards,'' Little said of the workers who  
accomplish the delicate task via remote control and video screens 
as if playing a video game. ``They can take an aspirin bottle, take 
the cap off and remove a single aspirin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the low-level waste from West Valley is transported by  
tractor-trailers to a site in Clive, Utah. Those shipments began 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	With 250 canisters of the high-level waste filled, about 10 more  
remain to be filled, but the difficulty in getting at the remaining 
sludge in the bottom of the tank has slowed progress. 
</P>
<P>
	The work so far has impressed the Coalition on West Valley  
Nuclear Wastes, a citizens group that has been a constant watchdog 
for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're pleased to death that it worked,'' Carol Mongerson said  
of the solidification. ``We're pleased to see they've gotten 
through it -- and relieved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for the next step of cleanup, the coalition favors the  
removal of the tank from the site and for material buried in an 
on-site dump to be excavated and stored on site only until a 
permanent repository opens. 
</P>
<P>
	That is the most costly solution among the four now on the  
table. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would like to see that tank removed, not just filled with  
concrete,'' Ms. Mongerson said, ``at least before institutional 
control ends. That's another large issue. How long are we going to 
have the government -- either the DOE or the state -- on site?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The answer to that is not yet known.

<HEADLINE> Freeh: Schools Must Teach Honesty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Teaching honesty, fairness and other essential  
values is crucial for students and public servants alike, FBI 
Director Louis J. Freeh told graduates of Marymount University on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeh said his interest in ethics was renewed by a recent trip  
to Normandy, France, where he saw the D-Day beaches. He contrasted 
the 19- and 20-year-olds who fought in World War II to today's 
generation, in which a majority of high school students say their 
biggest challenges are ethical ones. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeh said he tells new FBI agents that no matter how much they  
learn in training, the most important lessons come at age 2 or 3: 
tell the truth, be fair and compassionate, do not steal or lie. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those are the basic requirements that democracy particularly  
and civilization generally require of all of us,'' Freeh said. 
</P>
<P>
	Education provides an important role in teaching ethics, Freeh  
said. He praised Marymount University, a Catholic school in 
Arlington, Va., for its Center for Ethical Concerns and said core 
values should be a stronger part of FBI training.

<HEADLINE> Wolves Took Step Backward in '99 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Flip Saunders insists the Minnesota  
Timberwolves will fill their two most pressing needs this summer, 
getting a center who can play the low post and a guard who can 
create problems by getting to the basket. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guarantee that this offseason will be a big offseason for  
us,'' the coach said. ``And we will do a lot of things to put a 
spark back in our organization like where it was last year at this 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, they could have solved their problems in January had  
Kevin McHale, Minnesota's vice president of basketball operations, 
accepted the Los Angeles' Lakers offer of Eddie Jones and Elden 
Campbell for Tom Gugliotta. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Gugliotta left Minnesota for Phoenix and a six-year  
contract worth about $60 million, some $27 million less than he 
could have had in Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	Had McHale agreed to that deal, maybe Stephon Marbury wouldn't  
have forced his trade to New Jersey, leaving the Wolves with point 
guard Terrell Brandon, who will play the free-agent field. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was not the season we had wanted, being an eighth seed  
and being knocked out in the first round,'' center Dean Garrett 
said. ``We had trades, injuries and new guys coming all year. We 
can't afford to have guys coming in late to our system. We need to 
have everyone here all season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The departures of Gugliotta and Marbury left the Wolves with  
just one star, Kevin Garnett, who couldn't carry the team by 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were just starting to create a rhythm,'' Garnett said. ``I  
was getting a feel for others' games. I had dreams of us going far 
in the playoffs. I don't know what to expect now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Garnett said reaching the playoffs, even at 25-25, took a  
little of the sting away. 
</P>
<P>
	``With what we have been through and who we have lost, people  
didn't expect us to get this far,'' he said. ``Some of our guys 
didn't know what the playoffs were about. They learned that 
defending at home is important. At least people could take some 
good things out of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This was a season full of what-ifs for the Wolves, who were  
bounced from the playoffs in the first round for the third straight 
season, this time 3-1 by the top-seeded San Antonio Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're disappointed,'' Brandon said. ``You could say if we had  
more time to jell, we could have done better. But we were still 
able to make the playoffs. We played as hard as we could. If the 
young players continue to listen to and learn from the veteran 
players, the sky's the limit for this franchise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Wolves had the Nets' lottery pick and their own, No. 14, in  
the draft next month, and they'll try to be a player in the free 
agent market, too. 
</P>
<P>
	The one thing Saunders wants to scrap is his team's reliance on  
the jump shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to get a player, one way or another, whether it's a  
perimeter player or an inside player, that can get to the basket 
and get fouled,'' Saunders said. ``I bet over the last three or 
four weeks of the season we probably outscored everybody we played 
from the field but we've been beat up at the free throw line. 
</P>
<P>
	``In order to take the next step, we've got to be able to go at  
David Robinson, go at Tim Duncan, get them in some foul trouble and 
get ourselves to the free throw line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Smith, who signed a paltry $1.75 million one-year contract  
for the chance to reestablish himself as one of the league's 
bright, young stars, might sign a long-term extension with the 
Wolves. 
</P>
<P>
	Brandon is another story.  
</P>
<P>
	He wants to know what it feels like to be courted by some  
big-bucks owner and even though his agent, Bill Duffy, is a former 
college roommate of McHale's, keeping him from bolting to sunnier 
climes is going to be difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just once I want to know what it feels like to be a free  
agent,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	And just once the Wolves would like to know what it feels like  
to reach Round 2 in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our No. 1 focus, we need to bring in a dynamic player,''  
Saunders said. ``To add energy to our team. And I think we owe it 
to our fans, also, to show our commitment. We need to get long-term 
commitments from our players so our fans know we're going to be a 
team that's going to be here and a team that you can build and keep 
it together and have a chance to win championships.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One bright spot in the Wolves' future is 7-foot rookie center  
Radoslav Nesterovic of Slovenia, who signed just before the 
playoffs and held his own against David Robinson in 18 minutes of 
playing time Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Garnett, who was disappointed at being snubbed for the NBA's  
all-defensive team, said he welcomed the break, albeit earlier than 
he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to sleep until 5 in the afternoon. I'm going to  
visit my mom and grandma. I'm going to see some Lynx games and 
cheer them on,'' he said. ``I want to live it up. 
</P>
<P>
	``But at the same time, I'm going to be back in the lab to see  
what I can do better,'' Garnett said. ``Hopefully, next year, I'll 
make first-team something. I want to be the best.''

<HEADLINE> Sacramento Laments Missed Chances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- While the Sacramento Kings took the Utah  
Jazz to the brink of elimination, their failure to push the Jazz 
over the brink -- either in Game 4 or Game 5 -- left them frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
	``I honestly thought we outplayed them in the series,'' said Jon  
Barry, who scored 14 points in the Kings' 99-92 overtime loss in 
Game 5 while playing 38 minutes. ``We just didn't come out on top. 
I feel like we won today's game. We proved we have tremendous 
heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The last two games of the series -- Game 4, which was won on a  
last-gasp jumper by John Stockton, and the overtime nail-biter in 
Game 5 -- made elimination particularly hard to take for Chris 
Webber. 
</P>
<P>
	``That hurts,'' said Webber, who scored 12 points and grabbed 14  
rebounds Sunday but had just three points after halftime and was 
5-for-17 from the field. ``We really felt like we would win today 
and win the series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel I played my best series, especially today. But we  
wanted to make them (Jazz) look old, and we started to make them 
look old. We saw them at their weakest and we saw them at their 
strongest. We wanted to be the ones to upset them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Kings looked as if they were going to do just that. Vlade  
Divac made a hook shot in the lane over Karl Malone with 58 seconds 
to play to give the Kings an 88-85 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	After Bryon Russell made a 3-pointer from the right corner to  
tie it with 48.5 seconds to play, Sacramento and Divac had two more 
good chances. But Divac missed a layup with 30 seconds to play, and 
after he rebounded a miss by John Stockton with 9.2 seconds left, 
the Kings set up their final play for Divac. 
</P>
<P>
	His hook shot slid off the rim as time expired. In overtime, the  
Jazz ended the Kings' Cinderella story. 
</P>
<P>
	``Vlade had a good look,'' said coach Rick Adelman, his eyes  
welling with tears. ``We just didn't get it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Webber: ``We had confidence in Vlade. We thought we were  
going to win on that shot. You can't get a better chance than Vlade 
and the 'Kareem' hook.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Kings' youth showed in the game, as Sacramento was 6-for-29  
on 3-pointers and a meager 18-of-30 on the free throw line. Rookie 
point guard Jason Williams was 1-for-6 from the field and missed 
all three of his 3-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry and Vernon Maxwell had huge games off the bench for  
Sacramento. Barry scored 14 points, while Maxwell had 22 points in 
place of Williams and kept the Kings in the game in the second 
half. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite being eliminated in the first round, the Kings players  
said they proved something to the league. 
</P>
<P>
	``We came in here, and they thought it was going to be an easy  
win,'' Maxwell said. ``We took them to overtime. We feel good about 
ourselves, because we weren't even supposed to be in this 
predicament. ... We still feel strong and feel good about 
ourselves. We're looking forward to next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Before the season, we weren't even thinking about the  
playoffs,'' said Divac. ``We got in and almost won. But you can't 
be satisfied. You always want to try to get more, and try to 
improve.''

<HEADLINE> Magic Season Ends in Disappointment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- The end had a familiar feel for the Orlando  
Magic, who spent much of the season overachieving only to lose in 
the opening round of the NBA playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Penny Hardaway's offense was nowhere to be found when the team  
needed him most, letting down a club that heightened expectations 
by sharing the best record in the Eastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen Iverson led the Philadelphia 76ers to a 3-1 victory in  
their best-of-5 series with Orlando in part because he outplayed 
the Magic's leading scorer. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway averaged 19 in the series. However, he struggled to get  
involved offensively in the last three games and enjoyed most of 
his success after the Magic trailed by double digits in Games 3 and 
4. 
</P>
<P>
	He complained after the third game that coach Chuck Daly wasn't  
running enough plays for him, then missed his first nine shots on 
the way to a 3-for-17 performance in Saturday's 91-81 loss that 
ended the season. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the questions the Magic and their star have to resolve  
during the offseason is whether Hardaway, once billed as the next 
Michael Jordan, has played his last game for Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-time All-Star has said he plans to exercise an option  
in his contract that allows him to become a free agent. And 
although he's also said he'd like to remain with the Magic, the 
team could elect to re-sign and trade him. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly, finishing the second-year of his contract, also has a  
decision to make. He has an option to return as coach at $5 
million, take a $200,000 consultant job with the Magic or move to 
another team. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're hoping that both Chuck and Penny are back,'' said  
general manager John Gabriel. ``I think in this series, we learned 
some things about this team. We'll evaluate and see where we need 
to add to take the next step.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daly called the season perhaps his most enjoyable in coaching.  
The Magic began the lockout-shortened schedule thinking they'd earn 
the seventh or eighth playoff seed and wound up winning 33 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Players bought Daly's concept that good defense not only would  
shut down opponents, but create more opportunities on offense than 
a playbook ever could. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookies Matt Harpring and Michael Doleac proved to be quick  
learners and contributed despite not having the benefit of a 
regular training camp to prepare for their first season. 
</P>
<P>
	And despite a strained relationship, Daly and Hardaway got along  
well enough that the Magic overachieved until a season-high, 
five-game losing streak threatened to tear the team apart. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway, who had struggled at point guard, and Nick Anderson  
bickered over which of them should play off-guard. They were urged 
to stop feuding during a players-only meeting, and the team 
responded by winning the last four games going into the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	With or without Hardaway, finding help at point guard will be a  
priority. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Darrell Armstrong had his best season, earning the  
NBA's Sixth Man award, Hardaway's desire to play shooting guard 
makes it essential to add another playmaker. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel pretty good about what this group was able to  
accomplish,'' Daly said. ``We're not where we want to be, not as 
good as we can be, but we've made a lot of improvement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The stage was set for an early playoff exit when the Magic lost  
Game 1 in Orlando, dropping homecourt advantage. They held Iverson 
to 13 points to win Game 2, but the league scoring champion and his 
energetic young teammates were too much to overcome on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an awkward year with the lockout and then playing so  
many games in so short of a time. But we overachieved all season 
long. We really played over our heads ... Nobody expected us to get 
33 wins and become a favorite,'' Hardaway said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But then we get into the playoffs and get a draw like  
Philadelphia, who has played us tough all year long. They've sort 
of had our number. But this season was not a failure.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Italy Floats Cease-Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Italy's premier has proposed that NATO call a  
cease-fire in its air campaign against Yugoslavia if Russia and 
China approve a U.N. Security Council resolution outlining the 
allies' peace terms, according to an interview published Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	However, should Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic reject the  
resolution, NATO would step up the attack with ground troops, La 
Repubblica daily quoted Massimo D'Alema as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Alema, whose country is a key base for the air campaign  
against Yugoslavia, said he had raised his proposal with France and 
with NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana, and would bring it up 
with Germany's leader this week, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian premier has faced opposition to the NATO campaign by  
the public and opposition parties, and by some members of his 
center-left coalition. Anti-war activists marched Sunday demanding 
a NATO cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO has rejected calls for a halt in the bombing campaign until  
Milosevic accepts its demands. 
</P>
<P>
	However, in Brussels, Belgium, NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said  
the alliance ``welcomes all diplomatic initiatives that can help to 
resolve this crisis on the basis of the five conditions of the 
international community, without which the crisis cannot be 
resolved, but only postponed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plan approved by Russia and Western allies earlier this  
month demands Yugoslavia accept an international force in Kosovo 
and the return of ethnic Albanian refugees. Diplomats are working 
to push through a Security Council resolution upholding the terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia and China, which oppose the NATO campaign, have called  
for it to be halted to allow for peace efforts. D'Alema's proposed 
cease-fire presumably would entice their support for the resolution 
and give Milosevic breathing room to accept. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that the United Nations' entry into the field with a  
political initiative would offer a way out for Serb pride,'' he was 
quoted by La Repubblica as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	If it doesn't, he said, ``we would need to send ground troops.''

<HEADLINE> Czechs Win World Hockey Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LILLEHAMMER, Norway (AP) -- Jan Hlavac beat Finnish goalie Miikka  
Kiprusoff off a rebound at 16:32 of overtime Sunday, giving the 
Czech Republic its seventh World Hockey Championships title. 
</P>
<P>
	Finland, last year's losing finalist to Sweden, won Sunday's  
second final game 4-1 to force the 20-minute overtime. The Czech 
Republic won the opener 3-1 Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Czechs carried the play in overtime and had several scoring  
chances before Hlavac's winner. The Finns, supported by thousands 
of fans in Olympic Hakons Hall, failed to generate any offense in 
the extra period. 
</P>
<P>
	Goalie Milan Hnilicka, the hero Saturday, had a nightmarish  
start, surrendering two goals less than six minutes into the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Defenseman Antti-Jussi Niemo fired a slap shot past Hnilicka  
from the right circle at 1:41, and Juha Lind, who scored the Finns' 
one goal Saturday, made it 2-0 at 5:35. 
</P>
<P>
	Marko Tuomainen tipped in Jere Karalahti's slap shot from the  
blue line, giving the Finns a 3-0 lead at 1:51 of the second period 
with the Czechs shorthanded. 
</P>
<P>
	Viktor Ujcik broke away to score for the Czechs at 10:47, with  
the puck taking a lucky bounce off Kiprusoff's pads and hitting the 
post before trickling over the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
	Ville Peltonen, who was his team's top scorer when Finland won  
its only previous world championship over Sweden in 1995, connected 
with another slap shot from the left circle early in the third 
period for Finland's fourth goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Saku Koivu, the Montreal Canadiens star who led tournament  
scorers with four goals and 12 assists, missed the second final 
because of an arm injury. The Finnish captain was slashed late in 
the third period Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweden beat Canada in Saturday's bronze-medal game.

<P>
	PORT HURON, Mich. (AP) -- A school district where police say they  
foiled a plot by four middle school students for a mass-murder 
rampage like that at Colorado's Columbine High School tentatively 
plans to resume classes Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Port Huron Public Schools and police said they quickly  
decided to close all 21 schools Friday after discovering the plot 
by four students at Holland Woods Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
	Superintendent Bill Kimball said he has formed a committee to  
create a security plan for the district that would be detailed 
publicly Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``With over 30 years in education ... I have never been involved  
in a situation this disruptive to the educational process,'' 
Kimball said. ``There is tremendous fear on the part of the student 
body.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Justin Schnepp and Jedaiah Zinzo, both 14, were charged as  
adults with conspiracy to commit murder, and ordered held on 
$100,000 bond apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other suspects were charged as juveniles with the same  
crime. One of those boys is 13. Police said the other boy is 12, a 
prosecutor said he is 13. 
</P>
<P>
	They are expected to appear Tuesday for a probate hearing in St.  
Clair County Juvenile Court. All four remained in custody Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Police allege the suspects planned to kill people at Holland  
Woods, which has about 560 students in grades six through eight. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month in Littleton, Colo., teenage gunmen Eric Harris and  
Dylan Klebold killed 13 people at Columbine before committing 
suicide.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Fund-Raising Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- President Clinton slipped his right  
hand into his pants pocket and his voice eased into a 
conversational tone: ``Let's talk about the entertainment issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The eyes on him, from a small stone patio overlooking the lights  
of Los Angeles, belonged to Hollywood's hottest -- Jeffrey 
Katzenberg, David Geffen, Rob Reiner, Goldie Hawn, Kurt Russell, 
Dennis Quaid and Steven Spielberg, whom Clinton called ``Steve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All had just paid the Democratic Party between $25,000 and  
$100,000 for a Wolfgang Puck-catered dinner with the president. 
``You've helped me through thick and thin for all these long 
years,'' Clinton told the intimate assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	So it was that Clinton, pushing a national campaign against the  
kind of youth violence seen in the Colorado school shootings, only 
gently took entertainment types to task for movies and TV shows 
that glorify violence. He softly prodded changes in their ads and 
ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no call for finger-pointing here. ... We are  
determined to do this as a family,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He spoke Saturday at Greystone Mansion, a city-owned landmark  
that was the set of ``Ghostbusters II,'' in which only the 
paranormal were liquefied to green goo by phaser-like guns. 
</P>
<P>
	Hawn, squeezing past reporters to sneak a smoke with Kurt  
Russell, ignored questions about the president's challenge to 
Hollywood. Lisa Kudrow, of TV's ``Friends,'' played dumb: ``What? I 
haven't spoken to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, before leaving Los Angeles for San Diego, Clinton  
stopped for brunch at the Malibu home of Barbara Streisand and her 
husband James Brolin. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Welcome gun manufacturers to that family Clinton spoke about.  
</P>
<P>
	In a series of fund-raising speeches on this $3-million West  
Coast weekend swing for Democrats, Clinton has been singing praise 
for the gun makers' support of crackdowns on gun show sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitting them against the National Rifle Association, Clinton  
said he was ``very proud'' of gun makers ``who for years sided 
always with the NRA ... and who supported the legislation this time 
in Congress and had the kind of civic responsibility that we need 
more from every American.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	They say Clinton has a steel-trap memory.  
</P>
<P>
	Exhibit A: Friday night's speech to donors in Portola Valley,  
Calif., where Clinton recalled in vivid detail a Tina Turner 
concert in Little Rock, Ark., more than a decade ago. He and five 
friends in the middle of the front row. 
</P>
<P>
	``I forget, Hillary had to go some place that night. ...  
</P>
<P>
	``And behind us there was a lady I later found out was a  
hairdresser in a small town about 50 miles away, dressed in a tiger 
outfit complete with ears and tail and everything. It was an 
interesting night, all right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Exhibit B: Saturday's $2 million dinner with the stars. ``I was  
laughing with Goldie Hawn tonight because I remember her being in 
the Biltmore in Los Angeles on June 2, 1992, when I was nominated 
for president ... all the stories were the exit polls showing that 
Ross Perot was really in first place.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Dinner with the president: $25,000 to $100,000 per couple. Shoes  
optional. 
</P>
<P>
	Hawn padded around the elegant and Gothic-styled Greystone  
Mansion in halter top and bare feet, picking at her rat's nest 
hairdo. Spielberg and Geffen wore white sneakers. Russell sported 
cowboy boots. Quaid was in T-shirts, jeans and bomber jacket. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was one of the few who bothered with a necktie.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The president spoke in Beverly Hills after a free day with his  
daughter, Chelsea, at the secluded, northern California hillside 
home of computer magnate Steven Jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors said father and daughter took a walk together. Clinton  
said Hillary Rodham Clinton joined in the day by telephone. ``We 
called her and then we got lonesome and we'd call her again,'' he 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton painted a portrait of cozy domesticity remembering the  
family's pre-White House life in the Arkansas governor's mansion. 
``I was happy as a clam at home, with Hillary and Chelsea and the 
life we had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Looking ahead, Clinton said he was consulting on his Little  
Rock, Ark., presidential library with Spielberg. ``We were talking 
about whether we could have some virtual reality effects in my 
library in the museum, you know,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes I feel like I'm living in virtual reality, so I'm  
highly interested in this.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Wrapping up his fund-raising sprint from Seattle to the San  
Francisco Bay area to Beverly Hills, to San Diego to Las Vegas, 
Clinton decided Sunday to skip a scheduled ``down'' day on the golf 
courses of Vegas and return to Washington Monday seven hours 
earlier than originally planned. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides said the president looked ahead to an over-full travel  
schedule for the week -- New York on Wednesday, Littleton, Colo., on 
Thursday, Virginia on Saturday, and Grambling, La., on Sunday -- and 
decided he needed some more time in the office on Monday.

	CHICAGO (AP) -- Mia Hamm tied the career record for international  
goals Sunday and helped send the U.S. women's soccer team past the 
Netherlands 3-0, its second victory over the Dutch in three days. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamm, the country's most popular female soccer player, scored  
her 107th goal in the 53rd minute in this tuneup game for next 
month's Women's World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	She took cross from Cindy Parlow and dribbled between two  
defenders before scoring with her left foot. The shot hit the 
crossbar and dropped for the goal and a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamm, playing her 171st game with the national team, shares the  
goals record with Italy's Elisabetta Vignotto, who played in the 
1970s and 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd roared as the ball hit the ground, and Hamm raised her  
right arm. She jumped and pumped her fist before being surrounded 
by her teammates. The ball was retrieved for her and marked with 
No. 107. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamm also assisted on Brandi Chastain's second goal, a header in  
the 81st minute. Hamm had a chance to set the record in the 54th 
and 59th minutes, but both shots went wide. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States is 12-2-1 this year, including 6-1 on the tour  
leading to the World Cup. The U.S. women will play two more games 
before the showcase event, which begins June 19. The U.S. roster 
for the World Cup will be announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, which has lost just once at home in the last  
55 matches, was on the Dutch side of the field for almost the 
entire game. The Americans outshot the Netherlands 26-2. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States got the only goal it needed in the 14th  
minute. There was a battle for the ball in front of the Dutch goal 
before Chastain got control and shot sharply into the upper right 
corner of the net. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has outscored its opponents 23-0 in the last  
four games, including a 5-0 victory over the Dutch on Thursday in 
Milwaukee.

<HEADLINE>  Lukas Finally Has Triple Crown Shot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- D. Wayne Lukas has trained the winners of 12  
Triple Crown races, but never a Triple Crown champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of the things that are not on my resume,'' said  
Lukas, whose horses have earned almost $200 million. ``I'd love to 
have it. The chance comes along so seldom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On June 5, a strapping chestnut named Charismatic can become the  
12th Triple Crown champion and first since Affirmed in 1978 by 
winning the 1 1/2-mile Belmont Stakes. A victory would make Lukas the 
10th trainer of a Triple Crown winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunny Jim Fitzsimmons and Ben Jones each trained two Triple  
Crown champions. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's starting to figure it out,'' Lukas said Sunday on the  
morning after Charismatic added a victory in Preakness to his 
triumph in the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Now maybe the bettors will start to figure out that Charismatic  
is for real. 
</P>
<P>
	His Derby victory was worth $64.60, the third largest in the  
race's 125-year history. It was treated by many handicappers and 
fans as a fluke -- a good-luck trip in a crowded field -- and so he 
went to the post Saturday at Pimlico as an 8-1 shot. 
</P>
<P>
	That made him the longest-priced Kentucky Derby winner in the  
Preakness since Dark Star was 11-1 when he finished fifth in 1953. 
</P>
<P>
	It's certain Charismatic will be a short price in the Belmont.  
After all, he is fast becoming charismatic. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Chris Antley, Charismatic moved to the threshold of  
racing immortality by sweeping past horses on the turn, opening a 
three-length lead with about one-eighth of a mile remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	At the wire, he was 1 1/2 lengths ahead of Menifee, with Badge  
another head back and 2 1/2 lengths ahead of Stephen Got Even in the 
field of 13 3-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
	The time for the 1 3-16 miles was 1:55.32 after rapid opening  
fractions of 22.50 for the quarter mile and 45.27 for the half. 
</P>
<P>
	This will be the third straight year the Triple Crown has been  
on the line in the Belmont. Silver Charm failed by three-quarters 
of a length in 1997 and Real Quiet was a nose short last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic is owned by Bob and Beverly Lewis, owners of Silver  
Charm, trained by Bob Baffert, also the trainer of Real Quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he has the style and strength to get it done,'' Lukas  
said of Charismatic, who was racing for the fourth time in 42 days. 
It was his third straight win. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic will go back to Lukas' barn at Churchill Downs on  
Monday. He probably will have his final Belmont workout there on 
June 1, then be flown to New York from Louisville the next day. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas said Cat Thief, third in the Derby and seventh in the  
Preakness, will skip the Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	The Belmont could have 10 to 12 starters and expected to take  
another shot at Charismatic are Menifee, Badge and Stephen Got 
Even. 
</P>
<P>
	Menifee, also second in the 1 1/4-mile Derby, is trained by Elliott  
Walden, trainer of Victory Gallop, who finished second last year in 
the Derby and Preakness, then beat Real Quiet in the Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Got Even's performance pleased trainer Nick Zito in the  
wake of his 14th-place finish in the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Badge paid a show price of $18.80, the same as Charismatic's  
winning mutuel return, in his first start since finishing fourth in 
the Wood Memorial on April 10 at Aqueduct. 
</P>
<P>
	It appears Baffert won't have a horse in the Belmont.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think I'm getting off at this bus stop,'' he said after his  
filly Excellent Meeting was pulled up by jockey Kent Desormeaux 
because of a breathing problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``She couldn't get her air,'' Dr. Larry Bramledge, a  
veterinarian, said after the race. ``It's like asthma in people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We scoped her and she's OK,'' Baffert said. ``We think she may  
have displaced (her soft palate) and lost her air.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trip to Baltimore certainly was anything but a failure for  
Baffert. He won the Pimlico Special on May 8 with Real Quiet and 
then won the Black-Eyed Susan on Friday with the filly 
Silverbulletday, who was scratched from the Preakness after getting 
the No. 14 post. 
</P>
<P>
	Trainer Randy Morse said it appeared Torrid Sand (11th) also  
displaced his palate and would require arthroscopic throat surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Belmont probables include Lemon Drop Kid, ninth in the  
Kentucky Derby; Comeonmom, second in the Remsen at Aqueduct in his 
start in November; Best of Luck, second in the Wood Memorial; 
Vision and Verse, the Illinois Derby winner; and Pineaff, third in 
the Illinois Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Comeonmom is owned by Godolphin Racing, operated by members of  
the Maktoum family of United Arab Emirates. Godolphin's Worldly 
Manner, a good seventh in the Kentucky Derby in his first start 
this year, went off as third betting choice in the Preakness and 
finished 12th after being in position to win on the final turn.

<HEADLINE> FBI Reports Drop in Crime Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Preliminary FBI figures show that serious  
crime has dropped for the seventh consecutive year, a trend that 
Attorney General Janet Reno attributed to the administration's 
effective anti-crime policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Raw figures for 1998 indicated a 7 percent decline from 1997 in  
reported violent crimes and property offenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Decreases were recorded for both violent crimes -- murder, rape,  
robbery and aggravated assault -- and property offenses -- burglary, 
larceny-theft, motor vehicle thefts and arson, said the report 
issued Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Robberies were down 11 percent and vehicle thefts dropped 10  
percent from 1997 levels, while murders fell 8 percent and rape and 
aggravated assault were both down by 5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Motor vehicle theft dropped 10 percent, and burglary and arson  
figures were each 7 percent lower, officials said. The number of 
larceny-thefts was down 6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department provided percentage changes but not  
overall totals for the number of each type of crime reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said the general decline showed the overall successes of  
the Clinton administration's crime-fighting efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a combination of many factors, including more police  
officers, common-sense laws requiring background checks on gun 
purchasers, community policing, legislation banning assault 
weapons, practical partnerships between law enforcement and the 
communities they serve, more crime prevention programs and a host 
of effective comprehensive crime strategies,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton termed the seven-year trend ``remarkable,''  
saying in a statement: ``More community police on our streets and 
fewer guns in the hands of criminals have helped make our 
communities the safest they have been in a generation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans question the effectiveness of the administration's  
cops-on-the-streets program and say there's still too little being 
done to crack down on violent criminals. They are backing a 
juvenile justice bill in Congress that would toughen penalties and 
introduce some new prevention programs for young offenders. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats are using the same bill to push for tougher gun  
control laws. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 17,000 city, county and state law enforcement agencies  
voluntarily submit data each year for the FBI's Uniform Crime 
Reporting Program. The totals are published yearly in a report 
called ``Crime in the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Final figures are not available until this fall.  
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department said overall declines of 8 percent were  
reported by law enforcement agencies in Northeastern and Western 
states. The South reported decreases of 6 percent, and the Midwest 
4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of murders dropped in all regions, led by 11 percent  
declines in the Northeast and West. In addition, the number of 
serious crimes fell in cities of all sizes. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI figures were announced two days after the Senate, as  
part of the juvenile justice bill, voted 48-47 to place new 
restrictions on sales of firearms at gun shows despite Democratic 
assertions the legislation was filled with loopholes. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's acrimonious, partisan debate was spurred in part by  
last month's massacre at a Colorado high school that left 15 
people, including two young gunmen, dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing that shooting, Clinton said the government has ``a  
responsibility to support law enforcement officers and pass 
common-sense gun legislation,'' such as ensuring background checks 
are required for purchases at gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Gun control is not the only reason crime has been going down,  
said Naomi Paiss of Handgun Control Inc., ``but no one can argue 
that the availability of the guns in this country is a prime factor 
in predicting the decline of the crime rate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But a gun industry group said crime has declined because of more  
aggressive law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that has much at all to do with gun control.  
What I think it has to do with is law enforcement getting serious 
about enforcing laws that are already on the books,'' said Robert 
Ricker, executive director of the American Shooting Sports Council. 
``The crime rate is dropping across the board, not just gun crime, 
and I think that's because of enforcement.''

<HEADLINE> Many Supreme Court Rulings Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Poised to begin its annual spring sprint to a  
summer recess, a Supreme Court widely considered among history's 
most intellectual runs the risk of appearing to be one of the least 
energetic in recent times. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting Monday, the court is expected to issue 36 more signed  
decisions before ending, in late June, the 1998-99 term it began in 
October. That would raise the term total to 76, just one more than 
75 full-blown rulings issued in the 1995-96 term -- the fewest since 
the early 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
	Through the 1980s, the court averaged 140 signed decisions per  
term. 
</P>
<P>
	No one, not even the court's nine members, can explain why the  
number of decisions has dropped so sharply while the number of 
appeals reaching the court continues to climb, to more than 7,000 a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist has said the court  
efficiently could hear arguments in and fully decide 100 or so 
cases per term. But some legal experts think Rehnquist's 
conservative desire to have the court play a limited role in 
shaping American life is helping keep the decision total far lower. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the composition and interests of the court, I don't  
think we'd see anything too dramatic or disruptive if the justices 
were deciding more cases,'' said L. Michael Seidman, a Georgetown 
University law professor. 
</P>
<P>
	With what it has on tap, the nation's highest court nevertheless  
could significantly affect American law in the coming weeks. 
Anticipated decisions include these: 
</P>
<P>
	-- The validity of laws aimed at preventing street gang members  
and their friends from hanging out in public. The court is judging 
a Chicago anti-loitering ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Whether states may pay lower welfare benefits to newcomers  
than to longtime residents. California is doing so, with the 
blessing of Congress, but the justices are to decide whether such 
differing treatment violates some people's right to travel. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Can educators who fail to stop students from sexually  
harassing other students be sued and forced to pay monetary damages 
under a federal law banning gender bias? The court's ruling in a 
Georgia case will carry repercussions nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Must victims of sexual harassment and other forms of  
on-the-job bias prove their employers' conduct was egregious before 
they can collect punitive damages aimed at punishing and deterring 
misconduct? A District of Columbia case focuses on an important 
aspect of a federal law protecting workers. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Federal judges' authority to strike down election districts as  
products of unlawful racial consideration. A decision in a North 
Carolina congressional reapportionment case could have enormous 
influence on redistricting disputes that arise after the 2000 
census. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The scope of mentally disabled people's right to live in  
homelike settings rather than state hospitals. A Georgia case could 
yield the decade's most important ruling on treatment of the 
mentally disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	-- A trio of cases -- from Oregon, Colorado and Kansas -- tests the  
scope of the Americans with Disabilities Act. At issue in all three 
is whether the 1990 law protects people whose disability can be 
corrected, such as taking pills for high blood pressure or wearing 
glasses for extreme nearsightedness. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Can the federal government ban television and radio  
advertisements promoting privately owned casinos, in an effort to 
help compulsive gamblers? A free-speech case from Louisiana should 
provide the answer. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Disputes from Maryland and Montana will spark a decision on  
whether police can be sued for violating privacy rights when they 
let TV camera crews and other journalists accompany them into 
people's homes to observe arrests or searches.

and sticky notes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Third Voice creates for the first time a system of checks and  
balances on the Internet,'' said Chris Shipley, editor of 
DemoLetter, a technology newsletter. ``There is now a way to 
communicate at the point of context, which has tremendous 
implications.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone is going to enjoy the effect.  
</P>
<P>
	Web shoppers can stick a note on a retailer's site to complain  
they've seen the same item for $10 less elsewhere. Financial 
pundits can add warnings to corporate earnings reports. Voters can 
contradict politicians, alternative healers can rebut doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't buy this,'' said a note that popped up during a test of  
the system. ``This product is terrible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Here's how it works:  
</P>
<P>
	First, you download Third Voice software from its Internet site  
and install it on your computer. When you want to add a comment to 
a Web site, you simply click on an icon on your screen, type in 
your message and post it on the site. Third Voice messages can be 
inserted on any page where there is text. The creator of the page 
can't remove your comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The software also allows you to see the comments of others. If  
too many comments are attached to one spot, an icon will appear on 
that spot. Clicking the icon will give the reader a list of all 
comments, 10 at a time. 
</P>
<P>
	If you don't want to see any comments, you can simply turn Third  
Voice off. 
</P>
<P>
	Third Voice CEO and co-founder Eng-Siong Tan says the company  
won't restrict most comments, but an editorial team will take 
complaints about offensive or illegal speech from users of the 
service and assess whether the comments should be removed, similar 
to the way America Online polices its sites. In addition, comments 
will only be allowed from individuals, not corporations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to let Chrysler go on Ford's Web site and post  
a note,'' said Tan, acknowledging enforcement may be difficult 
considering the potential for a vast and growing number of 
comments. 
</P>
<P>
	The company will also offer a Web directory service that will  
rank Web sites by the number of Third Voice comments. The directory 
will carry advertising, which Tan hopes will generate income to 
support the venture. 
</P>
<P>
	But making money is his secondary goal, said Tan. ``We think of  
this as a small step back to the original meaning of the Web: Free, 
open expression for all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Parr, research director at International Data Corp., said  
Third Voice ``could be a breakthrough product.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Parr said the company faces significant challenges. The  
first is a chicken-and-egg issue. Initially Web surfers may not 
bother to download the Third Voice Software because the number of 
people posting comments is so few. 
</P>
<P>
	``They also have some potential problems with spam and  
information quality that are going to be harder to address, and 
could require a lot of human intervention to resolve.'' That won't 
be easy for a company with 26 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The technology has received some significant backing, more than  
$5.5 million in funds from the venture capitalists Mayfield Fund 
and Draper Fisher Jurvetson. 
</P>
<P>
	Third Voice is also offering private forums to groups who want  
to comment on specific Web pages, but do it without the world 
looking in. 
</P>
<P>
	Using this, teachers could host class discussions, researchers  
could peer review documents and office workers could share 
project-related information. 
</P>
<P>
	Leo Jolicoeur, who left his job as a vice president at the Web  
directory Infoseek to run business development for Third Voice, 
said that businesses could use the software to seek out and 
communicate directly with their customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``In addition to giving every user a voice on the Web, Third  
Voice also presents incredible appeal to advertisers, sponsors and 
transaction partners,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Smart Car May Lose Funding Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAMBURG, Germany (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler chief Juergen Schremp  
has threatened to cut investment in the mini Smart car if sales do 
not improve within six months, a newsmagazine reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Schremp, as quoted by the Der Spiegel report, said he would  
``turn off the money tap'' if he does not see a dramatic climb in 
orders for the cartoonish, two-seater car, which is built at a 
plant in Hambach, France. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler, which invested $1.1 billion in developing the  
Smart model, stands to lose an additional $1.1 billion to $1.6 
billion if the car fails, the magazine reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Although production was geared toward selling 140,000 Smart  
models this year, Schremp said the goal is now to sell 80,000 cars 
-- or else the project will have to be reconsidered, according to 
Der Spiegel. 
</P>
<P>
	Daimler already has changed management of the Smart unit,  
lowered prices and launched a sweeping ad campaign to improve 
sales, the magazine said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Smart car, which went on sale across Europe on Oct. 2, was  
developed by Micro Compact Car AG, a joint venture between 
Daimler-Benz and Swatch Group, the Swiss manufacturer of the Swatch 
wristwatch. In November, Swatch sold its stake in the project to 
Daimler. 
</P>
<P>
	The 8.25-foot-long car takes up just about half of a standard  
parking spot and runs on around a third less gas than its compact 
rivals. With its mix-and-match, brightly colored replaceable parts 
and all-plastic body, the car is aimed at a young market.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Friend Trie Faces Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Yah Lin ``Charlie'' Trie, a longtime  
friend of President Clinton accused of funneling illegal 
contributions to Democrats, goes on trial here Monday on a charge 
that he hid documents from a Senate investigation into political 
fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
	Trie, a former Little Rock restaurateur, is accused of  
obstructing justice by ordering an employee to destroy documents 
subpoenaed in 1997 by a federal grand jury and by the Senate 
Governmental Affairs Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	He could spend time in a federal prison if convicted, but faces  
even stiffer penalties if convicted of charges in Washington that 
he made and arranged illegal contributions to the Democratic 
National Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Trie is a central figure in the controversy over foreign-linked  
campaign donations to Democrats. The Senate Governmental Affairs 
Committee is investigating possible illegal campaign fund raising 
in the 1996 election. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, Trie is accused of making illegal contributions  
to buy access to Clinton and other top officials for himself and 
people like Chinese arms dealer Wang Jun, an adviser to the Chinese 
government whose company, Poly Technologies, has been implicated in 
the smuggling of arms into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	After Wang's February 1996 visit to the White House for coffee  
with Clinton was disclosed, the president acknowledged it was 
inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnny Chung, another Clinton donor, has pleaded guilty to  
making $20,000 in illegal contributions to Democrats, including the 
Clinton-Gore campaign. He told the House Government Reform 
Committee that a Chinese banker told him that Trie had asked for $1 
million from the Chinese government for political donations. 
</P>
<P>
	The obstruction charge against Trie in Arkansas stems from  
testimony from longtime Trie employee Dia Maria Mapili that he 
ordered her to get rid of documents subpoenaed in 1997 by a federal 
grand jury and by the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Trie has claimed that Justice Department leaks have hurt his  
chances for a fair trial. He suffered two legal setbacks last week 
when U.S. District Judge George Howard Jr. ordered a former Trie 
employee to testify at the trial and also ruled that evidence 
seized at Trie's local residence would be admissible. 
</P>
<P>
	His lawyers had discussed seeking a delay, concerned that  
pretrial publicity might hurt his chances of getting a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``You want to find 12 fair-minded people who don't have an  
opinion one way or the other through news coverage, and anytime you 
have pretrial press coverage it's a concern,'' said Sam Heuer, 
Trie's Arkansas attorney. ``But he's ready to go. He's looking 
forward to hopefully being exonerated.''

<HEADLINE> Blackhawks Jump to No. 4 in Lottery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Chicago Blackhawks cashed in on a longshot  
Sunday, converting a 3.7 percent chance to improve their spot in 
the NHL draft and moving up the maximum four spots from No. 8 to 
No. 4. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tampa Bay Lightning retained the No. 1 overall selection,  
with the No. 2 spot going to the expansion Atlanta Thrashers. 
</P>
<P>
	Only the four teams with the fewest regular season points --  
Tampa Bay, New York Islanders, Vancouver and Nashville -- and 
Atlanta had a chance at the No. 1 pick, and no team could move up 
more than four places. 
</P>
<P>
	Tampa Bay, with 47 points, had a 26 percent chance of getting  
the No. 1 pick and was able to retain the selection based on 
numerical combinations produced by a lottery machine. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be the second straight year that the Lightning get the  
No. 1 choice. They acquired the pick in two trades last year, 
moving up from No. 3 to select center Vincent Lecavalier, who had 
13 goals and 15 assists in 82 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Vancouver picks third, and after Chicago, the order of the draft  
will be the Islanders, Nashville, Washington, Los Angeles, Calgary, 
Montreal, the New York Rangers, Florida, Edmonton and San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, Anaheim. Carolina, St. Louis, Pittsburgh, Phoenix,  
Buffalo, Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago (acquired from Detroit), 
Toronto, Colorado, Ottawa, New Jersey and Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the Pavel Bure trade, Florida has the option to give  
Vancouver its No. 1 pick this year or next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blackhawks had the eighth-best chance of having their number  
sequence selected in the drawing, a weighted system that afforded 
teams with the fewest points the best chance of moving up. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be the first time since 1984 that the Blackhawks pick  
fourth or higher. They chose Ed Olczyk third overall that year. 
</P>
<P>
	The entry draft is set for Saturday, June 26, at the FleetCenter  
in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Center Patrik Stefan of the IHL's Long Beach Ice Dogs is the  
top-rated skater in North America in the final rankings compiled by 
the NHL's Central Scouting Service. The Czech Republic native had 
11 goals and 24 assists in 33 games but sustained a season-ending 
concussion March 31 after missing three months with another 
concussion and a spinal contusion earlier in the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Pavel Brendl, a right-wing for the WHL's Calgary Hitmen, is the  
No. 2 rated player. He finished the season as the league's top 
scorer with 73 goals and 61 assists in 68 games, and was the WHL 
Rookie of the Year.

<HEADLINE> Cosby Talks To Colgate Graduates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAMILTON, N.Y. (AP) -- Wearing a maroon baseball cap with a gold  
tassel hanging off to one side, Bill Cosby had some fatherly advice 
for Colgate University graduates. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're out of here. You can't sit around anymore. (Get a)  
J.O.B,'' he said in a commencement speech Sunday before the 677 
graduates. 
</P>
<P>
	Cosby, who opened his gown to reveal sneakers, warm-up pants and  
a college sweatshirt, looked and sounded more like Dr. Cliff 
Huxtable -- the character he made famous in the 1980s in ``The Cosby 
Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Your rooms are as filthy today as they were when you graduated  
from high school. And we want them cleaned up,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, in a more serious tone, Cosby pointed to a ramp leading  
off the stage and explained, ``That's the off ramp, and when you 
step off there you will be in the real world.''

<HEADLINE> Forbes: 14 Baseball Teams in Red </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Fourteen of the 30 major league baseball teams  
posted operating losses last year, Forbes magazine reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Dodgers lost $11.7 million on an estimated $108  
million in revenue -- in large part because of baseball's 
revenue-sharing system, which has baseball's top 13 
revenue-generating teams contributing $100 million to the 15 teams 
with the lowest revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	That didn't stop the New York Yankees -- which had to pay $13  
million in revenue sharing -- from raking in $23 million in net 
income on a league-best $175.5 million in 1998 revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not surprising, then, that Forbes estimates the New York  
Yankees' value at $491 million, the best in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cleveland Indians, put up for sale last week by owner Dick  
Jacobs, carry the second-highest value at $359 million, according 
to the Forbes survey. 
</P>
<P>
	The estimated values, based on a formula taking into account  
team revenues, the stadium, debt and city demographics, do not 
necessarily reflect what a team could get on the open market. 
</P>
<P>
	When he announced that he was selling the team, Jacobs spoke of  
getting $800 million, the amount offered for the NFL's Washington 
Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
	The last baseball team sold was the Los Angeles Dodgers, with  
Rupert Murdoch paying $350 million in 1998 for the franchise, 
Dodgers Stadium, the spring training complex in Vero Beach, Fla., 
and property in the Dominican Republic. Forbes values the Dodgers 
at $270 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Other teams recording operating losses included the Kansas City  
Royals ($10.9 million), Toronto Blue Jays ($9.5 million), Milwaukee 
Brewers ($8.8 million), Seattle Mariners ($8.6 million) San Diego 
Padres ($8 million), Chicago Cubs ($7.9 million) and Boston Red Sox 
($7.6 million). 
</P>
<P>
	Also in the red were the Minnesota Twins ($7.1 million), San  
Francisco Giants ($6.4 million), New York Mets ($5.2 million), 
Detroit Tigers ($4.5 million), Houston Astros ($3.7 million) and 
Anaheim Angels ($200,000). 
</P>
<P>
	After the Yankees, the next five highest operating incomes were  
Arizona ($22.5 million), Tampa Bay ($20.6 million), Colorado ($19.5 
million) Cleveland ($19 million) and Atlanta ($16.4 million). 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes defines operating income as revenues less player costs,  
selling, general and marketing expenses, stadium operations, 
coaches and player development costs and travel. It does not 
include earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation, though it 
does include revenue-sharing figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue-sharing income of $13 million allowed Montreal to record  
net income of $5.6 million, even though, according to Forbes, the 
Expos are the least valuable franchise at $84 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Florida Marlins, who slashed their payroll after winning the  
World Series in 1997, had $8.6 million in net income last year, 
thanks in part to $4 million from revenue sharing.

<HEADLINE> Use of Psychiatric Drugs Protested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- About 1,000 protesters, dressed in black and  
many carrying black balloons, picketed a convention of 
psychiatrists Saturday to demand they stop prescribing 
mind-altering medications to young people. 
</P>
<P>
	Such medicine leads to youth violence, said three protest  
leaders, actresses Kirstie Alley and Juliette Lewis and singer Lisa 
Marie Presley. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're making drug addicts out of our children,'' said Alley,  
best known for her roles on the TV shows ``Cheers'' and 
``Veronica's Closet.'' ``It's barbaric, and it's being promoted by 
psychiatrists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The demonstration, organized by the Church of Scientology's  
Citizens Commission on Human Rights, targeted the annual meeting of 
the American Psychiatric Association in downtown Washington. As 
they marched around the Washington Convention Center, the 
demonstrators chanted: ``Don't drug our kids. Don't shock our kids. 
Just leave our kids alone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All three of the celebrity demonstrators are Scientologists. The  
church's founder, L. Ron Hubbard, strongly opposed psychiatry.

</P>
<P>
	PORT HURON, Mich. (AP) -- City schools closed last week after the  
arrest of four students who allegedly planned a massacre similar to 
Colorado's Columbine High School slayings will reopen Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Police will be posted inside Holland Woods Middle School. A bomb  
was found near the school campus Thursday after school officials 
and parents gathered to discuss the alleged plot by the four 
students at the school. Police have said the bomb is unrelated to 
the alleged plot. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the district's 21 schools were closed Friday, then  
searched over the weekend and found to be safe, superintendent Bill 
Kimball said Sunday. Security will also be tightened district-wide 
on Monday, and teachers will discuss school safety with students. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're taking every measure possible to be sure our kids are  
safe,'' Kimball said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some parents were uncomfortable with the decision to reopen the  
schools in this city about 60 miles northeast of Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that they should just end the school year and have  
that extra three weeks to figure out what they're going to do to 
safeguard our kids for next year,'' said Heidy Martindale, the 
mother of a 12-year-old girl at Holland Woods. 
</P>
<P>
	She said parents were told at a meeting Thursday night that  
Holland Woods was safe. Within hours, a custodian found the bomb. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitney Fontenot, 12, a sixth grader at Holland Woods, cried  
when she heard that school would be reopened. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel uncomfortable going to that school,'' Whitney said.  
</P>
<P>
	Four Holland Woods students ages 12 to 14 remain jailed after  
being charged on Thursday with conspiracy to commit murder at the 
560-student school. 
</P>
<P>
	The two 14-year-olds, Justin Schnepp and Jedaiah Zinzo, have  
been charged as adults and are being held on $100,000 bond each. 
The younger students are to appear Tuesday in St. Clair County 
Juvenile Court. 
</P>
<P>
	All were arrested last week after a 14-year-old girl told police  
she overheard some of them talking about an elaborate school 
killing spree. The girl told police the boys said their plan was to 
go on a shooting spree in a gym assembly and detonate a bomb 
afterward, acts aimed at killing the school's ``preps,'' the 
popular clique of students. 
</P>
<P>
	Again Sunday, police and school district officials declined to  
comment on evidence in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials have said the teens planned to top the death toll of  
the April 20 massacre at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., 
where teenage gunmen Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed 13 before 
committing suicide.

<HEADLINE> Martin Lovin' 'La Vida Loca' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Riding the frenzy over his hit song ``Livin' la  
Vida Loca,'' Ricky Martin is loving his crazy life. 
</P>
<P>
	``What, are you kidding me?'' Martin says in the May 24 issue of  
Time. ``I'm flying. I'm flying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The enthusiastic crowd gathered to see the Puerto Rican singing  
star at a Manhattan record store last week outnumbered the throng 
across the street lined up for an advance screening of the new 
``Star Wars'' movie. 
</P>
<P>
	His self-titled debut album in English follows a string of  
successful Spanish-language albums, which in turn followed his run 
in the youth group Menudo. The 27-year-old also has co-starred on 
Broadway in ``Les Miserables'' and has appeared on the soap opera 
``General Hospital.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the instant success of his new album, Martin still gets  
the same question: Why cross over? 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people say, `Well, why English, why do you want to do  
it in the States?''' Martin said. ``It's all about communication. 
The last album (`Vuelve') did really good, to be quite honest -- I 
want to be humble about this -- all over the world. One of the songs 
was No. 1 in 22 countries. And it was in Spanish. So I didn't have 
to go to English to make it.''

<HEADLINE> Lunch Deduction Bill Gains Ground </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Five years ago, Congress and President Clinton  
sharply curtailed a tax break for businesses by slashing the amount 
of business meals they could deduct. Restaurants took a hit, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``People do not use their business meal deduction as much,''  
said Perry Moy, owner of the Plum Garden Restaurant in McHenry, 
Ill. ``I lost 30 percent of my lunch business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers now are lining up behind legislation that gradually  
would restore the deduction, but only for smaller businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not for the fat cats. This is really for business  
people out there hustling business,'' said a lead sponsor, Rep. Jim 
McCrery, R-La. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, the deduction was cut from 80 percent to 50 percent of  
a meal's cost to help reduce the federal budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislation sponsored by McCrery and Rep. John Tanner, D-Tenn.,  
would bring the deduction back to 80 percent over a six-year period 
beginning in 2000 -- but only for businesses with $5 million or less 
in annual gross receipts. 
</P>
<P>
	McCrery wants to help businesses struggling against big  
corporations and to defuse the argument that the measure would 
benefit wealthy business people and lobbyists who enjoy 
three-martini lunches. 
</P>
<P>
	Abe Schneier, lobbyist with the National Association of  
Wholesale Representatives, said meals often are the best times for 
a small-scale salesman or traveling representative to meet with 
clients and make deals. 
</P>
<P>
	``For them, the restaurant is their office,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	But sponsors say since the deduction was cut, the number of  
business meal spenders has dropped by more than 2 million, 
primarily among the self-employed and small businesses having a 
harder time absorbing the costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the group least able to sustain an attack on their  
margins,'' McCrery said. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Restaurant Association is leading the lobbying  
charge for the measure. The group recently set up a lunch with 
local business people in Houston for the chairman of the House Ways 
and Means Committee, Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas. Placemats for the 
meal sported a favorable editorial from Archer's hometown Houston 
Chronicle. 
</P>
<P>
	``He acknowledged that he understands this isn't just a  
restaurant issue,'' said Kathleen O'Leary, a restaurant association 
lobbyist in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Archer would say only that Archer, whose  
committee has jurisdiction over taxes, has talked extensively with 
those interested in the measure but had made no commitment to 
support it. 
</P>
<P>
	Working in the sponsors' favor is the bill's relatively modest  
cost of about $3 billion over five years. In addition, Republican 
leaders are considering the measure as one way to offset costs on 
small business of a likely increase in the minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it (the minimum wage) would happen by itself,''  
said Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla. ``We have to find sweeteners for 
business so they don't go ballistic on us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the proposal has significant Democratic support on  
Capitol Hill, the White House has not taken a public stand. 
</P>
<P>
	Initial drafts of this year's tax relief legislation will emerge  
in the House and Senate in July. Democrats and Republicans say the 
bill is most likely to include a variety of targeted tax breaks 
that are phased in slowly as anticipated non-Social Security budget 
surpluses grow. 
</P>
<P>
	The meal tax deduction would grow from 50 percent to 80 percent  
in 5 percent increments over six years, delaying its full cost 
impact -- and sponsors hope increasing its chances of passage. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can fashion the tax changes to take effect when we have the  
money,'' McCrery said.

<HEADLINE> Justice Questions Juror Exclusions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor  
today urged state judicial officials to re-examine how juries are 
chosen in an effort to bolster public confidence in the justice 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	She said they should review and even limit lawyers' rights to  
exclude possible jurors without giving a reason for doing so. Also 
recommended for scrutiny was the so-called ``cause'' exclusion of 
jurors who had heard about the court case from the media. 
</P>
<P>
	These practices, O'Connor said, give an impression of  
``unrepresentative juries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She also told the gathering of state chief justices, judges and  
bar association officials: ``The process of selecting a jury from 
the citizens called for jury service on a particular day has 
changed somewhat from a necessary safeguard from potentially biased 
jurors to a way, in many cases, for highly paid jury consultants to 
attempt to insure a jury favorable to the side paying their fee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her speech came near the end of a two-day conference on public  
trust and the courts. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor appealed to states to make juvenile and family courts a  
high priority and improve the quality of legal representation for 
people who cannot afford their own lawyers, especially in death 
penalty cases. 
</P>
<P>
	She also said lawyers can have too much leeway during jury  
selection through the use of peremptory challenges, in which 
potential jurors can be disqualified from serving without a stated 
reason. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor made no mention of the constitutionality of such  
practices and was speaking more to questions of policy and judicial 
procedure, which vary from state to state. The Supreme Court has 
narrowed how lawyers can use peremptory challenges, especially with 
factors of race and gender. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor warned that ``the use of unlimited or 'cause'  
challenges to perspective jurors, coupled with extensive media 
coverage of some cases, leaves some courts to search for the most 
ignorant and poorly informed citizens to serve as jurors in 
high-profile cases, because only those citizens are likely to have 
avoided forming any opinion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor also called for improved jury conditions -- ``When they  
arrive at the courthouse they're frequently treated more like sheep 
than people, and the system can seem designed to disrupt their 
lives.'' -- and said judges should explain to jurors the law in the 
case at the beginning of the trial as well as at the end. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Saturday, Justice Antonin Scalia, addressing graduates  
of Catholic University, praised the intellectual rigor they had 
just completed but cautioned that ``moral formation'' was the more 
important part of their education. 
</P>
<P>
	``Time was, not so long ago, when all education institutions  
took moral formation as a serious part of their mission,'' Scalia 
said. ``Today, sad to say, not only is moral formation not an 
objective of higher education, it is virtually a forbidden topic, 
whereas strong views of right and wrong is to be discriminating, 
which is the only sin left on campus, just as toleration is the 
only universally acknowledged virtue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The object is to place all options before young men and women  
from Jesus Christ through Larry Flynt so that they may choose for 
themselves and not, heaven forbid, be criticized for their 
choice,'' Scalia said.

<HEADLINE> Rubin Replacment: Strong Dollar Key </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANGKAWI, Malaysia (AP) -- A strong dollar is in the United  
States' national interest, U.S. Treasury Secretary-designate 
Lawrence Summers said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Secretary Rubin and I have seen this the same way for many  
years,'' he said. ``A strong dollar is very much in America's 
national interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is the first time Summers has commented on the dollar since  
he was nominated for the post of treasury secretary. Last week, 
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin submitted his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers made his remarks following a weekend gathering of  
Asia-Pacific finance ministers. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers said that a strong dollar benefits the United States by  
helping lower inflation and trade income. 
</P>
<P>
	``Experience suggests that nations can't devalue their way to  
prosperity,'' he added, referring to pressures to allow a lower 
currency to boost exports. ``The dollar should not be used as a 
tool of trade policy.''

	NATO Jets Strike Serbs Hard  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO jets struck hard in Kosovo  
Sunday and early Monday, while NATO officials say they've grown 
increasingly suspicious that the Serbs used Kosovar civilians as 
human shields in a bombing that reportedly killed 87 people. 
Yugoslavia protested that the intensive bombing is obstructing a 
partial withdrawal of its troops from Kosovo -- a complaint NATO 
spokesman Jamie Shea dismissed. Meanwhile, a 15-member U.N. team 
arrived in Belgrade en route to Kosovo, where they'll get a 
first-hand look at the war-torn province.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two Serb POWs being held by the U.S. military  
in Germany are set to be released, possibly on Monday, a Pentagon 
official says, but there was no indication of any linkage between 
this release and that of three U.S. soldiers earlier this month. 
The pending release of the Serb soldiers comes after three U.S. 
Army soldiers captured along the Kosovo-Macedonia border were 
turned over earlier this month. The two Serbs were turned over to 
U.S. military authorities in Albania by the Kosovo Liberation Army.

Netanyahu and Ehud Barak, a career military man likely to revive 
peacemaking efforts with the Palestinians. With the last two minor 
candidates dropping out Sunday, the contest was to be settled in a 
single ballot Monday. Netanyahu had hoped to push the race into a 
runoff, giving him two more weeks to campaign. Trailing in the 
polls, a combative Netanyahu nonetheless insisted that he'll win.

	BOSTON (AP) -- Fat paychecks, large bonuses, and a clear career

who are taking a leap into the potential for phenomenal wealth and 
success offered by an Internet startup. The number of Harvard 
Business School graduates saying they plan to go into 
high-technology businesses or start their own businesses has been 
rising over the last few years, and the jump from 1998 to 1999 has 
been especially robust, according to an informal student poll of

	New Prostate Treatment Unveiled  
</P>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- A new procedure for reducing enlarged  
prostates is less painful then surgery and doesn't require an 
overnight hospital stay, the doctor who developed it says. Prostate 
enlargement, which is not related to cancer, requires surgery, 
medication or other treatment in one-fourth of men by age 80, and 
nearly all show signs of the disorder by 85. The procedure is done 
with a device that is threaded through the urethra to inject small 
amounts of purified alcohol into the prostate. The alcohol causes 
cells to take in too much water and die, thus shrinking the 
prostate.

Boris Yeltsin survived an impeachment vote yesterday. The political 
events in Russia created uncertainty that forced international

IMF has tentatively agreed to lend Russia $4.5 billion but is 
waiting for parliament to pass a legislative package on economic 
policy before disbursing the first installment.

<HEADLINE> FBI Reports Drop in Crime Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Preliminary figures from the FBI indicate a  
decline in serious crime for the seventh consecutive year, the 
Justice Department said Sunday. Raw statistics for 1998 show a 7 
percent decline from the number of violent crimes and property 
offenses reported in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Decreases were reported across the board in both violent crimes  
-- murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault -- and property 
offenses -- burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft and arson, 
Justice officials said. Robberies fell 11 percent and vehicle 
thefts dropped 10 percent from 1997 levels, leading the way. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of murders declined 8 percent, while rape and  
aggravated assaults both were down by 5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Motor vehicle theft dropped 10 percent, and burglary and arson  
figures were each 7 percent lower, officials said. The number of 
larceny-thefts was down 6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department provided percentage changes but not  
overall totals for the number of each type of crime reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno said there was no single reason for  
the continuing decline, but gave the Clinton administration's 
anti-crime efforts much of the credit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a combination of many factors, including more police  
officers, common sense laws requiring background checks on gun 
purchasers, community policing, legislation banning assault 
weapons, practical partnerships between law enforcement and the 
communities they serve, more crime prevention programs and a host 
of effective comprehensive crime strategies,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, in a statement, called the seven-year trend  
``remarkable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``More community police on our streets and fewer guns in the  
hands of criminals have helped make our communities the safest they 
have been in a generation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have said there remains too much crime despite  
recent declines. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, when Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, unveiled a $17.4  
billion GOP crime bill in March, he said crime still is 
``significantly high by historical standards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, called on  
Congress to restore millions of dollars to Republican-backed crime 
fighting programs Clinton has proposed eliminating. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 17,000 city, county and state law enforcement agencies  
voluntarily submit data each year for the FBI's Uniform Crime 
Reporting Program. The totals are published yearly in a report 
called Crime in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Final figures are not available until this fall.  
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department said overall declines of 8 percent were  
reported by law enforcement agencies in northeastern and western 
states. The South reported decreases of 6 percent, and the Midwest 
4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of murders dropped in all regions, led by 11 percent  
declines in the Northeast and West. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the number of serious crimes fell in cities of all sizes.  
</P>
<P>
	Some gun control advocates said the figures show that efforts to  
tighten gun control are working, but more needs to be done. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we need to do is plug the loopholes that are still  
allowing criminals and children to get guns. Sensible people agree 
that if you have to go through a background check to buy a gun in a 
gun store, you should have to do the same at a gun show,'' said 
Naomi Paiss, a spokeswoman for Hangun Control Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI figures were announced two days after the Senate voted  
48-47 to place new restrictions on gun show sales despite 
Democratic concerns the legislation was filled with loopholes. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's acrimonious, partisan debate was spurred in part by  
last month's shooting at a Colorado high school. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing that shooting, the president said the government has ``a  
responsibility to support law enforcement officers and pass common 
sense gun legislation,'' such as ensuring background checks are 
required for purchases at gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Gun control is not the only reason crime has been going down,  
Ms. Paiss said, ``but no one can argue that the availability of the 
guns in this country is a prime factor in predicting the decline of 
the crime rate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But a group critical of gun control said crime has declined  
because of more aggressive law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that has much at all to do with gun control.  
What I think it has to do with is law enforcement getting serious 
about enforcing laws that are already on the books,'' said Robert 
Ricker, executive director of the American Shooting Sports Council. 
</P>
<P>
	``The crime rate is dropping across the board, not just gun  
crime, and I think that's because of enforcement,'' Ricker said.

<HEADLINE> NASA Prepares To Repair Telescope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Anxiety is high as NASA prepares for  
a rush repair job on its beloved Hubble Space Telescope. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubble's pointing system could die any day, halting all  
astronomical observations. So NASA is sending astronauts to the 
rescue in October, eight months earlier than they were supposed to 
go. 
</P>
<P>
	The spacewalkers will not only install new gyroscopes for  
precision pointing, they will replace Hubble's brain -- its main 
computer -- and patch Hubble's peeling skin. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's got this added drama to it,'' says Steven Smith, a  
veteran Hubble repairman who will lead the spacewalking team. 
``Anytime you're working toward a goal and it becomes more urgent, 
it's a little bit more exciting. 
</P>
<P>
	``But on the down side, something's wrong with this national  
asset. That's bad, and there are thousands of people in the United 
States who are going to have to work a lot harder than they were 
going to have to originally work in the next five months to get us 
ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NASA has never put together a shuttle mission so fast.  
</P>
<P>
	Smith and the three other astronauts assigned as spacewalkers  
have been training since August. But the flight crew was not chosen 
until March, a few days after NASA decided to split the originally 
scheduled June 2000 repair mission into two. 
</P>
<P>
	The first thing newly appointed commander Curtis Brown Jr. told  
his crew was: ``Grab ahold of something, because here we go! We 
only have 28 weeks to launch and we have all the training to get 
done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown is confident they'll be ready for an Oct. 14 liftoff  
aboard space shuttle Discovery. Three and possibly four spacewalks 
are planned for the nine-day mission. 
</P>
<P>
	``Out of seven people on board, we have 18 shuttle flights. We  
have a lot of experience on board,'' says Brown, an Air Force 
officer who will be making a record-tying sixth shuttle flight. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA managers as well as astronomers around the world are  
keeping their fingers crossed that the $2 billion telescope will 
keep operating until Brown and his crew get there. The mission 
cannot be pushed up any earlier, even if something else breaks. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's an edge (of tension), but we haven't shortcut anything  
so far,'' says John Campbell, NASA's associate director for the 
Hubble Space Telescope. ``That's why I'm unwilling to move it any 
earlier. Then I feel we'd have to start shortcutting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is with Hubble's gyroscopes, needed to aim the  
telescope and hold it steady as it scrutinizes the universe. Three 
of the six have failed because of corroded wires. One more failure 
and astronomical observations will cease, although the telescope 
itself will be safe in orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you believe the statisticians -- and I don't -- they say  
there's a 70 percent chance we'll make it to October,'' says Ed 
Weiler, head of NASA's space science program. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why Weiler and other scientists consider this an  
emergency mission. 
</P>
<P>
	Commander Brown bristles, however, at that description.  
</P>
<P>
	``Let me start my crusade right now,'' he tells an interviewer.  
``This is not an emergency mission, OK? This is a science mission 
and a repair mission and it's not an emergency mission. 
</P>
<P>
	``If another gyro fails right now as we speak, Hubble would go  
into a safe mode and the Hubble Telescope would be perfectly fine 
until we got up there. It's not going to hurt itself or anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For now, the three working gyroscopes show no signs of  
degradation. (Two are originals, launched with the telescope back 
in 1990.) But the wire corrosion that knocked out the three other 
gyroscopes seems to occur at random with little, if any, advance 
warning. 
</P>
<P>
	All six gyroscopes will be replaced with improved units during  
the upcoming mission. (They come two to a pack.) Smith and his 
spacewalking partners also will install a new computer, radio 
transmitter, guidance sensor and data recorder, and fix some of the 
tattered thermal insulation. 
</P>
<P>
	Weiler says it will be difficult work, though not nearly as  
demanding or stressful as it was when astronauts had to correct 
Hubble's blurred vision during the first repair mission in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	This will be repair mission No. 3.  
</P>
<P>
	Replacing the gyroscopes will be tricky because the chamber in  
which they're housed is cramped and holds extremely fragile 
instruments. Replacing the computer will be even trickier because 
of seven cables that the spacewalkers must connect with their 
gloved hands; each connector has 20 to 40 tiny pins. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are so many little things, that if we do wrong, can  
really damage the telescope,'' says Smith, who flew on the last 
Hubble repair mission in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The most formidable work -- installing new solar panels, an  
advanced camera and a cooling unit for an idle infrared camera -- 
won't be tackled until 2001. All that had been crammed, along with 
everything else, into the original June 2000 mission. A record six 
spacewalks were planned. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would have really driven us really hard'' to accomplish  
everything in a single mission, Smith says. ``So in some ways, 
there's a blessing with a silver lining here that we're actually 
going to have two flights go to Hubble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Splitting one repair mission into two will cost NASA an extra  
$125 million or so, Weiler says. But he's quick to point out it's 
money well spent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The scientific community is enamored with Hubble,'' Weiler  
says. ``I mean, we have enormous rejection ratios. That is, four or 
five proposals out of every six are rejected. So it's greatly 
oversubscribed. Any loss in scientific productivity, you're not 
earning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among Hubble's more recent discoveries: a galaxy 13 billion  
light-years away that's the most distant object ever detected, and 
dust rings around two remote stars that may have been 
gravitationally sculpted by planets. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA hopes to keep Hubble working until 2010. The last repair  
mission is slated for 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hubble has a limited lifetime. I mean, it's not going to be up  
there forever,'' Brown says. ``So every day, every month that it's 
not operating is a day of lost science that we could have.'' 
</P>

	``They dragged me back to the 2 o'clock show,'' Norman says.  
``It had gods, devils and Bible stories. I experienced what 
somebody might, in the face of a new religion -- I was scared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	People don't talk about ``Star Wars.'' They bow before it, in  
fear or in awe. Or they turn away, in disappointment or 
disinterest. Few refuse to acknowledge it. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1977, George Lucas did more than make history. ``Star Wars''  
went on to become the second-highest grossing movie of all time, 
behind only ``Titanic,'' and its two sequels would rank seventh and 
ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucas would also create a history, a modern mythology, populated  
by space adventurers called Luke and Han, a princess named Leia, 
the Wookiee co-pilot Chewbacca and droid sidekicks R2-D2 and C-3PO. 
His mythology influenced a generation in Hollywood and two 
generations of fans. It also became intertwined with his personal 
myth: reclusive filmmaker, Hollywood outsider, control freak. 
</P>
<P>
	The mythologies always threatened to swallow him, betray him,  
even today, as the world readies itself for a new religious 
experience with Wednesday's release of the prequel, ``Star Wars: 
Episode I -- The Phantom Menace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He urges restraint.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's only a movie. People should get a life,'' Lucas told a  
New York news conference this month. 
</P>
<P>
	``People should have a well-rounded life,'' he added. ``(The  
movies) are designed to make people think about the larger entities 
and the mysteries of life and hopefully raise questions. There 
definitely aren't enough answers in 'Star Wars' to constitute a 
religion. The point is to go and look through the religions and 
find something that has some answers for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Good and bad. Light and dark. A hero embarks on a journey of  
self-discovery. It doesn't get much more basic than that. Lucas's 
original ``Star Wars'' movie drew its Force from age-old tales. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing he's very good at, and I completely believe it's  
instinctual to him and not designed, is his ability to just lock 
onto the basic themes that people enjoy,'' says Dale Pollock, who 
wrote ``Skywalking: The Life and Films of George Lucas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pollock writes in a new chapter, added for an edition timed for  
release with ``The Phantom Menace,'' that while Lucas has 
``reinvented the entire process of movie making'' with computer 
technology, ``the point is not the technology, but the 
storytelling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, the technology didn't hurt. People of one generation  
remember where they were and what they were feeling the day 
President Kennedy was shot. People of another remember that first 
time they saw the space ship glide across the screen in the 
beginning of ``Star Wars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added to this was the soaring score by John Williams, music that  
``was definitely the turning point in my life,'' says ``Matrix'' 
composer, Don Davis, who recalls seeing the original ``Star Wars'' 
for this first time when he was studying music at UCLA. ``It gave 
everyone something to strive before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Movies just never looked like that before, never sounded like  
that before, never transported people to another time and place so 
completely. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think of the look of it, the feel of it, the emotion of it.  
You really got caught up in it,'' producer-screenwriter Dean Devlin 
says. ``I remember, I was 13 years old, at the Chinese Theater, 
opening day, and the whole audience started hissing when Darth 
Vader came on. I had never hissed a character in a movie in my 
life. But you knew this is the baddest guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Devlin, who himself grew up to create special effects-filled  
``popcorn movies'' like ``Godzilla'' and ``Independence Day,'' 
stresses that the allure of ``Star Wars'' was foremost in the 
storytelling, the mythological elements. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what will make or break this new one,'' he says.  
</P>
<P>
	And it is on this score that the early critics (many are holding  
their reviews until the release date) have been most unkind about 
``The Phantom Menace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A brilliant technology achievement ... but a less emotionally  
resonant exercise,'' said Variety. ``He doesn't seem to care about 
building a character,'' said Newsweek. ``Needed more human and less 
digital scale,'' said the New York Daily News. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucas saw them coming. At the news conference, before the  
notices started rolling in, he said his ``Star Wars'' films have 
``mostly been trashed one way or another'' and ``I certainly expect 
not to do well critically.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But there was more to his preemptive reply. It spoke to the  
power of myth -- to transport, and to suffocate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the fans have unfortunately got themselves into a  
situation both from the fact they've gotten much older and that the 
film is really for young people,'' he said. ``They have these 
amazing expectations that the film can't possibly live up to.''
