<HEADLINE> Mets Sluggers Stuggling Vs. Braves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Tom Glavine broke out an oldie but a goody to  
explain how Atlanta has pulled off the ultimate vanishing act, with 
the New York Mets' 3-4-5 hitters serving as the props. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a reason for that saying, `Good pitching beats good  
hitting,''' said Glavine, the Braves' starter in Game 3 of the NL 
championship series Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Good pitching? So far, this has been total domination of a trio  
that combined to hit .301 with 91 homers and 340 RBIs during the 
regular season. In the NLCS, Mike Piazza, John Olerud and Robin 
Ventura are 1-for-21 with a one RBI -- and that on a groundout. 
</P>
<P>
	``Simply put, we're just making good pitches,'' Game 4 starter  
John Smoltz said. ``Piazza's the scariest right-handed hitter in 
the game. Especially when he's going to right-center and right 
field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, Piazza and his cohorts are going to the dugout.  
</P>
<P>
	After batting .303 with 40 homers and 124 RBIs, Piazza is  
0-for-6 in the series, providing the group's lone RBI with a 
shattered-bat grounder in Game 1 that could have been an 
inning-ending double play. Third baseman Chipper Jones bobbled the 
ball and could only get one out. 
</P>
<P>
	At least Piazza has an excuse: a sore thumb caused him to miss  
two games in the division series. The other two have no one to 
blame but themselves -- and Atlanta's magnificent pitching staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Olerud (.298, 19, 96) is 1-for-8 and has struck out twice  
against Braves closer John Rocker. Ventura (.301, 32, 120) is 
hitless in seven at-bats, with two of his three strikeouts also 
coming against Rocker. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some credit has to be given to the pitching strategy and  
execution,'' said Smoltz, who picked up the first save of his 
career in Game 2. ``All it is is execution. Any hitter will tell 
you that great pitching will get them out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's not like this is anything unusual for the Braves. Just ask  
Barry Bonds, who was taking futile swings against the Atlanta 
pitchers way back in 1991 and '92 when the Braves began their run 
of eight straight appearances in the NL championship series. 
</P>
<P>
	In two seven-game losses to Atlanta, Bonds combined to hit .200  
with no homers and two RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are pitching us tough,'' Piazza said. ``They keep the  
ball away and move it around in the strike zone. But I have had 
some good pitches to hit, but I just missed them. I have to take 
advantage of those opportunities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As recently as the division series, the Braves shut down one of  
baseball's most potent combinations. Houston's Killer B's -- Jeff 
Bagwell, Craig Biggio and Derek Bell -- hit only .143 (5-of-35) with 
no RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been on top of our game for most of the playoffs,''  
Smoltz said. ``When you get to the playoffs, a guy on first is a 
rally. In the regular season, it's just a guy on first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Braves manager Bobby Cox said he'll use his usual right-handed  
lineup against New York starter Al Leiter, which means Brian Hunter 
will start at first and Walt Weiss at shortstop. The Braves worked 
out late Thursday afternoon at Shea Stadium after flying into windy 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of flights were canceled,'' Cox said. ``But it wasn't  
that bumpy on the way in. It was a good flight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only bumps in this series belong to the New York hitters.  
</P>
<P>
	``If you don't think things are going to change, you come in  
feeling all defeated,'' Ventura said. ``We feel like we are going 
to get out of it.''

<HEADLINE> Rodriguez: If Traded, I Won't Sign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The Seattle Mariners can trade him, Alex  
Rodriguez said, but he won't sign a contract extension with his new 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez, 24, one of the top shortstops in the American League,  
can become a free agent after next season. So can Seattle's other 
superstar, center fielder Ken Griffey Jr. Unlike Griffey, however, 
Rodriguez does not have enough years of major league service to 
exercise a veto over a trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle likely will explore trade options if it cannot come to  
terms with Rodriguez, but any deal would be complicated by his vow 
not to sign an extension with his new club. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez said the only team he would consider signing with this  
winter is Seattle, and that would come only if the team made a 
number of moves. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing they can do is go out and make us a  
championship ballclub,'' he said Wednesday from his home in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what I've said all along. If they go out and get all  
the pieces, sure, I'd be more than willing to sign with the 
Mariners. I've always said that's where I want to be under the 
right conditions. And the right conditions are having a 
championship ballclub like Texas, the Yankees and Cleveland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mariners have made offers to both Griffey and Rodriguez that  
would make them the highest paid players in baseball, new team 
chairman Howard Lincoln said last month. Further details have not 
been released. 
</P>
<P>
	The team said it wants to sign Rodriguez by mid-November, but he  
wasn't committing to that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not even close,'' he said. ``I haven't even thought about  
baseball the last couple of weeks. I'm just focusing on working 
out, getting my knee ready for another big league year. I'm not 
concerned about my contract or any of that stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez finished the season hitting.285, with 42 home runs and  
111 RBIs, despite missing five weeks early on after knee surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez said free agency could be appealing to him.  
</P>
<P>
	``Until you're a free agent, you have to just bite your tongue  
and play hard,'' he said. ``I've never questioned anything the 
Mariners have done. I just go out and play hard. But you only have 
the ball in your court one or two times in your career. You have to 
stand up for what you believe in. That's what I'm doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey also hit .285, with 48 homers and 134 RBIs in 606  
at-bats -- 104 more than Rodriguez.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Mixed; Dow Up 54.45 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks stumbled to a mixed finish Thursday as  
strong corporate earnings and soaring bond yields prevented 
investors from charting any clear course. 
</P>
<P>
	At the close of a mercurial session on Wall Street, the Dow  
Jones industrial average was up 54.45 at 10,286.61. The Dow was 
lower for much of the morning, but also rose as much as 110 points 
above Wednesday's close before giving up ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators ended mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
fell 2.13 to 1,283.42, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 5.57 to 
2,806.84. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks initially fell Thursday after the Commerce Department  
reported what appeared to be moderate September retail sales. Total 
retail sales rose to a seasonally adjusted $253.4 billion, a gain 
of just 0.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But excluding the volatile automobile category, retail sales  
rose a brisk 0.6 percent. Many analysts were expecting a 0.5 
percent gain. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, the Labor Department said the number of  
Americans filing for unemployment benefits last week fell by an 
unexpected 29,000 to 285,000. Economists believe jobless claims 
levels under 300,000 are an indication of an extremely tight labor 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	Both reports heightened fears that the Federal Reserve will  
raise interest rates for the third time this year in an effort to 
keep inflation from escalating. The Fed's Open Market Committee 
will hold its next meeting on Nov. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Fears of inflation sent the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond  
soaring to 6.32 percent, its highest level since Oct. 1997. Bond 
yields above 6.25 percent are viewed as a very appealing 
alternative to stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bonds are putting tremendous pressure on the market,'' said  
Charles Pradilla, chief investment strategist at SG Cowen 
Securities. ``If bonds weren't acting so badly, we could have had a 
powerful rally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, many analysts had anticipated that a handful of robust  
earnings reports could lift stocks from a two-day slump that 
knocked 415 points off the Dow. Instead, the good news provided 
pockets of strength in an overall weak market. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing accounted for much of the Dow's advance. Shares rose 3 1/8  
to 43 5/8 after the company said third-quarter profits rose 37 percent 
as its commercial aircraft division continued to recover from 
costly production problems. Boeing earned 52 cents per share in the 
quarter, beating analysts' estimates by 3 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple Computer soared 9 5/32 to 73 3/16 after releasing earnings  
that beat analysts' expectations, helping to contain the losses of 
the technology-dominated Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
	But General Motors slipped 1/8 to 65 after reporting earnings of  
$1.33 a share, compared with analysts' predictions of $1.24 a 
share. 
</P>
<P>
	And investors continued their pattern of punishing companies for  
any measure of bad news. 
</P>
<P>
	Unisys plunged 15 11/16 to 26 9/16 after announcing that  
earnings increased 72 percent from the third quarter of 1998. The 
market focused on the fact that the company's revenues grew just 4 
percent, below the 8 percent anticipated by analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	Gail Dudack, chief equity strategist at Warburg Dillon Read,  
said scattered reports of earnings weakness have pushed investors 
back into the pessimism that drove stocks lower in late September 
and early October, preventing the market from building on last 
week's solid gains. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought the oversold rebound would continue this week as  
earnings season begins,'' she said. ``Instead, inflation fears and 
disappointing earnings results put the market into a tailspin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Traders suggested the market's volatility was sparked by the  
promise of a ``double witching'' day on Friday. Quarterly stock and 
index options expire, forcing traders to adjust their portfolios. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 8-to-5 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange. NYSE volume totaled 1.06 billion 
shares, compared with 996.45 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies slipped 0.01 to  
419.31. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.2 percent as  
investors welcomed news of a merger between Sumitomo Bank and 
Sakura Bank, a deal that will create the world's second-largest 
bank. 
</P>
<P>
	In Europe, Germany's DAX index fell 1.4 percent, Britain's FT-SE  
100 fell 1.2 percent, and France's CAC-40 closed 0.4 percent lower.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Denounces Test Ban Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton promised the United States  
won't abandon its commitment to the nuclear test ban treaty and 
said today that the country will continue to refrain from testing, 
as it has done since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton accused the Republican-led Senate of ``reckless  
partisanship'' in rejecting the international pact and appealed to 
nuclear-capable countries not to use the vote as an excuse to 
resume or begin testing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Senate majority has turned its back on 50 years of  
American leadership against the spread of weapons of mass 
destruction,'' Clinton told an East Room news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	On a largely party line vote, the Senate defeated the  
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty late Wednesday, 51-48. Only four 
Senate Republicans voted for the treaty. The United States thus 
became the first nuclear power to specifically reject the 
154-nation agreement on ending nuclear weapons testing. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., speaking immediately  
after Clinton's news conference, defended the Senate action and 
said ``no senator was pressured to vote any way but his or her 
conscience.'' He accused Clinton of ``revisionist history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the international condemnation that followed the  
Senate vote, Clinton said he had already appealed to some U.S. 
allies ``not to overreact ... stay with us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said that the Senate vote does not end his advocacy for the  
landmark treaty and that he would try to revive it. 
</P>
<P>
	Noting that the treaty, even though rejected, could be brought  
up again, Clinton said: ``The treaty is still on the Senate 
calendar. We have to keep moving forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I will continue to do all I can to make the case to the  
Senate,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will not let yesterday's partisanship stand as the final  
word on the test ban treaty,'' Clinton added. 
</P>
<P>
	As Clinton denounced the vote, other Democrats pledged to make  
the Senate rejection a political issue for 2000. Republican 
opponents of the pact call it fatally flawed and dispute that the 
vote will command much campaign attention. 
</P>
<P>
	He made a special appeal to countries that have nuclear weapons  
already -- mentioning India and Pakistan -- or would like to develop 
them, not to misinterpret the Senate vote as U.S. support for a 
resumption of testing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I call on Russia, China, Britain, France and all other  
countries to continue to refrain from testing,'' Clinton said. 
``When all is said and done I have no doubt that the United States 
will ratify this treaty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton criticized ``the signs of a new isolationism among some  
of the opponents of the treaty.'' He said these views are reflected 
in Congress' delinquency on U.N. dues and a ``woefully inadequate 
budget for foreign affairs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Clinton denounced the vote, other Democrats pledged to make  
the Senate rejection a political issue for 2000. Republican 
opponents of the pact call it fatally flawed and dispute that the 
vote will command much campaign attention. 
</P>
<P>
	But few on either side of the political aisle expected to see  
another vote on the treaty anytime soon in the 
Republican-controlled Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hard-line Republicans irresponsibly forced a vote'' on the  
treaty despite his own pleas that the Senate delay a vote and 
appeals by Senate Democrats and some moderate Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was partisan politics of the worst kind, because it was  
so blatant, and because of the risks it poses to the safety of the 
American people and the world,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats claimed polls show most Americans favor such a ban --  
first proposed by President Dwight Eisenhower in 1958 and endorsed, 
in various forms, by every president since. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect that this should be and will be a national issue  
next year in the presidential elections,'' said Senate Minority 
Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D. 
</P>
<P>
	Wasting little time, Vice President Al Gore jumped right in. In  
his first television advertisement of the 2000 presidential race, 
Gore pledges to make a campaign issue out of the defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	``This vote goes against the tide of history,'' Gore says in the  
ad to air this week in Iowa, New Hampshire and nationally on CNN, 
according to a script released by the campaign. Furthermore, Gore 
said Wednesday night that he would resubmit the treaty if he wins 
the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush has condemned  
the treaty, as have Elizabeth Dole and the two Senate Republicans 
who are presidential hopefuls: John McCain of Arizona and Orrin 
Hatch of Utah; as well as Sen. Bob Smith, Ind-N.H. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, one of a small band of conservatives who managed to block  
efforts by moderate Republicans to put off a vote, said after 
Wednesday night's vote that he wasn't surprised Democrats would 
seek to make the rejection a big campaign issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, that's the way it is in politics,'' he said. He  
said the vote was the right course. ``It's better to be definitive 
than to delay,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the Senate majority leader, said he  
doubted that Democrats could turn the Senate rejection into a 
winning campaign issue because ``this one is not a close call.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He portrayed the treaty as badly flawed and said, ``The American  
people are smarter than they (Democrats) give them credit for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents argued the treaty was not verifiable and would not  
stop the nuclear ambitions of North Korea and Iran. Further, they 
argued it would harm efforts to maintain the safety and reliability 
of the U.S. nuclear arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time the Senate has ever rejected an arms  
control treaty and the first time any treaty had been rejected 
since an unpopular agreement dealing with airline overflight rights 
and exposure to international lawsuits had been rejected in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate had been closely watched around the world by other  
nuclear powers. 
</P>
<P>
	``With this vote tonight, the world becomes a more dangerous  
place,'' declared Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, the senior Democrat 
on the Senate Armed Services Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Levin suggested the reaction would not only make it easier for  
other nations to resume or initiate testing, but that it could make 
it less likely that Russia would ratify an existing arms control 
treaty -- START II -- presently before its parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	After sitting on the treaty for two years, Lott and Senate  
Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms, R-N.C., suddenly 
brought the measure to the floor for a vote, knowing that it would 
be rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the treaty was signed by 154 nations, including the  
United States, it has been ratified by only 26 of the 44 
nuclear-capable states that must approve it to put it into force.

<HEADLINE> Apple Turns Eighth Straight Profit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Apple Computer Inc. said production of its  
hot new lines of business and personal computers is back on track 
following a series of snafus that trimmed its fourth-quarter 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Its stock shot up 12 percent this morning on the  
stronger-than-expected financial results. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cupertino-based company on Wednesday reported net income of  
$111 million, or 63 cents a share, for its fourth quarter ended 
Sept. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	But excluding a gain of $37 million from an investment and other  
one-time factors, Apple earned $90 million, or 51 cents a share -- a 
drop of 15 percent from last year's net profit of $106 million, or 
68 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the computer maker skated past analysts' deflated  
forecasts for a fourth-quarter operating profit of 45 cents a 
share, according to a survey by First Call/Thompson Financial. 
Apple shares rose $7.71 5/8 to $71.75 a share this morning on the 
Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourth-quarter revenue fell 14 percent to $1.34 billion -- down  
from $1.56 billion in the year-ago period -- after Apple could not 
fill orders for its new high-end line of G4 computers due to delays 
in chip supplies from Motorola. The company had warned in late 
September that the shortage would put a drag on sales and profits. 
</P>
<P>
	To help address the order backlog, Apple announced Wednesday  
that it would delay the launch of the fastest G4 model until early 
next year so it can better match demand with chip availability from 
Motorola. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also announced a contract with IBM to produce chips  
for the G4, although the new supplies will not be available until 
the middle of next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Demand for all of our products has been incredibly strong. We  
feel confident we'll be caught up on meeting the demand for the G4 
this quarter,'' said Fred Anderson, Apple's chief financial 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Jobs, Apple's cofounder and interim chief executive,  
stressed the strong demand for the recently retooled iMac computer 
line and the new iBook laptop. Apple has received 250,000 orders 
for the new iMac, announced just a week ago, and 300,000 orders for 
its iBook, introduced last month, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the company likely will not be able to fill all of the  
iBook orders until sometime next year, Anderson said, citing the 
earthquake in Taiwan and unexpected production problems. 
</P>
<P>
	For the full fiscal year, Apple posted a net profit of $601  
million, or $3.61 a share, nearly double the prior year's income of 
$309 million, or $2.10 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue for the just-ended year totaled $6.1 billion, up from  
$5.9 billion in the prior 12-month period. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple said it expects gross profit margins to shrink in the  
current quarter because of rising memory hip costs that come amid a 
shortage in the industry. Income, however, should rise.

</P>
<P>
	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Bantamweight boxer Carlos Barreto died  
from head injuries Tuesday, four days after he was knocked out 
during a bout. He was 23. 
</P>
<P>
	Barreto, an interim World Boxing Association champion, fell into  
a coma Saturday after he was hit by fellow Venezuelan Jose Luis 
Valbuena in the 10th round of a match for the Latin American super 
bantamweight title. 
</P>

	Barreto was ranked No. 5 by the WBA. He had a 9-3-1 record with  
nine knockouts as a professional boxer since 1996.

	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- Frederick C. Belen, a former deputy U.S.  
postmaster general during the Johnson administration who helped 
initiate ZIP codes, died Wednesday. He was 85 and had Parkinson's 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Belen was assistant postmaster general for operations before  
being named to the second-highest job at what then was the Post 
Office Department. 
</P>
<P>
	He chaired the committee whose studies helped initiate and  
oversee automation of the Post Office, using ZIP -- Zoning 
Improvement Plan -- code numbers for towns and cities and a network 
of regional distribution centers. 
</P>
<P>
	Before joining the Post Office, Belen, a Lansing, Mich., native,  
had been an aide to two Democratic Michigan congressmen, Reps. 
Andrew J. Transue and George D. O'Brien.

<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Maj. Gen. William Tait Campbell, the British Army  
officer who planned air operations for the Allied invasion of Italy 
during World War II, died Friday. He was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell later served with the British command in Washington  
D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	As head of operations for the 1st Airborne Division, Campbell  
planned the British parachute and glider-borne assault on Sicily in 
July 1943 that combined with the U.S. Army's 82nd Airborne Division 
to pave the way for the sea landings by the American and British 
armies. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first large-scale Allied airborne invasion of the  
war. 
</P>
<P>
	He subsequently headed the newly formed Allied Airborne Army in  
August 1944, and after the war served at British Army headquarters 
in Washington D.C. For his wartime service he was designated a 
Companion of the British Empire, and awarded the U.S. Bronze Star. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1953, Campbell took over command of the army's senior  
regiment, the Royal Scots, before moving on to teach at the Royal 
Naval War College in Greenwich, England. He served as an 
administrative officer with the 17th Gurkha Division in Malaya 
before being appointed deputy quartermaster-general in the Ministry 
of Defense in 1964. 
</P>

Chemical Bank and the U.S. Golf Association, died Monday. He was 
104. 
</P>
<P>
	So legendary was his knowledge of the rules of golf and his  
devotion to the game, that in 1995 the USGA designated the Ike 
Grainger Award to recognize people who have volunteered for the 
USGA for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Grainger was chairman of the USGA committee that in 1951

<HEADLINE> FBI Cameras May Have Waco Footage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The FBI had closed-circuit cameras surrounding the  
Branch Davidian compound that may have captured footage of the 1993 
standoff never seen by the public, The Dallas Morning News reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Government documents obtained by the newspaper show that at  
least five FBI agents were sent to the compound near Waco to 
maintain closed-circuit cameras during the standoff and 
specifically on April 19, the day federal agents launched an 
assault against the compound. 
</P>
<P>
	Later that day, the Davidian compound erupted in flames. About  
80 members of the cult, including leader David Koresh, died. Law 
enforcement officials insist the Davidians started the fire. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's conduct at Waco has come under renewed scrutiny  
from Congress and a special counsel appointed by Attorney General 
Janet Reno following the FBI's belated admission that its agents 
fired potentially incendiary tear-gas canisters in the hours before 
flames consumed the Davidians' retreat. 
</P>
<P>
	The videotapes may help to answer some of the lingering  
questions. The FBI has long denied that its agents fired any shots 
during the siege, and bureau officials have said rules of 
engagement did not permit deadly force against unarmed Davidians. 
</P>
<P>
	The records obtained by the newspaper contain written statements  
from FBI agents and technicians that recordings were made, even 
though no such videotape from the surveillance cameras has ever 
been released. 
</P>
<P>
	``CCTV (closed-circuit TV) monitoring sites ... were all around  
the compound,'' one agent stated in a June 1993 interview detailed 
in a three-page document. ``This enabled observers to see 
everything that was going on at the compound without showing 
themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional investigators refused to reveal details about the  
cameras because the matter involves government secrets, the News 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until that information is declassified, we cannot discuss  
it,'' said Mark Corallo, spokesman for the House Government Reform 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	An FBI spokesman also refused to comment, saying he would need  
to look into the matter first. A Justice Department spokesman did 
not return calls.

<HEADLINE> Source Says Starr Will Step Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With his five-year, $47 million investigation  
of the Clintons winding down, Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr 
will formally step aside next week and be replaced by one of his 
assistants, Robert Ray, sources familiar with Starr's plans said 
Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray, a federal prosecutor who joined Starr's office early this  
year, was selected by a panel of three federal appeals court judges 
to succeed the controversial special prosecutor, the sources told 
The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The judges, who interviewed several of Starr's deputies, have  
not issued a formal order yet, but they told the prosecutor's 
office of their plans this week, the sources said, speaking on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	That cleared the way for Starr, who has hinted for months of his  
desire to step down, to return to his private law practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray will try to wrap up the wide-ranging investigation that has  
ranged from allegedly fraudulent land deals in Arkansas to 
impeachment charges of presidential perjury and obstruction of 
justice in the Monica Lewinsky scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC News first reported the selection of Ray, who came to  
Starr's office after working for Independent Counsel Donald Smaltz. 
Smaltz's office unsuccessfully prosecuted former Agriculture 
Secretary Mike Espy but won a number of convictions against 
companies and individuals who had provided gifts to the agriculture 
secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's office has two pending investigative matters:  
</P>
<P>
	--An alleged attempt to influence the testimony of presidential  
accuser Kathleen Willey. 
</P>
<P>
	--Possible false statements regarding Hillary Rodham Clinton's  
role in the purge of White House travel office employees. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Starr's successor must produce a final report on  
the Whitewater scandal -- a document that could prove to be a 
political headache for Mrs. Clinton if she follows through on plans 
to run next year for a U.S. Senate seat from New York. 
</P>
<P>
	During Starr's tenure, his office convicted 14 people, including  
the Clintons' Whitewater business partners, Jim and Susan McDougal, 
and then-Arkansas Gov. Jim Guy Tucker, who resigned his office. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's investigation of the Lewinsky scandal, the president's  
affair and subsequent cover-up, led to the first presidential 
impeachment since 1868. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's office declined to comment Thursday night.

	Clinton Denounces Test Ban Vote  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite the Senate's defeat of a nuclear test  
ban treaty, President Clinton said today that the United States 
will refrain from testing, as it has done since 1992. The vote 
makes the United States the first nuclear power to specifically 
reject the 154-nation agreement on ending nuclear weapons testing. 
Clinton accused the Republican-led Senate of ``reckless 
partisanship'' in rejecting the international pact and appealed to 
nuclear-capable countries not to use the vote as an excuse to 
resume or begin testing. Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the Senate 
majority leader, said he doubted that Democrats could turn the 
Senate rejection into a winning campaign issue because ``this one 
is not a close call.'' 

</P>
<P>
	Nations Dismayed by Treaty Vote  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Russia accused the United States today of  
undermining world stability with the Senate defeat of a 
multinational nuclear test ban treaty. China, another nuclear 
giant, called the rejection deeply worrying. Around the globe, 
nations charged Washington with sending out a wrong and dangerous 
signal. India hinted it may take its time before signing on to the 
treaty. In Pakistan -- India's uneasy neighbor and fellow nuclear 
power -- the military leaders who seized control two days ago had 
nothing to say. But a spokesman for Pakistani opposition leader 
Benazir Bhutto said it is now virtually certain that neither 
Pakistan nor India will sign the treaty.

	Hurricane Irene Approaches W. Cuba  
</P>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- Cuban authorities evacuated tens of thousands of  
people this morning as Hurricane Irene dumped heavy rains across 
parts of the Caribbean island. The storm, expected to creep north 
toward Florida, was already battering Miami with rain and forcing 
tourists to leave the Keys. Although still a weak hurricane, Irene 
worried forecasters because it could gain strength after it crosses 
Cuba, especially if it spends a long time over water. The hurricane 
was expected to hit the Tampa area by Sunday. Tourists have been 
advised to leave the Florida Keys, and heavy rains were blamed for 
causing some traffic accidents in Miami today. 

</P>
<P>
	FAA Urged To Untangle Air Traffic  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's air travelers face more delays  
unless the Federal Aviation Administration takes quick action to 
untangle traffic jams in the skies, according to a report released 
today by air carriers. But the FAA said it is moving as fast as it 
can to straighten out a complex and outdated system plagued by 
weather problems this year. 

</P>
<P>
	Pakistan's Rule Deeply Uncertain  
</P>
<P>
	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Soldiers locked the gates of  
parliament Thursday on the eve of its first scheduled session since 
the army overthrew the elected government. Coup leader Gen. Pervaiz 
Musharraf met his senior commanders, but a spokesman said no 
decision was reached on what form of administration will replace 
the ousted government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. Sharif, who 
has been under house arrest in the capital, was reportedly moved to 
Lahore, where troops maintained a 24-hour guard on his family home. 

</P>
<P>
	Blair Campaigns in Favor of EU  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair kicked of a  
campaign today backing close cooperation with the Eurpoean Union. 
But critics cast the move as a disguised drive to persuade Britons 
to adopt the EU's common currency, the euro. Blair made only one 
reference in his speech to the euro, saying it would be ``madness'' 
to rule out adopting the EU's single currency, which officially 
went into use in 11 European countries on Jan 1. He plans to call a 
referendum on adopting the euro, probably in about 2001, if 
economic conditions look right.

	Dow Up 65.22

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed in volatile trading today as  
soaring bond yields and strong corporate earnings prevented 
investors from choosing any clear course. Just before the close, 
the Dow Jones industrial average was up 65.22 at 10,297.38. 
Decliners on the New York Stock Exchange led advancers 1,762-1,182. 
The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 0.28 at 2,800.99.

	Tigers Replace Parrish With Garner

	DETROIT (AP) -- The Detroit Tigers replaced manager Larry Parrish  
with former Milwaukee Brewers manager Phil Garner, seeking a new 
direction for a team headed next season to a new ballpark. Garner 
agreed to a four-year deal. Terms of the contract were not 
available. The Tigers offered Parrish the opportunity to remain in 
the organization, the club said. It didn't say if Parrish accepted. 
Parrish said the last time he talked to a team official was a 
couple of days before the season ended.

<HEADLINE> FBI, Militia Members Exchange Views </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLOOMFIELD, Ind. (AP) -- Three FBI agents and six militia  
members, face to face -- but there was no confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, both sides sat down and tried to discuss ways to foster  
better relationships between the two groups. It's part of a 
national attempt to curtail animosity that has resulted in 
sometimes violent battles between anti-government groups and law 
enforcement in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think what we need to do is realize that we're all human  
beings and we all want to do what's morally right, though we may 
have different ideas on how to do that,'' said Albert King, a 
member of the Greene County Militia. 
</P>
<P>
	Acting on orders from FBI Director Louis Freeh and Attorney  
General Janet Reno, agents in the nation's 56 field offices have 
been trying to open lines of communication with members of militia 
groups in their areas. The program was established just weeks after 
the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City was bombed 
on April 19, 1995, killing 168 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wednesday meeting between FBI agents from Indianapolis and  
Indiana militias was the second in three months. 
</P>
<P>
	At the first meeting, which took place at the FBI's Indianapolis  
field office in August, a couple of the 10 or so militia members in 
attendance made conspiracy accusations and other inflammatory 
comments. 
</P>
<P>
	There was none of that at the Bloomfield meeting, which took  
place in a public park shelterhouse. The town is 65 miles southwest 
of Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI Agent Doug Garrison assured the militia members that his  
colleagues ``aren't hiding behind every tree,'' watching their 
every move. 
</P>
<P>
	Roger Stalcup, a Bloomfield resident and commander of the  
Southern Indiana Regional Militia, said members of his group do not 
advocate illegal activity, and if they learn of any such plan they 
would be the first to report it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the FBI has demonstrated good faith in coming to the  
table and talking with us,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Alabama Coach Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) -- Alabama assistant football coach Ronnie  
Cottrell was suspended for Saturday's game against No. 22 
Mississippi as part of a ticket-fixing investigation, while wide 
receiver Shamari Buchanan was cleared to return. 
</P>
<P>
	Cottrell received the one-game suspension for helping Buchanan  
with a speeding ticket, coach Mike DuBose said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cottrell said the favor he requested and got for Buchanan was  
``a minor NCAA violation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The university announced the suspension following a review of  
the dismissed ticket, which an Alabama official said Buchanan has 
paid, and after consulting with the Southeastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	DuBose told The Birmingham News in Thursday's editions that  
Cottrell ``made a mistake and made a phone call'' on Buchanan's 
behalf. 
</P>
<P>
	The ticket was issued Jan. 6 in Calhoun County by a state  
trooper, law enforcement officers who are under the Department of 
Public Safety. The acting director of the agency, Mike Sullivan, 
resigned under pressure Oct. 1 after the governor was questioned 
about ticket-fixing favors in Sullivan's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Sullivan is also a longtime security escort for the Alabama  
football coach at games. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the scheme of things, with all the things I deal with on  
the NCAA Infractions Committee, this is not a major issue,'' said 
Gene Marsh, the university's faculty athletic representative, told 
the News. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan was held out of No. 11 Alabama's game against Florida  
while university officials investigated whether the ticket 
dismissal was an extra benefit in violation of NCAA rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Marsh said the university sent the NCAA proof that Buchanan paid  
the ticket. He said the dollar cost was ``in the 90s.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cottrell's suspension was only for Saturday. He was to continue  
coaching in practice and return to his regular duties immediately 
following the game, the university said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cottrell said he did not know when he requested the favor for  
Buchanan. He declined to discuss the request but said. ``The NCAA 
has a rule that says no one can do anything as far as a legal 
matter for a player. I guess what I did constitutes that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan, a reserve receiver from Atlanta, was charged with  
traveling 87 mph in a 70 mph zone. The charge was dropped April 19, 
according to records obtained by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Alabama associate athletics director Mal Moore and linebackers  
coach Jeff Rouzie earlier told the Birmingham News they had tickets 
fixed.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Georgetown Coach to TBS, TNT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Former Georgetown coach John Thompson, who resigned abruptly  
during the early part of last season, has joined Turner Sports as 
an NBA analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, who has not ruled out returning to coaching in the  
future, will work a full slate of games this season for both TNT 
and TBS. He replaces Doc Rivers, who left the cable network to 
coach the Orlando Magic. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson might be teamed with Kevin Harlan.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm totally committed to doing it,'' Thompson said Thursday.  
``I have been looking to do something that kept me close to 
basketball, but this isn't something that I planned. They called me 
to audition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson stunned college basketball in January when he resigned,  
citing personal reasons related to his marriage. His name has come 
up for various NBA coaching jobs since. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a personal thing as to why I got out of coaching,''  
Thompson said. ``I was going through a divorce that is pretty much 
resolved now. As I said then, I was resigning -- not retiring. ... I 
didn't stop coaching because I didn't like it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, enshrined in the Basketball Hall of Fame on Oct. 1,  
coached 27 seasons at Georgetown, compiling a 596-239 record. He 
led the Hoyas to 24 straight postseason appearances and three NCAA 
Final Fours, including a national championship in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the Boston Celtics' backup center for Bill Russell on the  
1965 and 1966 NBA championship teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are several players who I coached and have relationships  
with that are key players in the NBA,'' Thompson said. ``I'm around 
the game a lot and I'm going to have fun with this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among those he coached who are currently in the league are Allen  
Iverson, Alonzo Mourning and Patrick Ewing. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson has served as an analyst for Turner Sports' annual NBA  
draft coverage since 1997. He also is the host of a sports talk 
radio program in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``John brings with him nearly four decades of basketball  
experience and an understanding of the game and its players that is 
unparalleled,'' said Turner executive producer Mike Pearl.

<HEADLINE> Disputes Arise Over Charter Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Decades-old orders to end school desegregation  
-- meant to help poor, minority families gain equal access to a 
quality education -- are being targeted by those same parents who 
now see charter schools, vouchers and other education experiments 
as their best hope. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents and other charter school advocates, tired of waiting for  
the progress promised by desegregation, are joining in lawsuits to 
end court-ordered actions pending in 20 states. 
</P>
<P>
	``As I see it, the children should go where their parents want  
them to go,'' said Greta Ridley, 65, of Baton Rouge, La., who is 
raising her grandson. The 10-year-old had repeated fourth grade at 
a school Ridley didn't like. 
</P>
<P>
	Families in her neighborhood were relieved when they first  
learned of the opening of a charter school. But they became 
disheartened to learn the school, which would be 80 percent black, 
could run afoul of a court order requiring racially balanced 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
	She felt lucky to get him into another charter school this year.  
But many more families are waiting, since Justice Department 
opposition delayed the opening of The United Charter School, 
scheduled to move into a vacant inner city mall this year in a 
predominantly black neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	Clint Bolick of the Institute for Justice, a pro-school choice  
Washington law advocacy group, said the group planned to file suit 
next month, representing families in Baton Rouge and elsewhere who 
want to challenge desegregation orders to protect their charter 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``The formation of an all-black school should not thwart the  
creation of these schools if the school is affirmatively chosen by 
parents,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department has blocked just three of nation's 1,700  
charter schools, officials told Congress on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	A charter school, created by a group of teachers, community  
members or parents, is free of most state laws and regulations. A 
charter outlines its goals and procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the schools in Lufkin, Texas; Oktibbeha County, Miss.;  
and Georgetown County, S.C., most charters -- which are small -- 
usually don't disturb segregation patterns, said Anita Hodgkiss, a 
deputy assistant attorney general. She and others testified before 
the House Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on constitutional 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Desegregation orders nationwide could only affect about 50 more  
charters, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, parents have the impression the department ``plans to  
do everything in its power to prevent the opening of certain 
charter schools,'' said Andy Kopplin, education policy adviser to 
Louisiana Gov. Mike Foster. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Baton Rouge case, Hodgkiss said, the 650-student United  
Charter School could have in effect added another ``one-race'' 
school to a system that doesn't have the financial resources to 
desegregate 50 of its 97 schools. So the Justice Department 
declined to help the school get court approval to open. 
</P>
<P>
	The school's fate depends on whether local board officials  
decide it's worth the time and money to go to court on its behalf. 
</P>
<P>
	Charters are not a panacea for low-income minority families,  
civil rights advocates say. 
</P>
<P>
	``These schools must not be allowed to operate without  
consideration to the damage it may cause to the fragile 
desegregation implementation in the East Baton Rouge Parish school 
system,'' said Victor Kirk, city businessman who once worked for 
the district and directed the Baton Rouge-branch of the civil 
rights watchdog Association of Community Organizations for Reform 
Now. ``Charters must not be insulated from failure nor particularly 
removed from public scrutiny.''

<HEADLINE> Pataki Outlines New Emissions Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Gov. George Pataki on Thursday unveiled a  
plan to force dramatic smokestack reductions from New York power 
plants that contribute to smog and acid rain. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics said the plan could raise the cost of electricity.  
</P>
<P>
	Under new regulations to be issued by the state Department of  
Environmental Conservation, power plants in New York will have to 
meet the previously planned 2003 summer-only reduction of nitrogen 
oxide emissions year-round and drop sulfur dioxide emissions to 50 
percent below federal requirements. The reductions would be phased 
in by 2007. 
</P>
<P>
	Sulfur dioxide is the main cause of acid rain and nitrogen  
oxides cause smog and also contribute to acid rain. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists cheered Pataki, saying New York would be  
leading the nation's fight against acid rain and smog. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think any other state has gone this far,'' said Larry  
Shapiro of the New York Public Interest Research Group. 
</P>
<P>
	Pataki and his Public Service Commission Chairwoman, Maureen  
Helmer, said the proposed changes should not cause electric prices 
to go up. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe any potential costs associated with these new  
standards can be offset through increased competition in the 
generation sector and further energy tax reductions,'' Helmer said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Stu Silbergleit, executive vice president of the Energy  
Association of New York State, said New Yorkers might see higher 
prices because of Pataki's plan. It will be expensive for power 
plants to make the modifications that the governor's plan calls 
for, he said.

<HEADLINE> Unisys Profit Grows 72 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLUE BELL, Pa. (AP) -- Unisys Corp. reported a 72 percent  
increase in third-quarter profit as growth in international 
business and cost controls offset slower computer sales to the U.S. 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	Unisys earned $138.4 million, or 43 cents per share, up from  
$93.8 million, or 25 cents a share, during the same period a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The results beat expectations of Wall Street analysts, according  
to First Call/Thomson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	The results reflect a $22 million, or 7 cents per share, gain  
from a tax benefit and a $12.1 million, or 4 cents per share, 
charge for debt retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues grew 4 percent to $1.87 billion from $1.79 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Unisys reported better-than-expected sales from its technology  
segment, which includes its computer systems business. It also had 
improved operating profits in its services businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Recovering economies overseas gave Unisys improved growth in  
international markets, particularly in Japan and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the company suffered declines in its sales to the U.S.  
government due to pricing pressure and delays in some contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	The company reported success from cost control steps, including  
the retirement of preferred stock and debt that reduced interest 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of the year, Unisys earned $366.3  
million, or $1.13 per share, up from $240.7 million, or 60 cents 
per share, in the same period of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose to $5.58 billion from $5.19 billion.

<HEADLINE> CBS Show Breaks Obscenity Barrier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An obscenity barrier has been broken on network  
television, with the use of an epithet for excrement on CBS's 
``Chicago Hope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Actor Mark Harmon, playing Dr. Jack McNeil on the medical drama,  
was appeared before a medical review board on Thursday night's show 
to explain why a promising teen-aged baseball pitcher had to have 
his arm amputated when an infection set in following a series of 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``---- happens,'' Harmon said.  
</P>
<P>
	Neither a CBS spokesman nor Henry Bromell, executive producer of  
the series, could remember a time when censors had allowed the word 
to be used. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nothing I haven't tried a couple of times before, except  
this time, I won,'' Bromell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since producers felt strongly that the word was important for  
artistic truthfulness, CBS chose to support them, spokesman Chris 
Ender said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly this is not something happening on a weekly basis,''  
he said. ``This is an isolated incident. It's not a sign or a 
signal that CBS is loosening its standards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CBS took special steps to respond to any of its more than 200  
affiliates who may have been concerned about offending viewers, he 
said. The network planned to feed the video to affiliates Thursday 
afternoon, instead of live Thursday night, to give the local 
stations the option of masking the word. 
</P>
<P>
	A handful of stations expressed concern upon hearing about the  
expletive, Ender said.

<HEADLINE> Mortgage Rates Move Higher / National Mortgage Survey  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The average interest rate on 30-year  
fixed-rate mortgages inched up to 7.85 percent this week, the 
highest level in more than a month. 
</P>
<P>
	The average was up from 7.82 percent last week, according to a  
weekly survey released Thursday by Freddie Mac, the mortgage 
company. The average for the week ending Oct. 15 was the highest 
since the week ending Sept. 10, when the 30-year rate was at 7.88 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Mortgages rates have been on an upward climb this year. The  
average rates on a 30-year mortgage have hit a low of 6.74 percent 
set at the end of January and a high of 8.15 percent set in mid 
August. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen-year mortgages, a popular option for refinancing,  
averaged 7.45 percent this week, also up from the average of 7.43 
percent last week. 
</P>
<P>
	On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an  
average initial rate of 6.31 percent this week, up from 6.27 
percent the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	The rates do not include add-on fees known as points, which  
averaged at or just over 1 percent of the loan amount for all three 
types of mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the Mortgage Bankers Association of America said  
that mortgage loan applications for the week ending Oct. 8, 
decreased 7.1 percent from the previous week and were down 70 
percent compared to the same week last year.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals' Plummer Wants To Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Jake Plummer is hurting again. A hip pointer  
has kept him out of practice this week, but he said Thursday with 
the help of pain-killing drugs he expects to play against the 
Washington Redskins on Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not big on using pain-killers, but with the importance of  
this game, us going into the bye week with an even record is very 
important for us, and that's something I want to do,'' Plummer 
said. ``I want to be able to play Sunday, because I think it helps 
the team's chances. Right now I think with the pain-killer I will 
be able to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came back in the game last weekend after taking the  
pain-killer, and the pain went away in my hip, so I know that the 
pain-killer does work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer was hurt when he was tackled while scrambling early in  
the third quarter of last Sunday's 14-3 victory over the New York 
Giants. Sandwiched between two defenders, he hurt his hip and his 
ribs. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury came just as he finally was recovering from a  
sprained right thumb that severely limited his practice time since 
the preseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've played a lot of football and until now I've been  
injury-free,'' Plummer said. ``These things are going to happen in 
the sport we're in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer said the injury affects him whenever he tries to throw  
with any authority. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hips, that's where you make your money throwing the  
ball,'' Plummer said. ``You get the torque and you get the twisting 
and the motion there. It's all generated from that left hip, the 
one that leads, and that's the one that's hurting me now. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can stand and throw it 15 or 20 yards, but that's when I'm  
standing flat-footed. If I step into it, that's where I feel a 
little pain. We'll just have to keep getting treatment on it, and 
by Sunday hopefully it goes away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants game was Plummer's best of the season. After throwing  
13 interceptions and two touchdowns in his first four games, he 
completed 13 of 19 for 156 yards and a touchdown in a little more 
than one half of play. He did not throw an interception. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Vince Tobin said Plummer seems to be feeling better each  
day this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``He missed two very valuable days of practice, which you don't  
like to see, but sometimes that happens, because the objective is 
to get him healthy enough to play on Sunday,'' Tobin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer might have his favorite target, wide receiver Rob Moore,  
who missed the last two games with a strained hamstring. Moore 
participated in part of Thursday's practice. 
</P>
<P>
	However, cornerback Tommy Knight sprained his left ankle. Knight  
was the projected starter because Corey Chavous has a sprained 
knee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it will be OK,'' said Knight, who has been bothered by  
injuries throughout his NFL career. 
</P>
<P>
	Defensive ends Simeon Rice and Andre Wadsworth also sat out the  
practice, Rice with a bruised thigh and Wadsworth with a sore toe, 
but both are expected to play Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Cardinals said defensive tackle Mark Smith has  
told them that noted knee specialist Dr. Richard Steadman will 
perform arthroscopic surgery on Smith's right knee. The surgery 
won't be done until Oct. 25, because Steadman isn't available until 
then. 
</P>
<P>
	Steadman performed the second surgery on Eric Swann's arthritic  
right knee last year after Swann was dissatisfied with the results 
of his first surgery, done by team doctor Russell Chick.

<HEADLINE> Umpires Urged To Imitate NFL Calls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A day after a blown call cost the Red Sox an  
extra-inning scoring opportunity, Boston manager Jimy Williams said 
he would like to see umpires imitate other sports and discuss tough 
decisions to make sure they get them right. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpire Rick Reed has admitted that he blew a call at second base  
in the 10th inning of Game 1 of the AL championship series. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's six umpires out there. They're supposed to be a  
team,'' Williams said Thursday. ``They have to help each other, 
don't they?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reed got a cheer from the Yankee Stadium crowd when he was  
introduced prior to Game 2 of the best-of-7 series. 
</P>
<P>
	The good will did not last long, however. Reed, working at first  
base, called Chuck Knoblauch out on a close play leading off the 
New York first, drawing boos from the fans and a brief argument 
from manager Joe Torre. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday night, after Jose Offerman singled leading off the  
10th, John Valentin hit a grounder to third. Scott Brosius threw to 
second attempting to force the runner, but Knoblauch dropped the 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed called Offerman out, even though the replay showed  
Knoblauch never had the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought he had possession before he dropped the ball,'' Reed  
said after the game. ``After we went in and looked at the tape, we 
decided that wasn't the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``As an umpire, it was my job to get it right. I didn't. You  
feel bad about it. I feel awful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of having runners at first and second with nobody out,  
the Red Sox had a runner on first with one out. The next batter, 
Brian Daubach, hit into an inning-ending double play. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernie Williams led off the bottom of the 10th with a  
game-winning home run off Rod Beck. 
</P>
<P>
	``It changed the whole format of the game,'' Boston outfielder  
Darren Lewis said. ``On that type of play, you need that call.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams wondered why baseball umpires can't follow the lead of  
the NFL and NBA, leagues whose officials frequently discuss a play 
before making a call. The Red Sox manager said, however, he doesn't 
want baseball to use instant replay, as professional football does. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love the human element in baseball. I think it's a beautiful  
part of this game,'' Williams said. ``I think maybe the game's a 
lot like life. So why put something like that in there?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams noted that the umpires corrected themselves in the  
first round when Cleveland's Travis Fryman hit the ball off an 
outfield railing against the Red Sox. The ball bounced back onto 
the field and was ruled in play by left-field umpire Tim Welke, but 
Jim Joyce, who was at second base, came out to say it was a homer. 
</P>
<P>
	``He (Joyce) said our whole responsibility is to get the call  
right,'' Williams said, ``so I accepted that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Williams is wondering why this crew didn't have the same  
attitude. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't ask Rick (to ask) for help. I guess I messed up,''  
Williams said. ``But why did I have to?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, who was more annoyed than angry about the incident,  
said he did not blame the umpires for Boston's Game 1 loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm certainly not trying to tell the American League how to  
run their umpires. I'm not mad up here. And I'm not saying we would 
have scored,'' he said. ``I'm not trying to point the finger at 
Rick Reed or anything. We have to go on.''

<HEADLINE> Authorities Searching for Murderer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ROSA, N.M. (AP) -- A nationwide manhunt was under way  
Thursday for a convicted child-killer who escaped from a 
inmate-transport bus hours before guards even noticed that he was 
missing. 
</P>
<P>
	The president of TransCor America Inc., the privately-run  
transport company, acknowledged a preliminary investigation 
indicated ``several procedural violations have occurred involving 
security policies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are embarrassed by this incident, and are reviewing all  
standing policies and procedures,'' John Zierdt Jr. said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Convicted murderer Kyle Bell, 32, fled at 4 a.m. Wednesday from  
a bus that stopped for fuel at a Santa Rosa station adjacent to 
busy Interstate 40. 
</P>
<P>
	Guards aboard the bus did not realize Bell was missing until  
nine hours later, when they arrived in St. Johns, Ariz., said state 
police Lt. Rich Newman. 
</P>
<P>
	New Mexico state police were not notified until 11 hours after  
the escape. 
</P>
<P>
	The bus' owner, Nashville-based TransCor, is the largest of its  
kind in the country, transporting 77,000 inmates a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell was being taken to Oregon City, Ore., from North Dakota,  
where he was convicted of murder in the 1993 disappearance of an 
11-year-old girl whose body was never found. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell apparently had a handcuff key hidden in his shoe that went  
undetected after a strip search by the company hired to transport 
him in a modified Greyhound bus, Newman said.

<HEADLINE> Jury Deliberating Fate of Ex-Nurse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRAZIL, Ind. (AP) -- A jury today began deliberating the fate of  
a former nurse accused of killing seven patients with lethal 
injections. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors received the case after Judge Ernest Yelton read them 23  
pages of detailed instructions. The defendant, Orville Lynn Majors, 
38, watched without expression. 
</P>
<P>
	Majors, who has been jailed since January 1998, is charged with  
seven counts of murder and could face life in prison if he is 
convicted. He is accused of giving the injections at the Vermillion 
County Hospital from 1993 to 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	As the six-week trial neared its end Wednesday, the courtroom  
was packed with Majors' family members and the relatives of 
patients who died at the tiny hospital in nearby Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't let him get away with this,'' prosecuting attorney Greg  
Carter said in his closing argument, his voice breaking. ``He 
killed these people. Don't let him get away with this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A deputy prosecutor, Nina Alexander, cited the death of Margaret  
Hornick, one of the seven patients. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nine minutes. That's how long she survived in Mr. Majors care.  
Nine minutes,'' she said. The 79-year-old woman died in November 
1994 after entering the hospital with a broken hip. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys told jurors that common sense would indicate  
all the patients died of natural causes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time for Lynn Majors to go home,'' said defense attorney  
I. Marshall Pinkus. 
</P>
<P>
	He said an acquittal would end a torturous journey that began  
when Majors was fired from his job at the hospital on March 9, 
1995, based on nothing more than misplaced suspicions. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are the facts you're going to have to look at very  
closely, not the smokescreen presented by the state,'' Pinkus said. 
</P>
<P>
	During the six-week trial, prosecutors presented medical experts  
who testified the seven deaths were consistent with lethal 
injections of potassium chloride, epinephrine or both. Police had 
found vials for those drugs in Majors' van and his garage. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, relatives of the patients testified they saw Majors near  
the patients before they died, and in four of the cases giving them 
injections. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the family physicians of the patients and other defense  
witnesses testified the deaths were caused by the illnesses had 
sent the seven to the hospital to begin with.

<HEADLINE> Most Asian Markets Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Despite a second straight day of sharp losses  
on Wall Street, most Asian stock markets managed to edge higher 
Thursday, taking their cue from the region's largest bourse, Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese shares rose, albeit slightly, as investors welcomed  
news of a merger between two large Japanese banks, Sumitomo Bank 
and Sakura Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average climbed 25.77 points, or 0.15  
percent, to 17,780.26. The average had fallen 1.86 percent 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Sumitomo-Sakura news has rekindled hopes for industry  
realignments,'' said Hiroichi Nishi, deputy general manager at 
Nikko Securities Co. ``But weak New York markets are worrisome, and 
investor buying interests aren't spreading.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wall Street overnight, the Dow Jones industrial average  
tumbled 1.77 percent, bringing its losses for the week to 3.9 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the U.S. dollar rose against the Japanese  
yen. In late trading, the dollar cost 107.27 yen, up 0.69 yen from 
106.58 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo and also above its overnight New 
York level of 106.60 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong shares, having suffered hefty falls in recent days,  
also rose slightly, lifted by Tokyo's gains. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 10.95 points, or 0.1 percent,  
to 12,486.82. The Hang Seng had lost 4.9 percent over the past 
three days, including a 2.2-percent drop Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But in Jakarta, share prices continued to fall as antigovernment  
student protests escalated in the Indonesian capital. 
</P>
<P>
	The JSX Composite index fell 0.73 percent, or 4.170 points, to  
567.777. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:

day. The SET index rose 1.29 points, or 0.33 percent, to 392.79. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian shares remained largely unchanged amid  
cautious sentiment. The composite index rose 0.77 point, or 0.1 
percent, to 738.05. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares fell as investors cashed in gambling  
stocks that had soared in recent sessions. The PSE index fell 4.12 
points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,046.60. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: South Korean shares rose, led by brokerage firms and  
high-technology telecommunications companies. The Korea Composite 
Stock Price Index rallied 1.2 percent, or 10.50 points, to 866.02. 
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Share prices rose slightly, but investors remained  
cautious amid recent market weakness. The Straits Times Index rose 
16.94 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,112.54. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian shares fell slightly, triggered by Wall  
Street's losses and a slide in Australian bond prices to two-year 
lows. The All Ordinaries Index closed at 2,901.3, down 5.4 points, 
or 0.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Taiwanese shares rose despite Wall Street losses and  
news that some leading Taiwan memory chipmakers may be hit by new 
U.S. antidumping duties of as high as 69 percent. The Weighted 
Price Index rose 42.97 points, or 0.55 percent, to 7,879.91. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand stocks rose on foreign buying. The

<HEADLINE> Helicopter Crashes at LAX </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A helicopter crash-landed Thursday at Los  
Angeles International Airport, injuring three people. 
</P>
<P>
	The injured, described as men ages 25-30, were conscious when  
they were taken to UCLA Medical Center in serious but stable 
condition, said Fire Department spokesman Jim Wells. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does not appear that their injuries are life-threatening at  
this time,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bell Jet Ranger 206-B crashed at 4:31 p.m. on a taxiway  
between terminals 4 and 5 near the airport's heliport. 
</P>
<P>
	It remained upright and largely intact but with damage to the  
landing skids and tail. 
</P>
<P>
	The helicopter was on approach to the airport when it went down,  
said Angela Franklin, spokeswoman for the city's Department of 
Airports. She could not say where it was coming from or the purpose 
of the flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the crash took place in an area between terminals,  
officials had to close Delta Airlines' gates 50-55 and route 
flights to other gates, Franklin said.

<HEADLINE> Retail Sales Rise in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Retail sales rose just 0.1 percent in  
September as Americans pulled in their spending somewhat on cars 
and clothing from last month's buying frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
	Total retail sales rose last month to a seasonally adjusted  
$253.4 billion, the Commerce Department said today. That was 
slightly worse than the 0.2 percent increase many analysts were 
forecasting. 
</P>
<P>
	The September increase followed a revised 1.5 percent gain in  
August, better than the 1.2 percent the government previously 
estimated. 
</P>
<P>
	Retail sales have climbed or held steady most months of this  
year and were 10.5 percent higher than September of last year. 
</P>
<P>
	September's performance may be a sign that the Federal Reserve's  
two interest rate increases in June and August are beginning to 
slow consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of the total 
economy. The Fed has boosted short-term interest rates by one-half 
percentage point this summer and long-term rates, including 
mortgage rates, have risen even more this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the central bank said it wouldn't raise rates for  
now, but left open the possibility of a third rate increase later 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Has the consumer disappeared from the malls? No way. The big  
difference ... was essentially in the motor vehicle sector,'' said 
economist Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors. 
</P>
<P>
	The consumer sector is being supported by the lowest  
unemployment rate in nearly three decades, a 4.2 percent level that 
has given more workers cash to spend. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report today, the Labor Department said that the  
number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits last week fell 
by an unexpected 29,000 to 285,000 as the jobs market bounced back 
after the effects of Hurricane Floyd. Economists believe that 
jobless claims levels under 300,000 are an indication of an 
extremely tight labor market. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall retail sales were held back by a 1.3 decline in sales of  
news cars and trucks at automobile dealerships in September. That 
followed a strong 3.1 percent increase the month before. Still, the 
auto industry is anticipating a record sales year in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding the volatile autos category, retail sales rose a brisk  
0.6 percent in September. Many analysts were expecting a 0.5 
percent gain. 
</P>
<P>
	Given this, some economists said today's report doesn't rule out  
a third rate increase by the Fed when it meets in November. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales at apparel and accessory stores were down in September,  
dropping 0.9 percent following a 1.2 percent gain the month before. 
</P>
<P>
	And, sales at hardware and building supply stores were down 0.6  
percent in September despite Hurricane Floyd, which raked the East 
Coast last month. That category, which also includes mobile home 
dealers, posted a 0.4 percent gain in August. 
</P>
<P>
	But there were bright spots in the report. Sales at furniture  
and home furnishing stores posted a solid 1.2 percent gain in 
September after 0.7 percent gain in August. 
</P>
<P>
	General merchandise stores, which includes department stores,  
rose 1.0 percent in September after a 0.5 percent gain in August, 
while sales at drug stores were up 1.0 percent and sales at bars 
and restaurants increased 0.6 percent. Sales at grocery stores also 
rose 0.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest gain in September came from sales at gasoline  
stations, which were up 2.4 percent reflecting rising energy 
prices. That followed a 2.7 percent rise in August. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's biggest retailers last week reported that sales  
rose modestly in September as the robust U.S. economy continued to 
encourage shoppers to spend despite volatility in the stock market, 
rising interest rates and the hurricane.

<HEADLINE> Singer Johnny Rodriguez Acquitted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UVALDE, Texas (AP) -- A jury has acquitted country singer Johnny  
Rodriguez of murder in the death of an acquaintance he claimed he 
thought was a burglar. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors found Rodriguez innocent in the shooting of Israel  
``Bosco'' Borrego, 26, who was hit once in the abdomen in 1998 at 
the Rodriguez family home in Sabinal. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez's lawyers had argued that he was justified under Texas  
law to defend himself and his property. But prosecutors contended 
that Rodriguez was drunk and used a pistol to kill Borrego -- 
described as a regular drinking buddy -- as Borrego cooked in 
Rodriguez's kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
	The 47-year-old singer, who could have faced life in prison, put  
his face in his hands when the verdict was announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just sorry that the whole incident took place,'' Rodriguez  
said. ``I don't want to go through anything like this again. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez is best known for his 1970s hits such as ``Pass Me By  
(If You're Only Passing Through)'' and ``Ridin' My Thumb to 
Mexico'' that soared into the Top 10 on the country charts. His 
career took a downturn by the 1990s, but he still plays concerts in 
South Texas.

	PEC, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The United Nations will not endorse the  
concept of an independent Kosovo, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan 
said today as he visited neighborhoods destroyed by Serb forces. 
``We are not here to prepare the people for independence,'' he 
said. ``A multiethnic Kosovo is our mandate.'' Kosovo is 
administered by the United Nations, backed by a NATO-led 
peacekeeping force. But it formally remains a province of Serbia -- 
the main republic in Yugoslavia. Annan toured a residential suburb 
of the western Kosovo city of Pec that was destroyed during the 
18-month Serb crackdown on the province.

heterosexual couples who live together but are not married. Forty 
percent of French children are now born to unmarried couples. 
Similar legislation already exists in several European countries.

	10 Percent of U.S. Households Hungry  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nearly 10 percent of U.S. households are going  
hungry or don't have consistent access to adequate food, the 
Agriculture Department said today. In New Mexico, 15.1 percent of 
households were either hungry or threatened with hunger from 1996 
to 1998, according to a USDA study. Mississippi, Texas, Arizona, 
Louisiana, Arkansas and Oregon had rates of 12.6 percent or higher. 
Overall, hunger hit at least 10 percent of the households in 18 
states, USDA said. ``During this, the most prosperous economy in 
decades, it should shock most Americans to learn that hunger 
persists and it is in every state,'' Agriculture Secretary Dan 
Glickman said.

against the tide of history,'' Gore says in the ad airing late 
today or tomorrow in Iowa, New Hampshire and nationally on CNN, 
according to a script released by the campaign. The Senate's 51-48 
vote yesterday fell far short of the required 67 votes needed to 
ratify the treaty. Only four Republican voted for it.

	Big San Francicso Quake Feared  
</P>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- There is a 70 percent chance that a large  
earthquake will shake the San Francisco Bay area in the next 30 
years, according to a new federal study released today. The new 
conclusion: There are a number of faults slicing through heavily 
developed areas around San Francisco, more chances they will 
rupture and more people who will be affected when they do. The 
estimate from the U.S. Geological Survey is slightly greater than 
that found by a 1990 study because it spreads the earthquake hazard 
over a much broader region.

closer ties with Russia and creating conditions for lasting peace 
in the Balkans. Robertson said he would seek to build up the 
defense capabilities of NATO's European members to create a better 
balance between Europe and the United States within the alliance. 
``More Europe in NATO does not mean less North America,'' he said, 
adding ``a strong transatlantic connection'' is vital for the

Cuba this morning, prompting authorities to evacuate tens of 
thousands of people and the storm, expected to creep north toward 
Florida, was already battering Miami with rain and forcing tourists 
to leave the Keys. Although still a weak hurricane, Irene worries 
forecasters because it is all but stationary. ``The longer it stays 
down there, the longer it has time to crank up,'' said National 
Hurricane Center meteorologist Michael Formosa. Irene is expected 
to hit the Tampa area by Sunday. Heavy rains were blamed for 
causing some traffic accidents in Miami today.

standoff never seen by the public, The Dallas Morning News reported 
today. Government documents obtained by the newspaper show that at 
least five FBI agents were sent to the compound near Waco to 
maintain closed-circuit cameras on April 19, the day federal agents 
launched an assault against the compound. The records contain 
written statements from FBI agents and technicians that recordings 
were made, even though no such videotape has ever been released.

	Lawmakers Question IOC on Reform  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers on a House panel investigating  
Atlanta's bid for the 1996 Summer Games today questioned the 
International Olympic Committee's commitment to reforming the bid 
process for selecting cities to play host to the games. Rep. Ron 
Klink, D-Pa., the senior Democrat on the House Commerce 
subcommittee on investigations and oversight, said he's ``skeptical 
that the IOC is serious this time'' about changing the culture that 
produced the Salt Lake City scandal and Atlanta's violation of IOC 
rules in lavishing gifts on committee members. Rep. Joe. Barton, 
R-Texas, called for the removal of IOC President Juan Antonio 
Samaranch ``sooner rather than later.''

<HEADLINE> Furniture Sellers Believe in Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HIGH POINT, N.C. (AP) -- When Jay Busey's son suggested he take  
his Shaw Furniture Galleries online, his initial reaction was, ``No 
way, you have to touch it and feel it to buy furniture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, he thinks differently.  
</P>
<P>
	``Customers do want to buy on the Internet. They're buying every  
day,'' said Busey, president and chief executive officer of Shaw 
Furniture Galleries, a living.com company. 
</P>
<P>
	The chief reason consumers log onto his site is convenience.  
</P>
<P>
	``When a customer wants information, they want it quickly,'' he  
said. ``This is why they turn to the Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While e-commerce represents a minuscule segment of furniture  
sales at the dawn of the new century, it is expected to grow 
steadily, a panel of furniture sellers and industry experts agreed 
Thursday as the International Home Furnishings Market opened its 
nine-day fall run. 
</P>
<P>
	``The real key is helping local retailers understand that this  
is just a small piece of the total pie,'' said Steve Antisdel, 
president of FurnitureFind.com, which expects to finish the year 
with $12 million in sales. 
</P>
<P>
	That's just a tiny fraction of the amount of sales posted by  
traditional furniture stores. The U.S. retail market is $55 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``My belief is that it (e-commerce) will grow the industry  
rather than take away from the traditional retailers,'' said 
Antisdel. ``It will help consumers educate themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Industry analyst Jerry Epperson isn't a believer just yet, but  
admitted he was intrigued by the number of people at the market who 
want to talk to him about e-commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet is the gold rush of our age,'' he said Thursday.  
``The last time we had a gold rush, the ones who made money were 
those people who were selling picks and shovels. Not too many 
people found gold.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other words, he said, online retailers that deliver solid  
customer service along with slick Web pages and computer graphics 
will be the ones who survive. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry officials estimate e-commerce now represents about $100  
million of the total retail furniture market, but by 2003, the 
amount of goods sold over the Internet will grow to $1.5 billion -- 
still just 3 percent of the market. 
</P>
<P>
	But some are strongly resisting the push by some to take the  
industry online. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivan Cutler, furniture analyst with BDO Seidman L.L.P. in High  
Point, touched upon the dissension within the industry over the 
value of e-commerce when he introduced three panelists, whom he 
described as pioneers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of these people are hated and reviled by the full-service  
furniture stores. In fact, they are called `dot-commies,''' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's largest furniture trade show, which runs through  
Oct. 22, draws about 70,000 people from all 50 states and more than 
100 foreign countries. Buyers can choose from more than 2,400 
exhibitors that fill more than 8 million square feet of showroom 
space in High Point and nearby Thomasville. 
</P>
<P>
	The mood at the start of the show was upbeat.  
</P>
<P>
	Despite a recent rise in interest rates, Epperson said consumers  
are continuing to buy new homes along with the things they need to 
furnish them. That signals good things for people in the industry, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry officials expect overall 1999 furniture shipments to  
eclipse last year's record figures. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the American Furniture Manufacturers Association's  
latest quarterly forecast, 1999, furniture shipments should 
approach $25 billion -- an 8 percent increase over 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Retail sales will exceed $61 billion this year, the forecast  
says, a 5.5 percent increase over 1998. Retail sales are expected 
to be nearly $63.9 billion in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The AFMA forecasts shipments of wood furniture to increase 8.7  
percent to nearly $12 billion; shipments of upholstered furniture 
are expected to rise 10.3 percent to $10.5 billion.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Georgetown Coach to TBS, TNT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Former Georgetown coach John Thompson, who resigned abruptly  
during the early part of last season, has joined Turner Sports as 
an NBA analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, who has not ruled out returning to coaching in the  
future, will work a full slate of games this season for both TNT 
and TBS. He replaces Doc Rivers, who left the cable network to 
coach the Orlando Magic. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson might be teamed with Kevin Harlan.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm totally committed to doing it,'' Thompson said Thursday.  
``I have been looking to do something that kept me close to 
basketball, but this isn't something that I planned. They called me 
to audition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson stunned college basketball in January when he resigned,  
citing personal reasons related to his marriage. His name has come 
up for various NBA coaching jobs since. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a personal thing as to why I got out of coaching,''  
Thompson said. ``I was going through a divorce that is pretty much 
resolved now. As I said then, I was resigning -- not retiring. ... I 
didn't stop coaching because I didn't like it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, enshrined in the Basketball Hall of Fame on Oct. 1,  
coached 27 seasons at Georgetown, compiling a 596-239 record. He 
led the Hoyas to 24 straight postseason appearances and three NCAA 
Final Fours, including a national championship in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the Boston Celtics' backup center for Bill Russell on the  
1965 and 1966 NBA championship teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are several players who I coached and have relationships  
with that are key players in the NBA,'' Thompson said. ``I'm around 
the game a lot and I'm going to have fun with this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among those he coached who are currently in the league are Allen  
Iverson, Alonzo Mourning and Patrick Ewing. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson has served as an analyst for Turner Sports' annual NBA  
draft coverage since 1997. He also is the host of a sports talk 
radio program in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``John brings with him nearly four decades of basketball  
experience and an understanding of the game and its players that is 
unparalleled,'' said Turner executive producer Mike Pearl.

<HEADLINE>  Border Zone Buffer Sought in Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, East Timor (AP) -- The commander of East Timor's  
peacekeeping forces today proposed establishment of a buffer zone 
along the border with West Timor to prevent further clashes between 
his men and Indonesian forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Relations between the multinational soldiers and Indonesian  
forces were severely strained by a gun battle Sunday along the 
border separating East Timor, which recently voted for independence 
from Indonesia, and Indonesian-controlled West Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	The Australian-led peacekeepers also clashed recently with  
several members of anti-independence militias closely allied with 
Indonesian forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Australian Maj. Gen. Peter Cosgrove, the peace force commander,  
said he would propose creating a zone along the poorly marked 
border to keep the forces apart. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to make sure that the people in the border area are  
themselves safe. So the best way to do that is to have military 
forces, which are fully armed and on alert, actually not 
confronting themselves,'' Cosgrove said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is standard military practice in areas of tension, and I  
would think that is something well worth consideration,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Sunday's firefight erupted when Indonesian forces shot at  
an Australian patrol they accused of crossing the border into West 
Timor. The Australians fired back. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia claims one policeman was shot to death and two others  
were wounded in the clash. 
</P>
<P>
	Cosgrove denied his troops, known as Interfet, had strayed into  
Indonesian-controlled territory. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Australian soldiers in Liquica district, 30 miles  
west of the capital, Dili, cited local witnesses as saying about 
100 militiamen had been seen in the surrounding district despite an 
increase in the peacekeeper garrison there. 
</P>
<P>
	Cosgrove, however, disputed claims by a militia leader that some  
150 anti-independence fighters had infiltrated across the border 
and set up camp in Liquica. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a strong Interfet element in Liquica,'' Cosgrove  
said. ``This claim is plainly rubbish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Australian-led force took control of East Timor on Sept. 20,  
after the province was ravaged by Indonesian troops and their 
militia proxies angered by residents' overwhelming vote for 
independence from Indonesia in an Aug. 30 referendum. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Indonesian forces have withdrawn from East Timor, but about  
1,400 remain in Dili. 
</P>
<P>
	The militia leader Eurico Gutterres told The Associated Press on  
Wednesday that dozens of anti-independence militants who had fled 
East Timor after the peacekeepers arrived are secretly returning 
from West Timor with plans to launch a guerrilla campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	In Canberra, Australia, East Timorese independence leader Jose  
Alexandre ``Xanana'' Gusmao thanked Australia today for its efforts 
to restore peace to his territory and said he would return to Dili 
sometime next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Gusmao, who has not been in East Timor since being arrested by  
Indonesia in 1992, is on an international tour that has included 
meetings with senior White House officials and U.N. 
Secretary-General Kofi Annan. 
</P>
<P>
	In Jakarta, protesters today threw as many as two dozen gasoline  
bombs and rocks at the Australian Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was injured, but several bombs cleared the barrier and  
exploded on the embassy grounds, burning grass and plants. 
Witnesses said about 200 police in riot gear stood by and watched 
but took no action against the group of about 300 people.

<HEADLINE> Chris-Craft Mulls Sale of Stations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Chris-Craft Industries Inc. is exploring the  
sale of some or all of its 10 television stations, and is talking 
to major media companies including CBS Corp., News Corp. and 
General Electric Corp.'s NBC unit, according to a person familiar 
with the situation. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris-Craft, the New York-based company which made motor boats  
until 1981, now makes almost all of its money from its TV station 
group, which includes WWOR in New York and KCOP in Los Angeles. The 
company also has small interests in health-care products and 
plastics. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's shares have risen about 40 percent since August,  
when federal regulators cleared the way for broadcasting companies 
to own more than one TV station in the same city, under certain 
conditions. The decision triggered a wave of discussions among 
owners of television stations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems that CBS would be a very likely buyer,'' said Laura  
Linehan, a vice president at Gabelli Asset Management, which is one 
of Chris-Craft's largest shareholders. ``But any network operator, 
obviously, would like to double up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Viacom Inc., the entertainment company that is buying CBS Corp.,  
has a joint-venture partnership with Chris-Craft in the United 
Paramount Network, or UPN. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen for Chris-Craft, CBS, News Corp., NBC, and Walt Disney  
Co.'s ABC all declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Davis, an analyst at Schroder &AMP; Co., said Chris-Craft's  
chairman Herb Siegel ``is speaking to anyone and everyone since 
(ownership) rules have changed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The source familiar with the situation, who requested anonymity,  
said Chris-Craft's discussions are in the early stages and would 
likely take weeks to play out. 
</P>
<P>
	If Chris-Craft sells out, it would be the third TV-related deal  
since the rule change in August. Viacom's acquisition of CBS, 
announced last month, started as a discussion to swap TV assets. 
Also last month, NBC paid $415 million for a 32 percent stake in 
Paxson Communications Corp., a major station owner. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry experts expect the trend to continue over the next  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly there are going to be deals, there are going to be  
station swaps, and undoubtedly further alliances,'' Davis said. 
``Which players pair up with which is awfully hard to predict.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to UPN, Chris-Craft owns 80 percent of BHC  
Communications Inc. The company also has a small health-care 
products business, which makes items like hospital laundry bags, 
and a plastic flexible films business, which is in fiberglass. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's sales totaled $472 million last year, and it is  
sitting on $1.7 billion in cash.

<HEADLINE> CIA Goes to Hollywood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANGLEY, Va. (AP) -- Let you in on a little secret: The CIA has  
gone Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	By opening its doors to a movie crew to shoot a few scenes of  
``In the Company of Spies'' at its cloistered headquarters in this 
Washington suburb, the CIA reaped a rare reward -- a 
klieg-light-bright portrayal of a spy agency more accustomed to 
dark jokes about blown covers and bungled missions. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie, produced by Showtime and Paramount Network  
Television, depicts a heroic team of CIA officers and analysts who 
pull off a monumental covert operation that not only snatches one 
brave officer from the jaws of death but also saves the United 
States from nuclear disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	Oh, yes, and the acts of derring-do also avert a nasty dustup  
with the Russians. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie is scheduled to air on Showtime on Oct. 24.  
</P>
<P>
	To mark the most extensive CIA cooperation with movie makers  
ever, the agency's director, George Tenet, invited the film's stars 
-- Tom Berenger, Ron Silver and Alice Krige -- as well as CIA 
employees and a cast of Washington political luminaries to a 
screening and private reception Wednesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	``They portrayed us in a very good light,'' Tenet told  
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	His appraisal was affirmed in a spontaneous burst of applause  
from the audience at a point near the end of the movie when the 
president (played by Len Cariou) learns that the CIA effort 
succeeded in foiling a North Korean plot to import Russian missiles 
capable of striking the U.S. West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it's good, it's spectacular,'' he says of the agency.  
</P>
<P>
	The president's national security adviser, whose constant  
second-guessing of the CIA's daring plan is meant to represent the 
kind of political wishy-washiness that many believe has weakened 
the agency in recent years, responds by saying the agency's 
reputation was built on its mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lesson in that,'' the president replies. With that,  
the audience broke into applause. 
</P>
<P>
	That is precisely the message Tenet and the rest of the CIA want  
the American public to hear -- that despite its setbacks, the 
usually untold successes are what makes the agency so valuable. 
</P>
<P>
	``What Showtime has done is given us a chance to tell our  
story,'' Tenet told the audience before the screening started. He 
even made a recruiting pitch, saying he was ``not ashamed to say'' 
that young Americans who see the film should consider the 
intelligence field as a rewarding career. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Cort, one of the film's producers, said he was an analyst  
at CIA headquarters for two years in the early 1970s. He said his 
cover was that he worked for ``some obscure Army agency,'' and in 
that period he realized how little Americans know about what the 
CIA does. ``They have no idea who you people are,'' he said, 
addressing his comments to the CIA employees in the audience. 
</P>
<P>
	Tenet said he believes the movie will give Americans a more  
accurate picture of the CIA, which often is portrayed in Hollywood 
as an inept, even evil, enterprise operating beyond the White 
House's control. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are open,'' Tenet said. ``This is a new world.''  
</P>
<P>
	For the Showtime producers, the CIA provided technical advice to  
make the film more accurate and realistic, spokesman William Harlow 
said. That is the kind of cooperation the Pentagon often provides 
to Hollywood (there is even a full-time Pentagon staff to 
coordinate it), but it's new for the CIA. 
</P>
<P>
	Even in an era of more openness by the CIA, the idea of  
Hollywood stars descending on the agency's wooded compound along 
the Potomac River was remarkable -- especially for those who work 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a change of pace, an enjoyable, fun thing'' for CIA  
employees who spend most of their careers behind cloaks of 
anonymity, said Harlow, the agency's chief of public affairs. Only 
``overt'' employees like him, whose names are publicly acknowledged 
by the agency, were attending, Harlow added. 
</P>
<P>
	There was nothing cloak-and-dagger about Wednesday evening's  
screening. In the fading light of a warm autumn day, a parade of 
black limousines deposited stars on the steps of the white 
headquarters building. Television camera lights glared and news 
photographers clicked away as several cast members stopped to chat 
with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Berenger, who plays a retired CIA operative who returns to save  
the day in a crisis with North Korea, said the CIA deserves more 
credit than it generally gets. ``If they do something well and 
right you never hear about it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Dodge Returns to Winston Cup Racing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Dodge will return to Winston Cup racing in 2001  
after an absence of 16 seasons, with top NASCAR crew chief Ray 
Evernham set as its flagship car owner. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler, the parent company of Dodge, announced today  
that Evernham's team would receive full factory support. 
</P>
<P>
	Evernham, who resigned last month after guiding Jeff Gordon to  
three championships in seven seasons, says he will have a two-car 
operation in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``My goal is to get to Victory Lane and take the Dodge people  
with me,'' Evernham said, standing near a sign that read 493 -- the 
number of days until the season-opening 2001 Daytona 500. 
</P>
<P>
	Evernham said part of his job will be to help develop other  
Dodge teams as they come along. NASCAR is hoping their will be 
several. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dodge's return will increase competition, and certainly make  
it deeper,'' said Mike Helton, senior vice president for the 
sanctioning body. 
</P>
<P>
	The Intrepid models Evernham will field will be the first  
Chrysler products in NASCAR's top division since Sept. 15, 1985, 
when Maurice Randall finished last in one of two Chryslers entered 
in the Delaware 500 at Dover Downs International Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	The last Dodge in a Winston Cup race finished 30th with Phil  
Good behind the wheel on June 9, 1985 at Pocono International 
Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
	Chrysler had a tradition of victory in NASCAR. Petty  
Enterprises, its most prolific winner ever, had 237 of its 271 
victories in Chrysler brands. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Petty himself had 175 of his record 200 career victories  
and six of his series-best seven championships in Plymouths and 
Dodges. 
</P>
<P>
	But the auto maker withdrew tech and parts support in the late  
'70s. Petty went winless in 1978, and jumped to General Motors the 
next year, leaving the few remaining Chryslers cars in the hands of 
underfunded independents. 
</P>
<P>
	The late Neil Bonnett accounted for the last Dodge victory, in  
the Los Angeles Times 500 on Nov. 20, 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	Chrysler began its comeback in the sport when Dodges were  
campaigned in the NASCAR truck series in 1995. Since factory 
backing began in 1997, Dodges they have won seven races. 
</P>
<P>
	Evernham, who called the shots for the first 47 of Gordon's 49  
career victories, did not make any announcement concerning drivers 
or other personnel for his team.

<HEADLINE> Another Big S.F. Earthquake Feared </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Earthquake experts delivered a warning to  
the San Francisco Bay area Thursday: There's a 70 percent chance a 
big one will hit in the next 30 years, and the region needs to get 
ready. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're at ground zero. We've had large earthquakes. We will  
have large earthquakes in the future,'' David Schwartz, a U.S. 
Geological Survey scientist, said at a quake conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The 70 percent estimate is for an earthquake at or above a  
magnitude of 6.7, the strength of the 1994 Northridge quake that 
killed 67 people and caused $20 billion in damage in the Los 
Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
	The forecast, which comes with an uncertainty factor of plus or  
minus 10 percent, is different from earlier predictions because it 
expands the danger zone from the Pacific Ocean to the Sacramento 
Delta, about 40 miles inland. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is really no escape,'' Schwartz said.  
</P>
<P>
	Another report released Thursday, this one by the Association of  
Bay Area Governments, said hundreds of thousands could be left 
homeless if a large quake hit. 
</P>
<P>
	The challenge is persuading more people to shore up their  
foundations, particularly owners of apartments buildings, where 
much of the housing loss is likely to occur, said Jeanne Perkins, 
the association's earthquake program manager. 
</P>
<P>
	The conference's keynote speaker, Interior Secretary Bruce  
Babbitt, told local politicians they have to move quicker on 
building a safer Bay Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years ago, the 7.1-magnitude Loma Prieta quake rocked  
Northern California during the World Series and brought down a 
50-foot section of the upper deck of the bridge, which connects San 
Francisco and Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	That damage was fixed, but seismologists say the eastern span  
could collapse in a large quake. Regional authorities approved 
construction of a new single-tower suspension structure for the 
eastern span in 1998 but progress has been held up by political 
squabbling.

<HEADLINE>  No Charges in JonBenet Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- It is an ending few seem happy with.  
</P>
<P>
	The JonBenet Ramsey grand jury was dismissed after 13 months of  
work Wednesday and prosecutors said there isn't enough evidence to 
charge anyone in the 6-year-old's strangulation nearly three years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl's family responded by asking that the investigation go  
on until the killer is caught. Gov. Bill Owens said he may appoint 
a special prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
	But the puzzling case that drew worldwide attention as much for  
its fingerpointing and charges of bungling as for JonBenet's death 
may be over. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know where to go from here,'' said Mimi Wesson, a law  
professor at the University of Colorado. ``Barring some very 
important and convincing new evidence, it is unlikely anyone will 
be charged with this crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boulder District Attorney Alex Hunter, who has said that John  
and Patsy Ramsey were under suspicion in their daughter's death, 
announced Wednesday that prosecutors ``do not have sufficient 
evidence to warrant the filing of charges against anyone who has 
been investigated with this crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He reminded the grand jurors that state law forbids them from  
discussing their work. Owens, meanwhile, promised to review the 
case and decide whether to appoint a special prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
	``While I am not presently in a position to comment on the work  
of this grand jury, I do know one fact: a little girl was brutally 
murdered in Boulder, Colorado, and the killer or killers remain 
free today,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Adams County District Attorney Bob Grant, one of four metro-area  
prosecutors who advised Hunter, told the NBC ``Today'' show today 
that the governor could appoint the state attorney general's office 
to the case. But, he said, experienced prosecutors have reviewed 
all of the evidence ``and have concluded that at this stage ... 
there is insufficient evidence to have a reasonable liklihood of 
conviction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The death in this university town northwest of Denver led to a  
case of extraordinary interest. It created friction between police 
and prosecutors, led to accusations that the district attorney's 
office was too timid and invited scrutiny of the child beauty 
pageant circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The prominence of the family -- John Ramsey, the millionaire  
president of Access Graphics, and Patsy, a former Miss West 
Virginia -- together with the beauty of the little blond victim 
guaranteed coverage of every twist in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ramseys issued a statement Wednesday night, saying the  
family ``lives in a nightmare'' and asking that the investigation 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
	``We take no satisfaction in this result because a child killer  
remains free and undetected,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was before dawn on the day after Christmas in 1996 when Patsy  
Ramsey said she found a 2 1/2-page ransom note on the back staircase 
in the family's home that demanded $118,000 for the safe return of 
JonBenet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Listen Carefully!'' the note begins. ``We are a group of  
individuals that represent a small foreign faction. We respect your 
business but not the country that it serves. At this time we have 
your daughter in our possession.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eight hours later, Ramsey said he found his daughter's body in a  
basement room, wrapped in a white blanket. A rope was wrapped 
around her neck and a wrist and tied to a stick. 
</P>
<P>
	A red-ink heart was drawn on her left palm, and Ramsey told  
police he removed duct tape from the child's mouth before carrying 
her body upstairs. 
</P>
<P>
	An autopsy concluded JonBenet suffered a skull fracture, was  
strangled and beaten, and may have been sexually assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities cleared JonBenet's brother, Burke, who was 9 at the  
time she died. The Ramseys initially told police Burke was sleeping 
when the ransom note was discovered, but his voice later was heard 
on an enhanced tape of Mrs. Ramsey's 911 call to police.	   Critics claimed the investigation was compromised early when 
detectives, believing they were dealing with a kidnapping, allowed 
friends and family to roam through the Ramsey mansion. They also 
asked Ramsey to conduct a search, which led to the discovery of the 
body. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation also was fractured by infighting between  
police and prosecutors over the best way to proceed. Two 
investigators resigned; one accused prosecutors of protecting the 
Ramseys and blocking police efforts to solve the case, while the 
other contended his fellow officers were improperly targeting 
innocent people -- including the Ramseys. 
</P>
<P>
	The two investigators held two theories about JonBenet's killer:  
one focused on the parents; the other on an intruder. The Ramseys, 
who now live in suburban Atlanta, have repeatedly denied any 
involvement in the crime. They offered a $100,000 reward and 
mounted a newspaper campaign seeking JonBenet's killer. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities amassed evidence that supported both theories.  
</P>
<P>
	Lab tests concluded the ransom note was written with a pen and  
pad that belonged to the Ramseys. Handwriting experts ruled Ramsey 
out as the author, but said Mrs. Ramsey's writing samples were 
inconclusive. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado Bureau of Investigation agents concluded four fibers on  
the duct tape allegedly taken from JonBenet's mouth were consistent 
with a jacket her mother wore Christmas night, according to 
published reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Evidence pointing to an intruder includes a broken basement  
window and an apparent pry mark found on a kitchen doorjamb, but 
there were no signs of forced entry into the home or footprints in 
the snow outside. 
</P>
<P>
	Other evidence of an intruder: Investigators have reportedly  
been unable to identify DNA material found in JonBenet's underwear, 
a pubic hair found on the blanket or a palm print pulled from the 
wine cellar door. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boulder County grand jury of eight women and four men began  
hearing evidence in the case in September 1998, listening to 
testimony from family, friends and police detectives. Its term was 
set to expire Oct. 20. 
</P>
<P>
	The cost of the case has nearly topped $2 million for federal,  
state, county and city agencies.

<HEADLINE> Braves Hold Nothing Back in Series </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A few years ago, things got so bad in the Atlanta  
Braves bullpen that John Smoltz volunteered to become the closer. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Bobby Cox finally accepted the offer in Game 2 of the NL  
championship series. 
</P>
<P>
	Showing a no-holds-barred philosophy in this postseason, Cox is  
relying on members of his magnificent starting rotation do double 
duty in the bullpen. On Wednesday, it was Smoltz's turn to make the 
first relief appearance of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	He hardly looked out of place, blowing away the Mets in the  
ninth to preserve a 4-3 victory and give the Braves a 2-0 lead in 
the best-of-7 series as it heads to New York. Game 3 is Friday 
night at Shea Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got an appreciation far greater than I ever had before  
for what those guys do,'' Smoltz said of the regular relievers. 
``It's funny. I've offered many times before to go in situations 
like this, but it never happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Through most of the 1990s -- even while making eight straight  
postseason appearances -- the Braves struggled to find a regular 
closer, a shortcoming often cited as one of the reasons they 
claimed just one World Series title. 
</P>
<P>
	Smoltz was willing to accept a role in the bullpen, but the  
Braves decided against such a drastic move. 
</P>
<P>
	``At that time, the bullpen was struggling and going through  
some tough times,'' he recalled. ``I suggested it, but Bobby turned 
me down. I always felt if I was given the opportunity, I could do 
what it takes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He won't get any argument from the Mets, who faced a gauntlet  
that began with 18-game winner Kevin Millwood (7 2-3 innings, five 
hits, two earned runs), continued with regular closer John Rocker 
for the final two outs in the eighth and ended with the stunning 
sight of Smoltz pitching the final inning after 380 major league 
appearances as a starter. 
</P>
<P>
	At first, the Turner Field crowd booed when Cox emerged from the  
dugout to take Rocker out of the game. The jeers quickly turned to 
cheers when they saw No. 29 jogging in from the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure they didn't know what was going on,'' Smoltz said.  
``I didn't know what was going on. I didn't know what to do -- walk 
in, run in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He did just fine once he reached the mound. Shawon Dunston  
grounded out, Roger Cedeno flied out and pinch-hitter Bobby Bonilla 
was called out on strikes to end the game, with Smoltz's fastball 
registering at 96 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	In Game 3 of the division series, Cox used both Greg Maddux and  
Millwood during a crucial 5-3 victory over the Astros. Millwood 
picked up the first save of his career with a scoreless 12th 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Against the Mets, Millwood was back in the familiar role of  
starter, leaving in the eighth with one out and the tying run at 
second. Cox called on Rocker to face New York's two most dangerous 
left-handed hitters, John Olerud and Robin Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
	The strategy worked to perfection as Rocker struck out both,  
preserving Atlanta's one-run lead, before returning to the mound to 
begin the ninth. That was merely a ploy to force the Mets to send 
up the right-handed Dunston as a pinch-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
	As soon as Dunston's name was announced, Cox called on Smoltz.  
</P>
<P>
	``I knew if I got the first hitter out, that would take care of  
my nerves,'' the starter-turned-reliever said. ``I knew that from 
all my experience with the role, which was none. Actually, I was 
looking at it like I was trying to close out a game as a starter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cox said all of his starters have the mentality to work out of  
the bullpen. He took a plunge into that brave new world last year, 
using Maddux to save a victory in Game 5 of the NLCS. 
</P>
<P>
	Just two games into this year's championship series, Tom Glavine  
is the only starter who hasn't gotten a chance to pitch in relief. 
He will start Friday night's game. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to have a good makeup and you have to be kind of  
special,'' Cox said. ``I'm sure a lot of pitchers could do it, but 
these guys have pretty good stuff, too. You kind of want to get 
them in there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smoltz's relief appearance overshadowed another strong  
performance by Millwood, who was following up the first 
complete-game one-hitter in the postseason since 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought my stuff was some of the worst I've had in a  
while,'' he said. ``But that's what it takes. Even on days when you 
don't have your best stuff, you've got to go out and pitch. Last 
year, if I had the same stuff I had today, I probably would have 
not made it past the second inning.''

<HEADLINE> FEMA Buying Flood-Damaged Property </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- In what might be the biggest program of its  
kind, state and federal officials expect to spend up to $600 
million buying properties and relocating people out of the path of 
future catastrophic floods like the one spawned by Hurricane Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to help North Carolinians rebuild. And we want to help  
them rebuild out of harm's way -- out of the flood plain,'' said 
John Copenhaver, regional director of the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``FEMA has done buyouts before. But this buyout is designed to  
be faster and larger in scope than any others.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Tolbert, state emergency management director, said Thursday  
the buyouts are expected to cost $500 million to $600 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Two buyout projects -- in Kinston and Goldsboro -- already have  
been approved. Officials have met with leaders from 15 communities 
and plan to meet with officials from at least 60 more communities 
in eastern North Carolina in the next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan is expected to surpass the 8,000 buyouts that followed  
Hurricane Fran in 1996. Tolbert said Thursday that 15,280 homes 
have been reported uninhabitable because of the flooding, and 6,344 
of them have been described as destroyed by their owners. 
</P>
<P>
	People whose properties are approved for the buyouts will be  
offered fair-market, pre-flood values for their properties, said 
Gavin Smith, the state's disaster mitigation director. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the program, buyout applications will be made by local  
communities, and not individual property owners, who must contact 
local officials if they wish to participate.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Up Against Yen, Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose against the yen in New York  
Thursday, a day after the Bank of Japan moved to increase the 
amount of yen on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 107.35  
Japanese yen, up from 106.60 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar has been gaining back ground against the yen after  
Japan's central bank said it would begin buying short-term 
government securities to make sure money keeps flowing through the 
economy. That would increase the amount of yen in the market, and 
could help stem the Japanese currency's recent strength against the 
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0781, down from  
$1.0794 late Wednesday. The euro had been drifting higher in recent 
days amid sharp drops on Wall Street, but the dollar held its own 
Thursday as stocks staged a mild rebound. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4741 Swiss francs, up from  
1.4734, and 1.4810 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4818. The British 
pound rose to $1.6642 from $1.6559. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Thursday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8141 German 
marks, up from 1.8118; 6.0844 French francs, up from 6.0765; and 
1,796.00 Italian lire, up from 1,793.67.

<HEADLINE> Policy Delayed on Fining Doctors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A physicians group backed away Thursday from a  
controversial plan to fine its doctors $250 for each day a patient 
is hospitalized when ``not medically necessary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fine, which had been scheduled to take effect Nov. 1,  
outraged many of the 350 physicians in the Mount Auburn Cambridge 
Independent Practice Association Inc., a network of doctors that 
contract with HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
	But a statement from the association said the policy would be  
delayed ``to give us more time for further discussion and education 
of our members.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The statement also said the policy, described in a front-page  
story in Thursday's Boston Globe, had been ``carefully reviewed by 
medical leadership'' before being adopted. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our intent remains the same -- to try to improve the quality  
and value of care we deliver to patients,'' the statement said. 
``We believe that the practice of good medicine requires us to be 
mindful of our limited resources. We believe good medicine should 
also be efficient and effective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Rob Janett, medical director of the practice, did not return  
repeated calls for comment about the turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
	According to an internal memorandum about the policy obtained by  
the Globe, the fines would be levied after case managers identified 
hospital stays they thought were unnecessarily long. The case 
managers would call the patient's doctor and suggest alternative 
treatments. In the case of a dispute, a committee of Mount Auburn 
doctors would decide whether the doctor should be docked. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a sad comment on how far downhill the health care  
system has gone that some doctors might think this was OK,'' said 
Dr. David Himmelstein, an internist in the group. ``There's no 
question that when you put doctors under pressure to get their 
patients out (of the hospital), there will be mistakes made 
eventually and it will harm someone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Michael Grodin, who heads the medical ethics program at  
Boston University, called the plan ``among the stupidest things 
I've seen in a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's based on an assumption that doctors and patients together  
are somehow trying to work the system so they can stay in the 
hospital longer,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> MGM Grand Chariman Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- J. Terrence Lanni resigned Thursday as chairman  
and chief executive of MGM Grand Inc., the Las Vegas-based casino 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement, which had been rumored for some time, came in  
a conference call of casino analysts in which the company reported 
third quarter earnings that far exceeded analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Lanni said he was leaving to spend more time with his family,  
which has remained in California. But he said he would remain with 
the company as a director and consultant. The resignation is 
effective at the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will probably take a full-time position with another company  
in another industry in Los Angeles, and I have no intention of 
competing with MGM Grand,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lanni noted he's had ``a split personal life,'' maintaining  
homes in Las Vegas and Los Angeles, and spending as much time as 
possible with his wife and two teen-age sons who are enrolled in 
schools in California. 
</P>
<P>
	Lanni, 56, built Caesars World Inc. into the best-recognized  
brand in gaming, serving as president of that company from April 
1981 to February 1995. He resigned when the company was purchased 
by ITT Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	A month later, billionaire Kirk Kerkorian -- who owns about 60  
percent of MGM Grand -- hired Lanni as the company's president. By 
June 1995, Lanni was joined by Alex Yemenidjian, a top Kerkorian 
aide. The next month, Lanni was named MGM Grand chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Lanni and Yemenidjian began planning transformation of MGM  
Grand's 5,005-room hotel-casino into the ``City of Entertainment,'' 
a $700 million-plus makeover that has made the Strip property one 
of the most successful in the business. 
</P>
<P>
	Lanni oversaw MGM Grand's expansion into the Detroit market  
earlier this year and acquisition of Primadonna Resorts Inc., its 
joint venture partner in construction of the New York-New York 
hotel-casino here. 
</P>
<P>
	He also led the company's expansion into South Africa and  
supervised construction of The Mansion at MGM Grand, a complex of 
29 luxury villas aimed a luring the world's super-rich high rollers 
to the MGM. 
</P>
<P>
	Lanni said an announcement on his successor would be made before  
the end of the year. There's speculation Yemenidjian, who serves as 
president of the casino company and chairman of MGM studios -- also 
controlled by Kerkorian -- may assume the top post at MGM Grand.

<HEADLINE> Russian Wins Men's Gymnast Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TIANJIN, China (AP) -- Russian gymnast Nikolay Krukov soared on  
the vault and uneven bars and kept his cool through the final floor 
exercises, winning the men's all-around world championship today. 
</P>
<P>
	For the women's gold medal, Romania's Maria Olaru twisted her  
way through superior vaults on her final routine and narrowly 
defeated Ukraine's Viktoria Karpenko. Russia's Elena Zamolodchikova 
also made no mistakes in her final routine, in the floor exercises, 
and edged teammate Elena Produnova for the bronze medal. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks to scores of 9.725 on the vault and 9.712 on the bars,  
the 20-year-old Krukov, a member of Russia's 1996 Olympic gold 
medal team, led going into the final round. His clean floor 
exercise routine earned him 9.437 and a total of 57.485. Japan's 
Naoya Tsukahara, the 1997 bronze medalist, followed him on the 
floor with a 9.500 and a total of 57.337. 
</P>
<P>
	American Blaine Wilson missed the bronze by 0.001 points.  
Bulgaria's Jordan Jovtchev finished with just 9.350 on the uneven 
bars for a total of 57.212, and Wilson couldn't catch him with a 
final 9.487 on the pommel horse. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champion Ivan Ivankov of Belarus went off the high bar  
on his opening routine, then landed on his seat at the end. He 
withdrew with a pulled groin muscle. Russia's Alexei Bondarenko, 
the 1997 silver medalist, finished 10th at 56.737. 
</P>
<P>
	Lu Yufu, a member of China's world champion team, finished fifth  
at 57.086. 
</P>
<P>
	Greek gymnast Ioannis Melissanidis earned the night's single  
highest score, a 9.837 on the vault, but finished 29th in the 
35-man field with 53.161. 
</P>
<P>
	In the women's competition, Romanian Andreea Raducan, whose  
9.837 floor exercise was the best performance of the day, finished 
fifth, ahead of China's Dong Fangxiao and Huang Mandan, and 
American Elise Ray. 
</P>
<P>
	Olaru and Karpenko went into their last of the four events, the  
vault, with Karpenko leading 29.212 to 29.149. 
</P>
<P>
	After Karpenko scored 9.493, the 17-year-old Olaru topped that  
with 9.625 -- the second-best vault of the day -- and took the gold 
38.774 to 38.705. Olaru also had the second-best floor exercise -- 
9.825 -- plus 9.737 on the balance beam and 9.587 on the uneven 
bars. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe it,'' Olaru said. ``Are you sure I am the  
world champion?'' 
</P>
<P>
	She won, she said, because ``I was simply more stable.''  
</P>
<P>
	Newcomers Olaru and the 16-year-old Raducan had been the top two  
scorers in qualifying and the team finals, where Romania won its 
fourth consecutive world team title. 
</P>
<P>
	Coming into her final routine on the uneven bars in fourth  
place, Raducan scored 9.612 for a total of 38.617. 
</P>
<P>
	But Zamolodchikova scored 9.787 on the floor, and Produnova then  
beat that with 9.812, giving Zamolodchikova a total of 38.687 and 
Produnova 38.673. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champion Svetlana Khorkina, whose fall from the  
balance beam cost Russia the team title, was 12th with 37.611. 
</P>
<P>
	Injuries plagued the American team. National champion Kristen  
Maloney had to drop out after spraining her knee in a fall from the 
bars Wednesday. It was on her right leg, where she had a stress 
fracture last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray competed with a sprained finger on her right hand, also  
sustained in practice Wednesday. She finished eighth with 38.017, 
including 9.662 on the floor, just 0.001 point behind China's 
Huang. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was such an exciting experience,'' said the 17-year-old  
Ray, sixth in the U.S. championships this year. ``You really can't 
know that until you're really out there, and I just want to do it 
all over again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vanessa Atler was hampered by ankle pains from an injury at the  
Pan Am Games this summer. She finished 31st in the 36-woman field 
with 35.731, then hobbled off with her left ankle packed in ice. 
She said ``it just hurt real bad'' on every push-off and landing. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Ray and Atler were competing in their first World  
Championships.

<HEADLINE> Alabama-Mississippi Rivalry Renews </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) -- If the timing was right, Mike DuBose and  
David Cutcliffe could be working together instead of against each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
	When DuBose was filling out his staff at Alabama in 1997, he  
tried to persuade Cutcliffe to return to his alma mater as 
offensive coordinator. Cutcliffe was in the same position at 
Tennessee, and didn't think the timing was right for him to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	``We talked at a time when I was really focused on what was  
going on at Tennessee. At that period of time, I was very involved 
with the players,'' Cutcliffe said. ``We felt like we were headed 
in a direction at Tennessee and I wanted to finish the job that I 
had started.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three years later, Cutcliffe is now in his first season as head  
coach at No. 22 Mississippi (5-1, 2-1 Southeastern Conference). 
He'll go head-to-head with DuBose on Saturday when the Rebels play 
host to No. 11 Alabama (4-1, 3-0). 
</P>
<P>
	``Our friendship goes way back, longer than either of us would  
like to admit, to our college days at the University of Alabama in 
the 1970s,'' DuBose said. ``Aside from the friendship, I have a 
tremendous amount of respect for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two never played football together because an injury  
prevented Cutcliffe from actually competing at Alabama. But 
Cutcliffe was still a part of the program and his coaching career 
followed a path close to DuBose's -- both started as high school 
coaches in Alabama before moving up the college ranks as 
assistants. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been competitors since our days as high school  
coaches,'' DuBose said. ``I've always admired and respected his 
career, in fact I thought so much of him I tried to hire him 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He almost got Cutcliffe, too.  
</P>
<P>
	Cutcliffe said he was ``certainly very serious'' about taking  
the Alabama job, but saw a national championship on Tennessee's 
horizon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a great deal of respect for Mike ... and what he was  
going to do,'' Cutcliffe said. ``But it just wasn't the right 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ironically, Cutcliffe never won that championship with  
Tennessee. The Vols fell short in 1997, and by the time they won it 
in 1998, Cutcliffe was no longer there. He left a few weeks before 
the national title game to take over at Ole Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	But Cutcliffe doesn't feel like he missed out on anything at  
Tennessee, partly because of the success he's found at Ole Miss. He 
took over in time for the Rebels' bowl game last season -- a 35-18 
win over Texas Tech -- and has them off to their best start since 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, as he prepares to face his friend and alma mater for the  
first time as a head coach, Cutcliffe said it won't feel any 
different from his numerous games against the Crimson Tide as a 
Tennessee assistant. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the same feeling. I know we are playing an awfully good  
football team,'' Cutcliffe said. ``I guess it's just been so long 
that it's hard to be any more emotional in one game than any other 
because they are all so emotionally tough.''

	HONG KONG (AP) -- Despite a second straight day of sharp losses  
on Wall Street, most Asian stock markets managed to edge higher 
Thursday, taking their cue from the region's largest bourse, Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese shares rose, albeit slightly, as investors welcomed  
news of a merger between two large Japanese banks, Sumitomo Bank 
and Sakura Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average climbed 25.77 points, or 0.15

Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Sumitomo-Sakura news has rekindled hopes for industry

investor buying interests aren't spreading.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wall Street overnight, the Dow Jones industrial average  
tumbled 1.77 percent, bringing its losses for the week to 3.9 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the U.S. dollar rose against the Japanese  
yen. In late trading, the dollar cost 107.27 yen, up 0.69 yen from 
106.58 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo and also above its overnight New 
York level of 106.60 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong shares, having suffered hefty falls in recent days,  
also rose slightly, lifted by Tokyo's gains. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 10.95 points, or 0.1 percent,  
to 12,486.82. The Hang Seng had lost 4.9 percent over the past 
three days, including a 2.2-percent drop Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But in Jakarta, share prices continued to fall as antigovernment  
student protests escalated in the Indonesian capital.

<P>
	SEOUL: South Korean shares rose, led by brokerage firms and

16.94 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,112.54.

<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian shares fell slightly, triggered by Wall  
Street's losses and a slide in Australian bond prices to two-year 
lows. The All Ordinaries Index closed at 2,901.3, down 5.4 points, 
or 0.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Taiwanese shares rose despite Wall Street losses and  
news that some leading Taiwan memory chipmakers may be hit by new 
U.S. antidumping duties of as high as 69 percent. The Weighted

	Retail Sales Rise in September  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Retail sales rose just 0.1 percent in  
September as U.S. consumers somewhat slowed their spending on cars 
and clothing from last month's buying frenzy. Forecasters had been 
looking for a 0.2 percent gain. But excluding the volatile 
automobile category, retail sales rose a brisk 0.6 percent. In a 
separate report, the Labor Department said the number of Americans 
filing for unemployment benefits last week fell by an unexpected 
29,000 to 285,000. Economists believe that jobless claims levels 
under 300,000 are an indication of an extremely tight labor market. 
Both reports heightened fears that the Federal Reserve will raise 
interest rates for the third time this year in an effort to keep 
inflation from escalating. The Fed's Open Market Committee will 
hold its next meeting on Nov. 16.

	GM Earns $877 Million

<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp. reported today that sales in  
North America and earnings from its finance arm pushed operating 
profit for the world's largest automaker to $877 million in the 
third quarter, reversing a strike-related loss from a year ago. GM 
earned $1.33 a share, compared with a loss of $309 million, or 52 
cents a share, for the July-through-September period of 1998, after 
excluding earnings from GM's former parts unit, Delphi Automotive 
Systems. Delphi was split off from GM in May as an independent 
company. The results beat analysts' predictions. 

</P>

	Charles Schwab Earnings Rise 27 Percent  
</P>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Earnings of Charles Schwab Corp. rose 27  
percent during the third quarter, as the nation's leading discount 
and online brokerage impressed Wall Street today with the growth of 
its new accounts. It reported a profit of $124.5 million or 15 
cents a share, for the quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with $97.8 
million or 12 cents a share, a year earlier. The figures met 
analysts' forecasts.

	MORRIS TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) -- AlliedSignal Inc. reported a 17  
percent increase in third-quarter earnings on growth in its 
aerospace and turbocharger businesses. The industrial products 
company, which plans to merge with Honeywell Inc., had earnings of 
$386 million, or 69 cents per share, compared with $329 million, or 
59 cents a share, for the same period in 1998. The results include 
an after-tax gain of $59 million from the sale of its laminate 
systems business and charges totaling $54 million for restructuring 
and other costs. When those one-time items are excluded, 
AlliedSignal's earnings came to 68 cents per share, matching

a share, compared to $160.7 million, or 81 cents a share, in the

Tyco's stuck plunging about 8 percent, down 8 at 88. David Tice, a

	IRS Says Tax Delay Could Be Costly  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Because of delay in Congress, the Internal  
Revenue Service says it faces up to $11.5 million in extra printing 
and mailing costs, and risks confusing taxpayers over how to deal 
with the alternative minimum tax. IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti 
has told congressional leaders in a letter that the IRS will do its 
best to help every taxpayer who needs help. But millions of 
middle-class taxpayers who claim personal credits such as the $500 
per-child credit could be required to calculate both their regular 
income taxes and alternative minimum taxes unless Congress acts to 
exempt those credits from applying to the AMT. An estimated 1 
million of those taxpayers could get hit with unexpectedly higher 
income taxes. A one-year exemption passed last year has expired. 
The House and Senate are far from agreement on legislation to 
extend it.

<HEADLINE> Yanks-Sox Matchup Like a Chessmatch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP ) -- The final score was 3-2, but the real result  
was more like ``Checkmate, in nine moves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The eighth inning of Thursday night's Game 2 of the AL  
championship series as much a chess match as a baseball game, as 
Red Sox manager Jimy Williams used his entire bench to avoid a loss 
that would put Boston down two games to nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	But Yankees manager Joe Torre was Bobby Fischer to Williams'  
Garry Kasparov, outmaneuvering his Red Sox counterpart to protect 
New York's 3-2 victory and head to Boston two games up. 
</P>
<P>
	After Troy O'Leary led off the eighth with a double off Mike  
Stanton -- missing a homer by about six inches -- Jeff Nelson 
relieved and hit Mike Stanley with a pitch. Damon Buford ran for 
Stanley. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Varitek sacrificed the runners to second and third. The  
Red Sox announced that lefty Scott Hatteberg would pinch hit for 
righty Darren Lewis and took one ball. Torre then brought in Allen 
Watson, and Lou Merloni pinch hit for Hatteberg, drawing an 
intentional walk to load the bases. 
</P>
<P>
	Butch Huskey hit for Trot Nixon, Ramiro Mendoza relieved, and  
Donnie Sadler -- Boston's last position player -- ran for Merloni. 
Huskey struck out on a 1-2 pitch, then Offerman hit an easy fly 
ball to center field. 
</P>
<P>
	When Daubach, who had been the designated hitter, played first  
base, it meant that the pitcher would have to bat if Huskey's spot 
came up in the order.

	Source: Starr To Step Down Next Week  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With his five-year, $47 million investigation  
of the Clintons winding down, Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr 
will formally step aside next week and be replaced by one of his 
assistants, Robert Ray, sources familiar with Starr's plans said 
tonight. Ray, a federal prosecutor who joined Starr's office early 
this year, was selected by a panel of three federal appeals court 
judges to succeed the controversial special prosecutor, the sources 
told The Associated Press. The judges have not issued a formal 
order yet, but they told the prosecutor's office of their plans 
this week, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

people in Cuba were forced to evacuate. At 8 p.m. EDT, Irene was 
centered slightly south of Havana and about 200 miles south 
southwest of Fort Myers, Fla. It was moving north-northwest at 7 
mph. Forecasters said they couldn't predict which track the storm 
would take. Irene -- which had sustained winds of 75 mph -- could hit

	SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Chile today formally asked Britain to  
release former dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet, saying he should be 
allowed to return home due to his deteriorating health. It marks 
the first time that Chile has formally requested clemency for its 
former leader. Previously, the Chilean government pressed for 
Pinochet's release on other grounds, arguing that he had immunity 
from prosecution and that foreign courts had no jurisdiction in his 
case. A British magistrate ruled last week that Pinochet can be 
extradited to Spain to stand trial for alleged human rights abuses 
during his rule.

emergency, dissolving parliament and suspending the constitution. 
Troops ousted Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Tuesday. World 
governments have been pressing Musharraf to reinstate democracy, 
even if he does not bring back Sharif.

	Bradley Discusses Endorsement Loss

<P>
	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- Democratic presidential candidate Bill  
Bradley dismissed concerns today that losing the AFL-CIO 
endorsement was a blow to his campaign, saying it was more an 
example of Vice President Al Gore's ``entrenched power.'' Gore won 
the endorsement yesterday, but it was far from unanimous as the 
Teamsters -- the largest of the AFL-CIO's 68 union affiliates -- and 
United Auto Workers broke ranks in opposition. ``Would I rather 
have had it? Sure. But is the loss of it a serious blow? No, I 
don't think so,'' Bradley said.

	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Unable to persuade New Hampshire to  
change its primary date, Iowa's Republican and Democratic leaders 
announced plans today to move their state's leadoff caucuses to 
Jan. 24, a week earlier than planned. The Iowa caucuses had been 
set for Jan. 31, but New Hampshire officials unexpectedly scheduled 
their primary on Feb. 1. They refused to push it back to Feb. 8 
despite the entreaties of Iowa officials. Roughly 75 percent of the 
delegates will be picked by March 7, and both parties are virtually 
certain to have a nominee within six weeks of Iowa's opening test.

<HEADLINE>  Dodge Returns to Winston Cup Racing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With top NASCAR crew chief Ray Evernham as its  
point man, Dodge will return to Winston Cup racing in 2001 after 16 
seasons on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler, the parent company of Dodge, announced Thursday  
that the Evernham-owned team would receive full factory support. 
</P>
<P>
	Evernham, who resigned last month after guiding Jeff Gordon to  
three championships in seven seasons, says he will have a two-car 
operation in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	But Evernham, who called the shots for the first 47 of Gordon's  
49 career victories, isn't ready not make any announcements 
concerning drivers or other personnel for his team. 
</P>
<P>
	He would have been happy to do so, however, had he been able to  
get the driver he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guy I'd love to have just signed a lifetime contract,''  
Evernham said referring to Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
	Evernham did say he will be looking at veterans and newcomers  
both in and out of the car to form a team. 
</P>
<P>
	He is excited by the prospect of being Dodge's flagship car  
owner. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no other opportunity I would have left the Hendrick  
team and Jeff Gordon for,'' Evernham said. ``The opportunity to 
start with a clean slate was to good to pass by.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And' he's like his car to do a lot of passing, right from the  
start. 
</P>
<P>
	``My goal is to get to Victory Lane and take the Dodge people  
with me,'' Evernham said, standing near a sign that read 493 -- the 
number of days until the season-opening 2001 Daytona 500. 
</P>
<P>
	Evernham said part of his job will be to help develop other  
Dodge teams as they come along. NASCAR is hoping their will be 
several. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal, according to Lou Patane, vice president of motorsports  
operations for Dodge, is to field between six and eight cars with 
two multicar teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dodge's return will increase competition, and certainly make  
it deeper,'' said Mike Helton, senior vice president for the 
sanctioning body, who says the choice of Evernham was a natural. 
``With one of the greatest talents in modern NASCAR history, it'll 
be interesting,'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Intrepid models Evernham will field will be the first  
Chrysler products in NASCAR's top division since Sept. 15, 1985, 
when Maurice Randall finished last in one of two Chryslers entered 
in the Delaware 500 at Dover Downs International Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	The last Dodge in a Winston Cup race finished 30th with Phil  
Good behind the wheel on June 9, 1985 at Pocono International 
Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
	Chrysler had a tradition of victory in NASCAR. Petty  
Enterprises, its most prolific winner ever, had 237 of its 271 
victories in Chrysler brands. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Petty himself had 175 of his record 200 career victories  
and six of his series-best seven championships in Plymouths and 
Dodges. 
</P>
<P>
	But the auto maker withdrew tech and parts support in the late  
'70s. Petty went winless in 1978, and jumped to General Motors the 
next year, leaving the few remaining Chrysler cars in the hands of 
underfunded independents. 
</P>
<P>
	The late Neil Bonnett accounted for the last Dodge victory, in  
the Los Angeles Times 500 on Nov. 20, 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	Chrysler began its comeback in the sport when Dodges were  
campaigned in the NASCAR truck series in 1995. Since factory 
backing began in 1997, Dodges have won seven races. 
</P>
<P>
	Evernham will continue to race in the Busch series with Gordon  
at the GEM (Gordon/Evernham Motorsports) team, but will not compete 
Dodges.. GEM uses Chevrolets.

<HEADLINE> Blind Workers' Jobs May Be Saved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government's temporary decision to keep  
eight supply facilities open may save the jobs of 1,400 blind 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	But advocates for the blind are not cheering.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good move in the right direction,'' said Jim Gibbons,  
president of the National Industries for the Blind, the parent 
organization for 88 associations that provide jobs and services to 
the blind. But ``there is still uncertainty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The facilities, which distribute products made by the blind to  
federal agencies, were to begin closing this month. But unions for 
2,000 other federal workers at the facilities persuaded the General 
Services Administration to reconsider. 
</P>
<P>
	GSA is ``turning back the clock'' to mid-May, before the  
facilities were set to close, Administrator David Barram said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But the agency, the government's landlord and purchasing agent,  
has not necessarily decided to keep the depots open. The 
administration must find a way to make the facilities, which lose 
$100,000 a day, more economical, Barram said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will rejuvenate our partnerships with our unions and have  
an important, honest discussion with them to examine the problems 
and directions in our distribution system,'' he added in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Gibbons said the decision gives blind advocates more time to  
find other outlets to sell their products -- from computer disks to 
mops -- possibly using e-commerce. GSA is assisting with an online 
store. 
</P>
<P>
	Adhering to a 1938 law, the government gives special  
consideration to organizations that sell products -- of competitive 
price and quality -- made by the blind. This group's unemployment 
rate is more than 70 percent, advocates for the blind say. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Barram said GSA would review the closures' effect on  
blind workers and make sure ``we didn't do anything inadvertent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He expects the GSA and the unions to come to an agreement on the  
fate of the supply facilities by the end of the month.

<HEADLINE> Dole Helps Present World Food Prize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Elizabeth Dole avoided traditional  
political venues while campaigning in Iowa on Thursday as she 
helped present the World Food Prize. 
</P>
<P>
	Recalling her experiences as Transportation Secretary and  
director of the American Red Cross, she urged a focus on seemingly 
mundane topics such as food distribution, far less flashy than 
scientific breakthroughs that can revolutionize food production. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those involved in famine and disaster relief know only too  
well the hardships imposed by the lack of transportation and 
communications systems,'' said Dole, who is seeking the Republican 
presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Food Prize is given annually to mark the greatest  
achievements in finding ways to feed a fast-growing world. This 
year's award went to a British scientist who developed a vaccine 
against a deadly livestock disease. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations said the world's population hit 6 billion  
this week, doubling since 1950. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole for years has been an adviser to the group and is close to  
Des Moines businessman John Ruan, who underwrites the prize. Ruan 
also is a major Republican fund-raiser and one of Dole's most 
prominent backers in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole said dealing with disasters taught her the need to focus on  
the hard realities of food production and distribution. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are resources that we in the United States take for  
granted, but inferior or nonexisting logistical facilities in many 
countries have a devastating impact on food security,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She also called on the scientific and technical experts meeting  
here to focus on ``assuring ways and means for government and 
humanitarian organizations around the world to effectively address 
these problems.''

<HEADLINE> NYC, DeNiro Can't Reach Studio Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The deal is off.  
</P>
<P>
	Five months after a celebratory press conference with Robert  
DeNiro and Miramax Films to trumpet a $150 million studio complex 
at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Wednesday 
that the city is doing business with someone else. 
</P>
<P>
	It has instead decided to sign with Steiner Equities of New  
Jersey and New York Studios to build a $120 million studio complex 
at the former shipbuilding center that closed in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is expected to bring in more money and the project can  
begin within a few months, Giuliani said. ``And they did not 
require a $25 million (city) loan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Rosenbaum, president of the city's Brooklyn Navy Yard  
Development Corporation, said the city ``never got a commitment 
from the DeNiro people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives for DeNiro and Miramax declined to comment.  
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear whether politics was a factor.  
</P>
<P>
	Miramax Films president Harvey Weinstein has a close  
relationship with first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, the mayor's 
likely opponent in a race for the U.S. Senate next year.

<TEXT>
<P>
	MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- A little bit of New York City turmoil has  
made it to the heart of blues country. 
</P>
<P>
	Singer-songwriter Jill Sobule of New York wrote and performed a  
song Thursday at the Associated Press Managing Editors conference, 
tweaking Mayor Rudolph Giuliani for his fervent opposition to an 
exhibit at the Brooklyn Museum of Art that includes a painting of 
the Virgin Mary decorated with dung. 
</P>
<P>
	The song, titled ``Call Rudy,'' includes the lyrics: ``Call Rudy  
if your art's a little queer, call Rudy, election year is near. 
Don't call the Whitney, don't call the Met, don't call MoMa, lest 
you forget. You can be a sensation on every news station, lines 
round the block to see your degradation. It's your duty, call 
Rudy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sobule performed the song during an APME panel discussion on  
music censorship. 
</P>
<P>
	Sobule, who scored a hit with her 1995 song ``I Kissed a Girl,''  
says she plans to record ``Call Rudy.''

<HEADLINE> Abu-Jamal Sentenced to Execution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Gov. Tom Ridge has signed another death  
warrant for Mumia Abu-Jamal, one that orders the execution of the 
former journalist and Black Panther in less than two months. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridge's action on Wednesday came less than two weeks after the  
U.S. Supreme Court rejected Abu-Jamal's request for a new trial in 
the killing of a Philadelphia police officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The warrant called for Abu-Jamal to be executed by injection  
Dec. 2. It was the second time Ridge had signed a death warrant for 
Abu-Jamal, whose case has prompted worldwide protests from 
death-penalty opponents who have challenged the fairness of his 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The previous warrant was stayed.  
</P>
<P>
	Abu-Jamal, 45, was convicted of first-degree murder in the 1981  
shooting of police officer Daniel Faulkner. 
</P>
<P>
	When they arrived at the scene, police found the dying officer,  
who was white, and a wounded Abu-Jamal lying near his own gun. 
Several witnesses identified him as the shooter and two people 
testified that Abu-Jamal confessed at the hospital. Abu-Jamal has 
denied making any confession. 
</P>
<P>
	Abu-Jamal's legal team announced plans to file an appeal Friday  
in federal court in Philadelphia. All of Abu-Jamal's previous 
appeals have been in state courts, with the final rejection by the 
Pennsylvania Supreme Court being appealed to the nation's highest 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the new warrant, Abu-Jamal is not likely to be executed  
soon, and the process of federal appeals could eventually lead back 
to the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Abu-Jamal's lawyers criticized Ridge for signing the execution  
warrant while they were contemplating another appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ridge is rushing to execute before all the evidence has been  
presented,'' said Abu-Jamal attorney Leonard Weinglass. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Jesse Jackson also issued a statement condemning the  
decision. ``I am disappointed that Gov. Ridge would seek revenge 
through capital punishment,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Clintons Get Mortgage for N.Y. Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and his wife secured  
substitute financing for their New York home Thursday, abandoning a 
plan to rely on prominent Democratic fund-raiser Terry McAuliffe 
for financial backing. 
</P>
<P>
	``After they had the initial contract ... they had an  
opportunity to look hard at different financing options,'' said Jim 
Kennedy, spokesman for the White House counsel's office. ``This 
home purchase has had a fair amount of publicity and I think 
stimulated a lot of offers from different mortgage companies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, have  
said criticism of the loan guarantee Clinton and his wife, Hillary, 
secured from their friend McAuliffe spurred them to seek other 
options. Kennedy declined to comment on the criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	``They became aware of some different financing options and they  
looked into them and settled on this one as making the most sense 
for them,'' Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons sought the $1.7 million house in Chappaqua to allow  
Mrs. Clinton to establish residency in anticipation of her bid for 
a Senate seat next year. They expect to close on the property Nov. 
1. 
</P>
<P>
	The new $1.36 million loan from PNC Mortgage Corp. of America is  
a conventional 30-year adjustable rate mortgage, but the interest 
rate is locked in at 7.5 percent for the first three years, Kennedy 
said. Later, the rate will adjust annually to reflect the one-year 
Treasury bill rate plus 2.75 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington gadfly Larry Klayman, chairman of Judicial Watch,  
which sued to block the Clintons' original loan deal, said the 
group would expand its suit to examine the new arrangement. Klayman 
is critical because the loans are greater than the Clintons can 
currently afford. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Clintons are clearly entitled to live in New York if they  
so please; however, they should secure a house within their means 
and not look to others, seeking to buy influence,'' Klayman said.

<HEADLINE> Reform Party Riddled With Factions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- As the competition begins for the Reform  
Party presidential nomination, the candidates will find a landscape 
littered with factionalism, local rivalries and mistrust. 
</P>
<P>
	That's been underscored in state conventions the party has held,  
amid signs that some in the party are building walls to keep out 
backers of commentator Pat Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really is hypocrisy,'' said Donna Donovan, of the  
Connecticut Reform Party. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue takes on new urgency with reports that Buchanan later  
this month will bolt the Republican Party and instead seek the 
presidency under the Reform Party banner. 
</P>
<P>
	His path to that nomination will be complicated, with some in  
the party reluctant to turn over the levers of power without a 
fight. Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura is the party's top elected 
official, and he has his faction, among others. 
</P>
<P>
	Factional fighting marked a party convention in Connecticut, and  
a similar gathering in New Hampshire was postponed when it became 
clear Buchanan backers would jam the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The Iowa Reform Party is preparing for its convention this  
weekend, and there's a history of factionalism in that group that 
predates Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Young, a top official of the Iowa party, is pushing to limit  
who participates. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's no effort to squeeze out anybody,'' insists Young. ``I  
revised the rules so someone couldn't storm the doors and take over 
the party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young argues that participants should be voters who were  
registered in the Reform Party for the last election, or who were 
``visibly active in the party'' as of Sept. 16, one month before 
the state convention. 
</P>
<P>
	That, of course, would keep any Buchanan backers from playing a  
role, and there's a distinctly Minnesota flavor to the convention. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick McCluhan, chairman of the Minnesota Reform Party, talks at  
lunch, while Minnesota Lt. Gov. Mae Schunk is keynoting. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really driven by what could happen if we let these people  
in,'' said Donovan. ``I think that if there are these kind of 
activities going on, now is the time to bring them to light and 
address them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Donovan said her concerns were that Young and his faction were  
seeking to block new entrants to the Reform Party at a time when it 
should be growing. 
</P>
<P>
	Sherry Blue, who says she's running to head the Iowa Reform  
Party, argues for a far more open process, letting anyone 
participate who is willing to sign a statement backing the party. 
</P>
<P>
	The party descended from Ross Perot's United We Stand operation  
and has a history of factionalism, splitting into warring camps on 
several occasions. The party lost its ballot status in the last 
election, and now has ballot access in only 21 states. 
</P>
<P>
	There also are serious questions about the party's impact. As of  
the last election, there were exactly 922 registered Reform party 
voters in Iowa, out of a registered voter universe of 1.9 million. 
It also is beginning to draw perennial candidates who have been 
associated with fringe causes. Sue Atkinson is an organizer and 
she's been associated with extremist Lyndon LaRouche. 
</P>
<P>
	The American public has reservations about Buchanan as a  
candidate, saying by a 2-1 margin, 44 percent to 22 percent, that 
he is too extreme to be president in an ABC News poll out Thursday. 
Those most likely to feel that way were older, better educated and 
wealthier. The poll of 1,007 adults was taken Oct. 6-10 and has an 
error margin of plus or minus 3 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	While Young heads the Iowa party, he splits his time between  
Iowa and Virginia and also holds a national party post. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Reform Party increasingly is seen as a joke,'' said Drake  
University political science professor Dennis Goldford. ``They just 
haven't been a force here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Perot got as much as 18 percent of the vote, polls this  
year have seen Buchanan drawing only 9 percent in a projected 
three-way matchup. 
</P>
<P>
	Young argued that there's no agenda involved in the Reform Party  
machinations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of simple,'' said Young. ``It is designed  
specifically to avoid an unfriendly takeover.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He insists all are welcome.  
</P>
<P>
	``I happen to like Pat Buchanan,'' said Young. ``I like Jesse  
Ventura. I don't really have the luxury of my own ideology.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It should be noted that the state conventions are the mechanism  
used to pick a party presidential nominee, but the battling that's 
going on indicates the sort of struggle that Buchanan and others 
will have to sort through to seize control of the party. 
</P>
<P>
	The party will select its nominee through a unique, mail-in  
ballot next summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Names other than Buchanan have been mentioned. Ventura has said  
he isn't running, but suspicions remain. Developer Donald Trump has 
expressed an interest as well.

<HEADLINE> Retiree Pleads Innocent to Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- A 75-year-old man was charged with murder  
Thursday for allegedly giving his terminally ill wife a fatal dose 
of medication and then placing her in a car with the engine running 
and garage door shut. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas James May sat with his 69-year-old wife, Hazel, and  
passed out from the fumes, police said. He awoke five hours later 
and called their daughter, who contacted authorities. The couple 
had been married 46 years. 
</P>
<P>
	May pleaded innocent at his arraignment and was ordered held  
without bail. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Robert Madruga said there was no evidence the death  
was an assisted suicide as May told police when he was arrested 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``She never at any time to our knowledge indicated a desire to  
die,'' Madruga said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the scene, May told police that his wife, who was in the late  
stages of Lou Gehrig's disease, left notes that suggested she 
wanted to die. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor asked Superior Court Judge Roger Kraul to order  
May held without bail in part out of fear he would attempt to take 
his own life, as he apparently was trying to do the night of his 
wife's death. 
</P>
<P>
	Madruga said he interviewed the couple's three grown children,  
reviewed notes left at the scene and decided to file a murder 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
	May has no criminal record. He retired from the Navy as a  
commander in 1975 after a 20-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Jo Barr, a court-appointed public defender, said the  
children may not have known their mother's true wishes and that the 
notes are ``subject to interpretation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is a mercy killing,'' Barr said. ``Some people  
would call that murder. I wouldn't.''

<HEADLINE> Herbs Said Harmful Before Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Some popular herbal remedies can be dangerous if  
taken before surgery, doctors are warning. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers believe some of the most common herbal products  
might prolong the sedative effect of anesthesia, increase bleeding 
during surgery and cause fluctuations in blood pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	Patients should tell their surgeons about all herbal products  
they use, along with prescriptions and over-the-counter remedies, 
to avoid dangerous interactions, said Dr. Charles McLeskey, an 
anesthesiologist at Scott &AMP; White Memorial Hospital in Temple. 
</P>
<P>
	At a conference this week in Dallas of the American Society of  
Anesthesiologists, McLeskey presented results of a survey of 979 
presurgical patients. Seventeen percent said they take one of more 
herbal products. 
</P>
<P>
	The most common herbs listed were gingko biloba, garlic, ginger  
and ginseng -- all of which may prevent blood clots from forming and 
lead to excess blood loss in surgery. Two other popular herbs -- St. 
John's wort, an antidepressant, and kava-kava, a relaxant -- may 
prolong the sedative effect of anesthesia, McLeskey said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ASA suggests that patients stop taking herbal products at  
least two weeks before elective surgery and keep their doctors 
informed. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for the Council for Responsible Nutrition, which  
represents makers of dietary supplements, said patients should try 
to bring the bottles with them anytime they visit a doctor or 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime they are taking a dietary supplement they should  
mention that to their doctor,'' Cathy Fomus said. ``They can 
interact with food, with each other and other prescription drugs.''

<HEADLINE> McCourt, Morris Will Not Get Awards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The biggest names at this year's National Book  
Awards ceremony will not belong to the nominees. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Martin is scheduled to host next month's gathering in New  
York, marking the NBA's 50th anniversary, and Oprah Winfrey will 
receive an honorary prize for her ``influential contribution to 
reading and books.'' Past winners such as David McCullough and E. 
Annie Proulx are also expected to attend. 
</P>
<P>
	But most of the writers actually competing for awards are little  
known beyond the literary world, or even beyond their immediate 
communities. The nominees announced Wednesday include novelist Ha 
Jin, a former member of China's People's Liberation Army, and poet 
Louise Gluck, the only finalist this year who has ever won the NBA 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no glitz here,'' said Neil Baldwin, executive director  
of the National Book Foundation, a nonprofit organization which 
sponsors the awards. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the non-nominees were the authors of two of the year's  
most talked about books: Frank McCourt and Edmund Morris. 
</P>
<P>
	McCourt, who won the Pulitzer Prize for the million-selling  
``Angela's Ashes,'' has received much weaker reviews for his 
current memoir, ``'Tis.'' Morris won both the Pulitzer and the NBA 
for his biography of Theodore Roosevelt, but has been widely 
ridiculed for inserting himself as a fictional character in 
``Dutch,'' his biography of former President Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
	Ha Jin, a Chinese immigrant who now teaches at Emory University,  
is a fiction nominee for his novel ``Waiting.'' Andre Dubus III, 
son of the late fiction writer and essayist, was cited for his 
novel ``House of Sand and Fog.'' Other finalists include Kent 
Haruf, whose novel ``Plainsong'' is quickly emerging as a major 
critical and commercial favorite; Patricia Henley for ``Hummingbird 
House''; and Jean Thompson for the story collection ``Who Do You 
Love?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nonfiction finalists include Mark Bowden for ``Black Hawk Down:  
A Story of Modern War'' and Judith Thurman for ``Secrets of the 
Flesh,'' a biography of the French author Colette. Also nominated 
were Natalie Angier for ``Woman: An Intimate Geography,'' John W. 
Dower for ``Embracing Defeat: Japan in the Wake of World War II'' 
and John Phillip Santos for ``Places Left Unfinished at the Time of 
Creation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Gluck, cited for the collection ``Vita Nova,'' poetry  
finalists include Ai (real name Florence Anthony) for ``Vice: New 
and Selected Poems,'' Clarence Major for ``Configurations: New &AMP; 
Selected Poems 1958-1998,'' Sherod Santos for ``The Pilot Star 
Elegies'' and C.K. Williams for ``Repair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Louise Erdrich, overlooked for such acclaimed fiction as ``Love  
Medicine'' and ``Tracks,'' made it this year in the Young People's 
Literature category for ``The Birchbark House.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her fellow nominees are Laurie Halse Anderson for ``Speak,''  
Kimberly Willis Holt for ``When Zachary Beaver Came to Town,'' 
Polly Horvath for ``The Trolls'' and Walter Dean Myers for 
``Monster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The awards ceremony will be held Nov. 17. Each winner receives  
$10,000.

<HEADLINE> VD Dispute Holds Up Cancer Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A long-running dispute involving premarital  
sex, venereal disease and condoms is holding up legislation that 
would help uninsured women get treatment for breast and cervical 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is a bill that would allow Medicaid to help uninsured  
women who are diagnosed with breast or cervical cancer through a 
government program but who often have no money to pay for 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure is being held up by Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., who is  
insisting that the bill also address a common venereal disease 
called human papillomavirus, or HPV. About half of sexually active 
Americans have the disease, though most don't know it because there 
are no symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
	For a tiny percentage of these people, HPV can be deadly.  
Several strains of the disease -- which has about 80 total strains -- 
cause cervical cancer, and most people with cervical cancer got it 
from HPV. 
</P>
<P>
	Coburn, an obstetrician, is insisting that the cancer treatment  
bill mandate stepped-up monitoring of the virus, and he wants it to 
require new labels on condoms warning that they do not prevent 
transmission of HPV. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we're not going to label condoms, we shouldn't be labeling  
cigarettes or alcohol or anything else,'' he said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Women don't need to get cervical cancer anymore,'' he said.  
``We can stop it. But we can't stop it if we put our head in the 
sand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is that while condoms do not prevent HPV's  
transmission, nothing else does either -- short of abstinence. And 
that, Coburn says, is the real reason the federal government hasn't 
focused on the disease. To do so, he argues, would mean 
discouraging sex, which is ``not politically correct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not proper to say you shouldn't have intercourse outside  
of marriage, even though it's the only thing that's going to 
work,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials say they do their part to promote abstinence  
as the only sure way to avoid sexually transmitted diseases. But 
they say it's also important to tell people how to prevent the 
diseases that are preventable. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know that everyone is not going to be abstinent,'' said Dr.  
Helene Gayle, who oversees sexually transmitted diseases at the 
federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	Gayle doubts that condom labels are the best way to educate  
people about HPV. But if there are to be labels, she said, they 
should also explain condoms' benefit: They do help protect against 
the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
	Coburn disagrees. ``We've all been told how great condoms are,''  
he said. ``I'm wanting to label what they don't do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fighting HPV is complicated on medical as well as political  
fronts. Researchers don't know who among the millions of infected 
people will ultimately get cancer. And that makes monitoring the 
disease difficult, said Gayle, who met with Coburn Thursday to try 
to work out an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Coburn and the bill's Democratic sponsor, Rep. Anna Eshoo,  
D-Calif., were both optimistic that an agreement can be worked out 
so the bill's primary issue -- cancer treatment -- can move ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure, which has more than 270 co-sponsors, would allow  
federal Medicaid money to treat women who go through a federal 
screening program and are diagnosed with breast or cervical cancer. 
States, which pay part of the cost of Medicaid, would get a larger 
share of federal funding for this treatment if they chose to 
participate. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, which would cost $315 million over five years, is  
expected to help about 3,600 uninsured women each year.

<HEADLINE> Chamberlain Aura Lives in Philly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Julius Erving knew he'd be playing in Wilt  
Chamberlain's shadow when he arrived in Philadelphia in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	Everyone played in Wilt Chamberlain's shadow.  
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain was the native son, Erving the outsider who had to  
earn the city's praise. Dr. J didn't gain a true appreciation for 
the city's basketball giant until they went out to dinner years 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was his presence,'' Erving said. ``Going to dinner with  
him, he orders two complete dinners. There's entree one, and entree 
two; dessert one, and dessert two. I'd say, `Are you taking 
advantage of me because I'm buying?' And he'd say, `No, man, this 
is how I eat.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	It was some legacy to live up to. Philadelphia basketball,  
already rich in history before Wilton Norman Chamberlain was born 
in West Philly on Aug. 21, 1936, was never, ever the same. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coming into Philadelphia,'' Erving said, ``the aura of  
Chamberlain was there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still is.  
</P>
<P>
	They have been telling stories about Chamberlain in Philly since  
he first picked up a basketball at Shoemaker Junior High School at 
age 15. Erving heard them all when he soared into town, with his 
Afro and slam dunks no one had seen before. 
</P>
<P>
	Erving said he and Pat Williams, then the 76ers general manager,  
``had this very specific conversation about kind of blending in, 
that the era of a dominant guy like Chamberlain was over. That 
doesn't work in Philadelphia anymore. Chamberlain had the 
individual honors, and the Celtics had the championships.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain's teams lost four seventh games to Bill Russell's  
Boston Celtics, winning two championships during his prolific 
14-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chamberlain had the individual honors,'' Erving said, ``and  
the Celtics had the championships.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His path paved by Chamberlain, the lessons there to be learned,  
Erving's 76ers ended up with just as many titles as Chamberlain's -- 
one. They beat the Lakers in 1983, but lost to them in the finals 
in 1980 and '82. 
</P>
<P>
	``So in the end, we actually accomplished the same thing Wilt  
did,'' Erving said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain became part of Philadelphia basketball lore when he  
starred at Overbrook High School in the early '50s. He earned 
enough respect to leave his hometown -- for the University of Kansas 
and Harlem Globetrotters -- and come home again to play for the 
Philadelphia Warriors, and later the Sixers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't come in as a kid who grew up Philadelphia, as a kid  
who was born and raised, who left and came back,'' said Erving, a 
native New Yorker. ``I didn't have as much to prove as Chamberlain 
had to prove. My transition was easier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Erving played his entire NBA career in Philadelphia. By  
and large, he didn't hear the same criticism Chamberlain did. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anyone was really treated quite like Dr. J,''  
said Dick Jerardi of the Philadelphia Daily News. ``He couldn't do 
anything wrong. Even to Wilt, he was a Philly guy, but there was a 
reaction to him because he was so big. It was sort of, `Why didn't 
he win all the time?' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Barkley followed Erving as Philadelphia's next pro  
basketball icon, but never won and never gained the stature or 
acceptance that Dr. J or Chamberlain did. Allen Iverson, who last 
year became the first Sixers player since Chamberlain to win the 
NBA scoring title, is next. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wilt Chamberlain,'' Iverson said Wednesday, pausing for a long  
time. ``Words can't even describe the type of player he was. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not from my era, not even close,'' said Iverson, born in  
1974, a year after Chamberlain retired. ``I've heard so many 
stories about him, I feel like I knew him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Erving, Chamberlain's days in Philadelphia were not  
always smooth. 
</P>
<P>
	A year after leading the Sixers to a 68-13 record and the NBA  
title in 1966-67, Chamberlain's team lost again to Russell's 
Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
	According to one version, Chamberlain, who made $180,000 in  
1967-68, asked for a $1 million, three-year contract. The legend 
also has it that he wanted to be named player-coach to replace Alex 
Hannum and wanted a share in ownership of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain disputed this in one of his final interviews,  
produced by the Sixers in May. He said he turned down an offer to 
become the team's player-coach, then nearly quit basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came out here and I just told my family, `Well, I've had  
just about enough basketball. I'm going to give it up,' '' 
Chamberlain said. ``I was gone. Totally gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain was traded to the Lakers and led them to the NBA  
title in 1972. The Sixers were 9-73 the following season, the worst 
record in NBA history. The Dr. J era began three years later. 
</P>
<P>
	Erving, now executive vice president of the Orlando Magic,  
wishes he had one more chance to thank Chamberlain for paving the 
way. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had nowhere to hide,'' Erving said. ``At 6-6, I could hide.  
I could have some sense of normalcy. I don't think Wilt was allowed 
that.''

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Sets Oct. 25 Announcement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pat Buchanan's pitchfork brigade may be  
moving. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials close to the Republican presidential candidate,  
speaking on condition of anonymity, said Wednesday that the 
conservative commentator is preparing to leave the GOP and seek the 
Reform Party's presidential nomination Oct. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Two officials said plans were being made for Buchanan to make  
announcements in suburban Washington, New Hampshire and perhaps 
other key states. 
</P>
<P>
	They cautioned, however, that Buchanan could still reverse  
course and avoid the increasingly fractious third-party bid. But 
they said he intends to bolt the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
	And, in the clearest signal yet of his intentions, Buchanan's  
campaign mailed hundreds of invitations to supporters Tuesday night 
inviting them to a ``major announcement'' Oct. 25 at a Falls 
Church, Va., hotel, the officials said. As many as 3,000 
invitations also were being sent out for a New Hampshire stop, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's almost too far down the pike to get out now,'' said one  
of the officials. 
</P>
<P>
	However, spokeswoman Joanne Hansen said no final decision has  
been made. 
</P>
<P>
	Lagging in GOP polls, Buchanan says he believes the party's  
nomination battle is rigged in favor of Texas Gov. George W. Bush, 
who he says is too moderate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reform Party nominee would collect almost $13 million in  
federal matching money. Party founder Ross Perot earned 19 percent 
of the vote in 1992 and 8 percent in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans fear a third-party run by Buchanan would siphon  
conservative votes from their nominee. Buchanan, who calls his 
backers ``peasants with pitchforks'' and the ``Buchanan Brigade,'' 
won the New Hampshire primary in 1996 and put a scare into 
then-President George Bush in the 1992 primaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan, however, would not be assured the Reform Party  
nomination. A parade of celebrities and politicians are mentioned 
as potential candidates, including New York tycoon Donald Trump, 
Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, former Connecticut Gov. Lowell 
Weicker, actress Cybill Shepherd, actor Warren Beatty and Perot 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
	A new CNN/USA Today/Gallup Poll shows limited support for the  
third-party alternatives. Buchanan had the backing of 9 percent of 
those surveyed in a three-way matchup with Bush and Vice President 
Al Gore, the Democratic front-runner. Trump had 10 percent in a 
similar three-way matchup. 
</P>

	Ventura, the party's highest ranking elected official, has ruled

<HEADLINE> Computer Chip Sales Forecast Good </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The earthquake in Taiwan last month wasn't powerful enough to  
slow down global sales of computer chips this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Worldwide sales of computer chips are expected to grow 14  
percent to more than $155 billion in 1999, increasing for the first 
time in two years despite disruptions in supply caused by the 
quake, according to a forecast released today by Dataquest, the 
Santa Clara, Calif.-based research unit of the Gartner Group 
consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
	The annual double-digit sales growth will continue through 2002,  
driven by a strong global economy that is fueling demand for 
computers, consumer electronics and other chip-powered products, 
Dataquest prediicted. Last year, sales and chip prices were 
depressed by the economic slump in Asia, which has since eased. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of semiconductors are a closely-watched harbinger of  
health for the broader technology industry, where demand for 
everything from PCs to car stereos closely correlates to chip 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Taiwan earthquake sent tremors through factories that  
produce memory chips, the supply disruptions were temporary and 
many companies were able to tap alternate sources of chips outside 
Taiwan, said Dataquest analyst Ron Bohn. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the plants were not severely damaged,'' Bohn added.  
</P>
<P>
	Overall sales of semiconductors are expected to reach $251  
billion by 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of memory chips, which act as temporary storage bins for  
information in computers and other electronic devices, are a key 
reason why. Fueled by strong demand for PCs and other electronics 
products, memory chip sales are forecast to grow from $25 billion 
this year to $80 billion by 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Bohn says strong demand for chips is expected to end a worldwide  
glut of semiconductors, possibly driving up prices or at least 
stopping them from declining. 
</P>
<P>
	However, sales of semiconductors are forecast to level off in  
2003.

<HEADLINE> House GOP To Vote on Cigarette Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans are planning a floor vote  
next week on the cigarette tax increase and other revenue raisers 
in President Clinton's budget, putting on the spot Democrats who 
advocate higher taxes in order to boost spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to see if the president's Democratic brethren would  
be willing to support his tax increases,'' said Rep. Jerry Weller, 
R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	The move Wednesday came as the GOP leadership struggled to pass  
routine spending bills without dipping into the Social Security 
trust fund. Clinton also says he wants to keep those funds safe, 
but he has proposed 75 tax increases totaling a net $89.7 billion 
over 10 years to generate the revenue needed for more spending on 
health, education and other areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's budget includes a 55-cents-a-pack cigarette tax  
increase, a measure closing corporate tax shelters, and a $6.6 
billion reinstatement of a corporate environmental cleanup tax, 
among others. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Republican officials said the GOP leadership was  
confident Clinton's tax increases would be voted down on the House 
floor, just as his overall budget was resoundingly defeated earlier 
this year. House leaders have decided to hold the vote but have yet 
to determine the mechanics of bringing it to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats and the White House today dismissed the idea as  
gimmickry. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounds like, I'm afraid, another stunt, another effort at  
political advantage rather than sitting down and trying to figure 
out a budget,'' said House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Republican and tobacco-state lawmakers pledged on  
Wednesday to head off the proposed cigarette tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill Archer, chairman of the House Ways and Means  
Committee, released an analysis by the nonpartisan Joint Committee 
on Taxation showing that people earning less than $10,000 would see 
an effective 15 percent federal tax increase, compared with a 5 
percent average increase for all U.S. taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Raising taxes to afford the extra spending the president wants  
is not the appropriate thing to do,'' Archer, R-Texas, told 
reporters. ``It hits the hardest on the poor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few hours later, a bipartisan group of tobacco-state House  
members said they would fight any effort by Clinton or Democratic 
congressional leaders to use the cigarette tax to finance 
government spending or new programs such as Medicare prescription 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Enough is enough. That's the message the administration needs  
to hear,'' said Rep. Mike McIntyre, D-N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Barry Toiv, noting that a new Philip  
Morris Internet site finally acknowledges the health hazards of 
smoking, said Clinton will ``absolutely'' continue to push for the 
tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
	``Raising the price of tobacco is good health policy that will  
discourage young people from smoking,'' Toiv said. ``On a day that 
Philip Morris is admitting that smoking causes cancer, it's hard to 
believe that Chairman Archer still wants to protect this 
industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, House Democrats are seizing every opportunity to push  
a bill that would crack down on abuse of corporate tax shelters. 
</P>
<P>
	Even some Republicans are giving the measure a look, partly  
because it would raise an estimated $10.6 billion in revenue over 
10 years and help ease this year's budget crunch. 
</P>
<P>
	Business interests are intent on quietly killing the bill,  
fearing it might interfere with legitimate business transactions 
and give the IRS too much power. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all very much behind closed doors,'' said Rep. Lloyd  
Doggett, D-Texas, prime author of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this year, Democrats have tried to use the money  
Doggett's bill would raise as a way to pay for a tax cut, a managed 
care reform bill and a measure extending several expiring corporate 
tax credits. They are considering it as a way to pay for a proposed 
tax cut for businesses to ease costs from a $1 increase in the 
minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Rep. Charlie Norwood of Georgia, the main GOP sponsor  
of the managed care measure that passed the House, promoted the tax 
shelter crackdown to help offset its costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a large difference in what you call a tax increase  
and stopping bogus tax shelters,'' Norwood said during House Rules 
Committee debate on his bill. ``We are trying to keep them from 
cheating the system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Archer said Wednesday his panel will hold more hearings so  
Congress can ``find the right approach to where we don't eliminate 
legitimate business practices but we do get at any abuses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Doggett bill's central point is that, to be legal, a  
transaction should have some reasonable ``economic substance'' 
other than avoidance of taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, it would increase the penalty for tax  
underpayment from 20 percent to 40 percent for transactions that 
fail the test and would eliminate exceptions that protect company 
executives if a deal is OK'd by an attorney.

<HEADLINE> McGrw Hill Profits Up 19 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- McGraw-Hill Cos. reported a 19 percent increase  
in third-quarter earnings today, crediting strong publishing 
markets and continued growth at its Standard &AMP; Poor's financial 
services subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
	McGraw-Hill earned $190.5 million, or 96 cents a share, compared  
to $160.7 million, or 81 cents a share, in the same period a year 
ago. Revenues rose 9 percent to $1.32 billion from $1.21 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The results handily beat Wall Street estimates of 92 cents a  
share. McGraw-Hill's stock was up 63 cents at $51.88 on the New 
York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	McGraw-Hill president Harold McGraw III attributed the strong  
results to good market conditions in educational and professional 
publishing and continued growth at the company's biggest magazine, 
Business Week, and Standard &AMP; Poor's. 
</P>
<P>
	McGraw said S&AMP;P reaped benefits from expanding its line of  
services into new areas, including rating the financial strength of 
insurance companies and bank loans. S&AMP;P is best known for assigning 
risk ratings to bonds and for its stock indexes. 
</P>
<P>
	The S&AMP;P stock index business also posted stronger results amid  
higher trading of financial instruments based on the indexes, which 
include the widely quoted S&AMP;P 500 index of blue-chip U.S. stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's year-ago earnings were affected by three one-time  
factors -- a gain on the sale of real estate, a loss on early debt 
retirement and a write-down on the company's continuing education 
business. Without the special items, the company earned $162.9 
million or 82 cents per share in the third quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of the year, earnings rose to $305  
million, or $1.53 per share, from $258.7 million, or $1.30 per 
share, in the same period a year ago. Revenues rose 6 percent to 
$2.96 billion from $2.79 billion.

<HEADLINE> Buckeyes-Lions Set for Saturday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) -- The talk has become familiar prior to  
Saturday's Ohio State-Penn State matchup, the latest installment in 
what has become a rivalry to watch. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buckeyes are having a down year. The Nittany Lions' real  
tests don't come until November, with games against Michigan and 
Michigan State. No. 2 Penn State will easily cover the 11-point 
spread at home against the 18th-ranked Buckeyes. 
</P>
<P>
	Forget all that talk, coaches John Cooper and Joe Paterno said.  
Rankings go out the door when these two meet: Plenty is always at 
stake for both. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're still Ohio State,'' Lions linebacker Brandon Short  
said. ``It doesn't matter if they're 0-10. They're coming here to 
play Penn State. It's Penn State-Ohio State. Records don't 
matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three times in the past six years, one of them has been No. 1.  
From 1996-98, both were unbeaten and in the Top 10. Year after 
year, the Big Ten championship and a run at the national title are 
still possibilities for one or the other when they meet. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, Penn State has the most on the line: Though 6-0  
overall and 2-0 in the Big Ten, questions remain after its 
lackluster victory over Iowa on Saturday. Ohio State is the first 
of four ranked opponents who will decide in the next six weeks 
whether the Lions are contenders in the national title race. 
</P>
<P>
	For the Buckeyes (4-2, 1-1 Big Ten), who have staggered after  
losing virtually every star from last year's 11-1 team, an upset 
would rejuvenate a team that lost to Miami in the opener and 
collapsed against Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	Paterno, for one, isn't overlooking them, especially since the  
Buckeyes have beaten him more times (4) than any other team since 
the Lions joined the Big Ten in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very, very good Ohio State team,'' he said. ``Don't  
be misled by what happened to them in a couple of ball games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That may sound like typical Paterno, but he is apparently  
preparing for the Buckeyes with great caution. He abruptly barred 
players from talking to the media this week, perhaps to avoid 
bulletin-board material, perhaps to quiet the inevitable pregame 
hype. 
</P>
<P>
	LaVar Arrington already popped off in the preseason, telling  
Sports Illustrated that Na'il Diggs, Ohio State's leading tackler 
with 53, is ``all right, but he's not me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Penn State's John Blick shed some light on the blackout, saying  
the team was trying to avoid getting wound up about the Buckeyes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're going to keep it in perspective. I don't think  
we're going to get too overconfident or overemotional about the 
game,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper played mind games with his players, too.  
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Cooper taunted his players, saying he didn't think  
they could win unless they played perfect and Penn State made 
plenty of mistakes. That upset a few of them. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buckeyes have lost a starting quarterback, a running back,  
two receivers and three defensive stars from last year, but Paterno 
sees the same kind of team. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are younger, but they have the same kind of ability,'' he  
said. ``I don't see much difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Buckeyes are taking comfort in playing almost the same Lions  
team that lost 28-9 in Columbus last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know it's basically the same team as last year that we only  
get 179 yards of total offense,'' Diggs said. ``I think if we come 
out and study the film -- because there's not too much they do -- but 
come out and study film and tackle and do things like last year's 
team did, there's no way that team should win.''

	Pakistani Army Chief Takes Over  
</P>
<P>
	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Pakistan's army chief declared a  
state of emergency Friday and named himself chief executive, the 
state-run news agency announced. The announcement came just two 
days after Gen. Pervaiz Musharraf ousted the democratically elected 
government in a bloodless coup. Ousted Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, 
who has been under house arrest in the capital, reportedly had been 
moved to Lahore, where troops maintained a 24-hour guard on his

	Clinton Denounces Test Ban Vote  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite the Senate's defeat of a nuclear test  
ban treaty, President Clinton said today that the United States 
will refrain from testing, as it has done since 1992. The vote 
makes the United States the first nuclear power to specifically 
reject the 154-nation agreement on ending nuclear weapons testing. 
Clinton accused the Republican-led Senate of ``reckless 
partisanship'' in rejecting the international pact and appealed to 
nuclear-capable countries not to use the vote as an excuse to 
resume or begin testing. Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the Senate 
majority leader, said he doubted that Democrats could turn the 
Senate rejection into a winning campaign issue because ``this one 
is not a close call.'' 

</P>
<P>
	Nations Dismayed by Treaty Vote  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Russia accused the United States today of  
undermining world stability with the Senate defeat of a 
multinational nuclear test ban treaty. China, another nuclear 
giant, called the rejection deeply worrying. Around the globe, 
nations charged Washington with sending out a wrong and dangerous 
signal. India hinted it may take its time before signing on to the 
treaty. In Pakistan -- India's uneasy neighbor and fellow nuclear 
power -- the military leaders who seized control two days ago had 
nothing to say. But a spokesman for Pakistani opposition leader 
Benazir Bhutto said it is now virtually certain that neither 
Pakistan nor India will sign the treaty.

	HAVANA (AP) -- Cuban authorities evacuated tens of thousands of  
people this morning as Hurricane Irene dumped heavy rains across 
parts of the Caribbean island. The storm, expected to creep north 
toward Florida, was already battering Miami with rain and forcing 
tourists to leave the Keys. Although still a weak hurricane, Irene 
worried forecasters because it could gain strength after it crosses 
Cuba, especially if it spends a long time over water. The hurricane 
was expected to hit the Tampa area by Sunday. Tourists have been 
advised to leave the Florida Keys, and heavy rains were blamed for 
causing some traffic accidents in Miami today.

can to straighten out a complex and outdated system plagued by

	Blair Campaigns in Favor of EU

	LONDON (AP) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair kicked of a  
campaign today backing close cooperation with the Eurpoean Union. 
But critics cast the move as a disguised drive to persuade Britons 
to adopt the EU's common currency, the euro. Blair made only one 
reference in his speech to the euro, saying it would be ``madness'' 
to rule out adopting the EU's single currency, which officially 
went into use in 11 European countries on Jan 1. He plans to call a 
referendum on adopting the euro, probably in about 2001, if 
economic conditions look right.

agreed to a four-year deal. Terms of the contract were not 
available. The Tigers offered Parrish the opportunity to remain in 
the organization, the club said. It didn't say if Parrish accepted. 
Parrish said the last time he talked to a team official was a 
couple of days before the season ended.

	U.S. Foresaw Coup in Pakistan  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was the  
intended but unnamed target of recent warnings by the Clinton 
administration about constitutionally questionable moves in the 
South Asian country, officials say. Sharif had been cracking down 
on demonstrators and the media, so senior U.S. officials issued 
pointed and thinly veiled warnings that he should not overstep 
constitutional lines. While the administration also was signaling 
the military to stay in line, a look back on U.S. strategy toward 
Pakistan now that Army chief Gen. Pervaiz Musharraf has ousted 
Sharif in a coup suggests the Clinton administration inadvertently 
may have contributed to the prime minister's downfall.

	Decision in Ramsey Case No Surprise  
</P>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- The decision against filing charges in the  
JonBenet Ramsey slaying was another frustrating twist for residents 
and relatives who have waited nearly three years to learn her 
killer's identity. ``The case is tragic,'' said Kathy Minter, 49, a 
13-year Boulder resident. ``I think everyone messed up -- the 
police, the media, the tabloids, the Ramseys and the district 
attorney's office. It's very sad.'' Yesterday, a Boulder County 
grand jury investigating the case was dismissed and prosecutors 
said there was not enough evidence to warrant charges in the 
6-year-old's death.

	BLOOMFIELD, Ind. (AP) -- Three FBI agents and six militia  
members, face to face -- but there was no confrontation. Instead, 
both sides sat down and tried to discuss ways to foster better 
relationships between the two groups. It's part of a national 
attempt to curtail animosity that has resulted in sometimes violent 
battles between anti-government groups and law enforcement in 
recent years. ``I think what we need to do is realize that we're 
all human beings and we all want to do what's morally right, though 
we may have different ideas on how to do that,'' said Albert King, 
a member of the Greene County Militia.

	Democrats Will Make Treaty An Issue  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrats are pledging to make Senate  
rejection of a historic nuclear test ban treaty a political issue 
for 2000. Republican opponents of the pact call it fatally flawed 
and dispute that the vote will command much campaign attention. On 
a largely party line vote, the Senate defeated the Comprehensive 
Test Ban Treaty late last night, 51-48. Only four Senate 
Republicans voted for the treaty. The United States thus became the 
first nuclear power to specifically reject the 154-nation agreement 
on ending nuclear weapons testing.

	GOP Seeks To Restore Medicare Cuts  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With Congress dogged by lobbyists and  
advertising predicting disaster in the nation's hospitals and 
nursing homes, Republicans are proposing giving back as much as $15 
billion to health care providers whose Medicare fees were squeezed 
to help balance the federal budget. Separate plans offered by House 
and Senate committee chairmen this week would give nursing homes 
more money for patients with complex illnesses, loosen payment caps 
for rehabilitative therapy, and grant hospitals, HMOs and home 
health care companies a temporary reprieve from scheduled future 
fee cuts.

	Chinese Asked That Probe Be Dropped  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a lobbying effort that backfired, two top  
Chinese Embassy officials recently visited Capitol Hill to urge a 
House committee to drop its investigation of a conglomerate owned 
by the Chinese government. Instead, committee staffers said the 
meeting injected more vigor into a probe that had been a smaller 
offshoot of an investigation of illegal campaign contributions. 
``I've worked on Capitol Hill for 15 years, and I've never heard of 
a diplomat coming in and trying to squelch a congressional 
investigation,'' said Kevin Binger, Republican staff director of 
the House Government Reform Committee.

	History Repeats in Yanks' Win

	NEW YORK (AP) -- History does repeat itself: Bernie Williams once  
again won the opener of the AL Championship Series with an 
extra-inning home run, and the New York Yankees, trailing the 
Boston Red Sox, once again frustrated their rivals, snatching a win 
away with a little help from the umpires. ``If it took a break like 
that to get us going, it is welcomed,'' Williams said last night 
after his 10th-inning homer off Rod Beck gave New York a 4-3 win 
over Boston. Williams won the 1996 ALCS opener with an 11th-inning 
homer off Baltimore's Randy Myers.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Denounces Test Ban Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton accused Senate Republicans  
of recklessness and irresponsibility Thursday for defeating the 
nuclear test ban treaty and warned, ``You'll see a lot of testing'' 
by Russia, China, India and Pakistan if the United States abandons 
the landmark agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton pledged the United States would refrain from testing --  
as it has since 1992 -- despite the treaty's rejection. ``It still 
binds us'' unless the president says otherwise, Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	With Texas Gov. George W. Bush and other Republican presidential  
hopefuls opposed to the treaty, Clinton acknowledged that a future 
president might disavow the ban. ``Then all bets are off,'' Clinton 
said. ``You'll see a lot of testing and they'll bail'' on the 
nuclear nonproliferation treaty, another major arms accord. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's words reflected deep White House bitterness over  
the treaty vote and the undiminished animosity between Clinton and 
congressional Republicans after the impeachment battle and fights 
over gun control, tax cuts and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, at a news conference a day after the test ban treaty  
failed on a 51-48 Senate vote, said Republicans have fallen into 
``a new isolationism'' and had voted on the basis of partisan 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
	In blistering language, he also said Republicans were  
endangering America's economic prosperity by ``lurching from one 
unworkable idea to the next'' in spending proposals and budget 
cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans quickly answered Clinton's charges. ``It was not  
about politics,'' Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said 
of the treaty vote. ``It was about the substance of the treaty and 
that's all it was. No senator, no senator, was pressured to vote 
anyway but his or her conscience based on the substance of the 
treaty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, in his first full-fledged news conference since July  
21, also made these points: 
</P>
<P>
	--He expects Vice President Al Gore to win the Democratic  
presidential nomination over former senator and basketball star 
Bill Bradley. But Clinton said he would support whoever is the 
Democratic nominee. 
</P>
<P>
	--The United States hopes for a return to civilian government in  
Pakistan after Tuesday's military coup. He said ``we don't like 
it'' when military leaders forcibly remove elected governments. 
Clinton said he hoped ``nothing would be done'' to aggravate 
tensions between Pakistan and India. 
</P>
<P>
	As Clinton denounced the Senate's treaty vote, other Democrats  
pledged to make it a political issue for 2000. Gore, in his first 
television ad of the 2000 presidential race, said he would send the 
treaty back to the Senate for ratification if he wins. 
</P>
<P>
	Striding into the East Room, Clinton took a combative tone in  
his opening remark. ``In recent days, members of the congressional 
majority have displayed a reckless partisanship. It threatens 
America's economic well-being and now our national security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Yesterday, hard-line Republicans irresponsibly forced a vote  
against the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty,'' Clinton said. 
``This was partisan politics of the worst kind, because it was so 
blatant and because of the risks it poses to the safety of the 
American people and the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Urging all nations to refrain from nuclear testing, he said, ``I  
have no doubt'' that the Senate will ratify the treaty eventually -- 
although that is highly unlikely in the near term since Republicans 
will remain in control at least until January 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The president defended himself against criticism that he had  
waged a weak, 11th hour campaign for the treaty. He said he had 
spoken at least 30 times about it but ``we had no earthly idea'' 
that it was going to be brought up hurriedly for a Senate vote. 
``There was simply no time to put it together,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will not -- we will not -- abandon the commitments inherent  
in the treaty and resume testing ourselves,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, if we ever get a president that's against the test ban  
treaty, which we may get ... you'll have Russia testing, you'll 
have China testing, you'll have India testing, you'll have Pakistan 
testing,'' Clinton said. ``And we will be in a much, much more 
dangerous world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More generally, Clinton complained that the treaty's defeat was  
another step in the United States' retreat from a global leadership 
role. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are in a battle with the new isolationists and the  
Republican Party,'' Clinton said. He said the United States has 
failed to pay its U.N. dues or meet financial obligations under 
Middle East peace agreements and an accord with Russia to help 
dismantle the former Soviet nuclear arsenal.

<HEADLINE> Court Nixes Video Gambling in S.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- The state Supreme Court ruled today that  
South Carolina's video gambling industry was outlawed when the 
state Legislature approved a referendum on its future, though the 
court struck down the referendum itself. 
</P>
<P>
	The court ruled that the public vote, set for Nov. 2, was  
unconstitutional. But the part of the law that said the games would 
be banned as of July 1 stands, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The General Assembly unconstitutionally delegated its power to  
enact the general law of this state,'' said the unanimous opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of the $2.8 billion-a-year video gambling industry  
cheered the ruling, and even supporters said it seemed unlikely 
that lawmakers would return to a controversial issue that has 
dogged the state since the games became legal through a 
little-noticed budget amendment in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you really think that the legislature really wants to go  
back and visit such a contentious issue in an election year?'' said 
Rep. Tim Wilkes, a video gambling supporter and Winnsboro Democrat. 
``I don't know what the pro-poker people are going to do in the 
face of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Video gambling operators, however, said they would seek to  
convince lawmakers to reopen debate in January, correct the 
problems in the law and have the issue before voters in a 
nonbinding referendum by March or April, said Michael Gunn, a 
lawyer and lobbyist for video gambling casino operators.

<HEADLINE> `Moonlighting' Creator Is Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- You might say ``Now and Again'' is a show with a  
brain. That would be Michael Wiseman's, which was recently involved 
in a little body-switching. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's also about toes. Yours. On which this curious new  
series keeps you. 
</P>
<P>
	For example: What to make of the eerie three-minute sequence  
with a Tokyo subway car, a carton of eggs and mass execution that 
began the first episode last month? 
</P>
<P>
	And what about Dr. Morris as he beholds Michael Wiseman, a  
top-secret superman engineered to carry out risky government 
missions? Thrilled at his masterpiece, the otherwise starchy 
scientist begins crooning: ``... On the day that you were born the 
angels got together, and decided to create a dream come true ....'' 
A Carpenters song is not what you were expecting. 
</P>
<P>
	Exactly what is ``Now and Again'' about? Well, at the start of  
last week's episode, it took 3 1/2 minutes to brief viewers on the two 
installments that had gone before: 
</P>
<P>
	Wiseman, a middle-aged family man and insurance agent (portrayed  
in his original, roly-poly form by guest-star John Goodman) dies 
unexpectedly, whereupon his brain is given a new home in a young, 
trim, superhuman body (which, from head to toe, looks very much 
like that of series star Eric Close). 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange for life after death, Wiseman agrees to do the  
government's bidding under the day-and-night control of Dr. Morris 
(Dennis Haysbert). And there's one other condition: He can never 
contact his family. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Wiseman's bereft widow (Margaret Colin) is battling  
his former boss, a scoundrel who is withholding her insurance 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Got it? Nevermind. Only two things seem certain about ``Now and  
Again'': 
</P>
<P>
	-- No insurance company will be buying ad time on this show.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Otherwise, anything can happen.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's about death and resurrection, about family and  
commitment, about the power of love,'' says creator Glenn Gordon 
Caron, ``with all of that framed by what we traditionally think of 
as an action-adventure show.'' And don't forget the sci-fi element, 
or the comedy. 
</P>
<P>
	Airing Friday at 9 p.m. EDT on CBS, ``Now and Again'' is this  
fall's freshest, most freewheeling series. And the most 
acquisitive. Borrowing from ``RoboCop,'' ``Frankenstein'' and ``The 
Wild, Wild West,'' from the Broadway musicals ``Damn Yankees'' and 
``Carousel,'' from David Lynch depravity and Frank Capra 
righteousness -- well, this is some genre-busting goulash. 
</P>
<P>
	``Part of our job is to startle you,'' Caron explains. ``If it's  
different enough, maybe you'll come back every week just because 
you're intrigued.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, so good. ``Now and Again'' is winning healthy ratings,  
and last Friday trounced the much-awaited premiere of its Fox 
time-slot rival, ``Harsh Realm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Caron has another goal: to keep himself intrigued.  
</P>
<P>
	It was he, of course, who created a landmark genre-straddler of  
the 1980s: ``Moonlighting.'' Ostensibly a melodrama about a 
detective agency, it never let a case get in the way of romance, 
slapstick or a painful pun. (A bucket falls on Miss Dipesto's head 
and David cracks, ``You're looking a little pail.'') 
</P>
<P>
	``There was this huge body of detective television `literature'  
out there already, and I wasn't excited about doing another one,'' 
Caron recalls. ```Moonlighting' was my attempt to stay awake, to 
stay involved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Moonlighting,'' which starred Cybill Shepherd and a brash  
newcomer named Bruce Willis, kept everyone awake for four antic 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, after a decade directing films (including ``Picture  
Perfect,'' ``Love Affair'' and ``Clean and Sober''), Caron is back 
in TV. This time, he has come upon the doddering corpus of TV 
action-adventure, then transplanted its brain and heart into his 
robust new series. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just trying to tell a story differently,'' he says.  
``Normally, if you did a show about a man who was built by the 
government, the focus would be on his missions and the villains he 
was supposed to thwart. But we have a tremendous emphasis on his 
personal life -- his inner life. Our object was to do a show that 
was very felt. 
</P>
<P>
	Caron, 45, is at his desk in the series' production offices, an  
austere suite whose only ornamentation is its candy-colored 
scattering of iMac computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Next door in this Queens industrial district, a sound stage  
accommodates the sets for Wiseman's townhouse-prison and the 
suburban home he used to share with his wife and daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	But the rest of New York City is Caron's back lot, which he taps  
to full advantage in giving his series its unique style. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm trying for a collision of the weird and unexpected with  
almost the mundane,'' Caron says. ``I want to see how broad the 
palette can be: How much comedy, how much drama, how much tragedy, 
how much action, and how much music can you pack into the same bag 
and still make it seem of a piece?'' 
</P>
<P>
	And why not? ``Your own life,'' he observes, ``doesn't declare a  
single genre as you're living it.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in television ...  
</P>
<P>
	`RYAN CAULFIELD': He could have gone to college, but he chose  
another course. Our 19-year-old hero, who still lives at home with 
his widowed mom, is going to be a cop. As Ryan explains to the 
viewer on his first day on the force, ``They say I'm crazy for 
doing this, that I'm too young, that I don't know what I'm getting 
into.'' Well, they're part right: He doesn't have a clue. And 
that's what ``Ryan Caulfield: The First Year'' is about: learning 
about life on the mean streets of Philadelphia, and growing up 
fast. It's also about maintaining his connection with the 
fancy-free world in which his school friends (and his girlfriend) 
remain. ``On one of those good days,'' he reflects, ``I can set 
things right in both worlds.'' But for one young man, it's clearly 
a stretch. It may be even more of a stretch for the show. ``Ryan'' 
premieres Friday at 8 p.m. EDT on Fox.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Universal Candle of China is recalling about  
21,000 Halloween tea lights as a possible fire hazard. The candles 
can burn with a high flame, posing a fire and burn hazard to 
customers, the Consumer Product Safety Commission said on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bath &AMP; Body Works, which has sold tea lights throughout  
September for about $1, has received one report of a high flame. 
</P>
<P>
	No injuries have been reported.  
</P>
<P>
	The recalled candle has an orange pumpkin face with yellow eyes,  
nose and mouth, and a green stem. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission recommends customers to stop using tea lights  
immediately and return them to any Bath &AMP; Body Works shop for a 
refund and a $10 gift certificate. For more information, call

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Mixed; Dow Up 54.45 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks bounced to a mixed finish today as strong  
corporate earnings and soaring bond yields prevented the market 
from charting any clear course. 
</P>
<P>
	At the close of a volatile session on Wall Street, the Dow Jones  
industrial average was up 54.45 at 10,286.61. The Dow was lower for 
much of the morning, but also rose as much as 110 points above 
Wednesday's close before giving up ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators ended mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index was down slightly, while the Nasdaq composite index managed a 
slight gain. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks initially fell today after the Commerce Department issued  
what appeared to be a report of moderate September retail sales. 
Total retail sales rose to a seasonally adjusted $253.4 billion, a 
gain of just 0.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But excluding the volatile automobile category, retail sales  
rose a brisk 0.6 percent in September. Many analysts were expecting 
a 0.5 percent gain. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, the Labor Department said the number of  
Americans filing for unemployment benefits last week fell by an 
unexpected 29,000 to 285,000. Economists believe jobless claims 
levels under 300,000 are an indication of an extremely tight labor 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	Both reports heightened fears that the Federal Reserve will  
raise interest rates for the third time this year in an effort to 
keep inflation from escalating. The Fed's Open Market Committee 
will hold its next meeting on Nov. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Fears of inflation sent the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond  
soaring to 6.32 percent, its highest level since Oct. 1997. Bond 
yields above 6.25 percent are viewed as a very appealing 
alternative to stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bonds are putting tremendous pressure on the market,'' said  
Charles Pradilla, chief investment strategist at SG Cowen 
Securities. ``If bonds weren't acting so badly, we could have had a 
powerful rally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, many analysts had anticipated that a handful of robust  
earnings reports could lift stocks from a two-day slump that 
knocked 415 points off the Dow. Instead, the good news provided 
pockets of strength in an overall weak market. 
</P>
<P>
	After releasing earnings that beat analysts' expectations, Apple  
soared, helping to contain the losses of the technology-dominated 
Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing provided much of the Dow's advance. Boeing's stock rose  
after the company said third-quarter profits rose 37 percent as its 
commercial aircraft division continued to recover from costly 
production problems. Boeing earned 52 cents per share in the 
quarter, beating analysts' estimates by 3 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	But General Motors slipped after reporting earnings of $1.33 a  
share, compared with analysts' predictions of $1.24 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	And investors continued their pattern of punishing companies for  
any measure of bad news. 
</P>
<P>
	Unisys plunged after announcing that earnings increased 72  
percent from the third quarter of 1998. The market focused on the 
fact that Boeing's revenues grew just 4 percent, below the 8 
percent anticipated by analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	Gail Dudack, chief equity strategist at Warburg Dillon Read,  
said scattered reports of earnings weakness have pushed investors 
back into the pessimism that drove stocks lower in late September 
and early October, preventing the market from building on last 
week's solid gains. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought the oversold rebound would continue this week as  
earnings season begins,'' she said. ``Instead, inflation fears and 
disappointing earnings results put the market into a tailspin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Traders suggested that the market's volatility was sparked by  
the promise of a ``double witching'' day on Friday. Quarterly stock 
and index options expire, forcing traders to adjust their 
portfolios.

<HEADLINE> Kmart Plans 400 New Stores </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Kmart Corp. plans to open 400 new stores over the  
next five years, including 70 stores next year, as the discount 
retailer moves to expand into larger, metropolitan markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Troy, Mich.-based company also announced Thursday that it  
would renovate 166 smaller stores. 
</P>
<P>
	About half of the new stores will be Super Kmarts, which are  
bigger stores that carry groceries along with wide array of general 
merchandise goods, such as clothes and home furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
	News of the expansion comes as Kmart wraps up a multi-year  
program to convert 1,840 stores to Big Kmart stores at a cost of 
$1.1 billion. The Big Kmart stores include general merchandise 
products as well as small food department. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, with a store base that has undergone a massive facelift  
in the past three years, customers are coming back to Kmart,'' 
chief executive Floyd Hall said at an investor conference in White 
Plains, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kmart still struggles to keep pace with rival Wal-Mart  
Stores Inc., which continues to dominate the discount store market 
with their aggressive pricing strategy and advanced distribution 
and delivery system. 
</P>
<P>
	Just last week, Wal-Mart announced it will open, remodel or  
relocate as many as 340 stores next year, as well as greatly expand 
the number of distribution centers it operates. 
</P>
<P>
	With Kmart's new expansion plans, the company hopes to expand  
its presence in urban markets and metropolitan areas, where 
Wal-Mart doesn't have as large a presence. 
</P>
<P>
	Kmart announced in July that it hired Supervalu Inc. and Fleming  
Companies Inc. -- the two largest U.S. grocery distributors -- to 
stock $3.9 billion of goods a year on its stores' shelves. The 
agreement enables Kmart to avoid building an expensive food 
delivery system of its own -- similar to the one Wal-Mart already 
has in place. 
</P>
<P>
	Kmart operates 2,153 stores in the United States, Puerto Rico,  
Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

<HEADLINE> Daewoo, GM Step Up Alliance Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- General Motors Corp. and South Korea's  
ailing Daewoo group said today they were accelerating talks on 
forming a strategic alliance in auto manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
	A 30-member GM delegation, led by executive vice president Lou  
Hughes, arrived in Seoul early this week for a five-day visit to 
discuss details. The visit comes amid reports that GM is interested 
in taking over Daewoo's automobile unit. 
</P>
<P>
	GM and Daewoo signed a memorandum of understanding in August to  
form a strategic alliance. Cash-strapped Daewoo hoped that the 
alliance would lead to fresh capital investment from the American 
automaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials of the two sides declined to discuss any details of  
the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Daewoo narrowly escaped becoming South Korea's largest  
bankruptcy when creditors agreed in June to delay repayment of $8.3 
billion in short-term debt for six months and extend $3.3 billion 
in new loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Two months later, Daewoo bowed to pressure from its creditors  
and agreed to sell all but six automobile-related units by the end 
of this year to repay $48 billion in debts. It has $65 billion in 
total assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Daewoo has since openly expressed willingness to sell its  
automobile unit to GM. 
</P>
<P>
	Daewoo Motor, South Korea's second largest automaker, produced  
900,000 vehicles last year. At the end of last year, it had $13.3 
billion in total assets and $9.8 billion in debts.

<HEADLINE> Fossils of Flying Dinosaur Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A fierce turkey-sized animal with sharp claws  
and teeth may have been the first flying feathered dinosaur, a 
missing link between the lumbering lizards of millions of years ago 
and the graceful birds of today. 
</P>
<P>
	Fossils of the animal, called Archaeoraptor liaoningensis,  
suggest that it lived 120 million to 140 million years ago when a 
branch of dinosaurs was evolving into the vast family of birds that 
now live on every continent, researchers said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking at the first dinosaur that was capable of  
flying,'' said Philip Currie of the Royal Tyrrell Museum in 
Alberta, Canada, a dinosaur expert who helped analyze the new 
fossil. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know how good a flier it was, but it certainly has  
all of the structures you would expect to see in a flying animal,'' 
he said. The animal's shoulder girdle and breast bone resemble that 
of modern birds, said Currie, and its hands had been modified to 
form part of the wing structure. It also had a full set of feathers 
and a long tail that probably gave it stability in flight. 
</P>
<P>
	``The long stiff tail suggests that it helped maneuver in  
flight, but it also suggests that the animal wouldn't have been a 
very good flier,'' Currie said. 
</P>
<P>
	Archaeoraptor also had hollow bones, typical of birds. Such  
bones are strong, but light enough to help the birds the fly. 
</P>
<P>
	``This animal was about the size of a small turkey,'' Currie  
said. ``That is relatively big for a bird, but small for a 
dinosaur.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fossils, to be unveiled for the first time on Friday at the  
National Geographic Society's Explorers Hall in Washington, are 
among a group of feathered dinosaur remains unearthed recently in 
the Liaoning Province of China. 
</P>
<P>
	Another animal, called Sinornithosaurus millenii, or ``Chinese  
bird-reptile of the millennium'', had birdlike features and short 
downy feathers. It also was about the size of a turkey, but 
probably was not capable of flight. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sinornithosaurus, however, ``had this terrible claw on its  
hind legs and much longer claws on its hands,'' said Currie. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would have been quite fearsome for its size,'' he said.  
``You can imagine being attacked by a turkey with claws.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fossils of another feathered dinosaur, called Beipiaosaurus  
inexpectus, also are being made public by the National Geographic. 
This animal was larger than the others, about 7 feet long, and 
apparently had stiff, narrow feathers that provided warmth. It is 
not thought to have been capable of flight. 
</P>
<P>
	The three animals are all theropod dinosaurs, a group that  
included the ultimate meat-eater, the Tyrannosaurus rex. Theropods 
all walked upright on their hind legs, had long tails and were 
thought to be fast and deadly. 
</P>
<P>
	The new findings also suggest that many theropods, including  
Tyrannosaurus, may have had feathers at some point of their 
development. The National Geographic-sponsored researchers suggest 
that Tyrannosaurus infants may have hatched with a coat of down 
that was shed as they got older.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton Targets Health Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOLTON LANDING, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton called  
Thursday for restoring trust to the nation's medical system, making 
it clear health care reform will be a focus of her campaign for a 
U.S. Senate seat from New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking before the Healthcare Association of New York State, a  
trade group representing hospitals and nursing homes, Mrs. Clinton 
said many Americans remember the era of television's Dr. Marcus 
Welby. 
</P>
<P>
	``When people fondly talk about some golden age of the past ...  
they want once again to be able to trust the system,'' she told an 
audience of about 400 people at the posh Sagamore Resort on the 
shores of Lake George. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton, who directed President Clinton's failed attempt to  
overhaul the nation's health care system, said she wasn't just 
talking about patients but also about hospital administrators, 
doctors, and nurses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many doctors today feel their professional discretion and  
autonomy are being taken away,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The address marked one of the first policy speeches of Mrs.  
Clinton's fledgling campaign and made it clear she planned to again 
tackle the issue she failed to push through Congress in 1994. She 
conceded Thursday that her plan then had been too ambitious. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked for his reaction to Mrs. Clinton's remarks, Healthcare  
Association president Daniel Sisto, said, ``She clearly offered the 
right prescription.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady was continuing the health care theme in remarks  
later Thursday to the New York State Nurses Association in Lake 
Placid. 
</P>
<P>
	In her remarks in Bolton Landing, Mrs. Clinton attacked the  
balanced budget act of 1997, approved by Congress and her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	``These cuts went too far ... they have caused too much pain and  
are cutting into too much muscle and bone,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton is campaigning for the Senate seat being vacated by  
fellow Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan. It is a race that is 
expected to pit her against Republican New York City Mayor Rudolph 
Giuliani. 
</P>
<P>
	The trip was Mrs. Clinton's first to the Adirondack Mountains as  
a candidate. Earlier this year the first lady's camp came under 
fire after an unidentified advisor told the New York Daily News 
that the Clintons would never vacation in the ``fly infested'' 
Adirondacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton got to see the mountains in their fall splendor.  
The Adirondack foliage was at near peak color with red, orange, and 
yellow leaves wet from an overnight rain.

<HEADLINE> Governor's Woes Not Election Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- With Gov. Kirk Fordice's extramarital  
affair the talk of Mississippi, the two men vying to succeed him 
are keeping their distance from him and portraying themselves as 
devoted fathers and husbands. 
</P>
<P>
	The families of Democrat Ronnie Musgrove and Republican Mike  
Parker have figured prominently in their campaign commercials. And 
the two self-described conservatives have talked about better 
schools and tax relief for families. 
</P>
<P>
	Fordice, a conservative Republican who is barred from seeking a  
third four-year term, has been supporting Parker. But quietly. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor gave up a public role in Dan Quayle's presidential  
campaign this summer after his affair with a widow became public. 
Fordice and his wife are getting divorced but still live in the 
Governor's Mansion. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's almost disappeared from the face of the earth, and that's  
probably the best thing that's happened to the Mike Parker 
campaign,'' said University of Southern Mississippi political 
scientist Joseph Parker, no relation to the candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Polls show Musgrove and Parker in a dead heat with just over two  
weeks to go before the election, the most closely watched of the 
three governor's races around the country this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Parker, a former congressman, has spent most of his money on  
feel-good commercials showing him hunting and fishing with his 
children and talking to his mother about dirty campaign tactics. 
</P>
<P>
	An ad Parker began running this week tracks his courtship with  
his wife, Rosemary, beginning with black-and-white photos of the 
two, who were chosen most beautiful and most handsome in high 
school. As soft music plays, they are shown embracing by a barn. In 
the ad, Parker says they have been married 29 years and ``she's 
smarter than I am and I'm smart enough to know that. I think she'd 
make a great first lady.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Musgrove, lieutenant governor for the past four years, has also  
put his family on the air. One commercial shows his son in a 
classroom, raising his hand to ask a question. His daughter and 
wife are also in the ad. 
</P>
<P>
	Musgrove has also aggressively challenged Parker's voting record  
in Congress and the $26,000 in checks he bounced during the House 
banking scandal in the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Musgrove, 43, and Parker, 49, are expected to spend about $3  
million each in the first Mississippi governor's race since 1987 
without an incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
	In neighboring Louisiana, Republican Gov. Mike Foster is  
considered a lock this year. And Democrat Gov. Paul Patton is 
expected to win re-election easily in Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	Mississippi's race is being watched closely as Republicans try  
to recover from losing governor's offices in Alabama and South 
Carolina last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Parker switched to the GOP from the Democratic Party in 1995.  
Democrats are hoping the party switch backfires. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week Fordice attended a Parker fund-raiser headlined by  
Texas Gov. George W. Bush. Fordice's seat was in the back row next 
to the cordoned-off section for reporters. Fordice has given Parker 
no money, but Parker has received contributions from several 
Fordice family members. 
</P>
<P>
	Parker, a father of three, talks in general terms about more  
accountability in schools and making government user-friendly. 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, Musgrove, a father of two whose wife is a school  
teacher, has made education and economic development his chief 
campaign topics. 
</P>
<P>
	Author John Grisham, a good friend of Musgrove's, has helped in  
the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``After eight years of Kirk Fordice, we ought to be really  
thankful that we're going to get somebody who's a decent person,'' 
Grisham said. ``Right now Jesse Ventura would look good or Hulk 
Hogan or anybody would look good.''

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Skeptical Over IOC Vows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- International Olympic Committee officials  
promised skeptical lawmakers Thursday that they're making 
fundamental reforms in the process of selecting host cities 
following widespread abuses by both IOC members and bid committees 
in Atlanta and Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a crisis,'' Francois Carrard, the IOC's director  
general, told the House commerce subcommittee on oversight and 
investigations. ``Yes there have been abuses. Yes there have been 
excesses. But we are fully committed to deliver before the end of 
the year a fully, newly renovated IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carrard and two Americans on the IOC, Anita DeFrantz and Jim  
Easton, outlined reforms the committee already has instituted, 
including the creation of an independent ethics commission to 
police relations between IOC members and the cities competing for 
their votes. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Carrard said the IOC will vote in December on a  
series of ``absolutely radical'' reforms that include banning 
member visits to bid cities, term limits and age limits for 
committee members and expanded representation on the IOC by Olympic 
athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	But members of the House panel, which has been investigating  
gifts and travel benefits bestowed on IOC members during Atlanta's 
winning bid for the 1996 Summer Games, seemed less than convinced 
that the IOC really means business. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ron Klink of Pennsylvania, the senior Democrat on the  
panel, said he's ``skeptical that the IOC is serious this time'' 
about changing the bidding culture in which cities seeking to host 
the games and IOC officials both have routinely ignored gift limit 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee Republican Ed Bryant is ``dubious at this point that  
we'll see the kind of change we need to see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrat Henry Waxman of California says the IOC has been  
``remarkably slow'' in enacting reforms recommended last spring by 
a commission headed by former Sen. George Mitchell. If the IOC 
fails to embrace meaningful change, Waxman predicted there will be 
``a strong bipartisan push in Congress for punitive sanctions 
against the IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Barton, a Texas Republican, called for the removal of IOC  
president Juan Antonio Samaranch ``sooner rather than later.'' He 
said Samaranch has ``created a cesspool at the international 
level'' and should not be permitted to oversee the reform effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Panel chairman Fred Upton, a Republican from Michigan, said  
Samaranch has agreed to appear Dec. 15 to testify about reforms the 
IOC is planning to implement in early December. The IOC created a 
special commission to recommend changes after the Salt Lake City 
scandal resulted in two federal indictments and the resignations or 
forced expulsions of 10 IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young, a key force behind Atlanta's  
winning bid, gave Samaranch an unsolicited endorsement during 
questioning by the panel. Young said Samaranch has been responsible 
for transforming the IOC from a ``white male ole boy's club'' into 
a diverse organization that's far more representative of the 
nations of the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Young and Billy Payne, the former chairman of the Atlanta  
Committee for the Olympic Games, acknowledged that Atlanta violated 
IOC gift rules in lobbying for the 1996 games. But they denied that 
the gifts and favors showered on IOC members were designed to buy 
their votes or corrupt the process that led to Atlanta's selection. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew the rules; we knew everybody else was breaking them,''  
said Young. ``We weren't going to violate our consciences but we 
were going to win.''

<HEADLINE> Allied Signal Earnings Up 17 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MORRIS TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) -- AlliedSignal Inc. reported a 17  
percent increase in third-quarter earnings on growth in its 
aerospace and turbocharger businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The industrial products company, which plans to merge with  
Honeywell Inc., had earnings of $386 million, or 69 cents per 
share, compared with $329 million, or 59 cents a share, for the 
same period in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The results include an after-tax gain of $59 million from the  
sale of its laminate systems business and charges totaling $54 
million for restructuring and other costs. When those one-time 
items are excluded, AlliedSignal's earnings came to 68 cents per 
share, matching estimates of analysts surveyed by First 
Call/Thomson Financial 
</P>
<P>
	Sales rose 3 percent to $3.84 billion from $3.74 billion. The  
gain is 6 percent if divestitures and a government contract 
restructuring are excluded. 
</P>
<P>
	AlliedSignal attributed its earnings growth to gains in its  
aerospace and turbocharger products businesses and a rebound in its 
restructured transportation products businesses. However, it 
reported that these gains were partly offset by difficulties in its 
materials businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Operating earnings in the aerospace systems business rose 12  
percent, while operating earnings in the specialty chemicals 
segnment fell nearly 28 percent due to what the company called an 
underutilized facility and new product expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
	In the turbine technology segment, operating income rose 68  
percent on strong sales growth in automotive turbochargers and 
military helicopter engines. 
</P>
<P>
	Operating income fell by more than half in the performance  
polymer business due to a drop in nylon sales. Transportation 
products income, including earnings from sales of Prestone 
products, was up 71 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The company and Honeywell each won shareholder approval during  
the quarter for their planned merger. They also agreed to divest 
some of their aviation electronics businesses to win clearance from 
the U.S. Department of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
	They are now trying to get approval from the European  
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months, AlliedSignal earned $1.12 billion, or  
$1.98 a share, up from $979 million, or $1.70 a share, in the same 
period of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales came to $11.25 billion, just under $11.26 billion a year  
earlier.

<HEADLINE> Study: Brain Regenerates Cells </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Contradicting a long-held belief, researchers  
say the brain is constantly churning out new neurons for its 
learning and memory center, according to a study that could lead to 
novel ways to treat brains damaged by injury or diseases such as 
Alzheimer's. 
</P>
<P>
	In studies using macaque monkeys, the researchers at Princeton  
University have for the first time traced the path followed by 
neurons that are created in one part of the brain and then migrate 
to the neocortex, the center of the mind's ability to reason and 
think. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the new neurons arrive in the neocortex, they ``plug in''  
and become a new part of the brain's central circuitry, said 
Elizabeth Gould, head of a Princeton brain research team. 
</P>
<P>
	``This shows that there is a naturally regenerative mechanism''  
in the mature brain, said Gould, the first author of a study 
appearing Friday in the journal Science. ``If we can understand 
better how it works, maybe we could use that to direct the 
regeneration and repopulation of neurons in damaged areas of the 
brain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For decades, brain researchers have thought that once neurons  
were lost in the neocortex, they were not replaced and that their 
function forever was gone. It was believed the brain contains so 
many cells that this natural attrition had little effect until late 
in life. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the new Princeton study, if confirmed by other researchers,  
shows that the mature primate brain does produce new neurons that 
incorporate themselves into the thinking center. 
</P>
<P>
	``This study could be very significant in terms of understanding  
the range of mechanisms that the cortex has available to it for the 
storage of information and for repair,'' said William T. Greenough, 
director of neuroscience at the University of Illinois' Beckman 
Institute. ``These data scream for a reanalysis of human brain 
development.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier studies had given strong hints that the brain had an  
unsuspected regenerative power. Some researchers had shown in rats 
and monkeys that new cells were regenerated in the hippocampus, a 
very primitive part of the brain that controls basic functions and 
is the same in many animals. But it generally was believed that the 
neocortex, with its storehouse of memories and advanced reasoning 
power, was unique, stable and unchanging. 
</P>
<P>
	The neocortex reaches its most sophisticated level of  
development in primates, including humans. Most experts believe the 
structure and function of the neocortex is very similar in all 
primates and that basic processes in the brains of monkeys are like 
those in humans. But Greenough and others cautioned that Gould's 
study needs to be confirmed in humans. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Princeton study, Gould and her team injected monkeys with  
a compound called bromodeoxyuridine, or BRDU, that is taken up by 
cells in the process of making new cells. 
</P>
<P>
	An examination just hours after the injection showed that the  
cells in one area of the brain took up the BRDU, proving that the 
cells were dividing and making immature neurons. 
</P>
<P>
	An examination a week after injection showed that the new  
neurons had migrated, matured, and, in effect, had plugged 
themselves into the neocortex, the thinking center of the brain. 
</P>
<P>
	Just how these new neurons function is not known, Gould said.  
They could take up existing memories from the old neurons in the 
neocortex, or they could be like a new floppy disk in a computer -- 
clean and ready to start storing new data. Gould said more research 
is needed to understand exactly how the brain uses these new cells. 
</P>
<P>
	Gould said it is not known if Alzheimer's or other dementia  
disorders are linked to a failure or a decline of this natural 
neuron regeneration process. But at least now, she said, ``it is 
possible to consider that, to ask that question. It had not even 
been considered previously.''

<HEADLINE> Fawcett Appears on Letterman Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Farrah Fawcett was on her best behavior on David  
Letterman's show more than two years after a spacey appearance left 
fans wondering. 
</P>
<P>
	``Remember me?'' Letterman asked as he sat down to interview the  
actress Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Fawcett, whose inattentiveness and faltering speech made a  
lasting impression on her host, told him she was just a little 
nervous last time, partly because he was looking at nude pictures 
of her from Playboy magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Letterman told Ms. Fawcett that people had asked him if she was  
under the influence of drugs or alcohol. ``I just felt like I was 
driving somebody home,'' Letterman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last thing I would do with you -- please, believe me -- is  
be in an altered state,'' she insisted. 
</P>
<P>
	``What do I have to do to get you to reconsider that?''  
Letterman asked. 
</P>

	``Turn off those cameras,'' Ms. Fawcett shot back with a smile.

<HEADLINE> New York Times' Earnings Up 9 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Times Co. earned $60 million in the  
third quarter, up 9 percent from a year ago, on stronger 
advertising revenues at its newspapers and lower newsprint costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings reported Thursday were in line with Wall Street  
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	The company earned $55 million in the same three-month period a  
year ago. Per-share earnings rose to 34 cents this year from 29 
cents last year. Revenues rose 7 percent to $729.7 million from 
$682.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The results included a $3.5 million, or 2 cents per share,  
charge for severance costs at The Boston Globe. 
</P>
<P>
	New York Times chairman Arthur Sulzberger Jr. attributed the  
profit increase to robust growth in ad revenues from the company's 
newspapers, in particular the Globe, and to lower costs for 
newsprint. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues from newspapers rose 8 percent overall, with the  
strongest performance coming at the company's flagship New York 
Times, where ad revenues grew nearly 11 percent, and at the Globe, 
where ad revenues rose nearly 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's average cost of newsprint declined 19 percent  
while its consumption of the raw material was unchanged from the 
same period last year. But overall costs rose 5 percent due to 
higher payroll spending, expenses for a national expansion of The 
New York Times and promotional spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues from the company's Internet operations, which include  
Web sites for the company's main newspaper and city guide sites for 
New York and Boston, jumped 75 percent to $7.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to The New York Times and The Boston Globe, the  
company publishes 21 regional newspapers and three magazines. It 
also operates eight television stations and two New York City radio 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues in the magazine group increased 2.5 percent to $26.8  
million, while revenues in the broadcast group rose 1.1 percent in 
the quarter to $35.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of the year, earnings rose to $204.9  
million, or $1.14 per share, from $194.6 million, or $1 per share, 
in the same period a year ago. Revenues rose 4 percent to $2.25 
billion from $2.15 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also announced Thursday it was buying the Worcester  
Telegram &AMP; Gazette in Worcester, Mass., from The Chronicle 
Publishing Co. for about $295 million. The paper has a daily 
circulation of 107,000 and Sunday circulation of 134,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of the New York Times fell 56 1/4 cents to $40.43 3/4 in  
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> No Charges in JonBenet Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- It is an ending few seem happy with.  
</P>
<P>
	The JonBenet Ramsey grand jury was dismissed after 13 months of  
work Wednesday and prosecutors said there isn't enough evidence to 
charge anyone in the 6-year-old's strangulation nearly three years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl's family responded by asking that the investigation go  
on until the killer is caught. Gov. Bill Owens said he may appoint 
a special prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
	But the puzzling case that drew worldwide attention as much for  
its fingerpointing and charges of bungling as for JonBenet's death 
may be over. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know where to go from here,'' said Mimi Wesson, a law  
professor at the University of Colorado. ``Barring some very 
important and convincing new evidence, it is unlikely anyone will 
be charged with this crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boulder District Attorney Alex Hunter, who has said that John  
and Patsy Ramsey were under suspicion in their daughter's death, 
announced Wednesday that prosecutors ``do not have sufficient 
evidence to warrant the filing of charges against anyone who has 
been investigated with this crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He reminded the grand jurors that state law forbids them from  
discussing their work. Owens, meanwhile, promised to review the 
case and decide whether to appoint a special prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
	``While I am not presently in a position to comment on the work  
of this grand jury, I do know one fact: a little girl was brutally 
murdered in Boulder, Colorado, and the killer or killers remain 
free today,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Adams County District Attorney Bob Grant, one of four metro-area  
prosecutors who advised Hunter, told the NBC ``Today'' show today 
that the governor could appoint the state attorney general's office 
to the case. But, he said, experienced prosecutors have reviewed 
all of the evidence ``and have concluded that at this stage ... 
there is insufficient evidence to have a reasonable liklihood of 
conviction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The death in this university town northwest of Denver led to a  
case of extraordinary interest. It created friction between police 
and prosecutors, led to accusations that the district attorney's 
office was too timid and invited scrutiny of the child beauty 
pageant circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The prominence of the family -- John Ramsey, the millionaire  
president of Access Graphics, and Patsy, a former Miss West 
Virginia -- together with the beauty of the little blond victim 
guaranteed coverage of every twist in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ramseys issued a statement Wednesday night, saying the  
family ``lives in a nightmare'' and asking that the investigation 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
	``We take no satisfaction in this result because a child killer  
remains free and undetected,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was before dawn on the day after Christmas in 1996 when Patsy  
Ramsey said she found a 2 1/2-page ransom note on the back staircase 
in the family's home that demanded $118,000 for the safe return of 
JonBenet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Listen Carefully!'' the note begins. ``We are a group of  
individuals that represent a small foreign faction. We respect your 
business but not the country that it serves. At this time we have 
your daughter in our possession.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eight hours later, Ramsey said he found his daughter's body in a  
basement room, wrapped in a white blanket. A rope was wrapped 
around her neck and a wrist and tied to a stick. 
</P>
<P>
	A red-ink heart was drawn on her left palm, and Ramsey told  
police he removed duct tape from the child's mouth before carrying 
her body upstairs. 
</P>
<P>
	An autopsy concluded JonBenet suffered a skull fracture, was  
strangled and beaten, and may have been sexually assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities cleared JonBenet's brother, Burke, who was 9 at the  
time she died. The Ramseys initially told police Burke was sleeping 
when the ransom note was discovered, but his voice later was heard 
on an enhanced tape of Mrs. Ramsey's 911 call to police.	   Critics claimed the investigation was compromised early when 
detectives, believing they were dealing with a kidnapping, allowed 
friends and family to roam through the Ramsey mansion. They also 
asked Ramsey to conduct a search, which led to the discovery of the 
body. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation also was fractured by infighting between  
police and prosecutors over the best way to proceed. Two 
investigators resigned; one accused prosecutors of protecting the 
Ramseys and blocking police efforts to solve the case, while the 
other contended his fellow officers were improperly targeting 
innocent people -- including the Ramseys. 
</P>
<P>
	The two investigators held two theories about JonBenet's killer:  
one focused on the parents; the other on an intruder. The Ramseys, 
who now live in suburban Atlanta, have repeatedly denied any 
involvement in the crime. They offered a $100,000 reward and 
mounted a newspaper campaign seeking JonBenet's killer. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities amassed evidence that supported both theories.  
</P>
<P>
	Lab tests concluded the ransom note was written with a pen and  
pad that belonged to the Ramseys. Handwriting experts ruled Ramsey 
out as the author, but said Mrs. Ramsey's writing samples were 
inconclusive. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado Bureau of Investigation agents concluded four fibers on  
the duct tape allegedly taken from JonBenet's mouth were consistent 
with a jacket her mother wore Christmas night, according to 
published reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Evidence pointing to an intruder includes a broken basement  
window and an apparent pry mark found on a kitchen doorjamb, but 
there were no signs of forced entry into the home or footprints in 
the snow outside. 
</P>
<P>
	Other evidence of an intruder: Investigators have reportedly  
been unable to identify DNA material found in JonBenet's underwear, 
a pubic hair found on the blanket or a palm print pulled from the 
wine cellar door. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boulder County grand jury of eight women and four men began  
hearing evidence in the case in September 1998, listening to 
testimony from family, friends and police detectives. Its term was 
set to expire Oct. 20. 
</P>
<P>
	The cost of the case has nearly topped $2 million for federal,  
state, county and city agencies.

<HEADLINE> Reform Party Riddled With Factions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- As the competition begins for the Reform  
Party presidential nomination, the candidates will find a landscape 
littered with factionalism, local rivalries and mistrust. 
</P>
<P>
	That's been underscored in state conventions the party has held,  
amid signs that some in the party are building walls to keep out 
backers of commentator Pat Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really is hypocrisy,'' said Donna Donovan, of the  
Connecticut Reform Party. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue takes on new urgency with reports that Buchanan later  
this month will bolt the Republican Party and instead seek the 
presidency under the Reform Party banner. 
</P>
<P>
	His path to that nomination will be complicated, with some in  
the party reluctant to turn over the levers of power without a 
fight. Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura is the party's top elected 
official, and he has his faction, among others. 
</P>
<P>
	Factional fighting marked a party convention in Connecticut, and  
a similar gathering in New Hampshire was postponed when it became 
clear Buchanan backers would jam the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The Iowa Reform Party is preparing for its convention this  
weekend, and there's a history of factionalism in that group that 
predates Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Young, a top official of the Iowa party, is pushing to limit  
who participates. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's no effort to squeeze out anybody,'' insists Young. ``I  
revised the rules so someone couldn't storm the doors and take over 
the party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young argues that participants should be voters who were  
registered in the Reform Party for the last election, or who were 
``visibly active in the party'' as of Sept. 16, one month before 
the state convention. 
</P>
<P>
	That, of course, would keep any Buchanan backers from playing a  
role, and there's a distinctly Minnesota flavor to the convention. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick McCluhan, chairman of the Minnesota Reform Party, talks at  
lunch, while Minnesota Lt. Gov. Mae Schunk is keynoting. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really driven by what could happen if we let these people  
in,'' said Donovan. ``I think that if there are these kind of 
activities going on, now is the time to bring them to light and 
address them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sherry Blue, who says she's running to head the Iowa Reform  
Party, argues for a far more open process, letting anyone 
participate who is willing to sign a statement backing the party. 
</P>
<P>
	The party descended from Ross Perot's United We Stand operation  
and has a history of factionalism, splitting into warring camps on 
several occasions. The party lost its ballot status in the last 
election, and now has ballot access in only 21 states. 
</P>
<P>
	There also are serious questions about the party's impact. As of  
the last election, there were exactly 922 registered Reform party 
voters in Iowa, out of a registered voter universe of 1.9 million. 
It also is beginning to draw perennial candidates who have been 
associated with fringe causes. Sue Atkinson is an organizer and 
she's been associated with extremist Lyndon LaRouche. 
</P>
<P>
	While Young heads the Iowa party, he splits his time between  
Iowa and Virginia and also holds a national party post. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Reform Party increasingly is seen as a joke,'' said Drake  
University political science professor Dennis Goldford. ``They just 
haven't been a force here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Perot got as much as 18 percent of the vote, polls this  
year have seen Buchanan drawing only 9 percent in a projected 
three-way matchup. 
</P>
<P>
	Young argued that there's no agenda involved in the Reform Party  
machinations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of simple,'' said Young. ``It is designed  
specifically to avoid an unfriendly takeover.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He insists all are welcome.  
</P>
<P>
	``I happen to like Pat Buchanan,'' said Young. ``I like Jesse  
Ventura. I don't really have the luxury of my own ideology.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It should be noted that the state conventions are the mechanism  
used to pick a party presidential nominee, but the battling that's 
going on indicates the sort of struggle that Buchanan and others 
will have to sort through to seize control of the party. 
</P>
<P>
	The party will select its nominee through a unique, mail-in  
ballot next summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Names other than Buchanan have been mentioned. Ventura has said  
he isn't running, but suspicions remain. Developer Donald Trump has 
expressed an interest as well.

<HEADLINE> City Wants To Boot Big Dairy Farm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (AP) -- In 1905, when the Thomsons first took  
over a dairy farm, family members peddled milk on the city streets, 
pouring it into their customers' outstretched bowls. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the family says, the city wants them out of town.  
</P>
<P>
	After two years of fighting, the Thomsons have learned that  
Springfield intends to condemn their 350-acre farm to build a new 
industrial park. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm too old to move,'' said 76-year-old Robert ``Bud''  
Thomson. ``My grandfather and dad both farmed here and died here, 
and I plan to do the same.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Lee Gannaway insists that Thomson's land is needed to keep  
the proposed industrial park within the bounds of the Springfield 
school district. He says the district stands to lose out on $1.7 
million in additional tax revenues over 10 years unless the farm is 
sold. 
</P>
<P>
	In a closed meeting this week, the city council unanimously  
agreed that declaring eminent domain over the Thomson farm was 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	``None of us like to be in the business of eminent domain,''  
Gannaway said. ``But there is a public good we have to look at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Standing in his bib overalls and stained baseball cap, Thomson  
explains that he cannot sell his farm because he and his family -- 
including five children and four grandchildren who work there -- 
have no place else to go. 
</P>
<P>
	The family has roots in southwest Missouri that go back to the  
first part of the century when Frank Thomson, Robert's grandfather, 
started the Holstein farm. The family made the national news in 
1993 by raising a cow that set the world's record in producing milk 
-- 59,300 pounds that year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We aren't against development, we just don't want to be the  
sacrificial lamb,'' said Thomson's wife, Marianna. 
</P>
<P>
	Chamber of Commerce officials say there is a need to move  
forward on the industrial park to keep manufacturing companies 
coming to the area. Manufacturing is the area's biggest industry, 
topping health care and tourism. 
</P>
<P>
	Ralph Rognstad, Jr., assistant director of planning and  
development in Springfield, said the Thomson farm is in a key 
location because it is close to both railway and highway access. 
</P>
<P>
	Missouri ranks poorly when it comes to protecting prime farmland  
from urban sprawl, says Megan Fowler, a spokeswoman for the San 
Francisco-based Sierra Club. 
</P>
<P>
	In a recently issued report from the environmental group,  
Missouri ranked 44th out of the 50 states in protecting open 
spaces. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the city has received nearly 200 calls this week,  
mostly in favor of the Thomsons, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We aren't sure what we need to do yet to fight this, but we  
will be putting up a good fight,'' Mrs. Thomson said. ``And there's 
a high-powered hose in the barn we can use to clean up with when 
the fighting is over.''

<HEADLINE> L.A. Schools Chief Defies Board </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The nation's second-largest school district  
was in a state of confusion Thursday after the superintendent 
defied a move by the school board to strip him of his day-to-day 
control. 
</P>
<P>
	The district is struggling with low test scores and a scandal  
over a $200 million high school built on a badly polluted site. On 
Tuesday, the school board voted to appoint Howard Miller chief 
executive and gave him ``complete authority'' over everything from 
construction to instruction. 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, Superintendent Ruben Zacarias met with Miller and  
then asserted that he was still the boss. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is only one superintendent in charge of this district  
and you are looking at him,'' Zacarias said. ``I can always use an 
extra pair of hands. Mr. Miller does report to me. He takes 
direction from me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Becki Robinson, vice president of United Teachers-Los Angeles,  
the union for instructors in the 700,000-student district, called 
the situation ``very distressing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We seem to have a train speeding down the track without a  
conductor on board -- or two conductors wanting to go in different 
directions,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hispanic lawmakers who support Zacarias were angry at the  
appointment of Miller by newly elected school board members. 
</P>
<P>
	``By expanding his authority, they have violated the goodwill  
and trust we placed on these individuals,'' said state Sen. Richard 
Polanco, a Democrat. ``It's a clear-cut attempted coup by a shadowy 
corporate elite entity, and we won't stand for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller was a school board member in the 1970s until he was  
recalled in a voter backlash against the use of forced busing to 
integrate schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, he was appointed head of the troubled facilities  
division after the board determined that development plans for 100 
new schools were so far behind that the district probably would 
miss a July deadline to qualify for up to $900 million in state 
bond money. 
</P>
<P>
	As CEO, his marching orders include assembling a crisis  
management team to make a ``top-to-bottom'' management review and 
recommend a reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
	He also was given until Oct. 22 to recommend action against nine  
school district managers involved in the fiasco over the Belmont 
Learning Center -- the nation's costliest high school. Construction 
began on the school even though its site, a former gas and oil 
field, emits explosive methane and other toxic gases. 
</P>
<P>
	District officials are still deciding whether the school should  
ever open.

<HEADLINE> Senator Accuses HUD of Manipulation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Senate committee chairman accused Housing  
and Urban Development Department officials of manipulating an 
investigation to discredit the department's inspector general, a 
woman who has questioned the policies of Secretary Andrew Cuomo. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., Governmental Affairs Committee  
chairman, said Thursday that outside lawyers were charging HUD 
$300,000 to investigate racial discrimination charges against 
Inspector General Susan Gaffney. Such inquiries normally cost about 
$3,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	HUD spokesman David Egner disputed the $300,000 figure, saying  
it was ``flat out wrong to say HUD has paid or will pay anything 
more than the $100,000 specified in its contracts for this 
investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	HUD's chief procurement officer, V. Stephen Carberry, insisted  
the department acted properly in seeking outside counsel to probe 
Deputy Assistant Inspector General Philip X. Newsome's complaint 
that Gaffney, in not selecting him for a promotion, discriminated 
against him because he is black. 
</P>
<P>
	``Charges of discrimination involving a high official are a  
serious matter that require a serious investigation,'' Carberry 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The department initially contracted with a government-listed  
investigative firm to look into the complaint at a cost of $2,700. 
</P>
<P>
	But the General Accounting Office, checking into it at  
Thompson's request, found senior HUD officials stopped that inquiry 
in August 1998 and contracted with two outside law firms to 
investigate the specific charges and whether there was more 
systematic discrimination in the office. This decision ``was a 
significant deviation from HUD's standard Equal Employment 
Opportunity process,'' said GAO, the investigative arm of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson said Cuomo's office had ``manipulated the procurement  
process'' in an ``extraordinary effort to discredit this longtime 
public servant and to portray her as something she is not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., head of the Congressional Black  
Caucus, defended HUD's decision to hire Deval Patrick -- a former 
Clinton administration assistant attorney general for civil rights 
-- to look into the allegations. ``Anything less would have been a 
failure by HUD to meet its legal and moral obligations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gaffney and Cuomo's top aides have clashed over HUD attempts to  
reorganize itself and initiate new housing and empowerment 
programs. There were also disputes over her office's selection of 
three cities run by black mayors as sites for an effort to uncover 
housing program corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	At a Senate hearing in March, Gaffney said Cuomo was a ``very  
ambitious man'' who ``looks at me as a threat, as a problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Secretary Saul Ramirez replied then that Gaffney had  
taken a ``destructive, attack approach'' to HUD. 
</P>
<P>
	Newsome, the highest ranking black in the office, has since  
taken his case to a federal court.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Outraged At Being Targeted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- With three U.N. workers killed this week  
and seven others taken hostage, the United Nations is expressing 
outrage that it is being targeted and demanding a ``sea change'' in 
the way its people are protected overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	The incidents -- in particular the execution of two U.N. aid  
workers in Burundi and the shotgun slaying of a U.N. civilian 
official in Kosovo -- have underscored the bleak trend that came to 
the fore last year, when for the first time, more U.N. civilians 
were killed on the job than U.N. military personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot and should not view these killings as an isolated  
incident,'' UNICEF executive director Carol Bellamy said Wednesday. 
``They are part of a contemporary and continually expanding pattern 
in which humanitarian workers are being identified and targeted for 
death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More and more often, U.N. personnel are working in war zones  
where militant groups are fighting internal struggles -- and 
ignoring international norms of protecting U.N. civilian and 
humanitarian workers, she said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this year, 13 U.N. staffers working on civilian missions  
have been killed. In 1998, 24 were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. spokesman Manoel de Almeida e Silva rejected suggestions  
Wednesday that the United Nations should rethink its strategy of 
protecting its staffers abroad, saying the onus lay squarely with 
governments hosting U.N. missions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's not lose sight of where the problem is,'' he said.  
``Some people are responsible for what is happening. Some people 
are responsible for ensuring security of staff that are guests in 
their countries and are there to help and/or protect populations 
that are in need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seven U.N. workers were taken hostage Wednesday near the  
breakaway Georgian territory of Abkhazia by unidentified gunmen 
just after the workers arrived by helicopter to deliver aid. 
</P>
<P>
	Four of the seven later were released, a top Georgian security  
official, Nugzar Sadzhaya, said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Sadzhaya, secretary of the National Security Council, did not  
provide details of the release or information on the condition of 
the remaining hostages. 
</P>
<P>
	In Burundi on Tuesday, Hutu rebels executed UNICEF's  
representative in the country and the World Food Program logistics 
officer at point-blank range. The United Nations suspended its 
operations in the country for three days following the attack, in 
which seven other people were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	And on Monday night, a Bulgarian national reporting for his  
first day of duty with the U.N. civilian mission in Kosovo was 
beaten and shot to death in Pristina after speaking to ethnic 
Albanians in the Serbian language. 
</P>
<P>
	The Security Council on Wednesday condemned the slayings and  
demanded the immediate release of the hostages. Council President 
Sergey Lavrov of Russia said the Georgian incident was an act of 
``international terrorism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	UNICEF's Bellamy called for a ``sea change'' in the way world  
governments protect aid workers, demanding that governments enforce 
laws protecting U.N. civilians and punish those who violate them. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they continue to avoid that responsibility, they abandon  
defenseless men, women and children to the mindless brutality of 
armed thugs and terrorists,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We owe it to those courageous humanitarian workers who have  
already given their lives to set a new course: one that allows 
relief assistance to be provided wherever and whenever necessary, 
but which is also founded upon an unshakable and shared commitment 
to protect those who serve.''

<HEADLINE> Intel To Buy Wireless Chipmaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Intel Corp. is paying $1.6 billion to buy DSP  
Communications Inc., a maker of microprocessors for mobile phones, 
in a bid to extend its dominance in computer chips to the coming 
boom in wireless devices with Internet access. 
</P>
<P>
	DSP supplies integrated circuits and related system software for  
mobile phone manufacturers based on the wireless technology called 
digital signal processing. 
</P>
<P>
	Its customers include Lucent Technologies, Motorola, NEC, Denso,  
Kyocera, and Sanyo. The company is based in Cupertino, Calif., 
though most of its operations are located in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	For Intel, the deal adds a key technology that's at the very  
heart of the latest rage in the technology and telecommunications 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
	While beepers and other wireless devices with online services  
and e-mail are already available, untethered Internet access has 
emerged as an especially hot theme since the introduction last 
month of Web phone service by Sprint PCS. 
</P>
<P>
	This week's Telecom 99 trade show in Switzerland has been  
largely a frantic dash to unveil new capabilities for the first 
wave of wireless Internet phones, as well as future devices based 
on the next generation of wireless technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, the leading manufacturer of semiconductors for personal  
computers has been moving aggressively to make sure it plays a 
similar role in the development of network and wireless technology, 
areas with far more growth potential than desktop machines. 
</P>
<P>
	So while Intel already makes memory chips for cell phones that  
process and store data such as phone numbers and messages, DSP will 
enable it to also produce the chips that transmit that data between 
a mobile handset and a wireless network. 
</P>
<P>
	``This acquisition is an important element of Intel's plan to  
become the leading building block supplier to the Internet,'' the 
company said in a press release. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig Barrett, president and chief executive of the Santa Clara,  
Calif.-based Intel, added that, ``Cellular technology is emerging 
as a new high-speed method of connecting to the Internet and we 
believe over time will become increasingly important for connecting 
PCs to the Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The all-cash deal announced Thursday values DSP at $36 a share,  
or a premium of more than 25 percent above Wednesday's closing 
stock price of $28 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	DSP shares rose $6.31 1/4 to $34.93 3/4 in trading on the New York  
Stock Exchange. Intel shares rose $1.21 7/8 to $73.34 3/8 in trading on 
the Nasdaq Stock Market.

<P>
	HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- A man who nicknamed himself ``Animal''  
was executed by injection Thursday for the rape and slaying of an 
18-year-old high school cheerleader, one of three people killed 
during a daylong murder spree in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry McFadden, 51, made no final statement.  
</P>
<P>
	The mother of victim Suzanne Denise Harrison burst into tears as  
she entered the death chamber, crying, ``He looked at me.'' She 
turned away and said, ``He took our children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The victim's brother, Craig Harrison, got as close to the window  
as he could to see McFadden gasp and sputter twice. ``He's 
gutless,'' Harrison said of McFadden. 
</P>
<P>
	The discovery of the three victims from Hawkins, about 100 miles  
east of Dallas, and subsequent arrest of McFadden, on parole after 
three rape convictions, made the former telephone cable installer 
one of the region's most notorious criminals. 
</P>
<P>
	The long-haired, tattoo-covered McFadden enhanced the reputation  
when he broke out of the Upshur County Jail before his capital 
murder trial. He took a female jailer hostage and for three days 
evaded one of the most intense manhunts in Texas history. A dragnet 
involved some 1,200 officers before McFadden was caught. 
</P>
<P>
	The jailer managed to escape unhurt from a railroad boxcar.  
</P>
<P>
	McFadden was condemned for raping and beating Ms. Harrison, then  
strangling her with her own underwear. Two friends who accompanied 
her on May 4, 1986, for a Sunday drive were shot to death. 
</P>
<P>
	McFadden never was charged with the other killings.  
</P>
<P>
	In Utah early Friday, 35-year-old Joseph Mitchell Parsons was  
executed by injection for fatally stabbing Richard Ernest in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Ernest was killed and robbed hours after he  
picked up a hitchhiking Parsons. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspect said he stabbed Ernest in self-defense after the  
other man made a homosexual advance, but prosecutors said the 
wounds appeared to have been inflicted while Ernest was sleeping.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When Melvin Mora says he's come a long way to  
get to the NL championship series, he isn't kidding. 
</P>
<P>
	Mora, the New York Mets' valuable utility man, spent the  
beginning of last season playing for the Mercury Tigers of the 
Chinese Professional Baseball League. 
</P>
<P>
	``People think if you go to Taiwan you can't come back,'' Mora  
said. ``I know it's a long way to go, but I didn't make the major 
league camp so I said I'll see what happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What he hoped for was a chance to impress scouts from the  
higher-paying Japanese League. Instead he caught the eye of Mets 
assistant general manager Jim Duquette, who brought him back the 
United States with the opportunity to play Triple-A. 
</P>
<P>
	And Mora was happy for the chance.  
</P>
<P>
	``There are pretty good pitchers over there, but this is real  
baseball here,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	After hitting .421 in spring training, Mora shuttled back and  
forth from the minors before making a name for himself this month. 
</P>
<P>
	On the final day of the regular season, Mora singled in the  
ninth inning and eventually scored the game-winning run on a wild 
pitch to help put New York in a one-game wild-card playoff with 
Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	In Game 4 of the first playoff round against Arizona, Mora threw  
out Jay Bell at the plate after entering the game in left field as 
a defensive replacement in the eighth inning. That kept the Mets 
within one run and they went on to eliminate the Diamondbacks on 
Todd Pratt's 10th-inning homer. 
</P>
<P>
	He got his chance in the NLCS on Wednesday, when he replaced the  
ill Rickey Henderson and then hit his first career homer in the 
fifth inning off Kevin Millwood. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they put me in, I will give 100 percent,'' Mora said. ``I  
don't get nervous because it's the same game I've always played.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only now, it's no longer on the other side of the world.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *GLAVINE'S ROOTS:* Game 3 starter Tom Glavine returned to his  
roots Thursday night, even thought it meant passing up a chance to 
watch the team he rooted for as a child. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Braves worked out at Shea Stadium, Glavine headed to a  
game between the expansion Atlanta Thrashers and New York Islanders 
at nearby Nassau County Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	The Massachusetts native was drafted by the Los Angeles Kings as  
a teen-ager but chose baseball instead. He owns a luxury box for 
Thrashers games at Philips Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though he wasn't at the ALCS, Glavine still keeps up with  
the Red Sox. His sister ``must have called me 15 times'' during 
Boston's Game 5 victory over Cleveland in the division series, he 
said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, the kid in me is happy for the Red Sox, because I'm  
still a Red Sox fan,'' said Glavine, who relishes the possibility 
of a Boston-Atlanta World Series. ``That looms on the horizon for 
me personally. But it's something that is way off in the future 
right now, because we've still got an awful lot of baseball to play 
in this series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glavine praised Red Sox manager Jimy Williams, a former  
third-base coach for the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	``At times, he's been criticized up there for what people  
perceive as not quite the guy they wanted for the job,'' Glavine 
said. ``But he's done a tremendous job.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BAYLOR'S FUTURE:* Don Baylor appears to be in the final days of  
his tenure with the Braves. Even his boss sees no chance of him 
returning as Atlanta's hitting coach in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Baylor, manager of the Colorado Rockies from 1993-98, has  
interviewed for vacancies with the Anaheim Angels and Chicago Cubs. 
The Milwaukee Brewers, whose new general manager, Dean Taylor, came 
from Atlanta, will likely be interested, as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Baylor has declined to comment on his future, but manager Bobby  
Cox didn't hesitate to give his opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure he's not going to be back,'' Cox said. ``I'm sure  
he's going to get a major-league (managing) job. I wish he was 
coming back. But obviously he's going to get a big-league job.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BASEBALL CAPITAL:* For one week at least, the baseball world  
will be focused on New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees and Red Sox played in the ALCS on Wednesday and  
Thursday, and the Braves and Mets play Friday, Saturday and Sunday. 
The Braves players could feel the fever as soon as they landed in 
the city Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's crazy,'' Brian Jordan said. ``I bet you can't get a hotel  
room in the entire city. There's a lot of excitement in this 
town.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan said he wasn't caught up enough in the drama to go to  
Yankee Stadium to watch Thursday night's game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to go see a baseball game,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Plenty of other people do. Both Yankees games were sold out and  
the Mets -- unlike the Braves -- have no seats remaining this 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SLEEP ON IT:* Even after a night of rest -- albeit on the couch  
in his Shea Stadium office -- Mets manager Bobby Valentine can't 
understand why Rey Ordonez bunted with runners on first and third 
and none out in the second inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Ordonez made the decision to bunt on his own, and lined the ball  
right to first baseman Brian Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We understand the mindset,'' Valentine said. ``It was just  
something that could have been done later in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would have been good if they were surprised instead of me  
being surprised. That's for sure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kenny Rogers followed with a sacrifice bunt -- two pitches after  
Valentine had taken the bunt sign off -- and the Braves got out of 
the inning when Rickey Henderson grounded out. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *UNDER THE WEATHER:* A few of the Mets are feeling the effects  
of the stomach flu that forced Rickey Henderson out of Game 2 in 
the second inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Bobby Valentine said that reliever Dennis Cook and Game  
4 starter Rick Reed complained of an upset stomach when they 
arrived at Shea Stadium for Thursday's workout. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little tough to decipher between flu and what everyone  
is feeling after getting in at 3 a.m.,'' Valentine said. ``Rickey 
felt better. He wasn't having those migraines or feeling like he 
had to vomit, so I guess that's good news. He should be OK for 
tomorrow.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Nuclear Program to Be Reviewed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- While America's nuclear weapons remain ``safe,  
secure and reliable,'' Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said 
Thursday he had ordered an across-the-board review of a $4.5 
billion program that is supposed to keep them that way without 
nuclear testing. 
</P>
<P>
	The reliability of the nuclear weapons stockpile -- along with  
verification of the conduct of other nations -- became a key part of 
the Senate debate over ratification of the nuclear test ban treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the Senate's failure to ratify the treaty, President  
Clinton vowed Thursday he would not resume nuclear tests. The 
United States conducted its last nuclear test at the Nevada test 
site in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Without testing, the Energy Department has been working for  
several years to develop sophisticated computer codes and other 
technology to simulate tests so the weapons can continue to be 
certified as ready if needed. 
</P>
<P>
	The computer programs, being developed at the Los Alamos weapons  
lab in New Mexico, and a $1.5 billion laser system being built at 
the Lawrence Livermore lab in California -- both key parts of the 
test simulations -- are not expected to be ready for five to 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	This program ``rests on developing an unprecedented set of  
scientific tools to better understand nuclear weapons'' as well as 
enhanced surveillance and new manufacturing methods to extend the 
life of aging warheads, Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was ordering the internal review -- to be completed  
within 30 days -- to examine progress made over the past three years 
and to ``ensure our continued confidence'' in the program. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, Richardson found out that the $1.5 billion laser  
project -- known as the National Ignition Facility -- had run into 
trouble and now could cost $350 million more than originally 
expected and be delayed for two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Some weapons experts have been skeptical that the  
computer-driven simulations will be an adequate substitute for 
actual testing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tests had a way of crystalizing answers. ... That is  
something that we will be missing in the future,'' Paul Robinson, 
director of the Sandia National Laboratories, told a Senate Armed 
Services Committee hearing last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Another lab director, John Browne at Los Alamos, said  
maintaining the safety and reliability of the weapons stockpile 
without nuclear testing ``is an unprecedented technical challenge'' 
and still ``a work in progress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, both lab directors, as well as C. Bruce Tarter,  
director of the Lawrence Livermore lab, later issued a joint 
statement saying while ``there can never be a guarantee,'' they 
were ``confident that a fully supported and sustained stockpile 
stewardship program will enable us to continue to maintain 
America's nuclear deterrent without nuclear testing.''

<HEADLINE>  Kobe Bryant Out With Broken Hand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Los Angeles Lakers guard Kobe Bryant  
will be sidelined at least six weeks after breaking his right hand 
in the first quarter of the team's first exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant's hand was hit by an errant elbow as he went for a  
rebound in Wednesday night's 88-84 loss to the Washington Wizards. 
He continued to play and 18 points, five assists, four steals and 
no turnovers in 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``He played the rest of the game, didn't realize it was broken  
until this morning and complained of pain,'' team spokesman John 
Black said. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors examined Bryant's hand in Los Angeles on Thursday and  
X-rays revealed he had broken the fourth metacarpal bone, Black 
said. He was fitted with a cast to just below his elbow, which 
he'll wear for about two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll be working out as of today, doing conditioning and  
stuff, working on his left-handed jump shot and hook shot,'' Black 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant's injury occurred the same day the Lakers signed free  
agent guard Ron Harper to a two-year, $4.2 million contract. 
Harper, a starter on three NBA title teams in Chicago, is expected 
to provide the Lakers' backcourt with experience in coach Phil 
Jackson's triangle offense. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, center Travis Knight has a severely sprained right  
ankle and is expected to miss 3-4 weeks, Black said. He will be 
re-evaluated on a weekly basis.

<HEADLINE> Transplant Bill Strips Gov't Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government would lose virtually all  
authority to oversee the nation's transplant program under a bill 
headed to the House floor. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation, approved by the House Commerce Committee in a  
voice vote Wednesday, comes two months after the Institute of 
Medicine recommended more government oversight. 
</P>
<P>
	Pushing the bill are transplant surgeons and hospitals who  
complain the Department of Health and Human Services has tried to 
dictate transplant policy over their objections. 
</P>
<P>
	In a controversial regulation, the organization running the  
transplant program under an HHS contract was ordered to send more 
organs to the sickest patients. The current system distributes 
organs locally first, ensuring a reliable supply for programs 
around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers now are debating how much control the agency should  
have over the United Network for Organ Sharing. The bill considered 
Wednesday sides with the network, giving it authority to make all 
substantive decisions and making it difficult for HHS to choose any 
other group to run the program in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also makes it tougher for the general public to get  
data on the performance of individual transplant centers, and 
allows states to write their own laws keeping organs within their 
borders. 
</P>
<P>
	HHS Secretary Donna Shalala said she would recommend President  
Clinton veto the bill if it passes Congress. The legislation is 
poised to sail through the House, though the Senate probably will 
not consider it this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters argue the legislation will clarify that experts  
should make medical decisions, not bureaucrats. 
</P>
<P>
	``HHS is simply not qualified to dictate the nation's policies  
on organ allocation,'' said Rep. Michael Bilirakis, R-Fla., the 
bill's chief sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents counter that policy-making is the responsibility of  
government and complain that the bill cedes extraordinary power to 
a contractor. 
</P>
<P>
	``This bill gives the organ allocation contractor more power  
than its employer, and its employer is the American taxpayer,'' 
said Rep. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio. ``A private contractor certainly 
can lend its expertise to public policy, but they should not be 
able to dictate it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At stake is a multimillion-dollar transplant business, with  
transplant centers around the country worried that new policies 
would send scarce organs to large, regional centers that have more 
patients and longer waiting lists. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a fight about money,'' said Rep. Thomas Barrett,  
D-Wis. Transplant hospitals are good public citizens, he said, 
adding: ``We're not going to do anything to hurt them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The issue divides more on regional lines that partisan ones. No  
Republican spoke in favor of HHS at Wednesday's hearing, but 
several Democrats said they were backing their local hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're my people in my state ... and I'm going to support  
them,'' said Rep. Ralph Hall, D-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides have spent significant time and money pressing their  
case, and the department's supporters complained that the network 
used $1 million in patient fees to lobby Congress. But the 
committee rejected an amendment that would have barred the use of 
fees for lobbying. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress stepped into the fight over transplant policy last year  
after the new HHS regulations. Hoping the two sides could work out 
a compromise, Congress delayed the regulations for a year and asked 
the Institute of Medicine to study the system. 
</P>
<P>
	That study, issued in July, generally sided with HHS and  
recommended stronger federal oversight. Asked why Congress would 
weaken oversight in light of the report, Bilirakis said: ``That's 
what people who are against the bill would say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the arguments during the hearing focused on the agency  
regulations and how organs should be distributed. 
</P>
<P>
	Barrett said he worried that states will not try as hard to  
increase organ donation if they know that the organs go elsewhere. 
Rep. Heather Wilson, R-N.M., suggested families are more likely to 
donate if they know that the organs will help someone in their 
community. Others argued that families do not care who is helped. 
</P>
<P>
	HHS has promised to release revised regulations before next  
week, when the congressional freeze expires. Supporters of the bill 
said the department should have presented a compromise plan by now.

<HEADLINE> Lord Robertson Takes Over NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Britain's Lord Robertson took office as  
NATO's new secretary-general today, saying he would focus the 
alliance's efforts on strengthening Europe's defense role, building 
closer ties with Russia and creating conditions for lasting peace 
in the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look forward to a pretty heavy workload,'' Robertson told  
reporters as he arrived at NATO headquarters to start work. 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson said he would seek to build up the defense  
capabilities of NATO's European members, both in terms of troops 
and weaponry to create a more equal balance between Europe and the 
United States within the alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	The European allies needed more modern and efficient structures,  
he said, noting that while the Europeans spend two-thirds of what 
the Americans spend, they get lesser results in terms of 
capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to have a weapons system for the future,'' the new  
NATO chief said. ``It's not just a question of spending more money 
on defense ... it's also a question of spending more wisely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He stressed that, while strengthening their own capabilities,  
the Europeans should not neglect their relationship with the United 
States within the alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	``More Europe in NATO does not mean less North America,'' he  
said, adding ``a strong transatlantic connection'' was vital for 
the alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	All the NATO countries should learn to operate better together,  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Turning to NATO's relations with Russia, Robertson said he hoped  
the two sides would overcome their differences and work closely 
together on defense issues in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we move into the 21st century there are a lot of challenges  
before us. Most of these conflicts ... are common problems, both 
East and West. It is better that we tackle these problems 
together,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia was strongly opposed to NATO's air campaign against  
Yugoslavia. After the air strikes began March 24, Moscow broke off 
relations with the alliance and expelled the top NATO 
representatives to Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Even after helping to negotiate the peace settlement, Moscow  
argued with NATO over its role in the peacekeeping operation in 
Kosovo. Russian troops are now working with the NATO-led force and 
steps have been taken to patch up relations. 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson said NATO had a crucial role to play in the  
stabilization of the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	``My goal is a Balkans that is inside the European family of  
democratic values,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson, 53, was Britain's defense secretary until last  
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	He replaces Javier Solana, a former Spanish foreign minister who  
ended his four-year term a few months early to take up the new 
European Union post of foreign policy coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson is NATO's 10th secretary-general since the alliance  
was founded 50 years ago.

<HEADLINE> Many Will Work on New Year's Eve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Forget partying like it's 1999 -- these people  
will be treating New Year's Eve like a Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	While others celebrate the arrival of 2000, tens of thousands  
will be slaving away at work, doing everything from guarding 
computers and nuclear plants to publishing newspapers and making 
pizzas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be here, but there's gonna be a lot of other folks with  
me, so we'll have misery in a group,'' said Richard Eastman, a Bell 
Atlantic employee in Newport News, Va. ``I hope it's a very boring 
night for everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eastman will watch the clock strike midnight while overseeing  
mechanics who maintain computers that keep dial tones and long 
distance service humming along the East Coast. He's logged extra 
hours before during hurricanes and floods -- but obviously not for 
something like this. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Ralph DeSantis is hoping for a ``peaceful night at  
Three Mile Island.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As communications director for GPU Nuclear Inc., he'll handle  
media calls about possible Y2K problems at the nuclear reactor near 
Harrisburg, Pa. A partial meltdown occurred there in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	He's not expecting problems: The plant's safety systems are  
mechanical, not computer-operated, and the company has spent about 
$3 million to fix Y2K-sensitive equipment, DeSantis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, about 20 specialists and engineers will join the 80 or so  
workers on the Three Mile Island midnight shift. 
</P>
<P>
	DeSantis said many of his friends -- employees at hospitals,  
banks and other businesses -- also will be working. 
</P>
<P>
	``Actually, the new millennium doesn't kick in until 2001,'' he  
said. ``So maybe all the people who work this New Year's Eve will 
turn that one into the big party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Smith will be fielding calls, too. As director of media  
relations for Bell Atlantic, he'll stare down the year 2000 from an 
emergency operations center in New York, dealing with media 
inquiries, crank calls, rumors and Y2K bug panics. 
</P>
<P>
	New Year's Eve, already a busy time for the phone company, could  
overload the system this year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That rollover, the first few hours (after midnight), will be a  
time of crisis,'' he said. ``If people pick up the phone ... just 
to see if there's a dial tone, the network will begin to choke 
itself to protect its brain. You might assume the system has 
crashed ... and you can't call anybody, and the world is coming to 
an end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Smith said he'll feel a bit left out of the celebration,  
working on New Year's has an upside. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have the opportunity to be engaging the world and its  
anxieties about this once-in-a-lifetime event,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	If Smith can get a call out to order a pizza, a staff of fellow  
New Year's workers will be at the ready. Domino's Pizza expects a 
hectic night trying to deliver to late-night employees and private 
parties at home, said Cozette Phifer, a spokeswoman for the Ann 
Arbor, Mich.-based chain. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a challenge to staff everybody on a night as  
busy as that,'' Phifer said. ``It may even surpass our two busiest 
nights, which are Halloween and Super Bowl.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Brusic, executive editor of the Orange County Register, will  
spend the night with his staff, preparing a special edition 
highlighting the bustling area south of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll be our chance of really taking a look and seeing what  
people will be doing on the last day of the century,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	And then there are the Elvis impersonators.  
</P>
<P>
	The dawn of 2000 will find Ron Decar wearing a pompadour and  
rhinestones, crooning ``Falling in Love with You.'' He'll be Elvis 
at the ``Millennium Midnight Matrimony,'' to be held at his ``A 
Viva Las Vegas Wedding Chapel.'' As many as 30 couples will be 
married there simultaneously, then go outside to the Las Vegas 
Strip and watch the fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I live in a jumpsuit,'' he said. ``I'll probably wear my best  
one, which is the red, white and blue rhinestone one with the eagle 
on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What we do here is we try to leave people with a memory,''  
Decar said. ``It'll definitely be an easy (anniversary) to 
remember. Can't forget.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Chides GOP on Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A week from a budget deadline, President  
Clinton accused Republicans on Thursday of resorting to ``reckless 
partisanship, to gimmicks and gamesmanship,'' and said GOP plans 
for across-the-board spending cuts would be too drastic. 
</P>
<P>
	Responded Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.: ``If the  
choice comes down to protecting Social Security or cutting across 
the board just a little nick off of every program, I believe the 
American people would support that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen days into fiscal 2000, the partisan crossfire  
spotlighted the rising stakes as the White House and lawmakers 
focus on the remaining, most politically complex spending bills. So 
far, five of the 13 fiscal 2000 bills have been signed into law, 
and five of the remaining ones face veto threats. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid the verbal exchanges, Congress' tardy budget work inched  
ahead. Lawmakers voted final congressional approval to a $268 
billion Pentagon measure, while the House approved a compromise $99 
billion bill for veterans, housing and science programs. 
</P>
<P>
	With an eye toward the expiration Oct. 21 of a bill keeping  
agencies open, House and Senate leaders ordered the authors of the 
biggest and most controversial spending measure to try crafting a 
compromise that Congress could pass next week. The bill, exceeding 
$310 billion, covers education, health, human services and other 
social programs. 
</P>
<P>
	It seems certain that Congress will need at least one more  
stopgap extension while lawmakers and administration officials 
complete the final bills. Members of both parties say they expect 
Clinton would sign one, even though White House spokesman Joe 
Lockhart said, ``The president has made no such commitment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton himself used a White House news conference to prod  
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are legitimate differences of opinion, but we can put an  
end to reckless partisanship, to gimmicks and gamesmanship,'' he 
said. ``We can work for a season of progress, not a winter of 
politics, and I am committed to do just that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton also said across-the-board cuts Republicans are  
considering in all 13 bills ``could deny tens of thousands of 
children Head Start opportunities, drastically reduce medical 
research, sacrifice military readiness, jeopardize the safety of 
air traffic control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders played down the impact of the cuts, which they said  
would be 1 percent or less, and insisted they would honor their 
pledge to not use Social Security surpluses to pay for spending. 
They also noted that Clinton's own budget employed the same device 
they did: ``Saving'' money in fiscal 2000 by requiring that 
billions of dollars not be spent until 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``From day one, the president's budget proposals have either  
included tax increases or raids on the Social Security surplus,'' 
said House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. ``Neither of those 
options is acceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments:  
</P>
<P>
	--The Senate gave the defense bill final approval by 87-11. The  
measure cleared the House Wednesday and is expected to get 
Clinton's signature. It would provide the military's biggest pay 
raise in nearly two decades, slow the Air Force's F-22 ``stealth'' 
fighter program and seek to halt a Pentagon decline in readiness. 
It is also home to gimmicks such as declaring $7 billion in 
operations and maintenance programs an ``emergency,'' meaning the 
money would not count against spending limits. 
</P>
<P>
	--The House approved the veterans-housing bill by 406-18. Senate  
approval was planned Friday, and Clinton is expected to sign it. 
The measure gives Clinton even more than he requested for 
environmental, veterans health and space programs. It is also 
includes hundreds of projects for members' districts, from $150,000 
for a hands-on children's' museum in Florence, Ala., and $2 million 
to buttress a building against earthquakes at California State 
University in San Bernadino. 
</P>
<P>
	--House-Senate bargainers neared agreement on a $38 billion  
measure for the departments of Commerce, Justice and State. White 
House support seemed uncertain. One participant said the bill would 
provide $570 million for Clinton's proposal to help communities 
hire thousands of police officers, less than half of what he wants.

<HEADLINE> Florida Defense Kicks Into Gear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- The Florida defense appears back on  
track. Many people will credit the genius, Steve Spurrier, for that 
quick development. 
</P>
<P>
	A week after Spurrier said he needed to get more involved on the  
defensive side of the ball, the No. 7 Gators (5-1, 3-1 Southeastern 
Conference) improved. On Saturday, they play at Auburn (3-3, 1-3), 
a team that could make them look even better. 
</P>
<P>
	The Florida defense allowed just 165 yards last week in a 31-10  
victory over LSU. Spurrier said he set the tone early, then got out 
of the way and let coordinator Jon Hoke take over. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I called one defense the whole day,'' Spurrier said.  
``That was the corner blitz, on the third play. So he said, `OK 
now, that's what coach wants, I'll call that the rest of the day.' 
So we called five or six of those, five or six safety blitzes. So 
he knew to call what we've got and let's go play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those were the same blitzes that were missing in a 40-39 loss to  
Alabama the week before. Tide quarterback Andrew Zow sat in the 
pocket, unhurried, most of the game. Hoke conceded it was a 
tactical mistake on his part. 
</P>
<P>
	``We realize we just have to keep putting pressure on the  
quarterback,'' Hoke said. ``We have to bring different people from 
a lot of different places to make him uncomfortable back there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It may not even be that difficult against Auburn.  
</P>
<P>
	Redshirt freshman Jeff Klein is set to make his third start in  
place of injured junior Ben Leard. Klein is 35-for-77 with two 
touchdowns and five interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Auburn offense is ranked 11th in the SEC. The Tigers haven't  
gained more than 225 yards since Leard left the lineup. This is a 
bad sign for a team preparing to play Florida, which averages 41 
points per game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Against a Steve Spurrier team, you need to control the ball a  
little bit to give your defense a rest,'' Auburn coach Tommy 
Tuberville said. 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn's best chance would be to hope Florida makes enough  
mistakes to keep the game close. The Gators have been adept at that 
recently. They have lost 10 fumbles this year, second-worst in the 
nation, and are averaging 81 yards per game in penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuberville realizes that forcing mistakes and taking advantage  
of them are different things against the Florida defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``They made a radical change,'' Tuberville said. ``This past  
week, I saw a sense of urgency about them. They were flying around 
and they weren't as passive as they had been. I think how they are 
more reckless. I think that's right up coach Spurrier's 
repertoire.''

<HEADLINE> Michael Cooper Is New Sparks Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Michael Cooper, the former Los Angeles  
Lakers star who was a WNBA assistant last season, was hired 
Thursday as coach of the Los Angeles Sparks. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper succeeds Orlando Woolridge, who left Sept. 30 because of  
differences with team president and acting general manager Johnny 
Buss. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper signed a guaranteed three-year contract. Terms were not  
disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michael was the very first person I talked to about coaching  
this team,'' Buss said. ``It was just was a matter of time before 
Michael was going to take the helm. He's someone I always wanted. 
The timing was right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper was in charge of the Sparks' defense last season. Los  
Angeles was 11th in the 12-team league in points allowed, but it 
was second in rebounding and held opponents to the second-lowest 
shooting percentage in the WNBA. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sparks made the playoffs last season with a 20-12 record,  
second-best in the league. They lost to Houston in the Western 
Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper plans to meet with Buss before determining the offensive  
style he will employ. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether we're running or playing half-court basketball, it  
will be effective basketball, fun basketball and defensive-minded 
basketball,'' Cooper said. ``Those three things make you a 
championship team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During his 12-year NBA career, Cooper was on the league's  
All-Defensive first team five times and was defensive player of the 
year in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper was a Lakers assistant from 1994-98 before resigning to  
become a TV commentator. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Buss said the Sparks have been offered a 10-year  
renewal of their franchise by the WNBA. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it's possible the Sparks may play at the new Staples  
Center in downtown Los Angeles next season. Currently, the team 
plays at the Forum, which the Lakers and Kings have vacated to move 
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	``The league wants to see us move to the new building,'' Buss  
said. ``There's nothing wrong with that. It's all a matter of 
logistics and making sure it's not going to disrupt our ability to 
make money and win games.''

</P>
<P>
	On Oct. 15, 1969, peace demonstrators staged activities across  
the country, including a candlelight march around the White House, 
seeking a moratorium on the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
	On this date:  
</P>
<P>
	In 1914, the Clayton Antitrust Act was passed.

N.J., on its first commercial flight across the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1939, New York Municipal Airport, later renamed LaGuardia  
Airport, was dedicated. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1945, Pierre Laval, the former premier of Vichy, France, was  
executed. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1946, Nazi war criminal Hermann Goering poisoned himself  
hours before he was to have been executed. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1966, President Johnson signed a bill creating the Department  
of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>

vice-presidential nominees, Democrat Walter F. Mondale and 
Republican Bob Dole faced off in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was named winner  
of the Nobel Peace Prize. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, despite sexual harassment allegations by Anita Hill,  
the Senate confirmed, 52-48, the nomination of Clarence Thomas to 
the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years ago: South African officials released eight prominent  
political prisoners, including Walter Sisulu, a leader of the 
African National Congress. The NHL's Wayne Gretzky of the Los 
Angeles Kings surpassed Gordie Howe's scoring record of 1,850 
points, in a game against the Edmonton Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years ago: Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide  
returned to his country, three years after being overthrown by army 
rulers. The U.N. Security Council welcomed Aristide's return by 
voting to lift stifling trade sanctions imposed against Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
	One year ago: The White House and congressional leaders struck  
agreement on a $500 billion spending package, ending a week of 
election-season budget brinkmanship. The Federal Reserve made 
surprise cuts in two key interest rates, igniting an explosive 
rally on Wall Street. President Clinton opened Mideast summit talks

<HEADLINE> Hasbro Earnings Up About 40 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Hasbro Inc.'s third-quarter earnings  
climbed about 40 percent from a year ago, driven by demand for its 
Furby dolls, computer games and toys tied to ``Star Wars'' and 
Pokemon. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's second-largest toymaker earned $85 million, or 43  
cents a share, in the quarter ended Sept. 26, compared with $61 
million, or 30 cents a share, a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 results included a $13.6 million charge tied to its  
purchase of MicroProse Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales grew to $1.09 billion from $945.5 million for the same  
period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasbro's earnings matched Wall Street analysts' expectations.  
Its stock, however, fell $1.68 3/4, or 8 percent, to $19.25 in midday 
on the New York Stock Exchange amid concerns that its earnings' 
growth will slow in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
	It's been a strong year for Hasbro, thanks to the popularity of  
many of its products. While sales at Hasbro have soared, its rival 
-- No. 1 toymaker Mattel -- has disappointed Wall Street with weak 
sales and earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Furby, which was the blockbuster hit of last Christmas,  
continues to sell well, and the line of talking, furry dolls was 
extended during the third quarter to include Furby Babies. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of its toys tied to ``Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom  
Menace'' have also been strong and it has seen double-digit sales 
growth in its Hasbro Interactive division, which makes computer 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Also lifting earnings are its toys based on the popular Japanese  
cartoon Pokemon, including plush dolls and games. Hasbro will 
significantly expand its Pokemon line during the fourth quarter, 
including a new Pokemon Monopoly game and a Pokemon electronic 
organizer. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasbro also plans more growth in the Pokemon category thanks to  
its $325 million purchase last month of Wizards of the Coast, which 
sells Pokemon cards as well as the popular games, Magic: The 
Gathering and Dungeons &AMP; Dragons. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of the year, Hasbro earned $131.3  
million, or 64 cents a share, compared with $88.2 million, or 36 
cents a share. Sales were $2.6 billion, up from $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasbro, which is based in Pawtucket, R.I., makes toys under the  
Playskool, Kenner, Tonka, Milton Bradley, Parker Brothers, Tiger 
and Galoob toy and game brands.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton Targets Health Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOLTON LANDING, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton called  
Thursday for restoring trust to the nation's medical system, making 
it clear health care reform will be a focus of her campaign for a 
U.S. Senate seat from New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking before the Healthcare Association of New York State, a  
trade group representing hospitals and nursing homes, Mrs. Clinton 
said many Americans remember the era of television's Dr. Marcus 
Welby. 
</P>
<P>
	``When people fondly talk about some golden age of the past ...  
they want once again to be able to trust the system,'' she told an 
audience of about 400 people at the posh Sagamore Resort on the 
shores of Lake George. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton, who directed President Clinton's failed attempt to  
overhaul the nation's health care system, said she wasn't just 
talking about patients but also about hospital administrators, 
doctors, and nurses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many doctors today feel their professional discretion and  
autonomy are being taken away,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The address marked one of the first policy speeches of Mrs.  
Clinton's fledgling campaign and made it clear she planned to again 
tackle the issue she failed to push through Congress in 1994. She 
conceded Thursday that her plan then had been too ambitious. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the results of that effort, there are probably many who  
find it hard to understand why I would keep talking about health 
care,'' she said. ``The answer is simple. It's something I've been 
talking about and working on my entire adult life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked for his reaction to Mrs. Clinton's remarks, Healthcare  
Association president Daniel Sisto, said, ``She clearly offered the 
right prescription.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Continuing the health care theme, Mrs. Clinton spoke later  
Thursday to about 500 members of the New York State Nurses 
Association in Lake Placid. 
</P>
<P>
	``Often the kind of effort you put in is nothing short of  
heroic,'' the first lady told the nurses. ``We have to do more so 
nurses never have to choose between their patients and their 
jobs,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In her remarks in Bolton Landing, Mrs. Clinton attacked the  
balanced budget act of 1997, approved by Congress and her husband, 
saying it cut too far into the health care system. President 
Clinton and some members of Congress, including New York Sen. 
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, are looking to ease some of those cuts 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``These cuts went too far ... they have caused too much pain and  
are cutting into too much muscle and bone,'' the first lady said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This must be fixed and it needs to be fixed this year.''  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton is campaigning for the Senate seat being vacated by  
fellow Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan. It is a race that is 
expected to pit her against Republican New York City Mayor Rudolph 
Giuliani. 
</P>
<P>
	The trip was Mrs. Clinton's first to the Adirondack Mountains as  
a candidate. Earlier this year the first lady's camp came under 
fire after an unidentified advisor told the New York Daily News 
that the Clintons would never vacation in the ``fly infested'' 
Adirondacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton got to see the mountains in their fall splendor.  
The Adirondack foliage was at near peak color with red, orange, and 
yellow leaves wet from an overnight rain.

<HEADLINE> FEMA Buying Flood-Damaged Property </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- In what might be the biggest program of its  
kind, state and federal officials expect to spend up to $600 
million buying property and relocating people out of floodplains. 
</P>
<P>
	The move comes just weeks after catastrophic floods spawned by  
Hurricane Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to help North Carolinians rebuild. And we want to help  
them rebuild out of harm's way -- out of the flood plain,'' said 
John Copenhaver, regional director of the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``FEMA has done buyouts before. But this buyout is designed to  
be faster and larger in scope than any others.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Tolbert, state emergency management director, said Thursday  
the buyouts are expected to cost $500 million to $600 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Two buyout projects -- in Kinston and Goldsboro -- already have  
been approved. Officials have met with leaders from 15 communities 
and plan to meet with officials from at least 60 more communities 
in eastern North Carolina in the next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan is expected to surpass the 8,000 buyouts that followed  
Hurricane Fran in 1996. Tolbert said 15,280 homes have been 
reported uninhabitable because of the flooding, and 6,344 of them 
have been described as destroyed by their owners. 
</P>
<P>
	People whose properties are approved for the buyouts will be  
offered fair-market, pre-flood values for their properties, said 
Gavin Smith, the state's disaster mitigation director. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the program, buyout applications will be made by  
communities, and not individual property owners, who must contact 
local officials if they wish to participate.

<HEADLINE> Old Canaveral Launch Pad Demolished </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- With hundreds of aerospace workers  
shouting the countdown, a historic launch pad was blown up Thursday 
with 180 pounds of explosives to make way for a new line of 
rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	``5-4-3-2-1! Blasting into the future!'' Lockheed Martin Corp.  
launch manager Adrian Laffitte proclaimed as Launch Complex 41 came 
down in a party atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid pops and booms and flames and smoke, the two launch towers,  
one 200 feet high, the other 300 feet, crumpled to the ground in a 
heap of 7 million pounds of steel to be recycled. 
</P>
<P>
	A few hundred rocket scientists and launch pad workers screamed  
with excitement from 2,500 feet away as the towers toppled like 
falling trees in a matter of seconds. Hundreds if not thousands of 
other workers at Cape Canaveral Air Station and adjoining Kennedy 
Space Center watched. 
</P>
<P>
	Built in 1965, Launch Complex 41 was the starting point for  
NASA's Viking missions to Mars and Voyager missions to the outer 
planets, and numerous spy satellites. In all, 27 Titan rockets 
blasted off from the pad. 
</P>
<P>
	Like others in the crowd, engineer Troxel Fitzpatrick couldn't  
help but feel a bit sad. ``History coming down,'' he observed. 
</P>
<P>
	But, boy, what a thrill it was to blow up a pad on purpose,  
especially for people in a line of work that loathes explosions. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first time I've seen something like this -- pretty  
exciting,'' said Air Force Lt. Col. Anthony Goins, a launch 
squadron commander. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time a Cape Canaveral launch pad was deliberately blown  
up was back in 1976, when John Glenn's deteriorating pad was 
brought down by the Army. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed Martin opted for Thursday's $1 million  
demolition-by-explosives to save time and money. It is expected to 
take only a month or two to haul away all the steel; dismantling 
the towers piece by piece would have taken much longer. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's new, powerful Atlas V rockets will not need launch  
towers once they begin lifting off in 2001, thus the need for a 
cleared pad. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is progress,'' observed Elgin Kirkland, a NASA retiree  
who worked on all of the space agency's launches from Launch 
Complex 41. 
</P>
<P>
	To raise money for needy families at Christmas, Lockheed Martin  
sold 350 raffle tickets at $5 each for the chance to push a 
make-believe detonation button. (The real button was pushed by the 
pros.) 
</P>
<P>
	An Air Force engineer, Jack Olski, won the raffle but let his  
7-year-old son and 4-year-old daughter do the honors. He, his wife 
and children wore $10 T-shirts emblazoned ``Blasting out of the 
Past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes way for the new rockets,'' Olski said. ``But a lot of  
work went into keeping this pad alive. It wasn't built to last this 
long and it has. Time to move on.''

<HEADLINE> Where Candidates Stand on Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Snapshot: The U.S. Senate Thursday voted 51-48 against  
ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, far short of the 
required 67 votes needed to ratify the treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	Positions of the Democratic and Republican presidential  
candidates on the treaty: 

</P>
<P>
	DEMOCRATS:   	
</P>
<P>
	Bill Bradley: Supported treaty. Bradley believes that the treaty  
would ``strengthen the international consensus for 
non-proliferation'' and strengthen our ability to monitor and 
inspect suspicious behavior by other nations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore: Supported treaty. After the Senate voted  
against ratification he called their decision ``breathtakingly 
irresponsible.'' Will air a campaign ad in which he promises to 
make the treaty an issue in the 2000 race. 

</P>
<P>
	REPUBLICANS:   	
</P>
<P>
	Gary Bauer: Opposed treaty. Believes that ``our national defense  
rests, in part, on the reliability of our nuclear deterrent'' and 
that ``the long-range goal of the test ban treaty's advocates is 
nuclear disarmament.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. George W. Bush: Opposed treaty. He has said he would  
support a continued voluntary moratorium on testing. Bush said 
ratification would force the United States to conduct foreign 
policy ``with one arm tied behind its back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Dole: Opposed treaty. Urged the Senate to vote it down  
in its current form. ``It is ineffective, not verifiable and, as 
drafted, will not contribute to non-proliferation or national 
security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Forbes: Opposed treaty. Believes treaty would ``compromise  
our national security by undermining the U.S. nuclear deterrent, 
the safety, reliability and effectiveness of which requires 
underground tests on a periodic basis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Orrin Hatch: Opposed treaty, and voted against it in the  
Senate. Said on Senate floor that treaty would ``lower confidence 
in our strategic deterrent while creating an international regime 
that does not guarantee an increase in this country's security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Keyes: Opposed treaty.  
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain: Opposed treaty, and voted against it in the  
Senate. McCain wanted the vote postponed, but felt obligated to 
vote against it when it came to a vote.

<HEADLINE> Kaczynski's Brother Has Film Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCHENECTADY, N.Y. (AP) -- Unabomber Ted Kaczynski's brother has a  
movie deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie will focus on David Kaczynski's decision to turn his  
brother in to authorities in 1996, solving a series of bombings 
that killed three people and injured 22. 
</P>
<P>
	David Kaczynski and his wife, Linda Patrik, will be consultants  
on the film, which will be made by Avnet/Kerner Co. of Los Angeles 
in conjunction with Disney, but they won't be paid for the film 
rights, said Elizabeth Guber Stephen, executive vice president of 
Avnet/Kerner. 
</P>
<P>
	David Kaczynski, an Albany social worker, got a $1 million  
federal reward for turning his brother in. After using some of it 
to pay legal fees and taxes on the reward, he used the rest to set 
up a fund to distribute about $500,000 to victims of crimes 
committed by paranoid schizophrenics. 
</P>
<P>
	Ted Kaczynski denies he has schizophrenia, but expert witnesses  
were prepared to testify that he does. Kaczynski pleaded guilty 
before a trial and was sentenced to life in prison.

<HEADLINE> Coca-Cola Planning New Look </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- In a bid to shake up flat cola sales, Coca-Cola  
Co. may give the packaging for its best-selling soft drink a 
makeover. 
</P>
<P>
	Beverage Digest reports that the new bottles and cans of  
Coca-Cola Classic drop the old slogan ``Always Coca-Cola'' and 
replace it with ``Enjoy Coca-Cola Classic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the new slogan comes new graphics. The labels will show the  
neck of the classic, contoured bottle, but with the cap popped open 
and soda fizzing out, said editor and publisher John Sicher. 
``Coca-Cola'' will be in very large letters, but ``classic'' will 
shrink to small type. 
</P>
<P>
	Customers can expect to see the new look on shelves around Jan.  
1, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there will also be a change in the advertising  
campaign,'' said Sicher. ``I think that `Enjoy' will certainly play 
a role. I don't know whether `Always' will be entirely phased 
out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Coca-Cola Co. will not confirm the report published in the  
Oct. 8 edition of Beverage Digest, an industry publication. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point, we're not going to tip our hand,'' said Coke  
spokesman Bob Bertini. ``We have a number of new initiatives in the 
development stages for the brand Coca-Cola that will be introduced 
next year. We continue to pursue new and innovative ways to make 
our brands more relevant to consumers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new design holds on to Coke's nostalgic image by keeping the  
contoured bottle. But it updates the look for teen-agers, who are 
the largest per capita consumers of soft drinks and have been 
targeted aggressively by other brands, such as Mountain Dew, 
produced by Coke rival Pepsi. 
</P>
<P>
	Caroline Levy, a beverage analyst for Schroder and Co. in New  
York, said she likes the retro design, but said it may not be 
dramatic enough to boost cola sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is very minor,'' said Ms. Levy. ``It seems like a  
subtle change to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coke Classic is the Atlanta-based company's premier product. It  
captures about 20 percent of the soft drink market, making it the 
most popular soft drink in the United States by a wide margin. But 
the brand saw its market share fall in 1997 and only hold steady in 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, citrus-flavored sodas such as Sprite and  
Mountain Dew have surged in popularity. Beverage Digest reported 
that cola sales now account for only 62 percent of the carbonated 
soft drink market -- down from a peak of nearly 72 percent in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, Sicher expects to see Coke and Pepsi -- the other  
major competitor in the cola market -- spend a great deal of money 
on marketing and advertising next year to boost cola sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``Always Coca-Cola'' has been the company's slogan since 1993.  
</P>
<P>
	The new slogan and marketing effort will mark the first major  
changes since Coke's marketing chief, Charles Frenette, took over 
in March 1998. Immediately before ``Always,'' Coke used the line 
``You Can't Beat the Real Thing.''

<HEADLINE> Intel To Buy Wireless Chipmaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Intel Corp. is paying $1.6 billion to buy DSP  
Communications Inc., a maker of microprocessors for mobile phones, 
in a bid to extend its dominance in computer chips to the coming 
boom in wireless devices with Internet access. 
</P>
<P>
	DSP supplies integrated circuits and related system software for  
mobile phone manufacturers based on the wireless technology called 
digital signal processing. 
</P>
<P>
	Its customers include Lucent Technologies, Motorola, NEC, Denso,  
Kyocera, and Sanyo. The company is based in Cupertino, Calif., 
though most of its operations are located in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	For Intel, the deal adds a key technology that's at the very  
heart of the latest rage in the technology and telecommunications 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
	While beepers and other wireless devices with online services  
and e-mail are already available, untethered Internet access has 
emerged as an especially hot theme since the introduction last 
month of Web phone service by Sprint PCS. 
</P>
<P>
	This week's Telecom 99 trade show in Switzerland has been  
largely a frantic dash to unveil new capabilities for the first 
wave of wireless Internet phones, as well as future devices based 
on the next generation of wireless technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, the leading manufacturer of semiconductors for personal  
computers has been moving aggressively to make sure it plays a 
similar role in the development of network and wireless technology, 
areas with far more growth potential than desktop machines. 
</P>
<P>
	So while Intel already makes memory chips for cell phones that  
process and store data such as phone numbers and messages, DSP will 
enable it to also produce the chips that transmit that data between 
a mobile handset and a wireless network. 
</P>
<P>
	``This acquisition is an important element of Intel's plan to  
become the leading building block supplier to the Internet,'' the 
company said in a press release. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig Barrett, president and chief executive of the Santa Clara,  
Calif.-based Intel, added that, ``Cellular technology is emerging 
as a new high-speed method of connecting to the Internet and we 
believe over time will become increasingly important for connecting 
PCs to the Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The all-cash deal announced Thursday values DSP at $36 a share,  
or a premium of more than 25 percent above Wednesday's closing 
stock price of $28 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	DSP shares rose $6.31 1/4 to $34.93 3/4 in trading on the New York  
Stock Exchange. Intel shares rose $1.21 7/8 to $73.34 3/8 in trading on 
the Nasdaq Stock Market.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Nominates NATO Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton nominated Air Force Gen.  
Joseph Ralston on Thursday to be the next chief of NATO, a move 
that requires the job's current occupant to step aside ahead of 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``General Ralston's distinguished career spans three decades,  
with significant operational and policy experience,'' Clinton said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has put the best face on its decision  
to accelerate the replacement of Gen. Wesley Clark as NATO 
commander next year. Although the move exposes rifts in the U.S. 
high command over the prosecution of the war in Kosovo, the 
administration has repeatedly praised Clark and said his early 
departure is a bureaucratic matter. 
</P>
<P>
	``General Clark is doing an extraordinary job as Supreme Allied  
Commander (in) Europe,'' and ``led allied forces to a brilliant 
victory'' in Kosovo, Clinton's statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ralston is now second-in-command at the Joint Chiefs of Staff in  
Washington, and a confidant of Defense Secretary William Cohen. 
Cohen stood by Ralston when his nomination for the top Joint Chiefs 
job sank two years ago over his admission of a long-ago affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Ralston must leave his Pentagon post by early next year, and by  
law he must assume another four-star position within 60 days or 
retire. The time crunch meant that if Ralston was going to get 
Clark's job, he had to have it before Clark's scheduled departure 
in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 10 previous officers to hold the job -- all Americans --  
only three served shorter terms than the two years, 10 months Clark 
will have served by May. One of those, Gen. John Shalikashvili, 
left the post in 1993 because Clinton named him chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton later said he was ``disturbed'' at how his decision to  
appoint Ralston became public in July, and he denied reports that 
he was unhappy with Clark over the general's blunt assessments of 
administration policy in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark argued strenuously to keep open the option of using ground  
troops in Kosovo, although the Pentagon ruled it out. He chafed at 
the graduated air campaign dictated by the 19-member NATO alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	Ralston's nomination will be sent first to the NATO leadership,  
and if approved will go to the Senate for confirmation. Despite the 
old adultery issue, Ralston is not expected to face difficulty in 
the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also announced Thursday that Air Force Gen. Richard B.  
Myers will succeed Ralston as vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs. He 
also announced that Air Force Gen. Ralph E. Eberhart will succeed 
Myers as head of the U.S. Space Command.

<HEADLINE> Many Decline Diet Drug Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- American Home Products Corp.'s proposed  
$3.75 billion settlement for the 6 million people who took the 
fen-phen diet drug combination is great, some lawyers say -- for 
healthy people who just want future medical checkups. 
</P>
<P>
	``For those people who are injured, it stinks,'' said Marc J.  
Bern, a New York City attorney who represents 5,000 people who sued 
American Home for ailments they say were caused by fen-phen. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 8,000 people who have sued the Madison-based company  
over the diet drug combination will opt out of the settlement 
agreement, lawyers say, threatening the resolution of one of the 
nation's largest product-liability cases. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home can terminate the deal in the next six months if  
it decides too many people refuse to participate. The company won't 
say how many that would be. 
</P>
<P>
	Company spokesman Doug Petkus said the deal offered a wide range  
of benefits to everyone who took the drugs and he expected people 
to conclude it was preferable to a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``This agreement was designed for the patients, not the  
lawyers,'' Petkus said. ``We believe that well-informed claimants 
will participate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But some lawyers say the settlement didn't even give their  
clients enough money to pay medical bills. 
</P>
<P>
	The company says it has been sued by 11,000 fen-phen users,  
although some attorneys believe the number is considerably higher. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home made fenfluramine -- the ``fen'' in fen-phen. It  
sold that drug under the brand name Pondimin, along with a similar 
drug called Redux. The two drugs were recalled in 1997 after they 
were linked to heart and lung damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Phentermine, the other half of the fen-phen mix, hasn't been  
linked to problems when taken alone. It is made by another company 
and is still on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	The company announced a nationwide deal last week to settle  
claims that the drug combination caused dangerous heart valve 
problems. The settlement covers any of the 6 million people who 
took the drugs, whether they've sued or not. 
</P>
<P>
	Payments in the settlement would range from $30 to $60 monthly  
prescription refunds to a maximum of $1.5 million for people with 
heart problems. 
</P>
<P>
	But a copy of the settlement agreement obtained by The  
Associated Press limits that maximum payment only to people who 
were 24 or younger when they became ill and who suffer the most 
serious complications from heart valve damage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if there is an individual in the United States  
that would qualify for $1.5 million under this settlement,'' said 
plaintiffs' attorney Bern. 
</P>
<P>
	He said many of his clients were middle-aged women whose medical  
expenses alone were higher than the maximum they could obtain under 
the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston lawyer Tom Pirtle, who represents 3,200 plaintiffs, said  
one of his clients scheduled for trial in January has $2 million in 
medical bills, but would qualify for half that in the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	He has 40 other cases scheduled for trial, and said he could win  
damages more efficiently in the courts than he could from a 
settlement that may take years to win court approval. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've got a proposal,'' Pirtle said. ``I've got a person  
who's set for trial in January, who's not in good health.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bern said that lawyers appointed by a Philadelphia federal judge  
to negotiate a settlement primarily represented less ill clients. 
He praised the settlement for its treatment of healthy people who 
sought only medical monitoring. The company has set aside $1 
billion for checkups and refunds. 
</P>
<P>
	Bern said that at most, 25 percent of the plaintiff's lawyers  
support the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	A plaintiffs' lawyer who helped negotiate the settlement said he  
had the support of 100 lawyers who have filed more than half of the 
lawsuits against American Home. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been through this before,'' said Philadelphia lawyer  
Arnold Levin. ``I hear all these initial comments in the beginning 
and somehow, when a settlement is good, it takes.''

<HEADLINE> Consumers Paying Higher Bank Fees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- People who do not maintain a minimum balance  
in their checking accounts are paying an average $217.32 a year in 
various bank charges, up from $199.79 two years ago, a new survey 
finds. 
</P>
<P>
	And consumers with accounts at big banks are paying on average  
16 percent more for them than customers of smaller banks, the U.S. 
Public Interest Research Group said in its latest annual survey of 
bank fees. 
</P>
<P>
	An official of the American Bankers Association called the  
consumer group's findings ``completely misleading.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Most people figure out a way to reduce the cost'' of a  
checking account, often by having their paychecks deposited 
automatically into their accounts, James Chessen, chief economist 
of the bankers' group, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The consumer group included various fees beyond flat monthly  
service charges in calculating the average annual cost paid by 
checking account customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey comes as Congress edges toward a final vote on  
sweeping legislation that would lift Depression-era legal barriers 
and allow banks, securities firms and insurance companies to merge. 
</P>
<P>
	Many consumer groups, including U.S. PIRG, have opposed the  
legislation, saying it would increase the concentration of 
financial power in a few big corporations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Banks are punishing consumers with a relentless onslaught of  
more and higher fees,'' said Ed Mierzwinski, PIRG's consumer 
program director. ``Worse, many banks are hiding fee increases by 
adding new fees for services that used to come standard with your 
checking account.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the new charges include monthly ATM card fees, canceled  
check fees, and fees for telephoning the bank or closing an 
account. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress will make the problem worse if it approves'' the  
financial overhaul legislation, which would ``make big banks 
bigger,'' Mierzwinski said. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey of 526 banks in 33 states and the District of  
Columbia found that the most expensive states to bank in are New 
York, Florida, Texas, Michigan and North Carolina. The least 
expensive are Nebraska, Missouri, Utah, Colorado and Arkansas, 
according to PIRG, which ranked states on the basis of several cost 
factors -- including monthly fees for checking accounts, minimum 
balance requirements, fees for using automated teller machines, 
bounced check fees and the number of banks offering free checking. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey also found:  
</P>
<P>
	--The average cost to maintain a regular checking account at a  
credit union is $111.59 a year, compared with the $217.32 average 
at banks. 
</P>
<P>
	--Bank customers are paying an average $22.01 penalty for  
bouncing a check, up from $20.53 in 1997; $4.79 for receiving 
someone else's bounced check in your account (called a 
deposit-item-returned fee), down from $4.90 two years ago; and 
$19.19 to stop payment on a check, up from $18.17. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve, in a report to Congress this summer, found  
that ATM fees charged by banks and savings and loans increased 
significantly from 1997 to 1998 as did the number of institutions 
offering free checking. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank also found that in 1998, as in previous years,  
most of the fees charged by big banks operating in several states -- 
including those created by mergers -- were significantly higher than 
those levied by smaller banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has expressed concern over rising  
bank fees in congressional testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	But Chessen, the economist at the American Bankers Association,  
said consumers can keep their banking costs down by shopping 
around. 
</P>
<P>
	``Markets work and consumers are very smart, and they know how  
to get a good deal,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	PIRG's Mierzwinski suggested that consumers usually will find  
the best deals at credit unions or smaller banks. He advised them 
to look for free checking, or free or low-cost checking with direct 
deposit of paychecks. 
</P>
<P>
	The PIRG survey covered banks in Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas,  
California, Colorado, the District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, 
Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, 
Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, 
New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, 
Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, 
Washington and Wisconsin.

<HEADLINE> Doctor Defends Detox Procedure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHERRY HILL, N.J. (AP) -- A doctor who agreed to stop treating  
heroin addicts with a controversial rapid detox procedure linked by 
state investigators to the deaths of six of his patients defended 
the practice Thursday, saying ``I was trying to help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Lance Gooberman reached an agreement Wednesday with the  
state Board of Medical Examiners that temporarily bars him from 
performing the treatment in his clinic in a Philadelphia suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	He is among only a dozen doctors in the country to perform the  
treatment touted as a swift and relatively painless cure for heroin 
addicts who are anesthetized while drugs cleanse their brain of 
heroin. 
</P>
<P>
	The treatment costs $2,900 to $3,600 and is not covered by most  
health insurance plans. 
</P>
<P>
	In a complaint filed earlier this month, the state said the  
treatment is too risky and cited the deaths of six people who 
underwent the procedure. It accused Gooberman and his associate, 
Dr. David Bradway, of serious lapses in medical care and criticized 
their use of the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
	The patients died less than three days after receiving the  
treatment -- known as Ultra Rapid Opiate Detoxification, according 
to the complaint. The deaths occurred between 1995 and last June. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing ultra about ultra detox was the risk to the  
health of the patients,'' Mark Herr, director of the state Division 
of Consumer Affairs, said Thursday. ``This is a treatment that is 
not medically established nor recognized.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state is seeking civil penalties and revocation or  
suspension of both doctors' medical licenses. Their lawyer says she 
will oppose those attempts at an administrative hearing. A date has 
not been set. 
</P>
<P>
	Gooberman estimates he has performed the ultra rapid detox on  
2,300 patients at his Merchantville clinic since 1995 with few 
incidents. His lawyer says there is no evidence the deaths were 
caused by the treatment, and claims at least two deaths were 
related to subsequent cocaine use by the patients. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are thousands of them being performed all over the  
world,'' Gooberman said. ``I was trying to help patients to the 
best of my ability.''

<HEADLINE> Retail Mutual Fund Assets Rise / Money Market Funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Assets of the nation's retail money market  
mutual funds rose by $3.45 billion in the latest week to $908.17 
billion, the Investment Company Institute said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of taxable money market funds in the retail category rose  
by $3.45 billion to $756.22 billion for the week ended Wednesday, 
the Washington-based mutual fund trade group said. Tax-exempt fund 
assets rose by $6.8 million to $151.94 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of institutional money market funds rose by $6.85 billion  
to $623.15 billion for the same period. Among institutional funds, 
taxable money market fund assets rose by $7.29 billion to $575.19 
billion; assets of tax-exempt funds fell by $445.9 million to 
$47.97 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Total money market assets stood at $1.531 trillion for the week.  
</P>
<P>
	Assets for the previous week were revised to $1.521 trillion to  
reflect reporting errors and a change in the number of funds 
reporting. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds was  
4.74 percent for the week ended Tuesday, unchanged from the 
previous week, said IBC's Money Fund Report, a trade journal 
published in Ashland, Mass., by IBC Financial Data Inc. The 30-day 
average yield rose to 4.72 percent from 4.70 percent, IBC Financial 
Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day compounded yield held steady at 4.85 percent, and  
the 30-day compounded yield rose to 4.83 percent from 4.81 percent, 
IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was  
57 days, unchanged from a week earlier, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The online service bankrate.com said its survey of 100 leading  
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks 
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the annual percentage 
yield available on money market accounts was 2.08 percent as of 
Wednesday unchanged from a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based unit of Intelligent Life Corp.  
said the annual percentage yield available on interest-bearing 
checking accounts held steady at 0.84 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Bankrate.com said the annual percentage yield was 4.42 percent  
on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 4.40 percent the 
previous week. Yields were 4.81 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 4.75 
percent; 5.06 percent on 2 1/2-year CDs, up from 5.03 percent; and 
5.31 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 5.27 percent.

<HEADLINE> Israel Begins Releasing Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASHKELON, Israel (AP) -- Buses pulled away from an Israeli jail  
at daybreak Friday, signaling the start of the release of 151 
Palestinian prisoners from Israeli lockups, part of an interim 
peace accord signed Sept. 4. 
</P>
<P>
	The prisoners are to be driven to five points in the West Bank  
and Gaza Strip and then released. Israeli officials said 83 will be 
taken to Gaza, including 37 citizens of Arab countries, jailed for 
attacking Israelis or for crossing the border illegally. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel released a first group of 199 prisoners on Sept. 9. The  
second release was held up for a week by a disagreement over which 
prisoners were to be freed. 
</P>
<P>
	Palestinians planned emotional welcoming ceremonies for  
relatives considered freedom fighters who struggled against Israeli 
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Many Israelis regard 
the prisoners as terrorists who planned, aided or carried out 
bloody attacks against Israeli civilians and soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel refuses to free Palestinians who killed Israelis or who  
were arrested for attacking Israelis after Israel and the 
Palestinians began signing interim peace accords in 1993. Israel 
has also balked at releasing militants opposed to peace, but 
Palestinians say several in Friday's group belong to Hamas and the 
Islamic Jihad. 
</P>
<P>
	The prisoner release, and plans Sunday for the opening of a safe  
passage route for Palestinians through Israel, appears to put peace 
steps back on track. The two sides however have yet to resume 
negotiations on a final peace treaty, another element of the Sept. 
4 accord.

<HEADLINE> Purdue Facing Top Rushing Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) -- Undefeated fifth-ranked Michigan  
State has the nation's top rushing defense, and No. 20 Purdue hopes 
to attack it with redshirt freshman Montrell Lowe as he makes his 
second collegiate start. 
</P>
<P>
	If the 5-foot-9, 190-pound Lowe can duplicate his first start,  
the Boilermakers might spring an upset in the Homecoming Game on 
Saturday. Lowe raced, powered and cut his way to 153 yards against 
Ohio State last Saturday. He had a 5-yard touchdown run in the 
25-22 loss, averaging 6.1 yards per carry. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State (6-0 overall, 3-0 Big Ten) wasn't even ranked in  
the preseason poll. But the Spartans have put themselves in 
contention for a conference title with a defense that has allowed 
36.7 yards a game rushing and only one rushing touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Nick Saban's challenge becomes tougher with the switch to  
Lowe from J. Crabtree, who led the team in rushing last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have a great offense in Drew Brees, some very good  
athletes all over the field. I think Montrell Lowe has given them 
another dimension,'' Saban said. ``He's an outstanding running 
back. They've got some very good pass receivers in Chris Daniels 
and Vinny Sutherland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue (4-2, 1-2) has dropped consecutive games at Ohio State  
and Michigan, which lost to Michigan State last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be important for our players to do the little  
things right and pay attention to detail,'' said Saban, who has 
seen his team drop consecutive one-point decisions to the 
Boilermakers with dramatic comebacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue coach Joe Tiller knows it will be difficult to run  
against the Spartans. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are a very good run-stop defense,'' he said. ``Certainly  
everyone is going to push the ball at them, if they can. We'll try 
to do what we did most effectively last week, which was try to run 
some out of our shotgun formation. ... Pull the ball down and run 
with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What Lowe lacks in size, he makes up for in strength. He has  
benchpressed 375 pounds and squats 565. 
</P>
<P>
	``Montrell is a good, quick back,'' Tiller said. ``The thing  
that is deceptive about him is not necessarily his quickness, but 
his strength. ... He's packed pretty good, and as a result he 
breaks tackles. You usually don't get a real good shot at him. ... 
He's beginning to mature as a back and the old infamous cliche, his 
future is ahead of him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Michigan State's defense also will need to prevent  
Brees from having a big day. The junior leads the Big Ten with an 
average of 302.2 yards per game passing, having completed 
151-of-260 attempts for 1,813 yards and 11 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniels remains his most productive receiver with 57 catches for  
562 yards. His averages of 97.2 yards receiving and 9.2 catches per 
game are the third highest in the nation. In his career, the senior 
has 1,171 yards receiving and needs just 24 more to move past Leroy 
Keyes into Purdue's top 20.

<HEADLINE> Last U.S. Budget Deadlock Settled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- State House and Senate leaders have agreed on the  
basics of a compromise budget, a deal that will bring an end to the 
three-month old budget deadlock -- the longest in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Massachusetts was the last state in the country without a  
budget. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed budget for the fiscal year that should have begun  
July 1 will include tax cuts, prescription drug relief for the 
elderly, aid to schools and financing changes for Boston's public 
transportation agency. 
</P>
<P>
	State government has been running on monthly temporary budgets  
since the July 1 deadline passed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a win for the people. Unfortunately it took this long,''  
said Rep. Michael Ruane of Salem. ``It's a classic case of give and 
take.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until last week, Massachusetts wasn't the only state to have a  
budget deadlock. But Wisconsin's logjam broke, leaving 
Massachusetts alone without a budget. 
</P>
<P>
	And it's really not quite over: Details of the budget must now  
be hammered out by the conference committee and then the bill goes 
to the full Legislature. It could take two weeks before it's placed 
on the desk of Gov. Paul Cellucci to be signed into law.

<HEADLINE> Aerospace Firms To Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- DASA AG, the German aerospace unit of  
DaimlerChrysler AG, plans to merge with France's Aerospatiale Matra 
S.A. to create Europe's biggest aerospace company and the 
third-largest in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced today comes amid a wave of consolidation in  
Europe's aerospace industry which is trying to remain competitive 
against the industry's two biggest manufacturers, Boeing Co. and 
Lockheed Martin Corp. of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	European companies already cooperate in building Airbus  
passenger jets and military jets like the Eurofighter and Tornado. 
But industry insiders fear that unless they pool their skills, 
finances and research more closely, they will be acquired by U.S. 
companies eager to expand into European markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be the driving force in the aerospace sector just as  
we are in the automotive industry,'' DaimlerChrysler co-chairman 
Juergen Schrempp said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	In a sign of the importance European leaders place on the deal,  
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and French Prime Minister 
Lionel Jospin attended the signing ceremony in Strasbourg, adding 
their signatures as witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Both leaders heralded the merger as a critical and natural step  
as European institutions become more tightly entwined. 
</P>
<P>
	``European integration is going forward in many areas --  
employment, the euro, foreign and security policies,'' Jospin said. 
``It is not possible that an industry in such an important sector 
is left behind. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today's sucess shows that German-French cooperation is the  
inexhaustible motor for European unity,'' the French leader said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder echoed the theme, saying the merger ``is expression  
for the fact that our two countries wish to face the challenges of 
the future together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the heart of the merger between the two roughly equal  
companies lie their hefty stakes in Airbus Industrie, the No. 2 
civilian aircraft maker after Boeing. 
</P>
<P>
	Including the tiny Spanish aerospace company CASA, which is  
currently being merged with DASA, the new firm will have an 80 
percent stake in Airbus. The remaining 20 percent is held by the 
fourth partner, British Aerospace, which welcomed the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the deal should help push forward protracted  
discussions on transforming the Airbus consortium into a private 
company, now that the Germans and French will presumably be acting 
as one. 
</P>
<P>
	But difficult issues such as agreeing on the value of Airbus  
assets to be pooled, management structure and how to deal with the 
loss of its tax-free status remain. 
</P>
<P>
	The merged German-French firm, to be called European Aeronautic,  
Defense and Space Co. (EADS), also will make helicopters through 
Eurocopter, operate the Ariane satellite launching system and 
provide satellites, military aircraft and defense systems. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler expects to get the necessary regulatory approval  
to allow the new aerospace company to begin operating in the first 
half of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler will own 30 percent of the new company while the  
French Lagardere Group and the French government, which control 
Aerospatiale Matra, will own another combined 30 percent. The 
remaining 40 percent will be sold on the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	Jospin's office said ownership of the French stake will be  
divided with 50 percent held by the state, 37 percent by Lagardere 
and the rest by unnamed French investors. The French government 
plans to reduce its stake later to 15 percent through a secondary 
share offering, DaimlerChrysler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both DaimlerChrysler and Lagardere and partner British Aerospace  
called the creation of EADS a big step toward converting Airbus 
into a ``truly integrated'' private company. Lagardere said that 
British Aerospace has been asked to join the future Airbus. 
</P>
<P>
	``The merger is a very helpful step towards the creation of the  
Airbus single corporate entity,'' British Aerospace said. 
</P>
<P>
	The three companies have said they were reviewing the  
possibility of two pooling their Airbus stake into a holding 
company, while the third partner would join at a later stage. 
</P>
<P>
	Aerospatiale Matra's own merger earlier this year was seen as  
aiding the transformation process by reducing the French 
government's stake in the French partner to less than half, 48 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler spokesman Eckhard Zanger declined to elaborate  
on the plans for Airbus. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing is the world's largest aerospace company with annual  
revenue of $64 billion followed by Lockheed Martin with $26.8 
billion. DaimlerChrysler said the new firm EADS would have combined 
revenue of $22.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	It will have 89,000 employees and dual headquarters in Paris and  
Munich, where DASA is based.

<HEADLINE> House Panel Investigates Gifts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional investigators say they will step  
up their investigation of a Chinese government-owned conglomerate 
after two Chinese Embassy officials visited Capitol Hill to urge an 
end to the inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Government Reform Committee is investigating whether a  
Phoenix-based subsidiary of the company made improper gifts to 
Charles Parish, a former State Department officer in charge of 
issuing visas at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing from 1994 to 1996. Two 
officials in the Chinese Embassy's commercial office visited 
committee investigators last month to discuss the probe, an 
offshoot of an investigation into illegal campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main thing the people at the Chinese Embassy accomplished  
by visiting us was to raise our antennae and make us wonder why 
they visited,'' said Kevin Binger, the committee's Republican staff 
director. ``I think they hoped they could come in and squelch that 
part of our investigation, but in reality they just made us all the 
more interested.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A July panel report alleged that Elizabeth Mann, who heads BNU,  
the Phoenix-based subsidiary of the Chinese company called COFCO, 
gave gifts and free luxury lodging to Parish ``as a way of ensuring 
that COFCO officials received visas.'' COFCO is the China National 
Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Import and Export Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee recently subpoenaed BNU and Mann, seeking more  
documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Mann, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in China, has denied  
wrongdoing. BNU owns a $90 million Chinese cultural center in 
Phoenix, manages real estate in the West, makes automobile loans 
and imports shoes from factories in China. 
</P>
<P>
	Parish, who also has denied wrongdoing, retired from the State  
Department after an internal probe cleared him of criminal 
misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Late last month, two Chinese Embassy officials asked to meet  
with committee Chairman Dan Burton, R-Ind., and were referred to 
two investigators. The officials -- Shi Jianxin, head of the 
embassy's commercial affairs office, and Ci Bin, first secretary of 
that office -- told investigators the probe risked harming relations 
with China and COFCO, a major grain importer, Binger said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've worked on Capitol Hill for 15 years, and I've never heard  
of a diplomat coming in and trying to squelch a congressional 
investigation,'' Binger said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ci disputed Binger's characterization of the Sept. 23 meeting,  
which was first reported by The Arizona Republic last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We talked friendly. Then someone says it's illegal, improper?  
No, it wasn't,'' Ci said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Embassy officials of all countries often work to help their  
citizens and companies, but sending such officials to the House 
committee to discuss the investigation seems ``a little odd,'' said 
Bates Gill, a China expert at the Brookings Institution. 
</P>
<P>
	``They knew that going up there in this environment would not be  
easy,'' Gill said. ``They must have made the decision that it was 
important enough to try anyway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The committee began looking into Mann and BNU in connection with  
its probe of illegal campaign fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Democratic fund-raiser Johnny Chung told the committee in  
May that Parish helped get visas for Chung's associates, and an 
executive of a Chinese beer company asked Chung to give Parish ``a 
shopping bag of money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The committee's July report said Jianwei ``Jay'' Ding, a former  
BNU executive, told the panel that Mann gave Parish several gifts 
and let him stay for free at company-owned condominiums in 
California and Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just wanted him (Parish) to visit our company, that's it,''  
Mann told The Republic earlier this year. Her lawyer, Charles 
Conroy, said in July that the panel's report was ``filled with 
inaccuracies'' and that COFCO and BNU ``would have no reason 
whatsoever to obtain visas ... other than through completely legal 
channels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calls to Mann for comment this week were referred first to  
Conroy's New York office, and from there to attorney Joe Linklater 
in Chicago, who did not respond to four telephone messages. 
</P>
<P>
	Parish declined to testify to the House committee in July,  
citing his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	Binger said Ci and Shi, in their visit with committee  
investigators, portrayed Ding as a disgruntled former employee who 
had stolen from COFCO, drove two luxury cars and lived in an 
expensive house. 
</P>
<P>
	Ding's lawyer, Richard Neuheisel, said Ding did not steal from  
BNU and has not found steady work since being fired in 1996 after 
challenging a proposed real estate deal engineered by Mann. Ding 
lives in a shabby two-bedroom apartment, drives a Toyota Corolla 
and delivers newspapers for a living, Neuheisel said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guy's on poverty row. It's hand to mouth,'' Neuheisel  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ding, a Chinese citizen, has applied for political asylum,  
saying he fears he could be jailed, tortured or killed if he 
returns to China. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the fact that we've had people from the embassy make a  
special trip up here just to talk about Jay Ding makes us concerned 
about his safety,'' Binger said.

<HEADLINE> Detroits's Lieberman-Cline Returns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Detroit Shock coach Nancy Lieberman-Cline will be  
back for a third season after the team exercised its option in the 
final year of her contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Lieberman-Cline, also the general manager, accepted the option,  
Shock spokesman Dennis Sampier said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	She led the team to a playoff berth in its second WNBA season  
after finishing 15-17. Her two-year record is 32-30. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have enjoyed my first two years here in Detroit and I am  
thrilled and happy to be back for a third,'' Lieberman-Cline said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	But her second season was rocky. At one game, she was booed by  
fans after trading two popular players, Korie Hlede and Cindy 
Brown, to Utah. Attendance and local television ratings dropped 
from the 1998 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Lieberman-Cline, nicknamed ``Lady Magic,'' was enshrined in the  
Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1996 after a storied 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	Lieberman-Cline, who led Old Dominion to two national collegiate  
championships, became the youngest basketball player to win an 
Olympic medal at 18 -- a silver in the 1976 Games at Montreal. She 
also led the Dallas Diamonds of the Women's Basketball League to 
the 1981 championship. 
</P>
<P>
	She was the first woman to play in a men's professional league --  
with the USBL's Springfield Fame and Long Island Knights -- and 
played for the Phoenix Mercury in the WNBA's inaugural season.

<HEADLINE> AP Corrects Gold-Bugs-Burned Story </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The Associated Press reported erroneously  
Thursday, Oct. 7, that the Australian gold mining company Sons of 
Gwalia Ltd. would likely face severe losses due to futures 
contracts it bought as a hedge against the fluctuating value of its 
gold reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP story said the contracts would require the company to  
sell gold at below-market prices, possibly buying gold at 
disadvantageous rates to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Sons of Gwalia has the option of not delivering on 75  
percent of these futures contracts. The remaining 25 percent were 
fixed at prices that are above the current spot price for gold, so 
honoring them presents no disadvantage to the company.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Chides GOP on Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton demanded today that  
congressional Republicans ``put an end to reckless partisanship, to 
gimmicks and gamesmanship'' and work with him to shape a federal 
budget both can accept. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can work for a season of promise, not a winter of  
politics,'' Clinton told an hour-long White House news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	He complained that with only a week to go before the expiration  
of the stopgap spending resolution that is financing much of the 
government, ``Congress is not even close to finishing its work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he wants a responsible budget that will save Social  
Security, strengthen Medicare, pay down the national debt and 
provide adequate funds for education, crime control, the 
environment and his other priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was willing to compromise to that end.  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton began with a statement denouncing Senate Republicans for  
voting down the nuclear test ban treaty on Wednesday, accusing them 
of ``partisan politics of the worst kind'' and of a new 
isolationism. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., in a news conference  
that followed the president's, insisted that politics did not play 
a role in the Senate's rejection of the treaty. ``Some of the most 
thoughtful senators that ever served in this body'' agreed that 
compliance by other nations could not be adequately verified, Lott 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a flawed treaty,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he will proceed according to the terms of the  
treaty despite the Senate action. ``I have no intention of doing 
anything other than sticking with the obligations imposed by the 
treaty on the United States,'' said Clinton. The United States has 
not conducted tests since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``I signed that treaty, it still binds us, unless I go and erase  
our name,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	On other points, Clinton:  
</P>
<P>
	--Said he hopes that the military coup leaders who took over the  
government in Pakistan will soon yield to civilian control. ``And I 
would hope that nothing would be done at this time to aggravate 
tensions between India and Pakistan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Avoided criticism of Bill Bradley, the candidate challenging  
Vice President Al Gore for the Democratic presidential nomination, 
saying: ``I am not a candidate in the Democratic primary.'' He said 
Gore is the best vice president in history. ``I expect him to win 
but I expect to support the nominee of my party as I always have,'' 
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore has questioned Bradley's Democratic loyalty because the  
former New Jersey senator once spoke of possibly campaigning for 
president as an independent. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said that he would serve no useful function by talking  
about that. ``I am not going to get into horse racing,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The questioning turned repeatedly to the nuclear test ban  
rejection and its impact abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Chinese should have every assurance that as long as this  
administration is here, we support'' the ban on nuclear tests, 
Clinton said. ``Now, if we ever get a president that's against the 
test ban treaty, which we may get -- I mean there are plenty of 
people out there who say they are against it -- then I think you 
might as well get ready for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You'll have Russia testing, you'll have China testing, you'll  
have India testing, you'll have Pakistan testing, you'll have 
countries abandoning the nonproliferation treaty,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican presidential front-runner,  
opposes the test ban treaty, but has said he would continue the 
voluntary moratorium on testing. Other GOP presidential candidates 
also are against the treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was asked what he thinks the American people will be  
looking for in a president in the next election. ``What I think 
they will be looking for is someone who will offer big ideas,'' he 
said, on the aging of America, the growing number of children, gun 
limits to make the country safer, steps against poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope they will say that they don't want America to adopt a  
new isolationism, they want us to lead into the future,'' Clinton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about missile defense systems and their impact on the  
existing anti-ballistic missile treaty with Russia, he said the 
responsible step would be to go ahead with a U.S. system if a 
workable one is developed. He said it would be foolish to discard 
the ABM treaty, which would bar that, but said the United States 
should work with Moscow on possible changes. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton declined to answer a question about his reaction to the  
decision of a federal judge that he lied under oath in the sex 
harassment case brought against him by Paula Jones, which triggered 
the Monica Lewinsky scandal. ``When I am out of office, I will have 
a lot to say about this,'' Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Indians Coach Regan Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Phil Regan resigned as Indians pitching coach  
Thursday, three days after Cleveland's collapse in the first round 
of the AL playoffs against the Boston Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	The 62-year-old Regan was in his second stint with the Indians  
after serving as pitching coach in 1994. He left Cleveland 
following that season to manage the Baltimore Orioles in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland held an option for 2000 on Regan but declined to pick  
it up by Oct. 1. The team could still have rehired him for next 
season, but he decided to leave the team instead. 
</P>
<P>
	Indians media relations director Bart Swain said he did not know  
if Regan would pursue another job in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
	Regan was hired last October after the Indians reassigned  
pitching coach Mark Wiley, who spent this past season with the 
Kansas City Royals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians hoped Regan would quicken the development of  
youngsters Bartolo Colon and Jaret Wright. 
</P>
<P>
	Colon had an outstanding season, posting an 18-5 mark with a  
3.95 ERA. Wright, however, went 8-10 with a 6.06 ERA and pitched in 
relief against the Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	His year also included two stints on the disabled list and a  
controversial meeting with AL president Gene Budig amid accusations 
he was throwing at hitters. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland's pitching fell apart against Boston as the Red Sox  
scored 44 runs in the final three games to overcome an 0-2 deficit 
and advance to the ALCS against the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians' pitching staff was ravaged by injuries all year,  
with Wright, Steve Karsay, Steve Reed, Ricardo Rincon and Paul 
Shuey among the pitchers who spent time on the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	Regan's departure could be the first of several for the Indians  
this winter. Cleveland general manager John Hart said earlier this 
week that the club would be examining ways to improve, and would be 
reviewing manager Mike Hargrove's status. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove has drawn harsh criticism for some of his decisions  
during the Red Sox series. Hargrove, who has managed the Indians 
for nine seasons, is signed for 2000 with a club option for 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have had no discussions about the manager,'' Hart said.  
``No decision has been made. We're going to need time.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mixed; Dow Up 45.59 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks turned higher in volatile  
trading today as soaring bond yields and strong corporate earnings 
prevented investors from choosing any clear course. 
</P>
<P>
	In mid-afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones  
industrial average was up 45.59 at 10,277.75. The Dow had been 
lower for much of the morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were slightly lower. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index was down 2.58 at 1,282.97, and the Nasdaq 
composite index was down 4.86 at 2,796.41. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks initially fell today after the Commerce Department issued  
what appeared to be a moderate report on September retail sales. 
Total retail sales rose to a seasonally adjusted $253.4 billion, a 
gain of just 0.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But excluding the volatile automobile category, retail sales  
rose a brisk 0.6 percent in September. Many analysts were expecting 
a 0.5 percent gain. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, the Labor Department said the number of  
Americans filing for unemployment benefits last week fell by an 
unexpected 29,000 to 285,000. Economists believe that jobless 
claims levels under 300,000 are an indication of an extremely tight 
labor market. 
</P>
<P>
	Both reports heightened fears that the Federal Reserve will  
raise interest rates for the third time this year in an effort to 
keep inflation from escalating. The Fed's Open Market Committee 
will hold its next meeting on Nov. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Fears of inflation sent the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond  
soaring to 6.32 percent, its highest level since Oct. 1997. Bond 
yields above 6.25 percent are viewed as a very appealing 
alternative to stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	But while some investors moved away from stocks in favor of  
bonds, a handful of robust earnings reports sparked renewed buying. 
After releasing earnings that beat analysts' expectations, Apple 
soared 7 19/32 to 71 5/8, helping to contain the losses of the 
technology-dominated Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow's strength came largely from Boeing. Shares rose 3 7/16  
to 43 15/16 after the company said third-quarter profits rose 37 
percent as its commercial aircraft division continued to recover 
from costly production problems. Boeing earned 52 cents per share 
in the quarter, beating analysts' estimates by 3 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	But General Motors slipped 3/4 to 64 3/8 after reporting earnings of  
$1.33 a share, compared with analysts' prediction of $1.24 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	And investors continued their pattern of punishing companies for  
any measure of bad news. Unisys plunged 15 15/16 to 26 5/16 after 
announcing that earnings increased 72 percent from the third 
quarter of 1998, but revenues grew just 4 percent, below the 8 
percent anticipated by analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	Gail Dudack, chief equity strategist at Warburg Dillon Read,  
said scattered reports of earnings weakness have pushed investors 
back into the pessimism that drove stocks lower in late September 
and early October, preventing the market from building on last 
week's solid gains. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought the oversold rebound would continue this week as  
earnings season begins,'' she said. ``Instead, inflation fears and 
disappointing earnings results put the market into a tailspin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Traders suggested that the market's volatility was sparked by  
the promise of a ``double witching'' day on Friday. Quarterly stock 
and index options expire, forcing traders to adjust their 
portfolios. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 608.94 million 
shares, slightly ahead of Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 0.22 to 419.10.

<HEADLINE> Does Hope Beat Experience in Senate? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Once again, it's time for the idea whose time  
never seems to come, as the Senate debates campaign finance reform 
toward a familiar Republican roadblock. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with a stripped-down bill and an invitation to amendments  
aimed at recruiting wavering Republicans, odds are that the annual 
filibuster against restricting political contributions will stop it 
short of a vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The House passed a more stringent campaign finance bill 252-177,  
a margin wider than the real lines on the issue, because a vote for 
reform was the politically practical vote once it was evident that 
the measure would gain a majority -- and probably be shelved in the 
Senate anyhow. 
</P>
<P>
	Sponsors of the measure dropped a threat to snarl Senate  
proceedings last summer in exchange for a deal that has just come 
due, for at least three days of debate and action on amendments. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange, the sponsors agreed to a single vote on ending the  
filibuster promised by Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, 
the perennial and formidable foe of campaign finance limits. That 
would take 60 votes, eight more than they've mustered before. The 
guessing now is they might gain a few, perhaps get to 55, still 
five short. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, that would be it for 1999.  
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain of Arizona, the chief Republican sponsor and a  
candidate for the GOP presidential nomination, and his co-author, 
Democratic Sen. Russell Feingold of Wisconsin, have trimmed their 
bill to one central target: So-called soft money, the unlimited 
donations political parties can accept, ostensibly for such 
purposes as get-out-the-vote efforts, actually used to campaign for 
their candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Those donations offer a barely camouflaged way around the $1,000  
ceiling on individual donations directly to candidates, and around 
the law by which the presidential nominees are restricted to using 
federal campaign money, an estimated $66 million each in 2000, 
unless they decline it outright. 
</P>
<P>
	Soft money is coming in at a record rate this year, nearly $31  
million to the Republicans, more than $26 million to the Democrats 
during the first half of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Opening the Senate debate, McCain said the use of it ``is  
nothing less than an elaborate influence-peddling scheme in which 
both parties conspire to stay in office by selling the country to 
the highest bidder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``All of us are tainted by this system, myself included,''  
McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	The House bill, and earlier versions of the Senate proposal,  
also would restrict what are called issue ads, campaign commercials 
paid for by interest groups, which avoid contribution limits 
because they do not directly advocate the election or defeat or a 
candidate. Those often are attack ads, denouncing a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Past proposals sought more -- curbs on political action  
committees, which are another, more limited way around the 
candidate limits, since they can give a candidate up to $5,000; and 
incentives for candidates who agree to limit their campaign 
spending. Congress tried to do that 25 years ago, but the Supreme 
Court overturned the spending limits as an intrusion on the 
constitutional right of free speech. In a 1976 decision, the court 
said contributions could be limited because the fact or appearance 
of corruption stemming from large donations was ``constitutionally 
sufficient justification'' for restricting them. 
</P>
<P>
	So contribution limits passed in 1974 are still in effect. An  
attempt to raise the individual contribution limit to $3,000, to 
make up for 25 years of inflation, was rejected in the House, and 
probably will be proposed again in the Senate. Reformers are 
divided on that, but McCain has indicated he wouldn't object if it 
would gain allies against the filibuster. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the Supreme Court is considering a case that  
could undo the whole system of contribution limits. At issue is a 
$1,075 limit on individual contributions to candidates for state 
office in Missouri. The limit was overturned by a federal appeals 
court. The Supreme Court is expected to decide by June whether to 
reinstate the Missouri limit. To uphold the appeals court ruling 
that the Missouri contribution limit violates free speech rights 
would effectively erase the federal limits, too. 
</P>
<P>
	McConnell argues that a soft money ban would infringe on free  
speech. McCain says that to the contrary, it would save political 
speech by closing ``the most politically pernicious loophole in 
campaign finance law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But this is not a constitutional debate. It is a political one.  
</P>
<P>
	McConnell calls the bill ``a dagger at the heart'' of the  
Republican Party, taking away a GOP advantage while leaving the 
Democrats the benefit of labor union campaign money. GOP Sen. Orrin 
Hatch of Utah said would amount to ``the unilateral disarmament'' 
of the Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	And they control the Senate.  
</P>

<HEADLINE> Profile of JonBenet Prosecutor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- Shortly after JonBenet Ramsey's body was  
found, District Attorney Alex Hunter stared into TV cameras and 
declared: ``The list of suspect narrows. Soon there will be no one 
on the list but you. 
</P>
<P>
	``You will pay for what you did.''  
</P>
<P>
	In the nearly three years since, Hunter found himself unable to  
back up the threat. Instead he became the target of criticism from 
several angles and was at odds with police as the investigation 
waxed and waned. 
</P>
<P>
	Lead police investigator Steve Thomas resigned in August 1998,  
accusing Hunter of mishandling the case and trying to protect 
JonBenet's parents, millionaire businessman John Ramsey and his 
wife, Patsy. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas contended Hunter's staff shared physical evidence and  
reports with Ramsey attorneys and said evidence remained untested 
in a lab because police and prosecutors were arguing over how to 
proceed. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, consulting homicide investigator Lou Smit resigned. He  
took the opposite side, insisting there was credible evidence of an 
intruder and that the Ramseys were innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas and another former detective also accused Hunter of  
leaking information to a tabloid reporter and urging him to help 
discredit Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
	Through all the turmoil, Hunter, who has been in office since  
1973, said he was no less determined to find the killer of the 
6-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had some interesting cases, some wins and some losses,  
and this case, you all know, has been a very difficult one, and my 
faith in the process has never been shaken,'' he said recently. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Hunter announced that a county grand jury had  
concluded its investigation and that no charges would be filed. He 
said there wasn't enough evidence to indict anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter, 63, was born in the New York City area. He attended the  
University of Colorado law school, where he met his chief deputy, 
Bill Wise. Hunter won top awards in moot court competitions and 
made Law Review. 
</P>
<P>
	After graduation, he clerked for the Colorado Supreme Court's  
chief justice before becoming a part-time deputy district attorney 
in Boulder County in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter formed a law partnership with Wise and another attorney  
two years later, but resigned in 1972 to run for district attorney. 
He defeated the incumbent and has won re-election ever since, most 
recently the month before JonBenet died. Hunter is up for 
re-election next year and has not said whether he would seek 
another term. 
</P>
<P>
	Some residents and attorneys who know Hunter worried about the  
Ramsey case because he has shown a reluctance to go after 
high-profile suspects. Others say he fits right in with 
laissez-faire attitudes in Boulder, a liberal college town. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the most liberal and timid district attorney in  
Colorado,'' said former Denver prosecutor Craig Silverman. ``That 
serves him well in Boulder where they like liberal politicians.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Denver legal analyst Andrew Cohen said Hunter is well-liked by  
many in Boulder and has a reputation for ``being a realist who is 
not afraid to cut a deal when he's getting a good deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He doesn't have the reputation of someone who charges blindly  
up a hill, hoping he's going to find a judge and jury favorable to 
his case,'' Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Hunter's harshest critics is June Menger, the mother of  
University of Colorado student Sid Wells, who was killed in his 
condominium 15 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Police arrested a roommate, Thayne Smika, two months later, but  
Hunter and his staff concluded there wasn't enough evidence to 
press charges, so Smika was released. The case drew attention in 
part because Wells, 22, was dating the daughter of film star Robert 
Redford. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter recently sought another arrest warrant for Smika, but  
police have been unable to locate him.

<HEADLINE> 10 Pct. of U.S. Households Hungry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- New Mexico leads the nation in the  
percentage of people living in hunger, the United States Department 
of Agriculture said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 10 percent of households in 18 states and the District  
of Columbia are going hungry or lack consistent access to adequate 
food, the USDA reported. And New Mexico had the largest percentage 
-- 15.1 -- of households either hungry or threatened with hunger from 
1996 to 1998, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mississippi, Texas, Arizona, Louisiana, Arkansas and Oregon had  
rates of 12.6 percent or higher. 
</P>
<P>
	``During this, the most prosperous economy in decades, it should  
shock most Americans to learn that hunger persists and it is in 
every state,'' said Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman. 
</P>
<P>
	The fact that New Mexico led the country didn't surprise Ann  
Bock, a consumer specialist at New Mexico State University.

<P>
	``We have a very low per-capita income. We have a large migrant  
population that comes into the state and works and often brings 
family,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers from Mexico often don't understand help is available,  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are people that because of their background are not  
going to ask,'' Ms. Bock said. ``It's very difficult to get this 
kind of help if you don't have money and you don't speak the same 
language as the people who can help you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New Mexico's McKinley County, which includes large areas of the  
Navajo and Zuni Indian reservations, has led the state in food 
stamp use. Census figures indicate 15,510 of the county's estimated 
67,558 residents, or 23 percent, were food stamp recipients last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We get at least four people a day come in looking for food for  
their family,'' said Toni Lopez, a supervisor for Catholic 
Charities in Gallup, McKinley County's hub. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very big,'' she said of the hunger problem. ``I would say  
my clientele is 95 percent Native American.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., said he found the USDA report  
troubling. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that food stamp rolls in New Mexico have decreased  
from about 85,000 in 1996 to 64,600 today indicates that the state 
of New Mexico's job of ensuring that families receive help with 
buying food even after they leave welfare is inadequate and must be 
improved. We shouldn't be in this position,'' Domenici said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, 9.7 percent of households were considered ``food  
insecure'' during the three-year period, according to USDA, which 
based its conclusions on annual household surveys conducted by the 
U.S. Census Bureau.

<HEADLINE> Four Added to U.N. Security Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The U.N. General Assembly selected five  
new members for non-permanent seats on the Security Council on 
Thursday, giving Mali, Tunisia, Jamaica, Bangladesh and Ukraine 
two-year terms on the most powerful U.N. decision-making body. 
</P>
<P>
	The five will replace Bahrain, Brazil, Gabon, Gambia and  
Slovenia, whose terms expire Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	There was only one contested race for a seat going into the  
vote, with Ukraine and Slovakia vying for the single seat to 
represent Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	It took four rounds of balloting for Ukraine to secure the  
required two-thirds majority. 
</P>
<P>
	Slovak Ambassador Peter Tomka withdrew his country's candidacy  
after the third round, when Ukraine came within a vote of the 
necessary 114 ballots, but a fourth round was required to make it 
official. 
</P>
<P>
	The other four council seats were all but decided weeks ago when  
Mali, Tunisia, Jamaica and Bangladesh won endorsements from their 
regional groups. 
</P>
<P>
	The Security Council is the most powerful organ of the United  
Nations, and its 15 members are responsible primarily for 
maintaining international peace and security. 
</P>
<P>
	The council alone has the power to make decisions that,  
according to the U.N. Charter, all 188 member states must accept. 
Those decisions include imposing sanctions and authorizing military 
force. 
</P>
<P>
	Five council seats are held permanently by the United States,  
Britain, France, China and Russia, and each of these countries has 
veto power over council decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Each year, five of the 10 non-permanent seats come up for  
election to a two-year term.

<HEADLINE> Bernie Williams Tortures Red Sox </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Of course it had to happen this way: The player  
the Boston Red Sox nearly snatched away from the New York Yankees 
came back to beat them in the AL championship series opener. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees have spent the better part of the century torturing  
the Red Sox. Bernie Williams is only the latest Torquemada. 
</P>
<P>
	Even now, Red Sox fans can dwell back to those hours last  
November, when it seemed like Williams would bolt the Bronx to make 
Fenway Park home. Even Williams has admitted he almost accepted the 
offer from Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette, swayed by the 
entreaties from manager Jimy Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would say very close,'' Bernie said following his  
10th-inning homer off Rod Beck, which gave the Yankees a 4-3 win 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a lot of conversations with my agent and Mr. Duquette  
and Mr. Williams, and I have nothing but good things to say about 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Well, there weren't many nice things said about Bernie Williams  
in New England on Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, he was front-page news. For the second time in four  
seasons, he won the ALCS opener with an extra-inning home run. 
</P>
<P>
	Back in '96, it was an 11th-inning drive off Baltimore's Randy  
Myers. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was all I was thinking about the inning before,''  
Williams said. ``But I tried to keep it off my mind because it is a 
different pitcher, different team, but the setup is sort of the 
same. But what are the chances of it happening twice? Not too 
much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And just like in that game, an umpire helped make Williams'  
heroics possible. Against Baltimore, umpire Richie Garcia blew a 
call, giving Derek Jeter a game-tying homer in the eighth inning 
when young fan Jeffrey Maier reached over the right-field wall, 
preventing Tony Tarasco from catching the fly to right. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, Rick Reed blew a call at second base in the top of  
the 10th, ruling second baseman Chuck Knoblauch had possession of a 
throw, and calling Jose Offerman out at second. 
</P>
<P>
	If Reed had made the right call, Boston would have had runners  
on first and second with no outs against Mariano Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were trying so hard to capitalize,'' Williams said. ``We  
had a few men on base and a lot of opportunities to score, and we 
just didn't do it. If it took a break like that to get us going, it 
was welcomed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With free agency facing him, Williams slumped through the  
postseason last year, going 0-for-10 in the first round against 
Texas, 8-for-21 with five RBIs in the six-game ALCS against 
Cleveland and 1-for-16 with a homer and three RBIs in the four-game 
sweep of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	After returning to the Yankees for $87.5 million over seven  
years, he seems much more relaxed. 
</P>
<P>
	He drove in six runs in the postseason opener against the  
Rangers, and finished the first round 4-for-11, then went 2-for-5 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is very unpredictable,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said.  
``He comes up so large sometimes -- most of the time. I know it 
beats him up if he doesn't do the job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He had the Yankees' biggest hit of the regular season. After  
Boston's three-game sweep in New York, the Yankees went to Toronto 
and were beaten by David Wells in the opener of a three-game series 
on Sept. 13. 
</P>
<P>
	With their AL East lead over Boston down to 3 1/2 games, they  
trailed the Blue Jays 5-1 in the eighth inning the next night, 
knowing the Red Sox were ahead in their game. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams tied the game with his seventh career grand slam, and  
Paul O'Neill's slam put them ahead in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was a huge game for us because we were reeling a little  
bit,'' Torre said. ``He picked us up big time.''

<HEADLINE> Source Says Starr Will Step Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With his five-year, $47 million investigation  
of the Clintons winding down, Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr 
will formally step aside next week and be replaced by one of his 
assistants, Robert Ray, sources familiar with Starr's plans said 
Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray, a federal prosecutor who joined Starr's office early this  
year, was selected by a panel of three federal appeals court judges 
to succeed the controversial special prosecutor, the sources told 
The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The judges, who interviewed several of Starr's deputies, have  
not issued a formal order yet, but they told the prosecutor's 
office of their plans this week, the sources said, speaking on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	That cleared the way for Starr, who has hinted for months his  
desire to step down, to return to private law practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's office declined to comment Thursday night.  
</P>
<P>
	Ray will try to wrap up an investigation that has ranged from  
allegedly fraudulent land deals in Arkansas to impeachment charges 
of presidential perjury and obstruction of justice in the Monica 
Lewinsky scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC News first reported the selection of Ray, who came to  
Starr's office after working for Independent Counsel Donald Smaltz. 
Smaltz's office unsuccessfully prosecuted former Agriculture 
Secretary Mike Espy but won a number of convictions against 
companies and individuals who had provided gifts to the agriculture 
secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's office has two pending investigative matters:  
</P>
<P>
	--An alleged attempt to influence the testimony of presidential  
accuser Kathleen Willey. 
</P>
<P>
	--Possible false statements regarding Hillary Rodham Clinton's  
role in the purge of White House travel office employees. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Starr's successor must produce a final report on  
the Whitewater scandal -- a document that could prove to be a 
political headache for Mrs. Clinton if she follows through on plans 
to run next year for a U.S. Senate seat from New York. 
</P>
<P>
	During Starr's tenure, his office convicted 14 people, including  
the Clintons' Whitewater business partners, Jim and Susan McDougal, 
and then-Arkansas Gov. Jim Guy Tucker, who resigned his office. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's investigation of the Lewinsky scandal -- the president's  
affair and subsequent cover-up -- led to the first presidential 
impeachment since 1868. 
</P>
<P>
	But Starr's long tenure was marred by questions over whether he  
conducted his investigation properly. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr subpoenaed the first lady in front of a federal grand  
jury. The president's supporters depicted Starr as a right-wing 
zealot who abused his prosecutorial powers. 
</P>
<P>
	Susan McDougal said Starr's investigators tried to get her to  
tell lies that falsely implicated the Clintons in wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's lawyer accused Starr's office of leaking grand jury  
material to the news media. Complaints about the conduct of Starr's 
prosecutors in the Lewinsky investigation poured into the Justice 
Department from Democrats on Capitol Hill as impeachment loomed. 
</P>
<P>
	The constant attacks took their toll. Public opposition to Starr  
soared. The prosecutor said the campaign against him infected the 
judicial process, leading to deadlocked juries that refused to 
convict. Starr gave up on prosecuting Susan McDougal, whose 
cooperation he never was able to get. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's impeachment by the House in the Lewinsky scandal was  
followed by acquittal in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Late in his investigation, Starr drew additional criticism in  
bringing two indictments against Mrs. Clinton's former law partner, 
Webster Hubbell, who had already served a prison term on a guilty 
plea to stealing $400,000 from his law firm and its clients. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr said Hubbell had given incomplete testimony about his and  
the first lady's legal work on one of her Whitewater partner's 
fraudulent real estate projects. Hubbell steadfastly denied knowing 
of any wrongdoing by Mrs. Clinton. He settled the cases by pleading 
guilty to a felony in exchange for no jail time.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft, Penguin To Publish eBooks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. on Thursday announced  
partnerships with book publishers in the United Kingdom, France and 
Italy to create and distribute thousands of popular titles on 
CD-ROM, and eventually online. 
</P>
<P>
	The eBooks will be published using Microsoft Reader, the first  
product available for PCs running on the Windows operating system 
to include the company's ClearType technology. Microsoft says 
ClearType improves font resolution on LCD screens, enhancing 
on-screen reading to a level that ``approaches the convenience and 
quality of paper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the publishing venture, announced at the Frankfurt  
Book Fair, Penguin Books Ltd., a Pearson company, said it will roll 
out 1,000 titles onto CD-ROM from its English-language Penguin 
Classics, including books by Jane Austen, Charles Dickens and 
William Shakespeare. 
</P>
<P>
	Each CD-ROM will include more than a dozen -- and up to 30 --  
books, said Andrew Rosenheim, managing director for Penguin in 
London. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always been skeptical of reading books on screen,''  
Rosenheim said. ``For the first time it really is close, or 
comparable, to reading a book on paper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Using the Italian version of Microsoft Reader, Italian publisher  
Arnoldo Mondadori Editore SpA will sell eBooks and popular 
magazines on its ``eBookstore'' Web site. Thousands of Microsoft 
Reader-compatible French-language titles such as ``Le Cid,'' by 
Pierre Corneille and ``Notre-Dame de Paris,'' by Victor Hugo, will 
be available on CD-ROM -- and eventually for Internet download -- 
from the Havas Group publisher and the Web site Editions 00h00.com 
(``zero hour dot com''). 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft also announced at the book fair its founding  
sponsorship of the Frankfurt eBook Awards, which will annually 
recognize literary and technological excellence in electronic 
publishing. 
</P>
<P>
	The eBooks will be sold by software and book retailers, though  
no pricing information is yet available.

<HEADLINE> O'Neill Fights Pain for Yanks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Paul O'Neill couldn't even swing the bat without  
grimacing. But it takes more than a little pain to stop the New 
York Yankees' gritty leader. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neill, playing despite a broken rib, hit a tie-breaking bloop  
single with two outs in the seventh inning to give the Yankees a 
3-2 victory over the Boston Red Sox on Thursday night and a 2-0 
lead in the AL championship series. 
</P>
<P>
	``To put the ball in play and have it fall that way looks great  
in the paper,'' O'Neill said. ``That was a big break for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neill injured himself on the second-to-last day of the season  
running after a foul ball in a game against Tampa Bay that meant 
nothing to the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	But there is no game or play that means nothing to O'Neill, who  
has been known to throw helmets and break water coolers after bad 
at-bats in front of half-empty stadiums in June. 
</P>
<P>
	He missed the final game of the division series against Texas.  
But after being diagnosed with the broken rib on Monday, O'Neill 
talked his way onto the roster and into the lineup for the ALCS. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a vital part of this team,'' shortstop Derek Jeter said.  
``He's out there with cracked ribs or whatever it is. But he's 
still able to go out and produce. Tonight he came through with the 
big hit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He went 1-for-5 in Wednesday night's opener without hitting the  
ball out of the infield. He grimaced sliding into second base in 
the first inning in Game 1 and was in agony after making a rolling 
catch on his side to rob Troy O'Leary of a hit. 
</P>
<P>
	He crashed into the wall in the second inning Thursday night,  
trying to catch Jason Varitek's triple. He slowly retrieved the 
ball, the pain evident on his face. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today I felt really good,'' said O'Neill, who drove in his  
first run of the postseason. ``So much has been blown out of 
proportion on this (rib) thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the Yankees needed O'Neill most, he came through. Chuck  
Knoblauch tied the game at 2 with an RBI double and the Red Sox 
pitched around Derek Jeter to get to O'Neill. 
</P>
<P>
	That gave manager Jimy Williams the matchup he wanted,  
left-hander Rheal Cormier and against the lefty O'Neill. Cormier 
won the matchup Wednesday night when he got O'Neill to hit a 
comebacker in the ninth inning. 
</P>
<P>
	It looked like Cormier would come out on top again, after  
getting out in front of O'Neill 0-2. After Cormier wasted a pitch, 
O'Neill hit a ball off his fists into shallow left-center to score 
the tying run. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got a break,'' O'Neill said. ``I got jammed on a ball. It  
broke my bat but it fell in. I was very fortunate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeter slid into third and pumped his fist as he stood up.  
</P>
<P>
	O'Neill, as is typical after a successful play, showed no  
emotion at first. 
</P>
<P>
	None was needed. He had done his job.

<HEADLINE> Niners' Young May Stop Playing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Steve Young's playing days could be  
over. 
</P>
<P>
	No one came out and said it directly, least of all Young, who  
smiled but walked past reporters without a word Thursday on his way 
to watch the San Francisco 49ers practice. 
</P>
<P>
	But clearly, the groundwork is being laid for the retirement of  
Young, 38, who has been sidelined indefinitely by lingering 
symptoms from his fourth concussion in three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Gary Steinberg, the chief of neurosurgery at Stanford  
Medical School and Young's neurologist, has given Young and the 
49ers his recommendation on whether the two-time NFL MVP should 
continue playing. 
</P>
<P>
	Young, Steinberg, general manager Bill Walsh and coach Steve  
Mariucci all declined to discuss the nature of the doctor's 
recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only one who can answer that question is Steve Young,''  
Walsh said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Walsh did say he met with Young, discussed his future  
and encouraged Young to seek additional medical opinions, leading 
to the possible conclusion that Steinberg recommended Young retire 
because of the potential for long-term health risks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Five to 10 years from now, when he's feeling really fit, he's  
going to say, `Why didn't I play football? I took the advice of one 
physician. I should have really checked into it,''' Walsh said. ``I 
want to make sure he really checks into everything. He has to have 
more than one opinion, just for his own well-being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh said there might be a formal announcement of Young's  
future in the next two weeks. Young also is expected to meet Friday 
with his agent, Leigh Steinberg, who isn't related to the doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to remember Steve has been playing football all his  
life and for anyone to think that this process is going to be real 
quick and rapid, it's not going to happen that way,'' Leigh 
Steinberg said. ``It's a deliberate process. But all the people 
around Steve are trying to help him do the right things. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing is he's not playing right now so he's not hurting  
himself. He's 38 and he does have the right to make up his own mind 
about this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh, Mariucci, the doctor and the agent said Young still wants  
to play football. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's trying to hang on because he's so darn good at it.  
Certainly, in Steve's mind, there is some hope, somewhere he's 
reaching for some hope that, `Hey, I'll be back,''' Mariucci said. 
``That's what he thinks about. That's why I don't think it's going 
to happen today or tomorrow. We're going to give it its due time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steinberg said Young has shown improvement since the hit 2 1/2  
weeks ago that caused his latest concussion. However, Young 
underwent neurological tests Wednesday and again wasn't cleared to 
rejoin the 49ers on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason he hasn't been cleared to play up until now is that  
it's my opinion and the opinion of the 49ers that it's in the best 
interest of Steve Young to allow his brain to recover,'' Dr. 
Steinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	While Young viewed Steinberg's ruling as a temporary setback, it  
comes amid signs that his family, friends and some team officials 
want him to retire rather than resume playing and expose himself to 
another damaging hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Young, who endured two concussions in 1996 and another in the  
1997 season opener, suffered the latest one when he was leveled by 
blitzing Arizona cornerback Aeneas Williams and struck his head on 
tackle Dave Fiore's knee before slamming into the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Steinberg said there were no signs of bruising or permanent  
damage to Young's brain but that there are dangers from repeated 
concussions, which can lead to premature senility and other brain 
dysfunction. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to be cautious in our recommendation,'' he said.  
``This is an unpredictable kind of event. You don't have a crystal 
ball to tell what's going to happen in any particular case. But my 
advice is my opinion and I don't dictate what the ultimate team 
decision is or Steve Young's decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh said Young is being realistic about the situation and the  
49ers management was there to help him along with the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	And if he can't make it on his own?  
</P>
<P>
	``We're here,'' Walsh said. ``It would fall on us.''

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Coup Leader Under Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- With the country firmly in his  
control, Pakistan's military chief was reportedly seeking a way to 
restore constitutional democracy, a presidential spokesman said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	In a possibly ominous sign, however, troops sealed off the  
parliament building, throwing out staffers and a few lawmakers, a 
day before the legislature was scheduled to meet. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Tuesday's army coup ousted Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif,  
Gen. Pervaiz Musharraf has been sequestered in meetings with 
politicians, past and present, including conservative President 
Rafiq Tarar. 
</P>
<P>
	Tarar's spokesman, Irfan Siddiqi, said Musharraf is looking to  
restore civilian rule -- an effort the president supports. In 
Pakistan, the presidency is a largely symbolic post. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rehabilitation of the democratic process as soon as  
possible is a goal shared by both men,'' he told The Associated 
Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the coup, parliament had been slated to meet on Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	Soldiers today asked staffers and the few legislators who had  
returned to their offices to leave the building. The troops then 
closed the building. 
</P>
<P>
	``They just told us to leave,'' and provided no explanation,  
said one worker who refused to give his name. Soldiers had closed 
down parliament the night of the coup but had later allowed workers 
back in. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan's stock market, reopening for the first time since the  
coup, plunged today, and authorities ordered tight restrictions on 
foreign currency transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	Musharraf has not made any public statements since his televised  
address to the nation early Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	According to political analysts in Pakistan, Musharraf could  
call early elections; change the prime minister, but keep 
Parliament intact; induct a national coalition government of 
politicians from Pakistan's many political parties; create a civil 
administration of technocrats and retired politicians; or run the 
country himself. 
</P>
<P>
	The army has ruled Pakistan for 25 of its 52 years, although the  
country has had a fragile democracy for 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
	International demand has been building for a quick return to  
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said the  
coup created a ``level of uncertainty'' in South Asia. She said 
U.S. officials were trying to persuade Pakistan's military leaders 
to restore democratic government. 
</P>
<P>
	``A military takeover of this kind ... does make it difficult to  
continue business as usual,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan urged the army to restore  
civilian rule quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Monetary Fund, which last year negotiated a  
$1.6 billion loan to Pakistan, announced an immediate cutoff until 
democracy is restored. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists say Pakistan's battered economy can ill-afford  
further delays in international funding. Its foreign reserves are 
roughly $1.5 billion, enough to cover only two months of imports, 
in a nation heavily dependent on foreign shipments of even its 
staples, such as cooking oil. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's swift coup -- sparked by Sharif's attempt to fire  
Musharraf -- capped months of growing army resentment against the 
premier for backing away from the fight over Kashmir, a territory 
claimed by both India and Pakistan. President Clinton pressured 
Sharif into convincing Islamic fighters to pull back, reportedly 
outraging and humiliating army leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	India and Pakistan have fought three wars in 52 years, and both  
conducted nuclear tests last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington played down concerns about the coup's affect on  
Pakistan's nuclear program, since it has always been under the 
military's control. 
</P>
<P>
	India put its soldiers on alert following the coup, a move the  
army spokesman in Pakistan called ``ridiculous'' and a ploy to 
raise international concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	``India's action was totally absurd ... putting its forces on  
alert ... as if Pakistan is going to precipitate a war,'' Brig. 
Rashid Quereshi told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Many in both countries believe Musharraf orchestrated the  
incursion this spring of Islamic militants into the Indian section 
of Kashmir. That incursion led to months of bloody fighting with 
Indian troops. 
</P>
<P>
	The fighting -- which India says also involved Pakistani troops --  
wrecked fledgling negotiations between the two countries and many 
feared it would spiral into full-fledged war. 
</P>
<P>
	The location of Pakistan's ousted prime minister was unclear  
today. Newspapers reported Sharif had been sent ``to an unknown 
destination.'' Official sources however told the independent news 
agency News Network International that Sharif had been taken to his 
hometown, Lahore. 
</P>
<P>
	In the days prior to Sharif's firing of Musharraf there were  
daily newspaper reports that he had asked the army chief to resign 
so the prime minister could put his own ally, Gen. Zia Uddin, in 
the job. 
</P>
<P>
	English language newspapers today reported that several  
pro-Sharif military officials had been arrested and would be tried 
in a military court. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout Pakistan, people took the coup in stride and few  
longed for quick elections. 
</P>
<P>
	``There should be no elections before accountability,'' said  
Abdul Rashid, a lawyer in Lahore. 
</P>
<P>
	The Karachi 100-Share Index plunged 8 percent in early trading  
today because of panic selling by investors. It recovered some lost 
ground by midday. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Pakistan's growing isolation continued.  
</P>
<P>
	The Commonwealth -- a grouping of former British colonies -- said  
it might suspend Pakistan's membership, a move last taken in 1995 
against Nigeria. The European Union also said it would postpone a 
new trade deal with Pakistan for the time being.

<HEADLINE> Tigers Replace Parrish With Garner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The Detroit Tigers will have a new manager to go  
with their new ballpark next season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tigers replaced manager Larry Parrish with former Milwaukee  
Brewers manager Phil Garner on Thursday, seeking a new direction 
for a team headed to a new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tigers and Garner agreed to a four-year deal, terms of which  
were not available. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Bud Selig, whose family was Garner's former  
employer at Milwaukee, issued a statement Thursday saying he is 
investigating the hiring. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a letter to all clubs on April 14, 1999, I implemented a  
new initiative requiring all clubs to consider minority 
candidates'' for various baseball jobs. ``Clubs were instructed to 
inform me personally of such openings and to provide me their list 
of candidates, to include minority representation, prior to making 
a decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am in the process of conducting a thorough review'' of the  
Garner hiring. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've seen the statement and we will communicate with the  
commissioner's office as requested,'' Tigers spokesman Tyler Barnes 
said Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit general manager Randy Smith said Thursday that he spoke  
with Parrish and offered him the opportunity to remain in the 
organization as a scouting assistant. Parrish did not make an 
immediate decision on the new assignment. 
</P>
<P>
	Garner was fired in August after eight years at Milwaukee in the  
midst of a seventh straight losing season. He takes the reigns of a 
team that this season finished a disappointing 69-92 in Parrish's 
first full year as Detroit manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Garner's best season as Brewers manager was 1992 -- his first in  
Milwaukee -- before the payroll gap between teams got extreme. That 
season, he nearly guided the Brewers past Toronto for the AL East 
title and was runnerup for AL Manager of the Year. Milwaukee now 
plays in the NL Central. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see some good players,'' Garner said Thursday outside the  
Tigers new home, Comerica Park. ``I wouldn't tell you I'm smarter 
than anyone else, that there will be a turnaround and we'll have a 
100-win season, but I think we can do some things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Courting Garner may indicate that the Tigers will raise the  
team's payroll. Garner, 50, was reportedly so frustrated by 
Milwaukee's comparatively low payroll that he planned to resign as 
manager there at the end of this season. He left Milwaukee with a 
563-617 record. 
</P>
<P>
	Owner Mike Ilitch declined to discuss Thursday whether the  
Tigers would go on a shopping spree. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the nature of the game. There's a lot of movement in the  
game. A lot of insecurity in the game,'' Ilitch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Weeks ago, Garner said he hoped to join a team with a payroll of  
at least $50 million to $55 million, with the willingness to raise 
it by $8 million during the season to add players needed to make 
the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tigers' payroll this season was $35 million, 20th-highest  
among 30 big-league teams. 
</P>
<P>
	In introducing Garner, Smith suggested the man known as ``Scrap  
Iron'' during his playing days was the right man for the job 
because of his motivational skills and ``his burning desire to 
win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll lead us into Comerica Park and into the new  
millennium,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tigers wanted to announce the move Wednesday but ran into  
trouble with baseball commissioner Bud Selig because they failed to 
show that they considered minority candidates, Detroit radio 
station WDFN reported Thursday, quoting sources close to the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Parrish did not return messages left Thursday at his Florida  
home. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tigers are expected to take a payroll in excess of $50  
million next season into Comerica Park, a $300 million ballpark 
being built about a mile from Tiger Stadium and scheduled to be 
ready in time for next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit's record might show last season's dismal showing wasn't  
Parrish's fault, although the record also demonstrates managers 
often take the blame anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look at the numbers our team put up, I don't know what  
anyone else could have done in this situation,'' Parrish said 
shortly before the season ended. 
</P>
<P>
	Garner takes over a team that in many categories last season was  
among the worst in the majors. The Tigers had a .261 batting 
average, drew just 458 walks, struck out 1,049 times and had just 
704 RBIs. Detroit's pitching staff had a 5.17 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	Parrish took over the team on an interim basis on Sept. 1, 1998,  
after Buddy Bell was fired. The Tigers were 13-12 under Parrish and 
the club rewarded him with a two-year contract, removing the 
``interim'' label in October. 
</P>
<P>
	Before coming up to the parent club, Parrish managed several  
seasons in the Tigers' minor league system, compiling a 178-163 
record. In 1996, with Parrish at the helm, Jacksonville won both 
halves of the Southern League regular season and captured the 
league championship.

<HEADLINE>  Dodge Returns to Winston Cup Racing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Dodge will return to Winston Cup racing in 2001  
after an absence of 16 seasons, with top NASCAR crew chief Ray 
Evernham set as its flagship car owner. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler, the parent company of Dodge, announced today  
that Evernham's team would receive full factory support. 
</P>
<P>
	Evernham, who resigned last month after guiding Jeff Gordon to  
three championships in seven seasons, says he will have a two-car 
operation in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``My goal is to get to Victory Lane and take the Dodge people  
with me,'' Evernham said, standing near a sign that read 493 -- the 
number of days until the season-opening 2001 Daytona 500. 
</P>
<P>
	Evernham said part of his job will be to help develop other  
Dodge teams as they come along. NASCAR is hoping their will be 
several. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dodge's return will increase competition, and certainly make  
it deeper,'' said Mike Helton, senior vice president for the 
sanctioning body. 
</P>
<P>
	The Intrepid models Evernham will field will be the first  
Chrysler products in NASCAR's top division since Sept. 15, 1985, 
when Maurice Randall finished last in one of two Chryslers entered 
in the Delaware 500 at Dover Downs International Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	The last Dodge in a Winston Cup race finished 30th with Phil  
Good behind the wheel on June 9, 1985 at Pocono International 
Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
	Chrysler had a tradition of victory in NASCAR. Petty  
Enterprises, its most prolific winner ever, had 237 of its 271 
victories in Chrysler brands. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Petty himself had 175 of his record 200 career victories  
and six of his series-best seven championships in Plymouths and 
Dodges. 
</P>
<P>
	But the auto maker withdrew tech and parts support in the late  
'70s. Petty went winless in 1978, and jumped to General Motors the 
next year, leaving the few remaining Chryslers cars in the hands of 
underfunded independents. 
</P>
<P>
	The late Neil Bonnett accounted for the last Dodge victory, in  
the Los Angeles Times 500 on Nov. 20, 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	Chrysler began its comeback in the sport when Dodges were  
campaigned in the NASCAR truck series in 1995. Since factory 
backing began in 1997, Dodges they have won seven races. 
</P>
<P>
	Evernham, who called the shots for the first 47 of Gordon's 49  
career victories, did not make any announcement concerning drivers 
or other personnel for his team.

<HEADLINE> FCC Report Backs Loose Web Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Communications Commission should  
avoid stepping in to regulate high-speed Internet access over cable 
pipes and let market forces shape the future of this emerging 
market, according to a report by FCC staff. 
</P>
<P>
	The study released Wednesday by the commission's Cable Services  
Bureau doesn't rule out the possibility that the FCC could in the 
future force providers of cable Internet service to share their 
lines with competitors. But for the time being, the study asserts 
that government regulation is not warranted -- reinforcing the 
position the FCC already has taken. 
</P>
<P>
	Public interest groups and some Internet providers have argued  
that unless cable companies are required to open their systems to 
rivals, consumers won't have access to a variety of information 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC staff said the study offers further justification of why it  
is too soon for regulators to intervene. As of August, just a 
little more than 1 million consumers were subscribing to high-speed 
cable service in North America -- a fraction of the 40 million 
residential Internet subscribers total. So-called broadband access 
over cable lines provides connection speeds dozens of times faster 
than today's dial-up telephone modems. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of 2005, more than 11 million consumers will be using  
these cable connections. But the majority of Internet users will 
still rely on the traditional dial-up modems, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	With such small numbers, the staff study says, there is no  
evidence that cable operators will dominate the market in a way 
that is anti-competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll continue to look at this through the eyes of  
consumers,'' FCC Chairman Bill Kennard said in an interview. ``When 
we hear that consumers are being denied choice and openness in the 
broadband world, we will clearly have to take action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, he added, ``I don't think that's the case right now.''  
</P>
<P>
	The study also asserts that customer demand is likely to force  
cable companies to give other Internet service providers access to 
their systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Cable companies, Internet providers, consumer advocates and  
financial analysts offered opinions on whether government 
regulation was appropriate now, said Deborah Lathen, chief of the 
cable services bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one identified market failures that would justify  
intervention for us at this time,'' said Lathen. 
</P>
<P>
	The study also highlights concerns that regulation might slow  
how long it takes to get such advanced services to consumers 
nationwide. Potential investors indicated that the government's 
stepping in too soon could chill the flow of dollars toward 
building high-speed connections, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cable companies entering the market actually have spurred  
competition by other providers of high-speed connections, like 
telephone companies, according to the report. As of midyear, 
160,000 consumers were using digital subscriber lines from their 
phone companies, the report said. And some fixed wireless companies 
and satellite systems also will compete for customers in a few 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	But public interest groups oppose the wait-and-see attitude.  
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that 'watchful waiting' causes damage,'' wrote the  
Center for Media Education, the Media Access Project and others in 
a letter. 
</P>
<P>
	The head of the National Cable Television Association, Robert  
Sachs, said the study shows that competition is happening in the 
industry and ``that government regulation would only slow the 
delivery of high-speed Internet service to consumers.''

<HEADLINE> Babbitt Decries Casino Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- To Bruce Babbitt it was akin to ``an  
old-fashioned lynching'' -- an Old West metaphor he often would use 
to describe the accusations and turmoil that hung over him for 
nearly two years. 
</P>
<P>
	A straight arrow who once was a name away from being on the U.S.  
Supreme Court, Babbitt's life changed when he was accused of 
rejecting a proposed Indian casino because of campaign 
contributions and then allegedly lying to Congress about it. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, a special prosecutor concluded a 19-month  
investigation into the charges and said there was insufficient 
evidence to show Babbitt had violated the law -- either in his 
testimony before Congress or in the casino decision itself. 
</P>
<P>
	Independent Counsel Carol Elder Bruce, a veteran prosecutor who  
had been assigned the case in March 1998, said she would not seek 
indictments against Babbitt or anyone else involved in the casino 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt's response was muted as he issued a three-sentence  
statement in which he said he was ``gratified'' the prosecutor and 
grand jury had determined no charges were justified. ``That is not 
surprising,'' he added. A spokesman said Babbitt had no further 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, in a statement, called Babbitt, whom he once  
nearly nominated to the Supreme Court, ``a man of the highest 
integrity'' and said, ``I was convinced he would be vindicated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of five Clinton Cabinet members to be subject to independent  
counsel investigations, Babbitt in recent months had been 
increasingly optimistic that no formal charges would be filed. 
</P>
<P>
	While praising Bruce's ``professional investigation,'' the  
bitterness toward his accusers -- the ``lynch mob'' as he frequently 
refers to them -- has not disappeared. Still, he relishes in having 
survived his antagonists, especially those on Capitol Hill, say 
those close to Babbitt. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce, in a statement issued by her office, said there was not  
enough evidence to seek criminal indictments against Babbitt or 
anyone else involved in the 1995 decision to reject the casino 
permit sought by three Wisconsin Indian tribes. 
</P>
<P>
	The three Chippewa tribes claimed the decision was influenced by  
promises of campaign contributions to the Democratic Party by 
tribes opposed to the casino. The rival tribes eventually 
contributed more than $300,000 to the party. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bruce's office said the evidence ``would not support''  
allegations of ``a criminal quid pro quo'' or any ``explicit 
agreement'' between opponents of the casino and government 
officials involved in the decision. The prosecutor also concluded 
``that the evidence was insufficient'' to prove Babbitt committed 
perjury in statements at a Senate hearing about the casino 
decision, the statement continued. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation involved interviews or grand jury testimony of  
more than 450 people and 630,000 pages of documents, investigators 
said. Bruce was expected to close the case when she submits a 
lengthy report on her investigation to a special three-judge panel 
of the U.S. Court of Appeals, possibly within weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce was one of five independent counsel investigations of  
Clinton Cabinet officers in addition to Kenneth Starr's 
investigation of the president. One investigation involving Labor 
Secretary Alexis Herman remains unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, former Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros pleaded  
guilty to a misdemeanor after a four-year, $9 million probe into 
charges he lied about payments to a former mistress; former 
Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was acquitted in December on 
charges of taking improper gifts; and an independent counsel probe 
of former Commerce Secretary Ron Brown ended when Brown died in a 
plane crash in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno asked for an independent counsel for  
Babbitt in February 1998. A month later Bruce was given the case by 
the special three-judge panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt complained he was being attacked for political reasons  
and that the allegations already had been thoroughly aired at 
hearings in both the Senate and House, and internally by the 
Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	But in Senate committee testimony, a lobbyist for the pro-casino  
tribes, Paul Eckstein, said Babbitt -- a longtime friend and former 
law partner -- had told him in a private meeting of pressure from 
the White House, particularly from Harold Ickes, then deputy White 
House chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt, before the same committee, vigorously denied any such  
pressure, although he acknowledged meeting with Eckstein on the day 
the casino decision was made and telling him of White House 
pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the remark was to get Eckstein out of the office and  
denied mentioning campaign contributions.

<HEADLINE> Medical Group To Fine Mass. Doctors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- A group of doctors has established a  
policy that fines its members $250 per day for each day of a 
patient's hospital stay that is deemed unnecessary. Critics called 
the plan immoral. 
</P>
<P>
	The penalty will apply to the 350 physicians in the Mount Auburn  
Cambridge Independent Practice Association Inc., according to an 
internal memorandum obtained by today's Boston Globe. 
</P>
<P>
	The policy, which takes effect Nov. 1, is intended to curb  
medical costs by influencing doctor behavior, while preserving the 
doctor's right to make independent clinical decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the memo, case managers will examine hospital  
admissions to identify unnecessary stays. They will call the doctor 
who sent the patient to the hospital and offer ``alternative 
treatment plans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the case manager disagrees with the physician over the  
admission, the dispute will be decided by a committee of a dozen 
doctors in the Mount Auburn practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our work is to try to identify and eliminate waste, and  
improve the care we deliver to patients,'' said Dr. Rob Janett, 
medical director of the practice. ``An unnecessary day in the 
hospital is not only expensive, it is also potentially harmful to 
patients.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plan has been criticized by physicians in the group and some  
medical ethicists for being too punitive, and because it could lead 
to denial of necessary medical care. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pushing the envelope,'' said Dr. David Himmelstein, an  
internist with the group. ``We've been bordering on the immoral for 
a long time. This clearly goes over that edge. I am horrified, but 
not surprised.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Massachusetts Medical Society and the American Medical  
Society also disapprove of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Physician-incentive payments should be based on performance of  
groups of physicians, rather than individual physicians,'' said 
Yael Miller, director of health systems at the Massachusetts 
Medical Society.

<HEADLINE> Singer Takes Jab at NYC Mayor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- A little bit of the mayor's race in New  
York City has made it to the heart of blues country. 
</P>
<P>
	Singer-songwriter Jill Sobule of New York wrote and performed a  
song Thursday at the Associated Press Managing Editors conference, 
tweaking Mayor Rudolph Giuliani for his fervent opposition to an 
exhibit at the Brooklyn Museum of Art that includes a painting of 
the Virgin Mary decorated with dung. 
</P>
<P>
	The song, titled ``Call Rudy,'' includes the lyrics: ``Call Rudy  
if your art's a little queer, call Rudy, election year is near. 
Don't call the Whitney, don't call the Met, don't call MoMa, lest 
you forget. You can be a sensation on every news station, lines 
round the block to see your degradation. It's your duty, call 
Rudy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sobule performed the song during an APME panel discussion on  
music censorship. 
</P>
<P>
	Sobule, who scored a hit with her 1995 song ``I Kissed a Girl,''  
says she plans to record ``Call Rudy.''

<HEADLINE> Nursing Home Operator Seeks Ch. 11 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Sun Healthcare Group, one of the  
nation's largest nursing home chains, has filed for bankruptcy 
protection after more than a year of severe losses it blames on 
declining Medicare fees. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chapter 11 filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware will  
enable Sun to restructure its debts and give it more time to pay 
back creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun, which had $1.4 billion in losses from October 1998 through  
last June, provides care to about 40,000 people at its 320 nursing 
home facilities nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun is the second big nursing home chain to file for bankruptcy  
protection recently. Louisville, Ky.-based Vencor filed for 
bankruptcy protection in September after reporting $1.4 billion in 
debts.

	Albuquerque-based Sun said Thursday it obtained $200 million in  
financing from a group led by The CIT Group/Business Credit and 
Heller Healthcare Finance. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Vencor, Sun cited severe Medicare cuts implemented last  
year for its financial situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Deep cuts in Medicare reimbursement exceeded all industry  
expectations,'' Sun chairman and chief executive Andrew L. Turner 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, Medicare changes also resulted in a sharp decline in  
demand for Sun's therapy services. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun has already cut more than 10,000 jobs and has missed making  
debt payments in the past year. It also has been hit by a series of 
lawsuits from investors who contend the company should have known 
the new reimbursement system would hurt earnings and should have 
warned shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun Healthcare in August reported a second-quarter loss of $589  
million, compared to a $61 million loss in the second quarter of 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The bankruptcy protection ensures that Sun ``can continue to  
serve our patients and our customers' patients while we 
reorganize,'' said Sun president Mark Wimer.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Will Make Ban An Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrats are pledging to make Senate  
rejection of a historic nuclear test ban treaty a political issue 
for 2000. Republican opponents of the pact call it fatally flawed 
and dispute that the vote will command much campaign attention. 
</P>
<P>
	On a largely party line vote, the Senate defeated the  
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty late Wednesday, 51-48. Only four 
Senate Republicans voted for the treaty. The United States thus 
became the first nuclear power to specifically reject the 
154-nation agreement on ending nuclear weapons testing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I assure you the fight is far from over,'' President Clinton  
said after the vote. He said he still will encourage other 
countries to ratify the treaty and predicted eventual U.S. support. 
The 1996 treaty cannot take effect without U.S. ratification. 
</P>
<P>
	At the State Department, spokesman James P. Rubin said Secretary  
of State Madeleine Albright has directed all U.S. Embassies to make 
clear the seven-year moratorium on U.S. nuclear test explosions 
would be continued. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Senate has done a grievous blow to our leadership in the  
nonproliferation field,'' he said. ``But this administration and 
Secretary Albright intend to fight to overcome that blow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But few on either side of the political aisle expected to see  
another vote on the treaty anytime soon in the 
Republican-controlled Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart today termed the Senate vote  
``a toxic brew of reckless partisanship and dangerous 
isolationism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you've seen from the reaction around the world what  
message was sent,'' Lockhart added. He said the administration 
would ``continue our position of not testing and using the 
technology available to us to keep our deterrent strong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't take long for Democrats to promise to try to convert  
their embarrassing defeat -- the test ban treaty had been a top 
Clinton administration foreign policy priority -- into a political 
attack on Republicans both in the presidential and congressional 
races. 
</P>
<P>
	They claimed polls show most Americans favor such a ban -- first  
proposed by President Dwight Eisenhower in 1958 and endorsed, in 
various forms, by every president since. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect that this should be and will be a national issue  
next year in the presidential elections,'' said Senate Minority 
Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D. 
</P>
<P>
	Wasting little time, Vice President Al Gore jumped right in. In  
his first television advertisement of the 2000 presidential race, 
Gore pledges to make a campaign issue out of the defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	``This vote goes against the tide of history,'' Gore says in the  
ad to air this week in Iowa, New Hampshire and nationally on CNN, 
according to a script released by the campaign. Furthermore, Gore 
said Wednesday night that he would resubmit the treaty if he wins 
the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush has condemned  
the treaty, as have Elizabeth Dole and the two Senate Republicans 
who are presidential hopefuls: John McCain of Arizona and Orrin 
Hatch of Utah; as well as Sen. Bob Smith, Ind-N.H. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, one of a small band of conservatives who managed to block  
efforts by moderate Republicans to put off a vote, said after 
Wednesday night's vote that he wasn't surprised Democrats would 
seek to make the rejection a big campaign issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, that's the way it is in politics,'' he said. He  
said the vote was the right course. ``It's better to be definitive 
than to delay,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the Senate majority leader, said he  
doubted that Democrats could turn the Senate rejection into a 
winning campaign issue because ``this one is not a close call.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He portrayed the treaty as badly flawed and said, ``The American  
people are smarter than they (Democrats) give them credit for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents argued the treaty was not verifiable and would not  
stop the nuclear ambitions of North Korea and Iran. Further, they 
argued it would harm efforts to maintain the safety and reliability 
of the U.S. nuclear arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time the Senate has ever rejected an arms  
control treaty and the first time any treaty had been rejected 
since an unpopular agreement dealing with airline overflight rights 
and exposure to international lawsuits had been rejected in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	After sitting on the treaty for two years, Lott and Senate  
Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms, R-N.C., suddenly 
brought the measure to the floor for a vote, knowing that it would 
be rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the treaty was signed by 154 nations, including the  
United States, it has been ratified by only 26 of the 44 
nuclear-capable states that must approve it to put it into force.

<HEADLINE> FCC Report Backs Loose Web Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Communications Commission should  
avoid stepping in to regulate high-speed Internet access over cable 
pipes and let market forces shape the future of this emerging 
market, according to a report by FCC staff. 
</P>
<P>
	The study released Wednesday by the commission's Cable Services  
Bureau doesn't rule out the possibility that the FCC could in the 
future force providers of cable Internet service to share their 
lines with competitors. But for the time being, the study asserts 
that government regulation is not warranted -- reinforcing the 
position the FCC already has taken. 
</P>
<P>
	Public interest groups and some Internet providers have argued  
that unless cable companies are required to open their systems to 
rivals, consumers won't have access to a variety of information 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC staff said the study offers further justification of why it  
is too soon for regulators to intervene. As of August, just a 
little more than 1 million consumers were subscribing to high-speed 
cable service in North America -- a fraction of the 40 million 
residential Internet subscribers total. So-called broadband access 
over cable lines provides connection speeds dozens of times faster 
than today's dial-up telephone modems. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of 2005, more than 11 million consumers will be using  
these cable connections. But the majority of Internet users will 
still rely on the traditional dial-up modems, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	With such small numbers, the staff study says, there is no  
evidence that cable operators will dominate the market in a way 
that is anti-competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll continue to look at this through the eyes of  
consumers,'' FCC Chairman Bill Kennard said in an interview. ``When 
we hear that consumers are being denied choice and openness in the 
broadband world, we will clearly have to take action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, he added, ``I don't think that's the case right now.''  
</P>
<P>
	The study also asserts that customer demand is likely to force  
cable companies to give other Internet service providers access to 
their systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Cable companies, Internet providers, consumer advocates and  
financial analysts offered opinions on whether government 
regulation was appropriate now, said Deborah Lathen, chief of the 
cable services bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one identified market failures that would justify  
intervention for us at this time,'' said Lathen. 
</P>
<P>
	The study also highlights concerns that regulation might slow  
how long it takes to get such advanced services to consumers 
nationwide. Potential investors indicated that the government's 
stepping in too soon could chill the flow of dollars toward 
building high-speed connections, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cable companies entering the market actually have spurred  
competition by other providers of high-speed connections, like 
telephone companies, according to the report. As of midyear, 
160,000 consumers were using digital subscriber lines from their 
phone companies, the report said. And some fixed wireless companies 
and satellite systems also will compete for customers in a few 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	But public interest groups oppose the wait-and-see attitude.  
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that 'watchful waiting' causes damage,'' wrote the  
Center for Media Education, the Media Access Project and others in 
a letter. 
</P>
<P>
	The head of the National Cable Television Association, Robert  
Sachs, said the study shows that competition is happening in the 
industry and ``that government regulation would only slow the 
delivery of high-speed Internet service to consumers.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Wants Gay Rights Out of Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans would like to remove legislation  
that would expand federal civil rights law to cover homosexuals 
from a larger bill, but Democrats say they'll fight to keep it in. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hate crimes are modern-day lynchings,'' Sen. Edward Kennedy,  
D-Mass., said Wednesday. ``Congress has a responsibility to act 
this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democrats succeeded in July in adding the measure to a  
spending bill for the Commerce, Justice and State departments. The 
House version of the bill does not include the gay rights measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders now want the issue removed, said John  
Czwartacki, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, 
R-Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents have said the measure would discriminate by creating  
special classes of victims such as gays, would usurp states' rights 
and would have a ``chilling effect'' on free speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``What crime isn't a hate crime?'' Czwartacki said. ``It's  
offensive to any family who's a victim of a crime to say that their 
crime is somehow less hurtful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would add acts of hatred motivated by sexual  
orientation, gender and disability to the list of hate crimes 
already covered by federal law -- acts sparked by prejudice based on 
race, religion, color or national origin. It would boost penalties 
for the crimes and allow federal prosecutors to step in if local 
authorities decide against prosecuting. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton repeated his call for passage of the bill,  
noting that Wednesday was the first anniversary of the beating 
death of Matthew Shepard, a gay college freshman. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been year since the murder of Matthew Shepard and two  
years since I first proposed to strengthen the nation's hate crime 
law,'' Clinton said Wednesday. ``The nation cannot afford to 
wait.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Corcoran Gallery of Art, the first art  
museum in the capital, is getting a new chief curator -- Jacquelyn 
Days Serwer, 54, now curator of at the National Museum of American 
Art. 
</P>
<P>
	Founded in 1859 near the White House, the gallery began with a  
collection of more than 900 American works that belonged to 
financier William Wilson Corcoran. He died in 1888. It has since 
branched out to include European work and a leading art school, 
recently renamed the Corcoran College of Art and Desigin with a 
separate campus in the Georgetown area of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Serwer's predecessor, Jack Cowart, has left to become  
director of the Roy Lichtenstein Foundation In New York. She will 
take her new post in December.

<HEADLINE> Texas Executes Cheerleader Killer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- A man who nicknamed himself ``Animal''  
was executed by injection Thursday for the rape-slaying of an 
18-year-old high school cheerleader, one of three people killed 
during a daylong murder spree in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry McFadden, 51, made no final statement.  
</P>
<P>
	The mother of victim Suzanne Denise Harrison burst into tears as  
she entered the death chamber, crying, ``He looked at me.'' She 
turned away and said, ``He took our children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The victim's brother, Craig Harrison, got as close to the window  
as he could to see McFadden gasp and sputter twice. ``He's 
gutless,'' Harrison said of McFadden. 
</P>
<P>
	The discovery of the three victims from Hawkins, about 100 miles  
east of Dallas, and subsequent arrest of McFadden, on parole after 
three rape convictions, made the former telephone cable installer 
one of the region's most notorious criminals. 
</P>
<P>
	The long-haired, tattoo-covered McFadden enhanced the reputation  
when he broke out of the Upshur County Jail before his capital 
murder trial. He took a female jailer hostage and for three days 
evaded one of the most intense manhunts in Texas history. A dragnet 
involved some 1,200 officers before McFadden was caught. 
</P>
<P>
	The jailer managed to escape unhurt from a railroad boxcar.  
</P>
<P>
	McFadden was condemned for raping and beating Ms. Harrison, a  
high school cheerleader, then strangling her with her own 
underwear. Two friends who accompanied her on May 4, 1986, for a 
Sunday drive were shot to death. 
</P>
<P>
	McFadden never was charged with the other killings.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile in Utah, 35-year-old Joseph Mitchell Parsons was  
scheduled to be executed at 12:01 a.m. Friday for fatally stabbing 
a man.

<HEADLINE> GOP Blasted for Test Ban Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The arms control community Thursday declared  
war on conservative Republicans who engineered the defeat of the 
global nuclear test ban treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	In the aftermath of the Senate rejection of the treaty, think  
tankers who have labored for decades to curb nuclear weapons blamed 
fierce partisanship and a GOP determination to hurt President 
Clinton for the setback. 
</P>
<P>
	At a session sponsored by the private Arms Control Association,  
they denounced Republicans who carried the day as arrogant and 
ill-informed. 
</P>
<P>
	With 82 percent of the American public in support of a ban on  
nuclear weapons tests, according to polls, they called for making 
the treaty a partisan issue in the year 2000 congressional 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Some held out hope that the treaty could be revived and sail  
through the Senate if Republican presidential hopeful George W. 
Bush wins. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Texas governor opposed the treaty, he also supported  
the unilateral freeze on tests begun by his father, former 
President Bush, in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	For 40 years, a combination of Republicans and Democrats  
approved a long string of arms control treaties, taking their 
initial cue from President Eisenhower, who called for a ban on 
testing in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
	But for the time-being, at least, said Spurgeon Keeny, president  
of the Arms Control Association, ``the Republican Party has been 
taken over by a very small group of extremists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They are determined to dismantle as much of the arms control  
framework as possible,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	John Steinbruner of the Brookings Institution denounced ``these  
incredible, arrogant people oblivious to the danger'' of defeating 
the treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbruner said he was most worried about the impact on Russia,  
which has 3,000 nuclear weapons that could be fired against U.S. 
targets within 10 to 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate vote may be interpreted by Moscow as evidence the  
United States was preparing for confrontation, especially when 
combined with the expansion of NATO and Clinton's program for a 
missile defense, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	John Isaacs, president of the Council for a Livable World,  
questioned Clinton's handling of the treaty. To the president, 
Isaacs said, foreign policy always has taken second place to such 
domestic issues as health care and the minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
	Isaacs added, however, ``We hope to go after Republican senators  
up for re-election in 2000 who are already vulnerable and hit them 
on this issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty was rejected Wednesday on a party-line vote of 51-48.  
This was 19 votes short of the 67 needed to ratify the treaty 
Clinton signed in 1996 and has made a centerpiece of his foreign 
policy record. 
</P>
<P>
	Only four Republicans voted to approve the treaty, which would  
impose a global ban on nuclear weapons tests and set up a 
monitoring system to detect cheating. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first arms control accord ever rejected by the  
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics of the ban argued it could make it harder to maintain a  
reliable U.S. nuclear arsenal and that safeguards against tests by 
other nations were inadequate.

<HEADLINE> 'Bonecrusher' Jail Guard Testifies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HANFORD, Calif. (AP) -- A former prison guard nicknamed  
``Bonecrusher'' testified Thursday that he feels no compassion for 
an inmate who was repeatedly raped by a known sexual predator. 
</P>
<P>
	Roscoe Pondexter told jurors in the trial of four Corcoran State  
Prison guards accused of setting up the rape that inmate Eddie 
Dillard was of little consequence to him at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Pondexter, testifying for the prosecution under a grant of  
immunity, has repeatedly said that his fellow officers knew they 
were endangering the 23-year-old Dillard when they left him in a 
cell with Wayne Robertson. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say the guards did it to punish Dillard for kicking  
a female guard. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you thought Eddie Dillard was in peril, wouldn't you do  
something to see he was released from the cell with Robertson?'' 
asked defense lawyer Katherine Heart during the second day of 
Pondexter's cross examination. 
</P>
<P>
	``Probably not,'' said Pondexter after a long silence. ``If he  
comes up to me and says 'I'm being raped,' or 'I'm being physically 
assaulted,' I would act on that. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I have no compassion for Eddie Dillard, so it doesn't  
matter to me that he's feeling all these things,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pondexter said it was his job to teach newly arrived inmates  
that Corcoran State Prison was a place where the guards were in 
charge and wouldn't hesitate to use violence to maintain order. 
</P>
<P>
	Pondexter was fired from his job as a Corcoran guard after being  
accused of using excessive force on inmates -- a practice that 
earned him the nickname ``Bonecrusher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's angry at his employer and that's part of his  
impetus to this,'' said defense lawyer Curtis Sisk during a break 
in the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	After two failed state investigations, Pondexter broke ranks and  
supported Dillard's account in testimony to a special grand jury, 
which indicted the guards last year on charges of aiding and 
abetting the rape. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Decker, Dale Brakebill, Anthony Sylva and Joe Sanchez  
face up to nine years in prison if convicted.

<HEADLINE> Five Added to U.N. Security Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The U.N. General Assembly has selected  
Mali, Tunisia, Jamaica, Bangladesh and Ukraine as the newest 
temporary members of the Security Council, the most powerful U.N. 
decision-making body. 
</P>
<P>
	The five members, selected Thursday, each get two-year terms.  
They will replace Bahrain, Brazil, Gabon, Gambia and Slovenia, 
whose terms expire Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	The 15-member Security Council is responsible primarily for  
maintaining international peace and security. The council alone has 
the power to make decisions about things like imposing sanctions 
and authorizing military force that all 188 member states must 
accept. 
</P>
<P>
	Five council seats are held permanently by the United States,  
Britain, France, China and Russia. Each year, five of the 10 
nonpermanent seats come up for election to a two-year term. 
</P>
<P>
	Four of this year's temporary seats were all but decided weeks  
ago when Mali, Tunisia, Jamaica and Bangladesh won endorsements 
from their regional groups. Going into the vote, only one seat was 
still contested: Ukraine and Slovakia were vying for the right to 
represent Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	It took four rounds of balloting Thursday for Ukraine to secure  
the required two-thirds majority. Slovak Ambassador Peter Tomka 
withdrew his country's candidacy after the third round, when 
Ukraine came within a vote of the necessary 114 ballots, but a 
fourth round was required to make it official.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Question IOC on Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers on a House panel investigating  
Atlanta's bid for the 1996 Summer Games today questioned the 
International Olympic Committee's commitment to reforming the bid 
process for selecting cities to host the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ron Klink, D-Pa., the senior Democrat on the House Commerce  
subcommittee on investigations and oversight, said he's ``skeptical 
that the IOC is serious this time'' about changing the bidding 
culture that produced the Salt Lake City scandal and Atlanta's 
admitted violation of IOC rules in lavishing gifts and favors on 
committee members. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Joe. Barton, R-Texas, called for the removal of IOC  
President Juan Antonio Samaranch ``sooner rather than later.'' He 
said Samaranch has ``created a cesspool at the international 
level'' and should not be permitted to oversee the reform effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., said the IOC has been ``remarkably  
slow'' in enacting reforms recommended by a commission headed by 
former Sen. George Mitchell. If the IOC fails to embrace meaningful 
change, Waxman predicted there will be ``a strong bipartisan push 
in Congress for punitive sanctions against the IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The comments came in lengthy opening statements at a hearing  
called to examine Atlanta's bid efforts and to formulate 
recommendations for change. 
</P>
<P>
	Billy Payne, head of the Atlanta committee that won the 1996  
games, acknowledged that the city's efforts to persuade IOC members 
``included excessive actions, and even thought processes, that 
today seem inappropriate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I completely agree that the international process of bidding  
for the Olympic Games is dramatically in need of reform,'' said 
Payne. ``We are prepared to assist this subcommittee and the IOC in 
any way possible in making that reform a reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Fred Upton. R-Mich., chairman of the panel, said Samaranch  
has agreed to appear Dec. 15 to testify about reforms the IOC is 
planning to implement in early December. The IOC created a special 
commission to recommend changes after the Salt Lake City scandal 
resulted in two federal indictments and the resignations or forced 
expulsions of 10 IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Hybl, president of the U.S. Olympic Committee, testified  
that the USOC should have better control over American cities 
bidding to host the Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``The USOC could have done more to oversee the Atlanta and Salt  
Lake City bid processes,'' Hybl said in his prepared statement. 
``If we had done so, we would probably not be here today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IOC officials have denied a ``culture of corruption'' surrounded  
the way Olympic cities were selected, despite evidence its members 
accepted expensive gifts, trips, scholarships and cash from bid 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta initially denied bid excesses, but amended its report to  
Congress after Upton's committee uncovered documents indicating 
otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	Some IOC members have wondered why U.S. lawmakers continue to  
probe the scandal when the publicity harms Salt Lake City's 
struggle to raise money for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Nick Vehr, head of Cincinnati's campaign to host the 2012 Summer  
Games, believes what happens with Salt Lake City will determine how 
much time must pass before the IOC is willing to award the Olympics 
to another U.S. city. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the 2002 Winter Games are successful it will have a greater  
impact on a U.S. city's selection than any event in Washington,'' 
Vehr said.

<HEADLINE> Steelers' Bettis Grinds to a Halt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The Bus stops here.  
</P>
<P>
	And in Buffalo. And in Baltimore.  
</P>
<P>
	The only running back to gain more than 1,000 yards in each of  
his first three Pittsburgh Steelers seasons -- even Franco Harris 
didn't do it -- Jerome Bettis was a steady constant amid a sea of 
change. 
</P>
<P>
	The quarterback changed, from Neil O'Donnell to Kordell Stewart.  
The offensive coordinator changed -- twice. The fullback changed. So 
did most of the blockers who led Bettis' 25 or so carries every 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bettis has ground to a halt and, until Sunday's 24-21 loss  
in Buffalo, so had the Steelers offense. Through five games, Bettis 
has 256 yards, or about his average production for two Sundays. His 
3.3 yards-per-carry average is the lowest of his seven-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	The effect of Bettis' breakdown on the Steelers has been  
dramatic, almost overwhelming. Without the accustomed yardage from 
a back who rushed for 4,281 yards the last three seasons, the 
Steelers' starting offense has yet to score a touchdown at home 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Bettis' falloff has contributed to yet another slump, that of  
Stewart, who went nearly half a season without throwing a touchdown 
pass to a wide receiver until getting two Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The result: the Steelers' 2-3 record is their worst through five  
games since 1990. And if it weren't for a season-opening 43-0 
victory over expansion Cleveland, their 14.5 scoring average over 
their last four games would be one of the NFL's lowest. 
</P>
<P>
	``Defenses are selling out to stop the run,'' left tackle Wayne  
Gandy said. ``If we can't throw deep, they're going to keep 
cheating the safeties up to stop the run. As soon as the safeties 
sense it's a running play, they're coming up to play it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bettis had no room to run in Buffalo, managing 24 yards on 13  
carries as the Steelers rushed for 48 yards, their lowest total in 
two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Bettis missed training camp following two knee surgeries, but he  
insists he's not a broken-down Bus. Like Gandy, he blames the 
breakdown of the long-reliable Steelers running game on the 
offense's inability to stretch the field and make defenses respect 
their throwing. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart's longest completion of 42 yards came in the opener, and  
he has had only a few throws in the 20-yard range since. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to be able to run the football,'' Bettis said.  
``Definitely, it starts with consistency in the running game. To 
win football games, we have to run the football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Steelers suddenly forgot how to run late last season. Bettis  
had four 100-yard games in his first eight games in 1998 but has 
only two, none this season, in the last 13 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Not surprisingly, the Steelers are 2-8 since they won seven of  
their first 11 games last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, as now, the missing element has been the deep pass.  
</P>
<P>
	``When you're completing them for eight, nine yards, people  
still can gear up to stop the run. You hit some big passes, they 
can't do that,'' Gandy said. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why Bettis doesn't buy into the theory the Steelers  
should be satisfied with losing in Buffalo because Stewart played 
his best game in nearly a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It bothers me when you're comfortable with a loss,'' Bettis  
said. ``That's what hurts. We were mad we had an opportunity to win 
the football game and we didn't. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're struggling a little bit on offense, you have to  
take what you can get. t doesn't come as easy as it used to. You've 
got to appreciate the upside, because we all know about the 
downside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The downside included two losses to the Cincinnati Bengals last  
season. The Bengals (1-4) are 4-17 the last two seasons, with half 
their victories against Pittsburgh. The teams play again Sunday in 
Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're 2-3, and you don't want to go to 2-4,'' Bettis said.  
``We want to build a good performance last week into a win this 
week.''

<HEADLINE> Fire Ready To Defend MLS Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) -- Most days, the Chicago Fire try to  
forget that warm, sunny day in Pasadena last October when they 
hoisted the Major League Soccer championship trophy over their 
heads. 
</P>
<P>
	This is, after all, a new season, and daydreaming about last  
year doesn't do much good. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's good to reminisce every once and awhile. Now, with the  
MLS playoffs about to begin, would be a very good time for the Fire 
to remember just how they got that trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year was in the past, but that feeling comes back,'' Fire  
forward-midfielder Frank Klopas said after practice Thursday. 
``It's always harder to repeat, but the positive thing is we've 
been through it. We realize how hard we worked last year and the 
demands and sacrifices we had to make. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to have that same hunger and attitude we had last  
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Fire (18-14) begin defense of their title Saturday in Dallas  
when they face the Burn (19-13) in the best-of-3 Western Conference 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colorado Rapids (20-12) play the Los Angeles Galaxy (20-12)  
in the other Western Conference semifinal. In the Eastern 
Conference, the Miami Fusion (13-19) play D.C. United (23-9), and 
the Tampa Bay Mutiny (14-18) play the Columbus Crew (19-13). 
</P>
<P>
	Winners of the conference finals will meet Nov. 21 in the MLS  
Cup at Foxboro Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the Fire had it easy. Or as easy as playoffs can get.  
No one expected much from them; heck, just getting to the playoffs 
was impressive enough. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Fire swept the Rapids in the conference semifinals, and  
then beat the Galaxy in the finals. That put them in the MLS Cup, 
and they stunned D.C. United, the league's two-time defending 
champion, 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great feeling, walking on the stage and holding up that  
trophy, celebrating in the locker room,'' Klopas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending a title, however, is another matter.  
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing has come easy for this team,'' coach Bob Bradley said.  
``It's a credit to this team, but I think things easily could have 
gone off track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Fire was knocked down to third place in the Western  
Conference when Dallas won last weekend, and they're still smarting 
from a loss on penalty kicks to Costa Rica in the CONCACAF 
Champions Cup semifinals. They also lost to an A-League team, the 
Rochester Raging Rhinos, in the U.S. Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago was in eight shootouts this season, losing five. The  
team is beaten up, too. Forward Josh Wolff, the No. 2 scorer with 
10 goals, is out with a torn ligament in his left knee. Midfielders 
Diego Gutierrez and Jesse Marsch and defenders Francis Okaroh and 
Tommy Soehn are ailing, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always harder the second year,'' said forward Ante Razov,  
whose 14 goals led the Fire and ranked sixth in the league. ``It's 
really been a tough season for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Things won't be much easier against the Burn. While Dallas'  
record isn't much better, the Burn ended the regular season as the 
MLS' best team. They won their last five games and eight of the 
last nine, including a shootout victory over the Fire. The Fire and 
Burn split four games in the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	Forward Jason Kreis had an MVP-like season, leading the league  
with 18 goals and 15 assists. He won player of the week honors for 
a second straight week after scoring the game-winner in Dallas' 
last game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Really, on current form, Dallas is as good as anybody,''  
midfielder-forward Paul Dougherty said. ``Obviously, D.C. and Los 
Angeles had the best records, but Dallas' current form means a 
lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Everything starts over now. Forget the records, forget the tough  
losses. All the Fire need to remember is Pasadena, and what it took 
to get there. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe it's taken all year to get to that point, but yes,  
now we have the same hunger we had last year to win,'' Bradley 
said. ``We still believe we're a team that can win the 
championship.''

<HEADLINE> Cops Who Posed With O.J. Punished </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Two Miami-Dade police officers who posed for  
snapshots with O.J. Simpson after responding to a 911 call last 
week have been placed on desk duty and now face an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Field Training Officer Ralph De Jesus, 42, and rookie trainee  
Lonnie Allen, 29, have been relieved of patrol duty, Detective 
Vanessa Cook said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers met Simpson, 52, on Sunday after responding to a  
911 call he placed from his girlfriend's townhouse. According to a 
police report, Simpson said Christie Prody, 26, had been on a 
cocaine binge. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson later said that was a misunderstanding, and he had  
placed the call on behalf of one of Prody's friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson and Prody were having a ``verbal dispute,'' according to  
the police report. De Jesus and Allen gave Simpson a brochure on 
domestic violence. Then they posed for pictures. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Kolodgy, vice president of the Dade County Police  
Benevolent Association, said the officers might have used poor 
judgment, but he doesn't think they broke department rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson was acquitted in 1995 of murdering his ex-wife Nicole  
Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman. He later was found 
liable for their deaths in a civil trial and was ordered to pay 
$33.5 million in damages.

<HEADLINE> Mets' Henderson Ill, Leaves Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Melvin Mora had never played catch in the dugout  
during a game and he had never homered in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	Rickey Henderson's upset stomach made both possible Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Henderson was taken out of the New York Mets' playoff game with  
the Atlanta Braves in the middle of the second inning with nausea 
and light headedness. 
</P>
<P>
	With Henderson feeling sick in the outfield, Mora loosened up by  
tossing a ball in the dugout with Matt Franco. Most of the Mets 
were on the top step of the dugout as the unusual game of catch 
went on behind them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never done that. I've never ever warmed up in the  
dugout,'' Mora said. ``They told me to get loose quick because I 
might need to make a throw on a hit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They didn't need Mora's arm, but they did need his bat. In the  
fifth inning, he turned on a fastball by Kevin Millwood and hit a 
shot into the left-field seats for his first homer in either the 
regular season or postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	But it wasn't enough for the Mets, who lost 4-3 and fell behind  
2-0 in the NL Championship Series. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets could tell early Wednesday that something was wrong  
with Henderson when he wasn't jabbering with them before the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he had a migraine,'' Darryl Hamilton said ``He looked  
down. That's not Rickey. Usually he's pumping everyone up. It got 
worse in the first couple of innings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson was lying on his back in the runway behind the Mets'  
dugout with ice packs on his head before coming to bat in the 
second inning. He told manager Bobby Valentine that he had the 
stomach flu. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson was late to the on-deck circle before coming to bat  
with runners on second and third and two outs. He hit a grounder in 
the hole between first and second that second baseman Bret Boone 
fielded on the outfield grass and threw to Millwood to just get 
Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson, 0-for-6 in the series, jogged down the baseline with  
a pained expression on his face. He went out to play left field in 
the bottom of the inning, but looked ill. 
</P>
<P>
	He slowly fielded two hits to left and didn't engage in his  
usual banter with the fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``He really looked down,'' Bobby Bonilla said. ``You knew there  
was a problem when he wasn't having fun with the crowd.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With two runners on and a 2-0 count on Walt Weiss, Valentine and  
trainer Fred Hina ran out to check on Henderson. Hamilton, who was 
in center, and right fielder Roger Cedeno also came over to check 
on their teammate. 
</P>
<P>
	After a brief discussion, Henderson was taken out of the game  
and replaced by Mora. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to be ready for anything,'' Mora said. ``I never know  
when I'm going to get in the ballgame.''

improved overseas business and cost controls. But investors seized 
on the company's 4 percent growth in revenue, below analysts' 
estimates of 8 percent growth. 

</P>
<P>
 *Tyco International Inc., down 10 at 87    	
</P>
<P>
	Tyco officials held a conference call to counter rumors that the

<HEADLINE> Boise Cascade Has 3rd Good Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOISE, Idaho (AP) -- Continued strength in office and building  
supplies gave Boise Cascade Corp. a 4 percent third-quarter 
earnings increase, the company's third straight profitable quarter 
after two years of losses. 
</P>
<P>
	The wood and paper products company reported net income of $49  
million dollars, or 74 cents per share, up from $12.4 million, or 
14 cents per share, in the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The company beat analyst expectations of 70 cents a share,  
according to First Call/Thomson Financial. The company's stock was 
up 38 cents at $36.13 in New York Stock Exchange trading Thursday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 results do include a one-time $34.7 million gain from  
from an insurance settlement. When that gain is included, Boise 
Cascade earned $47.1 million, or 72 cents a share, in the 1998 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Boise Cascade's results put it in line to have its first  
profitable year since 1996. The past two years, it was hobbled by a 
drop in paper prices and restructuring costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales hit $1.79 billion, up 12 percent from $1.6 billion in the  
third quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``Growth in our distribution and engineered wood products  
businesses, effective cost controls and strong product prices led 
to significantly better performance in the third quarter,'' 
chairman George Harad said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The building product segment remained the financial bulwark of  
Boise Cascade, generating $60.2 million in operating income during 
the summer. That was off just marginally from the spring 
performance, reflecting an inventory write-down to adjust for the 
seasonal decline in prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales in office products jumped 10 percent from a year earlier,  
generating operating income of $34.8 million, slightly higher than 
during the spring and 24 percent higher than for the third quarter 
of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	And even the lagging paper segment more than doubled its  
second-quarter operating income to hit $35.3 million as lower unit 
costs and a 3 percent increase in sales offset flat prices. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of 1999, Boise Cascade earned $124.3  
million, or $2.88 a share, on $5.08 billion in sales compared to a 
loss of $25.9 million, or 75 cents a share, on $4.63 billion in 
sales a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's results reflected a $42 million restructuring  
program that executives say is now paying off.

<HEADLINE> Decision Could Save Blind Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The General Services Administration has  
temporarily reversed a decision to close eight supply facilities -- 
a move that would have taken jobs from about 1,400 blind workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The facilities, which distribute products made by the blind to  
federal agencies, were to begin closing this month. But unions for 
2,000 other federal workers at the facilities convinced the 
administration to reconsider. 
</P>
<P>
	GSA is ``turning back the clock'' to mid-May, before the  
facilities were slated to close, Administrator David Barram said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	However, GSA, the government's landlord and purchasing agent,  
has not necessarily decided to keep the depots open. The 
administration must find a way to make the facilities, which lose 
$100,000 a day, more economical, Barram said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will rejuvenate our partnerships with our unions and have  
an important, honest discussion with them to examine the problems 
and directions in our distribution system,'' he added in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Industries for the Blind, the parent organization  
for 88 advocacy groups for the blind, is not convinced GSA's 
announcement is good news. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's encouraging, but what does it mean?'' asked NIB  
spokeswoman Lou Ann Burney. ``I am not sure we know at this 
point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adhering to a 1938 law, the government gives special  
consideration to organizations that sell products -- of competitive 
price and quality -- made by the blind. This group's unemployment 
rate is more than 70 percent, advocates for the blind say. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Barram said GSA would review the closures' effect on  
blind workers and make sure ``we didn't do anything inadvertent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He expects the GSA and the unions to come to an agreement on the  
fate of the supply facilities by the end of the month.

	``If we don't get a handle on this among the states that are in  
this first-in-the-nation area and have some stability here, yes, we 
will be threatened,'' said Robinson. ``We don't want that 
uncertainty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans and Democrats use different methods to set caucus  
dates, but work together to have them on the same day. Iowa 
Democrats must win approval from the national party's rules 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect that to happen,'' Democratic Secretary of State Chet  
Culver said at a separate news conference. ``I don't want to have 
to go through this again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa Republicans are free to set their date without national  
party approval. 
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire officials welcomed the news.  
</P>
<P>
	``Candidates will now have a better opportunity to get their  
message out in both states,'' said Jayne Marcucci, executive 
director of the New Hampshire Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire Democratic Party Chairwoman Kathy Sullivan said  
Iowa's decision ``shows that cooler heads can prevail and that 
these things can be worked out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The move comes after days of private discussions about the 2000  
political calendar of primaries and caucuses that yield 
presidential nominees. 
</P>
<P>
	The Iowa caucuses had been set for Jan. 31, but New Hampshire  
officials unexpectedly scheduled their primary on Feb. 1. They 
refused to push it back to Feb. 8 despite the entreaties of Iowa 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan. 24 is the earliest date for the caucuses since 1980, when  
they were held Jan. 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa originally set its caucuses for Feb. 21 but that date was  
gradually moved earlier as other states set early primary and 
caucus dates in an enormously front-loaded political calendar. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisiana Republicans had planned their regional caucuses for  
Jan. 28, to be first. A Louisiana Republican official said Iowa's 
decision will cause the party to pick a new date. 
</P>
<P>
	Roughly 75 percent of the delegates will be picked by March 7,  
and both parties are virtually certain to have a nominee within six 
weeks of Iowa's opening test. 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa reached the conclusion that it had no choice but to move  
the caucus date to Jan. 24 to preserve its leadoff status, Robinson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a difficult thing and it's a terribly inconvenient  
thing,'' Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, it's a massive logistical chore. Each party will have  
to find more than 2,000 caucus sites across the state. The two 
parties also will have to reshuffle the logistics of totaling the 
votes, and there's certain to be a major hotel shortage with the 
thousands of journalists and assorted others who descend on the 
state on caucus night. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite that, the state's political leaders concluded that  
holding the caucuses the night before the New Hampshire primary 
likely would dilute their impact and jeopardize their role in the 
presidential selection process. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight between Iowa and New Hampshire is also certain to  
spark a review of the lineup for the next presidential election. In 
past election cycles the two states have banded together to fend 
off challenges from other states seeking a slice of the attention 
given to states which open the nomination process. 
</P>
<P>
	The battle will shift Friday to Washington, where New Hampshire  
and Iowa Democratic officials will meet with a national party 
committee that governs the political calendar. The panel is 
expected to approve the shift to Jan. 24, but the vote wasn't 
absolutely certain, senior Democrats in Washington said. 
</P>
<P>
	That panel could sanction states which don't follow an  
established calendar, but those sanctions are largely meaningless. 
More importantly, the panel begins meeting next month to talk about 
the lineup for the 2004 election, and members have said the fight 
this year makes it more likely the calendar will be jumbled in the 
next election cycle.

<HEADLINE> Teams Run From Packers' Brown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Last season, teams were running at  
Gilbert Brown. Now they're running away from him again. 
</P>
<P>
	His Green Bay Packers teammates and coaches say that's in  
recognition of the XXL-sized run-stopper's professional 
rejuvenation. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown has assumed added responsibilities on and off the field  
while defensive tackle Santana Dotson, his partner on the front of 
the defensive line, is out with a stinger to his right shoulder. 
Dotson has missed the Packers' last two games and likely will miss 
Sunday's game at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Ray Rhodes thinks Brown is playing as well as he did  
during the Packers' championship season of 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``His conditioning and stamina is a lot better than it ever has  
been,'' Rhodes said. ``He's fired up about playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defensive tackles are difficult to measure in statistics,  
because most of what they do occurs away from the ball. But Brown, 
known as the Gravedigger for the unique celebration dance he has 
had occasion to use several times this season, is getting noticed 
by opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tampa Bay Buccaneers avoided Brown's spot on the defensive  
line whenever possible last Sunday, and when fullback Mike Alstott 
ventured into the line, two and sometimes three blockers attacked 
Brown. No stranger to double-teams, Brown plugged half the line and 
limited the mobility of Alstott and Warrick Dunn. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they tried to cut back during the course of the game, he  
had things jammed up and they couldn't make cutback runs to his 
area,'' Rhodes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown also took on the unlikely role of team leader during Green  
Bay's win over Minnesota two weekends ago. At halftime, the usually 
taciturn Brown got up and blistered his teammates' ears with a 
profane tirade that inspired the Packers to a standout performance 
in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure everybody was looking at Gilbert and not going to  
question what he was saying,'' said Rhodes, himself no stranger to 
curse-filled motivational speeches. ``The young man went out and 
played a big-time game for us. When he was in there, he impacted 
our football team by beating double teams, making tackles and 
things of that nature.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reluctant to talk to reporters and completely intolerant of  
questions about himself and his weight, Brown usually doesn't 
appear in the media -- although he sometimes can be seen in the 
background of TV interviews with safety LeRoy Butler, whose locker 
is next to Brown's. 
</P>
<P>
	``People have kind of forgotten about him, because he's not a  
big media guy,'' Butler said. ``But he came in this locker room at 
halftime, and he fired us up. He was talking like Ray Junior, with 
a lot of bleeps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown's improved conditioning, which was a noticeable problem  
during his subpar 1998 season, has allowed him to play about 40 
snaps per game. He's not always the last player off the ground 
after a tackle, and he is getting in the backfield more frequently. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has been coming to play,'' Dotson said. ``He fills a void  
with me not being out there. He's taking care of the middle. I'm 
proud of him.''

<HEADLINE> CIA Goes to Hollywood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANGLEY, Va. (AP) -- Let you in on a little secret: The CIA has  
gone Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	By opening its doors to a movie crew to shoot a few scenes of  
``In the Company of Spies'' at its cloistered headquarters in this 
Washington suburb, the CIA reaped a rare reward -- a 
klieg-light-bright portrayal of a spy agency more accustomed to 
dark jokes about blown covers and bungled missions. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie, produced by Showtime and Paramount Network  
Television, depicts a heroic team of CIA officers and analysts who 
pull off a monumental covert operation that not only snatches one 
brave officer from the jaws of death but also saves the United 
States from nuclear disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	Oh, yes, and the acts of derring-do also avert a nasty dustup  
with the Russians. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie is scheduled to air on Showtime on Oct. 24.  
</P>
<P>
	To mark the most extensive CIA cooperation with movie makers  
ever, the agency's director, George Tenet, invited the film's stars 
-- Tom Berenger, Ron Silver and Alice Krige -- as well as CIA 
employees and a cast of Washington political luminaries to a 
screening and private reception Wednesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	``They portrayed us in a very good light,'' Tenet told  
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	His appraisal was affirmed in a spontaneous burst of applause  
from the audience at a point near the end of the movie when the 
president (played by Len Cariou) learns that the CIA effort 
succeeded in foiling a North Korean plot to import Russian missiles 
capable of striking the U.S. West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it's good, it's spectacular,'' he says of the agency.  
</P>
<P>
	The president's national security adviser, whose constant  
second-guessing of the CIA's daring plan is meant to represent the 
kind of political wishy-washiness that many believe has weakened 
the agency in recent years, responds by saying the agency's 
reputation was built on its mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lesson in that,'' the president replies. With that,  
the audience broke into applause. 
</P>
<P>
	That is precisely the message Tenet and the rest of the CIA want  
the American public to hear -- that despite its setbacks, the 
usually untold successes are what makes the agency so valuable. 
</P>
<P>
	``What Showtime has done is given us a chance to tell our  
story,'' Tenet told the audience before the screening started. He 
even made a recruiting pitch, saying he was ``not ashamed to say'' 
that young Americans who see the film should consider the 
intelligence field as a rewarding career. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Cort, one of the film's producers, said he was an analyst  
at CIA headquarters for two years in the early 1970s. He said his 
cover was that he worked for ``some obscure Army agency,'' and in 
that period he realized how little Americans know about what the 
CIA does. ``They have no idea who you people are,'' he said, 
addressing his comments to the CIA employees in the audience. 
</P>
<P>
	Tenet said he believes the movie will give Americans a more  
accurate picture of the CIA, which often is portrayed in Hollywood 
as an inept, even evil, enterprise operating beyond the White 
House's control. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are open,'' Tenet said. ``This is a new world.''  
</P>
<P>
	For the Showtime producers, the CIA provided technical advice to  
make the film more accurate and realistic, spokesman William Harlow 
said. That is the kind of cooperation the Pentagon often provides 
to Hollywood (there is even a full-time Pentagon staff to 
coordinate it), but it's new for the CIA. 
</P>
<P>
	Even in an era of more openness by the CIA, the idea of  
Hollywood stars descending on the agency's wooded compound along 
the Potomac River was remarkable -- especially for those who work 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a change of pace, an enjoyable, fun thing'' for CIA  
employees who spend most of their careers behind cloaks of 
anonymity, said Harlow, the agency's chief of public affairs. Only 
``overt'' employees like him, whose names are publicly acknowledged 
by the agency, were attending, Harlow added. 
</P>
<P>
	There was nothing cloak-and-dagger about Wednesday evening's  
screening. In the fading light of a warm autumn day, a parade of 
black limousines deposited stars on the steps of the white 
headquarters building. Television camera lights glared and news 
photographers clicked away as several cast members stopped to chat 
with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Berenger, who plays a retired CIA operative who returns to save  
the day in a crisis with North Korea, said the CIA deserves more 
credit than it generally gets. ``If they do something well and 
right you never hear about it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Chip Shortage Hikes Computer Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Consumers expecting to see ever-lowering  
computer prices as they begin their holiday shopping may be in for 
a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturers are beginning to pass on the higher costs of  
memory chips, known as RAM, to consumers, who have been seeking 
more and more powerful chips as they go after faster computers with 
the best graphics. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty-four megabytes of RAM -- a typical amount of memory in a  
$1,000 computer -- once sold for as low as $40. Now the same memory 
is retailing for about $100 and could reach $150 next month, 
analysts said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``About 7 percent of the cost of desktop PCs is memory, and when  
a manufacturer sees that suddenly double, you can bet they're going 
to react,'' said Steve Cullen, principal memory analyst at In-Stat 
market research. ``Those days when (memory chip) prices were coming 
down, down, down are over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	RAM is important to a computer because it stores information  
that a processor might need at another point, allowing a user and 
the computer to more rapidly switch back and forth between tasks 
for everything from screensavers to spreadsheets to games. Even the 
fastest processors are slow at performing multiple tasks without 
adequate RAM. 
</P>
<P>
	Supplies in the last several months have been constrained for a  
variety of reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturers shuttered or sharply reduced production in many  
factories in the Far East last year after a 3 1/2-year glut caused 
prices to fall to a record low, and new supplies of a super-fast 
RAM chips with double the current greatest speed has been slowed by 
glitches. 
</P>
<P>
	The most recent blow to the industry came with the 7.6 magnitude  
earthquake in Taiwan last month that either destroyed factories or 
threw sophisticated machines out of calibration, said analyst 
Sherry Garber at Semico Research Corp. Taiwan produces 12 percent 
to 15 percent of the world's RAM chips. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturers, meantime, have been competing in the cutthroat  
industry by offering consumers computers with more and more memory 
at lower and lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``So you've gone from a situation where the supply-and-demand  
scenario was just about in balance to one where as much as 15 
percent of world production is lost, at least for a week,'' said 
Cullen. ``That means computers will either be on stores shelves 
with less memory at the same prices, add-on memory will cost more -- 
if its even available -- or overall computer prices will be 
higher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst Rob Enderle at research firm Giga Information Group also  
noted that prices of trendy new flat-screen computer panels, 
personal digital assistants and newer cellular phones also are 
likely to increase because of the Taiwan quake. 
</P>
<P>
	``The real effects of the quake are not going to be known for  
months, but Taiwan has become an important producer of all kinds of 
components for everything from actual computers to cars,'' Enderle 
said. ``The message for the consumer is that if they're looking at 
buying a low-cost machine, they'd better buy it pretty darn 
quick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The situation could get worse before it gets better. Worldwide  
sales of computer chips are expected to grow 14 percent to more 
than $155 billion in 1999, according to a forecast released 
Thursday by Dataquest, the Santa Clara, Calif.-based research unit 
of the Gartner Group consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
	The annual double-digit sales growth will continue through 2002,  
driven by a strong global economy, Dataquest said. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer manufacturers in recent weeks have acknowledged the  
short-term outlook looks troublesome. 
</P>
<P>
	Shoppers searching for add-on memory at Dell Computer Corp.'s  
Web site were met this week with a message that memory add-ons are 
``currently unavailable due to worldwide constraints.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Which makes sense since (computer manufacturers) are taking  
all the memory they have so they can ship full systems,'' Garber 
said. ``Upgrades are going to be very difficult to get.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq Computer Corp. on Thursday warned retailers to expect  
delays on shipments of some products, and Hewlett-Packard Co. two 
weeks ago also said it expected delays and disruptions. Both 
companies blamed the earthquake.

<HEADLINE> GM Earns $877 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Thanks to strong sales in the United States and a  
return of labor peace, General Motors Corp. earned $877 million in 
the third quarter, reversing a loss from last year's strike-plagued 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's largest automaker reported Thursday that it earned  
$1.33 a share in the quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with a loss 
of $309 million, or 52 cents a share, a year earlier, after 
excluding earnings from GM's former parts unit, Delphi Automotive 
Systems. Delphi, the world's largest automotive parts maker, was 
split off from GM in May as an independent company. 
</P>
<P>
	The results beat the prediction of $1.24 a share by 13 Wall  
Street analysts, according to a survey by First Call/Thomson 
Financial. GM stock initially rose 2 percent on the news, but was 
down 25 cents at $64.87 1/2 a share in late trading on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales totaled $42.8 billion, compared with adjusted revenue of  
$33.5 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were ``a little better than expected,'' said Merrill  
Lynch analyst John Casesa. ``As has been the case for many 
quarters, the North American operations have been driving the 
results.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GM's North American operations earned $671 million, compared  
with a loss of $595 million in the July-September period of 1998. 
GM president G. Richard Wagoner said the division had its best 
quarter of the decade ``despite continuing intense competitive 
pressures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company's earnings in the third quarter of 1998 were wiped  
out by strikes at two parts plants in Flint, Mich., which cost the 
company's North American division an estimated $965 million, or 
$1.48 a share, after taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's U.S. vehicle sales are up 11.4 percent over last year, and  
during the quarter GM had 28.9 percent of the U.S. market for light 
vehicles, a category that includes cars, minivans, sport utility 
vehicles and small pickups. The automaker has struggled to regain 
market share since last summer's strikes virtually halted GM's 
North American production. It accounted for about 31 percent of the 
market before the strike. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said earnings in Europe totaled $32 million, down  
from $50 million last year. In Latin America, Africa and the 
Mideast, GM's losses narrowed from $64 million in the third quarter 
of 1998 to $36 million in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Asia-Pacific region, GM reported a loss of $54 million  
for the quarter, compared to a break-even quarter in 1998. The 
company said the depressed market in Japan held down profits. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's chief financial officer, J. Michael Losh, said the company  
would have to rely on cost-cutting to improve profits for now 
because competition for sales of cars is preventing significant 
price increases. GM said its average price increase was 0.4 percent 
in North America in the third quarter, after taking manufacturer's 
incentives into account. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're planning on an environment, whether here, Europe, South  
America or Asia, where the market won't let you take much price so 
you have to find cost reductions,'' Losh said. 
</P>
<P>
	Losh said he could not estimate the cost of GM's new four-year  
contract with the United Auto Workers. The company did say it took 
a $30 million charge against earnings to cover Delphi workers who 
choose to retire with GM pensions. 
</P>
<P>
	GMAC reported earnings of $393 million for the quarter, an  
increase of 26 percent over last year. GM said GMAC's mortgage 
business and assets in North America grew during the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of 1999, GM's worldwide operating  
earnings totaled $4.45 billion, or $6.67 a share -- nearly three 
times greater than last year's total of $1.18 billion, or a $1.87 a 
share. Revenue totaled $130 billion, up 17.5 percent from $110 
billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's Hughes Electronics unit lost $29.6 million, compared with a  
profit of $3 million last year, mainly because of expenses from its 
acquisition of two satellite-TV rivals and higher satellite costs. 
Hughes runs the nation's largest satellite TV service. 
</P>
<P>
	GM said it had $16.7 billion in cash at the end of the quarter,  
compared to $10.3 billion last year. The company also said it had 
bought 5.7 million shares of its own stock during the past three 
months at a cost of $386 million, part of a $4 billion 
stock-buyback program.

<HEADLINE> Paroled Murderer Passes Bar Exam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- A paroled murderer whose admission to law school  
was criticized by lawyers and state officials has passed the 
Arizona bar exam on his second attempt. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no guarantee James Hamm will be allowed to practice law  
in the state. He still must clear ``character and fitness'' 
scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	``I recognize I am an unpopular person. That shouldn't end the  
discussion,'' Hamm said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Character and Fitness Committee, an advisory committee  
appointed by the state Supreme Court, recommends whether an 
applicant should be admitted. The high court has the final say. 
</P>
<P>
	While felons can be considered for admission, only five or six  
have cleared the character and fitness process during the past 15 
years. None were convicted of first-degree murder as Hamm was, said 
Arizona Supreme Court spokesman John MacDonald. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamm, who pleaded guilty to the execution-style shooting of  
Willard Morely Jr. during a drug deal 25 years ago, has been the 
subject of much controversy since he was admitted to Arizona State 
University's law school. 
</P>
<P>
	Last December, ASU hired Hamm to teach two spring courses on  
criminal justice but a public outcry caused officials to assign him 
to other duties. Hamm said he gave a lecture on rehabilitation 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Arizona Attorney General Grant Woods said allowing Hamm  
to become a lawyer ``means we no longer have standards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be outrageous if he was given two second's  
consideration to be admitted,'' Woods said. ``The reason we have a 
character and fitness board is to set minimum standards for new 
lawyers. I would think we could start with excluding murderers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hamm remains on lifetime parole, which could hamper him as a  
lawyer because of restrictions on his contact with prisoners and 
parolees. He has asked the Arizona Board of Executive Clemency to 
reconsider his parole. 
</P>
<P>
	The 50-year-old prisoner-rights advocate was among 436 people  
who passed the semiannual exam in July. Hamm has until July 2004 -- 
five years from the exam -- to submit his character and fitness 
application, MacDonald said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamm said he anticipates doing so within six months: ``I am  
really serious about taking (this) one step at a time.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mixed; Dow Down 5.70 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed in early trading today as  
investors tried to reconcile two conflicting forces -- strong 
corporate earnings and soaring bond yields. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones  
industrial average was down 5.70 at 10,226.46. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were slightly higher. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index was up 2.57 at 1,288.12, and the Nasdaq composite 
index was up 15.41 at 2,816.68. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks initially fell today after the Commerce Department issued  
what appeared to be a moderate report on September retail sales. 
Total retail sales rose to a seasonally adjusted $253.4 billion, a 
gain of just 0.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But excluding the volatile automobile category, retail sales  
rose a brisk 0.6 percent in September. Many analysts were expecting 
a 0.5 percent gain. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, the Labor Department said the number of  
Americans filing for unemployment benefits last week fell by an 
unexpected 29,000 to 285,000. Economists believe that jobless 
claims levels under 300,000 are an indication of an extremely tight 
labor market. 
</P>
<P>
	Both reports heightened fears that the Federal Reserve will  
raise interest rates for the third time this year in an effort to 
keep inflation from escalating. The Fed's Open Market Committee 
will hold its next meeting on Nov. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	But after two days of sharp losses on Wall Street, a handful of  
robust earnings reports lifted stocks. After releasing earnings 
that beat analysts' expectations, Apple soared 7 25/32 to 71 13/16, 
boosting the technology-dominated Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Boeing rose 1 11/16 to 42 3/16 after reporting its  
third-quarter profits rose 37 percent as its commercial aircraft 
division continued its recovery from costly production problems. 
Boeing earned 52 cents per share in the quarter, beating analysts' 
estimates by 3 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 4-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 101.68 million 
shares, slightly behind Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index rose 0.46 to 419.78.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.2 percent as  
investors welcomed news of a merger between Sumitomo Bank and 
Sakura Bank. The deal that will create the world's second-largest 
bank. 
</P>
<P>
	In Europe, Germany's DAX index was down 0.6 percent, Britain's  
FT-SE 100 was down 0.1 percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 0.2 
percent in afternoon trading.

<HEADLINE> Guilty Pleas in '96 Campaign Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Two officials of the Cabazon Band of Mission  
Indians pleaded guilty Thursday to illegally routing thousands of 
dollars in tribal money to the 1996 Clinton-Gore re-election 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Nichols and Greg Cervantes, both non-Indians, pleaded  
guilty to misdemeanor federal charges of using tribal money to make 
illegal ``conduit'' campaign donations-- contributions made in the 
name of someone who is then reimbursed the money, said Thom Mrozek, 
a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a scheme hides the true source of the money and allows  
donors to get around campaign contribution limits. In this case, 
the true and unwitting donor was the Cabazon Band, Mrozek said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nichols, chief executive officer of the Cabazon Band, pleaded  
guilty to three counts of causing the donations. Cervantes, 
director of special affairs for the tribe, pleaded to one. 
</P>
<P>
	They admitted to a scheme involving donations to Clinton-Gore  
during 1994 and 1995, according to U.S. Attorney Alejandro 
Mayorkas' office. 
</P>
<P>
	Nichols admitted to persuading five people, including Cervantes,  
to write $1,000 checks to the Clinton/Gore campaign. He then 
reimbursed them with tribe money. 
</P>
<P>
	Cervantes admitted he wrote one $1,000 check to the Clinton/Gore  
campaign, persuaded three family members to do the same and used 
$4,000 in tribe money for reimbursements. 
</P>
<P>
	Nichols faces three years' probation and $256,000 in fines. U.S.  
District Judge Audrey Collins could also order him to serve one 
year in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Cervantes faces $39,000 in fines but no jail time.

<HEADLINE> Tyco Stock Plunges 6 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EXETER, N.H. (AP) -- Shares in Tyco International Ltd. continued  
to fall Thursday even as the company denied it had engaged in 
questionable accounting practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Criticisms from a single investment manager sparked rumors on  
Wall Street Wednesday, sending Tyco's stuck plunging more than 6 
percent. The slide continued Thursday, when its price fell $8.37 1/2, 
or nearly 9 percent, to $88.62 1/2 in afternoon trading in trading on 
the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	David Tice, a Dallas fund manager and prominent short-seller,  
recently criticized Tyco's accounting practices during its $30 
billion acquisition spree over the last three years, the New York 
Times reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Tice said Tyco disguised a decline in cash flow by delaying some  
payments and taking overly large charges to make future earnings 
look higher. He stopping short of accusing the company of illegal 
accounting practices, but said it was trying to make itself look 
better. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyco, a manufacturing and service conglomerate based in Bermuda  
but managed from Exeter, called the rumors ``unfounded and 
malicious'' in a statement released Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyco chairman and chief executive Dennis Kozlowski said the  
company would ask federal and exchange regulators to investigate 
the source of the rumors and take appropriate action. 
</P>
<P>
	Kozlowski also said Tyco's earnings for the next quarter, set to  
be released Oct. 21, would exceed analysts' expectations of 89 
cents a share.

<HEADLINE> Policy on Fining Doctors Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A physicians group is backing away from a  
controversial plan to penalize its doctors $250 daily for each day 
a patient is hospitalized when ``not medically necessary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fine, which had been scheduled to take effect Nov. 1,  
outraged many of the 350 physicians in the Mount Auburn Cambridge 
Independent Practice Association Inc., a network of doctors that 
contract with HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
	But a statement from the association said the policy would be  
delayed ``to give us more time for further discussion and education 
of our members.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The statement also said the policy, described in a front-page  
story in Thursday's Boston Globe, had been ``carefully reviewed by 
medical leadership'' before being adopted. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our intent remains the same -- to try to improve the quality  
and value of care we deliver to patients,'' the statement said. 
``We believe that the practice of good medicine requires us to be 
mindful of our limited resources. We believe good medicine should 
also be efficient and effective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Rob Janett, medical director of the practice, did not return  
repeated calls for comment about the turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
	According to an internal memorandum about the policy obtained by  
the Globe, the fines would be levied after case managers identified 
hospital stays they thought were unnecessarily long. The case 
managers would call the patient's doctor and suggest alternative 
treatments. In the case of a dispute, a committee of Mount Auburn 
doctors would decide whether the doctor should be docked. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a sad comment on how far downhill the health care  
system has gone that some doctors might think this was OK,'' said 
Dr. David Himmelstein, an internist in the group. ``There's no 
question that when you put doctors under pressure to get their 
patients out (of the hospital), there will be mistakes made 
eventually and it will harm someone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Michael Grodin, who heads the medical ethics program at  
Boston University, called the plan ``among the stupidest things 
I've seen in a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's based on an assumption that doctors and patients together  
are somehow trying to work the system so they can stay in the 
hospital longer,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Reno To Discuss Crime in Moscow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno will discuss  
computer crime and money laundering in Moscow next week with 
justice and interior ministers from the eight major industrialized 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
	At the third such meeting of the so-called G-8 ministers, Reno  
also will renew her efforts to get all of these countries to 
authorize extradition of their citizens when they are charged with 
crimes in other countries, her aides said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will discuss a whole range of issues, including high-tech  
crime, extradition issues and matters that recognize that crime is 
becoming international ... and that we have got to work together'' 
Reno told her weekly news conference Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and Russia are investigating allegations of  
massive Russian money laundering through the Bank of New York. 
Justice officials said the group talks would not focus on 
particular crimes, but rather on how to counteract the use of the 
Internet by criminals to commit a wide range of crimes, such as 
threats and fraud, from remote locations. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno will suggest that other nations copy the U.S. Electronic  
Communications Privacy Act, which allows law enforcement to quickly 
get Internet service providers to preserve their tracking records, 
officials said. These records usually would be discarded during the 
weeks it can take an international request to trace a computer 
hacker to arrive in another country. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno will meet individually with her counterparts Monday. The  
ministers, from Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, 
Russia and the United States, will meet together Tuesday and 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The first such meeting was held here in 1997. Last year, they  
met through an international video teleconference.

<HEADLINE> Cincinnati Stands by Gun Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Despite misgivings by some on City Council,  
Cincinnati will appeal a judge's ruling that threw out the city's 
lawsuit against the firearms industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The council voted 5-4 Wednesday to pursue the case before the  
1st Ohio District Court of Appeals. Judge Robert Ruehlman of the 
Hamilton County Common Pleas Court dismissed the lawsuit Oct. 7, 
ruling that it was vague or not supported by law or prior court 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	The city plans to appeal soon, said Donald Lewis of the city  
solicitor's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Council voted 5-4 in February to authorize the lawsuit and any  
appeals necessary. It would have taken another vote by the council 
to stop the process. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was filed against gun manufacturers, a distributor  
and three trade associations. It demanded reimbursement for the 
costs of providing police, emergency, court and prison services for 
shootings in the city, whether they were homicides, suicides or 
accidents. The suit did not request a specific amount of damages. 
</P>
<P>
	It also sought to force changes in the design, distribution and  
advertising of guns nationally. 
</P>
<P>
	Seventeen other lawsuits representing 27 city or county  
governments have been filed against the gun industry. The 
Cincinnati suit was the first to be dismissed.

<HEADLINE> Kobe Bryant Out With Broken Hand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Los Angeles Lakers guard Kobe Bryant  
will be sidelined at least six weeks after breaking his right hand 
in the first quarter of the team's first exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant's hand was hit by an errant elbow as he went for a  
rebound in Wednesday night's 88-84 to the Washington Wizards. He 
continued to play and 18 points, five assists, four steals and no 
turnovers in 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``He played the rest of the game, didn't realize it was broken  
until this morning and complained of pain,'' team spokesman John 
Black said. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors examined Bryant's hand in Los Angeles on Thursday and  
X-rays revealed he had broken the fourth metacarpal bone, Black 
said. He was fitted with a cast to just below his elbow, which 
he'll wear for about two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll be working out as of today, doing conditioning and  
stuff, working on his left-handed jump shot and hook shot,'' Black 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant's injury occurred the same day the Lakers signed free  
agent guard Ron Harper to a two-year, $4.2 million contract. 
Harper, a starter on three NBA title teams in Chicago, is expected 
to provide the Lakers' backcourt with experience in coach Phil 
Jackson's triangle offense. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, center Travis Knight has a severely sprained right  
ankle and is expected to miss 3-4 weeks, Black said. He will be 
re-evaluated on a weekly basis.

<HEADLINE> FBI Cameras May Have Waco Footage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The FBI had closed-circuit cameras surrounding the  
Branch Davidian compound that may have captured footage of the 1993 
standoff never seen by the public, The Dallas Morning News reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Government documents obtained by the newspaper show that at  
least five FBI agents were sent to the compound near Waco to 
maintain closed-circuit cameras during the standoff and 
specifically on April 19, the day federal agents launched an 
assault against the compound. 
</P>
<P>
	Later that day, the Davidian compound erupted in flames. About  
80 members of the cult, including leader David Koresh, died. Law 
enforcement officials insist the Davidians started the fire. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's conduct at Waco has come under renewed scrutiny  
from Congress and a special counsel appointed by Attorney General 
Janet Reno following the FBI's belated admission that its agents 
fired potentially incendiary tear-gas canisters in the hours before 
flames consumed the Davidians' retreat. 
</P>
<P>
	The videotapes may help to answer some of the lingering  
questions. The FBI has long denied that its agents fired any shots 
during the siege, and bureau officials have said rules of 
engagement did not permit deadly force against unarmed Davidians. 
</P>
<P>
	The records obtained by the newspaper contain written statements  
from FBI agents and technicians that recordings were made, even 
though no such videotape from the surveillance cameras has ever 
been released. 
</P>
<P>
	``CCTV (closed-circuit TV) monitoring sites ... were all around  
the compound,'' one agent stated in a June 1993 interview detailed 
in a three-page document. ``This enabled observers to see 
everything that was going on at the compound without showing 
themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional investigators refused to reveal details about the  
cameras because the matter involves government secrets, the News 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until that information is declassified, we cannot discuss  
it,'' said Mark Corallo, spokesman for the House Government Reform 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	An FBI spokesman also refused to comment, saying he would need  
to look into the matter first. A Justice Department spokesman did 
not return calls.

<HEADLINE> Mets' Rogers Falls Apart in Sixth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- In Kenny Rogers' first trip to the postseason,  
the New York Yankees overcame his ineffectiveness. This time, the 
New York Mets haven't been able to do it. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers held Atlanta scoreless for five innings before falling  
apart in the sixth to lose for the second time in this year's 
playoffs, 4-3 to the Braves on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	He has actually pitched better than he did in 1996 for the  
Yankees, when he was unable to go longer than three innings in any 
of his three starts -- games the Yankees eventually came back to 
win. 
</P>
<P>
	But just like in Game 2 against Arizona, which knocked him out  
in 4 1-3 innings, Rogers was saddled with the loss. He fell to 0-2 
with a 10.26 ERA in five postseason starts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's history,'' Rogers said after the Mets went down 2-0 in  
the NL championship series. ``Every game is over. I don't look back 
on other postseasons. I don't think that's a good barometer. These 
two starts could have been better, but I don't think I pitched 
badly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For five innings, it looked like this would be the time Rogers  
would come up big in the big game. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers allowed six singles and two walks through five innings,  
using a tricky pickoff move that caught two runners and an 
effective sinker that led to two double plays. New York held a 2-0 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
	It all went wrong in the sixth.  
</P>
<P>
	After Chipper Jones worked a nine-pitch walk with one out, Brian  
Jordan hit an opposite-field drive that bounced off the screen on 
the right-field foul poll, tying the game at 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``What are you going to do?'' Rogers asked. ``It was a changeup  
outside. He hit it out. I was surprised it went out, but he hit it 
solid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andruw Jones then lined a single to left field. Manager Bobby  
Valentine and pitching coach Dave Wallace conferred in the dugout 
and chose not to bring in Turk Wendell, who had been warming up 
most of the inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers thought he was done. And he was, just as soon as Eddie  
Perez hit the next pitch into the left-field seats to give the 
Braves a lead they wouldn't give up. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had no reason to keep him in,'' Valentine said. ``I left him  
in and it was absolutely the wrong move.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine threw down his hat in the dugout and kicked at it in  
disgust. Rogers, forced out of New York two years ago because of 
his big-game failings, dejectedly walked off the mound. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't look at it as a terrible day, although I'm sure  
everyone else will,'' Rogers said. ``We kind of fell apart there 
and we couldn't recover quickly enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They came close in the eighth when Edgardo Alfonzo's RBI double  
closed New York to 4-3. John Rocker struck out John Olerud and 
Robin Ventura with the tying run on second base to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Olerud, Mike Piazza and Ventura -- the middle of the Mets' lineup  
-- went 0-for-10 and are 1-for-21 in the series. 
</P>
<P>
	``They pitched us well all year,'' Darryl Hamilton said.  
``They're not really doing anything different now. It's just 
magnified in the playoffs. We have to find a way to hit them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And soon. The Mets need to win four of the next five games to  
advance to the World Series -- and a possible Subway Series matchup 
with the Yankees -- against a Braves team that has won 11 of 14 
against New York this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not over yet,'' said Alfonzo, the second baseman who made  
his first fielding error on a grounder all season in the sixth 
inning. ``We have a lot of confidence in this team. It's just tough 
for us right now.''

he was an entrepreneur. Patsy Paugh and John Ramsey fell in love, 
married and began a family. 
</P>
<P>
	Business flourished and their family life blossomed amid a close  
circle of friends. After a decade of personal and professional 
prosperity, tragedy struck in 1992, when one of Ramsey's daughters 
from his first marriage, Elizabeth, was killed in a car accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Tragedy struck a second time the next year, when Mrs. Ramsey was  
diagnosed with an advanced stage of ovarian cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ramseys persevered, armed with their religious faith.  
</P>
<P>
	Then in 1996, a third tragedy thrust the family into a spotlight  
that has yet to fade. Their 6-year-old daughter, JonBenet, was 
beaten and strangled. 
</P>
<P>
	While the parents have been under suspicion ever since, there  
was also evidence to back the theory that an intruder had killed 
the child beauty queen. On Wednesday, a county grand jury finished 
its 13-month investigation and a prosecutor said there was 
insufficient evidence to issue any indictments. 
</P>
<P>
	``We take no satisfaction in this result because a child killer  
remains free and undetected,'' the Ramseys said in a statement. 
``The Ramsey family lives in a nightmare. There has been no end to 
the public lynching and speculation which marred this case from the 
beginning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The family asked that the investigation continue.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Ramseys were the kindest, most loving parents that I've  
ever met,'' former family nanny Shirley Brady said shortly after 
JonBenet was killed. ``They never hit their children. I never heard 
them even speak a harsh word to their children. It's insane to 
think that the family could do anything like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Born Dec. 29, 1956, Mrs. Ramsey is the oldest of Donald and  
Nedra Paugh's three daughters. The family was active in both church 
and school in Parkersburg, W.Va. 
</P>
<P>
	As a young girl, Mrs. Ramsey developed a reputation as a  
straight-arrow leader, who studied hard, enjoyed performing and 
frequently thought of others first. 
</P>
<P>
	In high school, Mrs. Ramsey discovered her love of beauty  
pageants, becoming first runner-up in the Miss Teen-Age West 
Virginia. She began competing for the ultimate crown of Miss 
America a few years later at West Virginia University. 
</P>
<P>
	She was a runner-up in two preliminary competitions before  
winning the Miss West Virginia title as a sophomore. At the 
national pageant, she took home a talent award and a $2,000 
scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
	Her younger sister, Pamela, was crowned Miss West Virginia in  
1980, marking the first time a set of sisters has won the state 
title. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Ramsey graduated with a degree in journalism and  
advertising and moved to Atlanta, where she met Ramsey through 
mutual friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Nebraska in 1943, Ramsey moved with his family to  
Okemos, Mich., at age 14. His father, Jay, was a decorated World 
War II pilot before becoming director of the Michigan Aeronautics 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	As a teen-ager, Ramsey competed in cross-country and played in  
the band, and nurtured a love of aviation he inherited from his 
father. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined ROTC at Michigan State University, where he also met  
his first wife, Lucinda ``Cindy'' Lou Pasch. They were married in 
1966 and moved to the Philippines, where Ramsey spent two years as 
a Navy pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	After they returned to Michigan, Ramsey earned a master's degree  
in marketing from Michigan State in 1971. He accepted an Atlanta 
sales job with an electronics engineering company in 1973, before 
eventually striking out on his own. 
</P>
<P>
	He and his wife had three children, Elizabeth, Melinda and John,  
before divorcing in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	On Nov. 15, 1980, he married Patricia Ann Paugh, 14 years his  
junior. Their first child was Burke, and then came the little girl 
Mrs. Ramsey had dreamed of, JonBenet. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1988, Ramsey founded Access Graphics in Boulder, which was  
later acquired by Lockheed Martin. Access Graphics grossed more 
than $1 billion in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	After the killing, the Ramseys moved to the Atlanta area to be  
near relatives. Ramsey quit Access Graphics, while Mrs. Ramsey 
remains a stay-at-home mother who is active in her son's life.

<HEADLINE> Another Big S.F. Quake Feared </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- There is a 70 percent chance that a large  
earthquake will shake the San Francisco Bay area in the next 30 
years, according to a new federal study released today. 
</P>
<P>
	The new conclusion: There are a number of faults slicing through  
heavily developed areas around San Francisco, more chances they 
will rupture and more people who will be affected when they do. 
</P>
<P>
	The estimate from the U.S. Geological Survey is slightly greater  
than that found by a 1990 study because it spreads the earthquake 
hazard over a much broader region. It also lowers the bar for a 
large earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
	The study lowered the definition of a large earthquake to  
magnitude 6.7 to match the strength of the 1994 Northridge quake, 
which killed 57 people and caused $20 billion in damage in Southern 
California. The 1990 study had estimated a 67 percent chance of a 
magnitude 7.0 earthquake by 2020. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole purpose of our research is to use science to  
contribute to safer communities,'' USGS geologist David Schwartz 
said. ``Although we can't predict or prevent earthquakes, we can 
all prepare for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His team of 70 scientists developed a new set of computer models  
that considered the interaction of faults. 
</P>
<P>
	The study looked at the earthquake hazard from the Pacific Ocean  
to the Sacramento Delta about 40 miles inland. The area has seen 
rapid development since 1989, when the Loma Prieta earthquake shook 
the area with a 6.9 magnitude quake just as a World Series game in 
San Francisco was about to start. That quake killed 67 people and 
caused $6 billion in damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The highest odds for a specific fault line -- 32 percent -- was on  
the Hayward-Rodgers Creek fault, which stretches from Fremont to 
Santa Rosa, cutting through the heavily populated East Bay area. 
</P>
<P>
	The southern section of the fault last ruptured in 1868. The  
northern section has not ruptured since between 1640 and 1776, 
making it overdue for a major shakeup. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Andreas fault, which runs from San Jose to north of San  
Francisco, had a 21 percent probability of a large quake. 
</P>
<P>
	The rate of large quakes was high in the late 1800s but dropped  
after the catastrophic 1906 San Francisco earthquake, probably 
because the San Andreas fault slipped so much that strain was 
reduced over most faults in the region, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
	Strain on those faults has been slowly building up and strong  
quakes began to occur in the 1980s, although not yet at the level 
of a century ago.

<HEADLINE> Jones Hired As Assistant URI Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Basketball Hall of Famer K.C. Jones, who  
starred for and later coached the Boston Celtics to two NBA titles, 
was hired Thursday by the University of Rhode Island as an 
assistant for the women's team. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, 67, most recently was head coach of the Hartford-based  
New England Blizzard of the women's American Basketball League. The 
league disbanded following the 1998-99 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I chose to take this position because I still have a passion  
for this game of basketball,'' Jones said. ``I'm not ready to give 
it up yet ... I think I still have something to offer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For its part, Rhode Island is hoping Jones will be able to help  
get the women's basketball team into shape. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhode Island was 18-63 over the past three seasons under head  
coach Linda Zemke. She was fired after the 1998-99 season and 
replaced by Linda Pearman, who recommended the hiring of Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the university administration said it wanted a  
national-level women's basketball program, I knew the first thing 
that had to be done was to put a national-level coaching staff in 
place,'' said Pearman, a former assistant to Jones with the 
Blizzard. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of Jones' contract with Rhode Island were not disclosed.  
</P>
<P>
	Jones said coaching women for two seasons gave him a new  
perspective on the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once you've seen four, five women's games, it goes beyond  
gender,'' he said. ``It's how they play. It's like `I've got to get 
an A in hustle.''' 
</P>
<P>
	``They play what you call fundamental basketball.''  
</P>
<P>
	During Jones' playing days from 1958-67, the Celtics won eight  
NBA championships. 
</P>
<P>
	He guided the Celtics to NBA titles in 1984 and 1986, coaching  
such greats as Larry Bird, Kevin McHale and Robert Parish. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in  
1989, also has been head coach of the Washington Bullets, and the 
Seattle Supersonics.

<HEADLINE> Clinton May Deal on Tobacco Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton signaled a willingness  
Thursday to negotiate with Republicans on a cigarette tax increase 
smaller than the 55 cents a pack he proposed earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	At his news conference, Clinton invited Republican congressional  
leaders to talk over the proposal as an alternative to unacceptable 
across-the-board spending cuts currently contemplated by the GOP to 
meet balanced-budget spending caps. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, they don't have to agree to raise it as much as our  
proposal, but it would help to sit down and negotiate that,'' the 
president said. ``If they don't like my offsets, what are their 
offsets? Maybe there are some other things we could agree on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also stressed the benefits of raising taxes on  
cigarettes, particularly if young people are prevented from 
starting to smoke. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know more needs to be done to get our kids off tobacco. And  
we know that raising the price of a pack of cigarettes is one of 
the best ways to do it,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Republicans and a sizable number of Democrats, particularly  
those from tobacco-growing states, adamantly oppose higher tobacco 
taxes. On principle, most Republicans oppose virtually any tax 
increase this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tax increases as a means of meeting budgetary needs have a way  
of causing higher and higher spending that never goes away,'' said 
Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the tax-writing House Ways 
and Means Committee. ``What they are saying is they want to tax and 
spend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House GOP leaders are considering holding a vote next week on  
the entire $89.7 billion net tax increase package -- including the 
tobacco tax increase -- proposed by Clinton to balance his fiscal 
2000 budget. Many Democrats likely would vote against such as 
measure, putting them on record against the tax increases. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could be very good for the president to realize that a  
large percentage of the House Democrats are not going to support 
tax increases,'' Archer said. ``Maybe that's a good way to get that 
message to the White House.''

<HEADLINE> Pacers Rookie Out for Four Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Pacers rookie Jonathan Bender broke his  
wrist in the team's exhibition game Wednesday night and will be 
sidelined 4-6 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The rookie forward was going up for a layup in the fourth  
quarter of his first NBA exhibition game when he was fouled hard by 
Chris Herron of the Denver Nuggets. 
</P>
<P>
	It first appeared the wrist was severely sprained, but further  
X-rays revealed a bone was fractured, Pacers spokesman Dave Benner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 18-year-old high school star from Mississippi was the fifth  
player selected in the June draft. He was the Toronto Raptors' top 
draft pick, and the Pacers acquired him in a draft-day trade that 
sent veteran power forward Antonio Davis to the Raptors. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-11, 200-pound Bender averaged 23.1 points in his  
senior year at Picayune High School. He even broke Michael Jordan's 
record of 30 points in the 1999 McDonald's High School All-American 
Game, one-upping him by scoring 31 points.

<HEADLINE> N.Y. Times Co. Buys Worcester Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WORCESTER, Mass. (AP) -- The Worcester Telegram &AMP; Gazette is  
being sold to the New York Times Co. for about $295 million in a 
deal that will give the Times control of newspapers in New 
England's two largest cities. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition announced Thursday, which must be approved by  
federal regulators, would place the Telegram &AMP; Gazette alongside 
The Boston Globe in the New York Times' portfolio. The Times 
purchased the Globe, the largest paper in New England, in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are delighted to be acquiring the Worcester Telegram &AMP;  
Gazette and look forward to building on its tradition of quality 
journalism and service to readers, advertisers and the Worcester 
community,'' said Russell T. Lewis, New York Times Co. president 
and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper had been owned by the Chronicle Publishing Co. of  
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis said the company's ownership of the Globe and the T&AMP;G will  
enable the Times to better serve readers and advertisers in eastern 
Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the Newspaper Guild, which represents the T&AMP;G's  
reporters, copy editors and photographers applauded the sale. 
</P>
<P>
	``The New York Times is a quality organization that has a  
longstanding reputation for its dedication to news, its business 
ethics and overall integrity,'' the union said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Telegram &AMP; Gazette is the largest paper in Worcester County,  
with a daily circulation of 107,000, and a Sunday circulation of 
134,000. The daily paper reaches 40 percent of Worcester area 
households, and the Sunday paper reaches 50 percent of homes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston Globe has daily circulation of 463,600 and 737,500 on  
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times, which had 1998 revenues of $2.9 billion,  
publishes the Globe and 21 regional newspapers along with its 
flagship, The New York Times. It also publishes three magazines, 
including Golf Digest; and operates eight network-affiliated 
television stations and two New York City radio stations. 
</P>
<P>
	It also operates nearly 50 Web sites, including nytimes.com,  
boston.com and winetoday.com as part of its digital business unit. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also announced Thursday that it earned $60 million  
in the third quarter, up 9 percent from a year ago.

<HEADLINE> 10 Percent of U.S. Households Hungry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nearly 10 percent of U.S. households are going  
hungry or don't have consistent access to adequate food, the 
Agriculture Department said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In New Mexico, 15.1 percent of households were either hungry or  
threatened with hunger from 1996 to 1998, according to a USDA 
study. 
</P>
<P>
	Mississippi, Texas, Arizona, Louisiana, Arkansas and Oregon had  
rates of 12.6 percent or higher. Overall, hunger hit at least 10 
percent of the households in 18 states, USDA said. 
</P>
<P>
	``During this, the most prosperous economy in decades, it should  
shock most Americans to learn that hunger persists and it is in 
every state,'' Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said. ``The 
problem of hunger amid America's plenty cannot and will not be 
ignored.'' 
</P>
<P>
	North Dakota had by far the smallest share of households that  
are short of food at 4.6 percent. Four other states -- 
Massachusetts, South Dakota, Delaware and Minnesota -- had rates 
below 7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, 9.7 percent of households were considered ``food  
insecure'' during the three-year period, according to USDA, which 
based its conclusions on annual household surveys conducted by the 
U.S. Census Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	The study's results generally tracked poverty rates, but there  
were a few states, including Washington, Oregon and New Hampshire, 
where the incidence of hunger was higher. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA officials said it was possible for a family to be living  
above the poverty line and still go through periods during the year 
when they were short of food. Local costs of living have an impact 
on hunger, they said, as well as family support and the 
availability of community nutrition programs. 
</P>
<P>
	There also were states with high hunger rates where use of food  
stamps was relatively low. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, participation in food stamp program has fallen by 27  
percent since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	While the drop is due largely to the strong economy and changes  
in eligibility requirements, demand has grown for food aid from 
other programs and nonprofit organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	Glickman was releasing the study Thursday in Chicago at a  
national conference of food-assistance groups.

<HEADLINE> European Stocks Mostly Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Share prices were mostly lower in Europe Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of 614 European companies was up 0.03  
points at 306.50, while the Dow Jones Euro Stoxx Index, which 
tracks 310 companies in countries that joined the single currency, 
was down 0.13 points at 321.44. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 Index was up 1.33 points at 3725.73,  
while the DJ Stoxx 50 Index was up 7.60 points at 3708.45. 
</P>
<P>
	In domestic markets, London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange  
100-Share index fell 1.2 percent to 6,039.40. Frankfurt's Xetra DAX 
index was down 1.4 percent to 5,220.29 and the Paris CAC-40 index 
fell 0.4 percent to 4,583.63. Milan's MIBtel index fell 0.7 percent 
to 32,707. 
</P>
<P>
	There were some bright spots. DaimlerChrysler rose 1.8 percent  
and Aerospatiale Matra was up 4.2 percent after the companies 
announced that DaimlerChrysler's DASA division will merge with 
France's Aerospatiale. 
</P>
<P>
	Swedish forestry shares also outperformed other European shares,  
fueled by unexpectedly low September Norscan pulp stock data. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts believed Swedish forestry share prices were benefiting  
from strong third-quarter earnings reports from the U.S. forestry 
sector. 
</P>
<P>
	In Milan, shares in Fiat were up 1.5 percent despite denials by  
the Turin carmaker that it might merge with DaimlerChrysler. 
</P>
<P>
	Speculation about a possible deal pushed Fiat shares up by 3  
percent in early trading Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Young's Future in Question </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STANFORD, Calif. (AP) -- Steve Young still believes he has a  
football future. The San Francisco 49ers aren't so sure. 
</P>
<P>
	Young's neurologist, Dr. Gary Steinberg, said today he made a  
recommendation to Young and the team about whether he should 
continue playing, but declined to reveal it at Young's request. 
</P>
<P>
	``My advice is my opinion alone,'' Steinberg said. ``There's too  
many unknowns about this, and there's an obvious concern when 
someone suffers multiple concussive incidents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steinberg said Young has shown improvement since the hit 2 1/2  
weeks ago that caused his fourth concussion in three years. 
However, Young underwent a series of neurological tests Wednesday 
and again failed to be cleared to rejoin the 49ers on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason he hasn't been cleared to play up until now is that  
it's my opinion and the opinion of the 49ers that it's in the best 
interest of Steve Young to allow his brain to recover,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	While Young viewed Steinberg's ruling Wednesday a a temporary  
setback, it comes amid signs that his family, friends and some team 
officials want him to consider retirement rather than resume 
playing and expose himself to another damaging hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``More people are suggesting the `R' word to him,'' a somber  
coach Steve Mariucci said. ``He doesn't like hearing it, but sooner 
or later he's going to need to admit it to himself, say it and 
believe that it's right. 
</P>
<P>
	``He hasn't come to that just yet, but eventually that will  
occur. I can't tell you when.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young, 38, a two-time NFL MVP who led the 49ers to their last  
Super Bowl championship in 1994, said he's taking the concerns 
about his health to heart, but doesn't think his viewpoint is that 
different from that of anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of my family and friends are saying what I'm saying: If  
there's concern, then we shouldn't do it,'' Young said. ``If there 
isn't and you can work through it and the doctor feels good about 
it, there's nothing mysterious about it. It's pretty cut and dried. 
I really want to play again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers remain wary, and they are in no hurry to see Young  
back on the field. Even if he eventually receives medical 
clearance, the 49ers probably would hold him out for several more 
weeks to make sure he's all right. 
</P>
<P>
	Mariucci said Young is still dealing with postconcussion  
symptoms of fatigue and wooziness. 
</P>
<P>
	Young, who endured two concussions in 1996 and another in the  
1997 season opener, suffered the latest one when he was leveled by 
blitzing Arizona cornerback Aeneas Williams and struck his head on 
tackle Dave Fiore's knee before slamming into the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the symptoms are lasting a little bit longer than they  
did before,'' Mariucci said. ``In previous concussions, he has 
recovered sooner. That in itself is the concern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The medical team led by Steinberg, the chief of neurosurgery at  
Stanford Medical School, will eventually either clear Young to 
resume playing or determine there are too many health risks. 
Repeated concussions can lead to premature senility and other kinds 
of brain damage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand about concussions,'' Young said. ``I'm a resident  
expert. I know I can't risk the future and I have a full life ahead 
of me. I don't want to miss any of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he's confident he'll receive clearance at some point,  
but refused to put a timetable on it. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no D-Day to it. It's an ongoing process,'' he said.

<P>
	Mariucci raised the possibility that he and general manager Bill  
Walsh might take a more active role in deciding Young's future. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not there today, but there will come a point where a  
decision has to be made,'' Mariucci said. `If it were ever to fall 
in our laps, we would make a very conservative decision. Steve's 
health is more important than anything, where we play, who's the 
backup, our Super Bowl chances, the whole thing. Steve's health is 
A-No. 1 in our decision, period.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young, in his 15th NFL season, has so far resisted the calls to  
quit, saying he still has a passion to play football. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been playing close attention, and I'm concerned about it  
just like everybody else,'' said Carolina fullback William Floyd, a 
teammate of Young on San Francisco's 1994 Super Bowl team. ``This 
is like the fourth or fifth time in as many years, and it's scary 
to think about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As much as Young wants to play, he won't ignore a recommendation  
from his doctors to quit if that's what it comes to, said his 
agent, Leigh Steinberg, who is not related to the neurologist. 
</P>
<P>
	Wide receiver Jerry Rice added he believes Young is at the point  
where he needs a resolution. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's dealing with the situation pretty well under the  
circumstances,'' Rice said. ``I don't know exactly which direction 
he's going to go, but I think he's ready to make a decision.''

	VENTURA, Calif. (AP) -- Christian law enforcement officers gather  
once a week to arrest stress: Sipping coffee and flipping through 
well-worn Bibles, they talk shop, share anxieties, read Scripture 
and bow their heads in prayer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's critical for me. I can feel the difference when I don't  
attend,'' said Sheriff's Senior Deputy William Stevens. ``It's a 
dark world out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To make policing it brighter, the Ventura County chapter of the  
Fellowship of Christian Peace Officers gathers for an hour each 
Thursday in a cafeteria meeting room in the county's Government 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Up to 35 people attend, including policemen, sheriff's deputies,  
FBI agents, game wardens and California Highway Patrol officers. 
</P>
<P>
	The group is a local chapter of the national Fellowship of  
Christian Peace Officers, an organization launched by a handful of 
Los Angeles Police Department officers in 1971. The 
nondenominational group, now based in Chattanooga, Tenn., counts 
some 4,000 members in 150 chapters. 
</P>
<P>
	At the weekly Ventura meetings, prayers are sometimes offered  
for officers and their families, for friends in crisis and for 
hospitalized cops. Topping the list at a recent meeting were a 
California Highway Patrol officer shot on a freeway 24 hours 
earlier and a Thousand Oaks police officer critically injured in a 
squad-car crash. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important to keep our fellow officers uplifted,'' said  
Vinse Gilliam, deputy chief investigator for the district 
attorney's office who led a Bible study session. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Charley Trigg, who attends the meetings twice each  
month, said they help relieve the anxiety that comes from dealing 
with crime every day. 
</P>
<P>
	``They feel the stress of a society that doesn't appreciate  
police officers in general and peace officers who put their life on 
the line each day,'' said Trigg, pastor at Oxnard's Calvary Chapel. 
</P>
<P>
	``The meetings help to encourage their individual walk with the  
Lord,'' Trigg added. ``A lot of them find it difficult sharing 
their faith with their partners or people they work with. This 
gives them a chance to reach out for their fellow officers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meetings begin with chitchat, then a prayer to ``eliminate  
baggage of the past week.'' Gilliam then offers a bit of levity 
with a religious-themed joke and Stevens talks about inspiration he 
gets from an Internet prayer chat room. 
</P>
<P>
	``We enjoy a camaraderie which cannot be imitated by anyone  
outside our unique profession,'' said the fellowship's executive 
director, C. Grant Wolf, from his Tennessee office. ``Police 
officers deal with the garbage of society. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead of people appreciating and honoring law enforcement  
officers, they are often dissed by the public. They deal with 
murders and traffic accidents where people are killed and they are 
expected to say, `Just the facts, ma'am, just the facts.' But they 
are human beings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the nature of their profession, which includes working odd  
hours, often makes it difficult for officers to get involved with 
people outside law enforcement, Wolf said. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, there are some within law enforcement who feel  
Christian officers are wimps who might hesitate to act in a 
life-or-death situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``He might say, `Oh, Lord! Should I shoot this guy or not?'''  
Wolf said, relating a fear expressed by some officers who say they 
don't want to work with Christian partners. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, he said, not all officers want to be frank and  
public about their religious beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are what we call `secret service' Christians on  
departments,'' Wolf said, ``those who feel they have to be very 
secret about their Christianity. They feel that Christianity is not 
macho enough for a peace officer.''

<HEADLINE> Calif. Senator Criticized by Son </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- A state senator sponsoring a ballot  
initiative that would ban gay marriages in California is being 
criticized by his gay son, who called the measure ``blind'' and 
``uncaring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Knight, a cabinet maker in Baltimore, wrote an opinion  
piece in the Los Angeles Times attacking Republican Pete Knight's 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe, based on my experience, that his is a blind,  
uncaring, uninformed, knee-jerk reaction to a subject about which 
he knows nothing and wants to know nothing, but which serves his 
political career,'' he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	David Knight also wrote that after he told his father three  
years ago that he is gay and has a life partner, ``my relationship 
with my father was over. I can't begin to explain the hurt that has 
come from this rejection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The senator acknowledged publicly in 1996 that his son, who like  
him is a former fighter pilot, is gay and that the senator's 
brother died of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	At that time, Knight was trying unsuccessfully to get the  
Legislature to pass a bill -- similar to his initiative on the March 
7 ballot -- to block recognition of gay marriages performed in other 
states. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight has said he and his son disagree on gay marriages but  
respect each other's views. 
</P>
<P>
	``I regret that my son felt he needed to force a private, family  
matter into the public forum through an editorial,'' he said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although I don't believe he was fair in describing the true  
nature of our relationship, that is a subject which should remain 
between the two of us. I care deeply about my son.''

<HEADLINE> Honeywell 3Q Earnings Rise 15 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Honeywell Inc. said Thursday its  
third-quarter earnings rose 15 percent, due largely to strong 
performance in its home and building control division. 
</P>
<P>
	The company earned $166.6 million, or $1.28 per share, for the  
quarter ending Oct. 3, compared with $145.4 million, or $1.14 a 
share, in the third quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Minneapolis-based maker of security, energy-management and  
other control technologies for buildings, homes, industry, space 
and aviation had sales of $2.2 billion, up 4 percent from $2.12 
billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the 19th consecutive quarter, Honeywell has delivered  
solid double-digit earnings growth,'' said Michael Bonsignore, 
Honeywell chairman and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonsignore said the pending merger with AlliedSignal Inc. will  
contribute to per-share earnings growth of 20 percent or better 
next year for the new company. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our merger integration planning is on track,'' he said, and  
the company expects to save $250 million next year because of the 
merger. 
</P>
<P>
	Honeywell and New Jersey-based AlliedSignal got shareholder  
approval during the quarter for their planned merger. They also 
agreed to divest some of their aviation electronics businesses to 
win clearance from the U.S. Department of Justice. The companies 
are now working to get approval from the European Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months, Honeywell earned $412.4 million, or  
$3.20 per share, up 12 percent from $367.5 million, or $2.87, a 
year ago. Sales were up 4 percent to $6.32 billion from $6.07 
billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Honeywell shares closed up $1.56 1/4, at $110.31 1/4, on the New York  
Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Unisys Reports $138.4 Profit in 3Q </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLUE BELL, Pa. (AP) -- Unisys Corp. reported a 72 percent  
increase in third-quarter profit as improved overseas business and 
cost controls offset declines in computer networking and sales to 
the U.S. government. But the company's stock price tumbled 29 
percent amid investor disappointment with its revenue growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Unisys earned $138.4 million, or 43 cents per share, up from  
$93.8 million, or 25 cents a share, during the same period a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The results reflect a $22 million, or 7 cents per share, gain  
from a tax benefit and a $12.1 million, or 4 cents per share, 
charge for debt retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues grew 4 percent to $1.87 billion from $1.79 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	The earnings figures beat expectations of Wall Street analysts,  
according to First Call/Thomson Financial. But analysts were 
expecting 8 percent revenue growth, and Wall Street punished Unisys 
for the shortfall by sending its stock price falling sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	Unisys shares fell $15.68 3/4 to $26.56 1/4 in trading on the New York  
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Unisys reported better-than-expected sales from its technology  
segment, which includes its computer systems business. It also had 
improved operating profits in its services businesses. Recovering 
economies overseas gave Unisys improved growth in international 
markets, particularly in Japan and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the company suffered declines in its sales to the U.S.  
government due to pricing pressure and delays in some contracts. It 
also reported weakness in its network services business that, along 
with the effects of a weaker dollar, hurt revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	Unisys said its revenues were below its own expectations.  
</P>
<P>
	The company reported success from cost control steps, including  
the retirement of preferred stock and debt that reduced interest 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of the year, Unisys earned $366.3  
million, or $1.13 per share, up from $240.7 million, or 60 cents 
per share, in the same period of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose to $5.58 billion from $5.19 billion.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Profit Rises 37 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Boeing Co.'s third-quarter profits rose 37 as its  
commercial aircraft division continued its recovery from costly 
production problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The aerospace company today reported net earnings of $477  
million, or 52 cents a share, compared to profits of $347 million, 
or 36 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenues rose 4 percent to 
$13.28 billion from $12.72 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Profits were slightly higher than the consensus estimate of 49  
cents a share by analysts surveyed by First Call. 
</P>
<P>
	In Boeing's key commercial aircraft segment, operating earnings  
were $501 million on revenues of $8.5 billion, compared with a loss 
of $142 million on revenues of $7.8 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing delivered 142 jetliners in the quarter and 455 in the  
first nine months of the year, compared with 368 in the first nine 
months of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997 and 1998, Boeing was beset with production line snarls,  
delayed deliveries and the Asian financial crisis. Overall, it lost 
$178 million in 1997 and had depressed earnings of $1.1 billion in 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Condit, Boeing chairman and chief executive officer, said  
the company was able to make significant cost improvements on two 
new aircraft programs, the next-generation 737 and widebody 777. 
Improved world economic conditions also will allow sustained 
production of one of Boeing's more profitable planes, the jumbo 
747-400. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are realizing significant performance improvement in  
production and are confident in our ability to deliver about 620 
commercial airplanes this year,'' Condit said. ``Due in part to the 
improved Asian economy, we are able to maintain 747 production rate 
at two per month through 2000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Profits for the quarter ended Sept. 30 included a one-time gain  
of $59 million or 7 cents a share from the sale of Boeing 
Information Services, and a gain of $41 million or 4 cents a share 
associated with the sale of shares from an initial public stock 
offering by an insurer. In addition, Boeing also took a previously 
announced, one-time charge of $141 million or 15 cents a share due 
to a lack of orders for its F-15 fighter. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding non-recurring items in both years, third-quarter  
earnings per share were 56 cents in 1999 and 30 cents in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of 1999, profits were $1.65 billion or  
$1.76 a share, compared to $655 million, or 67 cents a share, a 
year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues were $42.79 billion, up 10 percent from $39.06 billion  
in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Williams Wins Another Big Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Like a familiar tune he couldn't get out of his  
head, Bernie Williams kept thinking about 1996 and the first game 
of another American League Championship Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Extra innings. Williams leading off for the New York Yankees.  
Home run to win the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was all I was thinking about the inning before,''  
Williams said after repeating the feat with a 10th-inning homer to 
defeat the Boston Red Sox 4-3 Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	When Paul O'Neill made the final out in the bottom of the ninth,  
sending the game into extra innings, Williams knew the situation 
was the same as it was in 1996 against Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Paul grounded out, it was kind of like a set-up for the  
same situation that I had in 1996,'' the soft-spoken slugger said. 
``I tried to keep it off my mind because it is a different pitcher, 
different team, but the set-up is sort of the same. But what are 
the chances of it happening twice?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quite good, actually.  
</P>
<P>
	Williams took a fastball for a strike, and when Boston reliever  
Rod Beck tried to sneak another one by him, the Yankees cleanup man 
sent it into the center-field bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
	Was it just a lucky guess?  
</P>
<P>
	``No, not really,'' Williams said. ``If I would have been  
guessing, I probably would have pulled it foul. The last time I 
faced him, he threw me a pitch off the plate inside and broke my 
bat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the way to approach it is just to stay inside and not  
try to pull it, and that's what I did. I tried to stay inside the 
ball and hit it with the good part of the bat and put my hips into 
it, and it went out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was not Williams' plan. Leading off the inning, he said he  
just wanted to get on base, start a rally. Instead, he ended the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	At first, Boston center fielder Darren Lewis looked like he  
might have a chance to catch the ball. Certainly, Williams thought 
so. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think it would be gone,'' he said. ``He had his back  
to me. I figured he'd play it off the wall. When it went out, I was 
so surprised. It was unbelievable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Almost as unbelievable as Williams still playing for the  
Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	He was as good as gone last winter, prepared to sign as a free  
agent with the Red Sox. Manager Joe Torre was already forming 
contingency plans for his lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really didn't pay attention to where he was going,'' Torre  
said. ``My concern was he wasn't going to be with us. We had to 
look and see where our production was going to come from. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were talking to Albert Belle. You hear so many rumors on  
where he is going. He's going to this club, to that club, going to 
Arizona, going to Baltimore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre said Williams told him he wanted to come back to New York.  
But Boston was hot on his trail. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very close,'' Williams said. ``There were a lot of  
conversations. I have nothing but good things to say about them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the last minute, though, the Yankees swept in and signed the  
slugger. He enjoyed a big season, batting batting .342 with 25 home 
runs and a career-high 115 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	And the best part was Torre no longer had to worry about where  
the production was coming from. 
</P>
<P>
	Especially in extra innings of ALCS playoff games.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Praises NCAA Champs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton noted the death of  
basketball great Wilt Chamberlain on Thursday as he heaped praise 
on the national champion Connecticut men's and Purdue women's 
basketball teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``On Monday, we lost one of the greatest basketball players of  
all time,'' Clinton said at a White House ceremony honoring the 
1999 NCAA champions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wilt Chamberlain once said, in a rather wry and funny way,  
`They say that nobody is perfect. Then they tell you practice makes 
perfect. I wish they'd make up their minds,''' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``One thing is clear. With practice and talent, UConn and Purdue  
got pretty close to perfect,'' added Clinton, who received 
basketball jerseys from the two teams. The UConn team also gave the 
president a championship ring. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has made an annual ritual out of honoring the national  
college basketball champions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of a joke around the White House that I'm a  
basketball fanatic,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	UConn beat the Duke Blue Devils, 77-74, on March 29. The Huskies  
finished the season 33-2. 
</P>
<P>
	The Purdue Boilermakers, who finished 34-1, won their first  
national title with a come-from-behind 62-45 victory over Duke. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those at the ceremony were the parents of Tiffany Young, a  
member of the Purdue team killed in August when her car was hit by 
a drunken driver. Young would have been a senior for the 
Boilermakers this season.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon: U.S. Allies Lagging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An important lesson of NATO's war over Kosovo  
is that America's allies need to modernize their forces and make 
them more compatible with those of the United States, Defense 
Secretary William Cohen and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Henry 
Shelton said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon leaders also told the Senate Armed Services  
Committee that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization must set more 
clear-cut procedures for deciding early in an armed conflict which 
kinds of targets can be selected by military commanders and which 
require political approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say NATO political authorities micromanaged the Kosovo  
bombing campaign, tying military commanders' hands and prolonging 
the suffering of ethnic Albanians driven from their Kosovo homes by 
Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, only targets in downtown Belgrade and in the Serbian  
province of Montenegro were reviewed in advance by political 
authorities from each member country, Cohen said. The allied 
military commanders running the war had authority to select all 
other targets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we have learned a lesson in terms of the need to act  
more quickly in setting the ground rules, as such, and what targets 
should be subject to review'' by politicians, Cohen said. 
``Following such an approach from the start and identifying as 
early as possible the criteria for those targets that required 
review by higher authorities, these are important lessons for the 
alliance for future operations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The allies also need to modernize their forces, including buying  
more precision-guided munitions and aircraft communications systems 
that are both U.S.-compatible and secure from enemy eavesdropping, 
Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the allies must take on a bigger part of the burden  
in suppressing and attacking enemy air defenses, Shelton said. In 
the Kosovo conflict, allied forces could not destroy the Serb air 
defense system. 
</P>
<P>
	``This target was a very high priority from the beginning of the  
war, but by dispersing and by camouflaging their equipment and by 
using innovative tactics, the Serbs made it very difficult to 
completely shut down their air defense system,'' Shelton said. 
</P>
<P>
	In an ``after-action review'' of Operation Allied Force, the  
78-day NATO campaign against Yugoslavia, Cohen and Shelton said Air 
Force RC-135 electronic eavesdropping planes and Navy and Marine 
Corps EA-6B electronic attack aircraft were stretched thin against 
a formidable Serb air defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to find innovative and affordable ways to exploit our  
technological skills in electronic combat to bring greater pressure 
to bear on a future enemy's air defense system,'' they said in a 
joint written statement summarizing the findings thus far in an 
ongoing Pentagon study of the Kosovo conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	A fuller study, headed by Cohen's and Shelton's top deputies, is  
due in January. 
</P>
<P>
	In his oral presentation, Cohen said that despite criticism that  
NATO was slow to respond to the crisis in Kosovo and cumbersome in 
executing the air campaign, there was no realistic alternative to 
conducting the operation as an alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	``The notion that the United States could have carried out this  
mission unilaterally is just not true,'' Cohen said. ``We could not 
have done it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen also lamented what he called Yugoslav President Slobodan  
Milosevic's superior use of the international media to advance his 
aims: ``Milosevic was far more skilled in manipulation of the 
media.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Closes 54.45 Higher / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks bounced to a mixed finish today as strong  
corporate earnings and soaring bond yields prevented the market 
from charting any clear course. 
</P>
<P>
	At the close of a volatile session on Wall Street, the Dow Jones  
industrial average was up 54.45 at 10,286.61. The Dow was lower for 
much of the morning, but also rose as much as 110 points above 
Wednesday's close before giving up ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators ended mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index was down slightly, while the Nasdaq composite index managed a 
slight gain. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks initially fell today after the Commerce Department issued  
what appeared to be a report of moderate September retail sales. 
Total retail sales rose to a seasonally adjusted $253.4 billion, a 
gain of just 0.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But excluding the volatile automobile category, retail sales  
rose a brisk 0.6 percent in September. Many analysts were expecting 
a 0.5 percent gain. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, the Labor Department said the number of  
Americans filing for unemployment benefits last week fell by an 
unexpected 29,000 to 285,000. Economists believe jobless claims 
levels under 300,000 are an indication of an extremely tight labor 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	Both reports heightened fears that the Federal Reserve will  
raise interest rates for the third time this year in an effort to 
keep inflation from escalating. The Fed's Open Market Committee 
will hold its next meeting on Nov. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Fears of inflation sent the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond  
soaring to 6.32 percent, its highest level since Oct. 1997. Bond 
yields above 6.25 percent are viewed as a very appealing 
alternative to stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bonds are putting tremendous pressure on the market,'' said  
Charles Pradilla, chief investment strategist at SG Cowen 
Securities. ``If bonds weren't acting so badly, we could have had a 
powerful rally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, many analysts had anticipated that a handful of robust  
earnings reports could lift stocks from a two-day slump that 
knocked 415 points off the Dow. Instead, the good news provided 
pockets of strength in an overall weak market. 
</P>
<P>
	After releasing earnings that beat analysts' expectations, Apple  
soared, helping to contain the losses of the technology-dominated 
Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing provided much of the Dow's advance. Boeing's stock rose  
after the company said third-quarter profits rose 37 percent as its 
commercial aircraft division continued to recover from costly 
production problems. Boeing earned 52 cents per share in the 
quarter, beating analysts' estimates by 3 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	But General Motors slipped after reporting earnings of $1.33 a  
share, compared with analysts' predictions of $1.24 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	And investors continued their pattern of punishing companies for  
any measure of bad news. 
</P>
<P>
	Unisys plunged after announcing that earnings increased 72  
percent from the third quarter of 1998. The market focused on the 
fact that Boeing's revenues grew just 4 percent, below the 8 
percent anticipated by analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	Gail Dudack, chief equity strategist at Warburg Dillon Read,  
said scattered reports of earnings weakness have pushed investors 
back into the pessimism that drove stocks lower in late September 
and early October, preventing the market from building on last 
week's solid gains. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought the oversold rebound would continue this week as  
earnings season begins,'' she said. ``Instead, inflation fears and 
disappointing earnings results put the market into a tailspin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Traders suggested that the market's volatility was sparked by  
the promise of a ``double witching'' day on Friday. Quarterly stock 
and index options expire, forcing traders to adjust their 
portfolios.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Chides GOP on Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A week from a budget deadline, President  
Clinton accused Republicans on Thursday of resorting to ``reckless 
partisanship, to gimmicks and gamesmanship,'' and said GOP plans 
for across-the-board spending cuts would be too drastic. 
</P>
<P>
	Responded Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.: ``If the  
choice comes down to protecting Social Security or cutting across 
the board just a little nick off of every program, I believe the 
American people would support that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen days into fiscal 2000, the partisan crossfire  
spotlighted the rising stakes as the White House and lawmakers 
focus on the remaining, most politically complex spending bills. So 
far, five of the 13 fiscal 2000 bills have been signed into law, 
and five of the remaining ones face veto threats. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid the verbal exchanges, Congress' tardy budget work inched  
ahead. Lawmakers voted final congressional approval to a $268 
billion Pentagon measure, while the House approved a compromise $99 
billion bill for veterans, housing and science programs. 
</P>
<P>
	With an eye toward the expiration Oct. 21 of a bill keeping  
agencies open, House and Senate leaders ordered the authors of the 
biggest and most controversial spending measure to try crafting a 
compromise that Congress could pass next week. The bill, exceeding 
$310 billion, covers education, health, human services and other 
social programs. 
</P>
<P>
	It seems certain that Congress will need at least one more  
stopgap extension while lawmakers and administration officials 
complete the final bills. Members of both parties say they expect 
Clinton would sign one, even though White House spokesman Joe 
Lockhart said, ``The president has made no such commitment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton himself used a White House news conference to prod  
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are legitimate differences of opinion, but we can put an  
end to reckless partisanship, to gimmicks and gamesmanship,'' he 
said. ``We can work for a season of progress, not a winter of 
politics, and I am committed to do just that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton also said across-the-board cuts Republicans are  
considering in all 13 bills ``could deny tens of thousands of 
children Head Start opportunities, drastically reduce medical 
research, sacrifice military readiness, jeopardize the safety of 
air traffic control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders played down the impact of the cuts, which they said  
would be 1 percent or less, and insisted they would honor their 
pledge to not use Social Security surpluses to pay for spending. 
They also noted that Clinton's own budget employed the same device 
they did: ``Saving'' money in fiscal 2000 by requiring that 
billions of dollars not be spent until 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``From day one, the president's budget proposals have either  
included tax increases or raids on the Social Security surplus,'' 
said House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. ``Neither of those 
options is acceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments:  
</P>
<P>
	--The Senate gave the defense bill final approval by 87-11 after  
clearing the House Wednesday. To gain leverage, Clinton is expected 
to delay signing the measure until Congress completes the other 
spending bills. The Pentagon bill would provide the military's 
biggest pay raise in nearly two decades, slow the Air Force's F-22 
``stealth'' fighter program and seek to halt a Pentagon decline in 
readiness. It also home to gimmicks such as declaring $7 billion in 
operations and maintenance programs an ``emergency,'' meaning the 
money would not count against spending limits. 
</P>
<P>
	The 11 ``no'' votes were cast by Sens. Evan Bayh, D-Ind.;  
Barbara Boxer, D-Calif.; Russell Feingold, D-Wis.; Peter 
Fitzgerald, R-Ill.; Bob Graham, D-Fla.; Tom Harkin, D-Iowa; Herb 
Kohl, D-Wis.; John McCain, R-Ariz.; Charles Robb, D-Va.; George 
Voinovich, R-Ohio, and Paul Wellstone, D-Minn. Not voting were 
Sens. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., and John Kerry, D-Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	--The House approved the veterans-housing bill by 406-18. Senate  
approval was planned Friday, and Clinton is expected to sign it. 
The measure gives Clinton even more than he requested for 
environmental, veterans health and space programs. It is also 
includes hundreds of projects for members' districts, from $150,000 
for a hands-on children's' museum in Florence, Ala., and $2 million 
to buttress a building against earthquakes at California State 
University in San Bernadino. 
</P>
<P>
	--House-Senate bargainers neared agreement on a $38 billion  
measure for the departments of Commerce, Justice and State. White 
House support seemed uncertain. One participant said the bill would 
provide $570 million for Clinton's proposal to help communities 
hire thousands of police officers, less than half of what he wants. 
</P>
<P>
	--The House approved a District of Columbia spending measure,  
217-202. Clinton vetoed an earlier version because he said it 
intruded on local decision-making, and White House officials warned 
that the new bill would be vetoed, too.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Quake Death Toll: 17,118 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- The official death toll in Turkey's  
devastating August quake passed 17,000 on Thursday as more families 
registered relatives they had hastily buried without notifying 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	The government count reached 17,118 after authorities in  
Adapazari, one of the worst-hit areas in the Aug. 17 quake, were 
notified of about 1,200 previously unreported deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	The toll could rise further as similar registrations are  
conducted in other areas, said Halis Coskun, an official at the 
government's crisis center. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the confusion of the first few days, many people took their  
dead away and buried them in their hometowns,'' Coskun said. ``Now, 
slowly, their families are registering them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 40,000 people were injured in the magnitude 7.4 quake  
that struck Turkey's industrial heartland, destroying thousands of 
buildings and making 600,000 people homeless. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of people are still unaccounted for and some  
government officials have said they expect the toll to rise to 
20,000. The government has yet to announce a figure for the 
missing. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Disabled Association of Turkey estimated that up  
to 20,000 people were disabled as a result of quake injuries. The 
group urged authorities to take into account the disabled while 
building prefabricated houses for the homeless and increase the 
number of physical therapists in the region.

<HEADLINE> Sumitomo, Sakura Banks To Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The merger of giants Sumitomo Bank and Sakura Bank  
marks a radical step for Japan's financial sector in breaking down 
corporate barriers dating back to the 19th century. 
</P>
<P>
	The formation of what will be the world's second-largest bank,  
with assets of $922 billion, also underlines the deep sense of 
crisis gripping Japanese banks as they face growing international 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks across the world are forming alliances, or engaging in  
full-blown mergers, in attempts to expand their global reach while 
at the same time slash costs. The Sumitomo-Sakura merger, announced 
Thursday, is the latest effort in Japan's financial system to 
tackle global change amid government moves to liberalize the sector 
and make it more competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	So ineffective have Japan's banks become that the longstanding  
joke here is that it's better to put money in a drawer at home. 
Interest rates on savings accounts are slightly above zero. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks are notorious for turning poor profits and for  
foot-dragging on cost-cutting, while offering little in terms of 
attractive products and services. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger, to be completed by April 2002, will create a bank  
that is second only to the alliance, announced two months ago, of 
three other major Japanese banks -- Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Fuji Bank 
and Industrial Bank of Japan. Assets at those three banks total 
more than $1.2 trillion. 
</P>
<P>
	Both planned mergers surpass the existing No. 1, Germany's  
Deutsche Bank with $868.3 billion in assets, as well as the largest 
bank in the United States -- Citigroup, at $668.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar restructuring is likely to continue, said James  
Fiorillo, an analyst with ING Barings in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Sakura-Sumitomo news puts a sense of urgency on possible  
alliances between other players, big and small, banks and 
non-banks,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sumitomo president Yoshifumi Nishikawa acknowledged that the  
earlier three-bank alliance was a major impetus behind his decision 
to go ahead with the merger. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt I had to act faster,'' Nishikawa said. ``We agreed if  
we get together, we could create a top global brand.'' The name of 
the new Sumitomo-Sakura bank is still undecided, however. 
</P>
<P>
	For tradition-bound Japan, the merger was groundbreaking for  
another reason: The banks hail from two fiercely rival business 
groups, Sumitomo and Mitsui. 
</P>
<P>
	Known historically as ``zaibatsu'' (pronounced zaye-bah-tsooh),  
these powerful family-business conglomerates, which also included 
Mitsubishi and Yasuda, dominated the nation's finances and 
industries from the 1800s. 
</P>
<P>
	Zaibatsu technically disappeared with the U.S. occupation after  
World War II, but tight networks defining how Japanese companies 
did business remained. 
</P>
<P>
	Crossing zaibatsu borders was once unthinkable.  
</P>
<P>
	``It clearly showed that times had changed, and that this was no  
time to be quibbling over zaibatsu links if the banks hope to 
become global players,'' said Juichi Yamanaka, senior analyst and 
banking expert at Kokusai Securities Co. in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Sumitomo and Sakura still have plenty of problems. First of  
all, they must do a better job of turning profits. They must clean 
up the bad loans left over from the speculative lending of the late 
1980s that plague the entire banking sector and led to the collapse 
of one commercial bank and two long-term credit banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Both banks said they would start taking action now, ahead of the  
merger. The banks will cut their employees by a combined total of 
6,300, or 20 percent, by the merger, and another 3,000 by March 
2004. They will close 151 of their 800 domestic branches and 32 of 
their 45 foreign branches. 
</P>
<P>
	The banks also promised to develop new businesses and  
strategies, such as Internet shopping malls, and bring together 
their international banking operations and ATM networks.

<HEADLINE> Umpires Urged To Imitate NFL Calls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A day after a blown call cost the Red Sox an  
extra-inning scoring opportunity, Boston manager Jimy Williams said 
he would like to see umpires imitate other sports and discuss tough 
decisions to make sure they get them right. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpire Rick Reed has admitted that he blew a call at second base  
in the 10th inning of Game 1 of the AL championship series. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's six umpires out there. They're supposed to be a  
team,'' Williams said Thursday. ``They have to help each other, 
don't they?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reed got a cheer from the Yankee Stadium crowd when he was  
introduced prior to Game 2 of the best-of-7 series. 
</P>
<P>
	The good will did not last long, however. Reed, working at first  
base, called Chuck Knoblauch out on a close play leading off the 
New York first, drawing boos from the fans and a brief argument 
from manager Joe Torre. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday night, after Jose Offerman singled leading off the  
10th, John Valentin hit a grounder to third. Scott Brosius threw to 
second attempting to force the runner, but Knoblauch dropped the 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed called Offerman out, even though the replay showed  
Knoblauch never had the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought he had possession before he dropped the ball,'' Reed  
said after the game. ``After we went in and looked at the tape, we 
decided that wasn't the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``As an umpire, it was my job to get it right. I didn't. You  
feel bad about it. I feel awful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of having runners at first and second with nobody out,  
the Red Sox had a runner on first with one out. The next batter, 
Brian Daubach, hit into an inning-ending double play. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernie Williams led off the bottom of the 10th with a  
game-winning home run off Rod Beck. 
</P>
<P>
	``It changed the whole format of the game,'' Boston outfielder  
Darren Lewis said. ``On that type of play, you need that call.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams wondered why baseball umpires can't follow the lead of  
the NFL and NBA, leagues whose officials frequently discuss a play 
before making a call. The Red Sox manager said, however, he doesn't 
want baseball to use instant replay, as professional football does. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love the human element in baseball. I think it's a beautiful  
part of this game,'' Williams said. ``I think maybe the game's a 
lot like life. So why put something like that in there?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams noted that the umpires corrected themselves in the  
first round when Cleveland's Travis Fryman hit the ball off an 
outfield railing against the Red Sox. The ball bounced back onto 
the field and was ruled in play by left-field umpire Tim Welke, but 
Jim Joyce, who was at second base, came out to say it was a homer. 
</P>
<P>
	``He (Joyce) said our whole responsibility is to get the call  
right,'' Williams said, ``so I accepted that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Williams is wondering why this crew didn't have the same  
attitude. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't ask Rick (to ask) for help. I guess I messed up,''  
Williams said. ``But why did I have to?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, who was more annoyed than angry about the incident,  
said he did not blame the umpires for Boston's Game 1 loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm certainly not trying to tell the American League how to  
run their umpires. I'm not mad up here. And I'm not saying we would 
have scored,'' he said. ``I'm not trying to point the finger at 
Rick Reed or anything. We have to go on.''

<HEADLINE> Boeing Profits Rise 37 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Shares of Boeing Co. surged nearly 8 percent  
Thursday, buoyed by news of a 37 percent increase in third-quarter 
profits the aerospace company. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing reported had net income of $477 million, or 52 cents a  
share, compared to profits of $347 million, or 36 cents a share, a 
year earlier. Revenues rose 4 percent to $13.28 billion from $12.72 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Profits were slightly higher than the consensus estimate of 49  
cents a share by analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. 
Investors, pleased with the results, bid Boeing stock up $3.12 1/2, to 
$43.62 1/2 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	In Boeing's key commercial aircraft segment, operating earnings  
were $501 million on revenues of $8.5 billion, compared with a loss 
of $142 million on revenues of $7.8 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing delivered 142 jetliners in the quarter and 455 in the  
first nine months of the year, compared with 368 in the first nine 
months of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997 and 1998, Boeing was beset with production line snarls,  
delayed deliveries and the Asian financial crisis. Overall, it lost 
$178 million in 1997 and had depressed earnings of $1.1 billion in 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Condit, Boeing chairman and chief executive officer, said  
the company was able to make significant cost improvements on two 
new aircraft programs, the next-generation 737 and widebody 777. 
Improved world economic conditions also will allow sustained 
production of one of Boeing's more profitable planes, the jumbo 
747-400. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are realizing significant performance improvement in  
production and are confident in our ability to deliver about 620 
commercial airplanes this year,'' Condit said. ``Due in part to the 
improved Asian economy, we are able to maintain 747 production rate 
at two per month through 2000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts were impressed. ``Boeing had excellent performance and  
they are continuously moving up,'' said Paul Nisbet, aerospace 
analyst with JSA Research Inc. in Newport, R.I. ``You can't ask for 
an awful lot more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Profits for the quarter ended Sept. 30 included a one-time gain  
of $59 million or 7 cents a share from the sale of Boeing 
Information Services, and a gain of $41 million or 4 cents a share 
associated with the sale of shares from an initial public stock 
offering by an insurer. In addition, Boeing also took a previously 
announced, one-time charge of $141 million or 15 cents a share due 
to a lack of orders for its F-15 fighter. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding non-recurring items in both years, third-quarter  
earnings per share were 56 cents in 1999 and 30 cents in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of 1999, profits were $1.65 billion or  
$1.76 a share, compared to $655 million, or 67 cents a share, a 
year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues were $42.79 billion, up 10 percent from $39.06 billion  
in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Nations Upset by U.S. Treaty Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Russia accused the United States on Thursday of  
undermining world stability with the Senate defeat of a 
multinational nuclear test ban treaty, and China, another nuclear 
giant, called the rejection deeply worrying. 
</P>
<P>
	Around the globe, nations charged Washington with sending out a  
wrong and dangerous signal. 
</P>
<P>
	India hinted it may take its time before signing on to the  
treaty. And in Pakistan -- India's uneasy neighbor and fellow 
nuclear power -- the military leaders who seized control two days 
ago had nothing to say. 
</P>
<P>
	But a spokesman for Pakistani opposition leader Benazir Bhutto  
said it is virtually certain now that neither Pakistan nor India 
will sign the treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every country will use it as an excuse not to sign,'' added  
opposition leader Naveed Qamar. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid widespread fears, Western powers appealed to the U.S.  
Senate to think again. 
</P>
<P>
	``This decision is a serious setback for nuclear  
nonproliferation and disarmament. It is a wrong signal which we 
deeply regret,'' German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said in a 
joint statement with his Swedish counterpart, Anna Lindh, during a 
visit to Stockholm. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil ``deplored'' the Senate's decision, saying the vote was  
``of great concern, above all in light of recent violations of 
non-proliferation norms,'' a government statement read. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the U.S. Senate's voted 48-51 on Wednesday, Germany had  
joined with Britain and France -- the only two nuclear powers in 
Western Europe -- in a special appeal to the Senate not to reject 
the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which would outlaw underground 
testing of nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States is the first of the world's declared nuclear  
powers to specifically reject it. 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty has been signed by 154 nations, including the United  
States, but has been ratified by only 26 of the 44 nuclear-capable 
states that must approve it to put it into force. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain and France have signed and ratified the treaty, China  
and Russia have signed but not ratified, and India, Pakistan and 
North Korea have done neither. 
</P>
<P>
	In Moscow, the Foreign Ministry said Russia was ``disillusioned  
and seriously concerned,'' and labeled the vote part of a U.S. 
attempt to ``destabilize the foundations of international 
relations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	India said it remained committed to suspending underground  
testing and to signing the treaty, but other nations were expected 
to ``act accordingly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. vote showed the treaty ``is not a simple issue,''  
India's Foreign Ministry said in a statement. ``Among other things, 
it requires building a national consensus in the countries 
concerned, including India.'' 
</P>
<P>
	China, more restrained than Moscow, said it would nevertheless  
speed up its own efforts to ratify the treaty and continue with a 
self-imposed moratorium on nuclear tests. 
</P>
<P>
	In Vienna, the commission set up to administer the proposed  
global ban said it would continue work anyway and hope the U.S. 
changes its mind. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican opponents in the U.S. Senate, who were largely  
responsible for inflicting the foreign policy defeat on President 
Clinton, argued that the treaty was not verifiable, would not halt 
the nuclear ambitions of North Korea and Iran, and would endanger 
the safety and reliability of the U.S. nuclear arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said Thursday he would proceed according to the terms of  
the treaty despite the Senate action. ``I have no intention of 
doing anything other than sticking with the obligations imposed by 
the treaty on the United States,'' said Clinton. The United States 
has not conducted nuclear tests since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Among officials at NATO and the United Nations, there were  
expressions of regret, often combined with fears that the U.S. vote 
had dealt what Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon called 
``an enormous blow to all our efforts to make the world a safer 
place to live in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan expressed dismay and renewed  
his call for all countries to sign the pact. Annan, who oversees 
ratifications of the treaty, noted in a statement that signatories 
of the treaty at a conference in Vienna last week had ``reaffirmed 
the importance of a universal and internationally and effectively 
verifiable comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Australia, however, showed some sympathy.  
</P>
<P>
	``As the world's one remaining superpower, (the United States)  
sees itself as having a special global responsibility,'' 
Environment Minister Robert Hill said.

<HEADLINE> Kmart Plans 400 New Stores </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Kmart Corp. plans to open 400 new stores over the  
next five years, including 70 stores next year, as the discount 
retailer moves to expand into larger, metropolitan markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Troy, Mich.-based company also announced Thursday that it  
would renovate 166 smaller stores. 
</P>
<P>
	About half of the new stores will be Super Kmarts, which are  
bigger stores that carry groceries along with wide array of general 
merchandise goods, such as clothes and home furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
	News of the expansion comes as Kmart wraps up a multi-year  
program to convert 1,840 stores to Big Kmart stores at a cost of 
$1.1 billion. The Big Kmart stores include general merchandise 
products as well as small food department. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, with a store base that has undergone a massive facelift  
in the past three years, customers are coming back to Kmart,'' 
chief executive Floyd Hall said at an investor conference in White 
Plains, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kmart still struggles to keep pace with rival Wal-Mart  
Stores Inc., which continues to dominate the discount store market 
with their aggressive pricing strategy and advanced distribution 
and delivery system. 
</P>
<P>
	Just last week, Wal-Mart announced it will open, remodel or  
relocate as many as 340 stores next year, as well as greatly expand 
the number of distribution centers it operates. 
</P>
<P>
	With Kmart's new expansion plans, the company hopes to expand  
its presence in urban markets and metropolitan areas, where 
Wal-Mart doesn't have as large a presence. 
</P>
<P>
	Kmart announced in July that it hired Supervalu Inc. and Fleming  
Companies Inc. -- the two largest U.S. grocery distributors -- to 
stock $3.9 billion of goods a year on its stores' shelves. The 
agreement enables Kmart to avoid building an expensive food 
delivery system of its own -- similar to the one Wal-Mart already 
has in place. 
</P>
<P>
	Kmart operates 2,153 stores in the United States, Puerto Rico,  
Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

<HEADLINE> Hoop Hall of Famer Coaching at URI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Basketball Hall of Famer K.C. Jones, who  
starred for and later coached the Boston Celtics to two NBA titles, 
was hired Thursday by the University of Rhode Island as an 
assistant for the women's team. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, 67, most recently was head coach of the Hartford-based  
New England Blizzard of the women's American Basketball League. The 
league disbanded following the 1998-99 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I chose to take this position because I still have a passion  
for this game of basketball,'' Jones said. ``I'm not ready to give 
it up yet ... I think I still have something to offer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For its part, Rhode Island is hoping Jones will be able to help  
get the women's basketball team into shape. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhode Island was 18-63 over the past three seasons under head  
coach Linda Zemke. She was fired after the 1998-99 season and 
replaced by Linda Pearman, who recommended the hiring of Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the university administration said it wanted a  
national-level women's basketball program, I knew the first thing 
that had to be done was to put a national-level coaching staff in 
place,'' said Pearman, a former assistant to Jones with the 
Blizzard. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of Jones' contract with Rhode Island were not disclosed.  
</P>
<P>
	Jones said coaching women for two seasons gave him a new  
perspective on the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once you've seen four, five women's games, it goes beyond  
gender,'' he said. ``It's how they play. It's like `I've got to get 
an A in hustle.''' 
</P>
<P>
	``They play what you call fundamental basketball.''  
</P>
<P>
	During Jones' playing days from 1958-67, the Celtics won eight  
NBA championships. 
</P>
<P>
	He guided the Celtics to NBA titles in 1984 and 1986, coaching  
such greats as Larry Bird, Kevin McHale and Robert Parish. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in  
1989, also has been head coach of the Washington Bullets, and the 
Seattle Supersonics.

<HEADLINE> Rams' Bruce Is Back on Top </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Isaac Bruce is back on his game. Just ask him.  
</P>
<P>
	A few days after Bruce caught a career-high four touchdown  
passes last week in the St. Louis Rams' 42-20 victory over the San 
Francisco 49ers, he was asked if he was the NFL's top wide 
receiver. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, I agree,'' Bruce said. ``I wouldn't disagree with  
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce's return from hamstring problems that limited him to 15  
games the past two seasons is a major factor in the emergence of 
quarterback Kurt Warner, who has gone from unknown to cover boy in 
record time. Before he was hurt, there was no question he was among 
the league's best. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's probably one of the most gifted players I've ever met,''  
offensive coordinator Mike Martz said. ``He is huge. You have to 
account for Isaac right away; that's the first thing a defense has 
to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, his first year as a starter, Bruce had the second-best  
receiving year in NFL history with 1,781 yards on 119 catches. He 
followed that with an 84-catch, 1,338-yard year in 1996, making the 
Pro Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came the down time. He missed almost all of the first five  
games in 1997, and played in only five games last year, finishing 
with 32 receptions and only one touchdown as coach Dick Vermeil 
brought in various experts to work with him. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, he's back to stretching defenses with his trademark zigzag  
routes. He leads the NFC with 446 yards receiving, is among the 
leaders with six touchdowns and 22 receptions and burned the 49ers 
with five catches for 134 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ike's had two years where a lot of people doubted him,  
second-guessed him and questioned whether maybe that hamstring was 
as bad as it was,'' Vermeil said. ``Was it chronic? Was his career 
over? I think he's just erased all that type of skeptical thinking. 
He is a blur.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vermeil was among the doubters for a time. The two clashed in  
1997 when the wide receiver criticized the team's play after a loss 
and Vermeil responded by calling him a ``so-called superstar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce, predictably, says the relationship is ``about the same.  
It hasn't really changed. We're fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also stopped short of giving Vermeil any credit for the Rams'  
unbeaten start. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no real difference, just a lot of guys with a lot more  
confidence from the fact we have a lot more weapons on offense,'' 
Bruce said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wide receivers coach Al Saunders has watched Bruce closely and  
monitored his workload since training camp to avoid a recurrence of 
the hamstring problems. On the other hand, both Vermeil and Bruce 
say one of the keys to his effectiveness is he practices as hard as 
he plays. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he gets in the game, the rhythm and the timing and the  
route-running, he's been through it,'' Vermeil said. ``It isn't 
that all of a sudden you change gears.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only disappointment for Bruce thus far is a $2,500 fine  
handed down by the NFL for throwing the ball into the stands after 
one of his touchdowns on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``They'll be hearing from my lawyer,'' Bruce said.  
</P>
<P>
	He's also kept his game face on all year. No grins after the  
four-TD game, no jubilation on Wednesday when selected offensive 
player of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too early to be smiling,'' Bruce said. ``We've still got  
to win some more games. We've got to get to the playoffs and I'll 
be cheesing from ear to ear.''

<HEADLINE> Innocent Plea in Astros Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- A man who ran from the stands and jumped on the  
back of a Houston Astros outfielder during a game at County Stadium 
pleaded innocent to disorderly conduct charges Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Berley W. Visgar, 23, of South Beloit, Ill., made his initial  
appearance before Milwaukee County Circuit Court Commissioner 
Dennis R. Cimpl on Thursday. He faces up to 90 days in jail and a 
$1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Visgar is accused of attacking Astros right fielder Bill Spiers  
during a game Sept. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	The sheriff's deputy who arrested Visgar said he appeared  
intoxicated and smelled strongly of alcohol. Visgar admitted to 
drinking at least three beers at the game and both beer and vodka 
before arriving at the stadium, a criminal complaint said. 
</P>
<P>
	Visgar told authorities he never wanted to hurt Spiers and  
jumped on his back to attract the attention of the 14,000 fans, the 
complaint said. 
</P>
<P>
	Spiers received scrapes to his face and suffered from neck and  
back pain. 
</P>
<P>
	Visgar already had posted cash bail of $1,150. As a condition of  
his bail, Cimpl forbid Visgar from going to any sporting event 
where he has to pay to get in, Assistant District Attorney Tom 
McAdams said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	A pre-trial conference is scheduled for Nov. 4.

<HEADLINE> Cayard Back With America's Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Twelve years ago, Dennis Conner went Down Under and won back the  
America's Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Cayard would like to do the same this time around as  
sailing's biggest regatta begins in New Zealand next week. He's 
tired of finishing second, and he's not particularly happy with 
America's showing in the last America's Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the wily Conner is back once more, heading one of five  
U.S. syndicates that will compete in the challenger eliminations 
leading to the America's Cup match beginning in mid-February, 
Cayard is considered to have the best chance of bringing the 
America's Cup back to American shores. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like it to play out that well,'' Cayard said before  
leaving his base in San Francisco for Auckland. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a trophy that I've chased since 1983. I've been very  
close to winning it but haven't quite gotten there. This time I 
hope we're going to get there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cayard was Conner's helmsman in 1995 and watched helplessly as  
Team New Zealand's Black Magic raced away with a stunning 5-0 sweep 
of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years earlier, as skipper of Italy's Il Moro di Venezia,  
he lost 4-1 to Bill Koch's America3, which was fueled by a $65 
million budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Cayard has a bigger role this time, serving as CEO and skipper  
of his own syndicate, AmericaOne, which represents San Francisco's 
St. Francis Yacht Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only will Cayard steer the 75-foot yacht that bears the  
syndicate's name, but he led the fundraising efforts, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the 1995 America's Cup, Cayard added to his credentials by  
becoming the first American skipper to win the grueling Whitbread 
Round the World Race. 
</P>
<P>
	But the America's Cup still holds the strongest allure for the  
40-year-old Cayard. His two goals are to make up for the 1995 
debacle and bring the America's Cup to San Francisco Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, the Americans were badly outclassed by the Kiwis.  
</P>
<P>
	``The finals were never, ever close to a match,'' said Cayard,  
who contends that the Americans were so far behind in technology 
that any of the top three or four challengers that year could have 
beaten the Americans in the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's how far off the pace we were,'' he said. ``The United  
States never has been that inferior to the rest of the world in 
sailing. We're a strong sailing country. That was not 
representative of our ability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AmericaOne is backed by top technology sponsors SAIC, Boeing and  
Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Kiwis did a better job than everyone else of dialing  
into the conditions off San Diego, Cayard feels the conditions are 
more variable on the Hauraki Gulf off Auckland than they were off 
San Diego or Fremantle, Australia, where Conner reclaimed the Cup 
in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	``It can be pretty tricky sailing,'' said Cayard, whose crew has  
trained off both Auckland and Long Beach, Calif. ``That means it 
should make it more of a sailor's race and less of a boat speed 
race, but you can't be way off the pace and make it work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Should Cayard win the Louis Vuitton Cup for challengers, then  
beat the Kiwis in the America's Cup match, he'd take the Cup to 
what he feels would be a perfect venue -- San Francisco Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	That kind of public exposure might be one of the best things to  
happen to what's generally considered an elitist sport. 
</P>
<P>
	``San Francisco in three years, wow,'' Cayard said. ``This thing  
could be a hip event. People would be psyched about it. It does 
have this technological bent to it, and with the Internet and 
Silicon Valley, it would be perfectly suited to those types of 
corporate interests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Which brings up one of the most important factors in winning the  
America's Cup -- money. 
</P>
<P>
	AmericaOne's budget is estimated at $32 million. Its toughest  
competition in getting through to the America's Cup match is 
expected to be Italy's Prada Challenge, which has a budget 
estimated at $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happens between now and March 1, a lot of variables and  
circumstantial things come in play there,'' Cayard said. ``But we 
have a very talented team that's experienced at the America's Cup 
game. As long as we can keep feeding that cash flow, we will be a 
very hard team to beat.''

<HEADLINE> Unsolved JonBenet Case Is Not Alone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- While the pressure to solve the JonBenet Ramsey  
slaying has been intense, dozens of child homicides remain unsolved 
across the nation, out of the media spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
	There is, for example, the case of Dimetria Smith, taken to a  
Georgia hospital a couple weeks short of her third birthday in 
1991, suffering from a fatal blow to the head. More than eight 
years later, her killer has not been brought to justice, despite 
two grand juries that both brought indictments. 
</P>
<P>
	Danny Craig, the district attorney in Georgia's Augusta Judicial  
Circuit, said grand juries brought indictments against both the 
girl's maternal grandfather and grandmother, but there isn't enough 
evidence to determine which may have committed the crime. It may 
never go to trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't ask jurors to take a leap of faith and find someone  
guilty when we ourselves are not convinced of their guilt beyond a 
reasonable doubt,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, 66 percent of all U.S. homicides were considered  
cleared by arrest or other circumstances, according to the FBI, 
which could not provide the same statistics for child homicides. At 
least one-third either were unsolved or suspects were not brought 
to trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Child-homicide experts believe justice is served in a much  
smaller percentage of child killings, but only if probable murders 
that are ruled unexplained deaths for lack of evidence are counted. 
</P>
<P>
	Rob Parrish, chief child-abuse counsel for the Utah attorney  
general's office, said one barrier to bringing a child's killer to 
justice is a widespread belief that a parent or guardian cannot be 
the murderer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more mainstream the family or the alleged or suspected  
perpetrator appears, the more difficult it is for decision-makers 
to believe that they were involved,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig, who took over as Augusta district attorney after  
Dimetria's death, called the lack of certainty in the case ``very 
unusual, very frustrating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If JonBenet had not been a beauty-pageant contestant who was  
killed at Christmastime, her slaying might have gone as unnoticed 
as that of Dimetria, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This case would be like several hundred others across the  
United States, where a tragedy escapes the notice of the public and 
cannot serve as a deterrent to crime,'' Craig said.

<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Nippon Mitsubishi Oil Corp. has agreed to conduct  
research and develop fuel-cell-powered vehicles in cooperation with 
the Japanese subsidiary of the German-American automaker 
DaimlerChrysler AG. 
</P>
<P>
	Nippon Mitsubishi Oil and DaimlerChrysler Japan Holding Ltd.  
will develop fuels and promote fuel-cell vehicles in Japan. The 
companies plan to a test run by March 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	A fuel cell combines hydrogen and oxygen without combustion to  
generate non-polluting electricity. Hydrogen can be obtained from 
methanol, natural gas or petroleum, while oxygen is taken from air. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler, Ford Motor Co. and others have already entered  
an alliance to test vehicles powered by hydrogen fuel cells in 
California. DaimlerChrysler and Ford plan to put fuel-cell powered 
vehicles on the market by 2004.

<HEADLINE> So. California Has Clean Air Summer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Southern California, long reputed to have the  
dirtiest air in the United States, finished the cleanest summer 
smog season on record, air quality regulators said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was also the first summer without a single Stage 1 ozone  
alert since air monitoring began about 50 years ago, according to 
the South Coast Air Quality Management District. 
</P>
<P>
	During a Stage 1, the district advises everyone to avoid  
vigorous outdoor exercise and suggests that sensitive persons 
remain indoors. 
</P>
<P>
	The district covers all of Orange County and parts of Los  
Angeles, Riverside and San Bernardino counties, encompassing some 
15 million people.

	``At the beginning of the decade, we predicted that Stage I  
episodes would end by 2000,'' said district executive officer Barry 
Wallerstein. ``It appears the region is right on schedule, although 
we still could see some Stage 1 episodes over the next few years if 
the region experiences extremely stagnant weather.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The highest recorded level of ozone in the district this year  
was .17 parts per million, occurring June 20 in the central San 
Bernardino Mountains. That was below the .20 ppm level needed for a 
so-called Stage 1 episode.

<HEADLINE> Sheriff: Return Columbine Videos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The Jefferson County sheriff's department is  
calling for the return of all copies of a surveillance videotape 
from the Columbine High School shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an embarrassment for me and the agency to have that out  
there,'' Sheriff John P. Stone said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the department, the grainy, jerky footage shown on  
national television Tuesday came from an unauthorized copy of a 
CD-ROM. The unauthorized copy was used in a presentation at a 
conference sponsored by the National Sheriffs' Association in Fort 
McClellan, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	Undersheriff John A. Dunaway said it has not been determined who  
copied the CD-ROM. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``CBS Evening News'' and some of the network's affiliates  
Tuesday aired snippets of the tape that documented a few terrifying 
seconds of the April 20 rampage that left 15 people dead, including 
the two gunmen, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold. 
</P>
<P>
	The footage was videotaped off a large projection screen at a  
training seminar for law enforcement and emergency workers by 
KRQE-TV, a CBS affiliate in Albuquerque, N.M. No bodies are seen on 
the tape. 
</P>
<P>
	The footage, originally used by Jefferson County sheriff's  
deputies in their investigation of the shooting, had been given to 
the Littleton Fire Department. The sheriff's office also provided 
the footage to police and emergency agencies to help with training. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire department made copies on CD-ROMs and passed them out  
to fire and police departments at a conference in Kansas City in 
August. The CD-ROM that was copied was being used by the Arapahoe 
County (Colo.) sheriff's office in a presentation at an Alabama 
conference.

<HEADLINE> Trump Casino Holds Liquidation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- For once, the house lost.  
</P>
<P>
	Trump World's Fair Casino was more like the a flea market on  
Thursday: TVs were going for $159, lamps for $45, alarm clocks for 
$10, blankets for $5 and pillows for $1. 
</P>
<P>
	The monthlong sale is to prepare the casino for the wrecking  
ball. 
</P>
<P>
	The lobby of the 22-story Boardwalk tower looked like a hastily  
opened furniture showroom. Everything had a price tag on it. 
Customers were free to roam the 500-room hotel in search of chairs, 
pictures, clock radios and other items. Blackjack tables, slot 
machines and other gambling devices were off-limits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came looking for a wet bar for my house, but they were too  
big,'' said Tom Breuel, 42, who was waiting in line to pay for a 
wastepaper basket, an ice bucket and two lamps. ``I'll probably 
come back again. It's cheaper than I'd get these things in a 
store.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The casino, which opened in 1981 as the Playboy and later  
operated as the Atlantis, has always bled money. It was forced into 
bankruptcy in 1989. Donald Trump bought it for $63 million and 
operated it as a non-casino hotel -- Trump Regency -- for years 
before investing $48 million and reopening it in 1996 as Trump 
World's Fair Casino. 
</P>
<P>
	It was losing $10 million a year by the time Trump decided to  
demolish it and start over.

<HEADLINE> Miami's Gadsden Shows He's No Fluke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- Oronde Gadsden estimates the long pass from  
Dan Marino hung in the air for more than two seconds, which allowed 
plenty of time to ponder the ramifications. 
</P>
<P>
	The ball spiraled toward Gadsden on fourth-and-10 in Sunday's  
game against the Indianapolis Colts. At the time, with 60 seconds 
remaining, the Miami Dolphins trailed 31-27. 
</P>
<P>
	``A whole bunch of stuff goes through your head,'' Gadsden said  
Thursday, chuckling at the memory. ``You can catch it and be the 
hero. You can drop it and be the goat. You can catch it and fumble, 
or catch it and break the tackle. There are a hundred things that 
go through your mind so fast. And then everything gets silent, 
because you have so much concentration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Gadsden and the Dolphins, the drama had a happy ending. He  
made the catch for a 48-yard gain to the 2, then caught Marino's 
touchdown lob two plays later to cap a thrilling 34-31 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Gadsden finished with four catches for 123 yards, a performance  
that should help him achieve his goal this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to show people I wasn't a fluke last year,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, as a 27-year-old rookie, Gadsden caught 48 passes for  
713 yards and seven touchdowns. That was after catching 37 TD 
passes for the Portland Forest Dragons in 14 Arena League games. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Gadsden is again an important part of a receiving corps  
that also includes newcomer Tony Martin and O.J. McDuffie, the NFL 
leader in receptions last year. Miami's pass-catchers were 
much-maligned in 1998, but coach Jimmy Johnson ranks the current 
group with the best in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	And Johnson considers Gadsden anything but a fluke.  
</P>
<P>
	``From Day 1, any time we've gotten the ball in his hands, he's  
made big plays,'' Johnson said. ``He's a big-time receiver. You've 
just got to get the ball in his hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Choice of receivers was a sore topic last week at the Dolphins'  
complex. Johnson criticized Marino for often choosing the wrong 
target, but there were no further complaints after Miami gained 393 
yards passing against the Colts. 
</P>
<P>
	Gadsden's productivity has improved with each game this year, so  
it's difficult to predict his role in Sunday's AFC East showdown at 
New England. At 6-2 and 215 pounds, he's a big target with sure 
hands. He has only average speed and is slowed by painful arthritic 
toes that will require surgery after the season. 
</P>
<P>
	But at Indy, to his surprise, Gadsden was the primary deep  
threat. He caught a 62-yard bomb on third-and-long. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coming into the season, I thought Tony would be the deep  
receiver, O.J. would be the intermediate receiver and I would have 
the short routes,'' Gadsden said. ``I'm not sure what my role is. I 
want to do whatever I can, whether it's a 2-yard pass or a 62-yard 
pass.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he doesn't want to become the go-to guy on fourth-and-10.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's a lot of pressure,'' he said with a laugh. ``I don't  
want to always have to come up with the catch like that.''

<HEADLINE> Niners' Young May Stop Playing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Steve Young's playing days could be  
over. 
</P>
<P>
	No one came out and said it directly, least of all Young, who  
smiled but walked past reporters without a word Thursday on his way 
to watch the San Francisco 49ers practice. 
</P>
<P>
	But clearly, the groundwork is being laid for the retirement of  
Young, 38, who has been sidelined indefinitely by lingering 
symptoms from his fourth concussion in three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Gary Steinberg, the chief of neurosurgery at Stanford  
Medical School and Young's neurologist, has given Young and the 
49ers his recommendation on whether the two-time NFL MVP should 
continue playing. 
</P>
<P>
	Young, Steinberg, general manager Bill Walsh and coach Steve  
Mariucci all declined to discuss the nature of the doctor's 
recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only one who can answer that question is Steve Young,''  
Walsh said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Walsh did say he met with Young, discussed his future  
and encouraged Young to seek additional medical opinions, leading 
to the possible conclusion that Steinberg recommended Young retire 
because of the potential for long-term health risks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Five to 10 years from now, when he's feeling really fit, he's  
going to say, `Why didn't I play football? I took the advice of one 
physician. I should have really checked into it,''' Walsh said. ``I 
want to make sure he really checks into everything. He has to have 
more than one opinion, just for his own well-being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh said there might be a formal announcement of Young's  
future in the next two weeks. Young also is expected to meet Friday 
with his agent, Leigh Steinberg, who isn't related to the doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to remember Steve has been playing football all his  
life and for anyone to think that this process is going to be real 
quick and rapid, it's not going to happen that way,'' Leigh 
Steinberg said. ``It's a deliberate process. But all the people 
around Steve are trying to help him do the right things. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing is he's not playing right now so he's not hurting  
himself. He's 38 and he does have the right to make up his own mind 
about this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh, Mariucci, the doctor and the agent said Young still wants  
to play football. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's trying to hang on because he's so darn good at it.  
Certainly, in Steve's mind, there is some hope, somewhere he's 
reaching for some hope that, `Hey, I'll be back,''' Mariucci said. 
``That's what he thinks about. That's why I don't think it's going 
to happen today or tomorrow. We're going to give it its due time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steinberg said Young has shown improvement since the hit 2 1/2  
weeks ago that caused his latest concussion. However, Young 
underwent neurological tests Wednesday and again wasn't cleared to 
rejoin the 49ers on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason he hasn't been cleared to play up until now is that  
it's my opinion and the opinion of the 49ers that it's in the best 
interest of Steve Young to allow his brain to recover,'' Dr. 
Steinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	While Young viewed Steinberg's ruling as a temporary setback, it  
comes amid signs that his family, friends and some team officials 
want him to retire rather than resume playing and expose himself to 
another damaging hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Young, who endured two concussions in 1996 and another in the  
1997 season opener, suffered the latest one when he was leveled by 
blitzing Arizona cornerback Aeneas Williams and struck his head on 
tackle Dave Fiore's knee before slamming into the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Steinberg said there were no signs of bruising or permanent  
damage to Young's brain but that there are dangers from repeated 
concussions, which can lead to premature senility and other brain 
dysfunction. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to be cautious in our recommendation,'' he said.  
``This is an unpredictable kind of event. You don't have a crystal 
ball to tell what's going to happen in any particular case. But my 
advice is my opinion and I don't dictate what the ultimate team 
decision is or Steve Young's decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh said Young is being realistic about the situation and the  
49ers management was there to help him along with the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	And if he can't make it on his own?  
</P>
<P>
	``We're here,'' Walsh said. ``It would fall on us.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Turns Attention to Moderates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After courting labor bosses and traditional  
liberal Democrats for days, Vice President Al Gore told a leading 
group of moderates Thursday that he will help ``bring our party 
together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His address to the Democratic Leadership Council focused on  
globalization and trade, an issue that often drives a wedge between 
the party's liberals and moderates. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to make trade work for working families,'' he told the  
DLC, which has helped the Clinton administration push free-trade 
agreements over union objections. 
</P>
<P>
	In words meant as a salve to both sides in the trade dispute,  
Gore said, ``I strongly believe that our president needs authority 
to reach new trade agreements to open new markets to our goods and 
services. But as president, with your help, I also will insist on 
(agreements that protect) workers' rights ... and human rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That caveat, aimed at appeasing labor, also was part of Gore's  
acceptance speech Wednesday to the AFL-CIO, the powerful labor 
group that endorsed him over rival Bill Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore supporters viewed the back-to-back addresses as an example  
of how he can unite the party's two wings. ``He is the one 
candidate who can build bridges and maintain them across the full 
range of our party and our country,'' said Sen. Joseph Lieberman, 
D-Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	Before picking up the union nod, Gore and Bradley had faced off  
twice before separate audiences of Democratic activists. Both 
times, Gore sharpened his attacks on Bradley, insinuating that the 
former New Jersey senator is not a loyal Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	Both rivals, in raw appeals to core primary voters, have  
promised costly new government programs to improve education and 
health care. Their battle on the left could leave Democrats exposed 
in the general election, DLC members said. 
</P>
<P>
	Al From, director of the DLC, said in an interview that  
Republican front-runner George W. Bush could take advantage of his 
lead and begin moving to the great political middle -- the home of 
most swing voters. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, Bush has taken tiny steps in that direction, attacking  
Congress on its budget plans and accusing Republicans of being too 
negative. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't concede any territory to Bush,'' From warned. ``We  
created it. We developed the policies. We, not Bush, should push 
the centrist agenda into the 21st century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The worst-case scenario for Democrats is a long, bloody  
nomination battle that leaves the nominee broke and easily cast as 
a liberal by a well-funded GOP nominee who has been courting 
moderate voters for months. 
</P>
<P>
	From said Bush talks a good game, but has not developed an a  
centrist agenda -- something Bill Clinton did during his 1992 
presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he had no doubt that Gore and Bradley are moderate  
enough to beat Bush. Both are firm centrists on trade, taxes and a 
host of other issues, with Bradley's opposition to welfare reform 
being the sole exception, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we're in any danger that the party will go  
back'' to its liberal ways, From said. 
</P>
<P>
	The union endorsement was important to Gore, but the vice  
president doesn't have to bow to every labor boss' demand in 2000, 
From said 
</P>
<P>
	``You want their support. You want their money. You want their  
organization. But in the end you have to push beyond labor,'' he 
said. ``It looks like on the surface that all the chits are in 
labor's hands, but that's not true. Labor has to reverse some tough 
trends in the economy -- so Gore has leverage over them.''

<HEADLINE> Schools Give New Israeli History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Generations of Israeli schoolchildren were  
taught that their nation was born in a miraculous battle between an 
underarmed David and a powerful Goliath. 
</P>
<P>
	Now they're being told that's not so.  
</P>
<P>
	A new crop of school books says the Jewish forces fighting in  
the 1948 Middle East war were better-equipped and trained than 
their Arab enemies. 
</P>
<P>
	Challenging other long-standing assertions, the books also say  
some Palestinians were forced to flee during the fighting, rather 
than leaving voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
	They have unleashed a storm of criticism and debate, with some  
critics saying the books distort historical events. Others say they 
will hurt the morale of Israel's soldiers, undermine the confidence 
of its people and undercut its position in upcoming peace talks 
with the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
	``The presentation of the Jews as bearing responsibility for the  
plight of the Arab refugees will increase world pressure to allow 
those refugees to reenter Israel and destroy our demographic 
shield,'' wrote liberal commentator Dan Margalit. 
</P>
<P>
	But Education Minister Yossi Sarid, of the left-wing Meretz  
Party, insisted Israel is strong enough to face unpleasant truths. 
</P>
<P>
	``The existence of the country is an established fact, so we  
don't need these myths anymore,'' he said. ``The students won't 
love the country any less.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sarid has urged classroom discussions on a 1956 massacre of 47  
Arab civilians from the village of Kfar Kassem, who were shot by 
Israeli border policemen for breaking a curfew. The troops were 
later convicted of murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarid said students should be taught to distinguish between  
legal and illegal orders and learn to deal openly with shameful 
events of the past. 
</P>
<P>
	The new textbooks, introduced in the public school system this  
fall, draw from the research of the country's so-called new 
historians who paint a less romantic picture of Israeli history 
than their colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
	In ``The Twentieth Century,'' Tel Aviv University history  
professor Eyal Naveh contends that in the 1948 Middle East war, 
Jewish forces had the upper hand from the start. 
</P>
<P>
	``On almost every front and in every battle the Jewish side had  
an advantage over the Arabs with respect to planning, organization 
and the operation of equipment, as well as with respect to the 
number of trained soldiers taking part in the battle,'' Naveh 
writes. 
</P>
<P>
	The textbooks also say some Palestinians were forcibly expelled,  
challenging the contention that hundreds of thousands who fled were 
responding to calls by Arab leaders to clear out so Arab armies 
could massacre Jews. 
</P>
<P>
	The textbook ``Journey to the Past'' says that an attack by  
Jewish militiamen on the Palestinian village of Deir Yassin 
accelerated the exodus. Anywhere from 100 to 250 villagers were 
killed in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``This attack led to deep shock in the Arab community and  
increased the terrified escape of many of them from areas conquered 
by the Jews,'' the book says. 
</P>
<P>
	History teacher Hannah Tzriker said she preferred the new books  
to the old ones. 
</P>
<P>
	``We live in this region and it's important that we know what  
happened to our neighbors,'' Tzriker said. ``The books talk about 
the failures and don't present everything in rose-colored hues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palestinian historian Adel Manna said the new books were a  
welcome Israeli look at the Palestinian side of the historical 
narrative. 
</P>
<P>
	``These (issues) were well known things in academia but much  
less known in the education system,'' Manna said, ``It's a new 
sign, a good sign, that we are now speaking about a new atmosphere 
in the schools.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But others believe the texts should be shelved.  
</P>
<P>
	Nadia Matar, who heads ``Women in Green,'' a grassroots group  
opposed to making concessions to the Arabs, has circulated a 
petition calling for a ban of Naveh's book. 
</P>
<P>
	``What kind of generation are we educating with these books?  
They (the students) will feel no love or connection to their land. 
They will feel as if we have taken land from someone else, which is 
not true,'' Matar said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Naveh said Israel is ready for a more balanced view.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think Israel is strong enough after 50 years of enormous  
developments and achievements to ... realize that great victories 
were made and great calamities were suffered by the other side,'' 
Naveh said.

<HEADLINE> Doctor Defends Detox Procedure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHERRY HILL, N.J. (AP) -- A doctor who agreed to stop treating  
heroin addicts with a procedure linked by state investigators to 
the deaths of six patients insisted the practice helped thousands 
kick the habit. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Lance Gooberman reached an agreement Wednesday with the  
state Board of Medical Examiners that temporarily bars him from 
performing the treatment in his clinic in a Philadelphia suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	He is among only a dozen doctors in the country to perform the  
treatment touted as a swift and relatively painless cure for heroin 
addicts who are anesthetized while drugs cleanse their brain of 
heroin. 
</P>
<P>
	The treatment costs $2,900 to $3,600 and is not covered by most  
health insurance plans. 
</P>
<P>
	In a complaint filed earlier this month, the state said the  
treatment is too risky and cited the deaths of six people who 
underwent the procedure. It accused Gooberman and his associate, 
Dr. David Bradway, of serious lapses in medical care and criticized 
their use of the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
	The patients died less than three days after receiving the  
treatment, known as Ultra Rapid Opiate Detoxification, according to 
the complaint. The deaths occurred between 1995 and last June. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing ultra about ultra detox was the risk to the  
health of the patients,'' Mark Herr, director of the state Division 
of Consumer Affairs, said Thursday. ``This is a treatment that is 
not medically established nor recognized.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state is seeking civil penalties and revocation or  
suspension of both doctors' medical licenses. Their lawyer says she 
will oppose those attempts at an administrative hearing. A date has 
not been set. 
</P>
<P>
	Gooberman estimates he has performed the ultra rapid detox on  
2,300 patients at his Merchantville clinic since 1995 with few 
incidents. His lawyer says there is no evidence the deaths were 
caused by the treatment, and claims at least two deaths were 
related to subsequent cocaine use by the patients. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are thousands of them being performed all over the  
world,'' Gooberman said. ``I was trying to help patients to the 
best of my ability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two heroin addicts who joined Gooberman at a news conference  
praised the doctor and the technique. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it wasn't for him, I don't know where I'd be right now,''  
said 20-year-old Stephanie, who said she began shooting up when she 
was 15. She spoke on the condition her last name not be used. ``I 
kept trying and trying to get clean.''

<HEADLINE> Retiree Pleads Innocent to Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- A 75-year-old man has pleaded innocent to  
charges that he gave his terminally ill wife a fatal dose of 
medication and then put her in a car with the engine running and 
garage door shut. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas May sat with his 69-year-old wife, Hazel, and passed out  
from the fumes, police said. He awoke five hours later and called 
their daughter, who contacted authorities. The couple had been 
married 46 years. 
</P>
<P>
	May pleaded innocent to a murder charge Thursday and was ordered  
held without bail. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Robert Madruga said there was no evidence the death  
was an assisted suicide, as May told police when he was arrested 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``She never at any time to our knowledge indicated a desire to  
die,'' Madruga said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the scene, May told police that his wife, who was in the late  
stages of Lou Gehrig's disease, left notes that suggested she 
wanted to die. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor asked Superior Court Judge Roger Kraul to order  
May held without bail in part out of fear he would attempt to take 
his own life. 
</P>
<P>
	Madruga said he interviewed the couple's three grown children,  
reviewed notes left at the scene and decided to file a murder 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
	May has no criminal record. He retired from the Navy as a  
commander in 1975 after a 20-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Jo Barr, a court-appointed public defender, said the  
children may not have known their mother's true wishes and that the 
notes are ``subject to interpretation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is a mercy killing,'' Barr said. ``Some people  
would call that murder. I wouldn't.''

<HEADLINE> Arkansas Arena To Open Oct. 28 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORTH LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- The new civic arena, its opening  
postponed hours before its first event because of questions about 
its integrity, will open Oct. 23 for a minor-league hockey game. 
</P>
<P>
	Arena board chairman Bob Russell said during a news conference  
Thursday that the 18,000-seat Alltel Arena would be cleared for 
occupancy by the time the Arkansas RiverBlades play host to New 
Orleans for a hockey game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be open and it will be safe,'' Russell said.  
</P>
<P>
	The building was scheduled to open Tuesday night with an NBA  
exhibition game between Washington and the Los Angeles Lakers. But 
the board opted to cancel the game when engineers said they had 
questions about beams supporting the upper deck. The questions were 
raised after engineers took remedial action to support a concrete 
beam in which steel bars had been placed lower than they were 
supposed to have been. 
</P>
<P>
	Engineers plan to perform tests similar to ultrasounds on the  
beams to determine if any of the metal rods within them are 
misplaced, as they were in a beam that cracked and caused 
cancellation of Tuesday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell said the tests would be conducted overnight and should  
be completed by Friday morning. Any beams found to be deficient 
will either be braced with steel plates or with a carbon-fiber wrap 
similar to that used on buildings in earthquake zones. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the electronic tests, engineers also plan to  
proceed with weight tests -- but not on all 22 beams supporting the 
upper deck. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell said three beams cleared by the electronic tests will be  
chosen for the weight tests, which includes placing water jugs on 
the overhang and attaching large water balloons to the underside of 
the concrete beams. 
</P>
<P>
	Tests on those three beams should be complete by Tuesday, said  
Gus Vratsinas, chief executive officer of the Vratsinas 
Construction Co., a partner in the joint venture building the 
arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Safety codes require that the arena hold a weight equivalent to  
a 325-pound person in each seat. Vratsinas said the weight test 
would be the equivalent of placing a 550-pound person in each seat. 
</P>
<P>
	Vratsinas said it would cost about $100,000 to perform the  
electronic and weight tests. An engineering firm not associated 
with the building would review the results. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell said taxpayers won't pay the cost of the extra tests and  
repairs. The arena was funded in part by taxpayer dollars after a 
temporary one-cent sales tax was approved in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The state chipped in $20 million for the $80 million arena.  
Private sources contributed $17 million, including $7 million from 
Alltel to put its name on the arena.

<HEADLINE> Hasbro Revenues Soar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Hasbro Inc.'s third-quarter earnings  
climbed about 40 percent from a year ago, driven by demand for its 
Furby dolls, computer games and toys tied to ``Star Wars'' and 
Pokemon. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's second-largest toymaker earned $85 million, or 43  
cents a share, in the quarter ended Sept. 26, compared with $61 
million, or 30 cents a share, a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 results included a $13.6 million charge tied to its  
purchase of MicroProse Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales grew to $1.09 billion from $945.5 million for the same  
period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasbro's earnings matched Wall Street analysts' expectations.  
Its stock, however, fell $1.68 3/4, or 8 percent, to $19.25 in trading 
on the New York Stock Exchange amid concerns that its earnings' 
growth will slow in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
	It's been a strong year for Hasbro, thanks to the popularity of  
many of its products. While sales at Hasbro have soared, its rival 
-- No. 1 toymaker Mattel -- has disappointed Wall Street with weak 
sales and earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Furby, which was the blockbuster hit of last Christmas,  
continues to sell well, and the line of talking, furry dolls was 
extended during the third quarter to include Furby Babies. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of its toys tied to ``Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom  
Menace'' have also been strong and it has seen double-digit sales 
growth in its Hasbro Interactive division, which makes computer 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Also lifting earnings are its toys based on the popular Japanese  
cartoon Pokemon, including plush dolls and games. Hasbro will 
significantly expand its Pokemon line during the fourth quarter, 
including a new Pokemon Monopoly game and a Pokemon electronic 
organizer. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasbro also plans more growth in the Pokemon category thanks to  
its $325 million purchase last month of Wizards of the Coast, which 
sells Pokemon cards as well as the popular games, Magic: The 
Gathering and Dungeons &AMP; Dragons. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of the year, Hasbro earned $131.3  
million, or 64 cents a share, compared with $88.2 million, or 36 
cents a share. Sales were $2.6 billion, up from $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasbro, which is based in Pawtucket, R.I., makes toys under the  
Playskool, Kenner, Tonka, Milton Bradley, Parker Brothers, Tiger 
and Galoob toy and game brands.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Will Makes Nukes An Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrats are pledging to make Senate  
rejection of a historic nuclear test ban treaty a political issue 
for 2000. Republican opponents of the pact call it fatally flawed 
and dispute that the vote will command much campaign attention. 
</P>
<P>
	On a largely party line vote, the Senate defeated the  
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty late Wednesday, 51-48. Only four 
Senate Republicans voted for the treaty. The United States thus 
became the first nuclear power to specifically reject the 
154-nation agreement on ending nuclear weapons testing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I assure you the fight is far from over,'' Clinton said after  
the vote. He said he still would encourage other countries to 
ratify the treaty and predicted eventual U.S. support. The 1996 
treaty cannot take effect without U.S. ratification. 
</P>
<P>
	But few on either side of the political aisle expected to see  
another vote on the treaty anytime soon in the 
Republican-controlled Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't take long for Democrats to promise to try to convert  
their embarrassing defeat -- the test ban treaty had been a top 
Clinton administration foreign policy priority -- into a political 
attack on Republicans both in the presidential and congressional 
races. 
</P>
<P>
	They claimed polls show most Americans favor such a ban -- first  
proposed by President Dwight Eisenhower in 1958 and endorsed, in 
various forms, by every president since. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect that this should be and will be a national issue  
next year in the presidential elections,'' said Senate Minority 
Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D. Other Democrats said campaign ads 
already were being envisioned to use against GOP incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
	And, campaigning in Seattle, Vice President Al Gore called the  
Senate vote ``an act of almost breathtaking irresponsibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not the last word on this subject from the American  
people because I intend to make in this an issue in my campaign for 
president and my first act as president will be to resubmit this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush has condemned  
the treaty, as have Elizabeth Dole and the three Senate Republicans 
who are presidential hopefuls: John McCain, R-Ariz.; Orrin Hatch, 
R-Utah; and Bob Smith, Ind-N.H. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, one of a small band of conservatives who managed to block  
efforts by more moderate Republicans to put off a vote, said after 
Wednesday night's vote that he wasn't surprised Democrats would 
seek to make the rejection a big campaign issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, that's the way it is in politics,'' he said. He  
said the vote was the right course. ``It's better to be definitive 
than to delay,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the Senate majority leader, said he  
doubted that Democrats could turn the Senate rejection into a 
winning campaign issue because ``this one is not a close call.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He portrayed the treaty as badly flawed and said, ``The American  
people are smarter than they (Democrats) give them credit for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents argued the treaty was not verifiable and would not  
stop the nuclear ambitions of North Korea and Iran. Further, they 
argued it would harm efforts to maintain the safety and reliability 
of the U.S. nuclear arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
	After the vote, Clinton, who became the first leader to sign the  
treaty in 1996, said: ``Never before has a serious treaty involving 
nuclear weapons been handled in such a reckless and ultimately 
partisan way. This was a political deal, and I hope it will get the 
treatment from the American people it richly deserves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time the Senate has ever rejected an arms  
control treaty and the first time any treaty had been rejected 
since an unpopular agreement dealing with airline overflight rights 
and exposure to international lawsuits had been rejected in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate had been closely watched around the world by other  
nuclear powers. 
</P>
<P>
	``With this vote tonight, the world becomes a more dangerous  
place,'' declared Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, the senior Democrat 
on the Senate Armed Services Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Levin suggested the reaction would not only make it easier for  
other nations to resume or initiate testing, but that it could make 
it less likely that Russia would ratify an existing arms control 
treaty -- START II -- presently before its parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	But GOP leaders blamed the Clinton administration and Senate  
Democrats for complaining about lack of Senate action on the pact 
so much that they had no choice but to call their bluff and 
schedule a vote. 
</P>
<P>
	After sitting on the treaty for two years, Lott and Senate  
Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms, R-N.C., suddenly 
brought the measure to the floor for a vote, knowing that it would 
be rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the treaty was signed by 154 nations, including the  
United States, it has been ratified by only 26 of the 44 
nuclear-capable states that must approve it to put it into force. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott, meanwhile, said he had written a letter to Defense  
Secretary William Cohen ``asking that he initiate a comprehensive 
review of the state of the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile, 
infrastructure, management, personnel, training, delivery systems 
and related matters.''

<HEADLINE> E. Coli Poisons 5 Okla. Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TULSA, Okla. (AP) -- At least five children have fallen ill with  
E. coli poisoning after drinking unpasteurized apple cider, 
including a 4-year-old girl whose kidneys failed, health 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl remained in critical condition today. The other  
children, between 2 and 11 years old, were treated and released. 
Four other children are believed to have contracted the bacteria 
but it hasn't been confirmed, said Dr. Mike Crutcher, state 
epidemiologist with the state Health Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The department warned northeastern Oklahoma residents not to  
drink unpasteurized apple cider from Livesay Orchards in Porter. It 
is marketed only in the Tulsa area. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every case that we have had so far has drank the cider,''  
Crutcher said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is an unfortunate thing, but first of all, I'm very  
concerned about the safety of children,'' orchard co-owner Ken 
Livesay said today. ``We've been making cider for almost 20 years 
and this is the first time there's been any suspicion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dangerous strain of E. coli is usually found in the  
intestines or manure of cattle. People who ingest it can suffer 
severe cramps, bloody diarrhea and, in extreme cases, kidney 
failure.

	NORFOLK, Neb. (AP) -- Johnny Carson's hometown honored its famous  
native son with a billboard sporting a huge computer-generated

signature introduction from ``The Tonight Show'' -- after Mayor 
Harley Rector unveiled the sign Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a happy day for Norfolk,'' said Denny Reeves, dressed in

<HEADLINE> First Union's Profits Fall 19 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE (AP) -- First Union Corp. reported Thursday that  
profits slid 19 percent in the third quarter as mortgages and other 
fees declined from year-ago levels. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's sixth-largest bank posted net income of $802  
million, or 84 cents a share, matching Wall Street's forecast, 
which had been lowered twice in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	First Union earned $995 million, or $1.01 a share, during the  
same period last year. Those results, however, included a one-time 
charge for the cost of buying of CoreStates Financial Corp. 
Excluding that charge, the earnings drop was even steeper -- 21 
percent, down from $1.01 billion, or $1.02 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Many investors were disappointed, and sent First Union's stock  
down $1.18 3/4 to $35.081 1/4 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
The Charlotte, N.C.,-based bank has seen its shares tumble 45 
percent from their highs at the beginning of the year, as 
executives have failed to deliver the synergies from the CoreStates 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue from fees for loans and other services fell 5 percent in  
the quarter to $1.52 billion. Mortgages and other loans fell 3 
percent to $131 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank officials, however, appeared heartened by the results.  
</P>
<P>
	``Our performance in the third quarter of 1999 was solid and in  
line with our expectations,'' Edward E. Crutchfield, First Union's 
chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement. ``Our 
diversified business model continues to produce balanced results.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the first nine months of this year, earnings surged 17  
percent, to $2.38 billion, or $2.47 a share, from $2.03 billion, or 
$2.08 a share this year. Excluding last year's merger-related 
costs, however, the earnings fell 2 percent from last year's $2.64 
billion, or $2.74 a share. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> FAA Urged To Untangle Air Traffic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's air travelers face more delays  
unless the Federal Aviation Administration takes quick action to 
untangle traffic jams in the skies, according to a report released 
today by air carriers. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it is not fixed, the resulting delays will virtually  
eliminate the dependability of airline schedules and the system 
will descend into gridlock,'' the Air Transport Association, which 
represents major air carriers, wrote in a report released today. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA said it is moving as fast as it can to straighten out a  
complex and outdated system plagued by weather problems this year. 
The agency has conceded equipment problems and decentralized 
decision-making increased delays this year and told a House 
committee today that the agency is taking the quickest possible 
action to install a national air traffic control system to better 
coordinate planes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The FAA is willing to do whatever is within our power to  
improve the efficiency of the air traffic system, so long as safety 
is not compromised,'' FAA Administrator Jane Garvey told the House 
Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	In its report, the trade group forecast that by 2008, the number  
of passengers will rise 43 percent and an additional 2,500 planes 
will be needed to transport those people. With the current system 
in place, the additional traffic would cause a 250 percent rise in 
delays, the group said. 
</P>
<P>
	From April through August this year, delays rose 36 percent, a  
figure federal officials largely blamed on weather. The delays 
intensified the fight between air traffic controllers, airlines and 
the federal government over who is responsible and how to fix the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, delays cost airlines and fliers $4.5 billion, the  
report estimates. More than 100,000 people were delayed each day, 
it said, with fliers in Dallas-Fort Worth, Chicago O'Hare and 
Detroit airports least likely to fly on time.

<HEADLINE> NJ Man Beats Electronic Monitoring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Police say a man under house arrest managed  
to extend the range of his electronic monitoring bracelet to enable 
him to get outside his apartment and sell drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman Hill, 31, used a series of telephone extension cords to  
move the system's base unit to the doorway of his apartment -- much 
further than it was supposed to reach, said police Sgt. Derek 
Glenn. 
</P>
<P>
	That, in turn, enabled Hill to leave his apartment without  
triggering an alarm to authorities that he had gone outside. 
</P>
<P>
	Glenn said undercover officers bought heroin from Hill on  
Thursday and then arrested him. He was charged with narcotics 
possession and distribution, possession with intent to distribute, 
and possession and distribution within a school zone.

	Clinton Assails GOP Over Test Ban Treaty  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton accused Senate Republicans  
of recklessness today for defeating the nuclear test ban treaty and 
warned, ``You'll see a lot of testing'' by Russia, China, India and 
Pakistan if the United States abandons the landmark agreement. 
Clinton pledged the United States would refrain from testing -- as 
it has since 1992 -- despite the treaty's rejection. Clinton, at a 
news conference a day after the test ban treaty failed on a 51-48 
Senate vote, said Republicans have fallen into ``a new 
isolationism'' and had voted on the basis of partisan politics.

	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- The head of Pakistan's military  
declared himself the country's leader Friday. Gen. Pervaiz 
Musharraf issued an order for a state of emergency, dissolving 
parliament and suspending the constitution. The proclamation 
dismissed all cabinet ministers and the Senate chairman, as well as 
the governors of Pakistan's four provinces and their ministers. 
Troops ousted Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Tuesday. World 
governments -- worried at the prospect of military rule in a 
nuclear-armed nation -- have been pressing Musharraf to reinstate 
democracy, even if he does not bring back Sharif.

queen's killer. He also said the girl's parents, John and Patsy

Irene -- which had sustained winds of 75 mph -- was centered about 65 
miles southwest of Havana, and was moving north-northwest at 7 mph. 
The edge of the storm battered Miami with rain, A hurricane watch

out of Hungary to be sold, taken by American generals or turned 
over to Austria instead of returned to the Jews from whom it was 
confiscated during World War II, a presidential commission 
concluded today. The report listed five U.S. generals who took 
valuables. The items were seized shortly after the May 7, 1945, 
Allied victory in Europe, the commission said. The commission was 
set up to advise the president on the fate of Holocaust victims'

	GM Earns $877M in Third Quarter

	DETROIT (AP) -- Thanks to strong sales in the United States and a  
return of labor peace, General Motors Corp. earned $877 million in 
the third quarter, reversing a loss from last year's strike-plagued 
period. GM's results beat the predictions of Wall Street analysts. 
Sales totaled $42.8 billion, compared with adjusted revenue of 
$33.5 billion a year ago. GM -- the world's largest automaker -- saw 
its stock close down 12 1/2 cents at $65 a share on the New York Stock

Supplies in the last several months have been constrained for a

<HEADLINE> Trump Casino Holds Liquidation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- Trump World's Fair Casino was more  
like the Trump flea market Thursday: TVs were going for $159, 
standup lamps for $45, alarm clocks for $10, blankets for $5, 
pillows for $1. 
</P>
<P>
	The only thing missing was Donald J. Trump himself, shouting  
through a bullhorn: ``Everything must go in my biggest, best 
liquidation sale ever. The prices are insaaaaane!'' 
</P>
<P>
	A monthlong sale aimed at preparing the casino for the wrecking  
ball kicked off Thursday, with bargain hunters and souvenir 
collectors converging on the 22-story Boardwalk tower, cash and 
credit cards in hand. 
</P>
<P>
	The lobby looked like a hastily opened furniture showroom.  
Everything had a price tag on it. Customers also were free to roam 
the 500-room hotel in search of chairs, pictures, clock radios and 
other items. Blackjack tables, slot machines and other gambling 
devices were off-limits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came looking for a wet bar for my house, but they were too  
big,'' said Tom Breuel, 42, who was waiting in line to pay for a 
wastepaper basket, an ice bucket and two standup lamps. ``I'll 
probably come back again. It's cheaper than I'd get these things in 
a store.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The awkwardly designed casino, which opened in 1981 as the  
Playboy and later operated as the Atlantis, has always bled money. 
It was forced into bankruptcy in 1989. Trump bought it for $63 
million and operated it as a non-casino hotel -- Trump Regency -- for 
years before investing $48 million and reopening it in 1996 as 
Trump World's Fair Casino. 
</P>
<P>
	It was losing $10 million a year by the time Trump decided to  
demolish it and start over.

	GM Earns $877 Million  
</P>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp. reported today that sales in  
North America and earnings from its finance arm pushed operating 
profit for the world's largest automaker to $877 million in the 
third quarter, reversing a strike-related loss from a year ago. GM 
earned $1.33 a share, compared with a loss of $309 million, or 52 
cents a share, for the July-through-September period of 1998, after 
excluding earnings from GM's former parts unit, Delphi Automotive 
Systems. Delphi, the world's largest automotive parts maker, was 
split off from GM in May as an independent company. The results 
beat the prediction of $1.24 a share by 13 Wall Street analysts, 
according to a survey by First Call/Thomson Financial.

S.A. to create what would likely be the world's third-biggest 
aerospace company, DaimlerChrysler announced today. German 
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and French Prime Minister Lionel 
Jospin were to attend a news conference with officials from the two 
companies in Strasbourg, France, later today. The long-rumored deal

	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's Sumitomo Bank and Sakura Bank announced  
today that they will merge, forming what is expected to be the 
world's second-largest bank. The announcement comes just two months 
after three other major Japanese banks announced plans for a merger 
to create the largest banking group in the world. Even before the 
merger was officially announced, government officials were already 
cheering the news. Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the merger 
would be good for the Japanese economy. The new bank is expected to 
have about $935 billion in total funds. The combination would 
create a financial giant second only to the entity formed by the 
planned merger of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Fuji Bank and Industrial 
Bank of Japan Ltd.

	Consumers Paying Higher Bank Fees

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- People who do not maintain a minimum balance  
in their checking accounts are paying an average $217.32 a year in 
various bank charges, up from $199.79 two years ago, a new survey 
finds. And consumers with accounts at big banks are paying on 
average 16 percent more for them than customers of smaller banks, 
the U.S. Public Interest Research Group said in its latest annual 
survey of bank fees. An official of the American Bankers 
Association called the consumer group's findings ``completely 
misleading.'' ``Most people figure out a way to reduce the cost'' 
of a checking account, often by having their paychecks deposited 
automatically into their accounts, James Chessen, chief economist 
of the bankers' group, said.

	Retail Sales Rise in September

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Retail sales rose just 0.1 percent in  
September as Americans pulled in their spending somewhat on cars 
and clothing from last month's buying frenzy. Total retail sales 
rose last month to a seasonally adjusted $253.4 billion, the 
Commerce Department said today. That was slightly worse than the 
0.2 percent increase many analysts were forecasting. The September 
increase followed a revised 1.5 percent gain in August, better than 
the 1.2 percent the government previously estimated.

Michel Camdessus let his early resignation be understood during a 
conversation with Le Monde at a showing of the documentary film 
``Le Pouvoir FMI'' (IMF Power), the paper said. He stressed that 
the IMF General Assembly, held in Washington in September, allowed 
him to finish up a number of issues close to his heart, such as the 
Asian crisis, in which he orchestrated multibillion dollar rescue 
packages for Asian economies, and the program for debt reduction

General Electric Corp.'s NBC unit, according to a person familiar

	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Apple Computer Inc. closed out its fiscal  
year with an eighth straight quarterly profit, topping Wall Street 
forecasts that were trimmed after last month's warning about a chip 
shortage for the Power Mac G4. The company reported net income of 
$111 million, or 63 cents a share, for its fourth quarter ended 
Sept. 25. But excluding a gain of $37 million from an investment 
and other one-time factors, Apple earned $90 million, or 51 cents a 
share -- a drop of 15 percent from last year's net profit of $106 
million, or 68 cents a share. Still, the computer maker skated past 
analysts' deflated forecasts for a fourth-quarter operating profit

company reported yesterday its earnings were equivalent to 27 cents 
per share and compared to a loss of $37 million, or 3 cents a

12,486.82. The Hang Seng had lost 4.9 percent over the past three

Intel, often considered a bellwether stock for the technology

<HEADLINE> Prosecutor Admits JonBenet Mistakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- District Attorney Alex Hunter acknowledged  
Thursday that ``mistakes were made'' in the JonBenet Ramsey slaying 
investigation, but fiercely defended his office and said he is by 
no means done searching for the 6-year-old beauty queen's killer. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said the girl's parents, John and Patsy Ramsey, ``have  
not been eliminated from the investigation.'' Police Chief Mark 
Beckner said the Ramseys remain ``under an umbrella of suspicion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter faced a barrage of criticism after announcing Wednesday  
that a 13-month grand jury investigation into the slaying did not 
find enough evidence to charge anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I had to do it again, I might do it a bit differently,'' he  
said at a news conference Thursday. ``I thought I might smoke the 
killer out, and I didn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter refused to discuss the grand jury's investigation,  
including why JonBenet's parents were not called to testify. But he 
said, ``The case is stronger as a result of the work of the grand 
jury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I have an aching heart about where we are with this case, but  
by no means do I or any of the men who you see at this table feel a 
sense of failure,'' Hunter said, flanked by prosecutors who have 
been consulting on the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will continue to follow the evidence in this case as long  
as there is work to be done. We find no reason to give up heart, we 
find no reason to quit, and we plan to continue with diligence the 
effort we believe has been under way since the beginning of this 
case,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Thursday, Gov. Bill Owens said a team of attorneys,  
including Attorney General Ken Salazar, will review the case and 
recommend whether a special prosecutor should be named. Owens said 
he would decide within a week. 
</P>
<P>
	During morning radio talk shows, angry callers lambasted Hunter,  
demanding to know why no one has been charged in the nearly three 
years since JonBenet was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The case is tragic,'' said Kathy Minter, 49, who has lived in  
Boulder for 13 years. ``I think everyone messed up -- the police, 
the media, the tabloids, the Ramseys and the district attorney's 
office. It's very sad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some people defended Hunter and accused police of bungling the  
case and mishandling the evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hunter got stuck with a bad case, and so did the grand  
jurors,'' said Emily Brown, who was playing with two children 
outside the Boulder County Justice Center, where the grand jury 
met. ``It upsets me. I think it's pretty obvious who did it, but 
they'll have to live with the guilt the rest of their lives. I 
don't think there is a crazed killer running around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Early on Dec. 26, 1996, Patsy Ramsey told police she found a  
ransom note demanding $118,000 for her daughter's safe return. 
Eight hours later, JonBenet's father, John, said he found his 
daughter's body in the basement. 
</P>
<P>
	A month and a half after the slaying, Hunter assembled a dream  
team of prosecutors and advisers, including crime scene analyst 
Henry Lee and DNA expert Barry Scheck. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation soon became bogged down with infighting  
between his office and police. Police were accused of mishandling 
the evidence and allowing too many people to have access to the 
crime scene, and Hunter was accused of trying to protect JonBenet's 
wealthy and influential parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter turned the case over to the grand jury in September 1998.  
The grand jurors heard from Lee and Scheck, the police, Ramsey 
friends and associates, JonBenet's brother Burke and her 
half-siblings. 
</P>
<P>
	After the decision not to charge anyone was announced, the  
Ramseys asked police to continue the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We take no satisfaction in this result because a child killer  
remains free and undetected,'' they said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference held two hours after Hunter's, Beckner said  
he agreed that ``there are things that we should have done 
differently and wish we would have done differently.'' But he 
added: ``To say that mistakes have made this an unsolvable case is 
not accurate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This case is not dead in the water,'' Beckner said. ``We still  
have things to do, still have evidence that is being processed and 
examined.''

<HEADLINE> Marathon Recalls Hotdogs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Marathon Enterprises of East Rutherford, N.J.,  
is recalling about 52,000 pounds of hot dogs that may be 
contaminated with listeria bacteria, the Department of Agriculture 
said on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The recalled Sabrett Skinless Beef Frankfurters in 16-ounce  
packages were produced Aug. 20 and distributed in New York, New 
Jersey, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Florida and Georgia, 
according to the department's Food and Safety Inspection Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Food contaminated by the listeria bacteria can cause listerosis,  
an uncommon but potentially fatal disease. Healthy people rarely 
contract the disease, with symptoms like high fever, severe 
headache, neck stiffness and nausea. 
</P>
<P>
	The recalled packages are marked ``sell by Oct. 22 A'' or ``sell  
by Oct. 22 B.'' The labels also bear ``EST 8894'' inside the USDA 
seal of inspection. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of the potential of foodborne illness, we urge  
customers who have purchased the suspect product not to eat it, and 
to return it to the point of purchase,'' said Thomas J.Billy, the 
Food Safety and Inspection Service's administrator.

<HEADLINE> FAA Urged To Untangle Air Traffic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Air travelers will not be able to trust flight  
schedules at all unless federal regulators fix a slew of problems, 
air carriers say. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest round of finger pointing over flight delays this  
year, the Air Transport Association of America is releasing a 
report that blames the Federal Aviation Administration for an 
increase in delays. 
</P>
<P>
	``The FAA's system is broken,'' said the report made public by  
the House Transportation Committee. ``If it is not fixed, the 
resulting delays will virtually eliminate the dependability of 
airline schedules and the system will descend into gridlock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	FAA Administrator Jane Garvey told lawmakers Thursday that the  
government is doing the best it can to fix a complex and outdated 
system plagued by unusual weather problems this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The FAA is willing to do whatever is within our power to  
improve the efficiency of the air traffic system, so long as safety 
is not compromised,'' Garvey said. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade group predicted that by 2008, the number of passengers  
will increase 43 percent and 2,500 more planes will be needed. With 
the current system in place, the additional traffic would cause a 
250 percent rise in delays, the group said. 
</P>
<P>
	From April through August this year, delays rose 36 percent, a  
figure federal officials largely blamed on weather. The delays 
intensified the fight among air traffic controllers, airlines and 
the federal government over who is responsible and how to fix the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, delays cost airlines and fliers $4.5 billion, the  
report estimates. More than 100,000 people were delayed each day, 
it said, with fliers in Dallas-Fort Worth, Chicago O'Hare and 
Detroit airports least likely to fly on time. 
</P>
<P>
	Air traffic controllers say airlines cause much of the problem  
by scheduling more flights into some airports than can land, 
causing a backup. The airline report contends delays attributed to 
a large number of scheduled flights amounted to only 7.5 percent of 
all air traffic delays. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA, meanwhile, says weather problems account for 75 percent  
of delays. 
</P>
<P>
	The House and Senate are in negotiations on two versions of a  
bill that would provide millions of dollars to build runways and 
other facilities to handle large volumes of flights and passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	But the shortage of facilities is only part of the problem,  
Garvey said. Her agency is in the midst of a $13 billion 
modernization program to update air traffic monitoring systems and 
to find ways to deal with bad weather and a booming regional 
airport industry. She said the modernization will take about eight 
years, and travelers in the East should see benefits within five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The improvements include upgrading FAA computers and displays in  
key traffic control centers. The agency also is studying technology 
that would free pilots from the limits of the existing system of 
aerial highways and let pilots take routes they select. 
</P>
<P>
	The air carrier report recommends the FAA modernize the air  
traffic control system, react more flexibly to weather problems and 
install procedures and technologies that allow more planes to land 
and take off.

<HEADLINE> Children Hurt in Ark. Bus Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- More than 30 middle school students  
were injured when their school bus was wedged between a 
tractor-trailer and a concrete median on a downtown expressway. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Bonner, a spokesman for Arkansas Children's Hospital, said  
three students were listed in serious condition and would be kept 
overnight -- two with head injuries and one with an abdominal 
injury. In all, 33 students were brought to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	But most of the children had bumps and scratches after  
Wednesday's accident, Assistant Fire Chief Al Davis said. The truck 
driver was hospitalized in serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said the children escaped through the bus' rear emergency  
door and crossed three eastbound lanes of rush hour traffic to the 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the crash wasn't immediately known. The front of  
the tractor-trailer was turned left in front of the bus, holding it 
against the median. 
</P>
<P>
	A state police report said the driver of the tractor-trailer,  
Roy Dollarhide, swerved to avoid hitting traffic ahead of him when 
he had to make a sudden stop. The report said the truck sideswiped 
a pickup truck and swerved into the path of the bus.

<HEADLINE> Aerospace Firms To Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- DASA AG, the German aerospace unit of  
DaimlerChrysler AG, plans to merge with France's Aerospatiale Matra 
S.A. to create Europe's biggest aerospace company and the 
third-largest in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced today comes amid a wave of consolidation in  
Europe's aerospace industry which is trying to remain competitive 
against the industry's two biggest manufacturers, Boeing Co. and 
Lockheed Martin Corp. of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	European companies already cooperate in building Airbus  
passenger jets and military jets like the Eurofighter and Tornado. 
But industry insiders fear that unless they pool their skills, 
finances and research more closely, they will be acquired by U.S. 
companies eager to expand into European markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be the driving force in the aerospace sector just as  
we are in the automotive industry,'' DaimlerChrysler co-chairman 
Juergen Schrempp said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	In a sign of the importance European leaders place on the deal,  
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and French Prime Minister 
Lionel Jospin attended the signing ceremony in Strasbourg, adding 
their signatures as witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Both leaders heralded the merger as a critical and natural step  
as European institutions become more tightly entwined. 
</P>
<P>
	``European integration is going forward in many areas --  
employment, the euro, foreign and security policies,'' Jospin said. 
``It is not possible that an industry in such an important sector 
is left behind. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today's sucess shows that German-French cooperation is the  
inexhaustible motor for European unity,'' the French leader said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder echoed the theme, saying the merger ``is expression  
for the fact that our two countries wish to face the challenges of 
the future together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the heart of the merger between the two roughly equal  
companies lie their hefty stakes in Airbus Industrie, the No. 2 
civilian aircraft maker after Boeing. 
</P>
<P>
	Including the tiny Spanish aerospace company CASA, which is  
currently being merged with DASA, the new firm will have an 80 
percent stake in Airbus. The remaining 20 percent is held by the 
fourth partner, British Aerospace, which welcomed the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the deal should help push forward protracted  
discussions on transforming the Airbus consortium into a private 
company, now that the Germans and French will presumably be acting 
as one. 
</P>
<P>
	But difficult issues such as agreeing on the value of Airbus  
assets to be pooled, management structure and how to deal with the 
loss of its tax-free status remain. 
</P>
<P>
	The merged German-French firm, to be called European Aeronautic,  
Defense and Space Co. (EADS), also will make helicopters through 
Eurocopter, operate the Ariane satellite launching system and 
provide satellites, military aircraft and defense systems. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler expects to get the necessary regulatory approval  
to allow the new aerospace company to begin operating in the first 
half of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler will own 30 percent of the new company while the  
French Lagardere Group and the French government, which control 
Aerospatiale Matra, will own another combined 30 percent. The 
remaining 40 percent will be sold on the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	Jospin's office said ownership of the French stake will be  
divided with 50 percent held by the state, 37 percent by Lagardere 
and the rest by unnamed French investors. The French government 
plans to reduce its stake later to 15 percent through a secondary 
share offering, DaimlerChrysler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both DaimlerChrysler and Lagardere and partner British Aerospace  
called the creation of EADS a big step toward converting Airbus 
into a ``truly integrated'' private company. Lagardere said that 
British Aerospace has been asked to join the future Airbus. 
</P>
<P>
	``The merger is a very helpful step towards the creation of the  
Airbus single corporate entity,'' British Aerospace said. 
</P>
<P>
	The three companies have said they were reviewing the  
possibility of two pooling their Airbus stake into a holding 
company, while the third partner would join at a later stage. 
</P>
<P>
	Aerospatiale Matra's own merger earlier this year was seen as  
aiding the transformation process by reducing the French 
government's stake in the French partner to less than half, 48 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler spokesman Eckhard Zanger declined to elaborate  
on the plans for Airbus. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing is the world's largest aerospace company with annual  
revenue of $64 billion followed by Lockheed Martin with $26.8 
billion. DaimlerChrysler said the new firm EADS would have combined 
revenue of $22.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	It will have 89,000 employees and dual headquarters in Paris and  
Munich, where DASA is based.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Discusses Endorsement Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- Democratic presidential candidate Bill  
Bradley dismissed concerns Thursday that losing the AFL-CIO 
endorsement was a blow to his campaign, saying it was more an 
example of Vice President Al Gore's ``entrenched power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Would I rather have had it? Sure. But is the loss of it a  
serious blow? No, I don't think so,'' Bradley said after promoting 
his health care plan in Orange County's poorest area. ``My opponent 
has entrenched power on his side, and I think that affected the 
decision on the part of the AFL-CIO.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore won the endorsement Wednesday, but it was far from  
unanimous as the Teamsters -- the largest of the AFL-CIO's 68 union 
affiliates -- and United Auto Workers broke ranks in opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, a former U.S. senator from New Jersey, also said he had  
spoken with Teamsters President James P. Hoffa and UAW officials 
since the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``We continue to have discussions. I think they have always  
maintained they wanted to see neutrality and how the campaign 
evolved,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In crucial early primary states such as New Hampshire and New  
York, where Bradley has edged ahead of or tied Gore in the polls, 
mass mobilization by union members could tip the scales to the vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bradley said the lost endorsement would not change his  
approach. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to continue to reach out to people and pay my  
respects to working families and to the very union leaders who 
might have gone the other way,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> USDA Discrimination Discouraged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Thousands of claims that black farmers are  
filing in the settlement of a civil rights lawsuit will be 
investigated to determine which Agriculture Department employees 
may have been involved in the discrimination, an official said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In appropriate places, we will recommend disciplinary  
action,'' said Rosalind Gray, the department's civil rights 
director. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, which was settled in April, alleged that the  
department for years systematically denied loans and other 
assistance to black farmers. Some 15,000 people have filed claims 
so far. Lawmakers and lawyers have estimated the settlement could 
cost $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past two years, five workers have been fired as a  
result of discrimination complaints and 41 others disciplined. 
</P>
<P>
	The department is ``making solid progress toward improving civil  
rights,'' although it is ``taking longer than we had hoped,'' Gray 
told a House Agriculture subcommittee Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	But lawmakers said that the department hasn't moved fast enough  
to root out problem employees and administrators. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those who are responsible must be held accountable,'' said  
Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Texas. ``We cannot tolerate a system that 
fosters discrimination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Advocates for the farmers say that much of the problem is in the  
county offices of USDA's Farm Service Agency, and that USDA 
officials have done little to rein in those employees. Those 
offices, where farmers apply for a variety of government programs, 
are managed by locally elected committees. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, an FSA employee in Virginia who was accused of  
brandishing a gun during a meeting with a black farmer was 
suspended for one day rather than fired. The employee admitted 
having a gun in his desk, but USDA officials could not prove he had 
displayed it to the farmer, Gray said. 
</P>
<P>
	John Boyd Jr., president of the National Black Farmers  
Association, said the county system should be abolished. ``Clean 
the slate and start over again. Start with all of the people, not 
just white people,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Earl Hilliard, D-Ala., said there are USDA employees who  
continue to discriminate against black farmers, but he did not 
offer examples. 
</P>
<P>
	The deadline for farmers to file claims in the lawsuit was  
Tuesday, but their lawyers are asking a judge for an extension 
until Oct. 29. Gray said the department would support the 
extension, a reversal of the position the department took earlier 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers with less documented evidence of discrimination can take  
a $50,000 payment, as well as $12,500 to cover taxes, and have 
their government debts forgiven. Farmers with stronger evidence 
will go before an independent arbitrator and seek larger damages.

<HEADLINE> Jets' Atwater Injured in Practice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- Injuries hit the New York Jets again  
Thursday, with safety Steve Atwater sidelined by a hamstring 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Atwater, the free safety signed as a free agent in the offseason  
from the Denver Broncos, was listed as questionable for Sunday's 
game with Indianapolis. The 31-year-old veteran, in his 11th NFL 
season, will be replaced in the starting lineup by Omar Stoutmire, 
who was signed earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Atwater has not played particularly well with the Jets, although  
he had his best two games the last two weeks. He is the sixth 
regular and second member of the secondary to be hurt this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Already gone for the year is cornerback Otis Smith (collarbone).  
Also out for the season are quarterback Vinny Testaverde and kick 
returner-running back Leon Johnson (knee). 
</P>
<P>
	Star receiver Wayne Chrebet missed the first five games with a  
broken left foot, but is expected to return Sunday. Nose tackle 
Jason Ferguson missed three games with an ankle problem and 
returned against Jacksonville on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Linebacker Chad Cascadden, a backup who also is a special teams  
standout, is on injured reserve after tearing up his knee two weeks 
ago.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Covets Trailblazer Image </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- With new laws covering such things as  
assault weapons, overtime, anti-gay harassment and hospital 
staffing, California is moving to reclaim its role as the state 
that blazes the trail for the rest of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``For years America had looked to California to get a glimpse of  
the future,'' Democratic Gov. Gray Davis said. ``We've begun to 
offer leadership once again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis signed measures this year that give California the  
toughest laws in the nation on assault weapons and cheap ``Saturday 
Night Special'' handguns, and the most protective law of workers 
putting in long hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis and the Democratic-controlled Legislature also banned  
harassment of gay students and teachers in public schools and 
colleges. 
</P>
<P>
	Another new law will force hospitals to meet minimum staffing  
levels for nurses, the first requirement of its kind in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis also shifted child support collection from counties to a  
state agency -- an approach most other states already take. But he 
elevated that agency to department level, a nationally 
unprecedented move. 
</P>
<P>
	On a wide range of other issues, the Legislature took the  
nation's most populous state to the cutting edge, though in most 
cases, a few other states were already there. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, California last month became the third state to  
allow patients to sue HMOs for damages in certain cases. 
</P>
<P>
	But that move still illustrated how California can reshape the  
national policy landscape, even when it is a half-step behind. The 
same week Davis signed the HMO bill, President Clinton called on 
Congress to follow California's example and enact a Patients' Bill 
of Rights containing a nearly identical provision on HMOs. The 
House passed the measure on Oct. 7. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why California is influential is as much because of its size  
as because of the novelty of particular actions,'' said Tom Mann, 
director of governmental studies at the Brookings Institution in 
Washington. ``California isn't necessarily at the top of the list 
in innovations. Oftentimes they start elsewhere, but get picked up 
in California, and everyone notices -- because California is 
California.'' 
</P>
<P>
	California's reputation as a pioneering state dates back at  
least 60 years, when it started building the nation's first 
freeways. Other firsts include some of the nation's toughest 
environmental laws, especially in air pollution. Even today, 
automakers produce special ``California cars'' to meet its 
stringent smog laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis got elected last year by campaigning as a centrist,  
promising to borrow ideas from both parties. He won in a landslide 
over Republican Dan Lungren, breaking the GOP's 16-year grip on the 
governor's office. 
</P>
<P>
	But Davis faced another challenge: Pent-up demand among  
Democrats in the Legislature after all those years of conservative 
governors. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis -- pronounced the ``most fearless governor in America''  
last week by Time magazine -- fought bitterly with lawmakers of his 
own party as he sought to keep a flood of liberal legislation from 
reaching his desk. He succeeded in many cases, and vetoed 232 bills 
that did get to him. But he signed a number of other bills that had 
been vetoed again and again by his Republican predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
	Measures hailed as nationally significant include new laws that  
limit gun purchases to one a month, broaden the state's assault 
weapons ban, require guns to have trigger locks and increase 
regulation of gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Other groundbreaking laws and regulations will:  
</P>
<P>
	--Create a domestic partner registry for gay and older couples,  
extending to them hospital visitation rights and, for state and 
local government workers, health benefits for partners. 
</P>
<P>
	--Require employers to provide double pay to employees who work  
more than 12 hours in a day. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Guarantee a spot in the University of California system for  
all students who graduate in the top 4 percent of their high school 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
	--Force health care companies to cover the cost of prescription  
contraceptives. 
</P>
<P>
	--Require that new school buses come equipped with seat belts,  
and that students wear them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this round of legislation is going to have an impact  
on the perception of California, particularly because issues such 
as health care and gun control were dealt with,'' said Mark 
Baldassare of the Public Policy Institute of California. ``Not that 
California necessarily has the answers to all the questions on 
these more pressing issues, but it has made a good start.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Won't Comment on Bradley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton may go to bat a lot for his  
vice president, but when it comes to Al Gore's assessments of Bill 
Bradley, he's trying to stay out of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not a candidate in the Democratic primary, and I do not  
think I should become one,'' Clinton said Thursday when asked 
whether he agreed with Gore's characterizations of Bradley as a 
disloyal Democrat for once considering an independent presidential 
bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he doesn't want to pit one Democrat against  
another. ``I'm not going to get into that kind of horse racing,'' 
he told reporters at an afternoon news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	He went on to praise Gore as ``by far the best vice president in  
history'' and said Gore did the right thing by moving his campaign 
headquarters to his native Tennessee.

<P>
	``And I expect him to win,'' Clinton said. ``But I expect to  
support the nominee of my party, as I always have. And I think that 
I can serve no useful function by talking about anything other than 
issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As part of his new, improved campaign image, Gore has criticized  
Bradley -- his only challenger for the Democratic presidential 
nomination -- for considering a third-party presidential bid and for 
some of his votes during 18 years in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	In particular, Gore has cited Bradley's votes in favor of  
President Reagan's spending cuts in 1981 and against subsidies for 
ethanol. He also has criticized Bradley for leaving the Senate 
after Republicans took the majority in Congress.

<HEADLINE> Trade Center Bombers Resentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A federal judge slashed more than 100 years off  
the sentences of four Islamic militants convicted in the World 
Trade Center bombing, but they still must spend the rest of their 
lives behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
	In a resentencing hearing on Wednesday, U.S. District Judge  
Kevin Duffy ordered the men to serve a minimum of 108 years each 
behind bars, instead of the 240-year sentences they initially 
received. 
</P>
<P>
	A key plotter in the terrorist attack used the hearing to lash  
out against the United States. Mohammed Salameh said his six years 
behind bars has only hardened his view that the United States is a 
world bully that should keep its nose out of the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
	Duffy then took his turn. He said he found it ironic that  
Salameh criticized the United States, including its justice system, 
while glorifying Middle East nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you had been convicted of this crime under those foreign  
governments, there would be no resentencing,'' Duffy said. ``You 
don't resentence a dead person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the new sentences, Duffy ordered the defendants  
to each pay a $250,000 fine and $250 million in restitution to the 
victims should the story ever be bought for book or movie rights. 
The same fine and restitution was ordered for each defendant. 
</P>
<P>
	``The inside story of the bombing of the World Trade Center  
would create a fortune for its author,'' Duffy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Feb. 26, 1993, bombing killed six people and injured more  
than 1,000 others. Six people were convicted in the case, and all 
were sentenced to a life behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
	Duffy had to resentence four of the defendants after a federal  
appeals court ruled that 240-year sentences previously given were 
calculated incorrectly. 
</P>
<P>
	Salameh, 32, received 116 years and 11 months behind bars. He  
was followed by Nidal Ayyad, 32, a chemist Duffy said had studied 
in the United States, gotten a good job, married and become a 
father before ordering chemicals for the Trade Center bomb. 
</P>
<P>
	Ayyad claimed no Arab could get a fair trial in the United  
States after the bombing. Duffy disagreed, saying Ayyad ``took 
everything you could from this country'' and then tried to kill its 
people with terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
	He sentenced Ayyad to 117 years and a month in prison.  
</P>
<P>
	Mahmud Abouhalima, 39, declined to say anything. Duffy ordered  
him to spend 108 years and four months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The final defendant, Ahmad Ajaj, 34, told Duffy he was innocent.  
He was sentenced to 114 years and 10 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramzi Yousef, the alleged mastermind of the bombing who was  
captured in Pakistan in 1995, was later convicted in the United 
States. The sixth Trade Center defendant is Eyad Ismoil. Both are 
in jail.

<HEADLINE> President Honors Secret Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Opening the new Secret Service headquarters,  
President Clinton revealed some details Thursday about his 
interactions with the security detail the public never sees. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, there was the time a tactical team member nearly  
shot him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought: This would be a heck of a note for the Secret  
Service. `Clinton killed by agent protecting the president,''' 
Clinton quipped. 
</P>
<P>
	The audience, which included several agents as well as Treasury  
Secretary Lawrence Summers and National Security Adviser Sandy 
Berger, laughed heartily at the anecdote. But the event apparently 
was serious. 
</P>
<P>
	Early in his presidency, Clinton recalled, alarms sounded at the  
White House to warn that an intruder may have entered the executive 
compound. Secret Service agents went into action, but the new 
president was unfamiliar with their procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	Unbeknownst to Clinton, who was on the third floor and heading  
to the second-floor residence, the elevator was stopped and the 
heavily armed Counter Assault Team took position on the staircase. 
</P>
<P>
	``So they're all looking for somebody that's invading the White  
House. I come tromping down the staircase to the third floor, this 
guy comes rushing up on the second floor, I look up and there he is 
with his weapon pointed at me,'' Clinton said, chuckling. ``That 
poor -- I think he still has nightmares about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton alluded to rumors of his occasionally rocky relationship  
with agents over his desire to mingle with crowds. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've had to put up with me on so many different occasions,  
under such stress. You know, you wake up in the morning and you're 
worried about something else, and you take it out by being a little 
short,'' Clinton said. ``You're impatient because you're tired and 
you've got a headache. They have to put up with all of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Acknowledging he occasionally chafes under the restraints of  
presidential security, he said he wanted to salute the men and 
women of the Secret Service for their dedication. ``I came here to 
say thank you on behalf of Hillary and Chelsea and myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From long trips abroad to late nights at the White House, ``the  
agents are always there,'' Clinton said, ``and I often wonder how 
many children they have and how hard it must be for them to be 
awake while their children are sleeping, and sleeping while their 
children are awake.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Opens Ad Campaign for 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the first television ad of his 2000  
campaign, Vice President Al Gore led a rush of Democrats seeking to 
turn the defeat of a global test ban treaty into a potent political 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans argued that their vote was the right one. Analysts  
and political operatives suggested it would be hard for anyone to 
use the issue to build a public groundswell to sway an election 
still nearly 13 months off. 
</P>
<P>
	``This vote goes against the tide of history,'' Gore said in the  
new ad airing later this week in Iowa, New Hampshire and nationally 
on CNN, according to a script from his campaign. ``I believe in my 
heart this vote does not speak for the American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore has said he would resubmit the treaty banning all nuclear  
test explosions if he wins the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	His Democratic rival, Bill Bradley, had his own rapid-response  
message: ``I will ask the Senate to reconsider it after I am 
elected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The treaty is of strategic importance to the United States,''  
Bradley said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., told reporters the  
treaty rejection would definitely be an issue in next year's 
national elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Said House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo.: ``I think the  
Senate looked as partisan and extreme as the House has looked in 
past days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whether that translates into political fallout for Republicans  
remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
	It works as an issue ``just on the merits,'' suggested  
Democratic pollster Mark Mellman. ``You can't stick your thumb in 
the eye of 80 percent of the American people. They do support this 
treaty. People are against nuclear testing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters were fond of using that figure -- 80 percent -- during  
Senate debate. It comes from a poll that Mellman did with 
Republican pollster Richard Wirthlin last summer for a 
treaty-advocacy group. 
</P>
<P>
	Another pollster, Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research  
Center for the People &AMP; the Press, agreed that the treaty vote 
``could become a debatable issue'' in upcoming campaigns and one 
that would work against Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	``But that negativity could soften as Republicans get their case  
out. If Republicans can make the case that this treaty would 
endanger us, it would take some of the sting out of it,'' Kohut 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton set the tone for the campaign-style attacks,  
accusing Republicans Thursday of ``reckless partisanship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., disputed Clinton's  
interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the American people would like to know that those  
weapons here in America are safe, not dangerous, and also would 
like to know that as long as there's any chance we might need them 
that they would be reliable,'' Lott said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican presidential candidates George W. Bush, Elizabeth  
Dole, Gary Bauer and Steve Forbes have all opposed the 
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	``Republicans in Congress were right to reject,'' Forbes said in  
a statement. ``It was an agreement that would compromise our 
national security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Treaty opponents also included both Senate Republicans who are  
presidential hopefuls: John McCain of Arizona and Orrin Hatch of 
Utah; and independent presidential contender Sen. Bob Smith of New 
Hampshire, a former Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, who helped block efforts by moderate Republicans to put  
off a vote, said he wasn't surprised Democrats are trying to make 
the rejection a campaign issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, that's the way it is in politics,'' he said. He  
defended his position. ``It's better to be definitive than to 
delay,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stuart Rothenberg, an independent political analyst in  
Washington, said the issue may help Gore ``whip up the Democratic 
troops and energize his base.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But I'd be stunned if this is a major factor in 2000. If you  
ask people if they want a nuclear test ban, they all say sure,'' 
Rothenberg said. ``If and when Republicans have to defend 
themselves, I'm sure they can muddy the water up enough to do so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Clinton campaign consultant James Carville said the issue  
might help Democrats a bit but only to reinforce voters' views of 
the Republican majorities in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue, taken alone, ``won't cause a stampede to the polls,''  
Carville said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, who called the rejection an act of ``political  
spitefulness,'' said he worked past midnight during a West Coast 
trip to write and tape his ad hours after the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``I plan to make it an issue in the campaign,'' Gore told a  
group of moderate Democrats after returning to Washington on 
Thursday night.

<HEADLINE> Forest Service Explains Injuction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BENTON, Ill. (AP) -- A federal injunction that stopped certain  
logging projects in national forests has so far affected less than 
1 percent of the annual wood harvest from those forests, the 
government said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	But the ultimate impact of the injunction still remains unclear.  
The U.S. Forest Service has yet to calculate the amount of timber 
awaiting sale subject to the injunction, said spokesman Pete 
Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
	The injunction filed Sept. 28 affects timber sales under what is  
known as a ``categorical exclusion.'' The exclusion is used by the 
Forest Service to allow timber companies to log up to 250,000 
board-feet of live timber or up to 1 million board-feet of dead 
timber without the agency first completing various environmental 
impact assessments. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists had argued the Forest Service was using the  
program to skirt costly and time-consuming environmental reviews. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Forest Service, work has stopped on 141  
projects because of the injunction. Those projects stand to produce 
about 26 million board feet of timber, or enough to build about 
1,733 homes. 
</P>
<P>
	About 3.3 billion board feet of timber are harvested from  
national forests each year -- enough to build about 220,000 houses, 
according to the Forest Service.

<HEADLINE> Unsolved JonBenet Case Is Not Alone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- A young girl beaten to death, an intensive  
investigation, a grand jury and a killer on the loose years later. 
</P>
<P>
	Sounds like the JonBenet Ramsey case, but it is also the case of  
Dimetria Smith, taken to a Georgia hospital a couple weeks short of 
her third birthday in 1991, suffering from a fatal blow to the 
head. More than eight years later, her killer has not been brought 
to justice, despite two grand juries that both brought indictments. 
</P>
<P>
	While the pressure to solve JonBenet's slaying has been intense  
from the outset, dozens of child homicides remain unsolved across 
the nation, out of the media spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
	Danny Craig, the district attorney in Georgia's Augusta Judicial  
Circuit, said grand juries brought indictments against both the 
girl's maternal grandfather and grandmother, but there isn't enough 
evidence to determine which may have committed the crime. It may 
never go to trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't ask jurors to take a leap of faith and find someone  
guilty when we ourselves are not convinced of their guilt beyond a 
reasonable doubt,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, 66 percent of all U.S. homicides were considered  
cleared by arrest or other circumstances, according to the FBI, 
which could not provide the same statistics for child homicides. At 
least one-third either were unsolved or suspects were not brought 
to trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Child-homicide experts believe justice is served in a much  
smaller percentage of child killings, but only if probable murders 
that are ruled unexplained deaths for lack of evidence are counted. 
</P>
<P>
	Rob Parrish, chief child-abuse counsel for the Utah attorney  
general's office, said one barrier to bringing a child's killer to 
justice is a widespread belief that a parent or guardian cannot be 
the murderer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more mainstream the family or the alleged or suspected  
perpetrator appears, the more difficult it is for decision-makers 
to believe that they were involved,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig, who took over as Augusta district attorney after  
Dimetria's death, called the lack of certainty in the case ``very 
unusual, very frustrating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If JonBenet had not been a beauty-pageant contestant who was  
killed at Christmastime, her slaying might have gone as unnoticed 
as that of Dimetria, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This case would be like several hundred others across the  
United States, where a tragedy escapes the notice of the public and 
cannot serve as a deterrent to crime,'' Craig said.

<HEADLINE> Source Says Starr Will Step Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With his five-year, $47 million investigation  
of the Clintons winding down, Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr 
will formally step aside next week and be replaced by one of his 
assistants, Robert Ray, sources familiar with Starr's plans said 
Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray, a federal prosecutor who joined Starr's office early this  
year, was selected by a panel of three federal appeals court judges 
to succeed the controversial special prosecutor, the sources told 
The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The judges, who interviewed several of Starr's deputies, have  
not issued a formal order yet, but they told the prosecutor's 
office of their plans this week, the sources said, speaking on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	That cleared the way for Starr, who has hinted for months his  
desire to step down, to return to private law practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's office declined to comment Thursday night.  
</P>
<P>
	Ray will try to wrap up an investigation that has ranged from  
allegedly fraudulent land deals in Arkansas to impeachment charges 
of presidential perjury and obstruction of justice in the Monica 
Lewinsky scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC News first reported the selection of Ray, who came to  
Starr's office after working for Independent Counsel Donald Smaltz. 
Smaltz's office unsuccessfully prosecuted former Agriculture 
Secretary Mike Espy but won a number of convictions against 
companies and individuals who had provided gifts to the agriculture 
secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's office has two pending investigative matters:  
</P>
<P>
	--An alleged attempt to influence the testimony of presidential  
accuser Kathleen Willey. 
</P>
<P>
	--Possible false statements regarding Hillary Rodham Clinton's  
role in the purge of White House travel office employees. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Starr's successor must produce a final report on  
the Whitewater scandal -- a document that could prove to be a 
political headache for Mrs. Clinton if she follows through on plans 
to run next year for a U.S. Senate seat from New York. 
</P>
<P>
	During Starr's tenure, his office convicted 14 people, including  
the Clintons' Whitewater business partners, Jim and Susan McDougal, 
and then-Arkansas Gov. Jim Guy Tucker, who resigned his office. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's investigation of the Lewinsky scandal -- the president's  
affair and subsequent cover-up -- led to the first presidential 
impeachment since 1868. 
</P>
<P>
	But Starr's long tenure was marred by questions over whether he  
conducted his investigation properly. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr subpoenaed the first lady in front of a federal grand  
jury. The president's supporters depicted Starr as a right-wing 
zealot who abused his prosecutorial powers. 
</P>
<P>
	Susan McDougal said Starr's investigators tried to get her to  
tell lies that falsely implicated the Clintons in wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's lawyer accused Starr's office of leaking grand jury  
material to the news media. Complaints about the conduct of Starr's 
prosecutors in the Lewinsky investigation poured into the Justice 
Department from Democrats on Capitol Hill as impeachment loomed. 
</P>
<P>
	The constant attacks took their toll. Public opposition to Starr  
soared. The prosecutor said the campaign against him infected the 
judicial process, leading to deadlocked juries that refused to 
convict. Starr gave up on prosecuting Susan McDougal, whose 
cooperation he never was able to get. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's impeachment by the House in the Lewinsky scandal was  
followed by acquittal in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Late in his investigation, Starr drew additional criticism in  
bringing two indictments against Mrs. Clinton's former law partner, 
Webster Hubbell, who had already served a prison term on a guilty 
plea to stealing $400,000 from his law firm and its clients. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr said Hubbell had given incomplete testimony about his and  
the first lady's legal work on one of her Whitewater partner's 
fraudulent real estate projects. Hubbell steadfastly denied knowing 
of any wrongdoing by Mrs. Clinton. He settled the cases by pleading 
guilty to a felony in exchange for no jail time.

<HEADLINE> Biologist Uses DNA To Track Bears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (AP) -- Biologist Don White Jr. collects bear  
hair from the outdoors the way a good detective collects samples at 
a crime scene, carefully scrutinizing the DNA of each follicle. 
</P>
<P>
	He's not trying to bust Yogi for stealing picnic baskets,  
though. White is using DNA ``fingerprinting'' to track population 
shifts of bears in the Ozarks and other wilderness areas. 
</P>
<P>
	He hopes the technique will eliminate the sometimes dangerous  
method of drugging and tagging wildlife in order to track them. 
</P>
<P>
	``DNA tracking is a faster and more economical way to determine  
the sex of the bears, and say with a high degree of confidence 
whether the animals are increasing, decreasing or staying the same 
in a particular area,'' White, an assistant professor of Biology at 
Dury College in Springfield, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	To collect the hair, White uses commercial skunk spray to lure  
the bears to a particular area. Once there, they have to crawl 
under or step over barbed wire, which captures the hair. 
</P>
<P>
	The DNA is extracted from the follicle's dermal papilla, or the  
``pulpy'' end of the strand. 
</P>
<P>
	``The mental reasoning behind this comes from forensic science,  
which has been using these techniques for the last 10 years,'' 
White said. ``I guess you could say I watched the O.J. Simpson 
trial very closely ... my research is a very practical extension of 
the collection done at a crime scene.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White, 38, began monitoring grizzlies in 1991 in Montana's  
Glacier National Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Not satisfied with the trapping and tagging techniques used to  
track most wildlife, White began collecting hair samples at Glacier 
about a year ago and now has a team of scientists who help collect 
and analyze samples. 
</P>
<P>
	White has turned his research to the Ozarks of southern  
Missouri, where the black bear population once thrived. 
</P>
<P>
	Black bears were nearly wiped out at the turn of the century  
when forests were cleared to make way for farmland, White said. But 
between 1958 and 1967, the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission 
successfully reintroduced the black bear to the western Ozarks.

<HEADLINE> Tyco Stock Plunges 6 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EXETER, N.H. (AP) -- Shares in Tyco International Ltd. fell an  
additional 9.4 percent in heavy trading Thursday even as the 
company denied it had engaged in questionable accounting practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Criticisms from a single investment manager sparked rumors on  
Wall Street, sending Tyco's stuck tumbling more than 6 percent on 
Wednesday. The slide continued Thursday, when its price fell $9 to 
close at $87 a share as the most active issue on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 30 million shares changed hands Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	David Tice, a Dallas fund manager and prominent short-seller,  
recently criticized Tyco's accounting practices during its $30 
billion acquisition spree over the last three years, the New York 
Times reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Tice said Tyco disguised a decline in cash flow by delaying some  
payments and taking overly large charges to make future earnings 
look higher. He stopping short of accusing the company of illegal 
accounting practices, but said it was trying to make itself look 
better. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyco, a manufacturing and service conglomerate based in Bermuda  
but managed from Exeter, called the rumors ``unfounded and 
malicious'' in a statement released Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyco chairman and chief executive Dennis Kozlowski said the  
company would ask federal and exchange regulators to investigate 
the source of the rumors and take appropriate action. 
</P>
<P>
	Kozlowski also said Tyco's earnings for the next quarter, set to  
be released Oct. 21, would exceed analysts' expectations of 89 
cents a share.

	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- With hundreds of rocket scientists  
and launch pad workers cheering from the sidelines, historic Launch 
Complex 41 was blasted to pieces today with 180 pounds of 
explosives. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd joined in the countdown preceding the demolition.  
</P>
<P>
	``Five-4-3-2-1! Blasting into the future!'' shouted Adrian  
Laffitte, a launch manager for rocket maker Lockheed Martin Corp., 
which wanted the pad flattened to make way for more modern launch 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	As he shouted his words, the detonation button was pushed and  
the explosives were ignited. A few seconds passed before booms, 
flashes of flames and billowing gray smoke erupted at the bases of 
two launch towers. Within seconds, the towers, 200 and 300 feet 
high respectively, crumpled to the ground, a heap of 7 million 
pounds of steel to be recycled. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wow!'' one man in the crowd shouted. ``Awesome!'' shouted  
another.

<HEADLINE> Medicare Reform Unlikely This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers have narrowed Medicare negotiations  
to proposals that would give $15 billion to health care providers 
who have dogged Congress with complaints their fees were squeezed 
too tight. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional leaders say agreement is out of reach on a major  
overhaul of the health insurance program for the elderly and 
disabled, including the addition of new prescription drug benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we have enough time to do it this year,'' Senate  
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Separate plans offered by House and Senate committee chairmen  
this week would give nursing homes more money for patients with 
complex illnesses, loosen payment caps for rehabilitative therapy, 
and grant hospitals, HMOs and home health care companies a 
temporary reprieve from scheduled fee cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Both plans would dip into budget surpluses expected in coming  
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The House plan would offer relief to caregivers more quickly --  
$15 billion over five years compared with the Senate's $15.2 
billion over a decade -- and the two plans would disburse the relief 
differently. 
</P>
<P>
	Reception from health care industry groups has been lukewarm.  
</P>
<P>
	``We view this as a down payment,'' said American Hospital  
Association spokeswoman Carol Schadelbauer. 
</P>
<P>
	The prospects are good for an eventual compromise among  
lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, an influential senior  
Democrat, has endorsed the Senate plan by Sen. William Roth, 
R-Del., the Senate Finance Committee chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton administration officials reviewing both GOP proposals  
were optimistic they could form the basis of some small bipartisan 
agreement on Medicare this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president, the vice president and the first lady have  
stated their strong belief that some of the Medicare provider cuts 
were flawed and resulted in excessive payment reductions,'' White 
House domestic policy adviser Chris Jennings said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton is seeking to broaden the potential agreement  
by trying to persuade Republicans to offset the relief payments 
with some new changes in the way Medicare does business, such as 
requiring competitive bidding by medical suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
	But White House expectations are low that any Medicare deal  
could go beyond that this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, lawmakers had touted $115 billion in Medicare payment  
cuts that were part of the balanced budget act as a move toward 
more accurate reimbursement of health care providers they said had 
long been overpaid. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, as the government is expecting bigger and bigger budget  
surpluses into the future, many health care companies are 
struggling. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial analysts say a variety of forces in addition to the  
Medicare cuts are creating turmoil in the medical marketplace, 
including the shift to managed care and too-rapid expansions by 
some companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Nursing homes have blamed Medicare for recent layoffs,  
plummeting stock prices and the bankruptcy of one large national 
chain. 
</P>
<P>
	Hospitals reporting financial losses and falling bond ratings  
are saying in their own $3 million public relations campaign: ``Is 
this what Congress meant to happen when it balanced the nation's 
budget?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials have been among the most skeptical  
about the industry complaints. Health and Human Services Secretary 
Donna Shalala has said she believes that most companies are now 
paid fairly by Medicare and that they got in financial trouble only 
because they had gotten used to being paid too much. 
</P>
<P>
	But earlier this year, Clinton offered to return $7.5 billion to  
caregivers to prevent any harm to Medicare patients.

<HEADLINE> Northwest Jet Loses Tire on Takeoff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A tire that fell off a Northwest Airlines jet as  
it took off from Midway Airport on Thursday went through a fence 
and struck a car, injuring a pregnant woman. 
</P>
<P>
	Nadia Brandon, 23, was taken to a hospital, where doctors said  
they planned to keep her for observation for several hours although 
she was not seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard a plane fly over and next thing I know, a big tire  
came through the wall and hit the passenger side of my car,'' she 
told WBBM-AM radio station. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the left rear tires fell off as Northwest Flight 1412, a  
McDonnell Douglas DC-9, took off from Midway en route to Detroit, 
said Monique Bond, a spokeswoman for the Chicago Department of 
Aviation. The plane carrying 98 passengers and a crew of six 
continued to Detroit, where it landed safely. 
</P>
<P>
	``At no time were the passengers, the crew or the aircraft in  
any jeopardy,'' said Bill Wade, Northwest's vice president of line 
maintenance operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The captain informed the passengers about 30 minutes into the  
flight about what had happened. Flight attendants briefed the 
passengers just before the plane arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	``They told us exactly what was going to happen when we went to  
land,'' passenger Rick Barke told Detroit television station WDIV. 
``I think him (the captain) being calm and the flight attendants 
being calm helped to keep everybody else in order on the plane.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were at least two fire trucks and one ambulance standing  
by, said Northwest spokesman Bob Ball. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane went into a holding pattern and dumped fuel to become  
lighter before landing. 
</P>
<P>
	Ball said the plane will be turned over to the Federal Aviation  
Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board for 
investigation.

<HEADLINE> Bond Yields Hit Two-Year High / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices fell for a third consecutive  
session, as interest rate jitters pushed yields on benchmark 
30-year Treasurys to a two-year high. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 5/8 point, or $6.25  
per $1,000 in face value, for a second straight session. Its yield, 
which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.32 percent, the 
highest for 30-year Treasurys since hitting 6.42 percent on Oct. 
22, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders continue to fret over the growing strength of the U.S.  
economy. Twice already this year, Federal Reserve policy-makers 
have increased interest rates to rein in economic expansion. An 
overheated economy can lead to inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed, which meets again on Nov. 16., held interest rates  
steady last week, but left open the possibility of another rate 
increase if inflation resurfaces. 
</P>
<P>
	Economic data released Thursday did nothing to ease traders'  
concerns. The Commerce Department reported that September retail 
sales was lower than most economists had predicted, climbing 0.1 
percent instead of the anticipated 0.2 percent. But August sales 
were revised upward to 1.5 percent from 1.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, some analysts believe third-quarter gross domestic  
product growth could be far greater than economists had expected. 
Third-quarter GDP estimates will be released Oct. 28. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, a Labor Department report showed that prices of  
imported goods continued to climb last month, as overall import 
prices jumped 0.7 percent. And prices of imported consumer goods 
climbed 0.3 percent, the largest rise in nearly four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond investors should have a better sense of what direction the  
Fed is headed after the release Friday of the producer price index, 
a key inflationary gauge. The consumer price index is due for 
release on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices of short-term Treasury securities were down 3/32 point to  
5/32 point while intermediate maturities fell 1/4 point to 7/16 
point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 5.01 percent as the  
discount rose 0.04 percentage point from Tuesday's auction to 4.88 
percent. Six-month yields were 5.15 percent, as the discount rose 
0.01 percentage point to 4.95 percent. One-year yields were 5.43 
percent as the discount rose 0.03 percentage point from late 
Wednesday to 5.14 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate rose to 5.25 percent from 5.19 percent  
late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell to 109 19/32 from 110 5/16 late 
Wednesday. The average yield to maturity rose to 6.06 percent from 
6.01 percent on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Editors Seek Diversity, Credibility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- Improving credibility with readers and  
diversifying news staffs are key to the future success of 
newspapers, participants at the annual Associated Press Managing 
Editors conference were told. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent surveys of readers have found fewer trust newspapers to  
report the news accurately and without bias. Getting feedback from 
readers about why they feel that way, coming up with ways to 
address their concerns and then implementing them will help, a 
panel of experts said Thursday . 
</P>
<P>
	``A newspaper cannot be credible unless it is seen as fair in  
the minds of readers,'' said Robert H. Giles, senior vice president 
of The Freedom Forum, an international foundation dedicated to 
press freedom and free speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Christine Urban, president of the consulting firm of Urban &AMP;  
Associates, discussed results of a 1998 nationwide survey of 
journalists and readers conducted for the American Society of 
Newspaper Editors' Journalism Credibility Project. It found a lack 
of connection between journalists and readers, with journalists 
generally saying the public doesn't understand their work and 
readers saying journalists don't share their values and don't do 
enough to ensure accurate reporting. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the major findings: readers find too many factual and  
grammatical errors in stories; the public perceives sensational 
stories are over-covered to sell papers; and readers don't believe 
newspapers understand and respect the communities they cover. 
</P>
<P>
	Judy Christie, chairwoman of ASNE's Ethics and Values Committee,  
suggested individual newspapers identify an area of coverage that 
receives complaints, analyze why readers are upset and then try to 
involve readers in fixing the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Currie, vice president of news for Gannett Corp., noted his  
company has come up with rules for ethical conduct at its 73 
papers. At the heart of them is a commitment to ``seeking and 
reporting the truth in a truthful way,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	APME President Pam Johnson, executive editor of The Arizona  
Republic, said a failure to reflect the diversity of their 
communities hurts newspapers' credibility. She applauded this 
year's first National Time-Out for Diversity and Accuracy, in which 
staffs at nearly 200 newspapers and every Associated Press bureau 
discussed the value of diversity in news coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's that circle of discussion followed by action that is so  
key to making progress,'' she said. ``And if we can keep that 
circle going, we can provide a more accurate portrayal of our 
communities and build newsrooms that provide a promising 
environment to attract and keep minorities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A panel discussion moderated by AP President Louis D. Boccardi  
focused on coverage of the civil rights movement and how racial 
issues are reported today. The consensus was the media was key to 
the success of the civil rights movement but now devotes too little 
attention to racial problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Nelson, the chief Washington correspondent for the Los  
Angeles Times who covered the civil rights movement, said in many 
ways ``that was the news media's finest hour.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think today we're not doing a very good job,'' he said,  
citing failures to report extensively on issues such as housing 
bias and employment discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	Frances Murphy, publisher of the Washington (D.C.) AFRO-American  
newspaper, said most daily papers do not adequately cover issues 
important to blacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Community newspapers are growing and the reason is you're not  
covering your communities,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	APME writing awards for the Associated Press staff were handed  
out at a luncheon: 
</P>
<P>
	-- The AP Denver bureau won an award for excellence in deadline  
coverage for the Columbine High School shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Rex Huppke of the Indianapolis bureau won the John L.  
Dougherty Award, which recognizes an outstanding reporter with less 
than three years' service with the AP. 
</P>
<P>
	-- AP national writer Todd Lewan won the feature writing and  
enterprise reporting categories. The feature award was for a serial 
account of the dramatic rescue attempt of a fishing crew in the 
Gulf of Alaska. The enterprise reporting award was for an in-depth 
look at the tobacco industry's creation of a more addictive 
tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Best news photography awards went to nine photographers for a  
package of photos on Kosovo. They are Peter Dejong, Jerome Delay, 
Eric Draper, John Gaps III, David Guttenfelder, Srdjan Ilic, 
Santiago Lyon, Enric Marti and Dimitri Messinis. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Brennan Linsley won the best feature photo award for a series  
of photos on famine in Sudan.

<HEADLINE> Former Nixon Adviser Dies of Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) -- George L. Grassmuck, professor emeritus  
at the University of Michigan and a special assistant in the Nixon 
administration, has died. He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Grassmuck died Sunday of prostate cancer.  
</P>
<P>
	He was the University of Michigan's assistant vice president for  
academic affairs in the 1960s and acting director of the Center for 
Near Eastern and North African Studies. He was a founding member of 
the national Middle East Studies Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The World War II veteran was born in Nebraska City, Neb., and  
earned political science degrees from the University of California 
at Los Angeles in the early 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
	He earned a doctorate in 1949 from Johns Hopkins University,  
where he remained to teach for three years. He also taught at 
Boston University, UCLA and the American University of Beirut 
before joining Michigan. He taught there from 1957 until his 
retirement in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1960, he took a leave from Michigan to serve as chief of  
research of Richard Nixon's presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, he was appointed special assistant of international  
affairs for the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, and he 
served as deputy to Presidential Counselor Robert Finch from 1970 
to 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	Grassmuck also served as consultant to the international  
division of the Ford Foundation, the North Central Association of 
Colleges and Secondary Schools and the U.S. Office of Education in 
the 1960s and 1970s. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> 10 Percent of U.S. Households Hungry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nearly 10 percent of U.S. households are going  
hungry or don't have consistent access to adequate food, the 
Agriculture Department said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In New Mexico, 15.1 percent of households were either hungry or  
threatened with hunger from 1996 to 1998, according to a USDA 
study. 
</P>
<P>
	Mississippi, Texas, Arizona, Louisiana, Arkansas and Oregon had  
rates of 12.6 percent or higher. Overall, hunger hit at least 10 
percent of the households in 18 states, USDA said. 
</P>
<P>
	``During this, the most prosperous economy in decades, it should  
shock most Americans to learn that hunger persists and it is in 
every state,'' Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said. ``The 
problem of hunger amid America's plenty cannot and will not be 
ignored.'' 
</P>
<P>
	North Dakota had by far the smallest share of households that  
are short of food at 4.6 percent. Four other states -- 
Massachusetts, South Dakota, Delaware and Minnesota -- had rates 
below 7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, 9.7 percent of households were considered ``food  
insecure'' during the three-year period, according to USDA, which 
based its conclusions on annual household surveys conducted by the 
U.S. Census Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	The study's results generally tracked poverty rates, but there  
were a few states, including Washington, Oregon and New Hampshire, 
where the incidence of hunger was higher. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA officials said it was possible for a family to be living  
above the poverty line and still go through periods during the year 
when they were short of food. Local costs of living have an impact 
on hunger, they said, as well as family support and the 
availability of community nutrition programs. 
</P>
<P>
	There also were states with high hunger rates where use of food  
stamps was relatively low. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, participation in food stamp program has fallen by 27  
percent since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	While the drop is due largely to the strong economy and changes  
in eligibility requirements, demand has grown for food aid from 
other programs and nonprofit organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	Glickman was releasing the study Thursday in Chicago at a  
national conference of food-assistance groups.

<HEADLINE> Pirates Lose Wright on Waivers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Ron Wright, once considered the Pittsburgh  
Pirates' heir apparent at first base, was claimed off waivers by 
the Cincinnati Reds as the Pirates made several roster moves 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dropped from the 40-man roster and assigned outright to Triple-A  
Nashville were right-hander Jason Phillips, who made the team 
coming out of spring training; catcher Tim Laker; left-hander Jeff 
Tabaka; and utilityman John Wehner. 
</P>
<P>
	The moves left 19 pitchers, three catchers, six infielders and  
eight outfielders on the roster. On the 60-day disabled list are 
catcher Jason Kendall, pitchers Rich Loiselle and Javier Martinez, 
and infielders Ivan Cruz, Ed Sprague and Doug Strange. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright once was considered the key player in the four-man trade  
that sent former 20-game winner Denny Neagle to Atlanta in August 
1996, but his Pirates minor-league career was interrupted 
frequently by back problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The 23-year-old Wright hit 32 homers in the minors in 1995 and  
36 in 1996, but was limited to 20 games in 1998 before needing 
surgery to repair a herniated disk and to 24 games this season. 
</P>
<P>
	In minimal playing time at Double-A Altoona, he hit .213 with no  
homers and four RBIs. With first baseman Kevin Young going into the 
first year of a $24 million, four-year contract in 2000, the 
Pirates apparently felt Wright was expendable. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprague, who broke his left hand in September and missed the  
final three weeks of the season, was playing under a one-year 
contract and is not expected back. 
</P>
<P>
	Strange did not play for the Pirates this season because of an  
elbow injury and also is not expected to return. He signed a $1 
million, two-year contract before the 1998 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Tabaka, a left-handed reliever, missed the season following  
elbow surgery. Wehner was out of baseball when the Pirates offered 
him a minor-league job at midseason, but hit only .185 in 30 games 
after being called up by Pittsburgh.

<HEADLINE> Dead Ill. Child's Mom Said Known </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	POPLAR GROVE, Ill. (AP) -- In 1996, a newborn baby was found dead  
on a back porch in the near-freezing cold. The people of this 
little farming town gave the unidentified child a name -- Angelica 
Faith -- and a proper burial. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, more than three years later, investigators say the child's  
mother was the girl next door -- and her unknowing parents were 
among those who helped bury the baby. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say Kelli Moye, now 19, had carried the secret until  
her parents found out last weekend and made an agonizing call to 
police. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was their granddaughter,'' Master Sgt. Phil Beu of the  
Boone County Sheriff's department said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Moye, looking tired and emotionless, was arrested Monday on  
a charge of first-degree murder at her parents' home in Poplar 
Grove, a town of 750 people 70 miles northwest of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators say she told them how, as a petite high school  
freshman, she wore baggy clothes to hide her pregnancy and gave 
birth to the 7-pound baby in February 1996 in her upstairs bedroom 
while her parents slept below. 
</P>
<P>
	Beu said Ms. Moye then bathed the baby, dressed her in pajamas,  
wrapped her in a towel and left her on the back steps of the house 
next door with part of her umbilical cord still attached. 
Investigators believe the baby then died of exposure. 
</P>
<P>
	A few days later, Ms. Moye attended the funeral with her parents  
at a church a few blocks from their house. But she said nothing -- 
not to friends, teachers, her parents or even police, who 
questioned her and several other people who lived and worked on the 
street of modest two-story homes, a corner grocery, a bank and 
several feed elevators. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Moye would later tell investigators that only the baby's  
alleged father, Michael Mirshak, knew what she had done. But he, 
too, said nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	Months passed, then years, with investigators making little  
progress. DNA tests cleared one suspect -- the girlfriend of a man 
who had lived in the house where the baby was left. Other tips 
trickled in -- a sighting of a teen-age couple with a baby near the 
house -- but nothing panned out. 
</P>
<P>
	The phone call from Ms. Moye's parents came on Sunday, after a  
fight earlier that day between Ms. Moye and Mirshak, who had been 
sharing an apartment just outside Rockford. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Ms. Moye's account, Mirshak struck her in the face  
and head. When she threatened to call police, he said he would tell 
them about the baby. She decided to keep quiet but took refuge at 
the home of her parents, who asked about bruises on her face, Beu 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think from that point, everything just escalated and took  
off from there,'' Beu said. Ms. Moye told her parents about the 
fight, and then the baby, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mirshak, 20, was arrested Tuesday on a domestic battery charge.  
Beu said investigators are trying to determine if he was involved 
in the baby's death, though Ms. Moye has supposedly told police he 
wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
	Mirshak, who was released on $5,000 bail, has had his phone  
disconnected and could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Moye was jailed on $500,000 bail and could get up to life in  
prison. Her parents' number is unlisted, and they did not reply to 
a written message left at their home. 
</P>
<P>
	Her public defender, Azhar Minhas, said Ms. Moye would plead  
innocent. He declined to discuss the specifics of the case but said 
it's too early to determine whether his client truly confessed. 
</P>
<P>
	Some in the community say they understand how a 15-year-old  
might be afraid to tell her parents about a pregnancy, but they are 
frustrated that the baby's parents' apparently never sought help. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a tragedy. We had so many people who said, `We wish  
we could have taken the baby and adopted her,''' said Virginia 
Dimond, a pastoral assistant at Poplar Grove United Methodist 
Church, where the funeral was held. ``So many people would've 
gladly helped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But even if Ms. Moye's story is true -- DNA tests are being done  
to confirm the parents' identities -- some say they will always 
wonder what could have possessed someone to leave a baby to die on 
that cold day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure we'll ever know,'' said Tina Gamlin, who donated  
the baby's headstone. ``I think she doesn't even know why.''

<HEADLINE> Indians Pitching Coach Regan Retires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Phil Regan retired as the Indians pitching  
coach Thursday, three days after Cleveland's collapse in the first 
round of the AL playoffs against the Boston Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	The 62-year-old Regan was in his second stint with the Indians  
after serving as pitching coach in 1994. He left Cleveland 
following that season to manage the Baltimore Orioles in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland held a club option for 2000 on Regan, but declined to  
pick it up by Oct. 1. Indians media relations director Bart Swain 
said he did not know if Regan would pursue another job in the 
majors. 
</P>
<P>
	Regan was hired last October after the Indians reassigned  
pitching coach Mark Wiley, who spent this past season with the 
Kansas City Royals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians hoped Regan would quicken the development of  
youngsters Bartolo Colon and Jaret Wright. 
</P>
<P>
	Colon had an outstanding season, posting an 18-5 mark with a  
3.95 ERA. Wright, however, went 8-10 with a 6.06 ERA and pitched in 
relief against the Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	His year also included two stints on the disabled list and a  
controversial meeting with AL president Gene Budig amid accusations 
he was throwing at hitters. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland's pitching fell apart against Boston as the Red Sox  
scored 44 runs in the final three games to overcome an 0-2 deficit 
and advance to the ALCS against the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians' pitching staff was ravaged by injuries all year,  
with Wright, Steve Karsay, Steve Reed, Ricardo Rincon and Paul 
Shuey among the pitchers who spent time on the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	Regan's departure could be the first of several for the Indians  
this winter. Cleveland general manager John Hart said earlier this 
week that the club would be examining ways to improve, and would be 
reviewing manager Mike Hargrove's status. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove has drawn harsh criticism for some of his decisions  
during the Red Sox series. Hargrove, who has managed the Indians 
for nine seasons, is signed for 2000 with a club option for 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have had no discussions about the manager,'' Hart said.  
``No decision has been made. We're going to need time.''

<HEADLINE> Polaroid Earnings Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- Polaroid Co. posted third-quarter  
operating profits Thursday of $22 million, or 50 cents a share. But 
the company's stock slumped after a warning that fourth-quarter 
earnings might be lower than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The results compare to earnings of $18 million or 40 cents per  
share in the year-ago period, which exclude a pre-tax gain on the 
sale of real estate of $19 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The results met the expectations of analysts surveyed by First  
Call/Thomson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	Accounting for a previously reported $40 million charge relating  
to a graphics venture, Polaroid would have lost $3.8 million, or 9 
cents a share in the quarter ended Sept. 26. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for the quarter, led by a 35 percent gain in Asia, grew 3  
percent, from $448.8 million to $463 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're making clear progress with our new products strategy,''  
said Gary Mello, chairman and chief executive officer, citing the 
popularity of the new I-Zone Instant Pocket Camera and the JoyCam. 
``I'm pleased with our second consecutive quarter-versus-quarter 
revenue gain and the significantly improved operating profit, 
excluding the graphics charge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But shares of Polaroid fell nearly 13 percent, or $3.18 3/4, to  
close at $22.18 3/4, after the company said fourth-quarter earnings 
would not meet expectations, primarily because it planned to invest 
heavily in an advertising campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was kind of a heads up that we're going to be spending  
more in the fourth quarter,'' said company spokeswoman Nancy 
Childs. ``That means our bottom line will be a little lower in the 
fourth quarter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Childs said Polaroid wanted to advertise to make sure launches  
of new products went successfully, and also to attract a new 
generation of younger customers. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of the year, Polaroid's sales were  
$1.33 billion, up slightly from $1.3 billion in the first nine 
months of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding one-time items, earnings for the first nine months of  
1999 were $86 million, compared with $33 million for the same 
period in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Commission Traces Nazi Loot in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Much of a trainload of Nazi loot captured by  
U.S. forces in Austria after World War II ended up in the homes of 
U.S. generals or being sold in sold in the Army Exchange or at 
auction, a U.S. presidential commission concluded today. A suitcase 
of gold simply disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the goods believed to have been confiscated from  
Hungarian Jews by Nazi forces, including 1,100 paintings and a 
suitcase full of gold dust, was properly returned to Hungary as 
they should have been under international law and U.S. policy, said 
the Presidential Commission on Holocaust Assets. 
</P>
<P>
	The paintings and some other items were transferred to the  
Austrian government, which told U.S. investigators ``a portion of 
this property has been restituted,'' according to a report on what 
is called the Hungarian Gold Train by the commission staff. But it 
said ultimate disposition of none of the paintings is known and the 
suitcase of gold disappeared from a U.S. military warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
	The train carrying the property was seized by U.S. infantry on  
May 16, 1945 -- nine days after the Allied victory in Europe -- in 
Werfen, Austria, 60 miles south of Salzburg. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission said it would interview surviving members of U.S.  
forces in Austria, search individual claims of Hungarian victims of 
the Holocaust and try to gain a clearer picture of how decisions 
were made on handling items from the train. 
</P>
<P>
	Sold in the Army Exchange in Europe were less valuable items  
such as watches, cameras and modest jewelry, it said. An auction 
was later held in New York for some of the items, over the protests 
of Hungarian Jews. 
</P>
<P>
	A commission release called it ``an example of an egregious  
failure of the United States to follow its own policy regarding 
restitution of Holocaust victims' property after World War II.'' It 
said the decision not to return property to Hungary, despite 
appeals from Hungarian Jews, was based on the conclusion by Gen. 
Mark Clark that its origin could not be determined. This was later 
affirmed by Secretary of State George Marshall, the commission 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission stressed that U.S. forces ``generally behaved in  
a commendable way,'' but said the handling of the Gold Train was a 
notable exception. 
</P>
<P>
	The report and the commission's conclusions were being presented  
at a commission meeting this afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Sauter Wins Pole at Craftsman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Jay Sauter has a mathematical chance,  
at best, to capture the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series championship 
but his late season surge could have a big impact on who does win 
the title race. 
</P>
<P>
	Sauter, who scored his first victory of the year a week ago in  
Louisville, Ky., captured his second consecutive pole position 
Thursday at Texas Motor Speedway, narrowly missing the track record 
he established when the tour visited the 1.5-mile speedway in June. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wisconsin driver, who drives a Chevrolet for Richard  
Childress Racing, will line up at the head of Friday's 36-truck 
field following his lap of 179.152 mph. Sauter hopes to build on 
his domination in the June race, in which he led 31 laps and 
charged back from a mid-race accident to finish second. 
</P>
<P>
	Sauter, who stands sixth in the driver standings entering the  
season's penultimate race, was joined on the front row by Dennis 
Setzer, third in the points and winner of the June race. Setzer's 
lap was 178.318 in a Dodge. 
</P>
<P>
	Setzer is one of three championship contenders separated by 44  
points. Leader Jack Sprague, who wrecked his primary truck in 
practice, settled for 19th on the grid, and Greg Biffle, a 
nine-time winner in 1999, qualified 13th. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our whole game plan is to win, not race for points,'' said  
Sauter, who's moving to the NASCAR Busch Series next year. ``The 
(crew) gave me an awesome truck. We were shooting for 180. We 
didn't quite make it but how can you be disappointed when you win 
two poles in a row here?'' 
</P>
<P>
	He'll have to beat Setzer who also isn't counting points.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have the same truck, the same setup and the same program we  
did in the spring so we are looking forward to good things tomorrow 
night,'' said Setzer, who paced a record nine Dodge trucks 
qualifying for the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprague, meanwhile, will have to rebound if he hopes to protect  
a 24-point lead, closest in series history with two races to go. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ran just about what I thought we would,'' he said. ``The  
Hendrick (crew) did a great job in a short time taking the good 
motor out of the primary truck and sticking it in the backup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Second-year driver Andy Houston, seventh here in June, took the  
No. 3 starting position in a Chevrolet at 178.183. Joining Houston 
on row two will be defending series champion Ron Hornaday, who went 
178.000 in a Chevy. 
</P>
<P>
	Five drivers on the 41-truck entry list failed to make the  
field, including Ross Thompson, who was unable to make a qualifying 
attempt following a practice accident in Turn 4. Thompson was 
uninjured. 
</P>
<P>
	Boris Said, who qualified 28th, was involved in a  
post-qualifying practice crash but was unhurt. His team may be 
forced to start a backup truck in Friday's 125-lap, 187.5-mile 
race.

<HEADLINE> Disputes Arise Over Charter Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Parents in one Baton Rouge, La., neighborhood  
were relieved when they first learned of the opening of a charter 
school. But they became disheartened to learn the school, which 
would be 80 percent black, could run afoul of a court order for 
racially balanced schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``As I see it, the children should go where their parents want  
them to go,'' said Greta Ridley, a 65-year-old retiree who is 
raising her grandson. The 10-year-old had repeated fourth grade at 
a school Ridley didn't like. 
</P>
<P>
	She felt lucky to get him into another charter school this year.  
But many more families are waiting, since Justice Department 
opposition postponed the opening of The United Charter School, 
scheduled to move into a vacant inner city mall this year in a 
predominantly black neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, decades-old desegregation decrees -- meant to help  
families like Ridley's gain equal access to a quality education -- 
are being targeted by poor, minority parents who see charter 
schools, vouchers and other education experiments as their best 
hope. They and other charter school advocates, tired of waiting for 
the progress promised by desegregation, are joining in lawsuits to 
end court-ordered actions pending in 20 states. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department has blocked just three of nation's 1,700  
charter schools, officials told Congress Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	A charter school, created by a group of teachers, community  
members or parents, is free of most state laws and regulations. A 
charter outlines its goals and procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the schools in Lufkin, Texas; Oktibbeha County, Miss.;  
and Georgetown County, S.C., most charters are usually too small to 
disturb segregation patterns, Anita Hodgkiss, a deputy assistant 
attorney general, told the House Judiciary Committee's subcommittee 
on constitutional issues. And desegregation orders nationwide could 
only affect about 50 more charters, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, parents have the impression the department ``plans to  
do everything in its power to prevent the opening of certain 
charter schools,'' said Andy Kopplin, education policy adviser to 
Louisiana Gov. Mike Foster. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Baton Rouge case, Hodgkiss said, the 650-student United  
Charter School could have in effect added another ``one-race'' 
school to a system without financial resources to desegregate 50 of 
its 97 schools. So the Justice Department declined to help the 
school get court approval to open despite desegregation orders. The 
school's fate depends on whether local board officials decide it's 
worth the time and money to go to court on its behalf. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents are willing to do just that, said Clint Bolick of the  
Institute for Justice, a pro-school choice Washington law advocacy 
group. Bolick said the group plans to file suit next month, 
representing families in Baton Rouge and elsewhere who want to 
challenge desegregation orders to protect their charter schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``The formation of an all-black school should not thwart the  
creation of these schools if the school is affirmatively chosen by 
parents,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But charters are not a panacea for low-income minority families,  
civil rights advocates say. 
</P>
<P>
	``These schools must not be allowed to operate without  
consideration to the damage it may cause to the fragile 
desegregation implementation in the East Baton Rouge Parish school 
system,'' said Victor Kirk, city businessman who once worked for 
the district and directed Baton Rouge-branch of the civil rights 
watchdog Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now. 
``Charters must not be insulated from failure nor particularly 
removed from public scrutiny.''

<HEADLINE> Falcons' Chandler Likely To Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) -- The Atlanta Falcons finally won a game last  
Sunday after losing their first four. On Thursday, they received 
more good news when quarterback Chris Chandler was deemed ready to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would say he's been upgraded from questionable to  
probable,'' coach Dan Reeves said following practice. ``It looks 
pretty good. He's had two good days of practice. I think he'll be 
able to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler injured his right hamstring in the season opener,  
missed the next game, tried to come back too soon and played only 
the opening quarter in a 34-7 loss to the St. Louis Rams in the 
third game before sitting out the last two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler will likely start Sunday against the Rams (4-0), the  
only unbeaten team in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	In Chandler's appearance Sept. 26 against St. Louis, he  
completed 5 of 9 passes for only 28 yards and one interception 
before reaggravating his hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Reeves stopped short of saying Chandler will start, the  
12-year veteran has been listed No. 1 on the depth chart all 
season. Backup Tony Graziani started three of the last four games. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler was unavailable for comment after practice.  
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta is 17-4 when Chandler, a Pro Bowler the last two years,  
has started and finished a game -- including 10-1 last season when 
the Falcons went to the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	With Chandler out and running back Jamal Anderson sidelined for  
the season with a knee injury, the Falcons offense has stalled. 
Atlanta is averaging 12.2 points per game, third worst in the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's frustrating, because we know we're a better football team  
than the numbers show,'' said center Robbie Tobeck. ``It's not an 
excuse for us to say we've missed Chris and Jamal -- it's a fact. 
Those are the kinds of players you can't replace. 
</P>
<P>
	``But that doesn't mean we can't be a good football team. There  
are still enough players left from a team that went to the Super 
Bowl to get out of the mess we put ourselves in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Chandler's absence, Graziani has thrown for only 509 yards  
and two touchdowns. The running game hasn't done much either. Byron 
Hanspard is averaging only 3.0 yards per carry, Ken Oxendine 2.7 
yards and neither has scored a TD.

<HEADLINE> Seattle Center Making a Comeback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KIRKLAND, Wash. (AP) -- When surgeons cut into Kevin Glover's  
back in December, they found a lot more damage than they expected. 
</P>
<P>
	A five-hour operation left the Seattle Seahawks center wondering  
if his NFL career was finished. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd be lying if I stood here and told you that I knew for sure  
I was coming back, because I didn't,'' Glover said Wednesday at 
practice. ``My wife thought it was over, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But after missing the second half of his 14th NFL season with  
what was believed to be a pinched nerve and turned out to be a 
fractured disc, Glover is going strong in his 15th year of pro 
football. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seahawks are happy with the way he's playing and he's  
ecstatic. 
</P>
<P>
	His doctors told him if he worked hard enough at rehabilitation  
he could have a successful comeback. He worked hard enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``My back's been doing fine,'' he said. ``I had a little bit of  
pain in the second week of (training) camp when we had one of our 
scrimmages, but since then I haven't had any pain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glover, 36, has become an inspiration to his teammates,  
particularly the other offensive linemen. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's incredible that he's back from that injury,'' said guard  
Pete Kendall. ``You look at the scar on his back and you just shake 
your head.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's been a year of adjustment for all the Seahawks, who have a  
new head coach in Mike Holmgren. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kevin coming back was a big deal for our offensive line,  
because he's experienced and he's also real bright,'' Kendall said. 
``He picked up the system real fast. So he's been a big help for us 
guys by being able to come back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the Seahawks (3-1) play at San Diego (3-1) on Sunday in a  
battle for first place in the AFC West, Glover will be playing his 
190th NFL game and making his 174th start. 
</P>
<P>
	He came to Seattle as an unrestricted free agent last year after  
13 seasons in Detroit, where he was a three-time Pro Bowler and 
blocked for Barry Sanders. The Lions made him a second-round draft 
choice out of Maryland in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Glover was injured last season during a practice. Before  
undergoing surgery, walking had become difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of his rehabilitation during the offseason, when he was at  
home in Columbia, Md., involved swimming. Imagine a 6-foot-2, 
282-pound center in a swimming pool. Then imagine him surrounded by 
senior citizens getting their exercise. 
</P>
<P>
	Glover laughs at that picture, too.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was kind of a humbling experience,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Here I've been in the league 14 years and playing with some of  
the greatest athletes in the world, and most of the people in the 
swimming pool were in their mid- to upper- 70s, people who had had 
knee replacements and hip replacements. It was like starting all 
over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glover went through Holmgren's minicamps before he went to  
Cheney in eastern Washington, where the Seahawks train. He felt 
confident at training camp he was going to be healthy enough to 
play this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``But you still never know with back surgery and at my age,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Glover didn't need to come back for another season of paychecks.  
He has enough money. 
</P>
<P>
	He came back for something else.  
</P>
<P>
	``If you play a number of years and hopefully you take care of  
your money right, you don't need that. I'm enjoying playing again, 
there's no doubt about that. I think part of that has to do with 
getting injured last year,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never know. When you're at this point of your career and  
at this age your next game or your next play could be your last 
play. So because of that I'm trying to enjoy the game.''

<HEADLINE> Broncos Deciding Brister Role Fri. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Quarterback Bubby Brister appeared to be improving  
on Thursday, but the Denver Broncos still had made no decision 
about his availability for Sunday's home game against the Green Bay 
Packers. 
</P>
<P>
	Broncos coach Mike Shanahan said earlier in the week that  
Brister needed to practice by Friday if he expected to play on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Brister, elevated to the starting role over Brian Griese last  
week but sidelined by a strained muscle on his left side, did some 
light throwing before and after practice on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's improved,'' Shanahan said. ``He has a chance to push a  
little bit tomorrow and see how much progress he's made. Right now, 
I really don't know. But he said he felt a lot better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Running back Derek Loville and wide receiver Rod Smith both were  
listed as questionable on the Broncos' lengthy injury report, and 
neither appeared to be making progress. Loville has a strained 
hamstring and Smith a strained groin. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan sounded as if he wanted to rest Loville, the designated  
starter after Terrell Davis' season-ending knee injury, for another 
week.

	``I would probably put him as doubtful,'' the coach said. ``It's  
improved, but I'm afraid if we do push it tomorrow, it will set him 
back. I think if we wait until next Wednesday, then he'd be able to 
practice close to full speed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Loville said he can jog but has trouble accelerating.  
</P>
<P>
	``If I'm going to start,'' Loville said, ``I have to be able to  
burst. I can't do that right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for Smith, Shanahan said, ``The groin did not improve as much  
as we were hoping. We'll get a better feel (Friday).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cornerback-kick returner Chris Watson, who missed Wednesday's  
workout with a sprained ankle, rejoined drills on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan also said he hadn't heard from the NFL about whether he  
will be fined for not promptly reporting Brister's injury to the 
league. Brister was hurt on Friday, but the Broncos didn't list him 
as injured until Saturday.

<HEADLINE> US May Veto House-Senate Land Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton seems to be leaning toward a  
veto of a House-Senate compromise on a $14.3 billion measure 
financing the Interior Department and cultural programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican bargainers from the two chambers neared agreement on  
the bill on Wednesday. Though they weakened some provisions helping 
oil and mining companies, Democrats and other opponents complained 
that the language remained too anti-environmental. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once again, the leaders of the Republican majority are  
polluting our spending bills with special interest riders,'' 
Clinton said at the George Washington National Forest in Virginia, 
where he announced plans to preserve federal forests 
</P>
<P>
	``Let me be clear,'' he said. ``If the Interior bill lands on my  
desk looking like it does now, I will give it a good environmental 
response. I will send it straight back to the recycling bin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spoke before the House-Senate bargainers finished their  
work. But White House spokesman Barry Toiv said that based on what 
was known about the House-Senate deal, ``They have not addressed 
all the concerns raised by the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens, R-Alaska,  
said the bill was ``almost signable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would provide about one-third of the $800 million  
Clinton proposed to buy park land for the federal and state 
governments. Overall, it falls about $800 million short of what the 
president sought for the Interior Department and other agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	In a tentative agreement, the bill would let oil companies  
drilling on public lands avoid paying higher royalties to the 
government for up to six more months while a congressional study of 
the issue is completed. The higher payments have been delayed for 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Many hard-rock mining companies now using federal lands would be  
exempted from an Interior Department ruling limiting the size of 
their waste dumps to five acres. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the few loose ends in the Interior bill was a  
House-Senate dispute over how much to provide for the National 
Endowment for the Arts. The House was holding out for $5 million 
less than the $103 million the Senate prefers. Clinton asked for 
$150 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill contains money for several projects that appear in  
neither the House or Senate versions of the bill, including: 
</P>
<P>
	--$22 million to help Alaskan communities where lumber plants are  
closing, won by Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
	--$39 million to prop up a financially ailing fund that finances  
health care for more than 60,000 retired mine workers, won by Sen. 
Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.

<HEADLINE> Possible Calif. Corruption Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Calif. (AP) -- The FBI has launched a far-reaching  
corruption investigation in this San Francisco Bay-area city, 
asking as many as 60 power brokers, politicians and campaign 
contributors if they know of payoffs or bribes to City Council 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	Political, labor and church leaders have been subpoenaed to  
testify before a federal grand jury in Oakland in the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI spokesman Charlie Johnson would not confirm the  
investigation Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	But some of the people interviewed by FBI and Internal Revenue  
Service agents said they arrived as early as 6 a.m. at the doors of 
City Council members, council candidates and people who have done 
business with the city. 
</P>
<P>
	City Manager Isiah Turner, who was interviewed and subpoenaed  
Wednesday, told the Contra Costa Times that agents asked for 
documents on city contracts with 12 companies dating back to 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Richmond's mostly black power structure and a mostly white-owned  
commercial base have struggled to overcome the city's reputation 
for financial problems and crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Another large-scale federal probe in 1984 also involved possible  
corruption on the City Council and with a political consultant. No 
one was charged.

<HEADLINE> Grizzlies' Vukota Suspended, Fined </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Mick Vukota of the Utah Grizzlies has been  
suspended for eight games and fined $250 for attempting to injure 
Claude Boivin of Long Beach in the closing minute of an IHL game 
last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Long Beach GM-coach John Van Boxmeer was suspended for two games  
for his part in a melee at the players' benches that saw players 
from both teams swinging their sticks before play resumed. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah's Joe Frederick was fined an undisclosed sum for his part  
in the melee. Frederick was not dressed for the game but became 
``verbally involved in the altercations that were taking place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seven players who had been ejected yet returned to the bench  
area also were fined. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a situation that I felt needed to be addressed right  
then and there for our hockey team,'' Van Boxmeer said in 
explaining his role. ``I am disappointed about the suspension but 
there is no place in the game of hockey for what happened in Utah 
and I feel that the league made the correct call. We are willing to 
accept the punishment and move on.''

	Some other treaties:  
</P>
<P>
                      *NATO ENLARGEMENT (1998)   	
</P>
<P>
	The Senate voted 80-19 on April 30, 1998, to ratify the first  
post-Cold War expansion of NATO, easing the way for the addition of 
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic while opening the door for 
other former Soviet satellites to join. The pact had broad 
bipartisan support. 
</P>
<P>
                      *CHEMICAL WEAPONS (1997)   	
</P>
<P>
	Clinton went all-out to win Senate ratification of the Chemical  
Weapons Treaty in April 1997. The Senate approved it 74-26. 
</P>
<P>
                          *START II (1996)   	
</P>
<P>
	The Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty was ratified by the Senate  
in 1996 and would halve the U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals to 
between 3,000 warheads and 3,500 warheads each. It has yet to be 
ratified by Russia. 
</P>
<P>
                           *START I (1992)   	
</P>
<P>
	President Reagan opened negotiations with the Soviet Union to  
reduce strategic nuclear warheads on both sides. This evolved into 
the START I treaty signed in 1991 and ratified the next year on an 
overwhelming 93-6 Senate vote. 
</P>
<P>
                         *INF TREATY (1988)   	
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
                 *MONTREAL AVIATION PROTOCOLS (1983)   	
</P>
<P>
	The pact dealing with international aviation overflight rights  
and airline litigation liability was the last treaty rejected in a 
floor vote. It failed 50-42 in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
                           *SALT II (1980)   	
</P>
<P>
	President Carter withdrew the strategic arms limitation talks  
treaty from Senate consideration in 1980 after the Soviets invaded 
Afghanistan, which had hardened Republican and even some Democratic 
objections to an accord with Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
                    *PANAMA CANAL TREATIES (1978)   	
</P>
<P>
	President Carter scored one-vote margins of victory in 1978 on  
each of two treaties to relinquish U.S. control of the Panama Canal 
to Panama by the end of the century, after a bruising months-long 
battle. Both votes were 68-32. 
</P>
<P>
                *ANTI-BALLISTIC MISSILE TREATY (1972)   	
</P>
<P>
	The ABM treaty, which limits the scope of anti-missile systems,  
was an outgrowth of the first round of strategic arms limitations 
talks. It was presented to the Senate by President Richard Nixon 
and ratified 88-2 in August 1972. 
</P>
<P>
               *NUCLEAR NONPROLIFERATION TREATY (1969)   	
</P>
<P>
	The treaty banning spread of nuclear weapons to states that did  
not already posses them was sent to the Senate by President Johnson 
in 1968 but not ratified until March 13, 1969, after President 
Nixon took office. The vote was 83-15. 
</P>
<P>
                    *NUCLEAR TEST BAN ACCORD (1963)   	
</P>
<P>
	Banned all but underground nuclear tests. Sent to the Senate by  
President Kennedy. Ratified 80-19 on Sept. 23, 1963. The Soviet 
Union ratified the pact the next day and it went into force the 
following month. 
</P>
<P>
                            *NATO (1949)   	
</P>
<P>
	The original pact setting up the North Atlantic Treaty  
Organization was ratified 82-13 on July 21, 1949.

</P>
<P>
	The Senate vote 89-2 on July 2, 1948, ratifying the treaty that  
established the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
                      *LEAGUE OF NATIONS (1920)   	
</P>
<P>
	President Wilson saw his second term undermined by his failure  
to win Senate ratification for his League of Nations Treaty, also 
known as the Treaty of Versailles, both in November 1919 and again 
in March 1920 -- by a vote of 49-35, seven short of the required 
two-thirds.

<HEADLINE> Mets' Co-Owner Wants Bobby V Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- New York Mets co-owner Fred Wilpon doesn't think  
Bobby Valentine will quit after the season and doesn't take too 
seriously a report that his manager believes five of his players 
``basically are losers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're under stress and say things, you're sort of  
emotional,'' Wilpon said Thursday in the Mets' dugout while the 
team worked out on a windy day at Shea Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what to make of it, frankly,'' Wilpon said of the  
story in last week's Sports Illustrated. ``All of this came about 
when we were in the losing streak.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine reported that Valentine's wife, Mary, wants him to  
resign after the season. Wilpon gave the manager a vote of 
confidence during a seven-game losing streak in late September and 
said his co-owner, Nelson Doubleday, agrees that Valentine should 
return. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no question in my mind that he will manage the team  
next year,'' Wilpon said. ``I've talked to Nelson Doubleday about 
it. We want him back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilpon, whose primary business is real estate, said he has  
learned to work with different types of people reporting to him. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to be able to manage the emotions of other people, to  
get the most out of people,'' he said, using the example of a 
scientist who works in a lab in the middle of the night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to adjust to that, understand his psyche,'' Wilpon  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	And what is the psyche of Valentine, called the most hated man  
in baseball by a national sports magazine in a cover story last 
month? 
</P>
<P>
	``Very competitive,'' Wilpon said, ``wanting to win very badly.  
I think he's well prepared.''

<HEADLINE> Nation Knew JonBenet Only in Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- In a ruffled pink cowgirl outfit, JonBenet  
Ramsey bounced across the stage, flashing her million-dollar smile. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to be a cowboy sweetheart,'' she sang, with a white hat  
atop her moussed, golden curls. 
</P>
<P>
	The performance captured on video seemed especially poignant  
when it was played around the world after the 6-year-old beauty 
pageant participant was found strangled and beaten on Dec. 26, 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``This child was like a little doll,'' said a family friend, Dee  
Dee Nelson-Schneider. 
</P>
<P>
	She was born Aug. 6, 1990, in Atlanta to John Bennett Ramsey, a  
successful business executive, and his second wife, Patsy, a 
onetime Miss West Virginia. JonBenet was named after her father, 
with the name pronounced in a French-inspired manner as 
zhawn-ben-AY. She spent most of her life in the liberal mountain 
town of Boulder. 
</P>
<P>
	JonBenet attended High Peaks Elementary School, where she made  
the honor roll in the month before she died, and was a member of 
St. John's Episcopal Church. 
</P>
<P>
	Family and friends said she was an active, inquisitive, giving  
child who loved Shirley Temple movies. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last year of her life, JonBenet followed her mother's  
footsteps into beauty pageants. After her death, the world would 
take a closer look at the children's beauty pageant circuit, where 
youngsters parade in makeup and elaborate hairstyles, sometimes 
when they are barely out of diapers. 
</P>
<P>
	She learned how to walk, gesture and perform and collected a  
wardrobe of elaborate costumes, including that of a Las Vegas 
showgirl and a cowgirl. Although JonBenet loved to perform, family 
and friends said the competitions did not rule her life. 
</P>
<P>
	In her last months, JonBenet charmed judges into awarding her  
the titles of Little Miss Colorado, Little Miss Charlevoix, Mich., 
Colorado State All-Star Kids Cover Girl, America's Royale Miss and 
National Tiny Miss Beauty. 
</P>
<P>
	As they traveled to competitions, mother and daughter would sing  
their favorite song, a tune from ``Gypsy,'' a musical and movie 
about a mother obsessed with making her daughter a star. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wherever we go, whatever we do, we're gonna get through it  
together,'' they would sing, a minister told mourners at JonBenet's 
funeral. 
</P>
<P>
	JonBenet was buried in Marietta, Ga., next to the grave of her  
half sister, Elizabeth Ramsey, 22, who died in a car crash in Ohio 
in 1992. In the coffin, she was dressed in a beauty pageant dress 
and tiara, with a stuffed toy animal in her arms. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, nearly three years later, a grand jury has completed its  
investigation and a prosecutor said there will be no indictments.

<HEADLINE> Origin Linked to Immigrants' Wealth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Asian immigrants are the best-off financially  
of all foreign-born Americans, with median incomes higher even than 
native-born Americans, the Census Bureau says. 
</P>
<P>
	For all households with a foreign-born householder the median in  
1997 was $30,000, compared with $36,100 for households with a 
native householder, the agency said in a report being released 
Friday. For Asian-Americans, the median household income -- meaning 
half the households earned more and half less -- was $42,900. 
</P>
<P>
	By comparison, householders from Europe had a median income of  
$31,300, while it was $24,100 where they were from Latin America, 
the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The foreign-born population of the United States at the end of  
the 20th century cannot be neatly categorized, but we do see links 
between region of birth and measures of social and economic 
well-being,'' said A. Dianne Schmidley, co-author with Campbell 
Gibson of ``Profile of the Foreign-Born Population of the United 
States: 1997.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The official poverty rate was 21 percent for the foreign-born  
population in 1996, compared with 12.9 percent for the native 
population. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the foreign-born, poverty rates ranged from 12.7 percent  
for those from Europe to 14.7 percent for Asians and 15.1 percent 
for South Americans. The South American rate did not include 
Mexicans, for whom the poverty rate was 33.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Among people aged 25 and over, 65.3 percent of the foreign-born  
population had a high school education compared to 84.4 percent of 
native-born Americans. The proportion was 83.9 percent of the 
foreign-born from Asia, 78.9 percent of those from Europe and 47.0 
percent of those from Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said that in 1996, about 17.0 percent of native  
householders participated in one or more means-tested noncash 
programs, such as Medicaid. 
</P>
<P>
	Among foreign-born householders, those participating in these  
programs were 13.9 percent of those from Europe, 17.5 percent of 
those from Asia and 21.4 percent of those from South America, which 
did not include Mexicans, for whom the rate was 35.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	As of 1997, about 54.1 percent of native workers had  
employment-based health insurance. For the foreign-born, the 
proportions were 53.6 percent of those from Europe, 51.5 percent 
from Asia and 44 percent from Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	In March of 1997, about 30.1 percent of native workers were in  
Managerial and professional specialty occupations. These 
occupations accounted for 37.8 percent of the workers from Europe, 
35.8 percent from Asia and 11.4 percent from Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	The average size of households with a foreign-born householder  
was 3.32 people, considerably larger than the average size of 2.56 
for households with a native householder. 
</P>
<P>
	The average was 2.41 per household for people from Europe, 3.26  
for people from Asia and 3.17 for people from Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	Homeownership was higher for households with a native  
householder than for those with a foreign-born householder, 67.8 
percent versus 47.1 percent. Homeownership rates were 62.6 percent 
for those with householders from Europe, 50.5 percent for those 
from Asia and 38.0 percent for those from Latin America.

<HEADLINE> Absorbing One Blow Too Many </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The tougher they are, the harder it is to walk away.  
</P>
<P>
	Exactly how much harder was illustrated this week by what Steve  
Young of the 49ers and Michael Irvin of the Cowboys had to say 
about their futures. 
</P>
<P>
	Both men, among the greatest football players of their era, got  
the kind of news nobody in the NFL likes to hear. 
</P>
<P>
	A neurologist treating Young after his fourth concussion in  
three years told the 38-year-old quarterback he couldn't play this 
weekend, nor for who knows how many more games to come. 
</P>
<P>
	A spinal-injury specialist treating Irvin painted a grim picture  
for the 33-year-old receiver -- a swollen spinal cord and herniated 
disc -- and told him to come back in two weeks for another, more 
revealing set of photos. 
</P>
<P>
	In a business where even a single hit can push the strongest man  
off a cliff, this is like being told you're teetering at the edge, 
having already absorbed one blow too many. Each man could step back 
with his legacy secured, his financial well-being assured and the 
likelihood of more healthy days ahead than behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Being tough guys, naturally, each said no.  
</P>
<P>
	Or at least not yet. Employing verbal maneuvers every bit as  
dazzling as the ones we're accustomed to seeing them make on 
Sundays, they disarmed the dangerous words, danced away from the 
troublesome ones or simply ignored the hits altogether. 
</P>
<P>
	After a battery of tests, Dr. Gary Steinberg said Thursday he  
made a recommendation to Young and the 49ers about whether he 
should continue to play. He declined to reveal it at Young's 
request, but Steinberg did say the reason we won't be seeing the 
quarterback for the time being is ``to allow his brain to 
recover.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, the likeliest way for that to happen is for Young to  
retire -- immediately. The problem is that he sounds so sensible 
discussing the problem that it's easy to assume he understands the 
risk involved and will wind up doing the right thing. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the first mistake. And something his agent said a few  
years ago reminds us of how long -- and how successfully -- a bright 
guy like Young can string people along. 
</P>
<P>
	``I finally figured out what Steve meant by a significant  
episode,'' agent Leigh Steinberg said. ``It meant he had to be 
carried off the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year's ``significant episode'' occurred almost three weeks  
ago and Young remains in a fog. Exactly how deep is illustrated 
this way: Everybody close to Young is advising him to leave, but he 
keeps garbling the message. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of my family and friends are saying what I'm saying: If  
there's concern, then we shouldn't do it,'' Young said. ``If there 
isn't and you can work through it and the doctor feels good about 
it, there's nothing mysterious about it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty cut and dried,'' he added. ``I really want to play  
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the interest of clarity, we'll reduce the message to a single  
word: 
</P>
<P>
	Don't.  
</P>
<P>
	Irvin's case is a little trickier. On one hand, the most  
important pieces of the medical puzzle are not on the table. On the 
other, defiance practically defines him. He will probably come back 
just to prove that he can. 
</P>
<P>
	When Irvin turned up at Cowboys headquarters after Wednesday's  
visit to the doctor, he was uncharacteristically subdued. That led 
to speculation he'd received some bad news, since Dallas coach Chan 
Gailey described his star as upbeat earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin, wearing a brace to protect his neck, explained away the  
difference by saying, ``Right now, all I know is not to move it 
much, and that's what I'm trying to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He wasn't looking any further than that. When a retirement  
question came up, Irvin sidestepped it like a matador. ``I don't 
want to get into answering questions about will I play,'' he said, 
``because I don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What he did know, for the first time in the dozen seasons he's  
been in the NFL, is what it felt like laying on the turf Sunday at 
Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia, wanting desperately to jump back 
up but being temporarily unable to move his arms and legs. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin recalled looking helplessly at the sky, being wheeled into  
an ambulance then slowly regaining the movement in his extremities. 
But as the panic eased, his concerns only grew. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just scared,'' Irvin said. ``I thought about not playing  
with my son.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Missing from his recollection of events was any mention of the  
sick cheering by a cluster of fans as Irvin lay motionless, then 
again as a gurney was wheeled onto the field. A fan quoted in the 
Philadelphia Inquirer the next day said, ``This makes our season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin said he didn't notice the howling at the time, but you can  
be sure it's been filed away. Other than Michael Jordan, there may 
not be an athlete alive who relished walking into an opponent's 
house with a bull's-eye on his back and then shutting up the locals 
with his play more than Irvin. 
</P>
<P>
	But if he were to take a pass on this one, nobody -- save the  
fans in Philly, maybe -- would blame him.

<HEADLINE> Tigers Replace Parrish With Garner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The Detroit Tigers replaced manager Larry Parrish  
with former Milwaukee Brewers manager Phil Garner, seeking a new 
direction for a team headed next season to a new ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	The team and Garner agreed to a four-year deal. Terms of the  
contract were not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tigers offered Parrish the opportunity to remain in the  
organization, the club said in a written statement. It didn't say 
if Parrish accepted. 
</P>
<P>
	Parrish said the last time he talked to a team official was a  
couple of days before the season ended. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract is believed to be worth at least $1 million a  
season, the Detroit Free Press reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Garner was fired in August after eight years at Milwaukee in the  
midst of a seventh straight losing season. 
</P>
<P>
	Garner's best season was in 1992, his first, before the payroll  
gap between teams got extreme. That season, he almost guided the 
Brewers past Toronto for the AL East title. Milwaukee now plays in 
the NL Central. 
</P>
<P>
	Getting Garner might indicate that the Tigers will raise the  
payroll for players. Garner was reportedly so frustrated by 
Milwaukee's comparatively low payroll that he planned to resign as 
manager there at the end of this season. 
</P>
<P>
	He said a few weeks ago that he hoped to join a team with a  
payroll of at least $50 million to $55 million, with the 
willingness to raise it by up to $8 million during the season to 
add players needed to make the playoffs, the Free Press reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tigers' payroll this season was $35 million, 20th-highest  
among 30 big-league teams.

<HEADLINE> Perez Continues NLCS Hitting Rampage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Eddie Perez didn't expect to face New York Mets  
left-hander Kenny Rogers again. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta catcher also didn't know what pitch he hit for a  
two-run homer that capped a four-run inning and gave the Braves a 
4-3 victory Wednesday and a 2-0 lead in the best-of-7 NL 
Championship Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez had a pair of hits, including a home run, and drove in two  
runs in Tuesday night's 4-2 win and had a single off Rogers in the 
second inning. 
</P>
<P>
	He figured he'd be facing a reliever after Brian Jordan hit a  
two-run homer to tie the game at 2 earlier in the inning and Andruw 
Jones singled, bringing Perez to the plate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to face him instead of somebody else, the fresh arm  
coming from the bullpen,'' Perez said of Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got surprised when they left him in there. And I saw every  
pitch he was throwing -- I was ready for him.''. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Turner Field crowd of 44,624 chanting, ``Ed-die!  
Ed-die!'' Perez hit the first pitch from Rogers over the left-field 
fence. 
</P>
<P>
	He wasn't quite sure what type pitch he hit for the homer.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was a changeup,'' he said, ``but to tell you the  
truth, I was looking for a curveball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perez, who is 4-for-7 (.571) in the two games, is 7-for-11 in  
NLCS play, going 3-for-4 last season against San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez, known primarily as the guy who catches Greg Maddux every  
fifth day during his first three years with the Braves, became 
Atlanta's starter when Javy Lopez was lost for the season on July 
25 with a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
	The .259 career hitter batted .249 with seven homers and 30 RBIs  
in 104 games, starting a career-high 89 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is probably not going to hit 35 or 40 home runs like Javy  
could, but he might,'' Braves manager Bobby Cox said of Perez. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez knows when next year comes around and a healthy Lopez  
returns, he'll again be the backup. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think next year they'll forget about me because Javy will  
play every day,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Until then, however, Perez is doing just fine.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've been enjoying this since I've been playing every day.  
It's a good feeling,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *HE'S WALKING:* Chipper Jones has drawn five walks in the first  
two games, tying the NLCS record for most walks in consecutive 
games set by Jim Wynn of Los Angeles in 1974 and Darren Daulton of 
Philadelphia in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Jordan, who follows Jones, has cleaned up. He hit a  
two-run homer in Atlanta's four-run sixth inning Wednesday to key 
the Braves' 4-3 victory. In the opening division series, Jordan hit 
.471 (8-for-17) with a home run and seven RBIs, driving in all five 
runs in Atlanta's 5-3 win over Houston in Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's huge,'' Jones said of Jordan's clutch hitting. ``They  
pitched me carefully and now they're going to have to start 
pitching BJ carefully. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that he has proven in those situations that he can  
meet the challenge,'' said Jones, who is 0-for-3 with the five 
walks after hitting .400 with seven home runs and 16 RBIs during 
the regular season against the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love it,'' Jordan said of the opportunities he's getting.  
``It's my competitive nature. I guess it's my football mentality. I 
love when people challenge me. 
</P>
<P>
	``And if the Mets want to continue to walk Chipper to get to me,  
then I'm just going to continue to take advantage of those 
opportunities,'' said Jordan, a former defensive back with the 
Atlanta Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think teams are going to start taking a look at our lineup  
and saying I'm probably the only sure out in the lineup right 
now,'' Jones said with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta third baseman, however, wasn't laughing about his  
defense, making errors in both Games 1 and 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's terrible. Pathetic. To be honest with you, I could  
complain about the infield, but it's not the infield, it's me,'' 
Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Game 2, Jones booted a one-out grounder by Melvin Mora, and  
Edgardo Alfonso followed with an RBI double, knocking out Kevin 
Millwood and closing the Mets to 4-3. John Rocker, however, came on 
and struck out John Olerud, walked Mike Piazza intentionally and 
struck out Robin Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 4-2 win in Game 1, Jones kicked a two-out grounder by  
pinch-hitter Shawn Dunston in the ninth. It would have been the 
third out. Dunston took second on a wild pitch and scored the 
second run when pinch-hitter Todd Pratt followed with a single. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, however, made a good play on the next hitter Rey Ordonez,  
throwing out the Mets shortstop to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have streaks you go through, like a hitter. It's  
frustrating,'' Jones said. ``It almost cost us the game and could 
have cost us the series.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *OLD HAT:* Tom Glavine will be making his 25th postseason start  
and 13th NLCS appearance when he pitches Friday in New York in Game 
3. 
</P>
<P>
	``It never gets old. That's what we play for every year, for us  
to be here and have a chance to go for the championship. So it's 
still a lot of fun,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Glavine is 9-11 in the postseason, only 3-8 in the NLCS, but  
owns a 13-5 career mark against the Mets and was 3-0 against them 
this season. Overall, the left-hander was 14-11 during the regular 
season. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *LOONY LEITER:* Al Leiter, the Mets' scheduled Game 3 pitcher,  
is considered weird and doesn't deny it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm left-handed. I guess you can go from there. I like to have  
fun. I joke around a lot,'' said Leiter, who was 13-12 during the 
regular season and has a 1-1 postseason record, including a loss to 
the Braves in the 1997 NLCS when he was with Florida, which beat 
Atlanta and won the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's face it, we're playing a baseball game. Yes, it's  
serious. Yes, I want to win, but I goof around maybe a little bit 
more than most,'' said Leiter, who was 0-2 against the Braves this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ETC:* Only two teams have come back from 2-0 deficits in the  
NLCS. The 1985 Cardinals beat the Dodgers in six games and the 1984 
Padres, who lost the first two games to the Cubs. ... The Mets' 
3-4-5 hitters John Olerud, Mike Piazza and Robin Ventura have gone 
a combined 1-for-21 with just one RBI. Olerud has the hit and 
Piazza the RBI. ... With his appearance Wednesday, John Rocker 
extended his own NLCS record with his eighth consecutive game 
pitched. He appeared in all six NLCS games last season against San 
Diego and has been in both games this season, earning a save in 
Game 1.

<HEADLINE> Spurs' Robinson Limits Milan Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILAN, Italy (AP) -- David Robinson's annual battle with back  
problems will limit his playing time in the McDonald's 
Championship, San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson sat out the NBA champions' first exhibition game, a  
98-97 victory at Philadelphia on Sunday, because of a stiff lower 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	``His back's a little bit better,'' Popovich said after running  
his team through a light practice, ``but we don't want to do 
anything that could hurt him down the line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, who said he skipped Sunday's game as a ``precautionary  
measure,'' hopes to be on the court as much as possible in Milan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I imagine I'll be playing a big chunk of the time, because our  
No. 1 priority here is to win the games,'' the 1995 league MVP 
said. ``I have in my mind to play 40 minutes, if that's what we 
need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he acknowledged Popovich might see things differently.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what he's thinking from a coach's standpoint. Pop  
tends to be more on the cautious side,'' Robinson said, ``so he 
might just play me 20 minutes a night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio plays for the first time in this tournament in a  
semifinal game Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Play began Thursday as Brazil's Vasco da Gama defeated  
Australia's Adelaide 36ers 90-79 and Italy's Varese Roosters beat 
C.S. Sagesse of Lebanon 98-88. 
</P>
<P>
	``David usually takes three to four weeks each season to get his  
back in order for the rigors of the NBA season,'' Popovich said. 
``It's nothing for me to get too worried about right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The coach said he would attend Thursday's games, his first  
chance to scout San Antonio's potential semifinal and final 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson said he couldn't name a single player on any of the  
other five teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've watched a couple of the teams on tape, but never seen  
them up close,'' Popovich said. ``It's more difficult preparing to 
match up this way than if you are able to watch a team over a 
period of time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He will be using these games to prepare for his team's title  
defense, with a particular eye to finding a replacement at small 
forward for Sean Elliott, who had a kidney transplant in August. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a team that has to get used to itself,'' Popovich  
said. ``We have some new faces, like Samaki Walker and Terry 
Porter, and we need to see where they fit in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He certainly doesn't expect the Spurs to imperil the NBA's 16-0  
record in the 12-year history of the McDonald's Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``My players are serious. They understand this tournament is a  
big deal,'' Popovich said. ``We won't be loafing out there.''

<HEADLINE> CBS Show Breaks Obscenity Barrier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS's ``Chicago Hope'' medical drama broke an  
obscenity barrier for network television Thursday night with actor 
Mark Harmon's use of a common barnyard epithet. 
</P>
<P>
	Harmon, playing Dr. Jack McNeil, is hauled before a medical  
review board to explain why a promising teen-aged baseball pitcher 
had to have his arm amputated when an infection set in following a 
series of operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``---- happens,'' Harmon said, using an epithet for excrement.  
</P>
<P>
	Neither a CBS spokesman nor Henry Bromell, executive producer of  
the series, could remember a time when censors had allowed the word 
to be used. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nothing I haven't tried a couple of times before, except  
this time, I won,'' Bromell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since producers felt strongly that the word was important for  
artistic truthfulness, CBS chose to support them, spokesman Chris 
Ender said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly this is not something happening on a weekly basis,''  
he said. ``This is an isolated incident. It's not a sign or a 
signal that CBS is loosening its standards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CBS took special steps to respond to any of its more than 200  
affiliates who may have been concerned about offending viewers, he 
said. The network planned to feed the video to affiliates Thursday 
afternoon, instead of live Thursday night, to give the local 
stations the option of masking the word, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A handful of stations expressed concern upon hearing about the  
expletive, Ender said.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Banks Announce Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's Sumitomo Bank and Sakura Bank announced  
today that they will merge, forming what is expected to be the 
world's second-largest bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement comes just two months after three other major  
Japanese banks announced plans for a merger to create the largest 
banking group in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the merger was officially announced, government  
officials were already cheering the news. Finance Minister Kiichi 
Miyazawa said the merger would be good for the Japanese economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Media reports said the two banks were likely to merge over the  
next two years. The new bank is expected to have about $935 billion 
in total funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The combination would create a financial giant second only to  
the entity formed by the planned merger of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, 
Fuji Bank and Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets at those three banks exceed $1.2 trillion.  
</P>
<P>
	Sumitomo Bank and Sakura Bank are the core financial  
institutions in the corporate groupings that emerged from the 
prewar Sumitomo and Mitsui conglomerates. 
</P>
<P>
	Sumitomo Bank, which is based in Osaka, has about 15,000  
employees and 363 branch offices. Sakura Bank, Japan's first 
commercial bank, is based in Tokyo and has about 16,300 workers. It 
was renamed after a merger between Mitsui Bank and Taiyo Kobe Bank 
in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sumitomo and Sakura alliance would rival the DKB-Fuji-IBJ  
combination in both corporate and retail banking. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts saw the merger as the latest evidence of a trend toward  
alliances, some with foreign entities, that has reshaped Japan's 
financial system amid government moves to liberalize the sector. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will be a very good move for the Japanese banking  
sector,'' said Nozomu Kunishige, a banking analyst at Lehman 
Brothers, Japan. He said, however, that profitability would be a 
concern for the new entity unless it can carry out an effective 
restructuring policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The banking change in climate is largely the result of huge  
loans gone bad after a speculative lending rush of the late 1980s 
and early 1990s, saddling many banks with massive losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Most analysts agree the main problem of the sector is that it  
was overprotected by the government and has never been under much 
pressure to be competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	It has a dismal record as far as turning profits and has been  
slow in cost-cutting. 
</P>
<P>
	But over the past two years, the number of major Japanese banks  
has dwindled to 17 from 20, with the collapse of one commercial 
bank and two long-term credit banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Some experts predict that number could shrink to five or six.  
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Asahi Bank Ltd. and Tokai Bank Ltd.  
announced plans to combine next fall in a deal that will create 
Japan's third-largest bank.

</P>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- Frederick C. Belen, a former deputy U.S.  
postmaster general during the Johnson administration who helped 
initiate ZIP codes, died Wednesday. He was 85 and had Parkinson's 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Belen was assistant postmaster general for operations before  
being named to the second-highest job at what then was the Post 
Office Department. 
</P>
<P>
	He chaired the committee whose studies helped initiate and

	LONDON (AP) -- Maj. Gen. William Tait Campbell, the British Army  
officer who planned air operations for the Allied invasion of Italy 
during World War II, died Oct. 8. He was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell later served with the British command in Washington  
D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	As head of operations for the 1st Airborne Division, Campbell  
planned the British parachute and glider-borne assault on Sicily in 
July 1943 that combined with the U.S. Army's 82nd Airborne Division 
to pave the way for the sea landings by the American and British 
armies. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first large-scale Allied airborne invasion of the  
war. 
</P>
<P>
	He subsequently headed the newly formed Allied Airborne Army in  
August 1944, and after the war served at British Army headquarters 
in Washington D.C. For his wartime service he was designated a 
Companion of the British Empire, and awarded the U.S. Bronze Star.

<P>
	Glazer handled tax returns and other finances in Hollywood for

Chemical Bank and the U.S. Golf Association, died Monday. He was 
104. 
</P>
<P>
	So legendary was his knowledge of the rules of golf and his  
devotion to the game, that in 1995 the USGA designated the Ike 
Grainger Award to recognize people who have volunteered for the 
USGA for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Grainger was chairman of the USGA committee that in 1951  
negotiated the first uniform code of rules with the Royal and

<HEADLINE> IRS Says Tax Delay Could Be Costly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Because of delay in Congress, the Internal  
Revenue Service says it faces up to $11.5 million in extra printing 
and mailing costs, and risks confusing taxpayers over how to deal 
with the alternative minimum tax. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will do our best to provide help to every taxpayer who  
needs it, given the uncertain legislative situation,'' IRS 
Commissioner Charles Rossotti told congressional leaders in a 
letter. 
</P>
<P>
	Millions of middle-class taxpayers who claim personal credits  
such as the $500 per-child credit could be required to calculate 
both their regular income taxes and alternative minimum taxes 
unless Congress acts to exempt those credits from applying to the 
AMT. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 1 million of those taxpayers could get hit with  
unexpectedly higher income taxes -- and those numbers will only get 
higher because AMT is not indexed for inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	A one-year exemption passed last year has expired. The House and  
Senate are far from agreement on legislation extending the 
exemption -- included in bills that would renew several popular 
business tax breaks -- and President Clinton is threatening to veto 
any tax bill that spends some of the future non-Social Security 
surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	The morass on Capitol Hill is causing big headaches at the IRS,  
which is preparing tax forms and instructions that assume the 
personal credits exemption for AMT will be continued. 
</P>
<P>
	But just in case the exemption lapses, the IRS is prepared to  
print up a 16-page supplement of forms and instructions that would 
be mailed to taxpayers by Jan. 15. A notation explaining the 
situation will be included in the original package and on the IRS 
Internet site. 
</P>
<P>
	If the provision is extended, the IRS may send a follow-up  
postcard to assure taxpayers of that fact. Total cost is estimated 
at between $7.5 million and $11.5 million, Rossotti said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to act now to assure timely delivery of tax forms and  
instructions to individuals,'' Rossotti said in the letter dated 
Tuesday. ``Unfortunately, despite our best efforts, some taxpayers 
still may be confused.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is broad bipartisan support on Capitol Hill for extending  
the AMT fix. But there is disagreement about how to pay for it and 
how long the exemption should last. 
</P>
<P>
	A $23.3 billion bill approved by the House Ways and Means  
Committee would make the AMT fix permanent and extend other 
expiring tax provisions for five years. It has drawn opposition 
from Democrats and a veto threat from Clinton, however, because it 
would spend surplus dollars in four of its five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're for the extenders,'' House Minority Leader Dick  
Gephardt, D-Mo., told reporters Thursday. ``We just think you have 
to pay for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The AMT would have been gradually abolished by the $792 billion  
Republican tax cut vetoed by the president in September. Rep. Bill 
Archer, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, blamed the higher 
IRS costs on the administration's opposition to using any surplus 
dollars for both the big tax cut and the slimmed-down bill of 
extensions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got that bill out of committee in plenty of time,'' said  
Archer, R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Finance Committee, meanwhile, is struggling for a  
bipartisan agreement on a more modest package of tax extensions 
currently estimated at $7.8 billion. A draft of that bill, which 
would be paid for with a variety of revenue raisers, would extend 
the AMT fix for two years.

<HEADLINE> Senators Resolve Waco Inquiry Spats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A squabble that stalled a Senate investigation  
into the Justice Department's handling of Waco and allegations of 
Chinese espionage and campaign fund-raising abuses was resolved 
Thursday when the Senate Judiciary Committee shelved a task force 
boycotted by Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Selecting a new venue for the inquiry into possible Justice  
missteps, the committee abandoned the task force concept endorsed 
by Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and directed its 
administrative oversight and courts subcommittee to take over the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats had refused to participate in the task force, saying  
its creation would violate Senate rules and would result in little 
more than a partisan witch hunt against the Justice Department and 
Attorney General Janet Reno. 
</P>
<P>
	The Judiciary Committee's top Democrat, Sen. Patrick Leahy of  
Vermont, welcomed the task force's demise. ``You would have a 
result that nobody would believe in,'' he said. ``It would be seen 
as a partisan result.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans and Democrats alike pledged cooperation, backing  
that up with a unanimous vote to issue subpoenas Tuesday if the 
Justice Department doesn't produce a wide range of documents 
demanded by the committee. The senators also unanimously asked Reno 
to appear next Thursday before a closed session of the 
subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've already provided the full committee with thousands of  
pages of documents related to these matters,'' said Justice 
spokesman Myron Marlin. ``But we will continue to determine what 
else we can provide consistent with the law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., who was tapped to head the task force  
and will lead the subcommittee inquiry, said he reluctantly agreed 
to the change after Democrats promised to cooperate in the hiring 
of investigative staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the task force was the preferable way to go but with  
the assurances that we have of bipartisan cooperation, I'm prepared 
to make that accommodation,'' he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Specter does not normally even serve on the subcommittee, but  
the panel's chairman, Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, relinquished 
his leadership for the purposes of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I defer to Specter's competence as a prosecutor and a lawyer;  
and I'm not a lawyer,'' said Grassley. He said he 
``enthusiastically'' supported the move. 
</P>
<P>
	The probe was proposed weeks ago during the furor spawned by  
Justice and FBI officials' belated admission that potentially 
incendiary tear gas canisters were fired at the Branch Davidian 
cult compound in Waco, Texas, on April 19, 1993. The 51-day 
standoff ended that day as the wooden complex burned to the ground. 
About 80 cult members died. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Republicans later insisted on expanding the inquiry, and  
said Thursday that Justice's handling of allegations of Chinese 
espionage at U.S. nuclear labs will be their top priority. 
</P>
<P>
	The subpoenas approved seek documents on the nuclear espionage  
allegations and on cooperation or plea agreements with Democratic 
contributor Johnny Chung and fund-raisers Charlie Trie and John 
Huang. 
</P>
<P>
	Also requested was former Justice prosecutor Charles LaBella's  
memo to Reno in which he pressed for an independent counsel to 
probe White House fund-raising practices during the 1996 election. 
Reno declined to seek appointment of such a prosecutor.

<HEADLINE> Iowa Schedules Earlier Caucuses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Unable to persuade New Hampshire to  
change its primary date, Iowa's Republican and Democratic leaders 
announced plans Thursday to move their state's leadoff caucuses to 
Jan. 24, a week earlier than planned. 
</P>
<P>
	State Republican Chairman Kayne Robinson said officials need to  
find a way to bring stability to the political calendar. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we don't get a handle on this among the states that are in  
this first-in-the-nation area and have some stability here, yes, we 
will be threatened,'' said Robinson. ``We don't want that 
uncertainty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans and Democrats use different methods to set caucus  
dates, but work together to have them on the same day. Iowa 
Democrats must win approval from the national party's rules 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect that to happen,'' Democratic Secretary of State Chet  
Culver said at a separate news conference. ``I don't want to have 
to go through this again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa Republicans are free to set their date without national  
party approval. 
</P>
<P>
	The move comes after days of private discussions about the 2000  
political calendar of primaries and caucuses that yield 
presidential nominees. 
</P>
<P>
	The Iowa caucuses had been set for Jan. 31, but New Hampshire  
officials unexpectedly scheduled their primary on Feb. 1. They 
refused to push it back to Feb. 8 despite the entreaties of Iowa 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan. 24 is the earliest date for the caucuses since 1980, when  
they were held Jan. 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa originally set its caucuses for Feb. 21 but that date was  
gradually moved earlier as other states set early primary and 
caucus dates in an enormously front-loaded political calendar. 
</P>
<P>
	Roughly 75 percent of the delegates will be picked by March 7,  
and both parties are virtually certain to have a nominee within six 
weeks of Iowa's opening test. 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa reached the conclusion that it had no choice but to move  
the caucus date to Jan. 24 to preserve its leadoff status, Robinson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a difficult thing and it's a terribly inconvenient  
thing,'' Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, it's a massive logistical chore. Each party will have  
to find more than 2,000 caucus sites across the state. The two 
parties also will have to reshuffle the logistics of totaling the 
votes, and there's certain to be a major hotel shortage with the 
thousands of journalists and assorted others who descend on the 
state on caucus night. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite that, the state's political leaders concluded that  
holding the caucuses the night before the New Hampshire primary 
likely would dilute their impact and jeopardize their role in the 
presidential selection process. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight between Iowa and New Hampshire is also certain to  
spark a review of the lineup for the next presidential election. In 
past election cycles the two states have banded together to fend 
off challenges from other states seeking a slice of the attention 
given to states which open the nomination process. 
</P>
<P>
	The battle will shift Friday to Washington, where New Hampshire  
and Iowa Democratic officials will meet with a national party 
committee that governs the political calendar. The panel is 
expected to approve the shift to Jan. 24, but the vote wasn't 
absolutely certain, senior Democrats in Washington said. 
</P>
<P>
	That panel could sanction states which don't follow an  
established calendar, but those sanctions are largely meaningless. 
More importantly, the panel begins meeting next month to talk about 
the lineup for the 2004 election, and members have said the fight 
this year makes it more likely the calendar will be jumbled in the 
next election cycle.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Mum on Paula Jones Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said he will have plenty to  
say about Paula Jones after he leaves the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Until then, he said with evident anger Thursday, he will keep  
mum about a judge's decision that he must pay a fine for lying in 
the former Arkansas state worker's sexual harassment case. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I am out of office, I will have a lot to say about  
this,'' Clinton said during a White House news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't challenged anything, including things that I  
consider to be questionable, because I think it is wrong,'' Clinton 
said. ``The American people have been put through enough and they 
need every hour, every day, every minute I can give them thinking 
about their business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In July, U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright ordered the  
president to pay about $90,000 for ``false, misleading and evasive 
answers'' in his January 1998 deposition in Mrs. Jones' sexual 
harassment lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	In that deposition, Clinton denied a sexual affair with former  
White House intern Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's lawyers said he will not challenge Wright's findings,  
and Mrs. Jones' lawyers said they will not seek more money. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has denied he propositioned Mrs. Jones in a Little Rock,  
Ark., hotel in 1991, while he was governor and she was a state 
employee. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones lawyers' drew Ms. Lewinsky into the case in an  
attempt to show a pattern of sexual misconduct by Clinton. 
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr then picked up the trail, and his 
investigation of Clinton's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky led 
eventually to Clinton's impeachment by the House. He was acquitted 
by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Clinton apologized for his behavior and pledged to  
return to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until I leave here, as I understand it now, all this is  
finished and I don't have to comment on it,'' Clinton said 
Thursday. ``And unless there is some reason I legally have to, I'm 
not going to say anything else that doesn't relate to my 
responsibilities as president as regards that. When I'm done, then 
I can say what I want to say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The five-year Jones case is all but over.  
</P>
<P>
	The July court award was on top of $850,000 Clinton paid to Mrs.  
Jones to settle her claim that Clinton made an unwanted sexual 
advance in the hotel room in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright dismissed Mrs. Jones' suit in April 1998. Mrs. Jones  
appealed, and Clinton eventually agreed to settle. He admitted no 
wrongdoing.

<HEADLINE> Charles Schwab Earnings Rise 27 Pct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Earnings of Charles Schwab Corp. rose 27  
percent during the third quarter, as the nation's leading discount 
and online brokerage impressed Wall Street on Thursday with the 
growth of its new accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	It reported a profit of $124.5 million or 15 cents a share, for  
the quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with $97.8 million or 12 cents 
a share, a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	That met the forecast of 15 cents by analysts surveyed by First  
Call/Thompson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwab stock rose more than 6 percent in trading on the New York  
Stock Exchange, rising $1.87 1/2 to $29.93 3/4 a share, as analysts cited 
gains in its new business. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwab said it was handling $595 billion in customer assets and  
6.3 million active accounts. It also said it brought in $25 billion 
in new assets during the third quarter, up 31 percent from the 
year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue for the quarter rose 25 percent to $883.7 million from  
$705.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	After profit nearly doubled in the second quarter, Schwab warned  
that earnings would not be as brisk in the second half of this year 
by big investments in technology, advertising and personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	For the nine months ended Sept. 30, the company earned $418.4  
million, or 50 cents a share, compared with $242.1 million, or 30 
cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue climbed to $2.82 billion 
from $1.95 billion.

<HEADLINE> 2.4 Million Lighters Recalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Shine International Trading of Flushing, N.Y.,  
is recalling 2.4 million cigarette lighters. 
</P>
<P>
	The Consumer Product Safety Commission said Thursday that  
children can ignite the lighters, posing a fire and burn hazard. 
Also, the lighters can leak fuel and remain on after use. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been three reports of malfunctioning lighters. Two  
lighters have continued burning after being put down, one 
spontaneously blew apart, and another burst into flames, causing 
minor property damage. 
</P>
<P>
	No injuries have been reported.  
</P>
<P>
	The recalled cigarette lighters are nonrefillable,  
oval-tube-shaped, with a solid colored plastic body and a metal 
top. The word ``SHINE'' is imprinted into the metal top. 
</P>
<P>
	Small stores and souvenir shops have sold the lighters  
nationwide from August 1998 through July 1999 for about $1. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission recommends customers stop using the lighters  
immediately and return them where purchased for a refund.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Senator Criticized by Son </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- A state senator who is sponsoring a  
ballot initiative that would ban gay marriages in California was 
criticized Thursday by his gay son, who called the measure 
``blind'' and ``uncaring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Knight, a cabinet maker in Baltimore, wrote an opinion  
piece in the Los Angeles Times attacking Republican Pete Knight's 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe, based on my experience, that his is a blind,  
uncaring, uninformed, knee-jerk reaction to a subject about which 
he knows nothing and wants to know nothing, but which serves his 
political career,'' he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	David Knight also wrote that after he told his father three  
years ago that he is gay and has a life partner, ``my relationship 
with my father was over. I can't begin to explain the hurt that has 
come from this rejection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The senator acknowledged publicly in 1996 that his son, who like  
him is a former fighter pilot, is gay and that the senator's 
brother died of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	At that time, Knight was trying unsuccessfully to get the  
Legislature to pass a bill -- similar to his initiative on the March 
7 ballot -- to block recognition of gay marriages performed in other 
states. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight has said he and his son disagree on gay marriages but  
respect each other's views. 
</P>
<P>
	``I regret that my son felt he needed to force a private, family  
matter into the public forum through an editorial,'' the senator 
said in a statement after the piece appeared in the Times. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although I don't believe he was fair in describing the true  
nature of our relationship, that is a subject which should remain 
between the two of us. I care deeply about my son.''

<HEADLINE> FCC Report Backs Loose Web Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Communications Commission should  
avoid stepping in to regulate high-speed Internet access over cable 
pipes and let market forces shape the future of this emerging 
market, according to a report by FCC staff. 
</P>
<P>
	The study released Wednesday by the commission's Cable Services  
Bureau doesn't rule out the possibility that the FCC could in the 
future force providers of cable Internet service to share their 
lines with competitors. But for the time being, the study asserts 
that government regulation is not warranted -- reinforcing the 
position the FCC already has taken. 
</P>
<P>
	Public interest groups and some Internet providers have argued  
that unless cable companies are required to open their systems to 
rivals, consumers won't have access to a variety of information 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC staff said the study offers further justification of why it  
is too soon for regulators to intervene. As of August, just a 
little more than 1 million consumers were subscribing to high-speed 
cable service in North America -- a fraction of the 40 million 
residential Internet subscribers total. So-called broadband access 
over cable lines provides connection speeds dozens of times faster 
than today's dial-up telephone modems. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of 2005, more than 11 million consumers will be using  
these cable connections. But the majority of Internet users will 
still rely on the traditional dial-up modems, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	With such small numbers, the staff study says, there is no  
evidence that cable operators will dominate the market in a way 
that is anti-competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll continue to look at this through the eyes of  
consumers,'' FCC Chairman Bill Kennard said in an interview. ``When 
we hear that consumers are being denied choice and openness in the 
broadband world, we will clearly have to take action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, he added, ``I don't think that's the case right now.''  
</P>
<P>
	The study also asserts that customer demand is likely to force  
cable companies to give other Internet service providers access to 
their systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Cable companies, Internet providers, consumer advocates and  
financial analysts offered opinions on whether government 
regulation was appropriate now, said Deborah Lathen, chief of the 
cable services bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one identified market failures that would justify  
intervention for us at this time,'' said Lathen. 
</P>
<P>
	The study also highlights concerns that regulation might slow  
how long it takes to get such advanced services to consumers 
nationwide. Potential investors indicated that the government's 
stepping in too soon could chill the flow of dollars toward 
building high-speed connections, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cable companies entering the market actually have spurred  
competition by other providers of high-speed connections, like 
telephone companies, according to the report. As of midyear, 
160,000 consumers were using digital subscriber lines from their 
phone companies, the report said. And some fixed wireless companies 
and satellite systems also will compete for customers in a few 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	But public interest groups oppose the wait-and-see attitude.  
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that 'watchful waiting' causes damage,'' wrote the  
Center for Media Education, the Media Access Project and others in 
a letter. 
</P>
<P>
	The head of the National Cable Television Association, Robert  
Sachs, said the study shows that competition is happening in the 
industry and ``that government regulation would only slow the 
delivery of high-speed Internet service to consumers.''

<HEADLINE> Gill, Grant Show Public Affection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- It looks like Vince Gill and Amy Grant have  
stepped into the ``House of Love'' they once crooned about. 
</P>
<P>
	The award-winning singers held hands and smiled at each other  
Wednesday during Gill's annual charity golf tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first public outing for the couple since last  
weekend, when Ms. Grant told The Tennessean newspaper in her 
hometown, Nashville, that Gill is her boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
	Gill, a native Oklahoman and country music star, said he doesn't  
know what all the fuss is about. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a single man. She's a single woman,'' he said. ``Yes,  
she's my girlfriend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gill, 42, divorced his wife, Janis, a member of the country duo  
Sweethearts of the Rodeo, in 1997. In June, Ms. Grant, 38, divorced 
husband Gary Chapman, also a recording artist and host of The 
Nashville Network's ``Prime Time Country.''

<HEADLINE> Fan To Open Frank Sinatra Museum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOBOKEN, N.J. (AP) -- Start spreadin' the news: Ol' Blue Eyes is  
back in town. 
</P>
<P>
	A fan is planning to open a museum dedicated to Frank Sinatra in  
a space next door to the singer's birthplace. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be really extra special,'' Ed Shirak Jr. said  
Wednesday. ``Frank has returned to his roots. He's in heaven, but 
he's back with us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The museum will open its doors on Dec. 12, Sinatra's birthday.  
It will house letters Sinatra wrote to Hoboken residents, 
photographs and personal possessions such as handkerchiefs and a 
suit he wore in the film ``Come Blow Your Horn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The inside of the 600 square-foot museum -- now an old knickknack  
shop -- will be laid out to resemble Marty O'Brien's, a bar 
Sinatra's father owned in Hoboken, and will also feature a stage 
for live performances. 
</P>
<P>
	A $5 admission fee will likely be charged, with profits going to  
charities, Shirak said. 
</P>
<P>
	A bronze star honoring Sinatra now sits in front of the store.  
His home, at 415 Monroe St., burned down years ago and the site is 
now a vacant lot. 
</P>
<P>
	Sinatra died May 14, 1998.

<HEADLINE> Kehres Guides Mt. Union to Titles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Knute Rockne is on the list. So is Frank  
Leahy, Barry Switzer, Tom Osborne and Bud Wilkinson. 
</P>
<P>
	But the best winning percentage belongs to the best college  
football coach you've never heard of, Mount Union's Larry Kehres. 
</P>
<P>
	Kehres (pronounced CARE' us) is 143-16-3 in his 13 1/2 seasons. The  
three-time defending Division III national champion Purple Raiders 
are 5-0 heading into Saturday's game against Otterbein. 
</P>
<P>
	With a victory -- it's 48th in a row -- Mount Union will surpass  
the mark set by Wilkinson's Oklahoma dynasty of the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
	Lots of programs across the country put together the occasional  
unbeaten season. Sometimes they even stretch it out for another 
year. But the Purple Raiders haven't lost since Dec. 2, 1995, a 
20-17 setback to Wisconsin-LaCrosse in the Division III title game. 
</P>
<P>
	But why this leafy, 2,000-student campus? Why Mount Union, which  
is situated (in more ways than one) between the Pro Football Hall 
of Fame in Canton and the tough sports-mad city of Youngstown? 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's something you can put your finger on,''  
Kehres said. ``I think a lot of other teams do the same things that 
we do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's just that nobody does them as well.  
</P>
<P>
	Lycoming College in Williamsport, Pa., hasn't lost a regular  
season game for four years. The unbeaten Warriors fought their way 
to the 1997 Division III championship game and a date with Mount 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they came out on the field, they expected to win,''  
Lycoming coach Frank Girardi said of the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
	Final score: Mount Union 61, Lycoming 12.  
</P>
<P>
	Mount Union doesn't just win the lopsided games, either. It won  
five times last year in games decided by a touchdown or less. 
</P>
<P>
	Just two weeks ago, the Purple Raiders trailed at rival John  
Carroll in every quarter and by a touchdown in the second overtime. 
Yet Mount Union prevailed 57-51 in an epic three-overtime game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't hate them,'' first-year John Carroll coach Regis  
Scaife said with a chuckle. ``As a matter of fact, I've got a lot 
of respect for Larry. He does a tremendous job and it's a good 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	``They play great defense and they execute well, but it's their  
offense that does it all. It's precision, it's like a machine. They 
find mismatches and they exploit you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kehres, who just turned 50, grew up a few miles from Mount Union  
in Diamond, population 200. After graduation from Southeast High 
School, he played quarterback for the Purple Raiders from 1967-70. 
Always drawn to offense, he threw 28 touchdown passes and still 
holds the Ohio Conference record for the longest pass completion. 
</P>
<P>
	After getting his master's degree, and a year as a high school  
coach, he returned to Mount Union. He spent 11 years as an 
assistant coach under Ken Wable, who won 220 games in 24 years at 
the school. Kehres became the offensive coordinator and turned the 
Purple Raiders into a pass-happy, try-anything team surrounded by 
schools still grounded in Woody Hayes' 
three-yards-and-a-cloud-of-dust attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Mount Union went 11-1 in 1985, its 21-14 loss coming to  
perennial champion Augustana in the school's first trip ever to the 
playoffs. Wable then retired and was replaced by Kehres. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wasn't building a program from the bottom of the deck,''  
said Wally Hood, the Otterbein coach. ``But he took the players he 
had and converted it into a system for the '90s. He was smart in 
adapting to a pass-oriented style. It appeals to recruits and it's 
fun to watch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kehres said he didn't take over with five-year plan.  
</P>
<P>
	``The owner of the Browns said a month or so ago that you don't  
really plan to win a Super Bowl championship,'' Kehres said. ``You 
get started, try to get the best people working for you and get the 
best players you can. Then you just go. You figure out the problems 
as they come up. That's all we've done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mount Union lost to Augustana in the second round of the  
playoffs again in 1986, then lost to Allegheny in the opening round 
in 1990. Taking the next step, they were beaten by Wisconsin 
LaCrosse 29-24 in the 1992 championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first time we made the playoffs, we felt we had to play  
the Green Bay Packers,'' Kehres said. ``It took us time to realize 
that playoff games are like playing good teams in your league and 
shouldn't be treated as something out of the ordinary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, led by a big quarterback named Jim Ballard who wasn't  
afraid to take a hit, the Purple Raiders finally broke through and 
won their first national title. 
</P>
<P>
	Disappointment followed with losses by one and three points in  
the playoffs the next two years -- all four of their postseason 
losses have come to the eventual national champion -- but there 
haven't been any disappointments or losses since. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Borchert quarterbacked the 1996-97 title teams. Now, junior  
Gary Smeck leads the offense. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's team has juniors or seniors starting at every spot.  
With 200 players on the roster, Kehres can afford to play veterans 
while the underclassmen wait their turn. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like the pros. Every year it's a different recruiting  
class and every four years you lose those kids,'' Girardi said. 
``At any level, when you do what he's done, people will say, 'How 
can they do it?' It's an astounding accomplishment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other jobs with bigger money and more exposure have been dangled  
in front of Kehres, but he hasn't ever really considered leaving 
Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Places are made special by friendships and that's what makes  
this place special,'' he said. ``This is partly my place. I've been 
here long enough that I can say that. If you stay somewhere as long 
as I have, you've got to feel like that.''

<HEADLINE> House Targets Funds for Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pushing aside school voucher plans, a House  
committee voted overwhelmingly Wednesday to continue targeting 
federal funds to the nation's poorest children, with a new emphasis 
on public school choice and quality teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	By a 42-6 vote, the House Committee on Education and the  
Workforce renewed Title I, the $8.3 billion program that helps 10.5 
million poor children in 90 percent of the nation's school 
districts, and sent the measure to the House floor. 
</P>
<P>
	A second bill, approved 26-19 along party lines, would give  
states greater flexibility in spending federal dollars on 
education. Democrats complained states could divert the money from 
poor students to wealthier districts. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee chairman, GOP Rep. Bill Goodling of Pennsylvania,  
said that if Congress passes the Title I bill, ``We will be sending 
a message to states, school districts, and schools: You must 
produce results, you must report your results, and you must improve 
program quality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican lawmakers and education researchers have said Title I  
is ineffective. The program was created more than 30 years ago to 
narrow the gap in academic achievement between low-income students 
and their classmates. 
</P>
<P>
	But lawmakers from both parties praised Wednesday's vote as  
ensuring that high standards will apply to poor children, who also 
will get the extra help they need. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation does not allow the parents of poor children to  
use federal dollar to send their youngsters to private school. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservative lawmakers on the committee backed voucher plans by  
GOP Reps. Tom Petri of Wisconsin and Bob Schaffer of Colorado. The 
proposals lost when Democrats were joined in opposition by 
Republicans such as Goodling, who wanted to move the bill ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	Petri said he might offer the voucher plan during floor debate,  
and added ``there is considerable interest in narrowing the gap 
between the wealthy and the poor by giving some flexibility in how 
the (federal) money follows the student.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The committee made few changes in Title I since it last was  
renewed in 1994. New this year include funding programs that give 
children in failing schools better options within their public 
school systems, and restricting how many teacher aides can be hired 
with federal funds. Some large urban districts, which have trouble 
recruiting teachers, were criticized for relying on Title 1 aides 
as primary instructors in some classes. 
</P>
<P>
	The second bill, the Academic Achievement for All Act, would  
give states added flexibility in spending federal education money -- 
part of a long-running debate focusing on federal vs. local control 
of schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, President Clinton signed a law letting states  
waive federal rules in some education programs. His education 
secretary, Richard Riley, has said the bill passed Wednesday went 
too far and promised to he would recommend a veto. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate, which has a similar school flexibility bill, plans  
to open debate on Title 1 and other programs in the 34-year-old 
Elementary and Secondary School Act, which governs $13.9 billion in 
federal programs. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The House bills are H.R. 2, and H.R. 2300.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A 39-year-old assistant to Kenneth Starr will  
take over the final phase of the independent counsel's 
controversial investigation that led to the impeachment of 
President Clinton, say sources familiar with Starr's plans. Starr 
will formally step aside next week and be replaced by Robert Ray, 
an assistant U.S. attorney who worked for Independent Counsel 
Donald Smaltz in the probe of ex-Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, 
say the sources, who are allies of Starr. A panel of three federal 
appeals court judges that selects independent counsels chose Ray 
after interviewing a number of people inside Starr's office as 
possible successors.

Palestinian prisoners from Israeli lockups, part of an interim 
peace accord signed Sept. 4. The prisoners will be driven to points 
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and released. Israeli officials 
said 83 will be taken to Gaza, including 37 citizens of Arab 
countries, jailed for attacking Israelis or for crossing the border 
illegally. Israel freed a first group of 199 prisoners on Sept. 9. 
The second release was held up for a week by a disagreement over

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton accused Senate Republicans

nuclear test ban treaty and warned, ``You'll see a lot of testing'' 
by Russia, China, India and Pakistan if the United States abandons 
the landmark agreement. Clinton pledged the United States would 
refrain from testing -- as it has since 1992 -- despite the treaty's 
rejection. ``It still binds us'' unless the president says 
otherwise, Clinton said. With Texas Gov. George W. Bush and other 
Republican presidential hopefuls opposed to the treaty, Clinton 
acknowledged that a future president might disavow the ban.

government said. The ultimate impact of the injunction still 
remains unclear. The U.S. Forest Service has yet to calculate the 
amount of timber awaiting sale subject to the injunction, spokesman 
Pete Pierce said Thursday. The injunction filed Sept. 28 affects 
timber sales of 250,000 board-feet of live timber or up to 1 
million board-feet of dead timber without the agency first

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Intel Corp. is paying $1.6 billion to buy DSP  
Communications Inc., a maker of microprocessors for mobile phones, 
in a bid to extend its dominance in computer chips to the coming 
boom in wireless devices with Internet access. DSP supplies 
integrated circuits and related system software for mobile phone 
manufacturers based on the wireless technology called digital 
signal processing. For Intel, the deal adds a key technology that's 
at the very heart of the latest rage in the technology and 
telecommunications industries.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The up close sounds of the game turned into the  
sounds of silence for Boston Red Sox manager Jimy Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams was wired for sound by Fox Television during Wednesday  
night's first game of the AL championship series, won by the New 
York Yankees 4-3 in 10 innings. He said he wouldn't do it again 
after a discussion on strategy was broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't do it anymore,'' Williams said before Thursday night's  
second game. ``I just don't feel right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he understands the value of bringing baseball closer to  
fans by broadcasting discussions. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're just trying to put people who have never been in the  
dugout, will never be in a dugout, give them an opportunity to see 
maybe what happens a little bit,'' he said. ``I have a respect for 
them for that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't necessarily like to do that and I won't do that  
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Mariano Rivera entered Game 1 to start the ninth inning,  
Williams asked coach Dave Jauss the prospects of stealing a base on 
the reliever. The agreement with Fox, he said, precludes 
broadcasting conversations about strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Weisman, Fox's executive producer for baseball, said  
Williams and Jauss discussed that strategy if leadoff hitter Jason 
Varitek reached base. After Varitek grounded out, the conversation 
was broadcast, Weisman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know when they played it,'' Williams said. ``I wasn't  
watching TV.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I spoke to Jimy about it and he has no problem,'' Weisman  
said. ``The information about Rivera's move to the plate, anybody 
in the stands can time it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said Williams had an on-off switch ``and, believe me, he  
turned it off throughout the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And, it seems, until further notice.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *AILING HURLER:* There were some raised eyebrows when Boston  
reliever Rich Garces left Wednesday's game after two hitless 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, it became clear why. His arm was bothering him.  
</P>
<P>
	``He couldn't go back out there the next inning,'' Williams  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Garces had been one of the Red Sox most effective relievers,  
posting a 1.55 ERA and 5-1 record in 30 games this season. On 
Wednesday night, he left after the sixth inning with Boston ahead 
3-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Derek Lowe relieved him and gave up the tying run in the  
seventh. In the 10th, Rod Beck's second pitch was hit by Bernie 
Williams for the winning homer. 
</P>
<P>
	Garces' arm is ``maybe a little tired. He'll be OK in a couple  
of days,'' Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *MARIANO THE MAGNIFICENT:* Nearly three months ago, Rivera  
allowed a run. 
</P>
<P>
	Really.  
</P>
<P>
	Since that game against Tampa Bay on July 21, the Yankees closer  
has pitched 35 2-3 innings in 31 games without letting an opponent 
cross the plate. Rivera pitched two scoreless innings Wednesday 
night, allowing one hit and picking up the victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had a number of successful closers who have pitched for  
me'' including John Wetteland, Lee Smith and Tom Henke, New York 
manager Joe Torre said. ``He has been consistent as any closer I've 
ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have not seen anything like it and hope I continue to say  
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre was concerned about his other relievers who have gotten  
little work in the playoffs because of the success of the starters. 
In the first four games, Orlando Hernandez went eight innings 
twice, Andy Pettitte pitched 7 1-3 innings and Roger Clemens went 
seven. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, Ramiro Mendoza, Mike Stanton, Hideki Irabu and  
Allen Watson didn't pitch in the three-game sweep over Texas or in 
Game 1 against Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a problem because you don't know how sharp they're  
going to be,'' Torre said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *EMOTIONAL TIME:* Scott Brosius, MVP of last year's World  
Series, struggled through a difficult season because of the illness 
of his father, Maury, who died of colon cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	He has managed to separate the personal and professional parts  
of his life and had three hits -- a home run, triple and single -- in 
Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if it's going to affect me or not as far as  
playing here,'' said Brosius, who is from Oregon. ``Certainly I 
think when this whole thing is said and done and I get home, I 
think that is when it will really affect me. But this time of year, 
I am supposed to be away. I am out playing baseball. I am not 
supposed to be at home, so some of those things I can kind of keep 
where they are until I go home to face them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brosius, missing only a double for the first hitter's cycle in  
postseason history, admitted it crossed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew I had a chance because I got the triple out of the way  
and I don't get too many of those,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In his last at-bat, however, he struck out.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ON A ROLL:* The Yankees took an 11-game postseason winning  
streak into Thursday night's second game against Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	New York swept the last three games of last year's AL  
championship series against Cleveland and four straight in the 
World Series against San Diego. Then there were three straight over 
Texas in the division playoff and the 4-3 victory in Game 1 against 
the Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	The streak is one short of the record 12 straight set by the  
Yankees with sweeps of the 1927, 1928 and 1932 World Series. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *THE WINDUP AND THE PITCH:* Dom DiMaggio and Carlton Fisk will  
throw out the first balls for Games 3 and 4 at Fenway Park on 
Saturday and Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio, brother of late Yankees great Joe DiMaggio, was an  
outfielder for the Red Sox from 1940-42 and 1946-53. Fisk is best 
known for his homer in Game 6 of the 1975 World Series that gave 
Boston a 7-6 victory in 12 innings over Cincinnati. As the ball 
sailed toward the left-field foul pole, Fisk waved in the direction 
of fair territory. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox lost the World Series with a 4-3 defeat in Game 7.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BACK TO WORK:* Yankees second baseman Chuck Knoblauch was in  
the starting lineup for Game 2 after X-rays on his right foot were 
negative. Knoblauch was checked after hitting a ball off his right 
foot in the ninth inning of the opener. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I came in (Thursday) he was laying on the table next to  
(Paul) O'Neill. They were both in the lineup, but it was never a 
question,'' Torre said. Yankees trainer Gene Monahan ``just felt it 
was a bruise, especially after getting the X-rays back.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SIGN OF THE TIMES:* A banner hanging from the upper deck  
Thursday night read: ``Babe's Curse is Y2K Compliant.'' The Red Sox 
last won the World Series in 1918 with Babe Ruth. They traded him 
to the Yankees in 1920. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *NOTES:* New York's Game 3 pitcher Roger Clemens left for Boston  
before Game 2. He's scheduled to pitch Saturday at Fenway Park 
against Pedro Martinez. ... The National Anthem in Game 3 will be 
performed by members of the Boston Symphony Orchestra under the 
direction of Music Director Seiji Ozawa and former Boston Pops 
conductor John Williams. ... The anthem for Game 4 will be sung by 
Lynn Saberhagen. Her husband, Bret Saberhagen, is scheduled to 
start that game for Boston.

<HEADLINE> House Votes To Better Truck Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House voted Thursday to create a separate  
agency within the Transportation Department dedicated to reducing 
truck accidents that now kill more than 5,000 on the nation's 
highways every year. 
</P>
<P>
	The new National Motor Carrier Administration also would get  
increased funding to target truckers violating safety rules and to 
monitor trucks crossing U.S. borders from Mexico and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	``We owe it to the driving public to ensure that the trucks with  
which they share the road are safe,'' said Rep. Bud Shuster, R-Pa., 
chairman of the House Transportation Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, passed 415-5, goes to the Senate.  
</P>
<P>
	The new agency would replace the Office of Motor Carriers, which  
operated under the Federal Highway Administration. Supporters of 
the new agency argued that the FHA's close relations with the 
trucking industry and its focus on construction impeded the OMC's 
safety work. 
</P>
<P>
	The new agency would give safety demands ``the priority that  
they deserve within the department's pecking order,'' said Rep. 
Nick Rahall, D-W.Va., ranking Democrat on the Transportation 
subcommittee on ground transportation. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration, which in the past had expressed doubts about  
the need to create a new safety office, endorsed the House plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater, in a letter to Shuster,  
said the bill and administration efforts ``create the potential for 
significant safety improvements'' and reaching a goal of cutting 
truck-related fatalities by 50 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Slater recommended the final bill require new commercial  
driver's license applicants to have alcohol and drug-free driving 
records for the past three years. He also wants in-vehicle training 
for new drivers and on-board recorders where appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
	Walter B. McCormick, Jr., head of the American Trucking  
Associations, hailed the bill as ``the culmination of a 15-year 
effort on the part of the ATA to see motor carrier safety given the 
same priority as air carrier safety.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would:  
</P>
<P>
	--Set aside $420 million over the next three years for safety  
program grants. 
</P>
<P>
	--Require that states receiving funds comply with expanded  
federal guidelines for issuing and disqualifying driver's licenses. 
</P>
<P>
	--Authorize the Transportation Department to suspend operations  
of a motor carrier that fails to pay civil penalties within 180 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	--Define standards by which the department can put a trucker out  
of service when it poses an imminent hazard. 
</P>
<P>
	--Increase from $500 to $10,000 the first-offense fines that can  
be levied on foreign carriers that violate U.S. trucking rules. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 5,300 people were killed and some 130,000 were injured  
in truck-related accidents last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Slater last week announced he was moving most of the safety  
operations of the Office of Motor Carriers into his own office. 
</P>
<P>
	He acted after Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., a leading truck safety,  
inserted language in the department's fiscal 2000 spending bill 
that barred further funding of the OMC as long as it remained under 
the FHA. 
</P>
<P>
	The House on Tuesday approved legislation that amended that ban  
to ensure that the department can continue levying fines against 
safety violators. 
</P>
<P>
	----	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 2679.

<HEADLINE> Patinkin To Star in 'Wild Party' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The guests have been signed for ``The Wild  
Party,'' a musical opening next year on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
	Toni Collette, Eartha Kitt and Mandy Patinkin will star in the  
show based on the Jazz Age poem by Joseph Moncure March. 
</P>
<P>
	The musical, written by Michael John LaChiusa, will be directed  
by George C. Wolfe, who runs the Public Theater. Opening night is 
set for April 6 at the Virginia Theater. 
</P>
<P>
	The production is the second ``Wild Party'' musical scheduled to  
play New York next year. Another version will open off-Broadway at 
Manhattan Theater Club in February, starring Taye Diggs. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1975 movie, which starred Raquel Welch and James Coco, used  
the poem as the taking-off point for a different story -- one about 
a Fatty Arbuckle-type comedian who gives a party to save his 
failing career. 
</P>
<P>
	The real-life Arbuckle was prosecuted and acquitted when a young  
woman died after a drinking party during Prohibition.

<HEADLINE> Consumers Paying Higher Bank Fees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bank customers are paying an average $217.32 a  
year to maintain a checking account when they can't meet 
minimum-balance requirements, up nearly 9 percent from $199.79 two 
years ago, a new survey finds. 
</P>
<P>
	And consumers with accounts at big banks are paying on average  
16 percent more than customers of smaller banks, the U.S. Public 
Interest Research Group said in its latest annual survey of bank 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
	An official of the American Bankers Association disputed the  
consumer group's findings, calling them ``completely misleading.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Most people figure out a way to reduce the cost'' of a  
checking account, often by having their paychecks deposited 
automatically into their accounts, James Chessen, chief economist 
of the bankers' group, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey comes as Congress edges toward a final vote on  
sweeping legislation that would lift Depression-era legal barriers 
and allow banks, securities firms and insurance companies to merge. 
</P>
<P>
	Many consumer groups, including U.S. PIRG, have opposed the  
legislation, saying it would increase the concentration of 
financial power in a few big corporations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Banks are punishing consumers with a relentless onslaught of  
more and higher fees,'' said Ed Mierzwinski, PIRG's consumer 
program director. ``Worse, many banks are hiding fee increases by 
adding new fees for services that used to come standard with your 
checking account.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the new charges include monthly ATM card fees, cancelled  
check fees, and fees for telephoning the bank or closing an 
account. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress will make the problem worse if it approves'' the  
financial overhaul legislation, which would make big banks bigger, 
Mierzwinski said. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey of 526 banks in 33 states and the District of  
Columbia found that the most expensive states to bank in are New 
York, Florida, Texas, Michigan and North Carolina. The least 
expensive are Nebraska, Missouri, Utah, Colorado and Arkansas, 
according to PIRG, which ranked states on the basis of several cost 
factors -- including monthly fees for checking accounts, minimum 
balance requirements, fees for using automated teller machines, 
bounced check fees and the number of banks offering free checking. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey also found:  
</P>
<P>
	--The average cost to maintain a regular checking account,  
without meeting minimum-balance requirements, at a credit union is 
$111.59 a year, compared with the $217.32 average at banks. 
</P>
<P>
	--Bank customers are paying an average $22.01 penalty for  
bouncing a check, up from $20.53 in 1997; $4.79 for receiving 
someone else's bounced check in your account (called a 
deposit-item-returned fee), down from $4.90 two years ago; and 
$19.19 to stop payment on a check, up from $18.17. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve, in a report to Congress this summer, found  
that ATM fees charged by banks and savings and loans increased 
significantly from 1997 to 1998 as did the number of institutions 
offering free checking. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank also found that in 1998, as in previous years,  
most of the fees charged by big banks operating in several states -- 
including those created by mergers -- were significantly higher than 
those levied by smaller banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has expressed concern over rising  
bank fees in congressional testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	But Chessen, the economist at the American Bankers Association,  
said consumers can keep their banking costs down by shopping 
around. 
</P>
<P>
	``Markets work and consumers are very smart, and they know how  
to get a good deal,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	PIRG's Mierzwinski suggested that consumers usually will find  
the best deals at credit unions or smaller banks. He advised them 
to look for free checking, or free or low-cost checking with direct 
deposit of paychecks. 
</P>
<P>
	The PIRG survey covered banks in Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas,  
California, Colorado, the District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, 
Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, 
Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, 
New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, 
Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, 
Washington and Wisconsin.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Lays Out Trade Talk Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Saying too few farmers are ``reaping the  
bounty they themselves have sown,'' President Clinton is promising 
to pursue new opportunities to export U.S. products and services -- 
starting with those found on America's farmlands. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton laid out the proposals for upcoming trade talks in  
Seattle during a speech Wednesday night before the Democratic 
Leadership Council. Besides agriculture, he also advocated 
expanding exports in manufacturing and high-tech service 
industries, saying they are key to unlocking the ``creative and 
entrepreneurial potential'' of the American people. 
</P>
<P>
	``Trade is no longer just agricultural and manufactured goods.  
It's construction and distribution and entertainment,'' Clinton 
said. ``America is the world's largest exporter of services, in 
quantity and quality. (But) too many markets remain closed to us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton wants the new round to include tariff reductions on  
manufactured goods and further broadening of global trade rules to 
cover high-tech service industries such as telecommunications, 
banking and securities, where U.S. companies are world leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	While the U.S. economy is enjoying strong growth with the lowest  
unemployment in nearly three decades, the trade deficit soared to a 
record $164 billion last year and is running at $247 billion rate 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration acknowledged that some major U.S.  
trading partners, such as Japan and the European Union, strongly 
oppose many of its negotiating goals. And some critics of the World 
Trade Organization contend that Clinton's plans to address labor 
and the environment in next month's talks do not go far enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``Public opposition to the WTO and the administration's approach  
on globalization increases every time President Clinton recycles 
the empty rhetoric on transparency, labor and environment,'' said 
Lori Wallach, director of Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton appealed for the 134-nation WTO to lend an unbiased ear  
to complaints from organizations outside government about expanded 
world trade. With nations' economies becoming increasingly 
interdependent, he said, the WTO cannot afford to shut out 
alternative views, even if they are ``dead wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The WTO has been treated for too long like some private  
priesthood for experts, where we know what's right and we pat you 
on the head and tell you to just go right along and play by the 
rules that we reach,'' Clinton said. ``The world doesn't work that 
way anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials said the United States would lobby hard  
to ensure its objectives were included at the talks in Seattle from 
Nov. 30 to Dec. 3. Clinton will attend the sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to globalize one way or the other,'' Clinton said.  
``I believe it is profoundly in our interest, and in the interest 
of the world, for America to be leading the pack.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also said he would pursue an agreement for China to join  
the WTO, hoping that would allow the Chinese people ``to feel that 
stability comes from openness, and not repression of thought, 
religion or political views.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But agriculture clearly was the top priority. The United States  
wants to totally eliminate agriculture export subsidies, lower 
border tariffs on farm products which currently average about 50 
percent worldwide, and gain assurances that rules on new crops 
developed through biotechnology are based on sound science. 
</P>
<P>
	``In America, farmers are the lifeblood of our land,'' Clinton  
said. ``They help to fuel our unprecedented prosperity. 
Unfortunately, too few of our farmers are reaping the bounty they 
themselves have sown. ... One way we will revive the rural economy 
at home is by opening markets abroad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 15-nation EU, which accounts for 85 percent of world  
spending on farm subsidies, and other countries are fighting to 
keep barriers that protect their farmers against what they say are 
threats from U.S. agribusinesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan and South Korea also have protested the U.S. agriculture  
proposals during preliminary negotiations on the trade agenda at 
WTO headquarters in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said the United  
States has gained support from a number of other countries, 
including many developing nations put at a competitive disadvantage 
by the EU's huge subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents contend that the WTO, which began operating in 1995,  
has failed because it has not linked efforts to reduce trade 
barriers with protections for worker and the environment.

<HEADLINE> Compiled Evidence in JonBenet Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A look at some of the 30,000 items of evidence compiled in the  
JonBenet Ramsey slaying investigation, according to published 
reports and, in some cases, official statements. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Ransom note, demanding $118,000 for the safe return of  
JonBenet, which Patsy Ramsey said she found on a back staircase in 
the home. Experts have ruled out John Ramsey as the writer, but say 
results are inconclusive on whether it was written by Mrs. Ramsey. 
The paper it was written on came from a tablet in the Ramsey home, 
and lab tests concluded a Sharpie pen found in the home was used to 
write it. 
</P>
<P>
	-- No sign of forced entry into the home, but an apparent pry  
mark in the kitchen doorjamb. 
</P>
<P>
	-- White cord was wrapped around JonBenet's neck and wrist and  
tied to a stick. Duct tape that Ramsey said he found across his 
daughter's mouth. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Colorado Bureau of Investigation concluded four fibers  
found on the duct tape that had allegedly covered JonBenet's mouth 
were consistent with the jacket Mrs. Ramsey wore Christmas night, 
according to published reports. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Trace of DNA material that was unidentified was found in  
JonBenet's underwear and skin was found under her fingernails. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Unidentified palm print found on the door to the wine cellar.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Unidentified pubic hair found on blanket in which body was  
wrapped. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Police conducted sound tests to determine if neighbors could  
have heard a scream from the basement of the Ramsey home. A 
neighbor reported hearing a scream the night JonBenet died. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Remnants of a paintbrush fashioned into a garrote used to  
choke JonBenet were recovered just outside the boiler room. It was 
linked to Mrs. Ramsey's art supply kit. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Ramsey telephoned his pilot to prepare for a departure within  
hours of the discovery of JonBenet's body. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Ramseys and family friends roamed the house for several  
hours before JonBenet's body was found. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Broken basement window, but no footprints in the snow outside  
the house. 
</P>
<P>
	-- ``Mind Hunter,'' a book by former FBI criminal profiler John  
Douglas, was found in Ramseys' bedroom. It details a case that is 
similar to the Ramsey slaying, including the use of duct tape and 
ligatures and language used in the ransom note. 
</P>
<P>
	-- 911 tape had Burke's voice in background. The Ramseys  
initially told police he was asleep when they called. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Duct tape. Autopsy found no sign of skin damage around the  
girl's mouth, though ripping tape off would normally cause skin 
marks.

<HEADLINE> Herbs May Be Harmful Before Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Some popular herbal remedies -- including gingko  
biloba, ginseng and St. John's wort -- may prove dangerous if taken 
before surgery, according to doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers believe some of the most common herbal products  
might prolong the sedative effect of anesthesia, increase bleeding 
during surgery and cause fluctuations in blood pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	Patients should tell their surgeons about all herbal products  
they use, along with prescriptions and over-the-counter remedies, 
to avoid dangerous interactions, said Dr. Charles McLeskey, an 
anesthesiologist at Scott &AMP; White Memorial Hospital in Temple. 
</P>
<P>
	At a conference this week in Dallas of the American Society of  
Anesthesiologists, McLeskey presented results of a survey of 979 
presurgical patients. Seventeen percent said they take one of more 
herbal products. 
</P>
<P>
	The most common herbs listed were gingko biloba, garlic, ginger  
and ginseng -- all of which may prevent blood clots from forming and 
lead to excess blood loss in surgery. Two other popular herbs -- St. 
John's wort, an antidepressant, and kava-kava, a relaxant -- may 
prolong the sedative effect of anesthesia, McLeskey said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ASA suggests that patients stop taking herbal products at  
least two weeks before elective surgery and keep their doctors 
informed. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for the Council for Responsible Nutrition, which  
represents makers of dietary supplements, said patients should try 
to bring the bottles with them anytime they visit a doctor or 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime they are taking a dietary supplement they should  
mention that to their doctor,'' Cathy Fomus said. ``They can 
interact with food, with each other and other prescription drugs.''

<HEADLINE> BT, Microsoft Plan Handheld Devices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- British Telecommunications PLC and Microsoft Corp.  
will jointly develop technologies to enable people to use handheld 
wireless devices for sending e-mail and browsing the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The project announced Thursday, aimed at individual consumers,  
builds on a partnership the companies formed in February to provide 
wireless Internet services to large corporate customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies did not say how much money they would invest in  
the joint research. BT spokesman Simon Craven said the British 
company planned to devote ``substantial resources'' to the project, 
which is expected to last several years. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan represents a new stage in the partnership between the  
world's dominant maker of computer software and Britain's biggest 
telecommunications company. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, BT and Microsoft announced customer trials  
of corporate mobile Internet services in Britain and Norway. 
</P>
<P>
	The Microsoft-BT partnership provides British Telecom with the  
Internet technology to become a full-service provider of data and 
video services, a key part of its $10 billion planned alliance with 
AT&AMP;T Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft is trying to head off competition from Symbian, a  
rival wireless consortium formed by Motorola Inc., Nokia Corp. of 
Finland and Ericsson AB of Sweden that uses a rival operating 
system from Psion PLC of Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	The new project will focus on developing mobile Internet  
products based on the Microsoft CE operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	The first products and services from the new agreement are  
expected to become commercially available next year.

<HEADLINE> S.C. Court Bans Video Gambling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- South Carolina's Supreme Court may have  
finally broken the state's $2.8 billion-a-year video gambling habit 
Thursday after years of dithering in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
	The court disallowed a Nov. 2 referendum on the future of video  
gambling, ruling that the Legislature unconstitutionally delegated 
its lawmaking powers to the voters. But the court upheld the part 
of the referendum law that bans the games come July 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hallelujah! Video poker is dead in South Carolina,'' said  
House Speaker David Wilkins. ``I think the Supreme Court has 
resolved this once and for all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Video gambling operators said they will try to persuade  
lawmakers to rework the law and resurrect the referendum. But 
legislators and Gov. Jim Hodges said the issue is dead and the ban 
will stand. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to happen. The votes are not there,'' said  
Hodges, who has said he would vote to ban the games. 
</P>
<P>
	The games that former Gov. David Beasley once branded the  
``crack cocaine of gambling'' became legal without any debate in 
1986, when a little-noticed amendment was stuck into a budget bill. 
Video gambling spread across the state like the South's everpresent 
kudzu, and by last year there were at least 33,000 machines. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, 24-hour virtual casinos with neon lights, dozens of games  
and video blackjack and video craps games greet visitors at most 
larger towns along state borders. Convenience stores, bars, even 
coin-operated laundries have a couple of machines tucked away in a 
corner. 
</P>
<P>
	But critics warned of the dark side of life savings lost and  
families split up. In one case, a 10-day-old baby died in a 
sweltering car while her mother played video poker. The 28-year-old 
woman got five years' probation. 
</P>
<P>
	After years of legislative debate, lawsuits and a 1994  
county-by-county referendum that was voided by the courts, 
lawmakers finally decided to leave the question up to the voters 
and scheduled a statewide referendum. 
</P>
<P>
	In a campaign of dueling TV and radio ads, gambling operators  
warned that defeat of their business would throw thousands of 
people out of work, shut down mom-and-pop bars and convenience 
stores, and deprive the state of up to $200 million in tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Religious and business leaders came together to oppose the  
industry, however, and in a late-summer telephone poll for six 
South Carolina newspapers, 61 percent of those questioned said they 
would vote to ban the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Gunn, a lobbyist for video gambling casino operators,  
said the industry will wage a ``legislative dogfight'' to put the 
referendum back on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Tim Wilkes, a video gambling supporter, said: ``Do you  
really think that the Legislature really wants to go back and visit 
such a contentious issue in an election year?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the industry helped defeat Beasley's re-election bid  
after he tried to outlaw the games. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, in another setback for gambling in the South,  
members of the clergy in Alabama helped defeat Gov. Don Siegelman's 
proposal for a state lottery whose proceeds would have gone toward 
schools and college scholarships.

<HEADLINE> Many Decline Diet Drug Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Thousands of people suing American Home  
Products Corp. for injuries they say were caused by the fen-phen 
diet drug combination won't participate in a proposed $3.75 billion 
settlement, plaintiffs' attorneys say. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, the resolution of one of the largest  
product-liability cases remains in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home, based in Madison, N.J., announced a nationwide  
deal last week to settle claims that the drug combination caused 
dangerous heart valve problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, attorneys representing more than 8,000 plaintiffs  
have said their clients believe they can get more money by pursuing 
individual lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the lawyers complained the deal won't even reimburse  
clients for medical bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Marc J. Bern, whose New York City law firm represents 5,000  
plaintiffs, said the agreement was fine for healthy people who only 
sought payment for medical checkups in the future 
</P>
<P>
	``For those people who are injured, it stinks,'' Bern said.  
</P>
<P>
	American Home can terminate the deal in the next six months if  
it decides too many people refuse to participate, but the company 
won't say how many that would be. 
</P>
<P>
	The company says it has been sued by 11,000 fen-phen users, but  
some attorneys believe the number is considerably higher. In 
addition, attorneys say they have thousands of clients who have yet 
to sue. The settlement covers any of the 6 million people who took 
the drugs, whether they've sued or not. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home made fenfluramine -- the ``fen'' in fen-phen. It  
sold that drug under the brand name Pondimin, along with a similar 
drug called Redux. The two drugs were recalled in 1997 after they 
were linked to heart and lung damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Phentermine, the other half of the fen-phen mix, hasn't been  
linked to problems when taken alone. It is made by another company 
and is still on the market 
</P>
<P>
	American Home spokesman Doug Petkus wouldn't say if the loss of  
more than 8,000 plaintiffs would force the company to terminate the 
settlement. He said the deal offered a wide range of benefits to 
everyone who took the drugs and expected people to conclude it was 
preferable to a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``This agreement was designed for the patients, not the  
lawyers,'' Petkus said. ``We believe that well-informed claimants 
will participate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Payments in the settlement would range from $30 to $60 monthly  
prescription refunds to a maximum of $1.5 million for people with 
heart problems. 
</P>
<P>
	But a copy of the settlement agreement obtained by The  
Associated Press limits that maximum payment only to people who 
were 24 or younger when they became ill and who suffer the most 
serious complications from heart valve damage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if there is an individual in the United States  
that would qualify for $1.5 million under this settlement,'' said 
plaintiffs' attorney Bern. 
</P>
<P>
	He said many of his clients were middle-aged women whose medical  
expenses alone were higher than the maximum they could obtain under 
the settlement. He said none of his clients would participate. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston lawyer Tom Pirtle, who represents 3,200 plaintiffs, said  
one of his clients scheduled for trial in January has $2 million in 
medical bills, but would qualify for half that in the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	He has 40 other cases scheduled for trial, and said he could win  
damages more efficiently in the courts than he could from a 
settlement that may take years to win court approval. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've got a proposal,'' Pirtle said. ``I've got a person  
who's set for trial in January, who's not in good health.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bern said that lawyers appointed by a Philadelphia federal judge  
to negotiate a settlement primarily represented less ill clients. 
</P>
<P>
	Bern said he had talked to lawyers around the nation and said  
that at most, 25 percent of the plaintiffs' lawyers supported the 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	A plaintiffs' lawyer who helped negotiate the settlement,  
however, said he had the support of 100 lawyers who have filed more 
than half of the lawsuits against American Home. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been through this before,'' said Philadelphia lawyer  
Arnold Levin. ``I hear all these initial comments in the beginning 
and somehow, when a settlement is good, it takes.''

<HEADLINE> Japan Upgrades Economy's Assessment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan is mounting a ``modest'' recovery from its  
worst recession in decades, but weak corporate spending and high 
unemployment are still hindering the economy, the government said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a closely watched monthly report, the Economic Planning  
Agency said industrial production is rebounding, residential 
investment is improving and corporate profits are ``rallying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, the agency lifted its overall assessment the report  
for October, saying the pace of recovery is now ``modest,'' up from 
``slight.'' Government stimulus policies over the last year were 
partly behind the improvement, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	The optimism, however, was offset by a downgrade in the  
assessment of private consumption, considered a key element to 
economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan is struggling to rebound from its deepest economic  
downturn in 50 years. Recently, however, some bright signs have 
appeared, most notably two straight quarters of economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	On the down side, EPA official Takashi Omori said that although  
consumer spending had been moderately improving, it is now only 
``treading water'' due to sluggish personal incomes. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA's August household spending data showed average  
expenditures rose just 0.1 percent compared to the year-earlier 
period. Wage earners' spending contracted 1.1 percent on year in 
August, while real incomes slumped 3.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	A high jobless rate also continues to weigh on spending.  
Although the unemployment rate for August fell to 4.7 percent from 
4.9 percent in July, the EPA said it is too early to call the 
contraction a trend. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been cases in the past when unemployment has  
lessened only to worsen again in the next month,'' Omori said. 
</P>
<P>
	Capital spending by private companies, another key component, is  
still falling even though business sentiment and profits are 
improving somewhat, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	On a more positive note, the agency said industrial production  
is now recovering after output grew 4.6 percent in August compared 
to the month earlier, thanks to growing exports to Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	Housing starts are also continuing to improve, bolstered by a  
16.7 percent jump on year in the number of condominium starts in 
August, Omori said. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the Bank of Japan on Friday left its assessment of  
the economy unchanged in its monthly report, saying that the 
economy has stopped worsening, 
</P>
<P>
	``Japan's economy has stopped deteriorating, and exports and  
production are improving at present,'' the central bank said. 
</P>
<P>
	It added, however, that there were no clear signs of a firm  
recovery in private demand.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stocks Fall / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks fell Friday morning on worries over  
New York share prices after comments by the head of the U.S. 
central bank. The dollar was lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 137.39  
points, or 0.77 percent, to 17,642.87 at the end of morning 
trading. The index closed up 25.77 points, or 0.15 percent 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar traded at 106.86 yen, down 0.41 yen from its level of  
107.27 yen late Thursday in Tokyo and also below 107.35 yen late 
Thursday in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech to bankers, U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan  
Greenspan late Thursday warned that the decline in equity premiums 
that have kept U.S. stock prices rising in recent years could be 
temporary. 
</P>
<P>
	The equity premium is the difference between the returns yielded  
by stocks and the returns yielded by U.S. Treasury bonds. It 
effectively reflects the reward investors demand in return for 
taking on various risks. 
</P>
<P>
	In the speech, Greenspan waded indirectly into a debate over how  
long U.S. stock prices can keep rising, although he offered no firm 
conclusions of his own. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo stocks, often sensitive to developments that could affect  
market sentiment in the United States, moved lower and also got 
little support from a government report that slightly upgraded the 
assessment of Japan's economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The country is mounting a ``modest'' recovery from its worst  
downturn in decades, but weak corporate spending and high 
unemployment are still hindering the economy, the Economic Planning 
Agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo stock price index of all issues listed on the  
first section fell 12.89 points, or 0.84 percent, to 1,523.85. The 
TOPIX closed up 9.78 points, or 0.64 percent Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average closed up 54.45  
points Thursday at 10,286.61. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, dealers sold the dollar after Greenspan's  
comments. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was trading at 115.68 yen Friday  
morning, above its level of 115.60 yen late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose  
to 1.8150 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.7900 percent. Its 
price fell 0.21 point to 99.01.

<HEADLINE> Intel To Buy Wireless Chipmaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Intel Corp. is paying $1.6 billion to buy DSP  
Communications Inc., a maker of microprocessors for mobile phones, 
in a bid to extend its dominance in computer chips to the coming 
boom in wireless devices with Internet access. 
</P>
<P>
	DSP supplies integrated circuits and related system software for  
mobile phone manufacturers based on the wireless technology called 
digital signal processing. 
</P>
<P>
	Its customers include Lucent Technologies, Motorola, NEC, Denso,  
Kyocera, and Sanyo. The company is based in Cupertino, Calif., 
though most of its operations are located in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	For Intel, the deal adds a key technology that's at the very  
heart of the latest rage in the technology and telecommunications 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
	While beepers and other wireless devices with online services  
and e-mail are already available, untethered Internet access has 
emerged as an especially hot theme since the introduction last 
month of Web phone service by Sprint PCS. 
</P>
<P>
	This week's Telecom 99 trade show in Switzerland has been  
largely a frantic dash to unveil new capabilities for the first 
wave of wireless Internet phones, as well as future devices based 
on the next generation of wireless technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, the leading manufacturer of semiconductors for personal  
computers has been moving aggressively to make sure it plays a 
similar role in the development of network and wireless technology, 
areas with far more growth potential than desktop machines. 
</P>
<P>
	So while Intel already makes memory chips for cell phones that  
process and store data such as phone numbers and messages, DSP will 
enable it to also produce the chips that transmit that data between 
a mobile handset and a wireless network. 
</P>
<P>
	``This acquisition is an important element of Intel's plan to  
become the leading building block supplier to the Internet,'' the 
company said in a press release. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig Barrett, president and chief executive of the Santa Clara,  
Calif.-based Intel, added that, ``Cellular technology is emerging 
as a new high-speed method of connecting to the Internet and we 
believe over time will become increasingly important for connecting 
PCs to the Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The all-cash deal announced Thursday values DSP at $36 a share,  
or a premium of more than 25 percent above Wednesday's closing 
stock price of $28 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	DSP shares rose $6.31 1/4 to $34.93 3/4 in trading on the New York  
Stock Exchange. Intel shares rose $1.21 7/8 to $73.34 3/8 in trading on 
the Nasdaq Stock Market.

<HEADLINE> Relics of Iraqi Queen On Display </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some experts doubt the authenticity of the  
house in the ancient ruined city of Ur, sometimes called the 
birthplace of the patriarch Abraham, that Pope John Paul II wants 
to see next year on a pilgrimage to Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	But there's not much question about little Queen Puabi, who died  
there some 600 years before Abraham's time. Her great gold 
headdress goes on view Sunday at the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery of 
the Smithsonian Institution. The spray of seven gold flowers on the 
comb in the headdress must have added almost a foot to her height, 
which was just under five feet. 
</P>
<P>
	A personal seal with her name and title were found near her  
remains, along with those of 21 attendants -- including 10 women 
with musical instruments -- who were killed or who killed themselves 
to accompany her. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the sound of my sacred song they are ready to die,'' said a  
hymn of the period composed by a high priestess of Nanna, the chief 
god of Ur. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the tradition about Abraham and the story of Queen Puabi  
owe much to one British archaeologist, C. Leonard Woolley, who 
worked the site for 13 years through 1934. Little has been explored 
since then at Ur, one of antiquity's great cities, which draws just 
about 30 tourists a month. 
</P>
<P>
	``While he was speaking I felt in my mind no doubt whatever that  
the house on the corner had been Abraham's,'' mystery novelist 
Agatha Christie wrote in her autobiography. ``It was his 
reconstruction of the past and he believed in it, and anyone who 
listened to him believed in it also.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She married one of Woolley's assistants.  
</P>
<P>
	Woolley maintained that Abram -- Abraham's name before he  
emigrated from what is now Iraq to what is now Israel -- came from 
the city he was excavating. 
</P>
<P>
	Erle Leichty is professor of Assyriology at the University of  
Pennsylvania, where the museum owns the treasures of the present 
show. He doubts that Woolley ever found a clay tablet engraved 
``Abram,'' as is widely believed, and thinks Abraham originated in 
a different city -- there were several called Ur. 
</P>
<P>
	Others say that even such a tablet would have little meaning.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is not enough proof,'' said Behnan Abu al-Soof, Iraq's  
leading archaeologist. ``Abram was a common name in the context of 
the Near East in those days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woolley found Puabi's tomb, considered one of archaeology's  
greatest triumphs, rivaling the discovery of King Tutankhamen's in 
Egypt. Unlike many royal tombs, neither had been plundered and both 
contained a wealth of jewels, gold, vessels, statuary and musical 
instruments. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Pope John Paul II wants to include Ur on a pilgrimage he is  
planning for next year. That has raised doubts of another kind 
among diplomats in Washington and London. They fear a papal visit 
would strengthen Saddam Hussein, whose government has been pleased 
by the pope's criticism of sanctions against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've made clear to the Vatican our views on Saddam Hussein  
and his regime and its likely efforts to manipulate the pope for 
their political aims,'' said Philip Reeker, a State Department 
spokesman, ``and we hope this view will be taken into account in 
planning for any pilgrimage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rabi al-Qeisi, head of Iraq's Antiquities Department, says  
Saddam has allocated $500,000 to spruce up the area. The house is 
now a pile of mud and rubble. 
</P>
<P>
	There are military installations around the area, including one  
of Saddam's biggest air bases. Visitors are sometimes barred from 
climbing the 86-foot ziggurat, the remains of the ancient temple 
tower that is Ur's most prominent feature. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the ziggurat, but like Puabi's tomb, the Sackler Gallery  
is mostly underground, air conditioned and well lighted. Admission 
is free. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	After ``Treasures from the Royal Tombs of Ur'' closes at the  
Sackler Gallery Jan. 17, it travels to the Cleveland Museum of Art, 
Feb. 22-April 23; the Pierpont Morgan Library, New York, 
May-September; the Oriental Museum, Chicago, October 2000-January 
2001 and the Detroit Institute of Arts, February-May 2001.

<HEADLINE> Forest Service Explains Injuction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BENTON, Ill. (AP) -- A federal injunction that stopped certain  
logging projects in national forests has so far affected less than 
1 percent of the annual wood harvest from those forests, the 
government said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ultimate impact of the injunction still remains unclear. The  
U.S. Forest Service has yet to calculate the amount of timber 
awaiting sale subject to the injunction, spokesman Pete Pierce said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The injunction filed Sept. 28 affects timber sales under what is  
known as a ``categorical exclusion.'' The exclusion is used by the 
Forest Service to allow timber companies to log up to 250,000 
board-feet of live timber or up to 1 million board-feet of dead 
timber without the agency first completing various environmental 
impact assessments. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists had argued the Forest Service was using the  
program to skirt costly and time-consuming environmental reviews. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Forest Service, work has stopped on 141  
projects because of the injunction. Those projects stand to produce 
about 26 million board feet of timber, or enough to build about 
1,733 homes. 
</P>
<P>
	About 3.3 billion board feet of timber are harvested from  
national forests each year -- enough to build about 220,000 houses, 
according to the Forest Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Bensman, one of two environmentalists whose lawsuit led to  
the court order, said he expects the amount of logging that will be 
delayed by the injunction will be much larger than the agency 
estimate.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Drug Head: Operation Snagged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A request for information from a House  
subcommittee cost the White House's drug policy office $10,000 and 
brought its operations to a near halt for the last two weeks, the 
head of the office said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	An angry Barry McCaffrey, President Clinton's chief adviser on  
drug control policy, told the panel he was offended at the 
suggestion that his office had not been responsive to requests for 
details about its $185 million media campaign, including television 
and radio announcements, to persuade teen-agers to stay away from 
illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is enormously important to me personally that I be viewed  
as responsive to Congress in general and to this subcommittee,'' 
McCaffrey told the House Government Reform Committee's panel on 
criminal justice, drug policy and human resources. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have provided your office with more 12,000 documents. It  
cost me over $10,000 to do this. We have brought my agency to a 
halt for the better part of two weeks,'' McCaffrey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Subcommittee Chairman John Mica, R-Fla., said McCaffrey's office  
had done good work but it had delayed turning over requested 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based upon available information, there are signs of progress  
and there are also signs that raise doubts as to the media 
campaign's effectiveness and efficiency,'' Mica said. ``I now see a 
very tangled web of (media) contracts that appears overly 
complicated, expensive and untested.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans in Congress have long criticized the Clinton  
administration for what they believe would be a lax anti-drug 
policy without their influence. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey said anti-drug messages on television, radio, print  
and on the Internet are reaching 95 percent of 12- to 17-year-olds 
an average of 8.3 messages a week, some of them made by celebrities 
who have donated their time. 
</P>
<P>
	The messages have been translated into 11 languages, he said,  
and many are tailored to appeal to various ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are reaching nearly every single American child on a  
regular basis with anti-drug information,'' McCaffrey said. ``This 
campaign is working.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He asked the subcommittee to submit more focused requests for  
information and offered to meet personally with Mica to nail down 
precisely what information the subcommittee is seeking. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're just fishing -- looking for something,'' McCaffrey told  
reporters after testifying before the subcommittee. ``There is no 
lack of careful scientific evaluation of what we're doing.''

	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- NASCAR has fined car owner Kyle Petty  
and crew chief Jim Murray for rules violations found following 
second-round qualifying for last Saturday's All Pro Bumper to 
Bumper 300 Busch Series race at Lowe's Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	The car was disqualified after NASCAR technical inspectors found  
a groove had been cut into a rubber gasket to allow extra air to 
reach the carburetor of the Chevrolet driven by Adam Petty, Kyle's

<HEADLINE> Retail Sales Rise in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Retail sales rose just 0.1 percent in  
September as Americans pulled in their spending somewhat on cars 
and clothing from last month's buying frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
	Total retail sales rose last month to a seasonally adjusted  
$253.4 billion, the Commerce Department said today. That was 
slightly worse than the 0.2 percent increase many analysts were 
forecasting. 
</P>
<P>
	The September increase followed a revised 1.5 percent gain in  
August, better than the 1.2 percent the government previously 
estimated. 
</P>
<P>
	Retail sales have climbed or held steady most months of this  
year and were 10.5 percent higher than September of last year. 
</P>
<P>
	September's performance may be a sign that the Federal Reserve's  
two interest rate increases in June and August are beginning to 
slow consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of the total 
economy. The Fed has boosted short-term interest rates by one-half 
percentage point this summer and long-term rates, including 
mortgage rates, have risen even more this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the central bank said it wouldn't raise rates for  
now, but left open the possibility of a third rate increase later 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The consumer sector is being supported by the lowest  
unemployment rate in nearly three decades, a 4.2 percent level that 
has given more workers cash to spend. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report today, the Labor Department said that the  
number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits last week fell 
by an unexpected 29,000 to 285,000 as the jobs market bounced back 
after the effects of Hurricane Floyd. Economists believe that 
jobless claims levels under 300,000 are an indication of an 
extremely tight labor market. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall retail sales were held back by a 1.3 decline in sales of  
news cars and trucks at automobile dealerships in September. That 
followed a strong 3.1 percent increase the month before. Still, the 
auto industry is anticipating a record sales year in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding the volatile autos category, retail sales rose a brisk  
0.6 percent in September. Many analysts were expecting a 0.5 
percent gain. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales at apparel and accessory stores were down in September,  
dropping 0.9 percent following a 1.2 percent gain the month before. 
</P>
<P>
	And, sales at hardware and building supply stores were down 0.6  
percent in September despite Hurricane Floyd, which raked the East 
Coast last month. That category, which also includes mobile home 
dealers, posted a 0.4 percent gain in August. 
</P>
<P>
	But there were bright spots in the report. Sales at furniture  
and home furnishing stores posted a solid 1.2 percent gain in 
September after 0.7 percent gain in August. 
</P>
<P>
	General merchandise stores, which includes department stores,  
rose 1.0 percent in September after a 0.5 percent gain in August, 
while sales at drug stores were up 1.0 percent and sales at bars 
and restaurants increased 0.6 percent. Sales at grocery stores also 
rose 0.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest gain in September came from sales at gasoline  
stations, which were up 2.4 percent reflecting rising energy 
prices. That followed a 2.7 percent rise in August. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's biggest retailers last week reported that sales  
rose modestly in September as the robust U.S. economy continued to 
encourage shoppers to spend despite volatility in the stock market, 
rising interest rates and the hurricane.

<HEADLINE> FCC Defends Rules on Disabled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's top telephone regulator issued a  
stern warning Thursday to companies that might challenge new 
federal rules aimed at making telecommunications equipment and 
services easier for disabled people to use. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're prepared to defend our rules,'' said Federal  
Communications Commission Chairman Bill Kennard, bracing for 
possible industry challenges to the rules adopted in June. ``I know 
I won't stand alone in this fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The regulations require companies to make pagers, cellular  
phones and other devices and services accessible to people with 
disabilities. They don't dictate specific standards, but mandate 
that manufacturers and carriers incorporate changes into the design 
of their systems. 
</P>
<P>
	At a White House briefing on disabilities, Kennard cited  
numerous companies that have enthusiastically supported the rules 
that carry out provisions of a 1996 telecommunications law. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he said he also has heard ``rumblings'' that some  
companies might go to court to argue that the rules fall outside 
the commission's jurisdiction. Particularly, they may dispute 
portions of the regulations aimed at making voicemail and 
interactive menu services easier for disabled people to use, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC officials say such services -- such as the sequence of menus  
callers get when they dial for information about flight status or 
to reach a particular person in a company -- can pose special 
challenges to those who use ``text telephones,'' usually referred 
to as TTY or TDD systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard did not identify which groups or companies might seek to  
have the rules overturned, but promised that the FCC would fight 
such efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will use all of the resources at the FCC to defend our rules  
and to convince the courts that what we have done is lawful and 
reasonable and right,'' Kennard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the rules, equipment such as voice-activated phones,  
talking Caller ID and phones with keypads with large buttons or 
identifying bumps on the ``5'' key would be more commonplace. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard said the FCC also is looking ahead to ensure the next  
generation of services -- such as the ability to make calls over the 
Internet -- are also accessible to those with disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to be ahead of the curve,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Breast Cancer Resolution Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal government, hoping to help  
uninsured women detect breast and cervical cancer early, pays for 
tests that diagnose the diseases. But once a woman finds out she 
has cancer, the government help ends. 
</P>
<P>
	Pending legislation in the House would help these women, about  
3,600 each year, who are too wealthy for Medicaid, too young for 
Medicare but have no private insurance. It would allow Medicaid to 
pay for treatments. 
</P>
<P>
	With a strong push from women's groups, the measure quickly  
gathered more than 270 co-sponsors, with support from both 
Democrats and Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	But now it's stuck in the House Commerce Committee, which on  
Wednesday approved a resolution expressing the House's support for 
education, early detection and treatment of breast cancer. The 
payment bill was not acted on, prompting complaints from Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't the Make A Wish Foundation. This is the Congress of  
the United States,'' said Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-Calif., who is 
sponsoring the bill with Republican Rep. Rick Lazio of New York. 
``Once someone is screened and they come up positive with cervical 
or breast cancer, should we be telling them they're on their own?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is being held up to address concerns of Rep. Tom  
Coburn, R-Okla., who wants to address a common sexually transmitted 
disease called human papillomavirus, usually known as HPV. Some 
strains of HPV can lead to cervical cancer, and nearly all women 
who contract cervical cancer had HPV first. 
</P>
<P>
	``To ignore prevention for the name of treatment is  
ill-conceived,'' Coburn said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Coburn, an obstetrian, has asked that the bill be amended to  
require the Centers for Disease Control to monitor HPV infections 
and to require that condom manufacturers put warnings on condoms 
that they do not prevent transmission of HPV. 
</P>
<P>
	Eshoo said Wednesday that she was working with Coburn on the CDC  
reporting and believed that he had dropped his concerns about 
condom labels. But Coburn said today ``there's no way'' he will 
stop pushing for the labels. 
</P>
<P>
	``Women don't need to get cervical cancer anymore. We can stop  
it. But we can't stop it if we put our head in the sand,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that because there virtually is no way to stop the  
transmission of HPV during sex, government officials have not 
warned against it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not politically correct,'' he said. ``It's not proper to  
say you shouldn't have intercourse outside of marriage, even though 
it's the only thing that's going to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he said these concerns can be worked out. And Commerce  
Committee Chairman Thomas Bliley, R-Va., said Wednesday that he 
would move the bill this year, though advocates worry that time is 
running out. They also fear some members of Congress might conclude 
that the resolution on breast cancer was good enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``Members of the committee could say they were doing something  
for breast cancer,'' said Fran Visco of Philadelphia, president of 
the National Breast Cancer Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
	But she said it won't work: ``We know the value of a resolution  
as opposed a piece of legislation that will get them treatment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The treatment bill would allow federal Medicaid money to treat  
women who through the screening program and are diagnosed with 
breast or cervical cancer. States, which pay part of the cost of 
Medicaid, would get a larger share of federal funding for this 
treatment if they chose to participate. 
</P>
<P>
	It's expected to cost the federal government $315 million over  
five years.

<HEADLINE> NYC Tourists Telling Tall Tales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) --Police are seeing a spate of false reports from  
foreign tourists claiming they were mugged in the big city, and 
many of them are telling some pretty tall tales. 
</P>
<P>
	The phony victims ``give us a Hollywood version,'' says Capt.  
James P. O'Neill, commander of the Central Park precinct. 
``Something corny, like the perp said, `Stick 'em up.' Nobody says 
that anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tourists are apparently trying to get some money from their  
insurance companies back home. 
</P>
<P>
	Many are under the impression that Central Park is akin to the  
Wild West. Police say at least 10 tourists have filed false mugging 
reports this year in Central Park; six New Yorkers also got caught. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them, according to police: an Australian couple who  
falsely claimed this week that their camera had been stolen; a man 
from England who reported over the summer that he was robbed of 
thousands in cash; and a man from Tokyo who claimed the theft of a 
duffel bag filled with thousands of dollars worth of camera 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	``We arrested a man from Wales in March and he said it was a  
well-known fact in Wales that you can report a robbery in Central 
Park and no one would question you because so many robberies happen 
here,'' O'Neill says. 
</P>
<P>
	Wrong on both counts.  
</P>
<P>
	Crime is down 30 percent this year in the park. As of Oct. 10,  
there were 53 robberies there, mostly of jewelry, bicycles and 
cash, compared with 66 during the same time last year. The Central 
Park Conservancy says 20 million people visit the park every year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes, the stories told by the tourists take on Indiana  
Jones proportions. A few favorites around the precinct: 
</P>
<P>
	--The armed-to-the-teeth tale: ``One guy from England said he was  
robbed by three men, and one guy had a knife in his belt, up his 
arm and up another sleeve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--The ``robbers on Rollerblades ruse,'' involving two purported  
victims and three scofflaw skaters. 
</P>
<P>
	--The ``robbed in broad daylight surrounded by hundreds of  
people'' scenario. (This one really had cops rolling their eyes.)
