EDITORIAL: THE RECEDING INFLUENCE OF EMPIRES 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Dec. 22:
</P>
<P>
   For all the strife at the dawn of a new millennium, one enduring
source of conflict may be receding. At least for now, the earth's
empires have disappeared as anchors of international order. Some
fear that a suffocating American imperium now enforces its culture
and unforgiving economic rules. But in today's global environment,
the cost and complexity of one people trying to control the
sovereignty of broad stretches of the globe no longer seem worth
bearing. Today's challenge is to make the new system of established
states, new states, failed states, would-be states, regional
conflicts and tenuous alliances work better than the old.
</P>
<P>
   The 20th century has seen three waves of collapsing empires, as
the political scientist Michael Mandelbaum points out. First came
the great dynasties of the Hapsburgs, Hohenzollerns, Ottomans and
Romanovs _ destroying each other in the calamity of World War I,
followed by the demise of the British, French, Dutch and Japanese
empires at the end of World War II and the disintegration of the
Soviet empire a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   The current epoch began not only with the birth of the Christian
era, but also the legacy of Rome. As the historian William McNeill
notes in ``The Rise of the West,'' the moment of Jesus' life
coincided with a profound demographic change in human history, as
``the submerged peoples and rootless populations'' who had migrated
to the urban centers of the Roman Empire, as well as the Parthian,
Kushan and Han empires to the east, struggled for spiritual
guidance. The spread of Christianity, Buddhism and Hinduism among
these peoples helped answer their needs.
</P>
<P>
   For 2,000 years, Rome has given its identity to the West's
political establishments. In Europe, Charlemagne and many
subsequent rulers chose for their domain the legitimizing name of
Holy Roman Empire. The Roman republic served as a model for the
revolutionaries in France and North America, where a nation was
established in 1776, the year of the publication of Edward Gibbon's
``History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.'' Gibbon
observed that barbarism and religion had destroyed an empire that
at its height offered a realm in which ``the human race was most
happy and prosperous.''
</P>
<P>
   In the book ``Empires,'' the Princeton historian Michael Doyle
suggests that empires today are dying from the spread of
nationalism, liberal democracy, global capitalism and the ease with
which the peoples of the world can subvert their subjugators. No
one can know whether empires will rise again, in part because
smaller nations may find it useful to ally themselves with larger
ones. But for now, Doyle suggests, the cost of imperialism has
risen to an unacceptable level.
</P>
<P>
   Yet much of Asia, Africa and Latin America remain organized
along boundaries designed by their onetime imperial overlords.
Immense countries like Indonesia and India are residual imperial
states, China rules coercively over its varied and restless
peoples, and even the subgroups within Britain and France seem
increasingly eager to assert their identities. The beginning of the
next millennium offers the challenge of inventing a new order to
replace the artificial, often brutal stability imposed by old
imperial structures. Without a new respect for the rights of
minorities, the world's thousands of ethnic, linguistic and
religious subgroups will increasingly wonder whether their moment
to press for independence as a nation has arrived.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of this century, Woodrow Wilson proposed the
concept of self-determination as the new organizing principle of
the world after the end of the era of empires. But his secretary of
state, Robert Lansing, wondered from the start whether
self-determination would create more problems than it would solve.
``The phrase is simply loaded with dynamite,'' he wrote in his
diaries. ``It will raise hopes which can never be realized. It
will, I fear, cost thousands of lives.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the millennium, the world has a much better idea
of what it is leaving behind than of what lies ahead. Yet surely
the challenge of the future is to preserve Wilson's vision while
avoiding atomization of the world into ever tinier nations. If
there is a new world order, its stability will only come by a
revitalization of each nation's identity, with or without new
boundaries drawn on a map. A new philosophy of respect for the
world's variety needs to replace the imperial designs that lasted
for more than 2,000 years. &QL;

INCENTIVES COULD RAISE SOME SCHOOL PRINCIPALS' PAY BY 70 PERCENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If New York City school principals approve the pay
package recently negotiated by their union, some stand to increase
their pay by 70 percent and could possibly earn more than $143,000
a year beginning in April.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the contract calls for across-the-board raises of 33
percent for principals who have been without a contract for four
years. But bonuses and incentives in the new contract could
substantially raise many principals' compensation well beyond 33
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The largest gains are likely to go to only a small contingent _
principals with the most years of service and those who are willing
to work in large or underperforming schools, or those leading such
schools who perform in the top ranks among principals across the
city. Principals working in underperforming schools would qualify
for extra pay of $10,000, and those ranking in the top 5 percent
among all city principals would earn an extra $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the longest-serving principals will be willing to move
into the most challenging positions is open to question, as is
whether principals at low-performing schools can quickly turn in
top-ranked performances.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new contract's terms, the highest paid principals, who
now earn $83,921, could earn more than $143,000, an increase of 70
percent, through the base pay raise and incentive bonuses. And
lower-paid principals, whose salaries start at $69,599, could see
their earnings rise sharply if they agree to move to a
lower-performing school and subsequently earn increases based on
performance evaluations.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a high-school principal who now earns the average
salary of $79,347 would earn $105,661 under the negotiated
contract's base salary increase. If that principal worked at an
underperforming school, earning a $10,000 bonus, and earned a
$15,000 bonus for placing in the top 5 percent of all principals on
the basis of performance evaluations, the compensation would rise
to $130,661 _ a total gain of 65 percent.

BELTRE DENIED FREE AGENCY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Despite the Los Angeles Dodgers admitting to
falsifying Adrian Beltre's age and knowingly signing him at an
illegal age, baseball commissioner Bud Selig made an expected
announcement Tuesday, denying the Dodger third baseman's request to
be granted free agency.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers were fined $50,000, markedly less than the club
anticipated, and ordered to pay Beltre damages. But in announcing
his ruling, Selig said Beltre and/or his representatives likely
were aware at the time of the signing he was not of sufficient age.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is hardly settled, though. The players union is
gathering the final pieces of information and is expected to file a
grievance, possibly by the end of the week. The case will then be
brought in front of arbitrator Shyam Das, and the union is expected
to ask for the process to be expedited. Still, it's unlikely the
matter will be resolved before mid-January.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers must also close their Campo Las Palmas complex in
the Dominican Republic for one year and are forbidden from scouting
or signing any first-year player who resides in the Dominican
Republic for one year. The Dodgers are still allowed to field teams
in the Dominican Republic, but they can't play, train, or lodge at
the complex.
</P>
<P>
   If Das rules in favor of Beltre, the 20-year-old would become a
free agent. But the fines and sanctions levied against the Dodgers
would then become void, several sources said. But once the
grievance is filed those sanctions are tabled.
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball also suspended Ralph Avila and Pablo
Peguero, the scouts who allegedly orchestrated Beltre's signing,
for one year.
</P>
<P>
   Avila and Peguero were also implicated in the illegal scouting
and signing of a pair of Cuban defectors that were in the Dodgers
minor league system until this past summer. Baseball ruled Josue
Perez and Juan Carlos Diaz free agents and fined the Dodgers
$200,000. Diaz then received an $850,000 signing bonus with the
Philadelphia Philles.
</P>
<P>
   Avila is retired and no longer associated with the Dodgers.
Peguero runs Campo Las Palmas, but a Dodgers official said
Peguero's time with the club is ``extremely limited.'' Even if an
arbitrator overturns baseball's ruling, it doesn't affect the
suspensions of Peguero and Avila, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a serious violation of Major League Baseball's
rules,'' Selig said. ``There are those who would like to dismiss
this kind of behavior as `business as usual.' We will not allow
such an attitude to prevail in our game, and we will vigorously
enforce the rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although these violations occurred under prior ownership, the
club must accept responsibility for the consequences of the acts,
no matter when they were committed.''
</P>
<P>
   The six-week investigation was conducted by Sandy Alderson,
executive vice president of baseball operations for the office of
the commissioner. Alderson, however, wouldn't comment on the case.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers did not comment either, but the club issued a
statement from president and COO Bob Graziano.
</P>
<P>
   ``We submitted this matter to the commissioner, fully cooperated
in the investigation process and will abide by his findings and his
ruling,'' Graziano said. ``As we have said before, the Dodgers
respect and strongly endorse the rules and regulations of Major
League Baseball, and we fully intend to comply with those rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have and will continue to improve our structure and to
strengthen our policies so that similar issues will not arise in
the future. We remain committed to protecting and upholding the
integrity of the game and the honored tradition of the Los Angeles
Dodgers.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation concluded Beltre was 15 when he signed a
contract in 1994. Beltre received a $23,000 bonus. The Dodgers were
ordered to pay Beltre the difference between that figure and the
bonus he would have received had he signed at age 16, plus
interest. It works out to $49,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first step in the process,'' said Scott Boras, who
represents Beltre. ``Now, we can move forward and get the issue in
front of an arbitrator.''
</P>
<P>
   Once in front of the arbitrator, baseball is expected to base
its case on Beltre, and/or his representatives, having knowledge he
was signed illegally and he hid the issue until it benefited him
financially to come forward.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball's report said ``documents demonstrate Beltre's
awareness of the Dodgers' falsification of his birth date long
before the case was brought to the commissioner.'' It also said
Beltre used the falsified birth date.
</P>
<P>
   Boras, on behalf of Beltre, is expected to argue that Beltre had
no knowledge of the rule preventing a player from signing before
the age of 16. Boras said Beltre didn't know about the rule until
the two had a conversation March 10. Baseball rules state a claim
must be made within one year of when the violation was discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre is an integral part of the Dodgers, and is considered one
of the top prospects in baseball. In his first full season he hit
.275 with 15 homers, 67 RBI and 18 stolen bases. Beltre made
$220,000 last season.

 By JACQUES STEINBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The squeaky falsetto across the table was intimately
familiar, at least to anyone who has been a child or parent in the
last 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elmo loves sushi,'' he said, referring to himself in the third
person, as he always does. ``Especially wasabi. That's why Elmo
doesn't have eyelids. Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh!''
</P>
<P>
   But if the voice _ think Carol Channing on helium _ sounded as
if it was burbling from ``Rock and Roll Elmo,'' one of this
season's must-have toys, the body was all wrong: instead of two
ping-pong-ball eyes set atop a hank of ragged red fur, the speaker
was 6 feet tall and 195 pounds. Above his lips was a thin mustache
that was more Billy Dee Williams than Big Bird, and he was wearing
a cream-wool turtleneck that screamed Barneys, not Barney.
</P>
<P>
   To his interviewer, whose 18-month-old daughter thinks ``Elmo's
Song'' is the national anthem, the voice that came out next was
jarring. It was a baritone, one that can dip as low as Barry
White's bass, but, he says, is most comfortable closer to Joe
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think I must be a little, chubby, bald-headed guy with
glasses,'' said Kevin Clash, 39, who gives Elmo _ the ``Sesame
Street'' character and the toys _ his speech and his spirit, as
well as the motion in his paws and jaw. ``The bottom line is, no
one knows what a puppeteer is to begin with. And they're certainly
not going to think `black' first. It's not the norm.''
</P>
<P>
   A mouthful of lobster tempura and a swirl of merlot later, he
added: ``This is a very strange occupation.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so strange, perhaps, when you consider that Clash had been
dreaming of living on Sesame Street since age 9. The third of four
children, he grew up in Baltimore, where his father worked at a
steel factory. His mother ran a day care center out of the family's
two-bedroom home.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever there was a snowstorm, his parents would burrow a cave
through the neighborhood, crowning it with flags bearing names like
Fort McSnow. ``The Clashes were very silly people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clash's earliest memories are of turning garbage into stage
sets. ``I'd take a box and coat hangers and dolls and attach them
together, so the dolls would go up and down,'' he said. If he
wasn't watching ``Sesame Street'' _ trying to build Muppets like
those who have called the show home since 1969 _ Clash was buying
``fur, felt, eyes and noses.''
</P>
<P>
   As an adolescent, he would lure audiences to his puppet shows
with free candy. Soon, he was performing at fairs on the Inner
Harbor where he was discovered, in the 10th grade, by a local
weatherman, Stu Kerr.
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks, he and Kerr had their own children's television
show, ``Caboose,'' in which Clash performed characters like Bartee,
who wore Clash's grandmother's wig, and two skunks who sang ``You
and Me Against the World.''
</P>
<P>
   It was inevitable that Captain Kangaroo would call.
</P>
<P>
   Kerr had served in the military with Bob Keeshan, who played the
captain, and at Kerr's prodding, Keeshan's producers traveled to
Baltimore to raid Clash's shelves of puppets. He had not yet
graduated from high school.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after he did, in 1979, he was working full time on
``Captain Kangaroo'' in New York. At the same time, he was also
penetrating the Muppets' inner circle, through a budding friendship
with Kermit Love, who, though no relation to The Frog, was an
associate of Jim Henson's.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, after ending his run at ``Captain Kangaroo'' and
another show, ``The Great Space Coaster,'' Clash moved to Sesame
Street, which, it turns out, is in the Astoria section of Queens.
Struggling to find a character, Clash was relegated to playing
``miscellaneous pigs and chickens.'' That changed in 1985, when
Brian Meehl, the Muppeteer who originated Elmo, left the show after
playing him only three or four times.
</P>
<P>
   Elmo, a hand puppet who was barely defined beyond being a
3-year-old, was reassigned to Richard Hunt. But Hunt hated the
character immediately _ Elmo wasn't edgy enough _ and, on one
memorable morning, brought him into the Muppeteers' lounge
``hanging by the rods,'' the chopsticklike bars that control his
paws.
</P>
<P>
   ``He handed him to me like a piece of trash and said `Here, come
up with a voice,''' Clash recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Though Clash says that Elmo's BB-gun giggle erupted immediately,
it took a visit to his mother's day-care center to locate Elmo's
soul. ``What I got from those kids,'' he says, ``is that innocence
and sweetness and positiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   Though celebrity parents like Jamie Lee Curtis soon requested
guest appearances with Elmo, helping make him an international
star, Rosie O'Donnell certified him as a marketing juggernaut.
After she held up a ``Tickle Me Elmo'' doll on her show in 1996,
hundreds of thousands were sold.
</P>
<P>
   Clash, who owns no rights to the character, says he has been
well-compensated. But he says the richest payoffs often come off
the set.
</P>
<P>
   As Elmo, he has whispered in the ears of dying children, left
answering machine messages for strangers celebrating wedding
anniversaries and made his 6-year-old daughter, Shannon, the envy
of her friends.
</P>
<P>
   But the request that hit him hardest arrived in a letter from a
young girl, whose sick mother had clutched ``Tickle Me Elmo''
during rounds of chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had asked to be buried with Elmo,'' Clash says, his eyes
wet. ``And he went with her.''

PARTY TIME FOR THE MAORI  
 GORE-BRADLEY DEBATE DRAWS VIEWERS  
 NEW GAME SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Millennium mania _ or madness or mayhem, depending on events _
will be all over television the next two weeks, with the ultimate
confluence of coverage on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   A brief sampling of what is available ranges from the Time
magazine ``Person of the Century'' special on CBS on Monday at 10
p.m. (the magazine has gone to enormous lengths to try to keep the
selection secret) to the top 99 videos of 1999 on MTV starting at 9
a.m. on Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   The main focus, however, will be on the events of the turn of
the century itself, which has been designated the turn of the
millennium even though nitpickers and math majors are holding out
for 2001 as the real millennial event.
</P>
<P>
   ABC has been widely promoting its commitment to covering all
sorts of worldwide events as the clock changes around the world
that day. But that network will hardly be alone. All three cable
news channels will be devoting the day to both global millennial
celebrations and whatever Y2K-related disasters may occur.
</P>
<P>
   The other broadcast networks will have news crews in place for
the same reason, though they will mainly devote their prime-time
hours to entertainment-oriented celebrations, like a special David
Letterman show and the ``America's Millennium'' concert on the lawn
of the Capitol in Washington on CBS (complete with Will Smith as
host and a preview of a short film by Steven Spielberg, ``The
Unfinished Journey'') and live performances from artists like the
Red Hot Chili Peppers on Fox.
</P>
<P>
   NBC will have its news anchors Tom Brokaw and Katie Couric in
Times Square from 9 p.m. to 3 a.m. covering both whatever news
occurs and introducing such entertainment events as concerts by
Sting and Gloria Estefan and a special 15-minute monologue by Jay
Leno.
</P>
<P>
   Among the broadcasters, however, only PBS is going quite as all
out as ABC. In fact, because PBS belongs to the same special
millennial consortium as ABC, some of the coverage will be
duplicated.
</P>
<P>
   The ``PBS Millennium 2000'' special (beginning at 4:45 a.m. on
Dec. 31) will be a live 25-hour extravaganza with Gwen Ifill as
host. Like many of the other outlets covering live events, PBS will
have international high points, including shots of Maori warriors
dancing at dawn on their island off New Zealand, and Nelson Mandela
as the host for freedom celebrations in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Special PBS touches will include an acrobatic ballet from
Sydney, Australia, a performance of the musical ``Fosse,'' and a
millennium song from the Gipsy Kings in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   At least one veteran network news producer has questioned
whether the millennial New Year is truly worth all the fuss.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly some elements seem a bit contrived. Many of those
celebrating would seem to have little reason to mark a year made
significant only by the Christian calendar.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best example is the Maori tribesmen, who seem to
have gone to great lengths to seek out this once-in-a-millennium
photo opportunity. CNN's president, Rick Kaplan, said that the
Maori had petitioned officials at the Greenwich Institute in
England to move up their time zone by 15 minutes so they would
indeed be the very first civilization on the planet to mark the new
millennium. (They are receiving worldwide coverage for their
efforts.)
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the Dixville Notch of the millennium,'' Kaplan said,
referring to the small New Hampshire community that always gets its
presidential votes in first.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan argued that reaching the year 2000 was far too
significant a moment to go uncelebrated or unexamined. ``It is
really an extraordinary opportunity,'' he said. And CNN intends to
observe it not only with all-day coverage from around the globe on
Dec. 31, but also by an entire weekend of special programming
devoted to a look toward the future.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan said that CNN had contacted world experts on subjects
from genetics to computer science to the weather and found a
remarkable number of them not only available on that weekend but
also eager to discuss where the world is heading in their areas of
expertise.
</P>
<P>
   CNN will be offering everyone from Mikhail Gorbachev talking to
Shimon Peres about water use to Bill Gates talking to Larry King
about where technology is leading the world.
</P>
<P>
   Will there be interest? ``Not everybody will be watching bowl
games,'' Kaplan said.
</P>
<P>
   Debate Scores
</P>
<P>
   ``Meet the Press'' rode its newsmaking debate between Vice
President Al Gore and Bill Bradley to an enormous ratings edge over
the other Sunday- morning political discussion shows last week.
</P>
<P>
   The debate added about 700,000 more viewers than the show had
averaged in November. The initial national ratings for the
broadcast gave NBC's ``Meet the Press'' a 3.9 rating, over a 2.3
for ``Face the Nation'' on CBS, 2.2 for ``This Week'' on ABC and a
1.5 for ``News Sunday'' on Fox. (Each rating point represents just
over 1 million homes.)
</P>
<P>
   The results further underscored the decline of ABC's ``This
Week,'' which until two years ago had been the regular leader in
the Sunday competition. Not only was ``This Week'' beaten by ``Face
the Nation'' for the second time in recent weeks, it also saw its
move to the 9 a.m. hour in New York result in even worse ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday ABC finished fourth in New York, beaten by Fox's
show, which faces it head-to-head at 9 a.m. ``Meet the Press,''
which is broadcast at 10:30 in New York, won in that market by
about four full ratings points.
</P>
<P>
   More Games
</P>
<P>
   CBS announced this week that it was adding yet another game show
to the prime-time schedule starting on Jan. 8. The show, ``Winning
Lines,'' is another British import and another creation of Paul
Smith, the man behind `'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS is committed to producing six of the shows and will put it
into full production if it likes the early rating trend. Few shows
have had a quicker development cycle.
</P>
<P>
   CBS is reaching deep into its history for its host. Dick Clark,
who has been serving as a television host for more than a
generation, will again take up the role on the new CBS show. That
will make him a major player in the game show phenomenon. Clark is
a producer of the game ``Greed,'' for the Fox network.

EDUCATION CENTER THRIVES, AND PROFITS, IN A POOR LOCALE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.J., Md.)  (mk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Amid the pulsing rhythms that envelop Fulton Street
in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn on most afternoons _
street vendors hawking gloves and sweatshirts, music flowing from
the open doors of stores onto the sidewalks _ the sound of learning
can easily go unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   But it is there, tucked away in a second-floor corner of an
aging shopping plaza, in the Score Educational Center. Inside,
children raise their hands excitedly to ask questions or to point
out their completion of a lesson in math, spelling or reading. They
listen attentively through headphones connected to computers. Once
in a while, a student shoots a ball at a basketball hoop as a
reward for scoring at least 90 percent on a lesson.
</P>
<P>
   The center's interior, crammed with computers, posters of
athletes and snapshots of children's smiling faces, is little
different from the hundred or so other after-school centers run by
Score, a division of Kaplan Educational Centers, or from the dozens
of similar for-profit tutoring centers run by competitors like
Sylvan and Huntington in strip malls in well-to-do suburbs across
the country.
</P>
<P>
   What is unusual is the fact that a Score center even exists in
Bedford-Stuyvesant. It is one of the city's poorest neighborhoods,
and although schoolchildren there lag far behind academically,
their parents are generally less able to afford tutoring than
parents elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But Kaplan says the center is profitable because of a unique
arrangement: It is a joint venture with the nonprofit
Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corp., the country's oldest
community development group, which paid for improvements to the
office space in Restoration Plaza on Fulton Street and receives
half of the center's profits. The two groups see the center as a
model for similar neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   At $80 per month, tuition is 25 percent less than what Score
charges at most of its centers around the country and about half
the rate charged at some of its centers in Manhattan. For that sum,
students get two hourlong sessions a week, during which they
complete an increasingly challenging set of study assignments in
basic academic subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the lowered rates, Robert Waldron, chief executive of
Score, says he was far from certain how Bedford-Stuyvesant would
respond to the center. In an area of the city where the median
household income is $19,300 a year, the Score tuition accounts for
5 percent of the average family's monthly earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The weight of that expense is not lost on parents. ``People
sacrifice to bring their kids here,'' said Beverly Torbert, a
neighborhood resident whose four children have participated in the
Score program since it opened in Bedford-Stuyvesant in October
1998. ``But they are rushing to join. That means this is a
community that needs something like this.''
</P>
<P>
   On most afternoons and Saturdays, the center is overflowing.
``It's more successful than we imagined,'' Waldron said. ``We want
to build more like it. The fact that we've been able to earn a
profit on the center will allow us to spread the idea to other
communities.''
</P>
<P>
   The center has become profitable for Score _ nearly as
profitable as centers where the company charges higher tuition
rates, Waldron said _ because more than 450 students have signed
up, 50 percent more than at the average Score center. In fact,
Score has had to restrict membership, allowing new students to join
only when current students resign.
</P>
<P>
   That Score ended up in Bedford-Stuyvesant was a result of a
fortuitous meeting of the minds between the leaders of the
restoration corporation and Score. Roderick Mitchell, president of
Bedford-Stuyvesant development group, said the organization
recruited Score after a former board member talked about his
child's experience in a center near San Francisco, Score's home.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We were concerned that all of the Score locations were in
well-to-do communities,'' Mitchell said. ``But we were able to
convey that poor people and middle-class black people have as much
of a vested interest as anyone in making sure their kids are
prepared academically.''
</P>
<P>
   They found a willing listener in Waldron. After graduating from
Northwestern University, Waldron went to work on Wall Street in
Morgan Stanley's public finance unit, where his clients included
the New York City Board of Education. At the same time, he
volunteered at Covenant House, the shelter for homeless teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   Waldron's essay in application to Harvard Business School
focused on his desire to create and run a for-profit education
company. After graduation, he went to work for Kaplan, which bought
Score and put him in charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking to take a portion of what we do and try to give
something back to a community that needed it,'' Waldron said. ``To
the credit of Restoration, they said we don't want you to come here
unless you do it as a for-profit entity. They needed a business
that would come into the community and stay here.''
</P>
<P>
   The success of the center has been infectious, he said, with
some local businesses, including Consolidated Edison and Allstate,
recently donating scholarships for 15 children.
</P>
<P>
   Score is far from the only company in the business of providing
after-school tutoring and learning programs. Huntington Learning
Center, based in Oradell, N.J., operates centers across the
country, including three in Manhattan, which offer instruction to
help students reach grade-level abilities in various subjects. In
Baltimore, the city pays for a program for children from low-income
families to work with Huntington tutors.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvan Learning Centers also operates after-school centers and
contracts with school districts to offer tutoring services in the
schools. One such program operates at Morris High School in the
Bronx. Those programs, which operate under Title I, the federal
program that provides education money for poor children, are also
offered free to students.
</P>
<P>
   While its competitors' programs are largely based on individual
tutoring services, Score depends on a self-paced computer
curriculum. Its centers are staffed by three full-time employees
plus additional assistants, usually college or high-school
students, who answer questions, check progress and distribute
rewards.
</P>
<P>
   For children in a poor neighborhood who are bombarded with
advertisements for dot-com this and that but who are unlikely to
have computers at home, the appeal of getting to work on new
computers at a center like Score cannot be underestimated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like how they teach you on a computer,'' said Bernard
Gifford, a fourth- grader at Public School 282 in Park Slope,
Brooklyn. Bernard, who visits the Score center with his brother,
Bradley, said the work had helped him improve his test grades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to just fill in any answers on tests,'' Bernard said.
``Now I think about it more. And I used to not like reading, but
now I do like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents express much the same sentiment. Benjamin Simmons, a
Crown Heights resident, said his daughter, Dajanee Miskedini, a
fourth-grader at the Holy Rosary School in Bedford-Stuyvesant, was
struggling in math before she started visiting the Score center.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this first quarter, she did better in math than she's ever
done before,'' Simmons said. ``Partly, that's because she gets
motivated here. She loves to come here. Her homework is better, and
she's enthusiastic to go to school. It's been a blessing.''

VIOLENCE RAGES ON AS SRI LANKA ELECTS A PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Subs 2nd graf to update with voting results thus far) 
(DW) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka _ Buffeted by one of Asia's most persistent
and ingenious insurgencies, Sri Lankans voted in large numbers on
Tuesday in a presidential election whose candidates offered little
real hope of peace.
</P>
<P>
   With results from half the polling stations counted on
Wednesday, President Chandrika Kumaratunga led her main challenger,
Ranil Wickeramasinghe, by about 7 percent of the vote after a
campaign that was overwhelmed by a surge of violence.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of themselves, the guerrillas may have created a
sympathy vote for the president, who was wounded Saturday in a
suicide bombing that took at least 24 lives.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, a second explosion killed 12 people at an
opposition rally on the other side of town. A total of 187 people
were wounded. The guerrillas, who are members of the country's
Tamil ethnic minority, are fighting for an independent homeland.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks brought home to the capital a distant war in the
northern Jaffna Peninsula, where the insurgents, the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam, have been fighting for 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   Storming back onto the offensive after a pause of a year and a
half, the insurgents in the last seven weeks have retaken much of
the territory captured by the army in 1995 and 1996. Retrained and
resupplied, they have augmented their well-practiced guerrilla
tactics with devastating artillery barrages.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, 500 government troops have been killed as the
guerrillas try to cut off Elephant Pass, Jaffna's only link to the
rest of the island.
</P>
<P>
   The offensive pushed aside issues of economic hardship and
galvanized an election campaign that Mrs. Kumaratunga called in
October, one year before her term was up, in the full expectation
of an easy victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were plenty of issues to begin with, but the principal
issue now is on the battlefield,'' said Saravana Muttu, who heads
the Center for Policy Alternatives, an independent policy group.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts say the attempt on Mrs. Kumaratunga's life,
which sent shrapnel into her face and left her with a white patch
over her right eye, may have improved her chances in the close
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was leading when the election started, but by the time the
bomb went off she was losing,'' said Kingsley da Silva, executive
director of the International Center for Ethnic Studies, a private
organization that seeks to find formulas for conflict resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Such suicide attacks are a vivid demonstration of the commitment
of the Tamil separatists, many of whom are young women and many of
whom carry cyanide tablets in case of capture.
</P>
<P>
   Similar campaign-rally attacks attributed to the Tamil
insurgents have killed other Sri Lankan politicians, as well as a
former Indian prime minister, Rajiv Gandhi, in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Either because she was recuperating or because she feared an
attack, Mrs. Kumaratunga did not travel to her polling place just
outside the capital Tuesday but had her ballot papers flown in by
helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the electoral process, and disdaining even to comment on
it directly, was a man who over the years has become a leading
figure in Sri Lankan affairs, the guerrilla leader Vellupillai
Prabhakaran, 45. He has a reputation as a man who ``thrives on
war,'' and he is said to inspire the movement's suicide bombers.
</P>
<P>
   With Prabhakaran apparently uninterested in compromise, neither
of the leading presidential candidates has offered a creative or
persuasive approach to resolving the long-running conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Since the war began in 1983, it has taken more than 60,000 lives
and displaced perhaps a million people in this nation of 18
million. Total defense spending has been estimated to consume as
much as one-fourth of the national budget. Tourism, foreign
investment and domestic industry have all suffered.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kumaratunga came to office four years ago on a wave of
euphoria with a promise of peace. But her early overtures to the
rebels made little headway and were replaced by what some analysts
now say was an over-ambitious, over-extended military campaign that
was distorted and weakened by the government's political agendas.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the president's promises of peace, da Silva said, ``If
you look at the number of soldiers killed in the whole war, 4,000
were killed before 1995 and almost double that since then.''
</P>
<P>
   The president now proposes a constitutional amendment that would
offer greater freedoms to the Tamils in the northeast. But the
amendment is general in its terms and unlikely to offer concrete
solutions, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Her chief opponent, Wickeramasinghe, has taken a more
conciliatory line, offering a pause in the fighting and the
possibility of talks. But Prabhakaran has in the past rejected more
generous peace-making overtures, including those of Mrs.
Kumaratunga.
</P>
<P>
   The Tamils are in a minority of just 3.2 million, but they have
close links to a far larger Tamil population just a few miles
across the sea in southern India, where they benefit from sanctuary
and financial support.
</P>
<P>
   Their grievances run deep, with roots in the British colonial
administration that favored the Hindu Tamils as bureaucratic
administrators.
</P>
<P>
   With independence in 1948, the mostly Buddhist Sinhalese, who
make up 74 percent of the population, struck back, imposing
discriminatory laws, making Sinhalese the national language and
withdrawing the citizenship of hundreds of thousands of Tamils.
</P>
<P>
   It is a conflict as deep and intractable as that of Northern
Ireland, said da Silva, and one that requires the kind of
painstaking, drawn-out negotiations that produced a peace agreement
there.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, he said, no one seems ready to take a deep breath
and seek real compromise.

CHILDRENS GIFTS STOLEN FROM HOMELESS SHELTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LISA VAN PROYEN 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; NORTH HOLLYWOOD _ Bah, humbug! Grinch burglars stole $1,000
worth of Christmas gifts from a North Hollywood homeless shelter
that were intended for needy children in the San Fernando Valley
area of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, police officers played Santa Claus by dropping off
125 toys donated by their fellow officers, businesses and resident
``When you're stealing from those in need, it's truly a crime of
great magnitude. That's the lowest, meanest, most insidious type of
crime you could commit,'' said Jeffrey Farber, assistant director
for the Los Angeles Family Housing shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Burglars broke into the Los Angeles Family Housing Corp.'s
shelter sometime between 6 p.m. Dec. 10 and 8 a.m. Dec. 13,
stealing approximately 60 unwrapped toys that had been collected
for a month for 4.
</P>
<P>
   And now, as Christmas Day approaches, some of the same North
Hollywood Division officers who are investigating the crime are now
collecting donated toys.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's horrible, especially this time of year with the children.
We wanted to do something to help,'' said LAPD Sgt. William Martin,
of the North Hollywood Division.
</P>
<P>
   Shelter officials also are scrambling to find businesses and
others to donate replacement toys particularly for the
newborn-to-4-year-old age category. The gifts that were stolen were
for this age group, Farber said.
</P>
<P>
   And the message to the burglars: ``Be a caring adult and give us
our things back so these kids can have them for Christmas. You can
do this anonymously,'' said Steve Spence, director of security for
the shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Rosemary Madrid, 36, lives at the shelter with nine children who
range in age from 11 months to 19 years old. Some of them would
have received the gifts that have now been stolen.
</P>
<P>
   ``For these kids here, this is what they're looking forward
to,'' the mother said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, the shelter threw a Christmas party with
Santagreeting the children. It marked a milestone for one of
Madrid's sons, who previously did not believe in Santa.
</P>
<P>
   ``He ran to Santa and gave him a big hug and later told me,`
`Mom, there is a Santa!''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She also had a message for the thieves: ``Have a heart and
return those gifts, because it's not only the parents, but the kids
that they're hurting. For a lot of families, this is their first
Christmas in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said there was no sign of forced entry into the
building where the gifts were kept.
</P>
<P>
   Shelter officials believe someone not employed by the shelter or
staying there entered through a door that was possibly left ajar
before grabbing the gifts, which included a 3-foot-tall stuffed dog
and giant red Mickey and Minnie Mouse dolls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe that it was one of our employees or clients
because they help us make up the Christmas baskets and they know
how important it is,'' Farber said. ``For a lot of people here,
their last Christmas was spent in a car or camped out on someone's
living room floor.''
</P>
<P>
   The shelter tries to provide a home-like atmosphere for the
clients, giving each child at least one toy, employees said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to give them all the wonderful spirit and
treasures of the holiday,'' said Ann Jacobus, executive director of
the shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the toys would have been delivered to the infants living
at the shelter, which provides food, shelter and support services
to 68 homeless families, including about 160 children.
</P>
<P>
   Shelter officials said they are determined to match the gifts
that were stolen, no matter how hard they must work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll do it one way or another. I think there's a special
circle of hell reserved for people who steal toys from homeless
people at Christmastime,'' Jacobus said.

SONICS CAN'T KEEP PACE WITH HOT-SHOOTING INDIANA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ There are the old Indiana Pacers. Then there are
(BEGIN ITAL) these (END ITAL) Indiana Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the Sonics, the refined Pacers were waiting at
Conseco Fieldhouse Tuesday night. And because open jump shots came
their way like early Christmas presents, the Pacers gave the Sonics
an old-fashioned thrashing from the outside.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana's well-balanced marksmanship added up to a 113-103
victory that snapped the Sonics' three-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't a game the Sonics (18-8) took lightly, unlike their
hard-fought win on Monday against Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the Pacers (16-9) appeared decrepit in the teams' first
meeting on Nov. 28, when the Sonics won 102-91 at KeyArena.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics held Pacers guard Reggie Miller to one field goal and
six points in that game. Since then, the Pacers have found a rhythm
and Miller's located his shooting touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``That loss woke them up,'' Pacers coach Larry Bird said.
</P>
<P>
   It was Miller's groove from beyond the 3-point arc that blew
apart the Sonics Tuesday. Miller sank six of 10 bombs en route to a
game-high 31 points.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana connected on 12 of 24 3-pointers in the game. Every
perimeter player who checked in for the Pacers made at least one
long-range basket.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there were times when the Sonics never rotated to
open scorers, moved too slowly or simply watched the Pacers rain
jumpers over their reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense sucked,'' said Sonics point guard Gary Payton, who
did his best to keep the Sonics afloat with 28 points, 12 assists
and just one turnover.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't cover our assignments the way we practiced. You'd
think we could get it right. We've only been doing this since
October. It's just something where everybody brain-locked.''
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 55-46 at halftime, the Sonics' alertness plummeted in
the second half. They struggled to keep up with Miller, Jalen Rose
and Sam Perkins _ all of whom shot high percentages.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's back-to-back 3-pointers with 6:56 left in the third led
to the Sonics' biggest deficit, 71-52. While the Sonics' offensive
execution wasn't terrible, they did little to stop the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics trailed 85-70 when Miller began the fourth by burying
another 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to play better defense and we, as a team, need to
rebound better,'' Sonics center Horace Grant said. ``We knew they
would play better than they did against us in Seattle. ... They
came out and played like the Pacers who made it to the Eastern
Conference Finals a couple of years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics expected Miller to free himself for good looks at the
basket. But Perkins' 19 points, which included two of three
3-pointers in the fourth, were daggers off the Pacers' bench.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the Pacers made five consecutive 3-pointers in the
fourth. Those bombs turned the Sonics away each time they got
within 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really a good team that beat us,'' Sonics coach Paul
Westphal said. ``You have to give them credit. The shots that they
took and hit were not shots we wanted them to take. We didn't let
them hit 50 percent from the 3-point line, they just hit 50 percent
from the 3-point line.''
</P>
<P>
   What further exasperated the situation was the Sonics' poor
interior defense.
</P>
<P>
   They were outscored, 50-36, in the paint. Indiana's Dale Davis
and Rik Smits dominated down low. Vin Baker finished with 24 points
for the Sonics, but he had just six rebounds. Baker grabbed only
two rebounds in the second half and had none in the decisive third
quarter. He also turned the ball over six times.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal was clearly looking for better play when he pulled
Baker in favor of Jelani McCoy with 8:52 left in the third. Baker
did not return until the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   McCoy quickly parlayed his aggressiveness into two baskets and
three rebounds in 11 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Baker contends he did not take the benching as a message from
Westphal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jelani got in there and did a good job,'' said Baker, whose
defense has been suspect lately. ``At that time, he thought going
to another player (was better) and it worked out for us. It's too
early to worry about whether messages are being sent.''
</P>
<P>
   How about a small memo?
</P>
<P>
   Since starting the season 11-3, the Sonics' record is 7-5 in the
past 12 games. And all five losses have been lopsided ones to title
contenders because of _ among other things _ their flaky defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't play defense enough,'' Payton said. ``Anybody can
play offense. But we've got to play defense to win games.''

   Anyway. Listen, man. You want a reason to come to New York, I'll
give you one.
</P>
<P>
   It's called a RING, man. Your daddy's got three and you can get
one because we're going all the way next season, baby.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, screw Bernie Williams and Derek Jeter and George
Steinbrenner. If I see Big George crying on his turtleneck during
one more World Series ceremony, I'm taking my best bat on the
uptown D train to go after him and Jim Gray.
</P>
<P>
   But like I was saying, Junior. I'll send a private jet to come
get you down there in Orlando. And don't worry about the pilot.
He's a close, personal friend of my uncle Tommy. He worked for
Valu-Jet only a short time. Otherwise, he checks out great. Call
me.
</P>
<P>
   John Franco: Ah gee, Mike! Don't bring up the private jet thing,
will ya? Gimme da phone. Let me say sumthin' to him.
</P>
<P>
   Yo, Kenny, man. This is Johnny Franco. I can understand you're
down on my hometown and you want to be close to your family and all
that, but listen. In Brooklyn, we know all about family.
</P>
<P>
   Fact of the matter is, Kenny, Billy Martin's dead. No one's
going to chase Trey out of the locker room at Shea. And when you're
winning, which we will be, all of New York is like one big, happy
family _ except for maybe Hillary and Rudy, but who gives a rat's
tail about those two Yankee-fan-wannabes, right?
</P>
<P>
   Besides, you move to New York, you can run for U.S. Senate. I'll
vote for you, man. Griffey in 2000. Just call us.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Ventura: He's not going to call.
</P>
<P>
   Newly signed free agent Todd Zeile, who actually wanted to live
in New York: He'll call. He's still buddies with Rickey Henderson.
Remember how Junior wanted the Mariners to sign Rickey last year?
Tell him Rickey wants to talk to him.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza: Let's drop it, fellas, huh?
</P>
<P>
   Ring. Ring. Ring.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza: Hello?
</P>
<P>
   Griffey: So how come the Mets didn't want me two months ago but
they wanted A-Rod and now that Olerud's left-handed bat in the
three hole's gone, the Mets suddenly want me?
</P>
<P>
   Piazza: Ken? That you, man?
</P>
<P>
   Griffey: I'm waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza: Yeah, well, you know how crazy this business is.
Remember what happened to me in L.A.?
</P>
<P>
   Griffey: Still waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza: Listen, Ken. Don't take this stuff personally. It's all
a game. You state your position. They wheel and deal and try and
freak you out. You sweat and dig your heels in. They do what they
gotta do.
</P>
<P>
   It's ugly. It's baseball. Let's play two.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, look at me.
</P>
<P>
   By the time I was traded to New York, I didn't know the Statue
of Liberty from the La Brea Tar Pits. I went from the Dodgers to
the Marlins to the Mets and I still wasn't sure where I wanted to
end up.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey: Well, that's not me. I'm going back to Seattle. Nuts to
Pat Gillick. Nuts to Chuck Armstrong. Nuts to Howard Lincoln. I'll
do what I want, when I want. I'm a 10-and-5-guy. They're just a
5-and-10-cent operation.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza: Now, Junior. Why you wanna go back? What's the point?
The M's aren't going to win the Series. Not with the Braves and us
and the Yankees all juiced for another run. Why not come here for a
year, find out for yourself how great this is, then ...
</P>
<P>
   Griffey: Got some unfinished business. Got to find out exactly
who in the Mariner organization called me ``a spoiled brat.'' I got
some ideas, but I'm going to have some fun nailing the sucker.
That'll keep me going.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza: Isn't there anything I can do to make you change your
mind?
</P>
<P>
   Griffey: Not unless you're talking about Cincinnati. I gotta go
now. We're on the 14th hole. Tiger and Mark O'Meara are getting
antsy. I'm making them drive with a pitching wedge while I get the
Big Bertha. My turn to hit.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza: OK. See ya.
</P>
<P>
   Click.
</P>
<P>
   Franco: What he say?
</P>
<P>
   Piazza: I have no idea.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura: He's not coming, is he?
</P>
<P>
   Piazza, scratching his head: No. And thank goodness.

TCU SHOOTS 70 FREE THROWS IN DOUBLE OT WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Launching his postgame address after a
battle with Eastern Michigan that defied several points of logic,
TCU coach Billy Tubbs was, as usual, succinct.
</P>
<P>
   ``Game ran a little long,'' he deadpanned. ``Kinda like one of
those \Rfootball\S games where you throw a lot of incomplete
passes.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the Frogs (7-4) displayed amazing marksmanship in one
crucial area _ making 56 of 70 free-throw attempts _ both figures
representing school records _ that carried them to a 107-101 double
overtime victory against the Eagles (5-3).
</P>
<P>
   TCU played the game without guard Ryan Carroll, who sat on the
bench, but has a mild case of pneumonia and could miss several
games. The Eagles finished it without five players _ including four
starters _ who fouled out.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is unbelievable,'' said EMU coach Milton Barnes, who
watched his team incur a 45-point deficit at the line, making 11 of
18. ``You're talking about 70 free throws to 18. It really does a
crime to the game, because I think both teams played hard. I've
never seen a game like this _ never heard of one.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, I'm proud of my team, and I want to thank Billy for
having us down here.''
</P>
<P>
   Tubbs, whose team leads the WAC in free-throw percentage, said
he felt the game actually ran true to form.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shoot free throws pretty well,'' he said. ``And we shot
about as well from the floor (.348 percent) as everyone else does.
They're a tough, physical team, and people have trouble shooting
against them. It's hard to shoot with 210 pounds draped over you.''
</P>
<P>
   During regulation, the Eagles outshot TCU from the field and
held a wide rebounding edge, although both figures diminished in
the late stages. For the game, Eastern Michigan outrebounded TCU,
53-49, had 21 assists to just 12 for the Frogs and had 19 more
field goals, but still lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started fouling out,'' Barnes said, ``we got
smaller.''
</P>
<P>
   Although TCU had five players in double figures _ including
Marquise Gainous, Estell Laster and Larry Allaway with 20 each _
the Eagles led through most of the second half and seemed to have
survived a comeback by the Frogs when Craig Erquhart tied Gainous
up on the baseline with 15 seconds left in an 85-83 game.
</P>
<P>
   But Thomas McTyer stole EMU's inbounds pass and flipped it to
Allaway, who was fouled by Alvin Howard with 12.5 second left.
Allaway _ playing despite a stomach virus _ hit both shots to send
it into overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``How big was that?'' Tubbs said. ``Big big.''
</P>
<P>
   By this time, EMU's Calvin Warner (21 points, 10 rebounds) had
fouled out, but the Eagles tied the game early in the second
overtime at 92 on C.J. Grantham's two free throws with six seconds
left.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Eagles had finally run out of gas. TCU jumped
quickly to a four-point lead in the second overtime and doggedly
held on. With the score 103-101 with 30 seconds remaining, Laster
and Myron Anthony dropped in the last four free throws, and it was
finally over.

DUCKS GETTING DEFENSIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Greg Christensen  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Defense is becoming a religion of sorts with
the Anaheim Mighty Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Craig Hartsburg is the high priest and his most devoted
disciples go by the names of Kariya, Selanne and Rucchin.
</P>
<P>
   Teemu Selanne, a former 76-goal scorer, has become such a zealot
that his eyes light up when talking about playing
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd score five goals if we could win a Stanley Cup,'' Selanne
said. ``Winning, that's what it is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had individual awards and those are nice, but they don't
mean anything because we haven't won (as a team),'' Paul Kariya
added.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, however, the Ducks have been winning. Anaheim is 5-1-2
in its past eight games and has moved four games over .500
(17-13-4-1) for the second time in franchise history. The team has
allowed only 10 goals in the eight games and just four during its
current four-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim comes into tonight's Pacific Division showdown with
Phoenix allowing only 2.15 goals a game, second best in the NHL.
The Ducks have limited teams to two goals or less in eight
consecutive games and 22 times in the first 34 games.
</P>
<P>
   Asked his impression of the team's lofty defensive status,
center Steve Rucchin grinned and said ``surprised?''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it has been a remarkable conversion for a team that gave
up 3.2 goals a game under Pierre Page two seasons ago.
</P>
<P>
   Hartsburg, a former defenseman, came to town with a mission,
knowing that no team could be competitive in today's NHL giving up
those kind of numbers. He began preaching, and preaching, and
preaching defense although he prefers to call his philosophy an
``all-round team game.''
</P>
<P>
   Kariya also doesn't care to call the Ducks' system a defensive
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are playing offense smarter,'' he said. ``We are not making
the high-risk plays and turning the puck over.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what the system is called, the players have become
converts to Hartsburg's methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a huge sales job last year,'' Hartsburg said. ``But now
they've had success the last year and a half.''
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim cut its goals-against to 2.5 and made the playoffs last
season, but it was a team that lived on the edge. The Ducks were
outscored at even strength and lived and depended heavily on the
league's No. 1 power play.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the power play has struggled (tied for 25th), but the
Ducks have outscored their opponents 66-46 at even strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty scary to think where we could be if the power play
was where it should be,'' said Rucchin.
</P>
<P>
   But the defense was good enough to keep the Ducks afloat until
their recent run when they started scoring the key goals that were
nowhere to be found earlier in the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they are taking pride in that part of the game,'' said
Hartsburg, ``and that starts with Paul, Teemu and Rucchin. Our best
players have bought into (the system) and if they buy into it
there's no reason the other guys can't.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we cheat and don't play both ends why should anybody
else,'' said Kariya.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 1 line's point production is down a little _ Kariya has
33 points, Selanne 32 and Rucchin 22 _ but when it comes to playing
an all-round game, it's never played better. Kariya is NHL's
plus/minus leader among forwards at plus-20, Selanne is plus-17 and
Rucchin plus-12.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys aren't concerned about personal success,'' Rucchin said.
``A lot of numbers are down, but as long as we win it doesn't
matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the greatest compliment on the transformation of the
Ducks is that coaching legend Scotty Bowman has taken notice. Last
April, the Detroit coach watched his Red Wings overwhelm Anaheim in
a first-round playoff sweep that Selanne has often described as
``embarrassing.''
</P>
<P>
   But things have changed, according to Bowman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anaheim is a better team,'' he said. ``You always hear about
Kariya and Selanne, but they (the Ducks) are not getting enough
credit for their defensive game, they are playing much better
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   After being swept away by the Red Wings, Anaheim general manager
Pierre Gauthier upgraded his defense in a matter of hours on draft
day by trading for Oleg Tverdovsky and drafting 26-year-old Swedish
veteran Niclas Havelid.
</P>
<P>
   Those two, along with the emergence of Pavel Trnka, have
upgraded the skill level of a group that played hard, but often
struggled to get the puck out of the Anaheim zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big key is to be able to outlet the puck and sometimes
jump into the play,'' said goalie Guy Hebert, who is facing 27.4
shots a game this season, compared to 31.6 a year ago. ``I'd always
wanted a big banger on the blue line, but Pierre convinced me that
time of possession is the key. The less time the puck is in our
zone the better.''
</P>
<P>
   Hebert and backup Dominic Roussel are certainly reaping the
rewards of playing behind a defense that is more and more skating
or passing the puck out of harm's way, rather than banging it off
the boards. Hebert is among the league leaders in goals-against
average (2.03), wins (13), save percentage (.927) and shutouts
(three).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about puck control,'' Tverdovsky said, who is proving
to be much more than just an offensive-minded defenseman this
season. ``The more we have the puck, the more good things will
happen for us.''

Canada in a car they say was loaded with jars of nitroglycerine,
timing devices and other bomb-making materials, American
intelligence officials knew little about him. But the arrest set
off alarms in France, where anti-terrorist officials had been
focusing on the 32-year-old Ressam because of his connections to a
radical Islamic group that French investigators suspect had carried

DESPITE TROUBLES, GAILEY'S JOB IS SAFE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When asked recently how he copes with bad calls from the
officials _ and the Dallas Cowboys have seen more than their share
this season _ coach Chan Gailey said ``you hope you stay employed
long enough for it to even out.''
</P>
<P>
   This goes under the heading of ... since you brought it up.
</P>
<P>
   And, well, Gailey did bring it up _ his job security, that is.
</P>
<P>
   While Gailey hasn't been given a playoffs-or-else ultimatum _
the Cowboys (7-7) would qualify for the postseason by winning their
final two games Friday against the New Orleans Saints (2-12) and
Jan. 2 against the New York Giants (7-7) _ rumors have been
circulating that owner Jerry Jones is growing increasingly
dissatisfied with his team's dismal performances overall, and
offensively in particular.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Jones denied any truth to talk that Gailey's job as
head coach or offensive coordinator is on the line, and furthermore
said he regrets that the issue has even come up because Gailey
``doesn't deserve it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones did acknowledge extreme frustration with the Cowboys'
season but maintained he's not about to act punitively against his
coach.
</P>
<P>
   Jones remains supportive, despite a season that has somewhat
contradicted everything the second-year coach was supposedly hired
for _ offensive imagination and discipline.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have demonstrated neither on a consistent basis in
1999. The offense has been predictable and unimaginative at times.
The on-field discipline is seemingly worse now than in the Barry
Switzer days, when you consider the Cowboys' league-leading penalty
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, however, said he has no plans to alter ``his'' decision
for Gailey to continue as his own offensive coordinator and play
caller. In fact, he said, it's encouraging to know that his head
coach is spending his time where the Cowboys were having their most
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' continued support is based on a variety of reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, this season is far from over. The Cowboys could sweep
their final two games, make the playoffs and make a glorious run to
the Super Bowl. Though that seems unlikely, considering the Cowboys
play this season, Jones remains hopeful and refuses to think
otherwise until he has reason not to.
</P>
<P>
   And is it possible that he could rethink his position on Gailey
if the Cowboys don't make the playoffs?
</P>
<P>
   Because Jones hates losing, anything is possible.
</P>
<P>
   However, according to one Cowboys official, who certainly has
Jones' ear, the Cowboys litany of injuries in 1999 clouds the
situation. He said the injuries make it difficult for Jones to
judge Gailey. Thirteen players are on the injured reserve list,
topped b the loss of two of their top three receivers in Michael
Irvin and James McKnight.
</P>
<P>
   If you think the Cowboys' offense would be better with Irvin and
McKnight, then how can Gailey be at fault for circumstances out of
his control?
</P>
<P>
   Opposing this contention, however, are some cold realities.
</P>
<P>
   The NFC is bad and the NFC East is horrendous. Even without
Irvin, the Cowboys should be the class of the division and contend
for the Super Bowl in the wide-open, parity-filled NFC.
</P>
<P>
   It's mindboggling to most people, most notably Jones, that the
Cowboys offense, which still has running back Emmitt Smith,
quarterback Troy Aikman, receiver Raghib Ismail and one of the
league's top offensive lines, is this bad. Either Jones is wrong
that a healthy Aikman is the key to being a Super Bowl contender _
that is why he locked him to up 2007 for $85 million _ or the
offensive philosophy is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, and potentially most damning for Gailey, is that his
offensive philosophy is not endorsed by the team's biggest stars.
Let's rephrase that, neither Irvin, Smith nor ... Aikman like the
Cowboys' offense. Irvin and Smith's disagreements with Gailey's
grand plan have already been on record.
</P>
<P>
   And while Aikman has been professional about not dissing
Gailey's offense in public, his body language and his generally
deliberate answers when talking about the offense seem to tell a
different story. And, according to a few Cowboys players, Aikman
isn't shy about voicing his displeasure behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, however, dismisses the bad feelings his stars have about
the offense as part of the baggage of change. He said all three
were highly successful in the Cowboys previous offense and
therefore are critical when things don't go well in a new system.
He said they will believe in this offense when they start having
more success in it.
</P>
<P>
   The question, however, is whether their lack of faith now is
part of the reason why they are not successful now. History has
shown _ 1997's 6-10 campaign _ that when Aikman and company don't
believe in something or somebody (Barry Switzer) they don't play
well.
</P>
<P>
   They certainly haven't played well in 1999. If the Cowboys don't
get on a miraculous run in the last two games, how is 1999 any
different than 1997?
</P>
<P>
   For the team or Gailey. nn

BREAKS GOING COWBOYS' WAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The good news never stops coming for the Dallas
Cowboys this week.
</P>
<P>
   On a day in which they learned that the New Orleans Saints will
start 24-year-old rookie quarterback Jake ``The Cajun Snake''
Delhomme, who has never thrown an NFL pass, most of the players
found out Tuesday that they still have control over whether they
make the NFL playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The news from the league office that if the Cowboys win their
remaining two games, they're in, was met with a measure of reserve
by Emmitt Smith on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've controlled our own destiny all along anyway, from start
to finish,'' Smith said with a shrug. ``(This time) we've got to
take care of business.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking care of business for the 7-7 Cowboys means winning their
remaining games, against the 2-12 New Orleans Saints on Friday at
the Superdome and the New York Giants, currently 7-7, at Texas
Stadium on Jan. 2.
</P>
<P>
   But for the third week in a row, they will be facing an
inexperienced quarterback who didn't begin the season as his team's
starter: Philadelphia rookie Donovan McNabb, the Jets' Ray Lucas
and now Delhomme.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, hovering at .500 for the fourth time this season,
are 1-1 so far in those matchups.
</P>
<P>
   Delhomme grew up in Lafayette, La., attended Southwestern
Louisiana, played two springs in NFL Europe and thinks that
spoiling Christmas (and probably the season) for the Cowboys with a
Saints victory on Friday would be great fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing spoiler,'' Delhomme said, ``that's really all we have
left for the rest of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys still have a shot at the NFC East title (depending
on what Washington does in its remaining two games against San
Francisco and Miami) but, more into the spirit of the holiday
season, the Cowboys received a gift in the form of some favorable
tiebreakers, which allow that if they win their remaining two
games, they are assured at least of one of the three NFC wild-card
bids.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we got last week was a gift, too,'' Cowboys offensive
tackle Erik Williams said with a touch of sarcasm. ``Everybody in
our division (Redskins, Giants and Cardinals) lost, and all we had
to do was go out (against the Jets) and win ....''
</P>
<P>
   When that didn't happen, the Cowboys did the next best thing.
They sat around and waited one day for the NFL's tiebreaker system
to give them control of their own destiny again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surprised? Maybe,'' said Smith. ``But I'm not caught up in
what can happen. I'm more concerned about (improving) because we've
got some work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys with work to do? Let us count the warts.
</P>
<P>
   Pass offense: The Cowboys rank a season-low 25th among the NFL's
31 teams.
</P>
<P>
   Touchdown passes: Only nine NFL teams have thrown for fewer
touchdowns than the Cowboys (16), and this after Troy Aikman opened
the season with a career-best five TD passes at Washington on Sept.
12.
</P>
<P>
   Total offense: The Cowboys rank 18th in the league. They've been
as low as 20th.
</P>
<P>
   Penalties: The Cowboys lead the league in both penalties (118)
and penalty yards (1,054), a dubious distinction that they've held
for most of the season. The NFL average per team is 93.8 flags for
780.9 yards.
</P>
<P>
   But it has been the ill-timed manner of these penalties,
nullifying long gains and even taking points off the board this
season, that has been more hard-felt than the total number of
flags.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had just too many penalties coming at critical times,''
said coach Chan Gailey.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is more troubled with getting the offense to work more
consistently. For example, he is concerned about what the Cowboys
have been able to do _ or not do _ on third-and-one all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've got deeper issues than penalties,'' Smith said.
``We have yet to convert on third-and-short. That's been an issue.
That's been a problem. Then you add that on top of the penalties
... and you have what we are right now, 7-7.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion,'' Smith said, ``we haven't shown that we're a
good enough team to overcome those mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Can the Cowboys turn it around against the Saints and Giants?
</P>
<P>
   That would require the Cowboys to win back-to-back games for the
first time since they opened the season 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically against the Saints, it would mean winning on the
road for the first time since opening the season with an overtime
victory at Washington. Since that game, the Cowboys are 0-6 away
from Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Also specifically against the Saints, it would mean beating a
non-divisional opponent on the road for the first time since the
1997 season opener at Pittsburgh. And it would mean paying back a
Saints team that beat the Cowboys, 22-3, just over 12 months ago in
a game in which Smith rushed 15 times for 6 yards.
</P>
<P>
   That's a lot of baggage to haul to New Orleans and back.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is no time to panic,'' Smith said. ``It's just a matter
now of going out there and doing it. That's something we haven't
done as a team, or enough on a consistent basis. How do we do that?
Where do we start? I don't have the answers to that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, 4-7 since Oct. 10, are ready to get into the
playoffs any way possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heck, Buffalo went to the (1992) playoffs as a wild-card and
reached the Super Bowl,'' said Smith. ``The (1980) Oakland Raiders
did the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, there is plenty of reason for hope with the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason we have hope,'' Smith said, ``is because it's not
over.'' nn

DOWN-TRODDEN SAINTS COULD MAKE ROUGH ROAD FOR COWBOYS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ How do you spell relief?
</P>
<P>
   S-A-I-N-T-S.
</P>
<P>
   At least the Dallas Cowboys hope so. Dallas needs to win its
final two games _ at New Orleans and at home against the New York
Giants _ to be assured of a playoff berth. What better place to
begin a winning streak than in the Superdome against the miserable
Saints, losers of 11 of their past 12, on Christmas Eve?
</P>
<P>
   Well, the Cowboys aren't exactly looking past the Saints. Talk
in the locker room has focused solely on themselves and the serious
nature of this game. The Cowboys haven't won on the road since the
season opener, and fresh on everyone's mind is last December's
embarrassment in the Big Easy.
</P>
<P>
   Saints 22, Cowboys 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to take care of what we've got to do,'' said Emmitt
Smith, who was held to 6 yards on 15 carries as the Cowboys managed
8 yards of rushing in last season's meeting. ``Last year is a bad
memory. The only way to correct that is to play better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Saints muzzled the Cowboys with an onslaught of run-blitz
packages that Dallas never picked up from start to finish. Led by
defensive tackle La'Roi Glover, one of the few bright spots for the
Saints this season, New Orleans will again play to stop the run and
force the uncertain Cowboys' passing game to make something happen.
</P>
<P>
   Saints coach Mike Ditka has had nothing go right since he traded
the team's entire 1999 draft for the rights to Ricky Williams,
whose season has been riddled with injuries. Ditka said his defense
provides little confidence in holding the Cowboys down again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chances of us having a defensive game like last season are
slim and none,'' Ditka said. ``Not that we won't try. But, the
offense has to do their job, and the defense has to do their job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it would be good to stop the running game, but I don't
see that happening.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Saints' defense, which ranks 21st in the NFL, does not
inspire confidence, there's no describing their 20th-ranked
offense. Ditka said Tuesday that Williams will play, but he'll line
up behind fourth-string quarterback Jake Delhomme, a second-year
player out of Southwestern Louisiana (now Louisiana-Lafayette), and
a born Saints fan, in his first NFL game.
</P>
<P>
   This game likely will come down, again, to the Cowboys' offense.
Smith has run tough all season, so Troy Aikman and his young corps
of receivers will be responsible for taking the load off Smith.
That will be especially true when the Saints stack the line of
scrimmage and practically dare the Cowboys to beat them through the
air.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year they caught us off-balance,'' Cowboys right tackle
Erik Williams said. ``They had success doing that, so why not do it
again?''
</P>
<P>
   Said Smith: ``We still have to play our best. If we don't, we'll
be right back here singing the same old song in the same old nasty
tune.''

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The lawyer for Dallas Mavericks rookie Leon Smith
expects to have the 6-foot-10 forward in a Chicago courtroom
Thursday morning at 9 to face three misdemeanor charges.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Berkson said Smith will leave the Dallas psychiatric
treatment center where he has been staying and fly to Chicago to
face charges of aggravated assault, violation of an order of
protection, and criminal damage to property. Those crimes are
misdemeanors punishable by fines and up to a year in jail.
</P>
<P>
   The aggravated assault charge stems from a Dec. 1 incident when
Smith approached his ex-girlfriend, Cappie Pondexter, at Chicago's
Marshall High School and allegedly threatened her with a gun. Smith
turned himself into Chicago police the next night after he
discovered there was a warrant issued for his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   He was released on bail on Dec. 3 and was arrested again after
the automobile of Vanessa Pondexter was rammed and the windows
smashed. Vanessa Pondexter is the mother of Cappie Pondexter. In
that case, Smith was charged with violating an order of protection
to stay away from Cappie Pondexter and of damage to property.
</P>
<P>
   Berkson said unless something unusual happens, he doesn't expect
Smith to be in court for more than 20 minutes. He also said the
psychiatric treatment Smith is receiving has been helpful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leon is doing better,'' Berkson said. ``He's progressing, he's
getting treatment. That's a good sign, and it's a very encouraging
sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Berkson refused to admonish the Mavericks for their alleged
shabby treatment of Smith, which included keeping him away from the
team's veteran players who possibly could have assisted him in his
transition from Chicago's Martin Luther King High School to the
NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they were sensitive to his needs in the
beginning,'' Berkson said. ``I think they probably should have
understood Leon a little more than they did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that there's certain expectations when they draft
people. It's probably just the wrong team that he got picked by.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Smith walked out of a players' assistance aftercare
treatment facility in Atlanta in November _ combined with his two
arrests _ the Mavericks suspended him indefinitely without pay on
Dec. 6. Thus, those bimonthly $37,500 paychecks Smith was receiving
have been terminated until further notice.
</P>
<P>
   Berkson said he's sure Smith is in a financial bind, especially
since he has no source of income because of the suspension.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing Leon has going for him is he has insurance, and
he's being covered,'' Berkson said. ``The National Basketball
Players Association certainly isn't going to abandon him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The direct needs that he has now, as far as his
hospitalization, that's covered. (But his rent payment) is another
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   After Smith's court appearance, Berkson hopes to have Smith out
of Chicago and back in the psychiatric treatment facility as
quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was raised in five different Chicago group rooms and was a
ward of the state of Illinois from age 4 through 18. He was
abandoned by his parents at age 5, and has said he has a difficult
time trusting people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a lot of people are pulling for Leon,'' Berkson said.
``I told him, `There are millions of people who would like to be in
your position.
</P>
<P>
   `` `So, no matter how bad you think your position is, there's an
awful lot of people that would change places with you.' ''

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Public enemy No. 1 was running through his usual menu of assists,
rebounds and steals. With Rockets fans pouring derision like beer
at a frat party, Scottie Pippen had helped send the Trail Blazers
to a fast start and seemed to relish the boos that provided the
soundtrack for his every move.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Suddenly, he shot as if he were still wearing Rockets stripes.
He was Bobby Knight on a hunting vacation. He missed six straight,
including his first four in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets were poised to take a stunning and emotional win.
</P>
<P>
   But with the game on the line, the guy with six NBA championship
rings pulled up to nail a pair of jumpers, the second a crushing
trey. And the young Rockets, who had swept past the Trail Blazers
all night, were blinded again by the scoreboard's glowing ``4'' as
Portland coolly pulled away for an 89-79 win Tuesday night before
16,285 in Compaq Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's that Four Tops song?'' Rudy Tomjanovich lamented of the
latest fourth-quarter fold. ``It's The Same Old Song.''
</P>
<P>
   But the next line might have been just as telling because it
spoke of `` since you've been gone.''
</P>
<P>
   In his return, Pippen could not dominate any more than he could
in his abbreviated Rockets run. But unlike the crucial moments of
his failed season in Houston, with the Rockets within two with 4:55
left, he made consecutive shots.
</P>
<P>
   They were his first field goals since the first quarter, but
they staked the Trail Blazers to all the scoring they would need.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scottie is not a stand-still shooter,'' Rockets forward Matt
Bullard said. ``He hit both on pull-ups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really close. We play well for 3{ quarters. But the way
the NBA game is, at the end of the game, you have to have a go-to
thing. We're still trying to figure out what our go-to thing is. In
the process, we're making bad mistakes that lose us the games. It's
not one person. It's the whole team.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Francis disagreed. He said it was not the whole team.
Francis blamed himself.
</P>
<P>
   But Francis was hardly reckless. He had two fourth-quarter
turnovers. He had the ball once as the shot clock expired.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last 8{ minutes of the game, the Rockets made just
one field goal, a Francis breakaway layup. Cuttino Mobley had
nailed a trey with 8:48 left to pull the Rockets within 76-74.
Francis' layup brought them back to within two with 4:55 left.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you need to get a shot, when you're down five points with
four minutes left, we make turnovers, offensive fouls, things that
winning teams don't do,'' Bullard said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets had committed six turnovers in the first six minutes
of the fourth quarter. Then after Francis' basket, the Rockets
missed their last six shots, scoring only on two Bullard free
throws with 3:24 left.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Thomas, who played the entire fourth quarter in place of
starter Carlos Rogers, missed a 3-pointer. Francis missed a pair of
jumpers and a trey.
</P>
<P>
   Mobley had burned Pippen throughout the night, scoring 20 points
off the bench. But the Blazers shifted Stacey Augmon to defend
Mobley.
</P>
<P>
   Augmon had been cut by the Rockets after coming over in the
Pippen trade, but he held Mobley scoreless in the last eight
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mobley was putting on a performance tonight,'' Blazers coach
Mike Dunleavy said. ``He was making plays and shots that you don't
see every night. I thought ultimately Stacey did a pretty good job
on him.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of the fourth quarter, Mobley hardly could get a shot.
In the last two minutes, Mobley drove to the rim but couldn't get a
roll. He missed a 3 from the corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had wide-open shots and didn't knock them down,''
Tomjanovich said. ``They came down and made two wide-open shots,
and the dam broke.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes our emotions distract us and cause us to have costly
turnovers. It's hard for the young guys to make the big play at
clutch time. We can't get distracted at the end of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth quarter, the Rockets made just three of 10 shots,
taking away their chances at an upset with eight turnovers in the
period. Their 11 fourth-quarter points were their fewest of a
season overloaded with late collapses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely turned the ball over at the end of the game,
especially me,'' Francis said. ``We've got to hit shots. A lot of
us missed a lot of shots. If we hit one or two of those shots, we
would have won the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played aggressive. We took good shots. Coach commended us
on taking open shots. The fourth quarter is definitely clutch time.
We have to learn to step up and hit those big jump shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you would have told me Scottie Pippen was going to come
down and hit back-to-back shots in transition, I would never have
believed that.''
</P>
<P>
   And Francis wasn't even around last season. Those who filled the
arena to send Pippen a message left hoarse and stunned, frustrated
by Pippen again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew the fans were going to get on me, but I tried to stay
focused on what our team needed to do,'' Pippen said. ``They were
taunting me. I really didn't say anything to the fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans made it fun for me. I like playing in an atmosphere
like this. It was like playing in the Finals.''
</P>
<P>
   It was as close as the Rockets have come lately. But in that
respect, at least Pippen did deliver on the promise to bring them
there.

STARS MOVE UP IN STANDINGS WITH TIE
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALGARY, Alberta _ A lot was riding on Tuesday night's game for
the Dallas Stars.
</P>
<P>
   With St. Louis easily handling Phoenix, the Stars had a chance
to jump into a tie with the Coyotes for first place in the Pacific
Division. All they had to do was beat Calgary.
</P>
<P>
   Easier said than done.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars instead had to settle for a 0-0 tie as the two goalies
combined to make 63 saves. The tie gave the Stars one of the two
points they desired and jumped them into a second-place tie in the
division.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only positive is we jumped over a couple of teams
tonight,'' Stars forward Mike Keane said. ``And, hey, a tie is
better than a loss.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars were able to get that much out of the game because of
goalie Ed Belfour. He finished with 31 saves, including five in
overtime. They weren't able to get anything more because of Flames
goalie Fred Brathwaite. He finished with 32 saves, including three
in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought both goalies had full control of the game,'' Stars
coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``I think it's a good tie.''
</P>
<P>
   Overtime, just like the game, turned into an exchange of quality
chances, but the goalies weren't going to let anything by them.
Stars winger Brett Hull finished with a game-high eight shots. The
Stars' first line with Hull, Mike Modano and Kirk Muller had 17.
</P>
<P>
   They just couldn't score.
</P>
<P>
   ``You rely on Brett Hull to get the goal, and he doesn't get
it,'' Hull said. ``I think that's what is frustrating to me right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Flames had 11 shots in the first period, including a number
of near misses where if Belfour hadn't done the amazing or slid
into spots he really had no business of getting to Calgary would've
left the first period with a two- or three-goal lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``He, like all season, was our best player,'' Stars center Guy
Carbonneau said.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour wasn't supposed to start. Hitchcock had decided to go
with backup Manny Fernandez. But when a knee bruise sidelined him,
it was back to Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour looked sharp despite playing in his third game in five
nights. He had to be.
</P>
<P>
   He made his third consecutive start and he stayed pretty busy in
the first period.
</P>
<P>
   But the Stars returned the favor in the second period,
outshooting the Flames 13-5. Hull had five shots. Brathwaite
followed Belfour's lead, though, stopping a number of good Stars
chances. Their best ones came on a 5-on-3 early in the period, but
the power play was stalled when referees whistled defenseman Darryl
Sydor for interference.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars received another power-play chance at 13:58 of the
third period. But while generating a lot of good shots, the best a
whistler by Hull, they failed to score.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars came into Calgary riding an 8-2-1 streak in their past
11 games. The Flames were riding a streak of their own, undefeated
in their past five games at the Canadian Airlines Saddledome.
</P>
<P>
   And while the Stars didn't win, they didn't lose.
</P>
<P>
   The tie enabled them to leapfrog Los Angeles and Anaheim in the
standings.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad considering the Stars began the day in last place in the
Pacific Division and were playing without two of their best players
for a second consecutive game.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tie is always better than a loss, especially with all the
stuff we've had happen,'' Carbonneau said. ``We lost our captain
and were playing without (Joe Nieuwendyk), and we still managed to
make a move in the standings.'' nn

<P>
   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
THE problem was, Scottie Pippen came ``home'' wearing the wrong
uniform. Had the Rockets sent him someplace bad, like back to
Chicago, there might have been more satisfaction to be gleaned from
jeering him every time he touched the ball.
</P>
<P>
   However, since everybody suspected from the outset Pippen's new
team, Portland, was going to prevail, the catcalls rang hollow.
Pippen, taciturn except for an occasional smug smile, ignored the
dogged harassment, played with his usual lack of overt passion or
emotion and, as fate would have it, scored the fatal five points
that squelched the Rockets' final rally. Hence, the big creep
laughed last.
</P>
<P>
   Trail Blazers 89, Rockets 79. The beat _ and beatings _ go on.
``The same old song,'' Rudy Tomjanovich called Tuesday night's
predictable, repetitive lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the Rockets did Pip the Drip a huge favor to ship him
out of town. At least the players they obtained for him _ Carlos
Rogers and Kelvin Cato _ who participated in the game outscored him
18-13 and outrebounded him 15-8. Small consolation, but consolation
nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot of fun,'' Scottie said of the predictable barrage
of taunts and barbs and smattering of audible obscenities, plus the
obligatory ``vacuum cleaner'' chant. ``The fans made it fun for me.
As a player, that's something you look forward to. You want to rise
to the occasion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't like you,'' one guy shouted at Pippen during a
timeout with a little more than three minutes left, prompting a
smirk from Scottie, who again is pulling down almost $15 million
for being exactly the same kind of role player he had been for the
Bulls and was last season for the Rockets. Except in Portland,
which is wallowing in talent, he can afford to be a pure-platinum
cog, a luxury sprocket, in the machine. Although the Blazers have
hardly been sizzling of late, don't be too surprised if Pippen, the
fink, doesn't cop a seventh championship ring come June.
</P>
<P>
   He is a perfect fit there, since Mike Dunleavy hardly needs,
wants or expects him to be The Man. His merely being a man, a tall
order sometimes for Scottie, will suffice.
</P>
<P>
   His line for the evening _ 13 points, eight rebounds and,
according to the stat sheet, eight assists _ should have looked all
too familiar to the Rockets and their tortured customers. It was a
typical Pippen performance, and plenty good enough for him to
contribute sufficiently to a winning cause in Portland.
</P>
<P>
   He is being paid like a super-duper star, yet he remains a
complementary player, if not in the case of his ex-teammate and
ex-friend, the fallen Charles Barkley, a complimentary one.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may not be the greatest go-to guy in the world,'' the
diplomatic Dunleavy says. ``If I'm going to start a team and pick
one player, there are a lot of others I'd pick. But he has the
ability to make all your guys go-to guys. He makes everybody
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Hmmm.
</P>
<P>
   Until Pippen sank back-to-back jumpers, the latter one a
3-pointer, with just inside of five minutes to go, he was 3-for-10
and hadn't made a field goal since the first quarter, when he went
3-for-4. But the Rockets had opted not to go straight at him with
Cuttino Mobley at the outset, keeping Matt Bullard in the starting
lineup instead, and Scottie's tank was full when money time began.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen's first bucket answered a Kenny Thomas miss that would
have tied the score at 79, and the second erased his oh-fer on the
night from beyond the arc.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even rub it in their (the fans') faces, did I?'' he
said of his bang-bang kill shots. ``I just kept playing like I had
all night. It's about us winning, not about the fans. We came here
to win, and we did.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets, whose points-to-turnovers ratio in the fourth
quarter was a dreadful 11-8, were done. Their finishing skills, as
they lurch into the painful process called rebuilding, are
nonexistent. They don't even suspect how to win when the tension
takes hold, which is why they stand (so to speak) 8-18, a ``pace''
that will leave them 25-57 and safely buried in the lottery mix
when April 19 mercifully rolls around.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great experience for these (young) guys,'' Rudy T said,
spinning for all he was worth. ``There's got to be some pain for
there to be a gain. It's not just in weightlifting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're losing our focus. We're making some bad decisions. But
we're doing some great things, too, to get in a position to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Or not to, as is most often the case.
</P>
<P>
   And were Pippen still a Rocket, the Rockets would still be going
nowhere fast. It is better for all parties that he was just passing
through, a good idea that begat insufficient results. Just the
same, might I take this opportunity to add one final booooo!!! on
behalf of the entire city of Houston?
</P>
<P>
   There. Everybody feel better?

TCU PUTS EVERYTHING ON THE LINE IN DOUBLE-OVERTIME VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 MICHIGAN-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Launching his postgame address after a
battle with Eastern Michigan that defied several points of logic,
TCU coach Billy Tubbs was, as usual, succinct.
</P>
<P>
   ``Game ran a little long,'' he deadpanned. ``Kinda like one of
those (football) games where you throw a lot of incomplete
passes.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the Frogs (7-4) displayed amazing marksmanship in one
crucial area _ making 56 of 70 free-throw attempts _ both figures
representing school records _ that carried them to a 107-101 double
overtime victory against the Eagles (5-3).
</P>
<P>
   TCU played the game without guard Ryan Carroll, who sat on the
bench, but has a mild case of pneumonia and could miss several
games. The Eagles finished it without five players _ including four
starters _ who fouled out.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is unbelievable,'' said EMU coach Milton Barnes, who
watched his team incur a 45-point deficit at the line, making 11 of
18. ``You're talking about 70 free throws to 18. It really does a
crime to the game, because I think both teams played hard. I've
never seen a game like this _ never heard of one.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, I'm proud of my team, and I want to thank Billy for
having us down here.''
</P>
<P>
   Tubbs, whose team leads the WAC in free-throw percentage, said
he felt the game actually ran true to form.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shoot free throws pretty well,'' he said. ``And we shot
about as well from the floor (.348 percent) as everyone else does.
They're a tough, physical team, and people have trouble shooting
against them. It's hard to shoot with 210 pounds draped over you.''
</P>
<P>
   During regulation, the Eagles outshot TCU from the field and
held a wide rebounding edge, although both figures diminished in
the late stages. For the game, Eastern Michigan outrebounded TCU,
53-49, had 21 assists to just 12 for the Frogs and had 19 more
field goals, but still lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started fouling out,'' Barnes said, ``we got
smaller.''
</P>
<P>
   Although TCU had five players in double figures _ including
Marquise Gainous, Estell Laster and Larry Allaway with 20 each _
the Eagles led through most of the second half and seemed to have
survived a comeback by the Frogs when Craig Erquhart tied Gainous
up on the baseline with 15 seconds left in an 85-83 game.
</P>
<P>
   But Thomas McTyer stole EMU's inbounds pass and flipped it to
Allaway, who was fouled by Alvin Howard with 12.5 second left.
Allaway _ playing despite a stomach virus _ hit both shots to send
it into overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``How big was that?'' Tubbs said. ``Big big.''
</P>
<P>
   By this time, EMU's Calvin Warner (21 points, 10 rebounds) had
fouled out, but the Eagles tied the game early in the second
overtime at 92 on C.J. Grantham's two free throws with six seconds
left.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Eagles had finally run out of gas. TCU jumped
quickly to a four-point lead in the second overtime and doggedly
held on. With the score 103-101 with 30 seconds remaining, Laster
and Myron Anthony dropped in the last four free throws, and it was
finally over.

POLA NAMED USC RUNNING BACKS COACH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Former USC fullback Kennedy Pola has been hired as
the Trojans' new running backs coach.
</P>
<P>
   Pola, 36, played fullback and linebacker at USC from 1982-86. He
spent the past season as the linebackers coach at San Diego State.
He was the running backs coach at Colorado from 1997-98, and was at
San Diego State from '94-96.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know SC is a pressure place and I like to be challenged in
my profession,'' Pola said. ``I think I need a challenge. I don't
mind being nervous or held accountable. This is my alma mater and I
have a passion for coaching running backs. It's that simple.''
</P>
<P>
   USC coach Paul Hackett said he will complete his coaching staff
by Friday. The remaining position _ tight ends coach _ could go to
graduate assistant Phil Pettey, who has applied for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Cash expected to sign: Cornerback Chris Cash of Palomar Junior
College (5-foot-11, 180 pounds) is expected to sign his
letter-of-intent today with the Trojans. He is believed to be good
enough to challenge for a starting position next season.

<TEXT>
<P>
   A paradox attends the parliamentary election in Russia this
Sunday. The issue that most concerns people outside Russia _ the
war in Chechnya _ is barely a matter for discussion among either
the candidates or the voters.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of country can hold a general election without
discussing a civil war whose needless brutality horrifies most
decent outsiders?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, of course, is a strange country, perhaps a uniquely
strange country.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the European states (bar Yugoslavia) that sloughed off
communism ten years ago, Russia has made the most uncertain
progress towards adopting democracy and the standards of behavior
usually associated with it.
</P>
<P>
   All the country's mainstream parties back the war, most of them
uncritically. The prime minister, Vladimir Putin, who has a beady
eye on the presidency due to fall vacant in the middle of next
year, has won popularity for his vigorous quest for military
victory.
</P>
<P>
   That the Chechens are unpopular is not surprising; they have all
too often lived up to their reputation for cruelty and violence,
now tinged with Islamic extremism.
</P>
<P>
   That Russians are concerned about terrorism and want to keep
their country intact is also understandable. Yet in most democratic
societies there would be protests about the indiscriminate and
disproportionate response of the Russian army to the Chechen
challenge; and, especially during an election campaign, there would
be debate about how to end the war.
</P>
<P>
   Not, it seems, in Russia. Few Russians seem even to question the
proposition that the only solution is the bloody reconquest of
Chechnya and the subjugation of its people.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps just as odd has been the virtual absence of serious
debate about policies of any other kind. Reform of Russia's
dreadful economy _ smaller now than that of the Netherlands _ has,
for instance, barely been mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist Party on the left and assorted nationalists on the
Slavophile right would plainly like to recreate some kind of
Russian empire, though it is unclear how they would do it.
</P>
<P>
   Cynicism abounds, especially about the corrupt new order that
has replaced the coercively deadening old one. It is matched by
dismay at the degradation into which Russia has sunk, even though
most Russians _ Communists included _ know that a return to a
Soviet-style past is unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   The electoral contest has, for the most part, been a matter of
dirty money, wild promises, defamation of character and the
promotion, with varying degrees of slickness and sophistication, of
personalities devoid of policies.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder then that the new Duma, the lower house of parliament,
will probably be much like the fairly awful old one.
</P>
<P>
   Though many of its deputies, led by the Communists, have been
hostile to President Boris Yeltsin, they have never quite collected
enough votes to impeach and oust him _ or the guts to risk losing
their seats in the process.
</P>
<P>
   The Communists look set, once again, to gain the largest block
of seats, perhaps a fifth of the total. As before, out-and-out
reformers and liberals will do badly.
</P>
<P>
   As before, the pattern of new alignments will not emerge until
independents start to show their colors; though half the seats are
filled by parties competing on national lists, the other half, in
first-past-the-post constituencies, will contain many candidates,
especially from the remoter regions, whose allegiances will be
uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, since the Duma's powers are weak compared with the
president's, the election is unlikely to produce a sudden dramatic
change in the way Russia is run.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Duma matters. It is supposed to make, scrutinize and
revise laws, in tandem with the president. It is supposed to draw
up a budget. It can sack prime ministers and reject new ones
proposed by the president. It can refuse to sign treaties. It can
stir up xenophobia and anti-western feeling, and generally be a
thorough nuisance.
</P>
<P>
   But the main point of interest in Sunday's voting is what it
will indicate about the summer's presidential election _ and about
the sort of Russia that the world is likely to have to deal with in
the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, any Communist success on Sunday will not be a guide
to next summer's race: the Communists' leader, Gennady Zyuganov,
looks incapable of extending his reach beyond a large minority of
resentful nostalgists.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the presidential candidates whose popularity will be
tested in Sunday's vote are Putin and Yevgeny Primakov, a former
prime minister (and, like the incumbent, also a former KGB man).
</P>
<P>
   Putin is standing above the Duma fray, though he has blessed a
small party called Unity; he is also Yeltsin's anointed heir.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov's Fatherland-All Russia party, backed by Moscow's
powerful mayor, Yuri Luzhkov, has no big policy differences with
Yeltsin or Putin. But a Putin presidency would be likely, all the
same, to differ from a Primakov one.
</P>
<P>
   As prime minister, Putin has concentrated entirely, and with
chilling ruthlessness, on Chechnya. He has ties with some leading
economic reformers, and many businessmen think he might not be bad,
even if, as liberals fear, he sought to be a Russian Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the corrupt coterie around Yeltsin hope Putin would
protect them if he won. His fortunes, however, hinge entirely on
the outcome of the war _ his war _ in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov is in poor health. He is tough and canny, and unlikely
to pursue reform with any zeal. But he might, as he did when he was
prime minister, try to bring down some of the more outrageous
business ``oligarchs'' who have so corrupted Russian politics.
</P>
<P>
   Both men might cooperate better with the Duma than Yeltsin has
done. Both would bring a new sense of authority to the Kremlin
after years of erratic behavior alternating with drift.
</P>
<P>
   But both suffer from that grievous Russian fault _ of seeing
politics, at home and abroad, as a zero-sum game in which any gain
for one side inevitably involves a loss, or even a humiliation, for
the other. Both might well make mischief in the world, threaten
neighbors and oppress regions seeking greater autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   In sum, neither would be easy for the West. What the current
campaign has most painfully brought out is Russia's moral and
political vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   For sure, a multi-party election, however crass, is infinitely
better than the tyranny that went before. But Russia is still far
from being a normal country.
</P>
<P>
   Its tragedy, after centuries of autocracy and 74 years of
mass-murder and ideological lunacy, is that too few of its people
realize that democracy and market economics alike can thrive only
if civic values _ honesty, equality before the law, a modicum of
compassion _ are nurtured at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the members of the Duma, old or new, nor Putin or
Primakov, let alone Yeltsin, understand that. Until they do, Russia
will remain horrible _ especially to its own people, the Chechens
foremost among them. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   It is tempting to dismiss this week's bash in Panama as the
first of many pointless parties for which the world is bracing
itself over the next fortnight.
</P>
<P>
   At least, that appears to be how the Clinton administration
wants it to be seen. Neither the president himself nor any of his
senior officials could find the time to be present when the United
States formally handed over ownership and operation of the Panama
Canal to the host country, fulfilling the terms of a treaty signed
in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   That is a shame. Admittedly, the United States' withdrawal has
been gradual, and Panama will not take charge of the canal until
Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the main reason behind the sudden diary clashes _
which caused even the secretary of state to be absent _ is that the
Panama Canal Treaty is scarcely more popular today in the United
States than when it was approved by the Senate by just one vote.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the handover warn of multiple threats to the canal.
They are worried that it will fall under Chinese control, and that
its operation will be jeopardized by Colombian guerrillas or drug
traffickers _ or, to be blunt, Panamanians.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it is only ten years ago this month that the United
States sent thousands of troops to invade Panama to topple the
unpleasant and undemocratic (though not especially threatening)
regime of General Manuel Antonio Noriega.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these worries are fantasies or the bogus fears of
partisan Republicans in Congress. Take the ``Chinese threat.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Panama leased the operation of container ports at each
end of the canal to Hutchison Whampoa, a Hong-Kong-based
multinational whose biggest shareholder is a friend of China's
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, Panama has no diplomatic relations with China (it
recognizes Taiwan), and Hutchison is a capitalist firm with no say
in the canal's operation. But even if it had one, and was a tool of
the Chinese, so what?
</P>
<P>
   As a big user of the canal, China shares with the United States
an interest in making sure it works efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's guerrillas may seem a more genuine threat. On Dec.
12, they chose to draw attention to themselves by attacking a
Colombian navy base close to the Panamanian border, reportedly
killing 45 troops.
</P>
<P>
   But that border is in remote jungle, some 300 kilometers (190
miles) from the canal. It has long been subject to incursions by
all sides in Colombia's wars _ with no discernible effect on the
canal.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, if there ever were a serious threat to the canal, the
1978 treaty would allow the United States to intervene. In fact,
there are two big reasons to welcome this week's handover _ as well
as one genuine worry.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Canal Zone and its military bases were a colonial
oddity, an affront to Panamanian and Latin American nationalism _
even if Panama's birth as a nation in 1903 was decisively assisted
by the United States for its own canal-building purposes, even if
its sense of nationhood is still a bit vague, and even if many
Panamanians now lament the loss of jobs at the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Second, if the canal is to remain competitive in a world of
bigger ships, cheap air freight and potential alternatives (such as
a canal project in Nicaragua), it requires big investment,
especially to modernize and widen its huge locks.
</P>
<P>
   It is more likely to get that as a Panamanian business than as a
distant but cosseted outpost of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there is no reason to doubt the ability of Panama's
officials to manage the canal (they have had plenty of practice).
Yet there are grounds for worry about whether the country's
politicians will let them do so.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade, Panama has made progress towards becoming
a stable democracy. But corruption is still widespread, perhaps
more so even than it was under General Noriega.
</P>
<P>
   The danger is that Panama's politicians will seek to milk the
canal's toll revenues and the assets the Americans are leaving
behind. Panama now has a big interest in making sure that this does
not happen, and so does the rest of the world. &QL;

   ``I feel about airplanes the way I feel about diets. They are
wonderful things for other people to go on,'' Jean Kerr, an
American dramatist, once quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Flying has become safer, faster and cheaper, but it seems ever
more stressful. Having successfully fought for increased
competition, to cut airfares, The Economist has now shifted its
attention to relieving the stress.
</P>
<P>
   One frequent cause is the noise that children, especially bored
ones, inflict on other travellers.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, we proposed that all planes should have child-free
zones, just like no-smoking zones: children (and parents) should be
confined to the back of the plane. As yet, sadly, no airline seems
to agree that children should be screened and not heard.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred, we would like to raise another case of what
economists call a negative externality: i.e., something which is
nice for you but imposes costs on others. This is excessive
carry-on luggage.
</P>
<P>
   In America six out of ten passengers now take a suitcase on to a
flight, rather than check it in, three times as many as in 1990.
The result is delay, because flights take longer to board.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers trying to squeeze 3-foot suitcases into 2-foot
overhead bins hold up people trying to board behind them. Some
travellers have tried to take refrigerators, television sets and
even a stuffed moose head on board.
</P>
<P>
   The problems of both children and luggage could be solved in one
stroke by putting the children in the hold, to make more space for
carry-on luggage. But that, we concede, might be unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, to reduce delays, most airlines are rightly imposing
stricter limits on the size or weight of bags that can be carried
on to planes.
</P>
<P>
   This has provoked outrage as passengers are forcibly separated
from their belongings at check-in. Understandably: if you put
luggage in the hold, you have to wait ages for it at the other end
_ if it shows up at all.
</P>
<P>
   Once you have experienced the nightmare of waiting at the
luggage carousel until it stops, with no sign of the suitcase you
checked in, it is clear why people prefer to lug their cases on
board.
</P>
<P>
   You took a flight from London to Tokyo; your luggage and your
smart clothes decided to hop on one to Los Angeles. Not an
externality, but certainly negative.
</P>
<P>
   In America only 0.5 percent of bags go missing, but if you are a
frequent traveller that risk is too high.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of 150 frequent fliers found that two-thirds had
experienced some sort of delay or loss to their luggage in the
previous 12 months. And if luggage remains lost, your likely
compensation is paltry _ a maximum of $1,250 in America, regardless
of whether your clothes were bought at Wal-Mart or Armani.
</P>
<P>
   If airlines are to restrict carry-ons, therefore, they also need
to offer better compensation for delayed or lost luggage. At the
least they should extend frequent-flier miles to luggage as well as
its owner: if your suitcase travels to Tokyo via Los Angeles, you
should get triple frequent-flier miles.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, passengers could be made to pay if they want to
take extra luggage on board.
</P>
<P>
   Better still, given the frequent positive correlation between
the size of the traveller and the weight of his (yes, his)
carry-on, why not take a tip from Papua New Guinea?
</P>
<P>
   When flying within the country, a passenger used to be weighed
along with his luggage before boarding the plane. Fight the flab
and you can bring your bag on board. Airplanes and diets would then
indeed be closely connected. &QL;

<P>
   Defeated armies, like the Russians who limped out of Chechnya in
1996, eventually work out where they went wrong and _ as the
unfortunate Chechens are now discovering _ try to do better next
time.
</P>
<P>
   But military planners who reckon they have won, like the
Americans who oversaw NATO's air war against Serbia, have less
incentive to reexamine their assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   In the six months since Yugoslavia's President Slobodan
Milosevic sued for peace, hundreds of thousands of words have been
penned on the military ``lessons of Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   But to the dismay of more radical thinkers in the world of
defense, there is little sign of nettles therefore being grasped,
or vested interests faced down.
</P>
<P>
   There are some features of NATO's 78-day war that every
chronicler agrees on. So long as the definition of success is kept
fairly elastic, this was the first war in history to be won by air
power alone. The winning side lost no men killed in action and
suffered very few other losses; only two manned aircraft were shot
down.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, it took much longer, and much more firepower,
to bring President Milosevic to heel than NATO's political masters
had originally expected, so the Pentagon had to scramble hard to
increase the number of aircraft and missiles used against Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   This tempted a man as usually sensible as Mikhail Gorbachev to
say, late in the war, that regardless of the eventual peace terms
the moral victor would be Serbia, simply because it had held out
for so long against so powerful a coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Pentagon, in its most self-congratulatory moments, has
acknowledged that the campaign against Serbia did expose some
weaknesses. The credibility of its claim to be able to conduct two
big local wars at roughly the same time looks distinctly strained,
to say the least.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Pentagon was only just able to field enough
``jammers'' _ aircraft which use electronics to suppress enemy air
defenses _ to keep the skies safe for its own bombers and those of
its low-tech allies.
</P>
<P>
   As Anthony Cordesman, of the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, points out in a forthcoming book, Serbia
could have posed a much more deadly threat if it had called on
Russia's best technology by using S-300 surface-to-air missiles.
Future adversaries will take the point.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a broad consensus on the weapons that saved the
day for NATO. Two sorts of satellite-guided bomb _ one cheap, the
other expensive, and both in embarrassingly short supply _ have
been singled out for laurels.
</P>
<P>
   One is the JDAM or Joint Direct Attack Munition, a device
costing around $20,000 which can be strapped on to a ``dumb bomb''
to give it deadly accuracy. The other is the Tomahawk land-attack
cruise missile, which can accurately deliver explosive power from
1,000 nautical miles out to sea, at $1 million a shot.
</P>
<P>
   The other technological star of the war was the UAV, the
unmanned aerial vehicle, which in Kosovo was used only for
reconnaissance but can almost certainly be used for more violent
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the UAVs could loiter over dangerous areas without
risk to human life or at unbearable economic cost (they are only $3
million apiece) was of huge value. Up to 15 of these gallant
machines made the ultimate sacrifice. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   So much for the winners. Among the losers cited by the Center
for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, another Washington
think-tank, is the whole principle of ``tactical air power'' _ the
powerful but relatively small and short-range fighters and bombers
which have to be deployed, maintained and protected at far-flung
bases around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The effectiveness of giant bombers based in the United States,
such as the B-2, is on the other hand offered as evidence that this
was a pretty good war for air power of the longer-range sort.
</P>
<P>
   Others agree with this assessment. Yet the supporters of ``tac
air'' remain robust. The Pentagon is still preparing to spend more
than $300 billion on three new types of tactical aircraft: the
F-22, which is one of the Air Force's pet projects, the Navy's
FA-18 E/F, and the Joint Strike Fighter which will serve all the
services.
</P>
<P>
   There have, however, been some signs of a political backlash in
Congress against ``tac air.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Lewis, a Republican congressman whose half-desert district
contains weapons-testing sites, led a successful move in October to
stop the first procurement money for the F-22. He would rather
spend the cash on more research.
</P>
<P>
   The fact remains that all these aircraft-building programs are
backed by powerful lobbies in the armed forces, as well as by
legislators whose districts contain the factories which make the
fighter-bombers.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that there is little evidence that defense
planners are taking to heart what is perhaps the chief lesson of
Kosovo. That would mean questioning the whole logic of
manpower-intensive weapons systems such as fighter-bombers.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kosovo fight, the average $50 million tactical bomber
which took off from an airfield in, say, Italy to drop its deadly
load over Serbia had to be accompanied by a ``strike package'' of
electronic-warfare aircraft and refuelling planes as well as
interceptors to protect it from enemy fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Teams of highly trained rescuers had to be at the ready to
recover pilots if they were shot down. And the tactical bombers
that were not operating from land bases needed billion-dollar
aircraft carriers to get them close enough to where the war was.
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining and protecting all these forces at overseas bases
was such an expensive and politically sensitive business that it
apparently makes sense for the American Air Force to send
$2-billion, two-man B-2 bombers, each of which can drop up to 32
big bombs or missiles, directly from the United States to anywhere
in the world, and then have them fly home again.
</P>
<P>
   Avoiding casualties is a costly business. So would it not be a
good idea to put some of the money instead into the development of
unmanned aerial vehicles which can do everything a piloted aircraft
can? &QL;

   The Kosovo war poses a similar challenge to naval planners. If
the main purpose of sea power is to deliver explosives to targets
on land, is there not some cheaper way of doing it than building
aircraft carriers which cost $5 billion each, and need an armada of
other ships to protect them?
</P>
<P>
   An alternative exists in the idea of small ``arsenal ships''
which could be packed with every known type of projectile, and yet
need a crew of only 50 (compared with a big carrier's 5,000) and
cost only about $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   But so far the Navy has shown hardly any interest in these
deadly little boats. It plans to build up to 30 small new
destroyers, which need fewer men than the existing sort; but this
is only half a step forward. And it still intends to build three
new carriers. &QL;

<P>
   Defeated armies, like the Russians who limped out of Chechnya in
1996, eventually work out where they went wrong and _ as the
unfortunate Chechens are now discovering _ try to do better next
time.
</P>
<P>
   But military planners who reckon they have won, like the
Americans who oversaw NATO's air war against Serbia, have less
incentive to reexamine their assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   In the six months since Yugoslavia's President Slobodan
Milosevic sued for peace, hundreds of thousands of words have been
penned on the military ``lessons of Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   But to the dismay of more radical thinkers in the world of
defense, there is little sign of nettles therefore being grasped,
or vested interests faced down.
</P>
<P>
   There are some features of NATO's 78-day war that every
chronicler agrees on. So long as the definition of success is kept
fairly elastic, this was the first war in history to be won by air
power alone. The winning side lost no men killed in action and
suffered very few other losses; only two manned aircraft were shot
down.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, it took much longer, and much more firepower,
to bring President Milosevic to heel than NATO's political masters
had originally expected, so the Pentagon had to scramble hard to
increase the number of aircraft and missiles used against Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   This tempted a man as usually sensible as Mikhail Gorbachev to
say, late in the war, that regardless of the eventual peace terms
the moral victor would be Serbia, simply because it had held out
for so long against so powerful a coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Pentagon, in its most self-congratulatory moments, has
acknowledged that the campaign against Serbia did expose some
weaknesses. The credibility of its claim to be able to conduct two
big local wars at roughly the same time looks distinctly strained,
to say the least.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Pentagon was only just able to field enough
``jammers'' _ aircraft which use electronics to suppress enemy air
defenses _ to keep the skies safe for its own bombers and those of
its low-tech allies.
</P>
<P>
   As Anthony Cordesman, of the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, points out in a forthcoming book, Serbia
could have posed a much more deadly threat if it had called on
Russia's best technology by using S-300 surface-to-air missiles.
Future adversaries will take the point.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a broad consensus on the weapons that saved the
day for NATO. Two sorts of satellite-guided bomb _ one cheap, the
other expensive, and both in embarrassingly short supply _ have
been singled out for laurels.
</P>
<P>
   One is the JDAM or Joint Direct Attack Munition, a device
costing around $20,000 which can be strapped on to a ``dumb bomb''
to give it deadly accuracy. The other is the Tomahawk land-attack
cruise missile, which can accurately deliver explosive power from
1,000 nautical miles out to sea, at $1 million a shot.
</P>
<P>
   The other technological star of the war was the UAV, the
unmanned aerial vehicle, which in Kosovo was used only for
reconnaissance but can almost certainly be used for more violent
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the UAVs could loiter over dangerous areas without
risk to human life or at unbearable economic cost (they are only $3
million apiece) was of huge value. Up to 15 of these gallant
machines made the ultimate sacrifice. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 475 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 575) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So much for the winners. Among the losers cited by the Center
for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, another Washington
think-tank, is the whole principle of ``tactical air power'' _ the
powerful but relatively small and short-range fighters and bombers
which have to be deployed, maintained and protected at far-flung
bases around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The effectiveness of giant bombers based in the United States,
such as the B-2, is on the other hand offered as evidence that this
was a pretty good war for air power of the longer-range sort.
</P>
<P>
   Others agree with this assessment. Yet the supporters of ``tac
air'' remain robust. The Pentagon is still preparing to spend more
than $300 billion on three new types of tactical aircraft: the
F-22, which is one of the Air Force's pet projects, the Navy's
FA-18 E/F, and the Joint Strike Fighter which will serve all the
services.
</P>
<P>
   There have, however, been some signs of a political backlash in
Congress against ``tac air.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Lewis, a Republican congressman whose half-desert district
contains weapons-testing sites, led a successful move in October to
stop the first procurement money for the F-22. He would rather
spend the cash on more research.
</P>
<P>
   The fact remains that all these aircraft-building programs are
backed by powerful lobbies in the armed forces, as well as by
legislators whose districts contain the factories which make the
fighter-bombers.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that there is little evidence that defense
planners are taking to heart what is perhaps the chief lesson of
Kosovo. That would mean questioning the whole logic of
manpower-intensive weapons systems such as fighter-bombers.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kosovo fight, the average $50 million tactical bomber
which took off from an airfield in, say, Italy to drop its deadly
load over Serbia had to be accompanied by a ``strike package'' of
electronic-warfare aircraft and refuelling planes as well as
interceptors to protect it from enemy fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Teams of highly trained rescuers had to be at the ready to
recover pilots if they were shot down. And the tactical bombers
that were not operating from land bases needed billion-dollar
aircraft carriers to get them close enough to where the war was.
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining and protecting all these forces at overseas bases
was such an expensive and politically sensitive business that it
apparently makes sense for the American Air Force to send
$2-billion, two-man B-2 bombers, each of which can drop up to 32
big bombs or missiles, directly from the United States to anywhere
in the world, and then have them fly home again.
</P>
<P>
   Avoiding casualties is a costly business. So would it not be a
good idea to put some of the money instead into the development of
unmanned aerial vehicles which can do everything a piloted aircraft
can? &QL;

<P>
   There must have been plenty of times over the years, given what
the world now knows about them, when Hillary Rodham Clinton dreamed
of putting some distance between herself and her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as her campaign to become a senator for New York gathers
pace, she is at last getting a chance to fulfil that dream.
</P>
<P>
   She is spending more time living in the state that she hopes to
represent; and she is also putting some light between herself and
her presidential husband on a growing range of issues, from the
economic (federal subsidies for New York hospitals) to the highly
emotional (the ``Don't ask, don't tell'' policy for homosexuals in
the American armed forces).
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's candidacy is drawing attention for all sorts of
reasons. For one thing, she is the first presidential spouse to
move on from her husband's penumbra to run for office in her own
right.
</P>
<P>
   She is also a polarizing personality who is engaged in one of
the most delicate political operations imaginable, creating a
distance from her husband without opening up a rift with him.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest reason for the interest is that people think
that her campaign may finally reveal the solution to a conundrum
that has puzzled America for years.
</P>
<P>
   Is Mrs. Clinton the real power behind the throne, the brains,
backbone and guts of the Bill-and-Hillary partnership, as many in
her camp have long argued? Or is she a free-rider, a woman who
could never make it on her own, but who has used her husband's
political genius to exercise power without accountability?
</P>
<P>
   So far the auguries do not look good for the Hillary camp. Her
belated discovery that she is a Yankees baseball fan served only to
emphasize her status as a carpetbagger. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (100-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 200) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Her attempts to pander to New York's militant minorities have
repeatedly backfired, most famously when she endorsed her husband's
pardon of a bunch of Puerto Rican nationalists, only to backpedal
later.
</P>
<P>
   Then, more recently, she declared that she wants to march in the
St. Patrick's Day parade, only to learn that New York's gays are
locked in a furious dispute with the parade's organizers.
</P>
<P>
   She is also treading on dangerous ground when she accuses
Rudolph Giuliani, New York's mayor and her likely competitor for
the Senate, of ``criminalizing the homeless.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 100-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers may not be as hard-hearted as they like to appear.
But they do not want to go back to the days when the streets were a
panhandler's paradise.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Mrs. Clinton's fumblings result from her ambiguous
status, part official figure, part candidate. Jewish groups
lambasted her for sitting in silence while Yasser Arafat's wife
launched into an anti-Israeli rant. But as first lady she has
learned that silence is usually the best course.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Giuliani has accused her official airplane _ a small
15-seater _ of delaying regular commercial traffic at La Guardia
Airport, and his supporters have repeatedly bitched about her
Secret Service guards. But for the country's first lady a retinue
is not an optional extra.
</P>
<P>
   Other fumblings can be explained by the fact that she is a
newcomer to New York's high-voltage politics. Yet a glance at her
past suggests that in fact her problems go deeper than this.
</P>
<P>
   From her decision to keep her maiden name when she got married
(despite the fact that she was living in Arkansas), to her
dismissal of women who stay at home and bake cookies, she has
repeatedly revealed a tin ear for politics.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton was responsible for one of the great policy fiascos
of recent decades: an elaborate plan to reorganize America's
health-care system that was meant to be the centerpiece of the
first Clinton administration but, for lack of political
preparation, died as soon as it reached Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   On the scandal front, she was up to her elbows in Travelgate and
Filegate. And it was Mrs. Clinton's stonewalling over Whitewater
that led to Kenneth Starr's investigation and, by extension, to the
whole impeachment fiasco.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton is one of the best public speakers in the business.
She is also relentlessly organized and focused. (Even a casual
meeting with her elicits a note about how good it was to meet you.)
</P>
<P>
   In the White House's darkest moments it has usually been Mrs.
Clinton who has organized the defenses and stiffened the troops'
morale.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1998 she stormed across the country boosting
endangered candidates, raising money for her party and lambasting
the ``right-wing conspiracy'' _ carrying the banner, indeed, while
her husband stayed in the shadows.
</P>
<P>
   Yet she lacks two qualities that her husband possesses in
spades. The first is a capacity for moral ambiguity. Mrs. Clinton
not only disagrees with her opponents. She regards them as moral
reprobates _ members of a great reactionary plot that must be
fought at all costs.
</P>
<P>
   Her second lack is the human touch. Mrs. Clinton's tin ear is
the result of her deep lack of interest in people, at least as
living, feeling individuals.
</P>
<P>
   It never occurred to her during the health-care battle that, in
dealing with politicians, you need to stroke their egos as well as
dazzle them with your intellect. And she is even less sympathetic
when it comes to dealing with what one citizen of her newly adopted
home state once referred to as ``the little people.''
</P>
<P>
   One Clintonologist argues that she has ``a high usefulness
quotient'' _ it is only useful people she cozies up to.
</P>
<P>
   ``She never offered us a cup of coffee,'' complained one member
of her police detail back in the Arkansas days. ``She was like a
robot. Her actions were that way to anybody who wasn't on her
level. You were just in her way.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the debate about who is the real power in the
Clinton partnership is that it misses the point: they both are.
</P>
<P>
   The crises that have punctuated the president's career have
repeatedly underlined how much Bill needs Hillary's backbone and
moral absolutism. Now the first lady's fumblings in New York are
underlining how much Hillary needs Bill's political instincts.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since they met at Yale in 1970 they have been one of the
great political partnerships, held together by their differences.
But an ex-president is hardly likely to make a new career as a
campaign manager; and Mrs. Clinton can hardly become a political
player in her own right if she is seen as her husband's cat's-paw.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton's great good fortune was that he could make his
career as the front man of a partnership. Mrs. Clinton's great
problem is that, to succeed, she has to leave that partnership
behind. &QL;

   Is Mrs. Clinton the real power behind the throne, the brains,
backbone and guts of the Bill-and-Hillary partnership, as many in
her camp have long argued? Or is she a free-rider, a woman who
could never make it on her own, but who has used her husband's
political genius to exercise power without accountability?
</P>
<P>
   So far the auguries do not look good for the Hillary camp. Her
belated discovery that she is a Yankees baseball fan served only to
emphasize her status as a carpetbagger. &QL;

 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Her attempts to pander to New York's militant minorities have
repeatedly backfired, most famously when she endorsed her husband's
pardon of a bunch of Puerto Rican nationalists, only to backpedal
later.
</P>
<P>
   Then, more recently, she declared that she wants to march in the
St. Patrick's Day parade, only to learn that New York's gays are
locked in a furious dispute with the parade's organizers.
</P>
<P>
   She is also treading on dangerous ground when she accuses
Rudolph Giuliani, New York's mayor and her likely competitor for
the Senate, of ``criminalizing the homeless.'' &QL;

<P>
   New Yorkers may not be as hard-hearted as they like to appear.
But they do not want to go back to the days when the streets were a
panhandler's paradise.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Mrs. Clinton's fumblings result from her ambiguous
status, part official figure, part candidate. Jewish groups
lambasted her for sitting in silence while Yasser Arafat's wife
launched into an anti-Israeli rant. But as first lady she has
learned that silence is usually the best course.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Giuliani has accused her official airplane _ a small
15-seater _ of delaying regular commercial traffic at La Guardia
Airport, and his supporters have repeatedly bitched about her
Secret Service guards. But for the country's first lady a retinue
is not an optional extra.
</P>
<P>
   Other fumblings can be explained by the fact that she is a
newcomer to New York's high-voltage politics. Yet a glance at her
past suggests that in fact her problems go deeper than this.
</P>
<P>
   From her decision to keep her maiden name when she got married
(despite the fact that she was living in Arkansas), to her
dismissal of women who stay at home and bake cookies, she has
repeatedly revealed a tin ear for politics.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton was responsible for one of the great policy fiascos
of recent decades: an elaborate plan to reorganize America's
health-care system that was meant to be the centerpiece of the
first Clinton administration but, for lack of political
preparation, died as soon as it reached Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   On the scandal front, she was up to her elbows in Travelgate and
Filegate. And it was Mrs. Clinton's stonewalling over Whitewater
that led to Kenneth Starr's investigation and, by extension, to the
whole impeachment fiasco.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton is one of the best public speakers in the business.
She is also relentlessly organized and focused. (Even a casual
meeting with her elicits a note about how good it was to meet you.)
</P>
<P>
   In the White House's darkest moments it has usually been Mrs.
Clinton who has organized the defenses and stiffened the troops'
morale.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1998 she stormed across the country boosting
endangered candidates, raising money for her party and lambasting
the ``right-wing conspiracy'' _ carrying the banner, indeed, while
her husband stayed in the shadows.
</P>
<P>
   Yet she lacks two qualities that her husband possesses in
spades. The first is a capacity for moral ambiguity. Mrs. Clinton
not only disagrees with her opponents. She regards them as moral
reprobates _ members of a great reactionary plot that must be
fought at all costs.
</P>
<P>
   Her second lack is the human touch. Mrs. Clinton's tin ear is
the result of her deep lack of interest in people, at least as
living, feeling individuals.
</P>
<P>
   It never occurred to her during the health-care battle that, in
dealing with politicians, you need to stroke their egos as well as
dazzle them with your intellect. And she is even less sympathetic
when it comes to dealing with what one citizen of her newly adopted
home state once referred to as ``the little people.''
</P>
<P>
   One Clintonologist argues that she has ``a high usefulness
quotient'' _ it is only useful people she cozies up to.
</P>
<P>
   ``She never offered us a cup of coffee,'' complained one member
of her police detail back in the Arkansas days. ``She was like a
robot. Her actions were that way to anybody who wasn't on her
level. You were just in her way.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the debate about who is the real power in the
Clinton partnership is that it misses the point: they both are.
</P>
<P>
   The crises that have punctuated the president's career have
repeatedly underlined how much Bill needs Hillary's backbone and
moral absolutism. Now the first lady's fumblings in New York are
underlining how much Hillary needs Bill's political instincts.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since they met at Yale in 1970 they have been one of the
great political partnerships, held together by their differences.
But an ex-president is hardly likely to make a new career as a
campaign manager; and Mrs. Clinton can hardly become a political
player in her own right if she is seen as her husband's cat's-paw.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton's great good fortune was that he could make his
career as the front man of a partnership. Mrs. Clinton's great
problem is that, to succeed, she has to leave that partnership
behind. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The shop is open, but you cannot get through the door
for the crowds flooding in from across the country. After you
finally squeeze inside, you have a question.
</P>
<P>
   A sales assistant asks you to write it down and tells you that
someone might reply _ after next Tuesday. You fill your shopping
basket anyway. At the till, however, the cashier removes several
items from your cart: ``Sorry, these are just for display. We are
sold out.''
</P>
<P>
   At home, you discover your credit card has been charged anyway _
twice, in fact. And, mysteriously, your bag contains things you
have never seen before.
</P>
<P>
   You go back to the store to complain. The sales assistant has no
memory of who you are or of what you bought. He suggests you
auction your unwanted purchases on eBay.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody would accept such treatment in a real shop. But Internet
shopping is blighted by overburdened Web sites without a precise
idea of their inventory, or of how to serve customers, or of when
deliveries will arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Last Christmas e-commerce was still a novelty, and customers
were willing to put up with all sorts of shortcomings. But with
sales expected to double to $6 billion this year, online shopping
is past being a prototype. Customers expect to be treated well.
</P>
<P>
   The industry has done everything in its power to raise their
expectations. The airwaves are echoing with jingles promising
perfect online shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Yet most online retailers are merely pretty facades. Their
priority is to create a buzz (what Web retailers dignify as ``brand
building'') so as to attract traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, only 5-20 percent of their investment goes on
merchandising, logistics and fulfillment, estimates Keng Lim, boss
of Escalate, which provides back-office systems for Internet
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Boo.com, a Swedish sports-fashion retailer, spent $100 million
on public relations and advertising before it had even freed its
Web site from bugs. Few Internet entrepreneurs have enough
retailing experience to build the logistics and customer management
that stand behind a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``God knows how often I have been in a room with a 27-year-old
guy who can dream up a fancy Web site, but hasn't a clue about the
complexities of the back office,'' scoffs Harold Hughes, of
Pandesic, which sells computer systems to Web merchants.
</P>
<P>
   This might seem hopelessly shortsighted. Yet, according to the
received wisdom of the Internet, building a business in such a
lopsided way might be the clever _ and possibly the only _ thing to
do.
</P>
<P>
   Most online retailers believe they are in a sprint to gain
market share over Christmas. Send.com, an upmarket gift site, has
spent $20 million on marketing in the past eight weeks _ five times
its original budget.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lannon, its chief executive, thinks the strategy is
sound: ``I look at this like an election campaign. If the election
is in December it doesn't make sense to say in January, I wish we
had spent more money.''
</P>
<P>
   Only the two or three firms with the largest sales in their
niche will be able to raise fresh money next year. The rest are
likely either to fail or to be bought.
</P>
<P>
   Perversely, even those that go bankrupt may succeed financially:
if a site has attracted a decent amount of traffic, a buyer may
think it worth enough to make its founders rich.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the approach is creating jerry-built companies.
PricewaterhouseCoopers, an accounting firm and consultancy, has
devised a measure of quality, called BetterWeb, which analyzes such
things as orders, returns and complaints.
</P>
<P>
   None of the 300 e-merchants it has surveyed passes muster.
Sometimes the lack of experience borders on naivete.
</P>
<P>
   Eve.com, a beauty-products site, tried to sell perfumes, only to
discover that these were classed as ``hazardous materials'' and
that to ship them via UPS required a license. That took months to
get.
</P>
<P>
   Most shortcomings are to do with computers and therefore harder
to fix. Even the best sites, such as eBay, are prone to crash or
are struggling to find skilled IT professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Others have fallen into the trap of buying software packages
that suited them when they were small, but which cannot be scaled
up to process larger volumes.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of Internet retailers racing towards Christmas have had
neither the time nor the money to build systems that can cope with
huge, unpredictable surges in web traffic.
</P>
<P>
   However, the most gruelling struggle is to tie together old
computer systems so as to link their Web sites to data banks and
warehouses. Only then can firms know what is in stock, guarantee
delivery times and let customers track orders.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Sharp, who left Microsoft to become the chief technology
officer at iTurf, a Web site and catalogue retailer for teenagers,
says that without integrated systems firms cannot assess what
people are doing on their site or the value of an advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lack of technical experience will show how flaky many of these
companies are,'' he says, adding that proper integration can take
years.
</P>
<P>
   Even if they get their computer systems right, most online
retailers are ill-prepared for the difficulties of handling
thousands or millions of small, frequent and individual orders. &QL;

<P>
   &UR; (350-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 875) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Take toysmart.com, which is based in Massachusetts and is
majority-owned by Disney. The site specializes in ``good,''
educational toys _ no Barbies or Pokemons here _ and has built and
equipped a 150,000-square-foot warehouse in less than four months.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to its chaotic headquarters in Waltham trip over staff
and children strewn across the floor happily ``testing'' lego sets,
wooden trains and science kits (a favorite ``raises'' live
butterflies).
</P>
<P>
   Toysmart, which did more business in the first 30 hours of
December this year than in the whole of December 1998, is spending
more on its back office than most of its rivals, and has hired IT
and warehousing professionals from GTE and LL Bean.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it has had its glitches _ or ``gotchas'' as David
Lord, the chief executive, calls them. Some of these are easily put
right: the firm bought a new bank of printers to keep up with
demand for individual labels.
</P>
<P>
   More serious have been mismatches between stock on the Web site
and in the warehouse, because of delays in gaining approval for
credit cards and in checking handpicked orders.
</P>
<P>
   Clever electronics cannot solve every back-office glitch.
Although toysmart's warehouse is full of gleaming packing machines
and conveyor belts, there are no robots here. Every order is
assembled by hand using a system of codes that even an experienced
packer says takes ``ages'' to master.
</P>
<P>
   Pandesic's Hughes says that to meet the Christmas rush, many Web
retailers are employing ``tattooed musclemen'' to handle their
orders.
</P>
<P>
   Even toysmart's Lord is pressing his family, board directors and
local mothers to pick and wrap orders.
</P>
<P>
   One solution is to outsource everything from customer service to
fulfillment. iTurf's chief executive, Steve Kahn, calls this
``dancing with the devil.'' He describes the group's flirtation
with outsourcing as a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   There tends to be a conflict of interest, because the service
firm is trying to cut costs, whereas the online retailer wants
additional resources. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>

   &UR; (END OF 350-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,350) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Handspring, which makes handheld computers, is paying the price.
Its customers are being billed several times, and many have been
unable to cancel orders.
</P>
<P>
   In the Christmas rush, sites are building incomplete systems.
Without tools for customizing pages, software that can identify
frequent customers or e-mail systems that help customers get quick
answers, sites will lose visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, once a system is in place, it is hard to slot in new
features. And that is the real lesson from all the bodging and
jerry-building.
</P>
<P>
   To succeed, online retailers need to construct more than just
bright Web sites made alluring by huge amounts of advertising. The
solution is to build top-notch distribution centers and warehouses.
But, as Amazon _ probably the best online retailer _ is
discovering, that is very expensive, indeed. &QL;

 c.1999 Economist Newspaper Ltd.  
 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The shop is open, but you cannot get through the door
for the crowds flooding in from across the country. After you
finally squeeze inside, you have a question.
</P>
<P>
   A sales assistant asks you to write it down and tells you that
someone might reply _ after next Tuesday. You fill your shopping
basket anyway. At the till, however, the cashier removes several
items from your cart: ``Sorry, these are just for display. We are
sold out.''
</P>
<P>
   At home, you discover your credit card has been charged anyway _
twice, in fact. And, mysteriously, your bag contains things you
have never seen before.
</P>
<P>
   You go back to the store to complain. The sales assistant has no
memory of who you are or of what you bought. He suggests you
auction your unwanted purchases on eBay.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody would accept such treatment in a real shop. But Internet
shopping is blighted by overburdened Web sites without a precise
idea of their inventory, or of how to serve customers, or of when
deliveries will arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Last Christmas e-commerce was still a novelty, and customers
were willing to put up with all sorts of shortcomings. But with
sales expected to double to $6 billion this year, online shopping
is past being a prototype. Customers expect to be treated well.
</P>
<P>
   The industry has done everything in its power to raise their
expectations. The airwaves are echoing with jingles promising
perfect online shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Yet most online retailers are merely pretty facades. Their
priority is to create a buzz (what Web retailers dignify as ``brand
building'') so as to attract traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, only 5-20 percent of their investment goes on
merchandising, logistics and fulfillment, estimates Keng Lim, boss
of Escalate, which provides back-office systems for Internet
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Boo.com, a Swedish sports-fashion retailer, spent $100 million
on public relations and advertising before it had even freed its
Web site from bugs. Few Internet entrepreneurs have enough
retailing experience to build the logistics and customer management
that stand behind a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``God knows how often I have been in a room with a 27-year-old
guy who can dream up a fancy Web site, but hasn't a clue about the
complexities of the back office,'' scoffs Harold Hughes, of
Pandesic, which sells computer systems to Web merchants.
</P>
<P>
   This might seem hopelessly shortsighted. Yet, according to the
received wisdom of the Internet, building a business in such a
lopsided way might be the clever _ and possibly the only _ thing to
do.
</P>
<P>
   Most online retailers believe they are in a sprint to gain
market share over Christmas. Send.com, an upmarket gift site, has
spent $20 million on marketing in the past eight weeks _ five times
its original budget.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lannon, its chief executive, thinks the strategy is
sound: ``I look at this like an election campaign. If the election
is in December it doesn't make sense to say in January, I wish we
had spent more money.''
</P>
<P>
   Only the two or three firms with the largest sales in their
niche will be able to raise fresh money next year. The rest are
likely either to fail or to be bought.
</P>
<P>
   Perversely, even those that go bankrupt may succeed financially:
if a site has attracted a decent amount of traffic, a buyer may
think it worth enough to make its founders rich.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the approach is creating jerry-built companies.
PricewaterhouseCoopers, an accounting firm and consultancy, has
devised a measure of quality, called BetterWeb, which analyzes such
things as orders, returns and complaints.
</P>
<P>
   None of the 300 e-merchants it has surveyed passes muster.
Sometimes the lack of experience borders on naivete.
</P>
<P>
   Eve.com, a beauty-products site, tried to sell perfumes, only to
discover that these were classed as ``hazardous materials'' and
that to ship them via UPS required a license. That took months to
get.
</P>
<P>
   Most shortcomings are to do with computers and therefore harder
to fix. Even the best sites, such as eBay, are prone to crash or
are struggling to find skilled IT professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Others have fallen into the trap of buying software packages
that suited them when they were small, but which cannot be scaled
up to process larger volumes.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of Internet retailers racing towards Christmas have had
neither the time nor the money to build systems that can cope with
huge, unpredictable surges in web traffic.
</P>
<P>
   However, the most gruelling struggle is to tie together old
computer systems so as to link their Web sites to data banks and
warehouses. Only then can firms know what is in stock, guarantee
delivery times and let customers track orders.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Sharp, who left Microsoft to become the chief technology
officer at iTurf, a Web site and catalogue retailer for teenagers,
says that without integrated systems firms cannot assess what
people are doing on their site or the value of an advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lack of technical experience will show how flaky many of these
companies are,'' he says, adding that proper integration can take
years.
</P>
<P>
   Even if they get their computer systems right, most online
retailers are ill-prepared for the difficulties of handling
thousands or millions of small, frequent and individual orders. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (350-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 875) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Take toysmart.com, which is based in Massachusetts and is
majority-owned by Disney. The site specializes in ``good,''
educational toys _ no Barbies or Pokemons here _ and has built and
equipped a 150,000-square-foot warehouse in less than four months.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to its chaotic headquarters in Waltham trip over staff
and children strewn across the floor happily ``testing'' lego sets,
wooden trains and science kits (a favorite ``raises'' live
butterflies).
</P>
<P>
   Toysmart, which did more business in the first 30 hours of
December this year than in the whole of December 1998, is spending
more on its back office than most of its rivals, and has hired IT
and warehousing professionals from GTE and LL Bean.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it has had its glitches _ or ``gotchas'' as David
Lord, the chief executive, calls them. Some of these are easily put
right: the firm bought a new bank of printers to keep up with
demand for individual labels.
</P>
<P>
   More serious have been mismatches between stock on the Web site
and in the warehouse, because of delays in gaining approval for
credit cards and in checking handpicked orders.
</P>
<P>
   Clever electronics cannot solve every back-office glitch.
Although toysmart's warehouse is full of gleaming packing machines
and conveyor belts, there are no robots here. Every order is
assembled by hand using a system of codes that even an experienced
packer says takes ``ages'' to master.
</P>
<P>
   Pandesic's Hughes says that to meet the Christmas rush, many Web
retailers are employing ``tattooed musclemen'' to handle their
orders.
</P>
<P>
   Even toysmart's Lord is pressing his family, board directors and
local mothers to pick and wrap orders.
</P>
<P>
   One solution is to outsource everything from customer service to
fulfillment. iTurf's chief executive, Steve Kahn, calls this
``dancing with the devil.'' He describes the group's flirtation
with outsourcing as a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   There tends to be a conflict of interest, because the service
firm is trying to cut costs, whereas the online retailer wants
additional resources. &QL;

<P>
   Has the millennium bug been crushed?
</P>
<P>
   The world must wait until Jan. 1 to see if all of those Y2K
projects have done the trick. But the nerds seem to have persuaded
us that disruption will not be serious and on New Millennium's Day,
life will carry on.
</P>
<P>
   That emerges from the latest world poll, carried out by Angus
Reid for The Economist. The Canadian polling firm interviewed
representative adult samples in 21 countries from mid-November to
early December _ nearly 12,000 respondents in all.
</P>
<P>
   We asked our sample group if they thought the bug would cause
``serious and widespread economic disruption'' in their country, or
``some economic disruption, but not serious'' or ``little or no
disruption.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 7 percent, weighted by population, said they had never
heard of the bug.
</P>
<P>
   Though practically everyone knew about it in, say, America and
Hong Kong, 32 percent of Russians and 29 percent of Turks professed
total ignorance.
</P>
<P>
   Others had heard of it, but were unsure of its likely
consequences. Overall, this was true of 6 percent of our sample.
</P>
<P>
   What follows ignores such answers and concentrates on the rest.
Globally, only 8 percent of those who have an opinion expect
widespread disruption in their own countries. However, a further 41
percent expect some economic damage.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, those expecting some trouble and those expecting none
are evenly balanced.
</P>
<P>
   The share of pessimists varies greatly. In America and Canada,
only 2 percent expect really serious trouble, as do 4 percent in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   However, widespread disruption is expected by 10 percent of
French, 12 percent of Japanese and 14 percent of Turks.
</P>
<P>
   Southeast Asia is also worried. In South Korea and Japan,
roughly three-quarters of those expressing a view expect at least
some damage.
</P>
<P>
   For the purposes of planning, what matters is how people behave.
Will they refuse to fly? Will they refuse to buy? Might many
confine themselves to the safety of their own homes (if safe they
be)?
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the proportion saying that they will avoid nothing is a
high 68 percent. Again, the figure conceals large variations. For
example, 90 percent of Spaniards and 89 percent of Italians plan to
carry on as normal. By contrast, that is true of only 52 percent of
South Koreans, and 53 percent of Egyptians.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, some businesses are going to take a hit _
especially airlines. When asked if there was anything they would
avoid on millennium day, around a fifth of Americans and Canadians
volunteered that they would refuse to fly, despite their optimism
in this poll.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, very few Italians and no Spaniards would not fly.
</P>
<P>
   Very few people anywhere say they will not drive, use elevators,
or travel on trains and the underground.
</P>
<P>
   Our poll prompts one thought. The reaction against genetically
modified food has led to talk of a crisis of public confidence in
science. People are no longer, it is said, ready to trust the
experts when they assure the world.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, for most people, the only reason to think that the bug is
safe is that experts say so. And, although events may prove the
scientists wrong, most people seem inclined to believe them.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently, people can still be persuaded by scientists, provided
it is done right. &QL;

point as blood tests, because some new research suggests that
depressed diabetics are, quite literally, prone to getting their
hearts broken.
</P>
<P>
   This study, which is to be published in January's
``Atherosclerosis'' by Trevor Orchard, an epidemiologist at the
University of Pittsburgh, is one piece of a mosaic that
psychologists and epidemiologists have been fitting together over
the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   Another piece is an answer to the question of why depressed
people seem particularly susceptible to infection.
</P>
<P>
   The picture that is emerging as the pieces fit together suggests
that the old tag ``a healthy mind in a healthy body'' frequently
needs to be inverted.
</P>
<P>
   An unhealthy mind can lead directly to an unhealthy body _ and
therefore another old medical tag ``treat the patient, not the
disease'' takes on a new significance.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Orchard explored this interaction between mind and body
using data collected during the Pittsburgh Epidemiology of Diabetes
Complications Study, which was designed to identify those factors
that worsen the health of people already suffering from diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   In ``juvenile-onset'' (type-I) diabetes, these complications can
be as deadly as the ailment itself. Type-I diabetics cannot produce
insulin _ a hormone which regulates the level of sugar in the
blood. They must therefore inject themselves with insulin at
regular intervals or else risk coma or sudden death.
</P>
<P>
   And, as if this were not sobering enough, type-I diabetics also
have a tendency to suffer from early and severe arteriosclerosis, a
condition in which the walls of the blood vessels thicken and
harden.
</P>
<P>
   Arteriosclerosis of the coronary arteries is particularly
dangerous, for these vessels supply blood to the muscle of the
heart. As the coronary-artery walls narrow, the flow of nutrients
and oxygen to the heart slows, and coronary heart disease (CHD)
follows.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Orchard's analysis involved more than 600 diabetics, who
were examined at two-year intervals over six years.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to undergoing the usual physiological tests, the
participants were also evaluated at the beginning of the study by
the ``Beck Depression Inventory.'' This test rates individual
symptoms of depression (such as pessimism, suicidal ideas, social
withdrawal and loss of libido).
</P>
<P>
   The more depressed a patient is, the more points he accumulates.
A patient's score on the Beck scale turned out to be a good
predictor of his eventual level of CHD _ better, indeed, than high
levels of blood sugar, the standard symptom of diabetic disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Those without CHD scored significantly lower than those with it.
And patients who developed angina, a painful heart condition
resulting from arteriosclerosis, had depression scores that were
nearly twice as high (12.2) as diabetics whose hearts stayed
healthy (6.6).
</P>
<P>
   Diabetics, of course, whether depressed or not, are seriously
ill people. But it has been known for a long time that people with
no serious illness other than depression are more likely to die
than those who are otherwise similar, but mentally healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Many of their causes of death have some visible connection with
their disease _ suicide, violent accidents and drug abuse are high
on the list. But depressed patients also die more often than the
mentally healthy from ``natural'' causes such as pneumonia and
influenza. &QL;

<P>
   The question of why severely depressed patients suffer from
infections more often than the average person attracted the
attention of Gregory Miller, a psychologist at Carnegie Mellon
University, also in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   In a normal body, infectious organisms are met by a battalion of
cells known as lymphocytes. Some of these attack the invaders
directly. Others produce antibodies that gum them up. But the
immune systems of the severely depressed tend to mount a weaker
counterattack than those of the mentally fit.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Miller and his colleagues think they have the explanation
for this immunological apathy. In the past, studies relating mental
depression to depression of the immune system have usually been
performed on patients stuck in hospital. This complicates matters,
because the mere fact of being in a hospital affects a patient's
mood and behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Dr. Miller studied 32 depressed women who were not in
hospital, and matched them with a control group of healthy women.
As he reports in the latest issue of ``Psychosomatic Medicine,''
lymphocytes from the depressed women responded much less than those
from the normal women when exposed to agents that induce
proliferation.
</P>
<P>
   One explanation for this relies on the observation that
depression is often accompanied by a hormonal imbalance in the
brain. The disease is associated with abnormal levels of
norepinephrine and estradiol, hormones that are known to help
regulate the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Miller's results, however, showed that this biochemical
difference could not, by itself, account for the weakness of the
responses shown to infection by the depressed women. There must be
something else involved.
</P>
<P>
   When he and his colleagues started examining the women in
question, they found that the depressed subjects had very different
ways of life from the controls. They smoked more, drank more
caffeinated drinks, slept more fitfully, and exercised less.
</P>
<P>
   But, perhaps surprisingly, only one of these differences, that
in physical activity, proved to have a significant relationship
with lymphocyte production. Dr. Miller found that physical activity
accounted for about half of the difference in immunity between
depressed and normal women.
</P>
<P>
   He believes that exercise represents the first clear behavioral
link between depression and a dysfunctional immune system.
</P>
<P>
   If that speculation proves correct, encouraging depressed people
to exercise should help to protect them from illness _ and the
strange correlations between depression, pneumonia and influenza
may finally make some sense. &QL;

   To assess a diabetic's risk of heart disease, a doctor typically
takes a blood sample to look for biochemical telltales such as the

<P>
   Witching hour approaches. Goblins and gremlins and ghouls will
set mischief loose in the world. Fear will add its chill to the
winds that sweep through the streets. With every sunset, solid
citizens know they're another day closer to... Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have a right to feel nervous. When it's time to roll
over to the double zeros of 2000, some computers won't make the
transition. Undiscovered software bugs will leave the poor machines
stuck in 1900 or hopelessly dithering over the date.
</P>
<P>
   In the worst-case scenario, automatic teller machines could
refuse to spit out cash, electrical utility grids could fail, and
entire industries could come to a halt when their computerized
inventory-control and manufacturing systems stop answering
commands.
</P>
<P>
   The chance that anything so cataclysmic might happen is small,
but real. The truth is that nobody knows for sure what will happen.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market hates uncertainty _ its inability to predict
whether or not the Federal Reserve Board will raise interest rates
a piddling 25 basis points is enough to send the indexes tumbling.
</P>
<P>
   So imagine the intensity of investor reaction to a genuinely
chilling possibility, no matter how remote.
</P>
<P>
   A stock such as Lucent Technologies fell 9 percent on July 20,
when Wall Street analysts decided that a passing remark by a
company executive about a possible slowdown in sales during the
quarter ending in December was a sign that the curse of Y2K had hit
the company.
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately it will pay more this winter to be attentive and
thoughtful than to be frightened, because Y2K will mean both tricks
and treats.
</P>
<P>
   For every company that shows lower sales and earnings, others
will report unexpectedly strong results.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. investors may decide to head for the sidelines, pulling
money out of financial markets in favor of the security of cash.
But foreign investors, especially those with money in emerging
markets, are likely to flee to the comparative safety of the U.S.
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Focusing on the tricks the Y2K bug may play on investors means
paying attention to only part of the story.
</P>
<P>
   Take a look at the auto industry. The big U.S.-based automakers
such as Ford and General Motors are exactly the kinds of companies
most susceptible to the bite of the year-2000 bug.
</P>
<P>
   They sit at the top of immensely long supply chains: Their
assembly lines require interior assemblies from Lear and body
frames from Tower Automotive, for example. Those suppliers rely on
even smaller suppliers for everything from screws to vinyl.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these parts are delivered by computerized just-in-time
inventory systems that try to keep parts on hand to a minimum. Any
disruption to that flow, and the computerized manufacturing systems
that churn out cars will grind to a halt for days or weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, auto executives know this _ and know that no matter
how rigorously they've tested their own internal systems the
carmakers are at the mercy of systems failures anywhere in the
supply chain.
</P>
<P>
   So what have these companies been doing? Well, they have asked
suppliers to ensure that their own systems are bug-free _ and
they've temporarily turned their just-in-time inventory systems
into just-in-case insurance policies by stockpiling larger than
normal supplies of critical components. Momentary glitches won't
shut this industry down.
</P>
<P>
   You'll see the same thing in industry after industry, with the
same essential effect: The numbers in company reports will be
confusing, and stock prices will be unusually volatile.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that increase inventories are adding costs and
temporarily depressing earnings. It will take quick footwork to
convince Wall Street analysts that measures intended to prevent
truly serious problems aren't reasons to lower long-term
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors won't get the message, of course, and they'll
liquidate long-term positions on essentially meaningless changes in
quarterly numbers.
</P>
<P>
   While some companies are recording higher costs as a result of
building inventory, others in the same industry will be showing
unexpectedly strong sales as customers step up orders so they, too,
can stockpile critical components.
</P>
<P>
   Investors shouldn't get too excited by that good news, either.
Those increased sales in the current quarter will lead to reduced
sales in future quarters when customers cut back on purchases in
order to work down inventory to normal, just-in-time levels.
</P>
<P>
   Smoothing out the trend to get a picture of what's really going
on will require intensive research and number crunching by analysts
and investors.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors will opt to sell instead of putting in the work
to figure out what the numbers mean _ after all, the conventional
wisdom is that the approach of the millennium will send share
prices down as worried individuals move to good old low-tech cash.
</P>
<P>
   But even here, the potential treats will temper the effect of
the potential tricks. Safety is a relative term, after all, and
from the perspective of individuals who have most of their money in
the stock markets of Brazil, Mexico, and Taiwan, the U.S. financial
markets look positively Y2K-bug proof.
</P>
<P>
   And U.S. banks, as well as European-based global banks, are
likely to see an inflow of cash from wealthy foreigners who think
having a bit of cash in New York or Miami is just a prudent hedge
against systems failure back home. Foreign corporations are likely
to make similar moves.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that the approach of the millennium will move
numbers _ at individual companies and in entire financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   The short-term changes in the figures, for better or worse, will
be big enough that analysts and investors will have a hard time
ignoring them. The market can be counted on to make too much of the
short-term trend: Research shows that the market tends to project
short-term change further into the future than the facts warrant.
</P>
<P>
   Temporary volatility in earnings or global cash flows will seem
more important than they are because of this tendency.
</P>
<P>
   The market will eventually get it right and correct those
errors. But that adjustment will take time, and while the market
works its way through this volatility, there will be more than
enough moments that seem truly horrifying.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who allow the momentary fright to scare them out of
long-term holdings are likely to regret it.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who can shrug off the scare and buy individual
equities when some loud ``boo'' has sent other investors running
for cover are likely to find their bags full of treats long after
the goblins have been put to bed. &QL;

   U.S. investors may decide to head for the sidelines, pulling
money out of financial markets in favor of the security of cash.
But foreign investors, especially those with money in emerging
markets, are likely to flee to the comparative safety of the U.S.
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Focusing on the tricks the Y2K bug may play on investors means
paying attention to only part of the story.
</P>
<P>
   Take a look at the auto industry. The big U.S.-based automakers
such as Ford and General Motors are exactly the kinds of companies
most susceptible to the bite of the year-2000 bug.
</P>
<P>
   They sit at the top of immensely long supply chains: Their
assembly lines require interior assemblies from Lear and body
frames from Tower Automotive, for example. Those suppliers rely on
even smaller suppliers for everything from screws to vinyl.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these parts are delivered by computerized just-in-time
inventory systems that try to keep parts on hand to a minimum. Any
disruption to that flow, and the computerized manufacturing systems
that churn out cars will grind to a halt for days or weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, auto executives know this _ and know that no matter
how rigorously they've tested their own internal systems the
carmakers are at the mercy of systems failures anywhere in the
supply chain.
</P>
<P>
   So what have these companies been doing? Well, they have asked
suppliers to ensure that their own systems are bug-free _ and
they've temporarily turned their just-in-time inventory systems
into just-in-case insurance policies by stockpiling larger than
normal supplies of critical components. Momentary glitches won't
shut this industry down.
</P>
<P>
   You'll see the same thing in industry after industry, with the
same essential effect: The numbers in company reports will be
confusing, and stock prices will be unusually volatile.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that increase inventories are adding costs and
temporarily depressing earnings. It will take quick footwork to
convince Wall Street analysts that measures intended to prevent
truly serious problems aren't reasons to lower long-term
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors won't get the message, of course, and they'll
liquidate long-term positions on essentially meaningless changes in
quarterly numbers.
</P>
<P>
   While some companies are recording higher costs as a result of
building inventory, others in the same industry will be showing
unexpectedly strong sales as customers step up orders so they, too,
can stockpile critical components.
</P>
<P>
   Investors shouldn't get too excited by that good news, either.
Those increased sales in the current quarter will lead to reduced
sales in future quarters when customers cut back on purchases in
order to work down inventory to normal, just-in-time levels.
</P>
<P>
   Smoothing out the trend to get a picture of what's really going
on will require intensive research and number crunching by analysts
and investors.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors will opt to sell instead of putting in the work
to figure out what the numbers mean _ after all, the conventional
wisdom is that the approach of the millennium will send share
prices down as worried individuals move to good old low-tech cash.
</P>
<P>
   But even here, the potential treats will temper the effect of
the potential tricks. Safety is a relative term, after all, and
from the perspective of individuals who have most of their money in
the stock markets of Brazil, Mexico, and Taiwan, the U.S. financial
markets look positively Y2K-bug proof.
</P>
<P>
   And U.S. banks, as well as European-based global banks, are
likely to see an inflow of cash from wealthy foreigners who think
having a bit of cash in New York or Miami is just a prudent hedge
against systems failure back home. Foreign corporations are likely
to make similar moves.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that the approach of the millennium will move
numbers _ at individual companies and in entire financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   The short-term changes in the figures, for better or worse, will
be big enough that analysts and investors will have a hard time
ignoring them. The market can be counted on to make too much of the
short-term trend: Research shows that the market tends to project
short-term change further into the future than the facts warrant.
</P>
<P>
   Temporary volatility in earnings or global cash flows will seem
more important than they are because of this tendency.
</P>
<P>
   The market will eventually get it right and correct those
errors. But that adjustment will take time, and while the market
works its way through this volatility, there will be more than
enough moments that seem truly horrifying.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who allow the momentary fright to scare them out of
long-term holdings are likely to regret it.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who can shrug off the scare and buy individual
equities when some loud ``boo'' has sent other investors running
for cover are likely to find their bags full of treats long after
the goblins have been put to bed. &QL;

   A funny thing happened on the way to the millennium: prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   The world's economies grew stronger, not weaker. After a
disastrous 1998, when Asia imploded and Russian assets evaporated,
most pros bet that 1999 would be another year of global gloom.
Prominent brokerage houses forecast a recession in the U.S. _
wrongly.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest risk to the world economy today is not recession but
excessive growth, which spurs central bankers to apply higher
interest rates as a brake. At the end of October, the U.S.
Department of Commerce reported that gross domestic product grew
4.8 percent in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Take that, prophets of doom!
</P>
<P>
   Around the world, prospects may not be as uniformly sunny, but
there's plenty of good news. Japan, for example, is finally getting
off its knees. Last winter, the Nikkei still looked sick at 14,000
or so (about a third its 1989 peak), and the GDP was actually
shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Nikkei has gained 36 percent through October (in
U.S.-dollar terms). The government has cut income taxes, and
Japanese CEOs have started trimming fat payrolls.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Nissan and Mitsubishi announced major restructuring
deals in order to attract foreign investors and achieve
profitability.
</P>
<P>
   As Japan grinds forward, it will pull its neighbors along with
it. South Korea, Indonesia, and Malaysia have already bounced back.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark stock indexes of South Korea and Indonesia have
jumped, respectively, about 48 percent and 45 percent through
October. Even Malaysia, which panicked and placed capital controls
on foreign investors, has enjoyed a 28 percent gain.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997-98 crisis created a lot of wreckage, but it also forced
banks to allocate credit more efficiently, rather than on the
nepotistic basis of who owes a favor to the prime minister's
brother-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   When Asia collapsed in 1997-98, global commodity prices
collapsed, too. The stock prices for such leading Canadian
companies as Inco, the world's largest nickel producer, fell down
the mine shaft.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the Commodities Research Bureau commodity price index
plunged almost 20 percent. But in the past six months, stronger
Asian economies _ which buy raw materials from countries like
Canada _ have lit a fire under commodities and under Canadian
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Europe has not done so well. Because the new euro began the year
with a belly flop that wiped out 12 percent of its value, most U.S.
investors have not made money on euroland stocks.
</P>
<P>
   This will change if the new European Central Bank, which to date
looks more like a rabble than a coherent group of decision makers,
achieves some credibility in its second year.
</P>
<P>
   Even though economies are recovering there and GDP is likely to
grow faster than 2 percent in 2000, big question marks hang over
the continent.
</P>
<P>
   Latin America is not yet a clear winner, either. In June, I
warned that the Mexican market had jumped too high too quickly and
was due for a big pullback. In May it was up 65 percent for the
year, while at the end of October it was up only about 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Latin America is plagued by Y2K fears, as well as political
tremors. Mexico will hold a presidential election in 2000, and
though it should be peaceful, investors remember the disaster of
1994, which began with a candidate's assassination and ended with
the peso's devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the markets should be more boring in 2000 than they
were from 1997 through 1999. That's not a bad way to start a new
century.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, such boredom will be challenged by the blaring
trumpets of the U.S. presidential election. But as long as Federal
Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan stays in good health,
investors will likely shrug off the noise. &QL;

 A PUZZLING DECLINE OF BUTTERFLIES IN SACRAMENTO VALLEY  &HT;     By GLEN MARTIN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Butterfly populations are at an almost 30-year
low in the Sacramento Valley, adjacent foothills and the
Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   Entomologists find the data particularly worrisome because the
decline is so widespread and there is no clear reason for it.
</P>
<P>
   Some species that typically are very common _ including orange
sulphur butterflies _ have been almost absent in the region this
year. A few varieties were up in numbers, but the overall trend was
way, way down.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all candor, I don't understand this,'' said Arthur Shapiro,
an entomologist at the University of California at Davis. ``Many
more species are down than up. If this were the stock market,
investors would be worried.''
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro noted the decline as he tallied butterflies for an
entomology census that UC Davis has been conducting for 28 years.
The census monitors populations in an area that stretches from the
Suisun marsh in Solano County to the eastern slope of the Sierra.
</P>
<P>
   Butterfly numbers for much of the Sacramento Valley were lower
this year than at any other point in the project's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the problem areas are at the lower elevations, centering
on the southern Sacramento Valley. Butterfly numbers above 5,000
feet were normal or even somewhat better than average,'' Shapiro
said.
</P>
<P>
   In biweekly surveys throughout the year, researchers found few
or no specimens for 14 of the 55 species that reside in the census
area. ``All of these species fluctuate normally, but they don't
normally fluctuate in such large numbers simultaneously,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The decline is also puzzling because most north state butterfly
species produce several generations throughout the year's long
breeding season, Shapiro said. ``They usually have plenty of
opportunity throughout the summer to deal with any setbacks, but
they didn't do that this year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the species that crashed are typically among the most
common, said Shapiro, including orange sulphurs, a vibrant yellow,
medium-sized butterfly that usually swarms over the Sacramento
Valley's abundant alfalfa fields.
</P>
<P>
   Other species that experienced steep declines include painted
ladies, anise swallowtails, pygmy blue butterflies, California
sisters, fiery skippers, field skippers and buckeyes.
</P>
<P>
   Monarchs, large orange-and-black migratory butterflies that are
among the most easily identified of insects, also declined. At
Natural Bridges State Beach in Aptos (Santa Cruz County), where
Northern California monarchs winter, 14,000 butterflies were
counted, down from an average of about 60,000.
</P>
<P>
   Monarchs were at the center of a controversy earlier this year,
when scientists at Cornell University concluded that they may be
harmed by certain types of genetically engineered corn that
produces pollen poisonous to moth and butterfly larvae.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent research has thrown that study into doubt, and
Shapiro said there is no evidence linking California monarch
declines with genetically manipulated crops.
</P>
<P>
   The news isn't completely bad. A couple of species _ tiger and
pale swallowtails _ have been more abundant than usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then there have been some occurences that are simply
strange,'' Shapiro said. ``Great purple hairstreams were abundant
in Sierra Valley this year, which is north of Truckee and has an
elevation of 5,000 feet. Normally they don't come anywhere near
there, except as rare strays. They're strictly a low-elevation
butterfly.''
</P>
<P>
   One development has particularly ominous implications. In recent
days, orange sulphur butterflies have begun to emerge from their
cocoons, thanks to the unusually warm, dry weather. That's
something that's normally seen only during drought years, Shapiro
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time I really remember seeing it on this scale was
during the big drought of the 1970s,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro said there is no apparent reason for the decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pesticide use patterns haven't really changed and recent
habitat loss hasn't been sufficient to account for this,'' he said.
``Nothing has really changed that can explain these oddities,
unless something subtle is going on that has finally reached a
threshold level.''
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro said he won't know if the decline is regional or
national in scope until other entomologists begin comparing notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be sending our data to regional coordinators for the
Lepidopterist's Society,'' he said, referring to a group that
studies butterflies and similar insects. ``They'll produce a field
summary sometime next spring. But everyone in butterflies is
already muttering that this has been a really weird year.''  &LR;

ENERGY CHIEF HINTS DISCIPLINARY ACTION POSSIBLE AT LIVERMORE LAB
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By BERNADETTE TANSEY 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ Even as he sought to boost morale at Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory, Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson
said Tuesday some managers of a superlaser project face possible
disciplinary action for concealing delays and cost overruns from
him.
<P>
   Richardson assured employees at the lab that he would fight to
preserve funding for its troubled $1.2 billion National Ignition
Facility, but warned that problems have imperiled the project's
survival.
</P>
<P>
   The energy secretary swept through the San Francisco Bay Area
Tuesday trying to reassure scientists at Department of
Energy-funded defense laboratories where morale has sunk during a
year marked by spying allegations, research snags and charges of
racial discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   In a two-state tour that began at Los Alamos National Laboratory
on Monday, Richardson faced a difficult balancing act _ restoring
the Energy Department's credibility in the wake of reports that
nuclear secrets had fallen into the hands of Chinese espionage
agents, while healing rifts created by a subsequent security
crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said he fully supported the indictment of Wen Ho Lee,
a Los Alamos computer scientist charged with mishandling classified
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree with the charges. They are serious,'' Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   But the secretary also met with Bay Area Asian American groups
concerned that lab experts of Asian descent had been unfairly
singled out for scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``Asian Americans should not be racially profiled,'' Richardson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee filed a lawsuit this week claiming federal agencies zeroed
in on him as a suspect in the Chinese spying investigation because
of his ethnicity. Lee has not been accused of sharing secrets with
another country.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson called the lawsuit ``unfounded and without merit.''
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the concerns of Livermore workers with top-secret
security clearance who now face polygraph examinations, Richardson
said the lie-detector tests will include no ``lifestyle-related''
questions and will be administered to political appointees as well
as rank-and-file scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Pollaine, a physicist who designs targets for experiments
at the ignition facility, said he was relieved to learn that the
Energy Department plans to order polygraphs only for those in
intelligence, counterintelligence or those with special access to
information that would be militarily useful.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't include the run-of-the-mill nuclear designers,''
Pollaine said.
</P>
<P>
   Saying security weaknesses at the Energy Department's nuclear
weapons labs have been cured, Richardson pledged to keep the
security clampdown from creating a stranglehold over scientific
communication.
</P>
<P>
   ``This turbulent year is over,'' he said. ``We are going to
restore the balance of science and security in favor of science.''
</P>
<P>
   But in an interview with The Chronicle, Richardson acknowledged
that his promises to lab workers hinge on his ability to persuade
Congress to advance needed funding and back off on some security
mandates.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with orders from Congress that the Energy Department
interpreted as requiring polygraphs for some 13,000 workers,
Richardson scaled back the program to cover only 800 scientists
with access to nuclear secrets. But he said the Clinton
administration must seek ``cleanup legislation'' next year to
reduce the number of polygraph tests.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said he will also seek legislation lifting limits on
the access of foreign nationals to scientific information generated
by Energy Department projects in energy research and other advanced
technical fields.
</P>
<P>
   Congress may also balk at continuing to fund Livermore's
ignition facility, where belated revelations about cost overruns of
as much as $350 million embarrassed Richardson in September.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the botched communications ``a comedy of errors,''
Richardson said disciplinary action is being considered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody has to be held accountable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Livermore lab director Bruce Tarter is among those who
reportedly knew the project was headed for trouble as far back as
June, when Richardson was assured the ignition facility was on
budget and on time.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Tarter's role, Richardson said, ``I have felt that
director Tarter has always been straight with me. He's a good
manager.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Urban sprawl can be stopped without calling out the
lifestyle police
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I mention this with some trepidation, because even to suggest we
might give a thought to the downside of urban sprawl is to be
accused of trying to call out the lifestyle police to round up
suburbanites, confiscate their cars and make them live in cities
and ride buses.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact remains that, as the U.S. Agriculture Department
recently reported, development is taking up farmland, forests and
other open space in this decade at twice the rate of the 1980s. In
the '80s, we bulldozed open land at the rate of 1.4 million acres
annually. Between 1992 and '97, some 16 million acres went to
development, a rate of 3.2 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Texas was the big loser, with 1.2 million acres gone. Some
others: Georgia lost 1 million acres, North Carolina 781,000,
Florida nearly a million, Ohio more than a half-million.
</P>
<P>
   The consequences are as you'd suppose: more cars, longer
commutes, worsened air pollution, lost family time and lost
community, frustration. And public massive resources channeled to
new roads and infrastructure, typically to the neglect of the old.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even the tentative concern over such matters that has
emerged in political discussions has excited a reaction charging
that car-hating, suburbia-bashing, anti-capitalist loonies are on
the march. It appears that an endless suburbia, spreading to every
horizon, is somehow God-given.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, of course, sprawl is the outcome -- in its current
excesses, the unintended outcome -- of quite deliberate public
policies.
</P>
<P>
   Federal FHA and veterans' loan programs subsidized suburban
development. Far more transportation money goes to new, often
speculative freeways than to public transit or the maintenance and
upgrading of existing roads. Zoning policies bar mixed-use
development and enforce low density housing. Public infrastructure
development subsidizes suburban builders, while environmental rules
makes it costly to reclaim used urban sites.
</P>
<P>
   And more: The home-mortgage tax deduction favors typical
suburban incomes and provides an incentive for bigger lots. Private
mortgage lending policies favor new suburban homes over city homes
-- and now often over older suburban homes, too.
</P>
<P>
   But mention that perhaps we ought to think about policies that
could slow sprawl and you'll be charged with trying to control
people's lives through social engineering. Well, we
social-engineered ourselves into this mess. Why it is ideologically
inadmissible to think about ways to get ourselves out of it?
</P>
<P>
   No special virtue resides in either city or suburban styles.
They needn't be at the expense of each other. Instead, a closer
coherence of development would support both. It is not an affront
to free-market values or personal choice to imagine development
that preserves countryside, requires fewer and shorter auto trips
and actually increases living options.
</P>
<P>
   Not even many suburbanites these days, steaming in their own
gridlock, would buy into their defenders' cry that the answer to
sprawl is more sprawl.

 &HT;    Rocker fires another bean ball at N.Y.
 &HT;    By Darryl Maxie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you thought John Rocker's comments during the
National League playoffs were controversial, you ain't heard
nothing yet.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Braves relief pitcher rips into foreigners,
homosexuals and, of course, the Big Apple, in this week's Sports
Illustrated, saying he would retire before playing for a New York
team.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker's comments during the National League Championship Series
baited New York fans. He called them ``a tired act'' and said, ``To
hell with Mets fans.'' The comments irritated Braves manager Bobby
Cox, who said Rocker is ``a great pitcher, a great competitor, but
he needs to work on his player/fan relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rocker may have more to work on than that. In the most
inflammatory quotes of his two-year career, Rocker, 25, makes it
clear that Mets fans aren't the only ones he doesn't like.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing I don't like about New York are the
foreigners,'' Rocker told the magazine. ``You can walk an entire
block in Times Square and not hear anybody speaking English. Asians
and Koreans and Vietnamese and Indians and Russians and Spanish
people and everything up there. How the hell did they get in this
country?''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker envisioned what life would be like playing home games for
a New York team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would retire first,'' he said. ``It's the most hectic,
nerve-wracking city. Imagine having to take the No. 7 train to the
ballpark, looking like you're (riding through) Beirut, next to some
kid with purple hair, next to some queer with AIDS right next to
some dude who just got out of jail for the fourth time, right next
to some 20-year-old mom with four kids. It's depressing.''

AIG SAID READY TO ACQUIRE TROUBLED TRUST INSURANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A giant New York &UR;  &LR; insurance company whose operations
span the globe is interested in acquiring financially troubled
Trust Insurance Co. of Taunton, Mass., a source familiar with the
negotiations said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The source said American International Group, one of the world's
largest and most profitable insurers, is preparing to make a major
investment in Trust, presumably to take control of the company.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the investment is not clear yet, the source said,
although it would be well in excess of the $20 million proposed by
an earlier suitor, Worcester, Mass. auto dealer David ``Duddie''
Massad.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Trust nor AIG would comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Massachusetts Division of Insurance, whose
approval would be needed for any takeover, said the paperwork
required to complete such a transaction had not been filed.
</P>
<P>
   The source said AIG executives and state officials have
conferred, but the state agency's spokesman said he was not aware
of any meetings.
</P>
<P>
   If a deal is near, it would not only shore up a financially
ailing Bay State insurance company but presumably breathe new life
into the market for home and auto insurance in Massachusetts. Most
major national auto insurers have shunned the state since the late
1980s because of its restrictive regulatory policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``AIG entering the marketplace would be a very big event in the
Massachusetts insurance world,'' said Stephen D'Amato, a consumer
advocate on insurance matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among insurers, AIG is a highly respected and even feared
competitor. It has a reputation for being an aggressive company
that will do what it takes to be a major force in a market. And
with local insurers cutting back on their safe-driver discounts,
AIG would be well positioned to gain market share by offering
larger discounts to drivers.''
</P>
<P>
   AIG has about 48,000 employees and a market value of $163
billion. In 1998, its most recently completed fiscal year, it
reported net income of $3.76 billion on revenue of $33.2 billion.
It sells all types of insurance, but the bulk of its income tends
to come from overseas insurance operations.
</P>
<P>
   While rumors of AIG's interest in Trust have circulated in
insurance circles for weeks, officials at Massachusetts companies
said they were puzzled why such a giant would be interested in such
a gnat.
</P>
<P>
   The source said Tuesday that AIG wants to grow its domestic auto
and homeowners insurance business and is interested in acquiring
Trust because of its network of insurance agents, which would let
AIG avoid starting from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would have a new 800-pound gorilla in town with this,''
the source said.
</P>
<P>
   Trust has been having trouble keeping its head above water
lately. The company was started in 1989 after founder Craig Bradley
left Commerce Insurance in Webster, Mass., after a dispute with
officials there. Bradley built Trust into one of the top 10
insurers in the state, but profits vanished last year.
</P>
<P>
   In May Trust said it lost $21 million in 1998; a couple of
months later, it increased that figure to $26 million. The loss was
enough to wipe out half of the company's reserves. Trust blamed
computer glitches and problems with its reinsurers.
</P>
<P>
   In October the company negotiated the terms of a $20 million
investment by Massad, only to see that deal fall apart in early
November.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors that Trust was about to fail were so strong at the time
that state Insurance Commissioner Linda Ruthardt took the unusual
step on Nov. 11 of stating that her agency ``has not concluded that
Trust is unable to meet its obligations in the normal course of
business.''

   ROME _ Everyone knows that all roads lead to Rome.
</P>
<P>
   True or not, the accuracy of this proverb will be tested in this
historic capital over the next year.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 30 million Roman Catholic pilgrims are expected to
descend upon the Eternal City, arriving from all corners of the
globe to celebrate what is expected to be the Church's most
spectacular grand jubilee, its 26th. As a result, many expect that
the patience of Rome's four million inhabitants and the very fabric
of this ancient and delicate city will be tested _ if they haven't
been already.
</P>
<P>
   For more than five years, Italy and the Vatican have been
actively planning for the year-long event, which will kick off on
Christmas Eve and conclude Jan. 6, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that it ushers in the new millennium, which coincides
with the 2000th anniversary of the birth of Jesus Christ, makes it
that much more enticing for the world's Roman Catholic's to heed
Pope John Paul II's call to bear witness in Rome and attend his
papal plenary indulgences.
</P>
<P>
   The first jubilee was called by Pope Boniface VIII in 1300 to
bring hope back to Rome after waves of plague devastated the city's
population and spirit. The event was attended by the poet Dante,
who wrote about it in his Divine Comedy.
</P>
<P>
   After suffering countless sieges and sacks by bands arriving
from all over Europe, Rome has seen its fair share of face-lifts.
This time, armed with rosaries, cash and credit cards, the expected
hordes will be far more benevolent.
</P>
<P>
   After the required stop in Rome, many are expected to spread out
through Italy to visit such noted relics as the Shroud of Turin.
The pilgrims should be welcomed with open arms _ or at the worst an
over-priced ice cream by Holy Year opportunists. Welcome or not,
visitors are expected to pump billions of dollars into Italy's
economy over the year.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare itself for the anticipated crush, Rome and much of
Italy has been making itself over. The facade of St. Peter's
Basilica, for example, has been scrubbed to a squeaky white at a
cost of $5.4 million. Elsewhere, the Basilica of St. Francis of
Assisi, which suffered severe earthquake damage two years ago, has
recently been re-opened after the 40,000 man-hours it took to
repair the exquisite 13th-century frescos attributed to Ciambue and
Giotto.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the public works have brought such pleasing results,
however.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, hundreds of thousands of commuters find themselves
entangled in bottleneck traffic, their cars and scooters collecting
dust from the myriad construction projects, most of which are far
behind schedule. During rush hour, honking is the only sound
capable of drowning out the sonorous knells from the bells in the
city's countless churches.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic has been continuously re-routed to accommodate the road
upgrading and repairs, which consume a major portion of the $950
million being spent nationwide on more than 700 improvement
projects.
</P>
<P>
   Construction plans require that new barricades be erected on an
almost daily basis. Drivers must constantly re-learn the daily
commute. For modern-day Romans, dead-ending into new construction
sites has been as routine as their morning pastry and cafe latte.
</P>
<P>
   A government-commissioned survey earlier this year stated that
7-out-of-10 public works projects may not be completed by the Dec.
31 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Still, through all this chaos, many Romans see a light at the
end of the tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is worth it,'' said Emiliano Leonetti, who sells newspapers
and videos from a kiosk surrounded by barricades in the usually
picturesque Campo dei Fiori, a square in the historical city
center. ``We, like everyone else here have lost money, a lot of
business. Maybe 50 percent, but the work had to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Voicing what may be the Roman mantra of the day, he adds, ``It's
just too bad they decided to do it all at once.''

</P>
<P>
   By far the most contentious issue to surface this summer was
when workers building a ramp to a vast underground parking lot
happened upon the frescoed walls of an ancient Roman villa. The
Italian Ministry of Culture immediately halted the work until it
could be determined whether the first century villa is worth
saving.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the underground Vatican parking lot, when completed,
will be large enough to accommodate 115 tour buses and 800 cars.
</P>
<P>
   Rome Mayor Francesco Rutelli, a former leader of the Green
Party, infuriated many of his allies when he said that the ruins
constitute ``less than what is found in the average Roman's
basement.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding insult to injury, a police investigation turned up fresco
and statue fragments at a city dump, further incensing
conservationists, citizens groups and archeologists.
</P>
<P>
   Rutelli, having been accused of compromising history for a
parking lot, attempted to silence critics by saying that in Rome,
``relics are found everywhere you dig.''
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't alone. Despite the vocal protests _ including those of
Culture Minister Giovanna Melandri _ Italian Premier Massimo
D'Alema's Cabinet voted earlier this month for the ramp's
construction to be completed.
</P>
<P>
   With numerous artistic events planned for Jubilee 2000, secular
and religious visitors or residents should have little trouble
finding enjoyment in the Eternal City. New museums have been
opened, for instance, while the collections of others have been
expanded.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the frenetic activity and anticipation for the
historic millennium here, not everyone is caught up in all the hype
surrounding the year 2000 celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Daniela Benincampi's family has run a tobacco and souvenir shop
in scenic Piazza Navona since 1956. Asked what impact she expects
the Jubilee will have on Rome and her business, she shrugs her
shoulders, sticks out her chin and answers: ``Nothing, absolutely
nothing.''

   Voicing what may be the Roman mantra of the day, he adds, ``It's
just too bad they decided to do it all at once.''

   By far the most contentious issue to surface this summer was
when workers building a ramp to a vast underground parking lot
happened upon the frescoed walls of an ancient Roman villa. The
Italian Ministry of Culture immediately halted the work until it
could be determined whether the first century villa is worth
saving.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the underground Vatican parking lot, when completed,
will be large enough to accommodate 115 tour buses and 800 cars.
</P>
<P>
   Rome Mayor Francesco Rutelli, a former leader of the Green
Party, infuriated many of his allies when he said that the ruins
constitute ``less than what is found in the average Roman's
basement.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding insult to injury, a police investigation turned up fresco
and statue fragments at a city dump, further incensing
conservationists, citizens groups and archeologists.
</P>
<P>
   Rutelli, having been accused of compromising history for a
parking lot, attempted to silence critics by saying that in Rome,
``relics are found everywhere you dig.''
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't alone. Despite the vocal protests _ including those of
Culture Minister Giovanna Melandri _ Italian Premier Massimo
D'Alema's Cabinet voted earlier this month for the ramp's
construction to be completed.
</P>
<P>
   With numerous artistic events planned for Jubilee 2000, secular
and religious visitors or residents should have little trouble
finding enjoyment in the Eternal City. New museums have been
opened, for instance, while the collections of others have been
expanded.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the frenetic activity and anticipation for the
historic millennium here, not everyone is caught up in all the hype
surrounding the year 2000 celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Daniela Benincampi's family has run a tobacco and souvenir shop
in scenic Piazza Navona since 1956. Asked what impact she expects
the Jubilee will have on Rome and her business, she shrugs her
shoulders, sticks out her chin and answers: ``Nothing, absolutely
nothing.''

<P>
   The new year _ the new millennium _ is finally upon us. So what?
</P>
<P>
   Do you really expect to wake up Jan. 1 and find that you are
suddenly living a real-life episode of ``The Jetsons'' or ``Star
Trek'' ? It's doubtful.
</P>
<P>
   With so much fear of Y2K and so much angst about where to spend
Millennium Eve, many people have overlooked the fact that the Big
2000 could well be a big bust.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the real outlook for the next year, maybe even the next
century, has little to do with futuristic fantasies. If you truly
want to prepare yourself for the future, forget about robotic pets
and teleportation. Here are some of the biggest trends I see coming
_ and some of the things you'll definitely want to have for the new
millennium:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TIME AS STATUS SYMBOL &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For years we've been promised a futuristic world in which
tedious tasks would be taken care of effortlessly, enabling us to
spend our time on more enjoyable activities. While the future may
not have lived up to its promise, we are holding on to this idea.
</P>
<P>
   In our overscheduled, overstressed, on-demand world, time will
become the new status symbol. We will crave more free time and more
control over our time. Pleasurable, time-consuming activities _
such as playing golf, cooking extensive meals, even knitting _ are
quickly becoming the new symbols of success.
</P>
<P>
   MILLENNIUM MUST-HAVE: The SAM (Secret Agent Man) watch will be a
hot way to keep track of time. This hip-looking black timepiece
from Spoon (Seiko) can store up to 100 memos and features three
alarms that can flash written reminders. Cost: about $215.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HIGH TOUCH &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it's great to be able to buy groceries over the Net at 2
a.m., and it's nice to know you can be faxed at altitudes of 35,000
feet. But along with all the benefits of technology is coming a
need for more human interaction and for products and services that
offer the personal touch, or what I like to call ``high touch.''
</P>
<P>
   Surveys done by my market-research company, Youth Intelligence,
show young people reacting against the impersonal feel of computers
and the fact that they can be reached at any moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're supposed to be more connected than ever,'' one
16-year-old from Los Angeles said, ``yet I feel like we're living
in our own worlds and missing each other.''
</P>
<P>
   As we seek personal connections and communication, E-mail usage
may actually decrease.
</P>
<P>
   MILLENNIUM MUST-HAVE: Personalized stationery will be prized.
We'll send handwritten notes or letters when the thought ``really
counts'' and computer-generated text won't cut it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HOME SWEET HOME &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After the wild partying of the millennium, we'll be ready to
take a break. For many, the world is getting scarier and more
fragmented. Young people say they are worried about where the next
random act of violence might take place.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, we'll be staying in and entertaining more _ and
turning our homes into private mini-vacation spots. This isn't just
``cocooning.'' In the next decade, home will become as interesting
a destination as the local megaplex!
</P>
<P>
   MILLENNIUM MUST-HAVE: TiVo is a ``personal TV service'' that
offers more control over what you watch and when you watch it. It
can be programmed to record up to 30 hours worth of shows _ and
edit out the commercials. The service also enables you to activate
``slow motion'' and ``instant replay'' during live broadcasts or
receive suggestions about shows you might like, based on your
preferences.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CUSTOMIZATION &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many people today feel that the world is becoming one big
minimall. Everyone looks the same, acts the d has the same
values. To avoid this feeling of homogenization, we'll be looking
for products that make us feel special and individualistic. One
good example: Levi's ``Custom-Fit'' jeans are created for the buyer
only after his or her body has been electronically scanned and
measured.
</P>
<P>
   MILLENNIUM MUST-HAVE: Name-plate necklaces. We'll want anything
that feels personalized _ especially things that have our names
emblazoned on them.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EXOTIC DRINKS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You may want to ring in the new year with something new in your
glass. By Dec. 31, we'll probably have had our fill of 20th-century
bubbly _ and may have suffered through one too many hangovers to
even consider ordering Champagne.
</P>
<P>
   MILLENNIUM MUST HAVE: Mojitos and Caiparinhias are drinks
popular in South America, one of the trendiest vacation spots. Made
with lime, cachaca and sugar, they're less serious than martinis,
less expensive than Champagne. They embody the exotic spirit that

<P>
   GREEN RIVER, Utah _ December is not the time to talk about
melons.
</P>
<P>
   Talking about melons now is just depressing because the anemic
softballs available in most grocery stores today, imported from
someplace nobody ever heard of like California, aren't Green River
melons, and that's a shame.
</P>
<P>
   No, the time to talk about melons is summer, when the fields
around Green River, Utah, are carpeted by curly, verdant vines
tangling and twisting around their treasure: honeydew and
cantaloupe and watermelon ripening in the high desert sun and
gloating with the promise of sweetness.
</P>
<P>
   Green River's got great melons. People who live here are proud
of the melons, which give the small town of 900 people something to
be known for other than being close to Moab and conveniently
situated on Interstate 70. Through more boom-and-bust cycles than
residents care to remember and current debates about county
boundaries and water and sewer lines, Green River has been the town
that grows those melons.
</P>
<P>
   And Tim Vetere is one of the guys who grows those melons. His
father began growing them in 1958, the year he was born, so his
whole life he's known about crimson sweets and crenshaws, casabas,
honeydew and cantaloupe.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks about melons year-round, planning how to plant the 60
acres on which he and his family grow melons. Even in winter, when
they're taking care of their 150 mother cows and the 250 cows they
winter for other people, he plans for the coming crop.
</P>
<P>
   The Veteres start about 90 percent of their melons in a
hothouse, transferring them to fields in April when the plants have
three leaves, then hot cap them to protect against possible freeze.
They fertilize and flood irrigate once a week, patrol the mounds of
melons for weeds and pests and watch the fruit grow. They usually
begin harvesting at the end of July, when they see signs of
ripeness: cantaloupes and honeydew cracked around the stem,
watermelon of a certain color, other subtle signs dependent on the
melon, the ground, the weather and many other factors.
</P>
<P>
   There is some debate about what makes Green River so ideal for
growing melons, ``but I think it's the way they're raised and
picked,'' Vetere said. ``They're all so fresh. And then the
temperature here's good with the warm nights. That's what makes
them really grow good: It needs to stay 65, 70 at night to make
them grow even.''
</P>
<P>
   During harvest the Veteres pick tons of melons each day, seven
days a week, and sell them to the Macy's grocery store chain and at
their stand by Westman's truck stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do good business there,'' Tim said. ``We've got people that
come through Green River and that's their whole reason to come this
way, to buy the melons.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite customers who drive hundreds of miles for the melons,
Green River melon growers are facing a market in which the price of
everything _ from fuel to farm equipment _ but melons is going up.
Vetere said he's getting a little bit less for the melons than he
was in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to compete with California, New Mexico, Arizona, all
those markets and it's pretty tough,'' he said. ``So you can see
why the price you sell for has stayed the same or gone down and
everything else has gone up.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a cycle Green River is familiar with. The town has boomed
and busted so much it has stretch marks. The town started in the
late 1870s as a settlement on the overland mail route between
Salina, Utah, and Ouray, Colo., according to Edward A. Geary,
author of ``A History of Emery County.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Denver &AMP; Rio Grande Western Railway was completed in
1883, Green River became a shipping point for livestock and mining
equipment, and the influx of railroad workers, cowboys, sheep
herders and prospectors from the Bookcliffs and San Rafael Desert
elevated the town's population to 375. However, when the railroad
moved its divisional operations to Helper, Utah, in the early
1890s, the town's population dropped by half.
</P>
<P>
   The town boomed again in 1901 when oil was discovered nearby,
but when no commercial producers moved in, the town busted again.
In 1906, land developer E.T. Merritt promoted Green River as a
fruit growing area, and dozens of farmers planted several hundred
acres of peach trees along both sides of the Green River. However,
the trees died before producing fruit. More consistent have been
the melons, which J.H. ``Melon'' Brown began growing in Green River
as early as 1900.
</P>
<P>
   The 1950s southern Utah uranium boom echoed positively in Green
River, but the town busted with the rest of the area when uranium
markets slumped.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest boom came with the 1964 establishment of the Utah
Launch Complex of the White Sands Missile Base north of town, which
brought Green River's population to nearly 2,000 before the complex
closed in the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that it took a lot of the town, a lot of people moved
out, and Green River just hasn't recovered yet,'' said Brian
Meadows, Green River treasurer.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Green River's main industry is tourism, ``and I think
the whole strength of Green River is we're out here as an oasis,''
said Allene Spadafora, coordinator for the Green River Travel
Council.
</P>
<P>
   Green River is right in the middle of a whole lot of nothing _
107 miles to Salina, 90 miles to Grand Junction in the middle of
miles of brown, scrub brush desert ringed by the Bookcliffs and
Manti La Sal mountains _ so tired travelers get off I-70 and stop
at one of Green River's stores or stay in one of its dozen hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Spadafora said the travel council is hoping to promote the town
as more than a stop-over, but several town concerns have hindered
growth and development. The town council recently lifted a
moratorium on commercial building enacted because of worries about
the impact of development on the sewer plant and water lines.
Meadows said that during an informal voter poll at the last
election, people were in favor of supporting a new water and sewer
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem I guess we have is all the piping that
goes and feeds the water plant, it's all underneath cement, 30 feet
underground,'' Meadows said. ``That's hard to get to.''
</P>
<P>
   Another problem has arisen from Green River being a split city,
straddling Grand and Emery counties. Meadows said the city would
like to pull away from Grand County and be entirely in Emery
County, but Grand County has balked because Green River also is an
important starting point for river rafting trips and brings in
tourist dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big motels in Green River are all in the Grand County
side, but we get all our utility from Emery County,'' Spadafora
said. ``The sheriff's department and medical center and schools,
our help comes from Emery County.''
</P>
<P>
   That friction has prevented progress, Spadafora said.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever happens, Meadows said, there always will be a core
of Green River residents who stay through booms and busts, county
disputes and water line problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like the small-town atmosphere,'' he said. ``I think
that's probably the reason most people live here.''
</P>
<P>
   Green River residents cheer on the sports teams from Green
River's grade 7-12 school and support the elementary school, show
up for the Fourth of July parade and go all-out for the annual
Melon Days, held the third weekend in September. There's a square
dance festival, kids' games, a huge softball tournament, a talent
show, a parade and, most important, those melons.
</P>
<P>
   Green River grows great melons.

   GREEN RIVER, Utah _ December is not the time to talk about
melons.
</P>
<P>
   Talking about melons now is just depressing because the anemic
softballs available in most grocery stores today, imported from
someplace nobody ever heard of like California, aren't Green River
melons, and that's a shame.
</P>
<P>
   No, the time to talk about melons is summer, when the fields
around Green River, Utah, are carpeted by curly, verdant vines
tangling and twisting around their treasure: honeydew and
cantaloupe and watermelon ripening in the high desert sun and
gloating with the promise of sweetness.
</P>
<P>
   Green River's got great melons. People who live here are proud
of the melons, which give the small town of 900 people something to
be known for other than being close to Moab and conveniently
situated on Interstate 70. Through more boom-and-bust cycles than
residents care to remember and current debates about county
boundaries and water and sewer lines, Green River has been the town
that grows those melons.
</P>
<P>
   And Tim Vetere is one of the guys who grows those melons. His
father began growing them in 1958, the year he was born, so his
whole life he's known about crimson sweets and crenshaws, casabas,
honeydew and cantaloupe.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks about melons year-round, planning how to plant the 60
acres on which he and his family grow melons. Even in winter, when
they're taking care of their 150 mother cows and the 250 cows they
winter for other people, he plans for the coming crop.
</P>
<P>
   The Veteres start about 90 percent of their melons in a
hothouse, transferring them to fields in April when the plants have
three leaves, then hot cap them to protect against possible freeze.
They fertilize and flood irrigate once a week, patrol the mounds of
melons for weeds and pests and watch the fruit grow. They usually
begin harvesting at the end of July, when they see signs of
ripeness: cantaloupes and honeydew cracked around the stem,
watermelon of a certain color, other subtle signs dependent on the
melon, the ground, the weather and many other factors.
</P>
<P>
   There is some debate about what makes Green River so ideal for
growing melons, ``but I think it's the way they're raised and
picked,'' Vetere said. ``They're all so fresh. And then the
temperature here's good with the warm nights. That's what makes
them really grow good: It needs to stay 65, 70 at night to make
them grow even.''
</P>
<P>
   During harvest the Veteres pick tons of melons each day, seven
days a week, and sell them to the Macy's grocery store chain and at
their stand by Westman's truck stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do good business there,'' Tim said. ``We've got people that
come through Green River and that's their whole reason to come this
way, to buy the melons.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite customers who drive hundreds of miles for the melons,
Green River melon growers are facing a market in which the price of
everything _ from fuel to farm equipment _ but melons is going up.
Vetere said he's getting a little bit less for the melons than he
was in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to compete with California, New Mexico, Arizona, all
those markets and it's pretty tough,'' he said. ``So you can see
why the price you sell for has stayed the same or gone down and
everything else has gone up.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a cycle Green River is familiar with. The town has boomed
and busted so much it has stretch marks. The town started in the
late 1870s as a settlement on the overland mail route between
Salina, Utah, and Ouray, Colo., according to Edward A. Geary,
author of ``A History of Emery County.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Denver &AMP; Rio Grande Western Railway was completed in
1883, Green River became a shipping point for livestock and mining
equipment, and the influx of railroad workers, cowboys, sheep
herders and prospectors from the Bookcliffs and San Rafael Desert
elevated the town's population to 375. However, when the railroad
moved its divisional operations to Helper, Utah, in the early
1890s, the town's population dropped by half.
</P>
<P>
   The town boomed again in 1901 when oil was discovered nearby,
but when no commercial producers moved in, the town busted again.
In 1906, land developer E.T. Merritt promoted Green River as a
fruit growing area, and dozens of farmers planted several hundred
acres of peach trees along both sides of the Green River. However,
the trees died before producing fruit. More consistent have been
the melons, which J.H. ``Melon'' Brown began growing in Green River
as early as 1900.
</P>
<P>
   The 1950s southern Utah uranium boom echoed positively in Green
River, but the town busted with the rest of the area when uranium
markets slumped.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest boom came with the 1964 establishment of the Utah
Launch Complex of the White Sands Missile Base north of town, which
brought Green River's population to nearly 2,000 before the complex
closed in the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that it took a lot of the town, a lot of people moved
out, and Green River just hasn't recovered yet,'' said Brian
Meadows, Green River treasurer.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Green River's main industry is tourism, ``and I think
the whole strength of Green River is we're out here as an oasis,''
said Allene Spadafora, coordinator for the Green River Travel
Council.
</P>
<P>
   Green River is right in the middle of a whole lot of nothing _
107 miles to Salina, 90 miles to Grand Junction in the middle of
miles of brown, scrub brush desert ringed by the Bookcliffs and
Manti La Sal mountains _ so tired travelers get off I-70 and stop
at one of Green River's stores or stay in one of its dozen hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Spadafora said the travel council is hoping to promote the town
as more than a stop-over, but several town concerns have hindered
growth and development. The town council recently lifted a
moratorium on commercial building enacted because of worries about
the impact of development on the sewer plant and water lines.
Meadows said that during an informal voter poll at the last
election, people were in favor of supporting a new water and sewer
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem I guess we have is all the piping that
goes and feeds the water plant, it's all underneath cement, 30 feet
underground,'' Meadows said. ``That's hard to get to.''
</P>
<P>
   Another problem has arisen from Green River being a split city,
straddling Grand and Emery counties. Meadows said the city would
like to pull away from Grand County and be entirely in Emery
County, but Grand County has balked because Green River also is an
important starting point for river rafting trips and brings in
tourist dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big motels in Green River are all in the Grand County
side, but we get all our utility from Emery County,'' Spadafora
said. ``The sheriff's department and medical center and schools,
our help comes from Emery County.''
</P>
<P>
   That friction has prevented progress, Spadafora said.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever happens, Meadows said, there always will be a core
of Green River residents who stay through booms and busts, county
disputes and water line problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like the small-town atmosphere,'' he said. ``I think
that's probably the reason most people live here.''
</P>
<P>
   Green River residents cheer on the sports teams from Green
River's grade 7-12 school and support the elementary school, show
up for the Fourth of July parade and go all-out for the annual
Melon Days, held the third weekend in September. There's a square
dance festival, kids' games, a huge softball tournament, a talent
show, a parade and, most important, those melons.
</P>
<P>
   Green River grows great melons.

<P>
   EDITOR'S NOTE: Five years ago, a father sat down to feed his
infant twin girls _ and something went terribly wrong. Now he's in
prison, his mother is raising his babies, and the twins no longer
match. One is healthy and smart.
</P>
<P>
   The other is broken. Michele Poole wants you to know why you
should never, ever shake a baby.
</P>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ It's dark.
</P>
<P>
   Only six people in the room.
</P>
<P>
   The table linens are red. Her suit is blue.
</P>
<P>
   Everything else is just. . . so . . . dark. The faces gathered
around the small tables are lined and worried, like the charcoal
portraits hanging in corners of museums.
</P>
<P>
   She lays her props out on a table. A doll. A plastic container.
An egg.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents Without Partners.'' She begins by repeating the
group's name. Maybe you're overwhelmed, she says. Maybe you're
stressed out. Maybe you know someone who is, and around the room,
grim faces nod.
</P>
<P>
   She hits the button on her tape recorder. A baby cries. Then
wails.
</P>
<P>
   She picks up the doll. This is how it begins, she says. Stop
crying, please. Please, stop crying. And then _ she shakes the
doll. The head jerks back and forth _ snap, snap, snap. The shaking
lasts just seconds, but just seconds, she says, is all it takes.
</P>
<P>
   Next, she holds up the plastic container. It is round, like a
head, and clear, like Tupperware. Inside: the egg. The brain.
</P>
<P>
   She shakes the container, hard.
</P>
<P>
   The egg shatters.
</P>
<P>
   This is what happens to the brain, she says. It slams against
the skull, bruises, tears, bleeds, swells, grapefruit against a
wall.
</P>
<P>
   Before anybody can say anything at all _ not that they would
know what to say, to that _ she disappears to the next room, comes
back in with one last prop. It is Gabbi.
</P>
<P>
   She looks so soft and sweet in her purple dress, like one of
those expensive American Girl dolls with the lush, dark curls and
smooth, white-china skin. ``Here you go, Gabbi,'' Michele says, and
she lifts the little girl up and lays her gently on her stomach on
a purple flowered pad on the small round table with the red cloth.
</P>
<P>
   The table is just big enough to hold her, and with an uumph,
Gabbi lifts her head and tries through her thick glasses to look
around, although she's almost blind.
</P>
<P>
   Michele strokes her curls.
</P>
<P>
   This is what you get, she says, when you shake a baby. Gabbi
can't walk, can't talk, can't sit, can't chew. Gabbi's stuck in
time, a baby forever.
</P>
<P>
   It is past dinnertime, so Michele pours Gabbi's formula into the
big syringe and lets it slip down the plastic tubing to the little
button-hole doctors made in her stomach. This is how Gabbi eats,
she says.
</P>
<P>
   It's dark.
</P>
<P>
   More people have come.
</P>
<P>
   A few are crying.
</P>
<P>
   On the table is a photograph of a little girl with fly-away hair
in a pink and white dress with flowers. Who is she? people have
been wondering.
</P>
<P>
   Gabbi's twin, Michele says. She is everything Gabbi would have
been.
</P>
<P>
   It is quiet as the single moms and dads and grandmas and
grandpas try to take this in.
</P>
<P>
   A woman raises her hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``About Gabbi,'' she ventures. ``Is this the most she will ever
_''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do?''
</P>
<P>
   The woman nods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could be,'' Michele says. ``But maybe there's more.''
</P>
<P>
   Another hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does she know you?''
</P>
<P>
   Michele thinks so.
</P>
<P>
   ``By my voice.''
</P>
<P>
   One more hand, and in the dark the face behind it is angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did somebody go to prison for this?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Michele says.
</P>
<P>
   Silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, as far as Little Michele knows, when Gabbi was a
little baby, she hurt her head, and that's why Gabbi is Gabbi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think she really understands the concept of being a
twin. She knows Gabbi's her sister, but she thinks of her as a
baby. She always asks, `When's Gabbi going to grow up so we can
play?'
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what really got to me when this thing first happened?
The doctors told me Gabbi would be a vegetable. That's precisely
the word they used. Vegetable. And I remember thinking, what kind
of word is that? My kid is not a vegetable! She's Gabbi! She's
Little Michele's twin! She's a person, not some carrot or turnip or
whatever. I mean, c'mon. Ridiculous. But that's what they said, and
then they told me anything she learned to do _ any little thing at
all _ would be a miracle.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think Gabbi has certain capabilities. I like to think we
get little miracles every day. You have to be an optimist, or
you're sunk.''
</P>
<P>
   Michele Poole, the twins' grandmother _ and, by adoption, their
mother _ is navigating her clunky van through suburbia while
keeping one eye out for a Dunkin' Donuts and the other in trview to check on the girls. It's another no-earring day, which
means when she weighed the benefit of looking nice against the few
minutes she would lose looking for and inserting a pair of
earrings, looking nice lost out. That's OK. In her world,
practicality counts. She keeps her dark hair unmercifully short
because short is easy, and if the wheelchair lift breaks, she gets
out a book and fixes it herself rather than wait on the mechanic.
</P>
<P>
   This morning, it was chaos as usual, with Little Michele
practicing her numbers and letters in the pink bedroom at the top
of the stairs _ her Shirley Temple hair flying and red nail polish
glittering as she demonstrated a few karate chops for the tutor _
and Gabbi gazing dreamily at the ceiling and listening to ``Feelin'
Groovy'' in her crib at the bottom of the stairs while Michele
changed her diaper. Then Michele jogged back up to see if Little
Michele wanted pigtails or ponytails, and then she loaded everybody
into the van, and they were off.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what makes it so hard?'' she says, turning into the
shopping center where Little Michele will have her piano lesson.
``You want to do so much for this kid, yet there is only so much
you can do. I can make some adjustments, tinker here and there. But
unless some brilliant scientist comes up with a brain replacement _
well, I do believe in miracles, but I could take Gabbi to Lourdes
and hold her little feet in the pond, and Gabbi would still be . .
. Gabbi.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes in the rearview she sees the twins sleeping, the
differences between them sweetly diminished, and she lets herself
fantasize for a moment that they are just the same, two little
girls, both happy, both healthy. But that's just fantasy. It has
been nearly five years since _ what? The calamity? The crime? The
truth is, Gabbi lost her chance the day her daddy picked her up and
shook her.
</P>
<P>
   It is startling sometimes how much people don't know. Michele
does not need surveys or studies to tell her this _ although there
are plenty of both. No, she learned about the deep pool of public
ignorance in her many informal walking tours.
</P>
<P>
   She might be in a bakery, ordering a strawberry doughnut for
Little Michele, or at the doctor's office, getting Gabbi's checkup,
when some curious observer will stop to comment on Little Michele's
sea-green eyes and Gabbi's snow-white skin. Then, almost always,
they ask The Question.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's wrong with her?''
</P>
<P>
   It's OK that they ask _ people are curious. There are many ways
to answer, depending on Michele's emotional reserves and the
questioner's level of interest. The short answer is always the
same: Gabbi's a shaken baby. Usually, this provokes blank stares. A
what? So Michele tries again. Gabbi has Shaken Baby Syndrome. That
is, when she was very small, an infant, not yet 3 months, somebody
shook her; the shaking probably only lasted seconds, but seconds
are long enough, and now Gabbi can't walk, can't talk, can't eat .
. . can't, can't, can't.
</P>
<P>
   Oh my gosh, people say. I had no idea.
</P>
<P>
   Well, neither did she.
</P>
<P>
   Before all this happened, she could not have guessed that her
only child, George _ the boy with dimples and an attitude _ would
meet a young girl named Monica and that before they could marry she
would be pregnant, and that after they married they would have not
just one child but twins. She could not know that the new parents
would be so overwhelmed that one day when Monica went to work and
George stayed home with the babies, something would go so wrong.
And she never would have fathomed that the dark-haired twin, the
gutsy little crier, would wind up in the pediatric intensive care
unit at Good Sam, so critically injured a priest was summoned for a
hurried baptism in case she did not last the night.
</P>
<P>
   And what a night. The detectives asking questions. The in-laws
arguing. The social workers giving everybody the up and down. The
tight knot of specialists hovering over Gabbi, unconscious and
gasping for air, her tiny, bandaged body lost in a thicket of wires
and tubes. Her head was swollen and her brain was hemorrhaging,
and, well, ``the poor little thing just looked like death,'' as
Michele's neighbor later put it, ``so lost up there in her high
hospital bed.''
</P>
<P>
   But the poor little thing was a fighter. Doctors operated to
relieve the pressure on her brain and hooked her to a ventilator so
she could breathe, and then Gabriela Sabrina Poole hung on _ and
hung on. In the meantime, Little Michele went home with Michele and
her husband Rodney, because in all the confusion, police were
certain of just one thing: In the window of time in question, the
elder Pooles had not been around the babies, and so they could not
have done the shaking.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, there would be a court case and a plea deal, and
then George Poole, the babies' father, would go to prison for 4 1/2
years. And he and Monica, the babies' mother, would agree _ in her
case reluctantly _ to give up the twins for adoption to Michele and
Rod. And in this way, one American family would be shattered and
another would begin.
</P>
<P>
   At Thanksgiving that first year, when the Poole family went
around the table naming what they had to be thankful for, Michele
thought of Gabbi lying in her high hospital bed, and she could not
say anything at all.
</P>
<P>
   So, no.
</P>
<P>
   People have no idea.
</P>
<P>
   And neither did she. ``You know what I'd like to see?'' Michele
says one morning at a Dunkin' Donuts, where she has stopped for
coffee after a business meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see a unified national effort to get the word out
that you should never, ever, under any circumstances _ even if
you're exhausted, even if you're angry, even if you're stressed out
_ shake a baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why can't it be like seat belts?
</P>
<P>
   ``Or bike helmets?
</P>
<P>
   ``Or, hey! You know what's ridiculous? In the hospital, they
tell you all about breast-feeding, but they don't say a thing about
not shaking the baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm telling you, a few public service announcements aren't
going to do it. This thing has got to be hammered into people.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what we need? Something like Mothers Against Drunk
Driving. Everytime somebody dies, they're out there, calling the
press, getting the word out. Why can't it be the same way with
shaking a baby?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well? Why can't it!''
</P>
<P>
   Her hand is pale, and in it her coffee quivers in its plastic
cup. This is Michele Poole's second life. Her first was the kind
most people lead _ the usual ups and downs and setbacks and
victories. In this life, she is more single-minded and determined,
both blessed and cursed with a mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have just got to know about this,'' she says. ``I mean,
how can something so important not be common knowledge?''
</P>
<P>
   When she looks up, she sees that everybody in the little shop _
including a tall guy in a suit standing over her table _ is
listening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry,'' the tall guy says. ``But I just want you to know _
God! I agree with you!''

   EDITOR'S NOTE: Five years ago, a father sat down to feed his
infant twin girls _ and something went terribly wrong. Now he's in
prison, his mother is raising his babies, and the twins no longer
match. One is healthy and smart.
</P>
<P>
   The other is broken. Michele Poole wants you to know why you
should never, ever shake a baby.
</P>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ There were warning signs. But she missed
them.
</P>
<P>
   Michele is thinking about this on a brilliant Tuesday afternoon
in April, in the windowless hall at Miami Children's Hospital. To
cheer things up, the nurses wear bright smocks and smiles. Gabbi,
with her limited vision, catches a splash of color now and then,
but no one knows if she can make out the outline of a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Michele brought Gabbi here to see if her ketogenic
diet needed adjusting. The formula, high-fat and low-carb, has
helped immensely with Gabbi's seizures; when she has one, her whole
body tenses, then quivers, and her arms wing out like a bird's, and
for one awful moment she is on a cross, martyred. She used to take
barbiturates to control the seizures, and those made her sleepy.
But now with the diet, she's off the drugs and more alert.
</P>
<P>
   Today, doctors want to do an MRI scan of Gabbi's brain.
</P>
<P>
   A picture of Gabbi's brain is a sad thing to behold. When
doctors put it up on the light screen, it is easy for a laperson
to see that her brain has not only failed to grow since the injury,
it has atrophied and shrunk. The edges recede too far from the
skull's lining, and in the middle, where brain tissue should be,
the too-large ventricles are filled with nothing but cerebrospinal
fluid.
</P>
<P>
   Even Little Michele has a fundamental understanding of the
problem. One rainy day while looking through family vacation
pictures _ Gabbi in the glittery spray at Niagara Falls, Little
Michele at Pocahontas Village in Jamestown _ she came across a
stray photo of Gabbi on a stretcher with electrodes pasted to her
head. ``Here they are checking Gabbi's brains,'' she said, as if
continuing a travelogue. `` 'Cause, um, they don't work so well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gabriela Poole?''
</P>
<P>
   The nurse is ready.
</P>
<P>
   Gabbi needs a sedative so she will lie perfectly still for the
MRI. When the nurse pinches and sticks, because she can't find a
receptive vein, Gabbi cries, a high, sweet-sad sound, like the
hinges on a door that doesn't get opened enough. Michele strokes
her hair and cries, too; she hates it when Gabbi, who has to endure
so much already, gets the needle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gabbi's a shaken baby,'' Michele tells the nurse, who is
taking history. ``She's had chicken pox. Measles. Ketogenic diet.
Cortically blind. Stiff. Poor mobility. No allergies. Let's see.
What else? She's Twin B.''
</P>
<P>
   The nurse looks up, startled.
</P>
<P>
   ``What about Twin A?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Twin A is fine. She's in school today.''
</P>
<P>
   The nurse thinks about this for a moment, tries to process the
image of Little Michele at The Little Place, practicing her letters
and numbers, while her sister is here, getting a scan that will
show the big, empty places in her brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see far too many of these cases,'' she finally says. She
does not know how many. But she remembers each one, because each
one seems so infuriatingly unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   In the MRI room, the attendant slides Gabbi into the big white
cylinder, and Michele slides into a folding chair, and then because
this is a hospital, and hospitals trigger memories, she thinks
about the biggest regret she has in life.
</P>
<P>
   The cylinder rattles and hums.
</P>
<P>
   The attendant hands her ear plugs.
</P>
<P>
   She puts them in, pulls them out, in, out, in, out.
</P>
<P>
   No good.
</P>
<P>
   They won't block out what she already knows.
</P>
<P>
   It was October 1994 _ a month before the shaking.
</P>
<P>
   George and Monica were living with Rodney and Michele, and one
day after Michele came home from work and from picking George up at
school, she noticed black-and-blue marks on Gabbi's tiny body. She
called her neighbor, Arlene Snyder, who later wrote a letter to the
court, describing the injuries: Gabbi's left ear was ``completely
black and blue, her face bruised in a line from her left ear to the
lower portion of her nose, bruises on her right cheek, her arm and
her leg.''
</P>
<P>
   Just who was responsible never became clear. George had not been
around the babies on the day in question, and Monica insisted she
had not handled the baby roughly. George thought perhaps Gabbi
might have slipped and bumped her head when he was playing with her
the day before, and yet no bruising had been apparent that night or
the next morning. Michele and Rodney talked in circles about
calling the police, but in the end Michele resisted. She thought
she could counsel the young parents on how to handle a baby.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was this:
</P>
<P>
   What if police suspected Michele? Or Rodney? What if they went
to jail? Who would take care of the babies then?
</P>
<P>
   ``So I didn't call.''
</P>
<P>
   The MRI is still humming when she finishes the story. Gabbi's
little feet peek out from the cylinder, the only physical reminder
she is in the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I was so, so wrong,'' Michele says. ``Today I would
tell anybody: If you see a bruise on a baby, call the cops. Don't
worry about going to jail. Don't try to protect yourself. Don't try
to protect anybody except the baby.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, Michele?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Three things I don't know how to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What, Pumpkin?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how to swim. I don't know how to read. And I
don't know how to play the piano.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But you're learning! You're learning all those things!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I'm learning. Plus, I don't know how to cook.''
</P>
<P>
   It is quiet for a moment.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle seat of the van, Little Michele leans over and
takes her sister's hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're learning how to swim, Gabbi,'' she says. ``You're a
very good swimmer. Don't you just love it, Gabbi?''
</P>
<P>
   In her wheelchair, Gabbi nods emphatically, dark curls bobbing,
but it is only because she is asleep, and the van just passed over
a bump.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes when people ask her what her life is like, Michele
tells them about Thursdays. Thursdays are crazy.
</P>
<P>
   You know, you get to be 49, a mother, a grandmother, a
businesswoman, you escape one bad marriage, settle in comfortably,
gratefully, to a second. You do all this, and somehow you don't
expect, at this fine stage of life, to be mixing formula on a
Thursday morning and racing out the door with two little halves of
a twin set _ one in diapers, the other a preschooler _ for a day of
activities usually reserved for 32-year-old moms.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, before the twins, Michele zipped down the
turnpike from her big house in the woods in far-western Palm Beach
County to the citified Pompano Beach offices of North Ridge
Electric, the now-thriving company she and Rodney started from
scratch in 1977. Back then, Rod did most of the field work and
Michele did most of the office work. But now Rod does most of the
business stuff, and Michele does most of the girls' stuff _
although she's still a whiz with the books (in an accounting
crisis, she brings Gabbi to the office, carrying her up 28 steps),
and Rodney, a big bear of a man, can change Gabbi's diaper with the
best of them. And don't even mention Little Michele unless you have
an hour. ``That little pumpkin,'' he likes to say, ``just grabbed
my heart and kept it.''
</P>
<P>
   So even though Michele is still a businesswoman _ and one of
three women on the state Electrical Contractors' Licensing Board _
she is mostly a coffee-swigging, cell phone-ringing car-pool mom.
If Gabbi and Little Michele were like most twins, they would be
piling into the back seat, giggling, poking, elbowing, begging mom
for one more chocolate chip cookie; instead, climbing into the van
is a labored ritual, with Little Michele standing on the
passenger's side to push the buttons that lower the ramp, and Big
Michele wheeling Gabbi up and in and clicking the little turquoise
wheelchair into place.
</P>
<P>
   Little Michele fastens Gabbi's seat belt, and then, usually, she
says, ``Mom, can we get Chicken Nuggets?'' and Michele usually says
yes. And they are off.
</P>
<P>
   First, suburbia slips by hot and green on the way to music
class, where Little Michele is learning to play ``E for Esther
Elephant'' with her third finger on the glossy, black piano while
Gabbi dozes in the corner. Big Michele slips out for a minute to
try to persuade the piano store owner to help with a music festival
for Easter Seals, where Gabbi went to a wonderful day care and
Michele is on the board.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of Michele's favorite rules that you never do just one
thing (go to a piano lesson) when you can do two (go to a piano
lesson and help Easter Seals), and the piano lady is an easy
target. By the end of their talk, she not only pledges her
services, she also has learned the fine points of Shaken Baby
Syndrome and picked up a tip from Michele about never doing
electrical wiring while standing on an aluminum ladder.
</P>
<P>
   After music, suburbia slips by on the way to speech class, where
Miss Natalie with her gentle, sing-song voice is trying to teach
Gabbi to work her lips and tongue by tempting her with a pink
``toothette'' and sometimes a butterscotch lollipop _ so that one
day she might have the skills to eat real food. Eating is one of
Michele's biggest goals for Gabbi, one that right now seems
far-fetched and yet might actually be possible.
</P>
<P>
   But the therapist has another goal. She says Gabbi has
``wants,'' and it is her committed belief that she might be able to
learn how to ask for things. If she's hungry, say, or if she would
like to listen to a bit of Morning Magic music, she might kick her
foot or make a squeak or something. Which is why Miss Natalie has
fastened a big yellow button on Gabbi's wheelchair tray. If
somebody pushes it (optimistically, Gabbi), she is immediately and
enthusiastically rewarded with ``Farmer in the Dell.'' And Gabbi
loves ``Farmer in the Dell.''
</P>
<P>
   So the yellow button is a very big deal _ if only Gabbi could
push it.
</P>
<P>
   Little Michele, who is sitting on a swivel chair eating a
Tootsie Roll, says she would be happy to push it herself, just to
get things going, but she knows that's not really the point.
</P>
<P>
   The point is for Gabbi to do it. But it won't be today, because
today, she has fallen asleep instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe next time!'' Miss Natalie says, and then suburbia slips
by on the way to swimming class.
</P>
<P>
   It is in swimming that Gabbi excels and her sister struggles.
Little Michele is frightened of the water, more so than many kids,
but Gabbi _ blissfully unaware of the dangers _ lets it lick her
limbs as she floats face skyward, her plump, little legs relaxed as
they almost never are, except in sleep, an expression of bliss on
her pixie face.
</P>
<P>
   So that's Thursdays, and Tuesdays aren't any better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might have overbooked,'' Michele says, smiling because she
absolutely has.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if I drop something, like, say, speech, then I would
always be thinking, what if that was going to be the day Gabbi hit
the yellow button? What if that was going to be the day she took a
bite and swallowed real food?
   ``What if that was going to be the day something big happened?''
</P>
<P>
   Shaken-baby cases are notoriously difficult: The people with the
most information are also those responsible for the shaking. And
so, after Gabbi got hurt, Bart Arnold, a detective with the Palm
Beach County Sheriff's Office, took scrupulous notes.
</P>
<P>
   He talked with the hospital doctor, who said Gabbi was in
critical condition, with a bruised and bleeding brain, bruises on
her abdomen and bleeding behind her eyes, a classic sign of Shaken
Baby Syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   He talked with Monica, who said she left the twins with their
father on the Saturday in question _ Nov. 19, 1994 _ while she went
to her cashier's job at a Walgreen's pharmacy.
</P>
<P>
   And he interviewed George, who told him things went terribly
wrong after he dropped his wife off at work, then returned home to
feed the babies: He sat down on the bed, held one in each arm, then
Gabriela slipped from his arms, and he grabbed her. Afterward, she
wailed, and her eyes looked funny. She was flailing. Her cry
sounded like nothing he had ever heard before.
</P>
<P>
   That afternoon, he picked Monica up at work. She saw Gabbi and
asked him, God, what did you do? For the next 12 hours, Gabbi did
not sleep, did not move, barely ate. He and Monica worried all
weekend. Shouldn't they take Gabbi to the doctor? But George was
afraid: If they went to the hospital _ with Gabbi in this condition
_ they might lose custody of the babies. So they waited, all
weekend. On Monday, they took Gabbi to the pediatrician.
</P>
<P>
   The detective pressed further. George admitted he had a temper.
Did you ever shake the babies? No, he said. Then, ``I shake them,
just bounce them.''
</P>
<P>
   In a second interview, he was more specific. He said he grabbed
Gabbi's neck. He said he thought she was dead. He said, ``I thought
I just killed my daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, he shook her. He was trying to rouse her, that's all.
The shaking lasted just five seconds, or 10. He wanted to get her
focused.
</P>
<P>
   One last thing. Anybody who accused him of a crime, he told the
detective, would die. ``A nine millimeter will do just fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Michele is in the kitchen, mixing Gabbi's formula.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know what I sometimes think?'' she says. ``I sometimes
think he might as well have put a gun to her head and killed her.''
This sounds so terrible, she winces. ``But, really, she might have
been better off . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``So, really, unless they anoint that boy Pope and smoke pours
up from the Vatican, I want nothing to do with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, the last time they spoke she also was mixing
formula, getting ready to feed Gabbi through the tube. George was
in prison, serving his time for felony child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The phone rang.
</P>
<P>
   Hi, Mom?
</P>
<P>
   Prison food's terrible.
</P>
<P>
   Please send money.
</P>
<P>
   ``And at that moment, I just snapped,'' Michele says. ``I said,
`I know you can't appreciate this, but if Little Gabbi can't enjoy
normal food, then why should you?' I asked him not to call me
again, and he honored that, because I have not heard from him since
_ and that was three years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Michele says George never admitted to her that he shook Gabbi,
but a few months ago, he wrote a reporter a letter from prison _ he
is not allowed visitors, because of his long string of disciplinary
infractions _ and in it he said he was grateful to Rod and Michele
for stepping in to raise the twins. ``I have no doubts as to there
being `a better place' for my daughters,'' he wrote. ``One does not
exist.''
</P>
<P>
   He added he would not ``attempt to justify'' his actions.
``Hell, I'm guilty.'' A well-bred man, he said, quoting Ben
Franklin, knows how to confess a fault.
</P>
<P>
   Michele read the letter _ and wondered if it really was George
who wrote it.
</P>
<P>
   Some people tell Michele she should hurry up and forgive her
son, before bitterness eats her through. But she isn't buying it.
She tried with George, she really did. And, Rodney, his stepfather,
tried too. They enrolled him in military schools. Drug programs.
Family counseling. Everything. And nothing worked. If she forgives,
she says, she opens herself up all over again to George, and this
she can't afford to do. His prison term is almost up _ in January!
_ so she needs to remain ever-vigilant. Suppose he knocks on her
door and asks to see the kids. What will she do? Call 911?
</P>
<P>
   But that is a worry for another day.

 &HT;    Holiday tome still gives the answers
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA, Fla. _ The Encyclopaedia Britannica may have moved from
bicep-building bindings to airy blips of digital data but a few
reference works remain that can be aimlessly browsed by the
fireplace.
</P>
<P>
   I speak here of ``The Big Book of Christmas and Christmaslike
Phenomena.'' Brought out of the Christmas box for another year of
reference, its duct-taped spine still supple, the book remains a
font of holiday lore.
</P>
<P>
   You'd look in vain to find such patient expositions of the
season's mysteries anywhere else. Consider these sample entries:
</P>
<P>
   ANIMAL CAROLING _ Technological advances now allow
</P>
<P>
   mankind to hear holiday songs performed in animal sounds. First
barking dogs singing ``Jingle Bells'' then cats, chirping birds and
llamas (''A Very Inca Christmas'' Fourth World Records, 1982).
Legislative bans found unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``BLUE CHRISTMAS'' _ ``The greatest song the mind of man has yet
composed'' _ M.R. ``Bob'' Carmellow, ``A Tear in the Eggnog:
Studies in Holiday Melancholia.''
</P>
<P>
   CASH REGISTER BELLS ARE JINGLING _ Still, the No. 1
</P>
<P>
   Christmas journalism cliche even though the last documented cash
register with a jingling bell was retired in 1992. See ``optimistic
merchants'' under ``Christmas Journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``CHRISTIANS AND THE PAGANS'' _Dar Williams' song is unique for
taking on the teeth-gritting tensions of holiday religious
differences. Wiccans and Christians manage dinner and family truce.
The editors prefer this even to John Prine's ``Christmas in
Prison,'' which remains the No. 1, penal-theme Christmas song.
</P>
<P>
   CHRISTMAS WREATH IN A CAN _ See ``Notable Holiday
</P>
<P>
   Marketing Failures.''
</P>
<P>
   CHRISTMAS HAIKU _ The winner of this year's Christmas Haiku
Contest:
</P>
<P>
   Who is Pokeman?
</P>
<P>
   And why am I fighting for
</P>
<P>
   Cards in Japanese?
</P>
<P>
   CHRISTMAS TREE, PERFECTLY STRAIGHT _ See ``Christmas
</P>
<P>
   Mythology.''
</P>
<P>
   ELECTO-TREE _ Although this product was a useful tool for
training cats to respect holiday decorations, civil-liability
issues halted its manufacture.
</P>
<P>
   FOURTH WISE MAN _ Variously identified as Zeppo, Pete Best and
Shemp. An oddly persistent Christmas legend, which, like the rubber
cigar, is without scriptural basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``IT IS IRONIC AT THIS TIME OF GOODWILL TOWARD MAN ...''
</P>
<P>
   _ See ``Top 10 TV-News Lead-Ins'' under ``Christmas
Journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   LANDSAT RULE _ The Landsat Rule states that outdoor
</P>
<P>
   Christmas decorations are excessive if they show up in routine
satellite photos or confuse aircraft navigation.
</P>
<P>
   NEXT CHRISTMAS _ A mythical time when trees slip into their
stands and children are happy, clean and grateful. Teen-agers stay
home, children get their lines right in the pageant and everyone in
the photograph has his or her eyes open. Cards are mailed on time.
Credit is used responsibly. The last present is wrapped on Dec. 20
and everything is neatly boxed, labeled and stored by Jan.
</P>
<P>
   6.
</P>
<P>
   ORIENTAR (or-EE-en-TAR) _ When asked ``Where were the Three
Kings from?'' 80 percent of respondents say ``Orientar.'' Two
percent motion somewhere down the street.
</P>
<P>
   ORNAMENT-HOOK BALLS _ Nobody knows why metal
</P>
<P>
   Christmas ornament hooks entwine themselves into balls while in
storage. Mental health professionals urge you to spend 98 cents on
new hooks rather than attempting to undo them. Spray-paint the mass
and hang it on the tree.
</P>
<P>
   REINDEER GAMES _ Their exact nature remains obscure. Lack of
opposable thumbs would seem to rule out ``Tomb Raider.''
</P>
<P>
   VIRGINIA _ The best-known newspaper editorial in the history of
journalism appeared in the New York Sun in 1897. It was not about
peace or justice. It did not expose corruption. It assured a little
girl named Virginia that Santa Claus lives. The public has received
editorial page assurances with a degree of skepticism ever since.

<P>
   EDITOR'S NOTE: Five years ago, a father sat down to feed his
infant twin girls _ and something went terribly wrong. Now he's in
prison, his mother is raising his babies, and the twins no longer
match. One is healthy and smart.
</P>
<P>
   The other is broken. Michele Poole wants you to know why you
should never, ever shake a baby.
</P>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ ``Mom?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, Pumpkin?''
</P>
<P>
   ``How come you're always talking about Gabbi? How come you never
talk about me?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do! I talk about you all the time, Michele. Didn't you just
hear me talking about how great you're doing in your swimming
lessons?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, but you talk more about Gabbi.''
</P>
<P>
   Michele adjusts the rearview mirror, finds Little Michele's
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, honey. I'm sorry! You know what? Sometimes I have to talk
about Gabbi. Gabbi has a lot of appointments. She has a lot of
doctor's visits. So sometimes I talk about those. But I love
talking about you, too!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, how come you never call me baby? How come you always
call Gabbi baby, but not me?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do! I call you baby all the time!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, how come you never get mad at Gabbi? You just get mad at
me?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a little harder. Let me think about that. But you need
to tell me what you want at Burger King.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you talk about Gabbi, just make sure you talk about me,
too. Gabbi and me, Gabbi and me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gabbi and you, right?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right. 'Cause otherwise it isn't fair.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Vanilla milkshake.''
</P>
<P>
   It's time to go, and it's pouring. Little Michele can't find her
sneakers, and it's pouring. The house key isn't working, and it's
pouring. The buzzer in the van won't shut up, and it's still
pouring.
</P>
<P>
   It's Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   It's chaos.
</P>
<P>
   It's therapy day.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Springsteen is playing in the waiting room.

edgy and dull and cut a six-inch valley through the middle of my
soul.'' END ITALIC
</P>
<P>
   Gabbi is wearing her lime-green dress and matching socks, and
Michele has parked her wheelchair so it faces the big wall mural
depicting a beautiful garden and a greenhouse. Gabbi, with her
near-blind, far-away stare, appears to be entranced by the picture,
and watching her you think she is exactly like those hothouse
plants: If she isn't cared for and loved and watered and fed and
tended to just so, she won't survive.
</P>
<P>
   Last time at the therapist's, Little Michele and her mother were
trying to decide who would go in first when Little Michele said,
``OK, I'll go, but I'm taking Gabbi with me'' _ and then she
scooted her sister's wheelchair down the hall and into the
therapist's office and closed the door. Since everything at the
therapist's is confidential, nobody really knows what was said, not
even Big Michele. But she would pay good money.
</P>
<P>
   The therapy trips began after Little Michele turned 4 and
started asking who her ``real'' mom was. Big Michele wasn't sure
how to answer. How much should she say? Everything's so
complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, on Sundays, the twins visit Monica, who was just 18
when she had them. The visits _ at the other grandparents' home _
are friendly, but tentative. Little Michele sometimes calls Monica
mom, and sometimes just Monica. And Monica is ambivalent, too.
After Gabbi got hurt, she tried to get the girls back, but then,
when they were 2, when George was in prison and she was dancing in
bars to pay the bills, she relented and signed the adoption papers.
</P>
<P>
   Michele and Rod promised she could see the twins whenever she
wanted, and they held their word. But nobody has figured out how to
explain all this to Little Michele.
</P>
<P>
   For now she knows only part of the story. She knows Gabbi hurt
her head, knows she's different, knows she goes to special schools.
But she does not know her daddy did it, does not understand the
intricacies of a baby's brain, does not realize Gabbi will be like
this the rest of her life, even when Michele and Rodney are too old
to care for her. Then, Little Michele will have to look out for her
sister, but she doesn't know that either.
</P>
<P>
   The hardest questions are yet to come: Why would a daddy want to
hurt a baby? Why would God allow such a thing? Why did Gabbi get
hurt and I didn't? Was it my fault? Will she ever get better?
</P>
<P>
   ``I need an outsider to help me with all that,'' Michele says.
</P>
<P>
   It's funny, but recently, Little Michele added some ``ghost
friends'' to her family. Their names are Billy, Sadie and Gabbi.
Big Michele loves that she included Gabbi, because Little Michele
and her ghost friends play games together, and that's more than
Gabbi gets to do in real life.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's one more thing to talk to the therapist about.
</P>
<P>
   And then, there's this:
</P>
<P>
   After Gabbi got hurt, doctors examined Little Michele and found
evidence of retinal hemorrhaging _ a sign that she, too, had been
shaken.
</P>
<P>
   So, while she is in many ways precocious, Little Michele will
always be under her parents' microscope. Sometimes children who
have been shaken as babies seem to be fine, and then later, in
school, they develop problems. Trouble concentrating. Erratic
behavior. Learning disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   So she's praying. But she's also on guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never do the crying thing,'' Michele says on the way home,
but what she means is, she dabs away the tears before they have a
chance to roll down her cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   Finally _ after months of Thursdays _ something big happened.
</P>
<P>
   It was summer, and, for the heck of it, Michele's brother Ken
threw a party, a big turkey dinner in the middle of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody came. Michele and Rodney. The twins. Michele's sister,
Ellen. Her brother, Scott. Her mother, Vivian.
</P>
<P>
   There was good china, and on the plates the stiff, white napkins
stood up like little hats.
</P>
<P>
   Little Michele sat next to Rodney. Gabbi sat next to Big
Michele. Everybody held hands during grace.
</P>
<P>
   And then _ Michele couldn't help herself. She scooped a bit of
mashed potatoes onto a spoon. She put the spoon to Gabbi's lips.
Gabbi's tongue moved around a bit. The potatoes sat for a moment in
her mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Then she ate them.
</P>
<P>
   Michele held her breath as Gabbi swallowed, but down they went,
and for an encore, Gabbi enjoyed a few bites of butternut squash.
</P>
<P>
   When the speech therapist heard, she said, ``Oh, Gabbidoodle!
You're breaking my heart!''
</P>
<P>
   School.
</P>
<P>
   Once, Gabbi got to go to The Little Place with Little Michele
for a day. There was a fire drill, and the teacher wheeled Gabbi
outside, and the kids gathered around, rubbing her arms, petting
her, really, and one girl remarked that Gabbi's soft hands felt
like gloves. But then the children noticed Gabbi's legs _ stiff as
a toy soldier's _ and one of them said, ``Gosh, doesn't she look
just like a statue?''
</P>
<P>
   Little Michele didn't say much at all. She hung back as her
classmates looked at Gabbi, and then at Little Michele, and then
back at Gabbi.
</P>
<P>
   And then they asked the teacher what one girl was to the other.
Were Michele and Gabbi sisters? The teacher thought for a moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' she finally said. ``They're twins. But one has dark
hair and one has light hair, and that's the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, since that's not the whole truth, Gabbi goes to her own
school _ the Potentials charter school in Riviera Beach. On
interview day, Michele put Gabbi in her best yellow dress and took
off, passing warehouses and a half dozen little churches with signs
advertising hope and a new life.
</P>
<P>
   Gabbi got hers.
</P>
<P>
   At Potentials, she and 22 other students get all the important
therapies _ speech, vision, occupational, physical _ and plenty of
classroom time. And the school's philosophy is: Don't worry about
what a child can't do. Find out what she can do. Because children
like Gabbi can surprise you.
</P>
<P>
   Michele knows this. She remembers when she put Gabbi under a
baby gym when she was 16 months old. A child as severely impaired
as Gabbi should not have been able to figure out how to manipulate
the gym to make the cat meow or the bear growl or the dog bark _
but one night Michele was sitting at her computer with her back to
Gabbi and she heard animal sounds.
</P>
<P>
   The next day she took Gabbi and the baby gym to Easter Seals and
everybody cheered. Gabbi was learning to push the levers that made
the sounds she loved. And if she could do that, couldn't she do
more?
</P>
<P>
   Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Gabbi joins in circle time. Her favorite toy is an
electronic piano with light-up keys. She loves to paint, and she
can sit up with assistance, and just the other day (Michele
couldn't believe it) she used the toilet for the first time. The
teachers have big goals for Gabbi. They want her to recognize
herself in the mirror, learn to wash her face and brush her teeth
with help, concentrate for longer periods of time, reach out to
another child, accept a touch, express a wish.
</P>
<P>
   Gabbi is making fine progress. Her report card says she is
giggling more than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, in the mountains of North Carolina, where she has
a summer place, Michele visited a studio where people like Gabbi
learn to make suspenders _ and get paid for it. It's not the money
that counts so much; it's the companionship, the glow that comes
with accomplishment. Everyone has a task at which they can excel.
One fellow comes in a few hours a day just to run his fingers over
the material, because feeling material is what he's good at.
</P>
<P>
   The man who showed Michele around said Gabbi might do well
there, someday. And at first she cried, thinking of her
granddaughter at a long table, worrying over a piece of elastic
while the radio played.
</P>
<P>
   But then she thought: Maybe it's enough, learning to make a
clasp or a hook, something to hold up a pair of pants, and taking
pride in it.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's enough working with friends and feeling useful.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's enough just having a place in life.
</P>
<P>
   In September, the twins celebrated their fifth birthday with a
Winnie the Pooh theme. Little Michele got Happenin' Hair Barbie,
and Gabbi successfully licked the ranch dressing off some carrot
sticks. And after Little Michele blew out the candles, one of the
guests, a girl of 9 who has a disabled brother, said, ``Gabbi and
Nicholas are just like everybody else, except they can't do
everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``But who cares? Because you still love them so much.''
</P>
<P>
   In October, Michele got herself on TV news. It took a little
chutzpah, calling up Channel 5 and inviting them over like that.
But, in nearby counties, two babies had just been shaken, and this
was Domestic Violence Month, and so, as she put it, ``I just
couldn't keep my mouth shut.'' And that's how she got the lead
story. Anyone who tuned in saw Little Michele riding her hot-pink
bike around the living room, and Big Michele doing her
demonstration with the egg and the bowl, and then they saw Gabbi in
her lime-green dress _ pushing the yellow button with everything
she had.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Michele flew to Texas, to meet with the Shaken Baby
Alliance, a prevention group that wants to start affiliations in
every state. It is a big job. Somebody is going to have to stand up
and shout. Travel the country. Stop in big cities and little towns.
Do radio spots and community lectures. Somebody is going to have
load up the twins. Plan an itinerary.
</P>
<P>
   And that is why, at the end of the Pooles' driveway, tucked
under the pines, a 38-foot Winnebago waits, ready for The New
Millennium Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Michele and Rodney bought it from a paralyzed race car driver,
and he said it was a good rig for a hard road.
</P>
<P>
   It's dark.
</P>
<P>
   After dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Little Michele's singing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twinkle, twinkle little star . . . how I wonder what you are .
. . up above the world so high . . . like a diamond in the sky.''
</P>
<P>
   Gabbi has fallen asleep. Little Michele kisses her cheek.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's you, Gabbi,'' she says. ``That star is you.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE: Five years ago, a father sat down to feed his
infant twin girls _ and something went terribly wrong. Now he's in
prison, his mother is raising his babies, and the twins no longer
match. One is healthy and smart.
</P>
<P>
   The other is broken. Michele Poole wants you to know why you
should never, ever shake a baby.
</P>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ June 20, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   It is a hot, sweaty, shorts-and-bathing suit Saturday in the
twins' third year, and Gabbi and Michele have just been appointed
goodwill ambassadors for the local Easter Seals society. As Little
Ambassadors, the twins have an obligation to spread the word.
Sometimes, they dress up in adorable matching outfits ad have
their pictures taken for brochures, and sometimes they appear at
fund-raisers, where, as Michele puts it, ``I hate to say they're on
display, but, yup, they're on display.''
</P>
<P>
   On this day, the day before Father's Day, the good cause is up
the road in West Palm Beach, so Michele loads the twins into the
van and heads north to Howard Park and the Festival for Fatherhood.
She plops Gabbi down in a baby bouncer under the spreading branches
of a ficus tree, picks up Little Michele in her right arm and her
baby-doll prop in her left _ and then she is ready to make her
pitch to the straggly but attentive group of dads and the young
sons who accompany them.
</P>
<P>
   This is Little Michele, she tells the crowd. See how sparkly she
is? How smart? She's what Gabbi could be if Gabbi weren't Gabbi.
</P>
<P>
   And this is Gabbi. She was born 100 percent healthy. Oh gosh,
she was just beautiful. Before she got hurt, she was just like
Little Michele.
</P>
<P>
   The young boys in striped shirts and cut-offs crane their necks
to get a peek at the Little Ambassadors, the hurt one and the
healthy one, and then they repeat after Michele in clear, high
voices, ``Never, ever shake a baby!'' And at supper that night they
ask their daddies if shaking a baby can really do that, mess up
your brains that way.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the truth, Michele says:
</P>
<P>
   At first, you don't want to go out and tell people what happened
to your family. Don't want to talk about your brain-damaged
granddaughter. Don't want to show the world pictures of your twins.
</P>
<P>
   You don't want to get up and give a speech to a bunch of
strangers. Don't want to show them how Gabbi eats through a tube.
Don't want to tell them how before she got the tube, she was
inconsolable, and you even tried breast-feeding, but nothing came
out.
</P>
<P>
   And you certainly don't want to tell them your son did this, and
you're not sure why, but he was trouble all his life. Only _ he's
your son, so of course you love him.
</P>
<P>
   No.
</P>
<P>
   You want to draw the curtains and curl up in bed and pull the
covers over your head and maybe take a sleeping pill and disconnect
the phone and tell your husband you'll be OK, when really you don't
think you'll ever be. You want to, but you don't. Because you have
two babies now. And when you look at the healthy one you are
reminded of what the sick one could be, and when you look at the
sick one you are reminded of other babies in other places.
</P>
<P>
   Each year in America _ you know this because you've read
everything on the subject _ hundreds of babies are shaken. Some
live with brain damage; about a quarter die. So you watch the news
and you get on the Internet, and you find other people who have had
their hearts broken by the exact same thing, and some you call, and
some you only think about, day after day, until you want to shove
every last case from your mind. But you can't. Because this is
personal. The rest of the country might read, then quickly forget,
the headlines about the British nanny, but you are stroking Gabbi's
curls.
</P>
<P>
   So, no.
</P>
<P>
   You don't draw the curtains, you don't stay in bed, you don't
take the sleeping pill. There is too much to do.
</P>
<P>
   And if you don't do it _ well, then, will nothing positive come
of this at all?
</P>
<P>
   So now here she is, schlepping around Florida with her egg and
her doll. And Gabbi.
</P>
<P>
   She puts on her blue suit and heels and the red-and-silver
shaken-baby ribbon she bought for a dollar from a woman in New
Hampshire, and she hunts and pecks her way through city streets and
rural roads until she finds the right meeting room in the right
tucked-away shopping center.
</P>
<P>
   No audience is too small. No banquet hall too dumpy. She does
schools, halfway houses, parenting groups, anything. She's not
above drumming up her own business, not too bashful to call some
group she has barely heard of and say, in her best
politician/saleswoman's voice, ``This is Michele Poole. I give
talks on Shaken Baby Syndrome. When can you fit me in?''
</P>
<P>
   Once she's in the door, she doesn't need notes. The words pour
out: Anyone can shake a baby. Not just troubled kids like my son,
George. Not just people messed up on drugs. Not just poor people or
dumb people or mentally ill people. People who shake babies are
just . . . people. Some are angry, some ignorant. Many are dads, a
few are moms. Some are boyfriends, some baby-sitters. Afterwards,
some are sorry, some are not.
</P>
<P>
   At the close of every speech, she extends an invitation: If
anyone knows somebody who might be at risk to shake a baby, she
will meet that person anytime anywhere. She will explain that a
baby's brain is exceedingly fragile, that her head is large and her
neck muscles weak, that when you shake or slam something that
small, her head snaps to and fro like a Ping-Pong ball and her
brain ricochets around her skull and _ well, God, look at Gabbi.
</P>
<P>
   So far, no one has taken her up on her offer to meet one-on-one.
</P>
<P>
   And you know what?
</P>
<P>
   Some groups don't even want her, or the Little Ambassadors.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I press the issue, they tell me shaken babies are just
too depressing.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I tell them, that's exactly why you need me. That's the
whole damn point.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what would be great?'' Michele says one day while
counting the number of handicapped spaces in the Dunkin' Donuts
plaza _ an activist's obsession.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to get a big motor home, drive around the country.
No kidding! Gabbi's a great little traveler, and Little Michele
loves camping. I'd stop at every big city and little town I passed
through, and I'd get on the radio and speak at schools and maybe
get into the hospitals to talk to the moms or the nurses. I'd tell
them _ I'd show them _ what it means to shake a baby. I could get
sponsors. I could do parks and community centers. Libraries. PTAs.
I brought this up with Rodney, and he said, `Go for it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I even have a title picked out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The New Millennium Make-a-Difference Shaken Baby Awareness and
Prevention Tour.''
</P>
<P>
   OK.
</P>
<P>
   Sure.
</P>
<P>
   It's a big dream.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes you need a big dream to pick your spirits up off
the floor _ where they have fallen in the course of just getting
by.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriela Sabrina Poole was born at Bethesda Memorial Hospital,
Boynton Beach, Fla., on Sept. 4, 1994, and she was perfect.
</P>
<P>
   She came, literally, on the heels of her sister, Michele Marie,
who arrived minutes earlier and was named after Big Michele. Gabbi
weighed 6 pounds, 12 ounces, and Little Michele a tad less. Because
they are fraternal twins _ born of different eggs and sharing
approximately half their genes _ it was difficult, back then, to
predict how alike in appearance or temperament they might be one
day. And now, of course, it is impossible.
</P>
<P>
   But what is it about twins? Even fraternal ones sometimes seem
to share membership in a secret society, and it is this kinship
that has fascinated parents and researchers alike. In her recent
book, ``Entwined Lives,'' Nancy Segal, a psychologist and fraternal
twin herself, includes a picture of the British ``Giggle Twins,''
Barbara Herbert and Daphne Goodship. ``Each twin inspires
continuous laughter in the other,'' Segal explains in the caption,
``but what sets them off is a mystery to everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, that sounds familiar. Even though Gabbi is Gabbi _ or
perhaps because Gabbi is Gabbi _ Little Michele has figured out a
special way to communicate with her. In the van or in the kitchen _
or when Gabbi is sleepy in bed and Little Michele climbs in with an
armful of Barbies _ she fills her lungs with air and emits a
high-pitched squeak and, almost always, Gabbi will summon herself
from her quiet reverie to respond with a fit of giggles. Gabbi
giggling is a lovely, lovely sight.
</P>
<P>
   The twins are never more twin-like _ never more one _ than at
this moment, and if Big Michele ever writes a book of her own, she
will be sure to mention the squeak and the giggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like there's an invisible cord between them,'' she says.
``Little Michele pulls, and it just brings Gabbi right out of
herself.''

 &HT;    It parks, but will it start?
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The trouble with valets? They don't get enough
experience parking pieces of junk.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, they can handle a Ferrari. But do they know how to deal
with, say, a '73 Pinto blowing smoke out the back end? Nope.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, on Friday night I drove up to the front of
three fancy restaurants in downtown Austin and asked the valets to
park a butt-ugly '82 model Toyota with National Geographic photos
covering the entire body on the passenger side.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a nice set of wheels you've got there,'' said Cory
</P>
<P>
   Rohde, a valet at Sullivan's Steak House, as he opened the car
door for me. Maybe he was being complimentary because I was
leaving.
</P>
<P>
   See, Austin has become such an upscale town that we suddenly
have a number of restaurants downtown that feature guys in uniforms
who will park your car for $4 or $5, plus tip. In fact, we now have
so many valet parking services downtown that the City Council has
approved new fees and regulations for them.
</P>
<P>
   How would these valets deal with a real pile of auto parts?
</P>
<P>
   To find out, I borrowed a Toyota that used to belong to Crazy
Carl Hickerson, former perennial unsuccessful hippie candidate for
Austin's City Council.
</P>
<P>
   Crazy Carl transferred the National Geographic pictures to the
surface of the car through a crafts method known as decoupage. He
covered the passenger side of the car completely to try to hide the
damage that occurred when the car was, as Carl put it, ``rolled.''
</P>
<P>
   On the car you can see pictures of Winston Churchill, Queen
Elizabeth I and Eisenhower. A tiny blue light comes on when you
turn the air-conditioner knob. The air conditioner, however, does
not come on. A metal Cadillac emblem decorates the glove
compartment door. The car has no shocks. It is like riding in a
rock. Over the years, the car has developed its own anti-theft
system. Sometimes the ignition key locks up.
</P>
<P>
   Carl says that one time when he was driving the car on the Drag,
some college boys pulled up next to him, and one of them hollered
out the window, ``Hey, Charter can help.'' The college boy was
referring to Charter Lane, a drug rehab hospital.
</P>
<P>
   For my valet parking experiment, my friend Danny Bennett rode
along in a Federal Witness Protection Program T-shirt. We had a toy
called The Surprising Arm sticking out of the car trunk. The
Surprising Arm is a rubber hand attached to a sleeve.
</P>
<P>
   For the evening, I wore a pair of blue- and white-striped
overalls, along with a gimme cap from The Too Damn Friendly Bar in
Johnson City, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   I knew one thing: I was not overdressed.
</P>
<P>
   It was shortly after 6 p.m. Friday when Danny and I pulled up in
front of Louie's 106. A group of four or five valets was gathered
on the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   The valets were all over this Toyota. I thought they were going
to fight over who was going to get to park it. It was as if they
were thinking, ``Thank God. Not another stinking Maserati.'' ``I
like the hand,'' one of the valets said. Another began running his
fingers over the National Geographic photos on the car.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you gotta do to offend somebody in this town?'' my
friend Danny asked me, as an aside.
</P>
<P>
   For $4 and a $1 tip, one of the valets drove the Toyota over to
a nearby mall parking garage and left it on the fifth level. But
when a valet returned to the car to drive it back, he couldn't get
the key to turn over. So a second valet sprinted across the street
to the parking garage to try to start the car. The key still
wouldn't budge.
</P>
<P>
   I got her going, though, and we headed off for Sullivan's Steak
House. We easily had the most interesting car in front of
Sullivan's. The rest of the cars parked by the curb were your
typical boring Jaguars, Corvettes and Porsches.
</P>
<P>
   Although the valets at Sullivan's parked our car for $4 and $1
tip with no questions or extremely funny looks, their attitude
toward the car was less than enthusiastic. ``Well, it could use a
little work,'' said Robert Tapia, 21. ``I especially liked the
Cadillac emblem. ``
</P>
<P>
   As we prepared to leave, the Sullivan's valets got our keys
mixed up with the others in the key box.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have a white Lexus?'' one of the valets asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, but we'll take it,'' I said. I wanted to be the only guy
in Austin driving a Lexus in a pair of overalls.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't get the Lexus, but we did limp on over to Ruth's Chris
Steak House, a really tasty steak place where you have to take out
a bank loan to feed a party of four.
</P>
<P>
   The valets at Ruth's Chris charged us $5 to park the car, and I
tipped $1. Is this the ugliest car that's ever been here? I asked
Troy Schmidt, the head valet. ``There's one driving around with the
little toy dinosaurs on it,'' he said guardedly. But do the little
toy dinosaurs ever stop here? I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said.

 &HT;    Young and old in Hollywood won't get dressed without them
 &HT;    By Staci Sturrock
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The name ``Nolan Miller'' isn't as
well-known as, say, Calvin Klein or Tommy Hilfiger.
</P>
<P>
   But, guaranteed, Americans are familiar with the Miller look
whether they know it or not.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan Miller is the man who dressed Mary Ann in gingham for
``Gilligan's Island.'' He put Peggy Lipton in hip huggers for ``The
Mod Squad.'' And he created those linebacker-wide shoulder pads for
Krystle Carrington on ``Dynasty.''
</P>
<P>
   When TV costuming budgets began to shrink, Miller shifted his
focus to developing couture and ready-to-wear lines and dressing
old-guard celebrities: Lauren Bacall, Angie Dickinson and
Ann-Margret, among them. His protege, Mark Zunino, handles the
clothing chores for Hollywood's younger set _ stars such as Heather
Locklear, Halle Berry, Courteney Cox Arquette and Shannen Doherty.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, 64, and Zunino, 37, recently presented some of their
past and present designs at a luncheon fashion show benefiting the
National Parkinson Foundation. In the big tent at Mar-a-Lago, they
sat down to talk for a few minutes before the grazing and gazing
began:
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who's your favorite celebrity to dress?
</P>
<P>
   A: (Miller): ``If I say Sophia Loren, Joan Collins is going to
kill me. If I say Joan Collins, Sophia Loren is going to kill me. .
. . I loved dressing Elizabeth Taylor because she was my fantasy
growing up. When she finally called, I thought I had died and gone
to heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   (Zunino): ``Heather Locklear. She is so sweet. She is like a
young Ann-Margret. They are to the heart, to the bone, the nicest,
sweetest people. And they both have great bodies.'' (Locklear wore
a Zunino-designed gown when she married rocker Ritchie Sambora.)
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who is on your wish list?
</P>
<P>
   A: (Miller): Catherine Deneuve. ``The ones that I really wanted
to dress are all gone now: Princess Diana, Grace Kelly . . . ``
</P>
<P>
   (Zunino): Winona Ryder. ``I love her look. She has a very
demure, sophisticated look, but there's a wild streak running
through her.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: How is dressing new Hollywood different from outfitting the
gals in the old days?
</P>
<P>
   A: (Zunino): ``The studios used to dress the actresses from head
to toe. They were brought up with that, and they expect that. Young
Hollywood has not a clue. (But) they have fun with fashion. They're
not afraid to try things. If they try something and it doesn't
work, big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   (Miller): ``There aren't many stars left _ people who act and
look like stars. It's a different world. Not too many people can
create that aura today.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: How has designing for TV changed since ``Dynasty?''
</P>
<P>
   A: (Zunino): ``(On Dynasty) it was an endless budget. Everything
was sable, cashmere. Now the money is much tighter.''
</P>
<P>
   (Miller): ``I'm still trying to live down the beads and glitz of
the ``Dynasty'' era. . . . To have a show like that! With beautiful
people who wear your clothes well, and I had the money to do it . .
. `` A typical episode's costuming budget was $35,000, but Miller
says the budget could climb to $100,000. ``It'll never happen
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Would you rather be stranded on a desert isle with Mary Ann
or Ginger?
</P>
<P>
   A: (Miller): ``Certainly not Mary Ann. That stupid Mary Ann went
on a three-hour tour without a trunk of clothes!''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why did Ginger have so many dresses, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   A: (Miller): ``I always tell people that she was a showgirl on
her way to Vegas, so she was carrying everything with her.''

 &HT;    The world is her shopping mall,
 &HT;    By Loretta Grantham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Maribel Alvarez recently bet on a
Dolphins game.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they won, my friend said she'd pay for me and another
friend to spend a week at Doral Saturnia,'' she says, referring to
the swank Miami spa where robe-clad socialites agonize over whether
to schedule a Swedish massage or shiatsu. ``If they lost, I'd do
some work for her for free.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, Maribel's going to Miami. And her pal's going to be out
about six grand.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS) I won five bucks on a Fins game once. And a
beer. (END ITALICS)
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: Maribel frolics with rich folks. Really rich folks.
The echelon whose wish list includes 10-carat radiant-cut diamonds,
original Renoirs and hideaways on the Riviera. Even a 1713 heirloom
rug once owned by the queen of Denmark. (And you thought your
family was tough to shop for.)
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of Cuban immigrants who sent her to boarding school
in Switzerland (''Le Rosey alumni are a key part of my network''),
Maribel is a global-scale human eBay, the pickiest of purveyors for
those with discriminating tastes.
</P>
<P>
   She'll also woo Yugoslavian royalty to show up at your cocktail
party. Or help you fill a banquet table for 10 at a charity ball.
All for a fee.
</P>
<P>
   Today, though, it's just us two at Bice, where Maribel orders
``seafood salad, no potatoes'' in Italian between puffs on a Benson
&AMP; Hedges. She also speaks French and Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   About eight months ago, Maribel _ a divorced mom of three _
created a career out of her jet-set Rolodex, launching Altima
International, a high-end concierge-type company in Palm Beach.
Next month, she'll open her upstairs Worth Avenue office with a
splashy soiree featuring ``a caviar sampling'' (beluga and sevruga
and osetra, oh my!) and all the top-shelf vodka you can guzzle.
</P>
<P>
   Her connections come from worldwide travel; serving as a
diplomat for Costa Rica (her dad dealt in oil there); and popping
up at every party from here to the Hamptons to Nepal (where she
bought the wooden-bead prayer bracelet she wears alongside her gold
Cartier watch).
</P>
<P>
   Altima's rates vary, but consultations run $125 an hour.
Marketing for a major department store, $2,000 a month. Locating a
rare painting, a percentage of the selling price (which is
determined by the selling price, usually six figures).
</P>
<P>
   ``Money is no object to many of my clients,'' says Maribel, 40,
in an Armani suit she scored on sale at Loehmann's. ``But what they
do demand is the best possible deal. That's where I come in. I do
the homework.''
</P>
<P>
   Because when you're a time-pressed tycoon, there just ain't
enough hours in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Says a client: ``She's very straightforward in business and very
knowledgeable. Everyone knows her.''
</P>
<P>
   He recently bought a $2.5 million warehouse with the help of
Maribel's cohort, Realtor Maura Landers. Then there's the art
(''$100,000 and up'') and jewelry (''$50,000 and up'').
</P>
<P>
   ``I pass these things along to her,'' the entrepreneur says,
requesting anonymity (which Maribel ensures). ``There are certain
things I just don't want to be bothered with.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS) Whew! Me, neither. Last time I hunted down a
hangar for my Gulfstream V, it was SUCH a hassle. (END ITALICS)
</P>
<P>
   Despite her links to the lofty, Maribel puts on no airs. Nor
pantyhose, nor earrings. And makeup is minimal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious I don't do much with my hair,'' she says,
shrugging. ``But I don't fuss with that kind of stuff. I put on a
baseball cap, and I'm there.''
</P>
<P>
   Driving her 5-year-old, beat-up blue Toyota 4-Runner. (''If you
saw it, you'd die.'')
</P>
<P>
   Maribel, who has two sons at home _ ages 11 and 4, and a
daughter, 17, at Le Rosey _ is usually at her desk by 7 in the
morning for phone calls ad naseum. Then a meeting. Then more phone
calls. Then more meetings. You get the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Today, however, she's sans cell phone so that we may eat in
peace. But the restaurant itself is noisy, still bustling with the
lunch crowd although it's nearly 3 p.m. on a weekday. No
clock-punchers here.
</P>
<P>
   Maribel, meanwhile, is one of those folks who had a privileged
upbringing but doesn't fully realize it, which is part of what
makes her so likable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't grow up with all the money in the world,'' she says,
referring to her parents and two older brothers, who left Cuba for
the States in 1959. ``We had some. But they had to sell the yacht
to send me to boarding school. I was always the poorest in the
group.''
</P>
<P>
   Widowed at 25 by her first husband, an attorney, Maribel went on
to wed an aeronautical designer. The couple, seeking a more serene
spot for the kids, moved to Palm Beach in the early '80s, then
divorced in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Her third marriage _ to a real estate investor _ ended last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having children is wonderful, but I'm just not good at
marriage,'' Maribel says. ``Maybe I'm too independent. But I'm
still good friends with my exes.''
</P>
<P>
   And good friends with Gino, our suave maitre 'd, who glides over
to ask if we wish to conclude our lunch with cappuccino. (''No
cafe,'' she replies.)
</P>
<P>
   And good friends with Ashton de Peyster _ as in Northeast
banking fortune (even his name sounds rich!) _ who yells hello from
across the street as we walk down Worth.
</P>
<P>
   When she isn't scavenging for stuff most of us can neither
afford nor pronounce, she heads to the mountains (''I love Peru,
but I'm thinking about India'') or watches Dan Marino with her
sons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a huge Dolphins fan!'' gushes Maribel, who's on a waiting
list for her visit to Doral.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS) If only she could help Marino find someone to
catch the ball. (END ITALICS)

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDS: Take 1 of two takes.)
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read recently that a chunk of ancient ocean floor was found
1,550 miles beneath the Earth's crust. How was that discovery made?
Surely no drill could reach that deep.
</P>
<P>
   A: You're right, a drill (or ``corer'') isn't involved, because
it could go no deeper than 4-5 miles. Earle Holland of Ohio State
University explained that scientists send sound waves through the
Earth's mantle layer. That way, they can determine the distances
involved by studying the time and trajectory of the return of the
sound waves to seismic monitoring stations.
</P>
<P>
   Acoustic energy travels through different types of mantle
material at different speeds, Holland added. The warmer the
material, the longer it takes for sound energy to pass through.
</P>
<P>
   Using supercomputers to analyze the travel times and paths of
thousands of seismic waves, seismologists can create a
three-dimensional image _ similar to a CAT scan of a human body _
of the Earth's interior. That technique gave them the reading of
1,550 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm going to be in Washington on New Year's Eve. Some time
ago, I heard about a big celebration, but I haven't seen anything
since and can't find a source of information. Can you help?
</P>
<P>
   A: The America's Millennium celebration on the National Mall
will begin at 11 a.m. Dec. 31. President Clinton and first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton and others will participate in a ceremony
that will include concerts and the unveiling of the National
Millennium Time Capsule. Lectures, demonstrations and performances
are scheduled at Smithsonian Institution museums.
</P>
<P>
   A ``colossal'' New Year's Eve gala at the Lincoln Memorial,
hosted by Will Smith, will focus on American music of the century
and will include appearances by Trisha Yearwood, Jessye Norman,
Kathleen Battle, Robert Duvall, the company of ``Stomp,'' and
bands, choirs and marching units of the U.S. armed forces. ``The
Unfinished Journey,'' an 18-minute Steven Spielberg film on the
highlights of the 20th century, will be shown for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The celebration culminates in a ``Midnight Moment,'' a high-tech
sound and light display. All events are free and open to the
public. Information is available online at http://160.111.100.129/
or by calling 1-888-294-2100.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is eggnog safe? My recipe calls for cream, sugar and
uncooked, beaten egg whites and yolks. Plus a gracious plenty of
rum, brandy or bourbon. Does the booze neutralize salmonella or
other possible contaminants?
</P>
<P>
   A: The alcohol doesn't neutralize the potential risk, said Chris
Rosenbloom, a professor at Georgia State University's department of
nutrition and a spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association.
But you can enjoy your holiday beverage without the questionable
raw eggs by using as a substitute a pasturized egg product, which
is packaged in cartons and usually can be found in the same
refrigerated section with eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Headline News recently reported on grades given to U.S.
cities to identify the best ones for raising children. How did they
rank? Where can I get more information?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're referring to the Kid Friendly Cities Report Card,
issued by Zero Population Growth. Check online at
www.zpg.org/kidfriendlycities/index.html or call 1-800-767-1956 for
information. As ``kid friendly'' implies, the report card is based
on data Zero Population Growth calls ``the best available'' on the
social, economic, educational and physical environment of U.S.
cities ``where our children live, grow, learn and play.''
</P>
<P>
   The rankings of 25 major cities: Seattle, A+; San Francisco, A;
San Jose, Calif., A-; San Diego, B+; Portland, Ore., Pittsburgh and
Denver, B; Minneapolis, B-; Boston, New York and Fort Worth, Texas.
C+; Phoenix, Tampa, Dallas and Houston, C; Philadelphia, Los
Angeles and Chicago, C-; Atlanta, Cleveland, Miami, Washington and
Detroit, D; and St. Louis and Baltimore, F.
</P>
<P>
   The ratings are based on such factors as teen births, infant
mortality rate, percentage of children in pre-school, student
dropout rate, violent crimes, property crimes, unemployment rate,
percentage of children in poverty, number of bad air days, public
transportation, and average commute.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A newspaper report about compensation for Nazi slave laborers
in Germany said some U.S. companies were contributing to a fund.
What companies?
</P>
<P>
   A: General Motors and Ford Motor Co. were the major ones whose
names have been made public, but it's said that ``up to 200''
American companies with German subsidiaries are potentially
involved. According to published accounts, they would create a fund
of roughly $500 million, separate from a $5.2 billion fund
negotiated by the German government, U.S. lawyers representing
former slave laborers, and more than 250 German companies.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, one of the first to be named in a class-action suit over
Nazi-era forced labor, has said it's still considering whether to
take part in a fund. General Motors is involved because of its
German subsidiary, Opel. GM bought the German carmarker, Adam Opel,
more than 60 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article about Elian Gonzales, the Cuban child involved in
a custody battle, mentioned the Joe DiMaggio complex at a Florida
hospital. It reminded me of a question I have long wondered about.
Did DiMaggio and Marilyn Monroe have a child during their brief
marriage?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. DiMaggio's only child, Joe DiMaggio Jr., was born to the
marriage of the late Yankee Clipper and his first wife, actress
Dorothy Arnold.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard recently that four U.S. M1-A1 tanks were lost during
the Persian Gulf War. Do you have any details?
</P>
<P>
   A: Military officials confirmed that ``about'' four of the M1-A1
battle tanks _ each costing $2.7 million _ were lost during the
Persian Gulf War. But specifics of their loss weren't made public.
</P>
<P>
   However, it was known that an explosion in July 1991at a U.S.
Army depot at the Blackhorse Camp in Doha, Kuwait, was devastating
to equipment and personnel. More than 50 vehicles, including 14
M1-A1 tanks and Bradley Fighting Vehicles fully loaded with
ammunition, were damaged or destroyed. Eight howitzers, valued at
$1.5 million each, also were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, officials said it was believed that the fire and
chain-reaction blasts were started by an electrical short on a
truck loaded with 155mm howitzer shells. A number of soldiers,
including 53 Americans, six Britons and a Canadian, were injured.
Most members of the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment at Blackhorse
were on desert maneuvers at the time of the blast.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was Mark McGwire's slugging percentage for this past
season, and how did it compare to whoever led the National League
and the Atlanta Braves in slugging percentages?
</P>
<P>
   A: Here are the NL's top 10 in slugging percentage, which will
answer all your questions, and a bit more:
</P>
<P>
   Larry Walker, Colorado Rockies, .710; Mark McGwire, St. Louis
Cardinals, .697; Sammy Sosa, Chicago Cubs, .635; Chipper Jones,
Atlanta Braves, .633; Brian Giles, Pittsburgh Pirates, .614;
Vladimir Guerrero, Montreal Expos, .600; Jeff Bagwell, Houston
Astros, .590; Todd Helton, Rockies, .587; Mike Piazza, New York
Mets, .575; Carl Everett, Astros, .571.
</P>
<P>
   A batter's slugging percentage is determined by dividing the
total number of bases of all base hits by the total number of times
at bat. Example: Say someone has 282 total bases and 440 at-bats.
Divide 282 by 440 to get the slugging percentage: .641.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the explanation for the ``X'' in Xmas?
</P>
<P>
   A: It has historical origins. The Greek word that gives us the
English word Christ begins with the letter chi, or X, leading some
scholars to believe that the X in Xmas symbolized the cross.
</P>
<P>
   Xmas has been used to symbolize the word Christ in English since
at least 1100, when it was recorded in ``Xianity,'' for
Christianity. The Old English word for Christian recorded in the
12th century ``Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' begins with an X, and the
word Xmas itself was used as early as the mid- 1500s.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand that Congress has ``borrowed'' large sums of
money from Social Security funds. Is this true?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's inaccurate to use the term ``borrowed,'' says Patti
Patterson of the Social Security Administration. A better word is
``invested,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   The trust funds in question are financial accounts in the U.S.
Treasury. Social Security and Medicare taxes, premiums and other
income are deposited into these accounts, and Social Security and
Medicare benefits are paid from them. There are four separate trust
funds: for Social Security, old-age and survivors insurance, and
disability insurance; and for Medicare, hospital insurance and
supplementary medical insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The only purposes for which these trust funds can be used are to
pay benefits and program administrative costs, according to the
agency. The trust funds hold money not needed in the current year
to pay those benefits and administrative costs so, as mandated by
law, the money is invested in special Treasury bonds guaranteed by
the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   A market rate of interest is paid to the trust funds on the
bonds they hold, and when those bonds reach maturity _ or are
needed to pay benefits _ the Treasury redeems them.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can fans send cards to wish Charles Schulz well? The
Peanuts creator is seriously ill and will discontinue the strip.
</P>
<P>
   A: Q&AMP;A printed the address not long ago, after it was reported
that Schulz had been treated for cancer, but it doesn't hurt to
repeat it now that he's said he is officially stopping. His
followers are legion, and he deserves an avalanche of fan mail.
Send cards to: Charles Schulz, One Snoopy Place, Santa Rosa, CA
95403-2665.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Vice President Al Gore went to divinity school after leaving
the Army. Which school, and for how long?
</P>
<P>
   A: After his Army enlistment ended in early autumn 1971, Gore _
who had graduated from Harvard in 1969 _ studied philosophy and
phenomenonoly at Vanderbilt University's Graduate School of
Religion in 1971-72. At the time, he also was working the night
shift at the Nashville Tennessean. Gore has explained before that
he went to divinity school ``to study the spiritual issues that
were most important to me at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1974 he enrolled in Vanderbilt's Law School, where he
remained for two years. He didn't obtain degrees from either the
divinity school or the law school.
</P>
<P>
   After learning in 1976 that Rep. Joe Evins (D-Tenn.) wouldn't be
running for re-election, Gore turned to a career in politics,
following in the footsteps of his father, Albert Gore Sr., a
Democrat who had served in the U.S. House and the U.S. Senate.
Young Al beat eight Democrats in the 1976 primary, won the general
election, and served four terms. In 1984, he was elected to the
Senate. You know the rest.

<P>
   Q: When did the minimum wage begin, and what was it? Can you
list the increases over the years?
</P>
<P>
   A: When federal minimum wage legislation went into effect in
October 1938 _ as established by the Fair Labor Standard Act of
that same year _ the minimum wage was 25 cents an hour. Amendments
have raised it many times since then. Here's the chronology:
</P>
<P>
   October 1939, 30 cents an hour; October 1945, 40 cents; January
1950, 75 cents; March 1956, $1; September 1961, $1.15; September
1963, $1.25; February 1967, $1.40; February 1968, $1.60; May 1974,
$2; January 1975, $2.10; January 1976, $2.30; January 1978, $2.65;
January 1979, $2.90; January 1980, $3.10; January 1981, $3.35;
April 1990, $3.80; April 1991, $4.25; October 1996, $4.75;
September 1997, $5.15. A minimum of $6.15 is proposed for 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When will we able to get information about tickets for the
Major League Baseball All-Star Game at Atlanta's Turner Field next
summer?
</P>
<P>
   A: Details aren't yet available. Ticket information will be
released in the spring, possibly around the time spring training
begins. The date of the game is July 11.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What should you do if you suspect your neighbors and/or their
children of stealing mail from your mailbox?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's the responsibility of the Postal Inspection Service, the
law enforcement branch of the U.S. Postal Service, to investigate
any crimes or suspected crimes related to the mail.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can I get into the audience for the Oprah Winfrey Show?
</P>
<P>
   A: You need to make a reservation for the Chicago studio taping

tapings beginning in September.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some news organizations have begun referring to Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright with the title ``Dr.'' When and where did
she receive a Ph.D., and in what area of study?
</P>
<P>
   A: Here is Albright's post-high school educational history. In
1959, she was awarded a B.A. with honors in political science from
Wellesley College in Massachusetts. She then studied at Johns
Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies in
Washington, and in 1968 earned both an M.A. and a certificate in
Russian studies from the Department of Public Law and Government at
Columbia University in New York.
</P>
<P>
   She received her Ph.D. in 1976, also from Columbia's Department
of Public Law and Government. Her doctoral dissertation was on the
part played by the press in the abortive attempt by Czech
dissidents in 1968 to loosen the grip of communism in their
country.
</P>
<P>
   Just after she received her Ph.D., Albright joined the staff of
Sen. Edmund Muskie as his chief legislative assistant. As she told
a writer at the time, ``That made it possible for Sen. Muskie to
introduce me as Dr. Albright, instead of Madeleine Albright, little
housewife.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her own studies, Albright has been a research
professor of international affairs and director of the Women in
Foreign Service Program at Georgetown University's School of
Foreign Service in Washington, where she taught undergraduate and
graduate courses in international affairs and in Central and
Eastern European politics. In 1981, she was a senior fellow in
Soviet and Eastern European affairs at Washington's 2 by 440 to get
the slugging percentage: .641.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the explanation for the ``X'' in Xmas?
</P>
<P>
   A: It has historical origins. The Greek word that gives us the
English word Christ begins with the letter chi, or X, leading some
scholars to believe that the X in Xmas symbolized the cross.
</P>
<P>
   Xmas has been used to symbolize the word Christ in English since
at least 1100, when it was recorded in ``Xianity,'' for
Christianity. The Old English word for Christian recorded in the
12th century ``Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' begins with an X, and the
word Xmas itself was used as early as the mid- 1500s.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand that Congress has ``borrowed'' large sums of
money from Social Security funds. Is this true?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's inaccurate to use the term ``borrowed,'' says Patti
Patterson of the Social Security Administration. A better word is
``invested,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   The trust funds in question are financial accounts in the U.S.
Treasury. Social Security and Medicare taxes, premiums and other
income are deposited into these accounts, and Social Security and
Medicare benefits are paid from them. There are four separate trust
funds: for Social Security, old-age and survivors insurance, and
disability insurance; and for Medicare, hospital insurance and
supplementary medical insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The only purposes for which these trust funds can be used are to
pay benefits and program administrative costs, according to the
agency. The trust funds hold money not needed in the current year
to pay those benefits and administrative costs so, as mandated by
law, the money is invested in special Treasury bonds guaranteed by
the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   A market rate of interest is paid to the trust funds on the
bonds they hold, and when those bonds reach maturity _ or are
needed to pay benefits _ the Treasury redeems them.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can fans send cards to wish Charles Schulz well? The
Peanuts creator is seriously ill and will discontinue the strip.
</P>
<P>
   A: Q&AMP;A printed the addrey. Which school, and for how long?
</P>
<P>
   A: After his Army enlistment ended in early autumn 1971, Gore _
who had graduated from Harvard in 1969 _ studied philosophy and
phenomenonoly at Vanderbilt University's Graduate School of
Religion in 1971-72. At the time, he also was working the night
shift at the Nashville Tennessean. Gore has explained before that
he went to divinity school ``to study the spiritual issues that
were most important to me at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1974 he enrolled in Vanderbilt's Law School, where he
remained for two years. He didn't obtain degrees from either the
divinity school or the law school.
</P>
<P>
   After learning in 1976 that Rep. Joe Evins (D-Tenn.) wouldn't be
running for re-election, Gore turned to a career in politics,
following in the footsteps of his father, Albert Gore Sr., a
Democrat who had served in the U.S. House and the U.S. Senate.
Young Al beat eight Democrats in the 1976 primary, won the general
election, and served four terms. In 1984, he was elected to the
Senate. You know the rest.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: When did the minimum wage begin, and what was it? Can you
list the increases over the years?
</P>
<P>
   A: When federal minimum wage legislation went into effect in
October 1938 _ as established by the Fair Labor Standard Act of
that same year _ the minimum wage was 25 cents an hour. Amendments
have raised it many times since then. Here's the chronology:
</P>
<P>
   October 1939, 30 cents an hour; October 1945, 40 cents; January
1950, 75 cents; March 1956, $1; September 1961, $1.15; September
1963, $1.25; February 1967, $1.40; February 1968, $1.60; May 1974,
$2; January 1975, $2.10; January 1976, $2.30; January 1978, $2.65;
January 1979, $2.90; January 1980, $3.10; January 1981, $3.35;
April 1990, $3.80; April 1991, $4.25; October 1996, $4.75;
September 1997, $5.15. A minimum of $6.15 is proposed for 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When will we able to get information about tickets for the
Major League Baseball All-Star Game at Atlanta's Turner Field next
summer?
</P>
<P>
   A: Details aren't yet available. Ticket information will be
released in the spring, possibly around the time spring training
begins. The date of the game is July 11.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What should you do if you suspect your neighbors and/or their
children of stealing mail from your mailbox?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's the responsibility of the Postal Inspection Service, the
law enforcement branch of the U.S. Postal Service, to investigate
any crimes or suspected crimes related to the mail.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can I get into the audience for the Oprah Winfrey Show?
</P>
<P>
   A: You need to make a reservation for the Chicago studio taping
by calling 312-591-9222 between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. Chicago (Central
Standard) time. Tickets aren't available by mail or e-mail, and
walk-ins aren't allowed. The program generally is taped at 9 a.m.
and noon (CST) on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays. Days and
times of taping are subject to change.
</P>
<P>
   Audience members must be 16 or older. Anyone younger than 18

<P>
   Q: Some news organizations have begun referring to Secretary of

she receive a Ph.D., and in what area of study?
</P>
<P>
   A: Here is Albright's post-high school educational history. In
1959, she was awarded a B.A. with honors in political science from
Wellesley College in Massachusetts. She then studied at Johns
Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies in
Washington, and in 1968 earned both an M.A. and a certificate in
Russian studies from the Department of Public Law and Government at
Columbia University in New York.
</P>
<P>
   She received her Ph.D. in 1976, also from Columbia's Department

Strategic and International Studies, and in 1981-82 she was a
fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars at
the Smithsonian Institution, Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, Henry Kissinger was referred to on occasion as
``Dr. Kissinger,'' so ``Dr. Albright'' isn't a first.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there any chance that the failed Mars Polar Lander had the
same miscalculation from metric to standard as the failed Mars
Climate Observer that burned up several months ago?
</P>
<P>
   A: There's ``no way'' that the cause of the Polar Lander's
failure was the same, said Mary Hardin of NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. NASA teams ``double checked and
triple checked'' to make sure there were no problems with
conversions, she told Q&AMP;A, ``so we're confident that that was not
the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   However, she said JPL scientists didn't know what the problem
was with the Lander, because the scientists purposely turned off
the JPL transmitters to avoid interfering with the computer
programs that were running at the time the Lander was doing its
``complicated process'' of entry, descent and landing on Mars.
</P>
<P>
   The Lander was supposed to have attempted to reach the surface
of Mars Dec. 3, but NASA lost contact with it, despite several
attempts. The JPL said Dec. 7 that mission controllers would
continue to try to communicate with the Lander for another two
weeks or so, but expectations for success were remote.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read that a trust fund has been set up for Travis Butler,
the 9-year-old who kept his mother's death a secret for a month for
fear he would be sent to a foster home. How can we contribute?
</P>
<P>
   A: Send donations to: National Bank of Commerce, 1 Commerce
Square, Memphis TN 38150. Make checks out to the Travis Butler
Fund, and designate on the check that it is for this account
number: 4770251.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A brief item reported that an anonymous buyer purchased a
Paul Cezanne painting for $30 million that had been stolen from a
Massachusetts home in 1978. Why wasn't it given back to the people
from whom it was taken, rather than being sold at auction?
</P>
<P>
   A: The painting, which was reported stolen 21 years ago from Dr.
Harry Bakwin, a New York child psychologist who was a major Cezanne
collector, in fact had been returned to members of the Bakwin
family. But few details of the theft and recovery are known.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times reported that the painting, ``Pewter Pitcher
and Fruit,'' was recovered recently after Lloyd's, the London
insurance exchange, approached the Art Loss Register, an
international database for stolen and missing art and antiques.
Julian Radcliffe, chairman of the Art Loss Register, said Lloyd's
had received a vague inquiry from someone seeking information
related to the painting, but he didn't know who made the inquiry or
who stole the painting. Nobody is saying how the painting was
recovered, but it ended up with members of the Bakwin family, who
decided to sell it.
</P>
<P>
   Radcliffe said that the police and/or the FBI couldn't make an
arrest in the theft, even if they knew who did it, because the
seven-year statute of limitations for such thefts had expired.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where did the term ``spam'' come from when referring to junk
e-mail? Is it a takeoff on the meat product?
</P>
<P>
   A: The term comes from the Monty Python sketch in which a
couple's attempt to order breakfast leads to the waitress reeling
off a lengthy list of entrees: ``Spam, Spam, Spam, Spam and Spam.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will you print the poem read by Sen. Edward Kennedy at the
memorial service for the Massachusetts firemen who lost their
lives?
</P>
<P>
   A: The poem is titled ``May They Not Be Forgotten'':
</P>
<P>
   Brother when you weep for me,/ Remember that it was meant to
be./ Lay me down and when you leave,/ Remember I'll be at your
sleeve./ In every dark and choking hall,/ I'll be there as you
slowly crawl./
</P>
<P>
   On every roof in driving snow,/ I'll hold your coat and you will
know./ In cellars hot with searing heat,/ At windows where a gate
you meet,/ In closets where young children hide,/ You know I'll be
there at your side./
</P>
<P>
   The house from which I now respond/ Is overstaffed with heroes
gone./ Men who answered one last bell/ Did the job and did it
well./ As firemen, we understand/ That death's a card dealt in our
hand _ / A card we hope we never play,/ But one we hold there
anyway./ That card is something we ignore,/ As we crawl across a
weakened floor./ For we know that we're the only prayer/ For anyone
that might be there./
</P>
<P>
   So remember, as you wipe away your tears,/ The joy I knew
throughout the years./ As I did the job I loved to do,/ I pray that
thought will see you through.''

 &HT;    Ask a dietitian
 &HT;    By Karen Collins, M.S.
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Is corn considered a vegetable or a grain?
</P>
<P>
   A: Botanically and nutritionally speaking, corn is a grain. Corn
is more concentrated in starch (carbohydrate) and calories than
true vegetables such as broccoli, cucumbers and green beans.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes people who have trouble controlling their weight or
blood sugar have been building too much of their meals around
starchy foods _ potatoes and rolls or bread and starchy vegetables
_ without including abundant servings of green, red and orange
vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Corn is a good source of dietary fiber since it retains all
three of its primary layers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are canned fruits and vegetables less nutritious than fresh?
</P>
<P>
   A: Canned fruits and veggies might not look as appealing as
their fresh counterparts, but when it comes to nutrition, don't
count them out.
</P>
<P>
   Fruits and vegetables destined for the cannery are picked at
full ripeness and processed within hours. This gives them a
nutritional head start over produce for green-grocer shelves, which
is generally picked several days earlier to withstand the stress
and time of transport. Once canned, the nutritional content remains
stable for up to two years. In contrast, fresh produce continues to
lose sensitive nutrients until consumed.
</P>
<P>
   Canning and cooking also yield some advantages. Heat breaks down
cell structures, increasing the amount of beta-carotene and
lycopene, a cancer-fighting antioxidant found in tomatoes. It also
kills bacteria, and the vacuum created during canning keeps the
contents safe until opened. Easy-to-store and ready-to-use, canned
foods offer convenience and can significantly cut meal preparation
time.
</P>
<P>
   On the downside, canning, like cooking, causes the loss of some
heat-sensitive and water-soluble nutrients, although most can be
reclaimed by using the canning liquid. Canned foods tend to be
higher in salt and sugars, which makes it advisable to look for
low-sodium and juice-packed versions.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is process cheese?
</P>
<P>
   A: Process cheese is made by combining one or more natural
cheeses with an added emulsifier. The result is a cheese that melts
evenly, slices easily and has a more stable keeping quality.
Process cheese also develops an extremely smooth texture. Like
natural cheese, process cheese may be fat-free, reduced-fat, or of
standard fat content (8 to 9 grams of fat per ounce). The protein
and mineral content-- of natural and process cheese are generally
similar, but the ingredients added to process cheese generally
about double sodium content.
</P>
<P>
   Ask a Dietitian questions were answered by Karen Collins, M.S.,
R.D. of the American Institute for Cancer Research and Dr. Janice
Stuff, a registered dietitian with the USDA/ARS Children's
Nutrition Research Center at Baylor College of Medicine.

   FASHION-MILLER _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The name ``Nolan
Miller'' isn't as well-known as, say, Calvin Klein or Tommy
Hilfiger. But, guaranteed, Americans are familiar with the Miller
look whether they know it or not. Nolan Miller is the man who
dressed Mary Ann in gingham for ``Gilligan's Island.'' He put Peggy
Lipton in hip huggers for ``The Mod Squad.'' And he created those
linebacker-wide shoulder pads for Krystle Carrington on
``Dynasty.'' (Sturrock, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   MARIBEL-ALVAREZ _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Maribel Alvarez
recently bet on a Dolphins game. ``If they won, my friend said
she'd pay for me and another friend to spend a week at Doral
Saturnia,'' she says, referring to the swank Miami spa where
robe-clad socialites agonize over whether to schedule a Swedish
massage or shiatsu. ``If they lost, I'd do some work for her for
free.'' Well, Maribel's going to Miami. And her pal's going to be

 &HT;    To dad, Andy Kaufman was tender son
 &HT;    By Charles Passy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ There is the Andy Kaufman the world
remembers. The irreverent, lost-in-the-clouds comic who entertained
crowds with his impressions of a bumbling foreigner and
hip-swiveling Elvis. And who challenged them with his act as a
brutish wrestler and foul-mouthed lounge lizard.
</P>
<P>
   And there is the Andy Kaufman that Stanley Kaufman, the late
comedian's father, remembers. The nice Jewish boy-turned-man who
never stopped calling his parents Mommy and Daddy. The son who
insisted on having his brother and sister join him atop a Macy's
Thanksgiving Day parade float. The son who helped turn every family
gathering into a virtual variety show.
</P>
<P>
   It's the former Andy Kaufman who will be on display on screens
around the country in ``Man on the Moon.''
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't stop Stanley Kaufman, a Palm Beach Gardens
resident for the past decade, from remembering what he calls the
real Andy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what the commercial aspects require,'' says the
77-year-old retiree, speaking from the patio of his home
overlooking a golf course. ``But I also know that it's not the
story of my son's life. It's a portion, and it's an exaggerated
portion.''
</P>
<P>
   If not a rags-to-riches tale, the full story is certainly an
emotional epic, beginning with Andy's days in the family's Long
Island home, where the young boy used to turn his bedroom into a
make-believe TV studio. Then, he went on to become an entertainer
at children's birthday parties and, after high school, a budding
stand-up comedian on New York's club circuit.
</P>
<P>
   The early years of ``Saturday Night Live'' made Kaufman a comic
force, offering him exposure for his Elvis, Mighty Mouse and
conga-drumming bits. The sitcom ``Taxi,'' in which he played a
clueless, foreign-born mechanic, made him a household name.
</P>
<P>
   But almost by his own maniacal design, his career started to
decline, partly because Kaufman insisted on pursuing a form of
comedy-as-performance art that required audience alienation to
succeed. And then, despite a relatively healthy lifestyle, he was
stricken with a rare lung cancer and died in 1984 at the age of 35.
</P>
<P>
   As for Stanley, there was a chapter after Andy. Following a long
career in the costume jewelry business, he moved from New York to
South Florida for the good life. And despite weathering a trio of
tragedies _ the deaths of Andy and Stanley's first and second wives
_ he appears to be enjoying it. His spacious home in a gated
community reflects his love of travel and art: Works by
photographer Irving Penn and pop-art painter Keith Haring grace the
walls.
</P>
<P>
   When he's not taking in his view of the golf course, he's out on
it, joining a group of friends for a regular game.
</P>
<P>
   But there's been little time for such pleasures in recent weeks.
He has attended events and screenings in New York and is doing the
same in Hollywood. He's been interviewed on MSNBC and ABC's ``Good
Morning America.'' Naturally, it's all because of the movie and two
new Kaufman biographies: Bill Zehme's authorized account, ``Lost in
the Funhouse'' (Delacorte Press) and former Kaufman sidekick Bob
Zmuda's more tabloid-inspired version, ``Andy Kaufman Revealed!''
(Little, Brown and Company). Zmuda is also co-executive producer of
the Milos Forman film.
</P>
<P>
   The projects have clearly elevated Kaufman's reputation. Some
critics even suggest that he faked his death as the con to end all
cons. Could it be true?
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course not,'' says Stanley. His sudden quietness catches a
visitor off guard. It's a poignant reminder that, amidst all the
hoopla, the recent events resonate on a different level for him:
This is a story, after all, of a father losing a son.
</P>
<P>
   And that father shaped the son, mostly for the better. Author
Zehme believes that, if it weren't for Stanley, Kaufman could have
easily foundered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Stanley rode him hard enough to keep him alive,'' he
says, noting Andy's teenage days of abusing drugs and skipping
school. He adds that Stanley took a keen interest in his son's
talent, even if he didn't always understand it. He begins the
second chapter of his biography with an account of Stanley and a
5-year-old Andy in an amusement-park recording booth, the father
asking the boy, ``How 'bout a little song for us?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That is so lovely,'' Zehme says. ``To see a father encourage
this performing spirit in his son at such a young age.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanley's daughter, Carol Kaufman Kerman, now married and
raising three children in the Chicago area, says her father gave
Andy the gift of freedom. Whereas most parents in the family's
predominantly Jewish community wanted their children to become
doctors and lawyers, Stanley didn't follow the herd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my father had wider boundaries than other fathers in
Great Neck,'' she says. ``He had pride in having an old tattered
couch in his living room when everybody else was getting new stuff.
He felt more real to me. And I think he gave that kind of grounding
to Andy. He certainly gave him a lot of relentless love.''
</P>
<P>
   By Stanley's admission, he was far from the perfect dad. A
thrice-decorated World War II veteran, he was given to frequent
fits of rage, especially during the post-war years when he ran his
father's struggling jewelry company. (It was eventually sold, and
Stanley started his own firm.)
</P>
<P>
   And he found plenty to yell at when it came to Kaufman, be it
his oldest child's poor grades or unkempt hair _ to say nothing of
the fact that the boy kept himself cloistered in his room for
hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was not the easiest kid in the world,'' Stanley recalls.
``He was very, very curious. He wouldn't accept the things that
were handed to him. He always questioned.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Stanley encouraged Andy, escorting him to
children's birthday parties where the teenage entertainer first
began practicing his juvenile-inspired comedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ended up with a hernia from carrying the sound projector,''
he says, joking affectionately. And he credits Andy's mother,
Janice, with being even more supportive: She's the one who kept the
house quiet and stable, particularly in the rough-and-tumble years
when Andy was heading into New York comedy clubs late at night,
looking for a break. ``He was really loved,'' says Stanley, ``and
he loved in return.''
</P>
<P>
   The father also made peace with Andy when their relationship was
fractured. Noting how his beatnik-loving son never left the house
without a copy of Jack Kerouac's ``On the Road,'' he decided to
read the novel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved it,'' he says without hesitation. Andy caught him one
day crying over a particular passage. ``Together we read, and
together we cried, and the whole thing was reconciled,'' Stanley
remembers. ``And after that, I never saw how long his hair was.''
</P>
<P>
   But did he see his comedic talent? Stanley is not without a
playful side: Ask him to pose for a photo, and he'll suggest swim
trunks for a poolside spread. And his quirky sense of humor often
helped his business: He once interrupted a tense meeting with a
group of bankers, saying it was time for jumping jacks, a stunt
that could have come straight from the mind of Andy.
</P>
<P>
   But Stanley admits he favors Andy's more traditional work,
particularly his five-year run as the helpless Latka on ``Taxi.''
Ironically, that's the comedy Andy cared for the least.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hated doing other people's material,'' Stanley says. But
the father, who managed his son's finances during his life and
oversees much of his estate today, knew that ``Taxi'' would provide
Andy with security and freedom. ``It made him an international
figure.''
</P>
<P>
   What Andy chose to do with such success shocked his fans _ and
his family. Remembering his love for the great wrestlers of
yesteryear, he created his own wrestling show _ but with a twist:
He challenged only women.
</P>
<P>
   Then he took one of his many alter egos, the loathsome nightclub
singer Tony Clifton, and appeared as the singer on stage and talk
shows, all the while insisting that he and Clifton were separate
people. It had the odd effect of turning Andy from an innocent,
not-quite-of-this-planet entertainer _ a ``man on the moon,'' if
you will _ into a pig of a showman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hated the wrestling. We didn't like Tony Clifton,'' says
Stanley, who blames Bob Zmuda _ Andy's ``so-called best friend'' _
for guiding his career in this direction. ``We sensed it was not
helping. People didn't like the character he was portraying . . .
It wasn't Andy.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's precisely the point, argues Zmuda. Andy saw the dark
side of comedy and relished the opportunity to wear as many masks
as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's exactly what Andy does, he blurs the line between
fantasy and reality,'' Zmuda explains, speaking as if Andy were
still alive. By taking it to the highest degree _ by creating an
act that would make him universally hated _ Zmuda feels Andy proved
himself the ultimate performer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Andy never wrestled or never did Clifton, nobody would
care. It's because Andy went over the line and got into these
dangerous areas,'' he says. ``His legacy is not Latka, and I know
that's hard for Stanley to swallow.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference of opinion might have remained just that were it
not for the movie, whose title comes from an REM song celebrating
Andy. Suddenly, Stanley finds himself engaged in a daily battle
with Zmuda, fighting to restore what he believes is his son's true
reputation. He's particularly angered that the film makes almost no
reference to Andy's family, even though they were brought in as
consultants and spent several days working with the screenwriters
and Carrey.
</P>
<P>
   ``His character, his personality as a human being were never
presented in the movie, and I'm not happy about that,'' Stanley
says, although he credits Carrey with an Oscar-worthy, finely
detailed performance. ``When I first saw him (on the set), I just
broke down. This was Andy.''
</P>
<P>
   The battle between Stanley and Zmuda has gone beyond the media.
In an event many believed was staged, Zmuda, disguised as Clifton,
interrupted a ``Man on the Moon'' press conference two weeks ago,
wrestling with Carrey and pretending to urinate.
</P>
<P>
   But staged or not, Stanley has had enough: The family is legally
forbidding Zmuda from making any more appearances as Clifton,
unless they're sanctioned by Universal Pictures, the studio behind
``Man on the Moon.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Zmuda has supporters of his wild-man view of Andy _
and many believe the press-conference flap was the kind of
shenanigans Andy would have scripted if he were alive. When it
comes to the darker Andy, says former girlfriend Lynne Margulies,
``I think Stanley just doesn't get why it's funny. And he's also
looking out for his son. He wants his son to be loved.''
</P>
<P>
   Margulies, a television director who's now making a documentary
about Andy for the A&AMP;E network, adds that she sees more than a
little of Stanley in Clifton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stanley really yelled a lot,'' she says, noting that, while
Andy's love for his dad ran deep, the shouting also drove him
inward. If anything, she believes Andy's childlike fantasy world _
the basis of his peculiar brand of comedy _ emerged as an escape
from a turbulent household.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even Margulies (played in the movie by Courtney Love)
says it's hard not to be charmed by Stanley, calling him ``a real
ladies' man'' and crediting him with making significant strides
toward understanding Andy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great for him to be reflective,'' she says,
adding that Andy ``wasn't holding a grudge as far as I can tell.''
</P>
<P>
   And don't think Stanley is incapable of comprehending all of
Andy's comedy. ``I've occasionally gotten calls from Tony Clifton's
father,'' Zehme says.
</P>
<P>
   Zehme also calls Stanley ``the pillar of strength'' when it came
time for the family to face the loss of Andy. Ever the respectful
son, Andy kept his illness a secret from his parents because he
didn't want to trouble his mother, who had suffered a stroke around
the same time.
</P>
<P>
   By the time word got to Stanley, Andy was barely able to move.
In his book, Zehme describes how the grief-stricken father lifted
his son onto a hospital table for a final radiation treatment.
</P>
<P>
   But life continued for Stanley following Andy. And even the
death two years ago of his second wife, Mildred, hasn't slowed him
down. His house may seem a little too big for a 77-year-old
bachelor, but he fills it with his pistol-like personality _ and
with plenty of memorabilia from Andy's career. (His favorite of all
the photos? A picture of a grown-up Andy indulging in a dish of ice
cream, his favorite treat.)
</P>
<P>
   After the film opens, Stanley suspects life will return to
normal. He'll get back to his golf game. He'll drive up
occasionally to the apartment he keeps in New York. He'll tool
around his gated community in his '75 Buick, a car he keeps just to
get a rise out of his neighbors. And he'll visit his five
grandchildren _ three by daughter Carol, one by son Michael and one
by, yes, Andy.
</P>
<P>
   The latter was the biggest surprise of all. When Andy was barely
out of high school, a romance with a neighborhood girl led to an
unplanned pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley says Andy offered to marry the girl, but she chose
instead to give up the daughter for adoption. Jump ahead a couple
of decades and that child, named Maria, finds her way to Stanley,
who instantly embraces her as a member of the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love her dearly. . . . She has brought Andy back into my
life as a living thing,'' he says. The two talk on the phone
several times a week. And Maria has a daughter, making Stanley a
great-grandfather of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not how Stanley views it. Instead, the proud father's
thoughts return to his late son, who would have turned 50 this
year. To him, Andy is not a man on the moon. ``Andy is a
grandfather.''

 &HT;    Wrapping up tradition
 &HT;    By Ricardo Gandara
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ So Grandpa Pete is telling the story about four
legs sticking out of the ground and how he was going to make them
fit in the grave.
</P>
<P>
   The family's Shetland pony died one summer day. Because of the
heat, Pete Sanchez and his wife and daughter were forced to bury
it. They dug a shallow grave and pulled the heavy animal to its
resting place _ only the pony landed on its back, its legs straight
up in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Grandpa had an idea: Get the chainsaw.
</P>
<P>
   No.
</P>
<P>
   Yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made the sign of the cross and asked God to forgive me,'' he
recalls, pantomiming pulling the rope to start the
</P>
<P>
   saw.
</P>
<P>
   The room full of people couldn't laugh any harder. Never mind
that they hear the same story every year.
</P>
<P>
   This is the Sanchez family tamalada, where as many as 40 members
gather a week before Christmas to make tamales _ corn masa, or
dough, and pork chili meat wrapped lovingly inside corn husks _ and
memories.
</P>
<P>
   It is a communal ritual at the home of Mary and Pete Sanchez
(Grandma and Grandpa from here on) to make a load of tamales _ 76
dozen this year _ to last throughout the holidays. It simply is not
Christmas without tamales. And all that goes with them: jokes and
constant ribbing, chisme (gossip) and so much love it could engulf
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Grandma and Grandpa, 74 and 73 and married nearly 54 years, have
been hosting the tamalada more than 35 years. Its roots go back to
1934, however, when Mary Sanchez learned the art as a child from
her parents, who lived in Del Valle at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``En esos dias (In those days),'' said Grandma, ``we steamed the
tamales outside on Christmas Eve. Teniamos nacimiento y rosario
</P>
<P>
   (We had a Nativity scene and prayed the rosary). Y luego
comiamos tamales (Then we ate tamales).''
</P>
<P>
   They stayed up until 3 a.m. playing. The adults visited. She
played with her cousins while the boys lit firecrackers and tried
to prove they were men by letting them explode in their clenched
fists.
</P>
<P>
   The family tamalada is a little tamer now, but no less fun and
loud.
</P>
<P>
   Hopie Perez, the bingo player of the family and Grandma and
Grandpa's niece, kept everyone laughing with her PG-rated jokes.
``Hay fregado (loosely, 'I better watch it!'),'' she said when she
learned of a reporter in the room.
</P>
<P>
   David Varela, the gentlemanly high-school history teacher who is
married to Teresa, Grandma and Grandpa's oldest, was harassed the
most, especially about his thinning hair. ``I'm giving you Rogaine
for Christmas,'' said Robert Sanchez, who is married to Grandma and
Grandpa's granddaughter Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's OK,'' Varela said. ``I'm the best spreader.''
</P>
<P>
   Spreading the masa on the corn husk is the hardest part of
making tamales. At this tamalada, however, everyone claimed to be
an expert. Someone brought $6 plastic spreaders, but they were
chastised by the ``spooners,'' those who spread masa the
old-fashioned way with a spoon. Despite the abundance of master
spreaders, few passed Grandma's inspection.
</P>
<P>
   She ran the show. Grandma had everything set up when daughters
Teresa, Mary Capuchino and Isabel Velasquez were the first to
arrive before 9 a.m. Two hogs' heads and several pork butt roasts
were cooked, and the husks soaked overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Daughter Mary is always in charge of making the masa, and she
did it with one eye on Grandma. ``Poquito mas chile y sal (Needs a
little more chile and salt),'' said Grandma, tasting a pinch.
</P>
<P>
   ``You learn not to question what she says. She just knows,''
said the daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's quality control,'' said David Varela.
</P>
<P>
   Grandma was not shy about tweaking here and there. She'd warn
them they were putting too little masa or too much. Or, they were
making them too long. ``They're longnecks, Grandma,'' someone said.
</P>
<P>
   Another round of laughter, and they'd burst into a verse of ``We
Wish You a Merry Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   Grandma smiled. ``Me da mucho gusto (It gives me great joy),''
she said, putting her hand to her heart, ``-- ara tener a todos
aqui (to have everyone here).''
</P>
<P>
   The assembling of the tamales worked like a finely tuned
basketball team. Everyone had a job. Teresa and Isabel stayed in
the kitchen to wash dishes and fix lunch. Most people spread the
masa on husks while grandson Marcos Varela and great-granddaughter
Jackie Sanchez added the meat filling.
</P>
<P>
   They started assembling the tamales at 10:30 a.m. and by 12:45
p.m., 76 dozen were wrapped. Thirteen dozen were cooked _ a reward
lunch _ and the rest were frozen. They're to be cooked on Christmas
Eve and Christmas Day at various family gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are so good,'' said Grandpa Pete, fudging that he had
only eaten two. To complete his all-cholesterol plate, he also had
chicharrones, or pork rinds.
</P>
<P>
   And Heinz ketchup on the tamales? He's had them that way as long
as he can remember. No one has a good explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is something I cannot understand,'' said David Varela.
``Ruining the taste of tamales like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Just then someone called out, ``Hey, pass the ketchup.''
</P>
<P>
   Go figure.
</P>
<P>
   What is easy to understand is the closeness of the family. The
clan gets together most major holidays. They greet each other with
hugs. The children always kiss their grandparents. The young people
respect the elders.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we stick together,'' said Jesse Sanchez, Grandma and
Grandpa's youngest, who has given them eight grandchildren. ``This
tamalada helps keep everyone united, and it's a good way to show
the kids what's important.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanging onto the tradition is good, but it's even better sitting
around, being together and belonging to a family. The Sanchezes
have this down pat.

 &HT;    Make-ahead items allow cooks to enjoy Christmas
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ On Christmas Day, the cook responsible for the
holiday dinner is also likely to be the one picking up wrapping
paper and consulting on the assembly of toys. There's no time, it
seems, to fix brunch. People tend to pick up store-bought coffee
cakes and eat them on the run.
</P>
<P>
   But an easy holiday brunch can be a relaxing break in a busy
Christmas Day. The definition of easy is dishes that can be mostly
made ahead, and that's the key to this brunch menu.
</P>
<P>
   The star of the menu is a buttermilk pecan coffee cake that can
be assembled in the pan and refrigerated overnight. In the morning,
just slip it in the oven to bake for half an hour. This makes it
easy to serve warm coffee cake _ and this one is luscious when
still warm. As the batter rises, the cinnamon, sugar and butter
topping forms pools in the cake. And while the cake bakes, the
spicy aroma will lure family to the table.
</P>
<P>
   The menu includes another easy dish _ baked eggs. Decades ago
they were called shirred eggs, but they have been forgotten in a
world that has moved on to egg dishes such as Italian frittata.
</P>
<P>
   While these eggs can't be made ahead, they are so simple that a
novice who might be terrified of making an omelette or even
scrambled eggs can handle them.
</P>
<P>
   What you need to do in advance is buy some ramekins _ small
ovenproof dishes. They're available at most cookware stores. Look
for the size big enough to hold six ounces, or two eggs.
</P>
<P>
   The eggs are poured into the ramekins and baked. A bit of cream
poured on top and a little sprinkled cheese add a finishing touch.
</P>
<P>
   We liked the bright green color of creamed spinach as the base
for the eggs. The creamed spinach can be made the night before.
Another variation is to use cubes of ham and swiss cheese as the
base, or just a slice of ham. Other possibilities are a layer of
ratatouille or sauteed mushrooms, all of which can be made ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Grapefruit is a fruit of the winter season, and the Ruby Red
variety is perfect for a Christmas brunch. An old-fashioned
specialty is broiled grapefruit sprinkled with spiced sugar. A
recipe adding ginger to the sugar topping rounds out this brunch.
</P>
<P>
   RECIPES
</P>
<P>
   This easy cake is light and tender, and best when served warm
from the oven. For added eye appeal, scatter a few pecan halves on
top before baking.
</P>
<P>
   OVERNIGHT BUTTERMILK PECAN COFFEE CAKE
</P>
<P>
   Makes 12 to 15 servings
</P>
<P>
   Cake:
</P>
<P>
   10 tablespoons butter, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup light brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 large eggs
</P>
<P>
   2 cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon baking soda
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 cup buttermilk
</P>
<P>
   Topping:
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup light brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup coarsely chopped pecans
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons butter, melted
</P>
<P>
   Place the butter and sugars in the large bowl of an electric
mixer and beat until well combined, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the eggs
and beat just until the eggs are incorporated. Combine the flour,
cinnamon, baking powder, soda and salt. Add to batter alternately
with the buttermilk. Beat a minute or two at medium low speed so
that the batter is smooth.
</P>
<P>
   Lightly oil and flour a 13-by-9-inch baking pan. Shake out any
excess flour.
</P>
<P>
   Pour the batter into the prepared pan.
</P>
<P>
   In a small bowl, combine the light brown sugar, pecans and
cinnamon. Scatter this topping evenly over the batter. Dribble the
topping with melted butter. Cover the pan with plastic wrap and
refrigerate overnight.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, place a rack in the center of the oven and
preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Remove the pan from the
refrigerator and remove the plastic wrap. If the pan is glass, let
it sit at room temperature until the chill is off before putting it
into the oven. Bake the coffee cake for 30 to 32 minutes, until the
cake springs back in the center when lightly pressed with your
finger and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
Remove the pan to a wire rack to cool 15 minutes. Cut into squares
and serve warm.
</P>
<P>
   (Recipe is from the Georgia Pecan Commission.)
</P>
<P>
   Approximate nutritional analysis per serving: 351 calories, 17.7
g fat, 68 mg cholesterol, 261 mg sodium.
</P>
<P>
   Eggs are usually gently baked in a water bath, a tedious
process. We take a shortcut here and spoon a little cream over the
yolks to protect them while they bake.
</P>
<P>
   This recipe for creamed spinach departs from the traditional,
which usually calls for as much as a cup and a half of cream. This
one calls for just 1/3 cup cream, but the result is creamy and
silken.
</P>
<P>
   CREAMED SPINACH
</P>
<P>
   Makes enough for six ramekins
</P>
<P>
   3 10-ounce bags washed spinach
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons salt (for blanching spinach)
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Pull off spinach stems and discard.
</P>
<P>
   Bring 4 quarts water to a boil with the salt and add the
spinach, pushing it down into the water with a long wooden spoon.
Boil until the spinach just ``melts,'' about 30 seconds. Drain
immediately in a colander and rinse under cold running water until
the spinach no longer feels warm to the touch.
</P>
<P>
   Squeeze the water out of the spinach. Cut coarsely. Refrigerate,
covered, until ready to use.
</P>
<P>
   Season the cream generously with salt and pepper and boil it in
a medium pot or saute pan over high heat for 3 or 4 minutes, until
it gets very thick. Add the spinach and turn the heat down to
medium. Stir for a minute or two until spinach is warm and has
absorbed all the cream.
</P>
<P>
   (Recipe from James's Peterson's Vegetables (Morrow, $35).
</P>
<P>
   Approximate nutritional analysis per serving:78 calories, 5 g
fat, 18 mg cholesterol, 107 mg sodium, plus sodium in salt used for
blanching.
</P>
<P>
   TIP: If you want to gussy up this old fashioned recipe you can
grind crystallized ginger and substitute it for the ground ginger.
Or try using brown sugar instead of regular sugar. If you have
fresh mint_ and mine is still growing in my garden _ garnish the
grapefruit with a sprig or two.
</P>
<P>
   BROILED GRAPEFRUIT WITH GINGER SUGAR
</P>
<P>
   Makes 6 servings
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 teaspoons ground ginger
</P>
<P>
   3 large Ruby Red grapefruit
</P>
<P>
   Combine the sugar and ginger. This can be done ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Halve grapefruit crosswise and run a knife around each section
to loosen the membranes. Preheat broiler.
</P>
<P>
   Arrange grapefruit, cut side up, in a baking pan just large
enough to hold them in one layer. Sprinkle evenly with sugar
mixture to cover. Broil grapefruits about three inches from the
heat until the sugar melts and tops begin to brown, about 4 to 6
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Approximate nutritional analysis per serving:127 calories, 0
fat, 0 cholesterol, 0 sodium.

   FASHION-MILLER _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The name ``Nolan
Miller'' isn't as well-known as, say, Calvin Klein or Tommy
Hilfiger. But, guaranteed, Americans are familiar with the Miller
look whether they know it or not. Nolan Miller is the man who
dressed Mary Ann in gingham for ``Gilligan's Island.'' He put Peggy

Saturnia,'' she says, referring to the swank Miami spa where
robe-clad socialites agonize over whether to schedule a Swedish
massage or shiatsu. ``If they lost, I'd do some work for her for
free.'' Well, Maribel's going to Miami. And her pal's going to be

   KAUFMAN-SON _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ There is the Andy Kaufman
the world remembers. The irreverent, lost-in-the-clouds comic who
entertained crowds with his impressions of a bumbling foreigner and
hip-swiveling Elvis. And who challenged them with his act as a
brutish wrestler and foul-mouthed lounge lizard. And there is the
Andy Kaufman that Stanley Kaufman, the late comedian's father,
remembers. The nice Jewish boy-turned-man who never stopped calling
his parents Mommy and Daddy. The son who insisted on having his
brother and sister join him atop a Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade
float. The son who helped turn every family gathering into a
virtual variety show. It's the former Andy Kaufman who will be on
display on screens around the country in ``Man on the Moon.'' But
that doesn't stop the senior Kaufman from remembering what he calls
the real Andy. (Passy, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   WASHINGTON, Dec. 20 - It is adorned with animated solar panels,
huge, rotating pods that house a laboratory, a museum, a docking
site for transportation vehicles, and moves along a paved street at
2.5 miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   But Boeing's 45,000-pound space station, made up of mostly steel
beams and floral decoration, won't ever leave the ground; the
ship's 5.5-mile mission is to roll down Colorado blvd. in Pasadena,
Calif., at the head of the 111th Tournament of Roses parade. The
parade, carrying the theme ``Celebrations 2000: Visions of the
Future,'' precedes the Rose Bowl football match New Year's Day
between the Stanford University Cardinal and the University of
Wisconsin-Madison Badgers.
</P>
<P>
   The carnival-like parade will be, as usual, filled with flowers,
music, fireworks and football. But this time the tournament's
organizers looked to space travel to capture the imagination of the
estimated 425 million people around the world who will watch the
event on television, and rev them up for the match.
</P>
<P>
   Among floats featuring aliens and time machines, Boeing's
massive space community was a cut above the 54 other floats in the
parade.
</P>
<P>
   ``[The Boeing float] really is a vision of the future, and I
felt it best depicted our theme,'' Tournament of Roses president
Ken Burrows told States News Service and Space.com. ``When it goes
up in its full, upright position, it's just awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing contracted Phoenix Decorating Co. in Pasadena to create a
space community both realistic and fantastic, blaring the
soundtrack to ``2001: A Space Odyssey.'' Eight hundred and fifty
Boeing employees from across the country have volunteered to
decorate it.
</P>
<P>
   Because Rose Bowl parade rules forbid using a commercial product
in the parade, the float's designers had to steer clear of space
vehicle projects already in the works and stick to fantasy. Much of
the work in recent weeks has been decorating the float with lavish
ornaments.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Harvey, who works on business development in Boeing's
graphics department, volunteered a Saturday recently to cut and
paste dried flowers on the ship's solar panels. ``I think it's
exciting,'' Harvey said. ``To be the first float we are pretty
honored.''
</P>
<P>
   The enormous animated solar panels are adorned with silver leaf,
Japanese seaweed, and cottonseeds. Below the ship is a swirling
universe, populated by planets, moons and asteroids, decorated with
red strawflowers, orange lentil, green split pea and spices. The
base of the vehicle is covered with orchids, lilies, daisies, iris
and - of course - roses.
</P>
<P>
   While it won't enter the cosmos, navigating the float down the
street requires the highest level of float technology. Thanks to
hydraulic pumps operated by two massive Chevrolet engines, the
craft can expand and contract its height to avoid hitting trees,
bridges and phone wires. The float is 17 feet high when contracted,
45 feet high when expanded, 55 feet long, and 18 feet wide in the
thinnest area, and 25 feet at the widest parts. A lone, hidden
operator will sit in the nose, controlling all the operations -
including the stereo system, but not the driving.
</P>
<P>
   Before the parade, a panel of judges will give the floats awards
for various categories, such as 'most beautiful'.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've captured so much on it,'' said Carol Draper, a data
tracker for Boeing who also worked on the float. ``I wouldn't be
surprised if it won [an award].''

<P>
   Jan Bruckner, a professor of physical therapy at Thomas
Jefferson University in Philadelphia, heads across campus for a 10
a.m. appointment at the Human Performance Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   There, Gary Sylvester, one of Bruckner's students, nervously
waits. He has responded to her standing offer to examine any pupil
who complains of foot pain.
</P>
<P>
   Bruckner begins the evaluation by asking his age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-three,'' he announces.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of 23?'' says an older woman being treated for a serious
foot problem in the same lab. She listens jealously as Sylvester
explains that he runs 15 miles a week. His feet rub inside his
shoes, get raw around the toes and develop blisters.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvester is far from alone. After years of clinical practice,
anthropological research and pioneering studies, Bruckner has
concluded that, biomechanically speaking, there's no such thing as
a normal human foot.
</P>
<P>
   Instead there is a spectrum of variations. Biologically, the
foot remains a work in progress, and it needs a lot more help from
the shoe industry than it's getting.
</P>
<P>
   If Sylvester hadn't bothered to show up today, his blisters
could have easily led to heel spurs and then to instability in his
ankles and knees. Eventually his minor complaint would have turned
into chronic pain. But because he is still young, a simple,
custom-made shoe insert designed by Bruckner will save his feet.
</P>
<P>
   Bruckner is a quiet, polite revolutionary driven to save the
world's feet. She has worked in relative obscurity, refining her
theories of the lowest human appendage for 15 years without major
grants or corporate backing. Her work has become a crusade.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, after eight years of practicing physical therapy,
Bruckner wanted more information about the foot's biomechanics. To
that end, she enrolled in the physical anthropology program at
Indiana University.
</P>
<P>
   She began reading old anthropology studies about bones and
joints, work considered irrelevant in the medical community.
</P>
<P>
   ``I discovered something that they'd never taught me when I
studied anatomy in physical therapy,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   A few anthropologists had written about a wide range of shapes
and configurations of the human foot, variations that modern
textbooks never mention. In particular, the shape of the talus bone
_ directly above the heel and below the lower leg bone _ differs
widely among humans.
</P>
<P>
   Visually, these anomalies don't amount to much. Mechanically,
however, Bruckner suspected they might mean a great deal.
</P>
<P>
   The variations that seemed most important to her occur in a
joint called the subtalar, where the rounded talus bone fits into
the knobby calcaneus, or heel bone.
</P>
<P>
   The bones' irregular forms usually touch each other at two or
three distinct points called facets. Bruckner realized that a joint
with three facets would be stable and rigid, like a stool with
three legs, and would restrict motion and allow more shock to shoot
through the foot into neighboring joints.
</P>
<P>
   Two-faceted joints, on the other hand, would allow greater
flexibility. Three facets looked like trouble, but Bruckner wasn't
sure how that variation affected modern humans. It turned out that
nobody else knew either.
</P>
<P>
   To find out, Bruckner needed lots of feet. She began with the
dead. Because she taught in the physical-therapy department at the
university's medical school, she had access to the cadavers used in
anatomy classes. She dissected the feet of more than 30 bodies and
tallied more three-faceted than two-faceted joints.
</P>
<P>
   More disturbing, she found that one-third of the bodies had a
two-faceted joint in one foot but a three-faceted joint in the
other, or vice versa, violating left-right symmetry found elsewhere
in the body. In her small but random sample, Bruckner didn't find a
single normal pair of feet.
</P>
<P>
   She began to wonder what happens to the knees, hips and lower
backs in people who have mismatched shock absorbers in their feet.
</P>
<P>
   To continue her research on the living without using surgery,
she developed a technique for wiggling patients' heels to reveal
three-faceted joints. But she still needed a live group of research
subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Bruckner found them by chance when she filled in as a temporary
physical therapist with the Tohono O'odham (pronounced like autumn)
tribe of southern Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, Bruckner struck a deal with the tribe: She agreed to
work at the reservation's clinic without pay if she could examine
the feet of any willing member of the tribe. Because the O'odham
are a relatively homogeneous population, Bruckner half expected to
find almost no variations in their feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're about as close to genetically isolated as you're going
to find in North America,'' she says. Instead, she found wide
deviation in the subtalar joints.
</P>
<P>
   She still needed a research pool more diverse than the O'odham.
In the winter of 1989, the Persian Gulf War delivered them almost
to her front door.
</P>
<P>
   As troops were shipped to the gulf, Bruckner went to work for
the U.S. Army at Fort Benjamin Harrison in Indiana. She worked for
free, under the proviso that she could examine the healthy feet of
anyone on the base who volunteered for her research.
</P>
<P>
   Again she found plenty of variation _ and something else. If a
soldier had a three-faceted joint in one foot and a two-faceted in
the other, the odds for injury were higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was even more devastating than facet configuration,'' she
says, ``was asymmetry.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruckner finally had enough data to support her theory, but she
didn't stop there. Bruckner approached the captain in charge of the
clinic at Fort Benjamin Harrison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `You have to stop issuing shoes by the pair. Issue
shoes by the each. The soldiers in our clinic with problems have
one foot significantly different from the other.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Lady,'' she remembers his saying, ``this is the Army. We can't
do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruckner didn't give up on her dream of perfect shoes for the
masses. In 1996, she met Dimitris Metaxas, a computer scientist at
the University of Pennsylvania. He invited her to a look at a
trademarked program called Jack, a computer model of a person who
exists only on-screen and was designed to create better
workstations.
</P>
<P>
   Bruckner immediately saw the program's potential to help her
design shoes to fit every foot in the world perfectly. But while
Jack's upper body seemed to accurately replicate a human's, his
feet were another story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack walked like a robot,'' she says. ``Jack had no subtalar
joints. His feet looked like slabs of meat.''
</P>
<P>
   Although jack is now owned by a private company that contracts
the program to corporations, his existence lured Bruckner to
Philadelphia: She needed virtual patients to model virtual shoes,
and the center's programmers could build them.
</P>
<P>
   Two computer models are under development. One is a gait model
that walks according to an individual's variations. Until now,
every gait model worked from an ideal algorithm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody walks like anybody else, much less with an ideal
gait,'' Bruckner says.
</P>
<P>
   The other model represents a person's foot, facilitating
shoe-design for individual needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to put these two programs together and run clinical
studies. I want to use these intelligent programs to fabricate
shoes and make orthotics.''
</P>
<P>
   From the feet of mankind comes a heartfelt thank-you.

 By STEWART MASSAD  
 c.1999 Discover magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   ``I've been dreaming about having a baby,'' Ashley said.
</P>
<P>
   That's not a strange thing for a childless 36-year-old woman to
tell her gynecologist, but it surprised me because this patient is
HIV-infected. Having a baby implies having a future, something that
those of us who have watched women die of AIDS once never dared
hope for.
</P>
<P>
   But Ashley has always been tenacious. Six years ago, the
boyfriend who introduced her to heroin and HIV died of pneumonia,
leaving her resolved to convince others not to duplicate her
mistakes. She began speaking in schools, women's shelters and
halfway houses. Before long she met Ron, another former drug user
who is HIV positive.
</P>
<P>
   Their collaboration in the fight against AIDS inspired a love
bold enough to include the prospect of having a child.
</P>
<P>
   When Ashley came under my care a few years ago, she told me she
had initially fought against AIDS with little hope of victory. But
in 1994, she participated in a landmark study. The results
demonstrated that a combination drug therapy including inhibitors
of the HIV protease enzyme, begun early in the course of infection,
could reduce the virus to undetectable levels in blood samples and
prolong life.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley began to dream of having a child. She read all she could
about her disease and the latest advances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been thinking about this for a long time,'' she finally
said, as we sat together in a conference room, ``but it seemed so
unfair to bear a child I'd never be there for. Now, for the first
time since my diagnosis, I feel like there might be a life for me.
I want your perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   I took a long breath. Until recently, children born with HIV
usually died as infants or toddlers, from diarrhea, pneumonia or
meningitis. Thanks to advances in antiviral therapy, those days are
largely past, and children born with HIV now live into their teens
and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, results from the Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group,
a national consortium of clinicians and patients involved in
experimental studies, showed that when mothers were treated with
the anti-HIV drug zidovudine during late pregnancy and labor, only
8 percent of the babies were born HIV-infected. Among women given
placebos, 26 percent of the babies were born HIV-infected.
</P>
<P>
   By lessening the amount of HIV in the mother's blood, zidovudine
reduced the exposure of the baby to blood-borne virus during
delivery.
</P>
<P>
   More recent studies have deepened our understanding of anti-HIV
drug therapy. When mothers take zidovudine along with protease
inhibitors and other drugs, the risk is much lower than when they
take zidovudine alone. In Ashley's case the infection was
relatively well controlled. At 397, her CD4 count, the number of
infection-fighting T cells, was OK, and the virus in her blood was
too low to show up in tests.
</P>
<P>
   Staying healthy required a complicated drug regimen: pills taken
up to five times each day, some with food, some on an empty
stomach. But Ashley was nothing if not dedicated.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't see her until she returned six months later for her
annual Pap smear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying,'' she told me. ``Some people tell me that it's
selfish, that any risk of handing on this disease is too great. But
to me, having a baby is standing up to the virus. We think it's
time to look ahead, to create life, not just avoid dying.''
</P>
<P>
   We talked about the ethical issues her pregnancy raised. We
talked about how HIV mutates rapidly, and the same viral strain can
evolve differently in different individuals with different immune
systems and genetic makeups.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley accepted that if Ron stopped using condoms it was
theoretically possible that she might get infected with a more
virulent strain of HIV. She understood that in the months or years
to come the virus she carried might become resistant to drugs,
killing her before her baby had a chance to know her. She had made
plans: Her sister had agreed to raise the child if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Within three months, Ashley was pregnant. She faced morning
sickness, which compounded the nausea caused by her anti-HIV drugs.
Twice she had to be admitted to the hospital because she could not
keep any liquids or anti-retroviral medications down.
</P>
<P>
   But with an antiemetic patch behind her ear, she managed to keep
taking her pills, even when she could swallow nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   By the 15th week of pregnancy, Ashley's appetite returned. The
next issue she faced was amniocentesis. For pregnant women of her
age, genetic testing is standard to identify babies with Down
syndrome and other defects. But the needle required to draw cells
from the amniotic fluid can introduce HIV into the fetus.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley decided to forgo the procedure, as HIV-infected mothers
are advised to do, and get a detailed ultrasound instead. Her
knuckles were white as she clutched Ron's hand during the
procedure, but the ultrasound was fine.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley's contractions started early during her third trimester.
Soon after, she quit work to rest in bed. Weekly ultrasound scans
showed the baby growing and kicking, stretching in anticipation of
birth.
</P>
<P>
   How to deliver the baby was the next critical issue. Cesarean
section reduces the risk of HIV transmission to the child because
the baby encounters the mother's virus-infected blood only briefly
during the procedure. Unfortunately, the risks to the mother _
infection, bleeding and anesthetic complications _ are higher for
cesareans than for vaginal deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that matters is protecting my child. I'll take the
knife,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Eight months into the pregnancy, Ashley's contractions picked up
again. Her cervix softened and began to open. We had to perform the
cesarean before the bag of amniotic fluid broke, exposing the baby
to virus in the mother's body.
</P>
<P>
   Like any surgical procedure, cesarean section requires all the
usual precautions: gowns, masks, gloves. But in the age of AIDS, we
have added new barriers. The masks have shields to protect against
splashes of blood. The gowns are impermeable. Everyone on the
operating team wears two sets of gloves, and shoes are covered with
knee-high gaiters.
</P>
<P>
   Still, performing a cesarean section on a woman with HIV is
frightening because the initial focus is not to stop the bleeding
but to deliver the baby as quickly and safely as possible. Removing
the placenta is especially worrisome, because potentially lethal
blood mixes with amniotic fluid and spills over the operating
drapes.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley's surgery was uneventful, and her baby girl, although
small, seemed to thrive. She longed to nurse her daughter, but she
had to give her formula to avoid transmitting the virus through
breast milk.
</P>
<P>
   When the time came to test the baby for HIV, Ashley burst into
tears. When the test results came back, she cried again. The child
had escaped infection.
</P>
<P>
   The parents named her Hope.

<P>
   ``I've been dreaming about having a baby,'' Ashley said.
</P>
<P>
   That's not a strange thing for a childless 36-year-old woman to
tell her gynecologist, but it surprised me because this patient is
HIV-infected. Having a baby implies having a future, something that
those of us who have watched women die of AIDS once never dared
hope for.
</P>
<P>
   But Ashley has always been tenacious. Six years ago, the
boyfriend who introduced her to heroin and HIV died of pneumonia,
leaving her resolved to convince others not to duplicate her
mistakes. She began speaking in schools, women's shelters and
halfway houses. Before long she met Ron, another former drug user
who is HIV positive.
</P>
<P>
   Their collaboration in the fight against AIDS inspired a love
bold enough to include the prospect of having a child.
</P>
<P>
   When Ashley came under my care a few years ago, she told me she
had initially fought against AIDS with little hope of victory. But
in 1994, she participated in a landmark study. The results
demonstrated that a combination drug therapy including inhibitors
of the HIV protease enzyme, begun early in the course of infection,
could reduce the virus to undetectable levels in blood samples and
prolong life.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley began to dream of having a child. She read all she could
about her disease and the latest advances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been thinking about this for a long time,'' she finally
said, as we sat together in a conference room, ``but it seemed so
unfair to bear a child I'd never be there for. Now, for the first
time since my diagnosis, I feel like there might be a life for me.
I want your perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   I took a long breath. Until recently, children born with HIV
usually died as infants or toddlers, from diarrhea, pneumonia or
meningitis. Thanks to advances in antiviral therapy, those days are
largely past, and children born with HIV now live into their teens
and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, results from the Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group,
a national consortium of clinicians and patients involved in
experimental studies, showed that when mothers were treated with
the anti-HIV drug zidovudine during late pregnancy and labor, only
8 percent of the babies were born HIV-infected. Among women given
placebos, 26 percent of the babies were born HIV-infected.
</P>
<P>
   By lessening the amount of HIV in the mother's blood, zidovudine
reduced the exposure of the baby to blood-borne virus during
delivery.
</P>
<P>
   More recent studies have deepened our understanding of anti-HIV
drug therapy. When mothers take zidovudine along with protease
inhibitors and other drugs, the risk is much lower than when they
take zidovudine alone. In Ashley's case the infection was
relatively well controlled. At 397, her CD4 count, the number of
infection-fighting T cells, was OK, and the virus in her blood was
too low to show up in tests.
</P>
<P>
   Staying healthy required a complicated drug regimen: pills taken
up to five times each day, some with food, some on an empty
stomach. But Ashley was nothing if not dedicated.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't see her until she returned six months later for her
annual Pap smear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying,'' she told me. ``Some people tell me that it's
selfish, that any risk of handing on this disease is too great. But
to me, having a baby is standing up to the virus. We think it's
time to look ahead, to create life, not just avoid dying.''
</P>
<P>
   We talked about the ethical issues her pregnancy raised. We
talked about how HIV mutates rapidly, and the same viral strain can
evolve differently in different individuals with different immune
systems and genetic makeups.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley accepted that if Ron stopped using condoms it was
theoretically possible that she might get infected with a more
virulent strain of HIV. She understood that in the months or years
to come the virus she carried might become resistant to drugs,
killing her before her baby had a chance to know her. She had made
plans: Her sister had agreed to raise the child if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Within three months, Ashley was pregnant. She faced morning
sickness, which compounded the nausea caused by her anti-HIV drugs.
Twice she had to be admitted to the hospital because she could not
keep any liquids or anti-retroviral medications down.
</P>
<P>
   But with an antiemetic patch behind her ear, she managed to keep

<P>
   Jan Bruckner, a professor of physical therapy at Thomas
Jefferson University in Philadelphia, heads across campus for a 10
a.m. appointment at the Human Performance Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   There, Gary Sylvester, one of Bruckner's students, nervously
waits. He has responded to her standing offer to examine any pupil
who complains of foot pain.
</P>
<P>
   Bruckner begins the evaluation by asking his age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-three,'' he announces.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of 23?'' says an older woman being treated for a serious
foot problem in the same lab. She listens jealously as Sylvester
explains that he runs 15 miles a week. His feet rub inside his
shoes, get raw around the toes and develop blisters.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvester is far from alone. After years of clinical practice,
anthropological research and pioneering studies, Bruckner has
concluded that, biomechanically speaking, there's no such thing as
a normal human foot.
</P>
<P>
   Instead there is a spectrum of variations. Biologically, the
foot remains a work in progress, and it needs a lot more help from
the shoe industry than it's getting.
</P>
<P>
   If Sylvester hadn't bothered to show up today, his blisters
could have easily led to heel spurs and then to instability in his
ankles and knees. Eventually his minor complaint would have turned
into chronic pain. But because he is still young, a simple,
custom-made shoe insert designed by Bruckner will save his feet.
</P>
<P>
   Bruckner is a quiet, polite revolutionary driven to save the
world's feet. She has worked in relative obscurity, refining her
theories of the lowest human appendage for 15 years without major
grants or corporate backing. Her work has become a crusade.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, after eight years of practicing physical therapy,
Bruckner wanted more information about the foot's biomechanics. To
that end, she enrolled in the physical anthropology program at
Indiana University.
</P>
<P>
   She began reading old anthropology studies about bones and
joints, work considered irrelevant in the medical community.
</P>
<P>
   ``I discovered something that they'd never taught me when I
studied anatomy in physical therapy,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   A few anthropologists had written about a wide range of shapes
and configurations of the human foot, variations that modern
textbooks never mention. In particular, the shape of the talus bone
_ directly above the heel and below the lower leg bone _ differs
widely among humans.
</P>
<P>
   Visually, these anomalies don't amount to much. Mechanically,
however, Bruckner suspected they might mean a great deal.
</P>
<P>
   The variations that seemed most important to her occur in a
joint called the subtalar, where the rounded talus bone fits into
the knobby calcaneus, or heel bone.
</P>
<P>
   The bones' irregular forms usually touch each other at two or
three distinct points called facets. Bruckner realized that a joint
with three facets would be stable and rigid, like a stool with
three legs, and would restrict motion and allow more shock to shoot
through the foot into neighboring joints.
</P>
<P>
   Two-faceted joints, on the other hand, would allow greater
flexibility. Three facets looked like trouble, but Bruckner wasn't
sure how that variation affected modern humans. It turned out that
nobody else knew either.
</P>
<P>
   To find out, Bruckner needed lots of feet. She began with the
dead. Because she taught in the physical-therapy department at the
university's medical school, she had access to the cadavers used in
anatomy classes. She dissected the feet of more than 30 bodies and
tallied more three-faceted than two-faceted joints.
</P>
<P>
   More disturbing, she found that one-third of the bodies had a
two-faceted joint in one foot but a three-faceted joint in the
other, or vice versa, violating left-right symmetry found elsewhere
in the body. In her small but random sample, Bruckner didn't find a
single normal pair of feet.
</P>
<P>
   She began to wonder what happens to the knees, hips and lower
backs in people who have mismatched shock absorbers in their feet.
</P>
<P>
   To continue her research on the living without using surgery,
she developed a technique for wiggling patients' heels to reveal
three-faceted joints. But she still needed a live group of research
subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Bruckner found them by chance when she filled in as a temporary
physical therapist with the Tohono O'odham (pronounced like autumn)
tribe of southern Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, Bruckner struck a deal with the tribe: She agreed to
work at the reservation's clinic without pay if she could examine
the feet of any willing member of the tribe. Because the O'odham
are a relatively homogeneous population, Bruckner half expected to
find almost no variations in their feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're about as close to genetically isolated as you're going
to find in North America,'' she says. Instead, she found wide
deviation in the subtalar joints.
</P>
<P>
   She still needed a research pool more diverse than the O'odham.
In the winter of 1989, the Persian Gulf War delivered them almost
to her front door.
</P>
<P>
   As troops were shipped to the gulf, Bruckner went to work for
the U.S. Army at Fort Benjamin Harrison in Indiana. She worked for
free, under the proviso that she could examine the healthy feet of
anyone on the base who volunteered for her research.
</P>
<P>
   Again she found plenty of variation _ and something else. If a
soldier had a three-faceted joint in one foot and a two-faceted in
the other, the odds for injury were higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was even more devastating than facet configuration,'' she
says, ``was asymmetry.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruckner finally had enough data to support her theory, but she
didn't stop there. Bruckner approached the captain in charge of the
clinic at Fort Benjamin Harrison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `You have to stop issuing shoes by the pair. Issue
shoes by the each. The soldiers in our clinic with problems have
one foot significantly different from the other.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Lady,'' she remembers his saying, ``this is the Army. We can't
do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruckner didn't give up on her dream of perfect shoes for the
masses. In 1996, she met Dimitris Metaxas, a computer scientist at
the University of Pennsylvania. He invited her to a look at a
trademarked program called Jack, a computer model of a person who
exists only on-screen and was designed to create better
workstations.
</P>
<P>
   Bruckner immediately saw the program's potential to help her
design shoes to fit every foot in the world perfectly. But while
Jack's upper body seemed to accurately replicate a human's, his
feet were another story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack walked like a robot,'' she says. ``Jack had no subtalar
joints. His feet looked like slabs of meat.''
</P>
<P>
   Although jack is now owned by a private company that contracts
the program to corporations, his existence lured Bruckner to
Philadelphia: She needed virtual patients to model virtual shoes,
and the center's programmers could build them.
</P>
<P>
   Two computer models are under development. One is a gait model
that walks according to an individual's variations. Until now,
every gait model worked from an ideal algorithm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody walks like anybody else, much less with an ideal
gait,'' Bruckner says.
</P>
<P>
   The other model represents a person's foot, facilitating
shoe-design for individual needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to se two programs together and run clinical
studies. I want to use these intelligent programs to fabricate
shoes and make orthotics.''
</P>
<P>
   From the feet of mankind comes a heartfelt thank-you.

   Again she found plenty of variation _ and something else. If a
soldier had a three-faceted joint in one foot and a two-faceted in
the other, the odds for injury were higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was even more devastating than facet configuration,'' she
says, ``was asymmetry.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruckner finally had enough data to support her theory, but she
didn't stop there. Bruckner approached the captain in charge of the
clinic at Fort Benjamin Harrison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `You have to stop issuing shoes by the pair. Issue
shoes by the each. The soldiers in our clinic with problems have
one foot significantly different from the other.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Lady,'' she remembers his saying, ``this is the Army. We can't
do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruckner didn't give up on her dream of perfect shoes for the
masses. In 1996, she met Dimitris Metaxas, a computer scientist at
the University of Pennsylvania. He invited her to a look at a
trademarked program called Jack, a computer model of a person who
exists only on-screen and was designed to create better
workstations.
</P>
<P>
   Bruckner immediately saw the program's potential to help her
design shoes to fit every foot in the world perfectly. But while
Jack's upper body seemed to accurately replicate a human's, his
feet were another story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack walked like a robot,'' she says. ``Jack had no subtalar
joints. His feet looked like slabs of meat.''
</P>
<P>
   Although jack is now owned by a private company that contracts
the program to corporations, his existence lured Bruckner to
Philadelphia: She needed virtual patients to model virtual shoes,
and the center's programmers could build them.
</P>
<P>
   Two computer models are under development. One is a gait model
that walks according to an individual's variations. Until now,
every gait model worked from an ideal algorithm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody walks like anybody else, much less with an ideal
gait,'' Bruckner says.
</P>
<P>
   The other model represents a person's foot, facilitating
shoe-design for individual needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to put these two programs together and run clinical
studies. I want to use these intelligent programs to fabricate
shoes and make orthotics.''
</P>
<P>
   From the feet of mankind comes a heartfelt thank-you.

<P>
   ``I've been dreaming about having a baby,'' Ashley said.
</P>
<P>
   That's not a strange thing for a childless 36-year-old woman to
tell her gynecologist, but it surprised me because this patient is
HIV-infected. Having a baby implies having a future, something that
those of us who have watched women die of AIDS once never dared
hope for.
</P>
<P>
   But Ashley has always been tenacious. Six years ago, the
boyfriend who introduced her to heroin and HIV died of pneumonia,
leaving her resolved to convince others not to duplicate her
mistakes. She began speaking in schools, women's shelters and
halfway houses. Before long she met Ron, another former drug user
who is HIV positive.
</P>
<P>
   Their collaboration in the fight against AIDS inspired a love
bold enough to include the prospect of having a child.
</P>
<P>
   When Ashley came under my care a few years ago, she told me she
had initially fought against AIDS with little hope of victory. But
in 1994, she participated in a landmark study. The results
demonstrated that a combination drug therapy including inhibitors
of the HIV protease enzyme, begun early in the course of infection,
could reduce the virus to undetectable levels in blood samples and
prolong life.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley began to dream of having a child. She read all she could
about her disease and the latest advances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been thinking about this for a long time,'' she finally
said, as we sat together in a conference room, ``but it seemed so
unfair to bear a child I'd never be there for. Now, for the first
time since my diagnosis, I feel like there might be a life for me.
I want your perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   I took a long breath. Until recently, children born with HIV
usually died as infants or toddlers, from diarrhea, pneumonia or
meningitis. Thanks to advances in antiviral therapy, those days are
largely past, and children born with HIV now live into their teens
and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, results from the Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group,
a national consortium of clinicians and patients involved in
experimental studies, showed that when mothers were treated with
the anti-HIV drug zidovudine during late pregnancy and labor, only
8 percent of the babies were born HIV-infected. Among women given
placebos, 26 percent of the babies were born HIV-infected.
</P>
<P>
   By lessening the amount of HIV in the mother's blood, zidovudine
reduced the exposure of the baby to blood-borne virus during
delivery.
</P>
<P>
   More recent studies have deepened our understanding of anti-HIV
drug therapy. When mothers take zidovudine along with protease
inhibitors and other drugs, the risk is much lower than when they
take zidovudine alone. In Ashley's case the infection was
relatively well controlled. At 397, her CD4 count, the number of
infection-fighting T cells, was OK, and the virus in her blood was
too low to show up in tests.
</P>
<P>
   Staying healthy required a complicated drug regimen: pills taken
up to five times each day, some with food, some on an empty
stomach. But Ashley was nothing if not dedicated.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't see her until she returned six months later for her
annual Pap smear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying,'' she told me. ``Some people tell me that it's
selfish, that any risk of handing on this disease is too great. But
to me, having a baby is standing up to the virus. We think it's
time to look ahead, to create life, not just avoid dying.''
</P>
<P>
   We talked about the ethical issues her pregnancy raised. We
talked about how HIV mutates rapidly, and the same viral strain can
evolve differently in different individuals with different immune
systems and genetic makeups.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley accepted that if Ron stopped using condoms it was
theoretically possible that she might get infected with a more
virulent strain of HIV. She understood that in the months or years
to come the virus she carried might become resistant to drugs,
killing her before her baby had a chance to know her. She had made
plans: Her sister had agreed to raise the child if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Within three months, Ashley was pregnant. She faced morning
sickness, which compounded the nausea caused by her anti-HIV drugs.
Twice she had to be admitted to the hospital because she could not
keep any liquids or anti-retroviral medications down.
</P>
<P>
   But with an antiemetic patch behind her ear, she managed to keep
taking her pills, even when she could swallow nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   By the 15th week of pregnancy, Ashley's appetite returned. The
next issue she faced was amniocentesis. For pregnant women of her
age, genetic testing is standard to identify babies with Down
syndrome and other defects. But the needle required to draw cells
from the amniotic fluid can introduce HIV into the fetus.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley decided to forgo the procedure, as HIV-infected mothers
are advised to do, and get a detailed ultrasound instead. Her
knuckles were white as she clutched Ron's hand during the
procedure, but the ultrasound was fine.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley's contractions started early during her third trimester.
Soon after, she quit work to rest in bed. Weekly ultrasound scans
showed the baby growing and kicking, stretching in anticipation of
birth.
</P>
<P>
   How to deliver the baby was the next critical issue. Cesarean
section reduces the risk of HIV transmission to the child because
the baby encounters the mother's virus-infected blood only briefly
during the procedure. Unfortunately, the risks to the mother _
infection, bleeding and anesthetic complications _ are higher for
cesareans than for vaginal deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that matters is protecting my child. I'll take the
knife,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Eight months into the pregnancy, Ashley's contractions picked up
again. Her cervix softened and began to open. We had to perform the
cesarean before the bag of amniotic fluid broke, exposing the baby
to virus in the mother's body.
</P>
<P>
   Like any surgical procedure, cesarean section requires all the
usual precautions: gowns, masks, gloves. But in the age of AIDS, we
have added new barriers. The masks have shields to protect against
splashes of blood. The gowns are impermeable. Everyone on the
operating team wears two sets of gloves, and shoes are covered with
knee-high gaiters.
</P>
<P>
   Still, performing a cesarean section on a woman with HIV is
frightening because the initial focus is not to stop the bleeding
but to deliver the baby as quickly and safely as possible. Removing
the placenta is especially worrisome, because potentially lethal
blood mixes with amniotic fluid and spills over the operating
drapes.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley's surgery was uneventful, and her baby girl, although
small, seemed to thrive. She longed to nurse her daughter, but she
had to give her formula to avoid transmitting the virus through
breast milk.
</P>
<P>
   When the time came to test the baby for HIV, Ashley burst into
tears. When the test results came back, she cried again. The child
had escaped infection.
</P>
<P>
   The parents named her Hope.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   ``I just voted against a national day of prayer, fasting and
`humiliation before God,''' says Loretta Sanchez, rolling her eyes
as she walks off the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives.
``These are the votes we're taking these days: `I can hang up more
commandments than you can.'''
</P>
<P>
   The California Democrat is disgusted, yes, but three years after
a vicious campaign battle with one of the loudest voices in
American conservatism, Bob Dornan, Sanchez also finds her
right-wing opponents strangely amusing. Even Helen Chenoweth, the
pro-militia congresswoman from Idaho who called for that national
day of ``humiliation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a wacko. But she probably meant `humility,''' says
Sanchez, who's willing to give Chenoweth the benefit of the doubt
because ``it's part of being Catholic. We always feel guilty, and
we always wear a slip.''
</P>
<P>
   Petite, flirtatious and easy to underestimate, Sanchez, 39, has
gone from being a political unknown largely written off by the
Democratic establishment to co-chairman of the party.
</P>
<P>
   She's also high on Hillary Rodham Clinton's list of pals to help
campaign in New York's Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one ever got anywhere by slaying an ant,'' says Clinton
campaign strategist James Carville, ``and she's a dragon killer.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez proved her feistiness in 1996, when she ousted Dornan
from his House seat by fewer than 1,000 votes. Stunned by his loss
after 10 terms, Dornan convinced the Republican leadership to
launch a congressional inquiry, with an idea of throwing Sanchez
out of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It cost me $800,000 to win my first election and another
million dollars to hold onto my seat,'' she says of the 17-month
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Dornan came up with proof that more than 500 noncitizens had
voted, but unable to prove the election results wrong, the
Republicans dropped the charges. Then Sanchez whipped Dornan again
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez is generating less buzz about her legislative program _
as a junior member, she doesn't have much of an agenda to speak of
_ than about her ability to ignite the Hispanic vote, which could
play a key role in a presidential race between Vice President Al
Gore and Texas Governor George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   She admits that getting the growing demographic group to the
polls is a challenge, because, she says, ``a lot of Hispanics come
from a system where politics is not good.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez's own father, based on his experience growing up in
Mexico, warned her against running for office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good politicians get shot,'' he told her, ``and the bad ones
are bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Married for 10 years to securities trader Stephen Brixey,
Sanchez holds an MBA from American University and got her early
education compliments of the Great Society's antipoverty program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a Head Start kid, but I never realized I was poor,'' she
insists, smiling demurely as she moves in to attack. ``I didn't
know the program was aimed at the disadvantaged until 1993, when I
read in the paper about the Republicans not wanting to fund it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's Sanchez's reputation for such sugarcoated toughness that
makes her a favorite with Democrats and moderate Republicans alike,
and she has wasted no time making powerful friends.
</P>
<P>
   Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo gushes, ``She's junior in terms
of time served in Congress, but she's senior in terms of talent.''
</P>
<P>
   And Gore gave her the cushy job of helping dispense money to
candidates from his PAC. But she bristles when asked whether the
vice president is entitled to next year's nomination by dint of his
eight years served.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shouldn't go to Al Gore just by virtue of inheritance,''
she says. ``You're talking to a person who nobody thought would
win, especially not in the primary, when the party was helping
someone else. As a Democratic chairperson, my role is to ensure
those people who want to run have the chance.''
</P>
<P>
   And Sanchez admits the vice president needs to loosen up.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he's in my district, he's not stiff,'' she says. ``But
then I turn on CSPAN and see him campaigning in New Hampshire and I
say, `Oh my God, what is this guy doing?'''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez is anxiously awaiting next summer's Democratic
convention in Los Angeles _ politics aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've only been to one before, in Chicago in 1996,'' she
recalls. But as a dark horse, she adds, ``I didn't get to see any
of the fun stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, Sanchez will be getting invitations to all the best
parties, along with Barbra Streisand, Rob Reiner, Warren Beatty and
Annette Bening _ all of whom contributed to her second race.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't mean I can pick up the phone and say, `Hi, I'm
Loretta. Can you come over and do a concert now, Barbra?''' she
says, pausing to consider her own celebrity status. ``But I'm sure
some of them would say yes.''

pro-militia congresswoman from Idaho who called for that national
day of ``humiliation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a wacko. But she probably meant `humility,''' says
Sanchez, who's willing to give Chenoweth the benefit of the doubt
because ``it's part of being Catholic. We always feel guilty, and
we always wear a slip.''
</P>
<P>
   Petite, flirtatious and easy to underestimate, Sanchez, 39, has
gone from being a political unknown largely written off by the
Democratic establishment to co-chairman of the party.
</P>
<P>
   She's also high on Hillary Rodham Clinton's list of pals to help
campaign in New York's Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one ever got anywhere by slaying an ant,'' says Clinton
campaign strategist James Carville, ``and she's a dragon killer.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez proved her feistiness in 1996, when she ousted Dornan
from his House seat by fewer than 1,000 votes. Stunned by his loss
after 10 terms, Dornan convinced the Republican leadership to
launch a congressional inquiry, with an idea of throwing Sanchez
out of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It cost me $800,000 to win my first election and another
million dollars to hold onto my seat,'' she says of the 17-month
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Dornan came up with proof that more than 500 noncitizens had
voted, but unable to prove the election results wrong, the
Republicans dropped the charges. Then Sanchez whipped Dornan again
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez is generating less buzz about her legislative program _
as a junior member, she doesn't have much of an agenda to speak of
_ than about her ability to ignite the Hispanic vote, which could
play a key role in a presidential race between Vice President Al
Gore and Texas Governor George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   She admits that getting the growing demographic group to the
polls is a challenge, because, she says, ``a lot of Hispanics come
from a system where politics is not good.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez's own father, based on his experience growing up in
Mexico, warned her against running for office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good politicians get shot,'' he told her, ``and the bad ones
are bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Married for 10 years to securities trader Stephen Brixey,
Sanchez holds an MBA from American University and got her early
education compliments of the Great Society's antipoverty program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a Head Start kid, but I never realized I was poor,'' she
insists, smiling demurely as she moves in to attack. ``I didn't
know the program was aimed at the disadvantaged until 1993, when I
read in the paper about the Republicans not wanting to fund it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's Sanchez's reputation for such sugarcoated toughness that
makes her a favorite with Democrats and moderate Republicans alike,
and she has wasted no time making powerful friends.
</P>
<P>
   Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo gushes, ``She's junior in terms
of time served in Congress, but she's senior in terms of talent.''
</P>
<P>
   And Gore gave her the cushy job of helping dispense money to
candidates from his PAC. But she bristles when asked whether the
vice president is entitled to next year's nomination by dint of his
eight years served.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shouldn't go to Al Gore just by virtue of inheritance,''
she says. ``You're talking to a person who nobody thought would
win, especially not in the primary, when the party was helping
someone else. As a Democratic chairperson, my role is to ensure
those people who want to run have the chance.''
</P>
<P>
   And Sanchez admits the vice president needs to loosen up.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he's in my district, he's not stiff,'' she says. ``But
then I turn on CSPAN and see him campaigning in New Hampshire and I
say, `Oh my God, what is this guy doing?'''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez is anxiously awaiting next summer's Democratic
convention in Los Angeles _ politics aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've only been to one before, in Chicago in 1996,'' she
recalls. But as a dark horse, she adds, ``I didn't get to see any
of the fun stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, Sanchez will be getting invitations to all the best
parties, along with Barbra Streisand, Rob Reiner, Warren Beatty and
Annette Bening _ all of whom contributed to her second race.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't mean I can pick up the phone and say, `Hi, I'm
Loretta. Can you come over and do a concert now, Barbra?''' she
says, pausing to consider her own celebrity status. ``But I'm sure
some of them would say yes.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Calvin Klein has another musical production on his
hands.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, once again, there will be hardly a super in sight _
with the exception of Christy Turlington for underwear. The CK
Calvin Klein Jeans campaign, shot again by Steven Klein, features
cutting-edge musicians who are not household names yet, but are
making waves in the music scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Calvin Klein Jeans ads are still edgy, contemporary and
not mass,'' said Calvin Klein, in a recent interview at his office.
The ads are built around Klein's new ``Dirty Denim'' collection,
which hits stores this month.
</P>
<P>
   While Klein declined to discuss his spring print budget for CK
Jeans, CK Collection, Calvin Klein Collection and Accessories and
Underwear, he said the print buy is even with last year, but he'll
spend slightly more overall with additional outdoor, postcards and
online banner ads.
</P>
<P>
   Among the musicians featured in the jeans campaign are Joshua
Todd of Buck Cherry, a punk and hard rock blues band; Lisa (Left
Eye) Lopez of TLC, who is coming out with her own solo album; Macy
Gray, a rhythm and blues and soul artist; David Silveria of Korn, a
hard-core rock band; and Tim Wheeler and Charlotte Hatherley of
Ash, a U.K. group.
</P>
<P>
   There's also Moby, a techno artist; Shakira, a Latin-American
pop-rock singer and songwriter; Delores O'Riordan of the
Cranberries; D.J. Rap, a U.K. deejay; and Ja Rule, a hard-core
rapper who plays the lead in Madonna's upcoming movie, ``Ghetto
Superstar.''
</P>
<P>
   The ads were shot in a New York studio, using a variety of
striking backgrounds, ranging from colorful sunsets and mountains
to bolts of lightning.
</P>
<P>
   Klein said that while fashion designers may have their own brand
of hang-ups and attitudes about who they're grouped with in certain
situations, musicians are even worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have tremendous attitudes about who's cool and who's
not,'' said Klein, adding that many wanted to know who else was in
the campaign before they agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very aware of who else is doing this campaign,'' said
Klein. The designer said he wanted to limit the campaign to people
``who are critically well accepted, but are just not that well
known.''
</P>
<P>
   Does he think being in the Calvin Klein campaign will help their
budding musical careers?
</P>
<P>
   ``If it does, great. I think people are doing it to be a part of
it. They think it's fun and cool. And we think they're so cool and
talented.''
</P>
<P>
   And what budding rocker or rapper wouldn't want a double-page
spread of themselves in a fashion, music, entertainment or men's
magazine or, for that matter, a huge billboard overlooking Ninth
Avenue?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love nothing more than having a great picture of myself in
an ad,'' admitted Klein.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what's so much fun about this?'' he added. ``I just
got a letter from Liz Phair (who's featured in the current fall
campaign), and she's really cool. We're photographing portraits of
these people, and we put on their makeup and clothes. They thank us
for being part of such a really glamorous campaign. They think it's
glamorous to be in our campaign, and I have such respect for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I think of denim and jeans, I automatically think of
music,'' Klein added, in that both have universal reach.
</P>
<P>
   The jeans ads will run in a host of magazines, including Rolling
Stone, Spin, Vibe, Alternative Press, Teen People, Seventeen, YM,
InStyle, Interview, Time Out and Paper.
</P>
<P>
   In January, five different ads will appear on the back cover of
Rolling Stone, which will be shrink-wrapped with the musicians'
respective CDs for newsstand sales.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the ads will break in February magazines, and the images
will also appear on walls _ a new one will go up on 14th Street and
Ninth Avenue on Jan. 15 _ and Max Racks postcards.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing a tie-in begun this fall, the musicians will also
appear on the CKJ Network, which is part of MTV.com. Each of the
artists decided which songs they wanted to put on the Web site,
which can be downloaded, and browsers can also find information
about the members of the ad campaign. The new series goes up Jan.
15.
</P>
<P>
   While musicians are the driving force in the CK Jeans campaign,
actors are the focus in the CK Calvin Klein sportswear ads.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the CK campaign are Chris Klein, who appears in
``American Pie''; Elodie Bouchez, featured in ``La Vie
Revedesanges,'' for which she won the Best Actress award at the
Cannes Film Festival; Jimmy Fallon, who appears on ``Saturday Night
Live,'' and Vanessa Shaw, who was in ``Eyes Wide Shut'' and will
appear with Sean Penn in the upcoming film ``Los Angeles Without a
Map.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the actors are photographed against a graphic backdrop
that resembles a burning city.
</P>
<P>
   ``And people say I don't like colors,'' said Klein, when a
visitor took note of an apocalyptic firestorm image in several of
the ads.
</P>
<P>
   Again, Klein said he went with actors who aren't major stars
yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much more interesting to discuss. This is an American
thing. We always want something new and fresh, the next new thing.
Especially in the fashion business. The other side of that is when
you choose someone who's so well known, it shows no creative
thought at all. To use Gwyneth Paltrow in advertising right now,
you don't have to be a genius. You just have to spend millions of
dollars. If you wanted to use her before she became a star, it's
much more interesting,'' said Klein, an obvious reference to his
idea to feature Paltrow several seasons ago before she was a major
star. The timing for Calvin didn't work out then, but this holiday,
Paltrow appears in the Christian Dior handbag campaign.
</P>
<P>
   As for Calvin Klein Collection, Klein chose Collette, the
Russian model who opened and closed his spring runway show. Klein
considered using her as the Collection model for the fall campaign,
but he was afraid she was too thin and he'd get too much flak.
Well, she's still thin, but Klein insists she's put on weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little concerned about the weight. She's gained
weight. She's a very healthy young woman,'' said Klein.
</P>
<P>
   The men's campaign has Justin Chambers, who appeared previously
in Contradiction for Men, Men's Collection and jeans ads.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to the Calvin Klein Underwear business, which, as
reported, added J.C. Penney to its list of clients, Klein refused
to talk about it and deferred all questions to Linda J. Wachner,
who owns the Calvin Klein Underwear business. The ads are sexy and
steamy, though, and once again star Christy Turlington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those photographs are really sexier than in the past,'' said
Klein. ``They're in a place where there's not a lot of furniture,
and there's a sense of them being in their place.''
</P>
<P>
   The Underwear ads were shot by Mario Testino and focus on
Klein's women's foundation business. The male ads, which feature
Michael Walton, highlight the new microfiber briefs and trunks.
</P>
<P>
   One of the women's underwear ads show images of Turlington lying
on a shag carpet.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's gotten much more confident and not as afraid,'' said
Klein. ``She was always very controlled and gorgeous. She's growing
up and a woman now. She's a real sexy woman now.''

THE FIGHT TO SAVE `SUPERNOVA' 
</HEADLINE>

 (She also has information on how to subscribe to Inside Trek, a
weekly science-fiction column with color and black-and-white art.) (Includes a color slide and a black-and-white photo of Lou Diamond
Phillips in a scene from ``Supernova.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Diamond in the rough or unsalvageable hunk of junk?
 &HT;    On Jan. 14, moviegoers can decide for themselves precisely what
``Supernova'' is ... or was.
 &HT;    For those unaware of the ``Supernova'' saga, it's the
otherworldly tale of a would-be sci-fi blockbuster that wrapped
production in early 1998 _ with Walter Hill directing a cast that
included Angela Bassett, Lou Diamond Phillips, Robin Tunney, James
Spader, Robert Forster, Wilson Cruz and Peter Facinelli _ and has
since been subject to a series of re-edits, directorial contretemps
and release-date delays.
 &HT;    ``It is an incredibly ambitious film,'' Phillips says. ``It is,
or at least it was at the time we were working on it, more of a
cerebral sci-fi film.
 &HT;    ``I don't know what it has become,'' he adds. ``It was not a
slam-bang-'em-up. It depended on a lot of plot twists, and there
was character development going on in the piece.''
 &HT;    Phillips, the 37-year-old star of ``La Bamba,'' ``Stand and
Deliver'' and the recent ``Bats,'' signed on for ``Supernova''
because he felt Hill was taking a fairly straight-ahead story and
molding it into something interesting.
 &HT;    ``I'd actually passed on the original script,'' he recalls,
``because I didn't think the characters were there. When Walter,
who was instrumental in shaping the `Alien' franchise, came in, he
individualized each character and gave us all something specific to
do.''
 &HT;    And how did Hill improve Phillips' character, Yerzy Penalosa,
the doctor aboard the medical-rescue vessel Nightingale 229?
 &HT;    ``They gave him a love interest, for one,'' replies Phillips,
speaking by telephone from his Los Angeles home. ``I never get the
girl, man. In `Courage Under Fire' I worked with Meg Ryan,
America's sweetheart _ and I shot her.
 &HT;    ``Penalosa became a guy who's in love and gets very jealous,''
he says. ``There were two big twists in the film I thought were
very, very clever. One of them I can't reveal, but the other is
primary setup _ we find the Fountain of Youth in space.
 &HT;    ``This alien object brought aboard our ship has the ability to
reverse the aging process,'' the actor says, ``and I get involved
in a love triangle with Robin Tunney and Peter Facinelli, the guy
who brings this alien object on board.
 &HT;    ``For me, all of a sudden, there was something to play,''
Phillips adds. ``Before, I felt we were all these straight-ahead,
stock action figures. Walter came in and gave each character a
little wrinkle, something we could hang our hats on.
 &HT;    ``So we had something we could really play amidst all the
unfolding action.''
 &HT;    But rumors from the set suggest that MGM executives kept a tight
rein on Hill, forcing him to account for every minor change, for
every extra cent spent. In all his days as an actor, Phillips
acknowledges, he's never witnessed so many set visits by studio
suits.
 &HT;    Things only got worse. After filming ended, Hill and the studio
apparently failed to see eye-to-eye on the editing. Hill left the
project, and director Jack Sholder was called in to assemble
``Supernova.'' Phillips reports that he got the impression that
Sholder was trying to transform ``Supernova'' into more of a
traditional sci-fi/action film.
 &HT;    Then came an offer the producers couldn't refuse.
 &HT;    Francis Ford Coppola, director of the ``Godfather'' films and a
member of MGM/UA's board of directors, swooped in to save the day.
And so it is that ``Supernova,'' edited by Coppola and most likely
bearing a pseudonymous director's credit _ did someone page Alan
Smithee? _ will explode into theaters on Jan. 14.
 &HT;    ``This has been a fascinating process, a Hollywood film of the
highest order,'' Phillips says. ``At the end of the day, we can
say, `Francis Coppola finished the film.'
 &HT;    ``I received a wonderful letter from Francis,'' the actor adds.
``He liked the film, and asked for the opportunity to come up with
a product that the studio would be happy with and that he hoped
Walter Hill would be happy with.
 &HT;    ``It's yet to be known whether or not he achieved that,''
Phillips admits, ``but in his letter he stressed the importance of
maintaining the film's original concept. He even tossed out the
phrase `big-budget art film.'
 &HT;    ``So we'll see.''

`WHERE'S THE CORPSE' NOT ALWAYS A DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The last-ditch courtroom defense for anybody
charged with murder is to claim, ``I hear voices.'' Nobody ever
explains why those voices always say, ``Kill this person,'' instead
of, ``Go shopping naked,'' or ``Paint the house plaid.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows what Dr. Robert Bierenbaum's defense will be to
charges that he killed his wife and dumped her body at sea from his
private plane, but it's likely to be, ``Where's the corpse?''
</P>
<P>
   That's because proving murder generally requires, at a minimum,
hard evidence that the victim is dead. That has not kept the
Manhattan district attorney's office, however, from beginning to
prosecute this Albany Medical College graduate. The D.A.'s office
won't discuss its proof that Bierenbaum offed his wife, Gail, 14
years ago, but it seems to revolve around Bierenbaum's famous
temper _ that and something told investigators by a girlfriend the
plastic surgeon later romanced after moving to Las Vegas.
Bierenbaum lived and worked there before moving again to North
Dakota, where he now has a new wife and small child.
</P>
<P>
   Bierenbaum, 44, is the son of two wealthy New Jersey doctors.
The missing wife, Gail, was prone to depression and had attempted
suicide before disappearing in 1985 after yet one more nasty fight
with her husband. She had previously reported to the police that
her cranky husband had choked not only her but her cat.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Kavanagh, now a judge and for many years district attorney
of Ulster County, which is south of Albany, once got a murder
conviction without a corpse. The victim was Tony (Three Fingers)
Castellito, a Teamsters union official.
</P>
<P>
   Kavanagh put away two other mob union figures, Harold (Boom
Boom) Konigsberg and Tony (The Pro) Provenzano based largely on
testimony from a couple of thugs named Big Sal Sinno and Little
Ralphie Picardo.
</P>
<P>
   The jury heard the story of this contract killing and concluded
that Three Fingers had suffered the ultimate business setback even
though nobody knew for sure how his body had been disposed of.
Clearly, the fact that everybody here had a mob nickname helped a
lot in obtaining this conviction. And Kavanagh is the first to
admit that if he hadn't had a witness to the killing he would have
been out of luck.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Sprague, for many years the first assistant district
attorney of Philadelphia, once prosecuted a murder suspect without
a body or a witness. The defendant was a guy named Burns. He had
smacked around his live-in girlfriend, Marie Coleman, in front of
some people. Shortly thereafter, she vanished.
</P>
<P>
   From the start the cops were positive that Burns had done her
in, and they got lucky when they arrested him. As they slipped on
the cuffs, Burns boasted, ``You're gonna look like monkeys in
court. You ain't got a body.''
</P>
<P>
   Only the cops hadn't mentioned to him that they had no corpse.
</P>
<P>
   In summations to the jury, the defense lawyer was pointing out
the lack of proof that the girlfriend was even dead. As he spoke, a
women fitting the general description of Marie Coleman came into
the courtroom. Everybody gasped and stared at her. No, the defense
lawyer said, that's not Coleman. We don't know where Coleman is.
But, if even for a moment, you thought this might be her, then you
have reasonable doubt and you must acquit.
</P>
<P>
   In his own summation a few minutes later, Sprague he told the
jurors, OK, so everybody gazed at this woman when she entered
court. For a moment, everybody thought that this might be Marie
Coleman.
</P>
<P>
   One person never looked, though, Sprague pointed out. That was
Burns. He had not looked because he knew he had murdered Marie
Coleman, and this couldn't have been her.
</P>
<P>
   Sprague got his conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Now let's see if the Manhattan D.A. is quite so lucky.

PATIENTS PINE FOR TREATMENT OF LOU GEHRIG'S DISEASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Over the past two years, Linda McDonnell has lost
the ability to dress herself, hold a pencil, or walk more than 300
feet at a time. At night, she needs a machine to help her breathe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really can't do anything for myself,'' she said. ``I can
still use two fingers on the computer and I can talk on the phone.
I can't pick up a glass. I have to use a straw.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonnell has amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, better known as Lou
Gehrig's disease, named after the Yankee Hall of Famer who died
from it in 1941 at age 37.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, McDonnell has been encouraged by the attention
given her disease, by people like Oprah Winfrey and Mitch Albom,
best-selling author of ``Tuesdays with Morrie.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all the recent news is positive. Baseball great Jim
``Catfish'' Hunter died in September, a year after he was diagnosed
with ALS.
</P>
<P>
   The disease attacks nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord
that control the body's voluntary muscles. As the motor neurons
die, the muscles weaken and shrink. Early symptoms of ALS may
include clumsiness, unusual fatigue, slurred speech and difficulty
swallowing.
</P>
<P>
   McDonnell initially noticed problems in her hands. ``It started
out as little annoying symptoms,'' she said. ``I dropped keys, had
trouble turning keys, I was having trouble putting binder clips on
stacks of paper. I never thought it was anything.''
</P>
<P>
   As the disease progresses, it causes eventual paralysis and
death, usually in three to five years. Scientists don't know the
cause and there is no cure. Nor are there many treatment options
for the 30,000 Americans who suffer from ALS.
</P>
<P>
   A decision earlier this month by Cephalon Inc. of West Chester,
Pa., to stop producing an experimental drug called Myotrophin has
angered many ALS patients, who believe the drug helped slow the
progression of their disease.
</P>
<P>
   Only one drug is currently approved by the Food and Drug
Administration to treat ALS.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extremely disappointing,'' said Mary Lyon, vice president
of patient services at the ALS Association of Calabasas Hills,
Calif. (800-782-4747).
</P>
<P>
   Yet research into the disease has been encouraging over the past
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists now know that nerve cells can regrow and are focusing
their attention on developing drugs to prevent the loss of neurons
and encourage their regeneration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel like were are closing in on something that has
potential,'' said Dr. Jonathan Cooper, the director of medical
rehabilitation at St. Peter's Hospital in Albany. ``Previously
research was all over the map. They were just shooting in the
dark.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite her limitations, McDonnell is hoping to do her part to
advance the research into ALS, if not slow the progression of her
own illness, by participating in a clinical trial to test an
experimental drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least I'm doing something proactive to help with the
research,'' she said. ``Someone has to do this. Someone has to
volunteer. I'm still physically able to do it and I'm more than
willing to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   She receives a daily injection of either a placebo or a dose of
BDNF, a naturally occurring human protein that researchers hope
will prove helpful in extending the lives of ALS patients.
McDonnell will not know until next year, however, if she actually
received the drug or any of its potential benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figure I have nothing to lose,'' she said. ``I'm 48 years
old and I have two daughters in college. I'd like to see them
graduate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the terminal nature of the disease, if (the drug is)
going to prolong your life even by six months, hey, that's great.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, living with ALS is a daily challenge of
monumental proportions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The simplest things in life become very difficult to manage,''
Cooper said. ``We try to help people maintain their independence as
long as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Because ALS can sometimes mimic other conditions in its early
stages, many victims, including McDonnell, have trouble getting an
accurate diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just went from doctor to doctor to doctor to try to figure
out what was happening,'' she said. ``It's extremely frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, her biggest challenge is learning to live with the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went from being a generally vigorous, independent working
mom to someone who is totally dependent on someone else,'' she
said. ``You have to become very humble and swallow your pride.''

vegetables, stuffing and more are full of natural substances that

heterocyclic amines, substances which trigger DNA mutations and
cause cancer in rodents. Rats also develop cancer when fed with the
dyestuff aniline, which occurs naturally in carrots.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're feeling particularly brave, eat stuffing. There's
a whole range of nature's nasties in the bread, onions, celery,
black pepper and mushrooms that cause cancer or DNA mutations in
rodents. The stuffing ingredients include acetaldehyde, a toxic
breakdown product of alcoholic drinks, benzoapyrene, a potent
carcinogen found in cigarette smoke, and ethyl carbamate, a natural
pesticide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to get across that just because something is synthetic,
it's not inherently any more dangerous than something Mother Nature
puts there herself,'' says Ruth Kava, director of nutrition at the
American Council on Science and Health.
</P>
<P>
   The New York-based council, set up in 1978 by scientists
disturbed by media scare stories about pesticides, claims to be
independent of its 300 diverse sources of funding and backs health
campaigns it believes are based on sound science. It lost tobacco
industry funding, for example, when it denounced smoking.
</P>
<P>
   According to Kava, the council thinks that health scares about
pesticides in food are unjustified on scientific grounds. ``It's an
issue of dose and exposure,'' she adds. ``If you consume something
that's a big hazard, such as benzene, but have small exposure, say
one part per billion of benzene in your food every three months,
there's not a very big risk.''
</P>
<P>
   She calculates that you'd have to eat 82,600 slices of bread
daily for life to consume the amount of the natural substance
furfural found to cause cancer in lab rats. This means that very
few rodent carcinogens turn out to be human carcinogens. Exceptions
include natural substances such as aflatoxins, fungal contaminants
of poorly stored nuts and spices.
</P>
<P>
   Her team also warns that the risks from nature don't end with
cancer. Potatoes contain the natural toxins solanine, arsenic and
chaconine. Lima beans contain hydrogen cyanide, while carrots
contain carototoxin, a nerve poison.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigners against pesticides accept that some scare stories
are unjustified, but see the spoof menu as dangerously unbalanced
itself. ``Most natural pesticides have been in the diet for
millions of years, but DDT and the like have only been around for
50 years and we're still learning to cope with them,'' says Peter
Beaumont, director of the British-based Pesticides Trust.
``Rubbishing the opposition is not balanced science.'' &QL;

   Beware the perils on your plate this Christmas. Turkey,
vegetables, stuffing and more are full of natural substances that
give lab rats cancer, warn a group of New York scientists in a
spoof Christmas menu which they have designed to ridicule scare
stories about pesticide residues in food. But anti-pesticide
campaigners have dismissed the menu as a cheap stunt.

   Here's a sobering thought for the new millennium: over the next
15 years, the International Space Station's controllers can expect
at least one ``loss of crew member.''
</P>
<P>
   Futron, a management consultancy near Washington D.C., has
released the first results of its attempts to quantify for NASA the
risks the station's crews will face. Its ``loss of crew member''
category includes serious illness leading to the evacuation of an
astronaut, as well as deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Futron's preliminary calculations, which the company admits are
crude, considered the risks for a station crewed by three
astronauts, half way through construction, and extended this to
cover a 15-year period. In reality, of course, the size of the
space station, and the number of crew, will change.
</P>
<P>
   Experts have been badgering NASA to finish a full risk
assessment for the space station. And while they are pleased that
the agency is getting round to it, some question the details of
Futron's analysis. The consultancy suggests that accidents inside
the station are a greater risk to the astronauts than space walks.
This is a surprise, given the unprecedented amount of space-walking
needed to put the space station together.
</P>
<P>
   Futron also calculates that the chances of losing the entire
station in any eight-month period lie between one in 200 and one in
500 _ meaning there's a 5 to 10 percent chance of disaster over 15
years. But its calculations suggest that, if this happens, there is
a 93 percent probability that a micrometeorite impact will be the
cause. Futron assumes just a 2 percent chance that fires,
explosions or collisions between spacecraft would be to blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm struck by how different it is from the experience on
Mir,'' says A. Thomas Young, formerly president of the aerospace
giant Lockheed Martin. ``They've had no basic problem with
micrometeorites, but they've had problems with fires and
crashes.'' &QL;

GWYNETH PALTROW: TRYING TO FORGET ABOUT HER OSCAR

 Includes black-and-white photos and color slides of Gwyneth Paltrow
with Matt Damon in a scene from ``The Talented Mr. Ripley.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Winning her first Oscar earlier this year _ for her
career-defining performance in ``Shakespeare in Love'' (1998) _ was
a dream come true for Gwyneth Paltrow.
 &HT;    But, the 27-year-old actress says, it was also something of a
nightmare.
 &HT;    As her latest film, ``The Talented Mr. Ripley,'' prepares for a
Christmas opening, Paltrow admits that she may have been too young,
or simply too new to acting and movie stardom, to cope with the
dark side of picking up the treasured best-actress statuette. She
might have been better served, she says, if she'd had more time to
develop sufficient armor to deflect the publicity onslaught that
Oscar brings in his wake.
 &HT;    Paltrow shows up for an interview at Beverly Hills' Four Seasons
hotel looking, well, thoroughly unlike Gwyneth Paltrow. I have to
look twice, actually, to make sure that it's really her.
 &HT;    Gone is the shoulder-length, golden-blonde hair that has
reminded so many of the young Grace Kelly. Instead her locks are
dark brown, colored for her role in ``Bounce,'' which she has
recently finished shooting with her on-again/off-again boyfriend,
Ben Affleck.
 &HT;    ``I think the director of `Bounce' was sick of the whole Blonde
Gwyneth person,'' she says. ``And so was I.''
 &HT;    Wearing virtually no makeup, Paltrow nevertheless looks elegant
in an ankle-length, black-leather skirt and matching top, set off
with dazzling diamond earrings which reportedly were a gift from
Affleck.
 &HT;    The timing of her Oscar was particularly unfortunate, Paltrow
says, because her life was finally beginning to settle down after
the tabloid furor over her breakup with fiance Brad Pitt. Then
along came Oscar, and the paparazzi went on red alert.
 &HT;    ``I became a prisoner in my house,'' she recalls, ``because
after a while I just didn't want to go out. One day I was driving
and the gas gauge on my car had broken, so I ran out of gas. There
are pictures of me walking down the street with a gas can, looking
for the nearest service station, and the paparazzi didn't have the
decency to give me a ride. They just wanted those demeaning
pictures.
 &HT;    ``I wanted to go hide somewhere,'' she concludes. ``I felt I
couldn't sustain all of the energy that comes with all that
attention.''
 &HT;    The whole thing was exacerbated by the fact that her acceptance
speech became fodder for late-night comedians. Not since Sally
Field's ``You like me, you really like me'' acceptance speech for
``Norma Rae'' (l979) had so many had so much fun with so little.
 &HT;    At the time Paltrow's father was ill, her grandfather was dying
_ he has since died, and she still can't mention his name without
tears _ and her brother was also having health problems. Not
surprisingly, the actress broke down in front of the world's
largest audience.
 &HT;    ``The nightmare about that evening was that I had one of the
most personal moments of my life in front of the whole world,'' she
says. ``I felt so terribly exposed. Of course I'd like to go back
and change some things, but that's impossible. It's there for
posterity.''
 &HT;    She reacted in the only way she knew how, by turning inward and
taking stock of her life and career.
 &HT;    ``It made me see the emptiness in everything I had achieved,''
Paltrow says. ``It's wonderful and I appreciate it, but nothing you
can buy, nothing you can do, achieve or win, no boy, no
relationship will help you retain contentedness.''
 &HT;    She plunged back into work _ a stage stint at the Williamstown
Theater Festival and several upcoming films _ determined, she says,
not to let the award affect the direction of her career.
 &HT;    ``I have been working so hard not to let it make any changes in
my life,'' the actress says. ``I still only accept roles if I want
to do them, as an artist, not because they are a potential
award-winning role.''
 &HT;    One of those roles is Marge Sherwood, the beautiful, wealthy
girlfriend of Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law) in writer/director
Anthony Minghella's ``The Talented Mr. Ripley.''
 &HT;    ``I liked Marge, she was very sweet,'' Paltrow says. ``But I
didn't understand how deep she was and how layered it all was until
I got there and started doing the film. I thought she was lighter.
I didn't realize she was so deep and warm and complicated, which is
a testament to my stupidity.''
 &HT;    Based on a Patricia Highsmith novel _ one that Minghella made
Paltrow promise not to read _ and set in 1950s Italy, the movie is
the fascinating story of Tom Ripley (Matt Damon), who is asked by a
millionaire shipbuilder to persuade his playboy son Dickie to come
home. Ripley becomes so fascinated by the lavish lifestyle Dickie
and Marge enjoy that he goes to extraordinary and disturbing
lengths to become exactly like them.
 &HT;    The film is gorgeously shot in some of Italy's most glorious
locales, and Paltrow and Law are as golden a couple as anything F.
Scott Fitzgerald ever conjured up. Which isn't too surprising,
since Minghella says he wrote the screenplay with Paltrow in mind
for the role of Marge.
 &HT;    ``She was the first person I cast,'' he says in a separate
interview. ``The character of Marge in the film _ womanly,
trusting, compassionate, a rebel in her own way _ has as much to do
with Gwyneth herself as it has to do with Patricia Highsmith's
Marge.''
 &HT;    It's a dark tale, one which some critics have suggested will be
too much for mainstream American audiences. Predictably, Paltrow
disagrees.
 &HT;    ``I think it's a very different movie,'' she admits. ``It's an
epic, Hollywood movie that is totally subversive.
 &HT;    ``But I think to say it will alienate middle America is to
underestimate those people as a moviegoing audience,'' Paltrow
adds. ``They like to be challenged as much as anyone else. Our
movie is about a very lonely, desperate person who wants to be
loved and will do anything to get that love. That's a universal
trait, that people want to get out of their own lives and inhabit
someone else's.''
 &HT;    At times, it seems, even lovely, blonde Oscar-winners feel that
urge.
 &HT;    ``I never wished I had someone else's life,'' she says
thoughtfully. ``I never wanted to be someone else _ but there were
many times when I felt really uncomfortable in my own skin.
 &HT;    ``I may have had celebrity quite quickly,'' she adds, ``but I've
had to work so hard to get respect and recognition. It's a bit like
Nicole Kidman _ she is one of the greatest actresses of her
generation, but she was never mentioned without reference to her
being Tom Cruise's wife. Until very recently, I was always
somebody's daughter or somebody's girlfriend.''
 &HT;    Paltrow's discomfort with her own success, Minghella says, shows
in her lack of confidence in her own ability and her deference to
other performers, such as ``Ripley'' co-star Cate Blanchett.
 &HT;    ``Gwyneth really underestimates herself as an actress,''
Minghella says. ``She was so in awe of Cate Blanchett, which is
deliciously ironic because everyone else knows what an incredible
actress and what a natural actress she is.''

DEER POPULATION ON RISE AS HUNTERS DWINDLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT BRAILE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Fewer deer were killed in Massachusetts' hunting season
this fall than in any of the past four years _ good news for the
animals but bad news for a state scrambling to rein in deer in the
suburbs that have been turning up everywhere, from playgrounds to
parking lots.
</P>
<P>
   Despite making the state's deer hunting season longer than it
has ever been since regulated hunts began in 1910, wildlife
officials say unofficial results show a decline of about 8 percent
in the deer killed this year, in part because fewer hunters are
taking to the woods.
</P>
<P>
   With so few deer killed this season, which ended Saturday, ``the
potential for continued growth in our suburban deer population is
tremendous,'' said Bill Davis, a biologist with the state Division
of Fisheries and Wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Hunters legally killed 8,564 deer from Oct. 11 through Dec. 18,
down from 9,311 last year. Meanwhile, the statewide deer population
stood at about 90,000 before this year's hunt, double what it was
in the late 1980s. And the number of hunters stalking the woods is
declining _ 87,679 hunting licenses were issued last year, down
from 129,733 in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Deer are turning up in forests and meadows where people like to
see them, but also in places where they don't, especially roads.
The division says it receives 400 to 600 reports a year of deer
struck by vehicles, up from about 200 five years ago. And it
believes that reported deer-vehicle collisions reflect only 10
percent to 20 percent of the actual number.
</P>
<P>
   Hunting has long been the primary way to control the deer
population. But hunters say hunting is on the wane, largely because
of a national decline in interest among young people and an aging
hunter population, and also for reasons specific to the state.
</P>
<P>
   A recent increase in state license fees has contributed to the
precipitous decline in hunters, who numbered 97,284 as recently as
1997.
</P>
<P>
   As the sprawl spreads out from cities, more land is being posted
as off-limits to hunters. The strong economy also works to keep
would-be hunters at work, with many opting to make a buck rather
than shoot one.
</P>
<P>
   But more than anything else, ``hunters are just getting older,
and kids nowadays are more involved in computer games and other
things,'' said John Kellstrand, a hunter and legislative agent for
the Massachusetts Sportsmen's Council.
</P>
<P>
   While the residential and commercial development spurred by a
surging economy is rarely viewed as good for nature, it is great
for deer. They roam the ``edges'' between forests and clearings,
the kind created when homes are built. They nibble on young plants
that thrive in fields where trees once grew. They savor the exotic
shrubbery surrounding many homes. ``We're really ringing the dinner
bell for deer,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Wolves and other natural predators are long gone. And in most
towns, deer cannot be shot within 500 feet of a home, if at all _
many towns prohibit or tightly restrict hunting. ``We've created de
facto refuges,'' said John McDonald, the division's deer project
leader.
</P>
<P>
   This year's archery season was extended by three weeks to a
total of six in Eastern Massachusetts, after previous moves to
lengthen the shotgun and primitive firearms seasons. The state has
also in recent years increased bag limits and doubled to 36,000 the
number of licenses issued for shooting antlerless deer, the females
that are key to herd size.
</P>
<P>
   As more people encounter deer on the highways or as freeloaders
dining on their shrubs, they are coming to view the animals as
bothersome rather than beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who may have once wanted to protect deer are now paying
to have them killed,'' McDonald said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hunters at this point are the only predators, except for
cars,'' said Paul Kress, a legislative agent for the Massachusetts
Wildlife Federation. He has lived in Carlisle for 30 years, where
he has seen deer go from being rare to common denizens of the
town's steadily developing landscape.
</P>
<P>
   He says the state can extend the season all it wants, but it
will have little effect in a part of Massachusetts where hunting is
virtually impossible anyway. In the end, he says, ``they just won't
be able to take enough deer.''

IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, VOTERS FOCUS ON LOCAL MATTERS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTSMOUTH, N.H. _ Katie Jarvis, a sixth-grade French teacher,
stood in the dusty school gymnasium here the other day, and with a
bit of trepidation, told Vice President Al Gore about ``a very
unfair property tax'' that could cost many people their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'm wondering, because the governor is endorsing you,
are you endorsing her property tax?'' asked Jarvis, whose own tax
bill in nearby Rye just went up $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Gore politely but firmly refused to be drawn into what has
become one of the longest-running, most controversial sagas in
state history _ how to equitably fund the schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have stayed completely out of that, not only for the reason
you might suspect, but also because I genuinely believe it is not
helpful to the people of New Hampshire . . . to mix it up in a
presidential campaign,'' Gore replied, leaving Jarvis disappointed,
annoyed, and planning to vote for Bill Bradley _ even though
Bradley shares Gore's view.
</P>
<P>
   ``All politics is local, and we are suffering in this part of
the state,'' Jarvis said later. ``How can you stand there and say
you're not going to get involved?''
</P>
<P>
   Here in the first primary state, the issues that voters are most
concerned with are not always lofty matters of national security or
domestic policy. Frequently, they are very local and very personal,
having little to do with the presidency and everything to do with
winning or losing the New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   At every opportunity, the voters of New Hampshire are asking the
presidential candidates what they think _ about their taxes, about
their jobs, and about their school budgets. And in many cases, the
candidates are trying to duck out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   On the seacoast and in the Lakes region, for example, a tax
revolt is brewing over efforts to finance public schools in a way
that satisfies the state Supreme Court. A legislative plan, signed
by Governor Jeanne Shaheen, would substantially raise taxes in
about 50 property-rich ``donor'' communities to equalize education
spending in poorer property towns in the rest of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, workers here on the seacoast are also worried that
another round of military base closings could jeopardize their jobs
at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. In vote-rich Nashua, about 350
jobs are dependent upon the Defense Department's contract with
Sanders, a Lockheed Martin Company, for six F-22 fighter jets _ a
source of controversy in Congress due to the cost. And throughout
the state, local towns struggle to pay for educating disabled
children without all of the federal special education dollars
promised by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   It is tempting for candidates to try to curry favor with primary
voters by genuflecting to local concerns, but some observers urge
that if they can avoid it, they should.
</P>
<P>
   ``The candidates should keep their comments to the issues in
which they will have a role to play if they are elected
president,'' said Bruce A. Berke, who ran the presidential campaign
here for Congressman John Kasich, an Ohio Republican. ``If they
weigh in on local issues, the downside is much greater than any
upside.''
</P>
<P>
   Often, for the candidates, choosing sides on a controversial
local issue can cause them to lose more votes than they might gain.
``Local issues are hard to deal with because you don't know all the
sides, you don't know where all the bodies are buried,'' said David
M. Carney, a longtime Republican strategist here.
</P>
<P>
   Another risk is for candidates to seem like they are pandering
by coming down on the popular side of a debate. That's what the
Bradley campaign says Gore is doing by favoring a military contract
for the F-22.
</P>
<P>
   The contract is worth as much as $3 billion over the next 13
years to the defense company. Sanders is responsible for the
electronic guts of the advanced tactical fighter, which is designed
to evade radar and fly at supersonic speeds.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley says he believes that the F-22 is an out-moded
weapon, premised on a world in which the Soviet Union is the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't support the F-22,'' he said. ``I think that we ought
to be spending on an overall defense strategy, with more on new
technology and less on new planes. I don't think it makes sense to
be paying $125 million for an F-22, given the way our national
security needs have evolved since the end of the Cold War.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, on the other hand, supports the fighter jet, and said he
didn't realize it was important to New Hampshire until after he
decided to back it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will admit that I was pleased to find out that it was a
local issue,'' Gore said. ``But my support of it was and is due to
its important role in protecting our national security.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president, along with GOP candidates Steve Forbes and
Texas Governor George W. Bush, cited the advanced technology of the
F-22 as reasons for continuing the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's vitally important that this country stay way ahead in air
capability of other countries,'' said Forbes. He said the
``flawed'' and ``bizarre'' defense procurement system is
responsible for the high cost of the project, and the jet should
not be grounded because of it.
</P>
<P>
   Republican John McCain, on the other hand, said he was not aware
that jobs in New Hampshire are at stake in the contract for the
F-22. The Arizona senator, who was a former Navy fighter pilot,
said he does not object to the concept of the jet, only the cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to make some hard decisions in the next
administration as to which fighter we're going to put our money
into,'' McCain said, calling for congressional hearings and
stringent cost caps.
</P>
<P>
   After Sanders, the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, which repairs and
refuels nuclear-powered submarines, is the second-largest recipient
of defense dollars in the state, with 3,648 workers and a $192
million payroll. Invariably, a shipyard employee will ask a
candidate if he will protect the jobs there from any future base
closings.
</P>
<P>
   None of the major candidates interviewed, with the exception of
Forbes, would make that promise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would neither seek to protect it, nor would I seek to close
it,'' said McCain. ``I would have the appointment of an objective
base closing commission, and they would make their decisions on
Portsmouth just as they would make their decisions on the five
military bases that are in the state of Arizona. The fact is, we
have to close bases, OK?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the shipyard has done a ``fantastic'' job, and any
future base-closing commission would conduct itself in a
nonpolitical manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make no promises, but I do understand the importance of the
Portsmouth Naval Shipyard,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said no one can expect to return to Cold War-era defense
budgets, and places like Portsmouth should be used for private, as
well as public, projects. ``I think there continues to be work for
Portsmouth, the question is how much, and what happens if you don't
have enough,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said it is hard to know what kinds of decisions the nation
will face in the future, ``but I frankly can't conceive of any
situation that would lead to the closing of the Portsmouth
shipyard. I can't conceive of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Only Forbes was adamant that he would keep the shipyard open and
operating.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a feeling in the post-Cold War world that we don't
need nuclear capability with our submarines,'' Forbes said. ``I
would beg to differ because while we don't have a Soviet foe right
now, if you don't keep up on that capability, others will catch
up.''
</P>
<P>
   While voters want to know what the candidates think of these and
other close-to-home subjects, most observers of the presidential
political scene here don't believe that they will make their
decision solely based on narrow self-interest. They said New
Hampshire voters take their responsibility seriously, and
understand that how they vote will influence the rest of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think in the final moment of Feb. 1, that someone's
going to say the reason I'm voting for Al Gore is he said he's
going to increase federal special education funding,'' said Dayton
Duncan, the author of ``Grassroots,'' a book about the 1988 New
Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, said Duncan, a candidate's knowledge of local
flashpoints amounts to old-fashioned common courtesy: ``It's a
signal to voters that `I'm a candidate who has at least taken the
time to acquaint myself with issues that are important to you here
in New Hampshire.' ''

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; This is how good a year it's been for money managers Geoffrey
Rehnert and Marc Wolpow:
</P>
<P>
   Their midsummer departure from their longtime professional home,
Bain Capital Inc., was complicated by the approaching deadline on
an option they held to acquire a 44 percent interest in a small
independent film distributor, Artisan Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnert and Wolpow, who were leaving to start their own
investment firm, quickly raised money to exercise the option and
completed the deal by July 9. Three days later, Artisan's latest
film opened, and ``The Blair Witch Project'' was on its way to
becoming a movie phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the summer wasn't bad, either.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnert and Wolpow, both managing directors at Bain, have pulled
together their firm, the Audax Group, sold a 20 percent stake in
the brand new business to three institutions for $50 million, and
raised $500 million for the first in a series of investment
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Like other money managers who dream about running their own
shop, they had to ask the question: If not now, when? With huge
amounts of investment money sloshing around and a long track
record, Rehnert and Wolpow didn't even have to market their first
buyout fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a time when there's a lot of money out there,'' Rehnert
said. ``In a different market, we would have had to be more
proactive.''
</P>
<P>
   What helped was the fact that three well-known institutions had
already agreed to buy stakes. Investments by the California Public
Employees Retirement System, Princeton University endowment
investor Nassau Capital LLC, and CIBC Capital Markets helped lift
the company's profile.
</P>
<P>
   The initial Audax fund drew institutions like SunAmerica,
FleetBoston Financial Group, and the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. Some of their old high-profile individual clients, such
as Staples Inc. chief executive Tom Stemberg, came along, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about people and their track records,'' Stemberg
said. ``If you look at how the business works, really these guys do
it on their own, whether it's in the context of Bain or in a
smaller group.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes Audax unusual in the private equity world is that it
wants to stick its fingers in so many ``alternative investment''
pies.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the buyout fund that will target midsize companies,
Audax expects to raise $75 million for an Internet-oriented venture
capital fund and another $250 million in a mezzanine investment
fund during the first quarter of next year. It's aiming for a $500
million collateralized bond obligation fund in the second quarter
and a hedge fund sometime in the second half of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The goal: build Audax up to a firm that manages $10 billion in a
full range of alternative investments.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the clientele is strictly institutions and very wealthy
individuals. Private equity firms like Bain or the Thomas H. Lee
Co. often become involved in many types of investments. But they
usually start from a business focused on one specialty, like
venture capital or leveraged buyouts, and evolve into other
investment categories over time.
</P>
<P>
   Those specialties are what made firms like Bain and Lee famous
in the first place. Our first thought: isn't a brand-new investment
company spreading itself too thinly with a handful of different
vehicles?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if we hadn't already done it before, there would be a
danger,'' Rehnert said. ``People who don't know us might say we're
biting off an awful lot. But we had a highly successful track
record at Bain, doing exactly what we're doing now. We're doing it
with the some of the same team and $50 million of operating capital
invested by top institutional investors.''
</P>
<P>
   He and Wolpow insist there are advantages to a family of
alternative investment funds, sharing market knowledge and a better
share of the flow of investment deals.
</P>
<P>
   Some see a marketing advantage in promoting a firm that can
offer one-stop shopping for alternative investments and many
different forms of private equity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's a powerful message to investors,'' said Steven
Galante, publisher of Private Equity Analyst, an industry
newsletter based in Wellesley.
</P>
<P>
   ``It strips away some of the mystique about these buyout and
venture firms. It goes straight to the heart of the matter; `We're
a money management firm, and what we do best is invest in private
companies.' ''
</P>
<P>

The Red Herring
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's column:
</P>
<P>
   The rankings of the most valuable public companies in
Massachusetts are being turned on their heads this year.
</P>
<P>
   Today's update: more of the same, only faster.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI Inc.'s spectacular stock run Tuesday, advancing 48 1/16 to
270 1/4, nearly moved the company ahead of FleetBoston Financial
Corp. as the third-most-valuable public company in the state.
CMGI's stock market value of $33.2 billion Tuesday was just $130
million shy of Fleet's market capitalization, according to
Bloomberg News.

COMPUTER SKELETONS IN OUR CLOSET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I think it was my mother who first remarked that there are
nearly as many computers as there are human beings in my household.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, I recently bought a 4-year-old used Macintosh PowerBook
5300cs, and I own a 6-year-old Macintosh Performa 6214. I also own
a museum piece, MS-DOS-powered 1989 Toshiba 1000SE laptop, which
lacks a hard drive. And in the basement there is a new,
Hewlett-Packard Pavilion computer, tailor-made for the modern child
to evade the tiresome copyright laws enacted for the benefit of
America's recording industry monopolies.
</P>
<P>
   Are my friends' homes like this? In fact, they are. Just up the
street, David O. copped to owning an iMac and a Toshiba laptop for
work, a broken NEC M/74 laptop, a 1989 Macintosh Plus, a 1994
Macintosh IIvx, and a PowerBook 170, ``sitting in the closet and
last used to write our speech at Ari's bar mitzvah,'' which took
place three years ago. Another friend still has his Radio Shack
TRS-80 (the famous ``Trash 80''), a once-cool Amiga, ``and a bunch
of printers'' gathering dust in his closets.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshirites garage their rusted-out cars on their front
lawns; suburbanites stash their old computers in their closets. Why
can't we let go? PC Data of Reston, Va., estimates that 14 million
new personal computers are sold into US homes each year, many of
them at Christmastime. And yet only 6 percent of home computers end
up in landfills. I suspect that's because few of us feel
comfortable leaving a $1,700 appliance (real value (EQ) 0) out on
the curb for the trash guys. So where will the orphans go to live?
</P>
<P>
   There is no obvious answer, because computers are unlike any
other appliance. If your 7-year-old car or television set is in
working order, you can pass it on to a friend or relative, or sell
it for peanuts. But while a 7-year-old computer may work, it can't
do anything anyone wants to do with a computer these days. It can't
surf the Internet very well, and as for downloading must-have MP3
songs, fuggedaboutit! My new-old PowerBook doesn't have a CD-ROM
drive; good luck getting software!
</P>
<P>
   But it gets worse. You can't even give your used computers away.
``Schools don't want them, except possibly to teach keyboard
skills,'' says Barry Cranmer, who runs a nonprofit Web site called
Share the Technology (libertynet.org/share). Schools are chary of
individual donors and want network-ready computers, which means
newer models. Cranmer tries to match computer donors with needy
recipients, but admits that it's a struggle. ``People still give us
8086's and 8088's'' _ Flintstones-era, MS-DOS machines powered by
caged squirrels.
</P>
<P>
   And they're not even giving very many of those; his site lists
only one computer available for donation in Massachusetts. Judging
from its Web site (www.wco.com/dale/crp.html), a similar venture,
the Computer Recycling Project, is more or less out of business. In
downtown Boston, the Nonprofit Computer Connection's Computer
Donation Program has likewise crashed.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, old computers have no value at all, except possibly
to be broken up into kitschy microchip ``jewelry.'' At the eBay Web
auction site, for instance, someone was recently trying to hawk a
``vintage'' Macintosh 128K that has the names of Steve Jobs, Steve
Wozniak, and other members of the original Mac development crew
etched on the inside of the case. The seller wants $50. The high
bid so far? $19.95.
</P>
<P>
   The perfect solution? Not for the first time, you've come to the
right place. You may want to join the MacQuarium movement, launched
in 1992 by Andy Ihnatko, a columnist for the defunct MacUser
magazine. More or less tongue in cheek, Ihnatko suggested that
over-the-hill Macs might make nice aquariums. His original,
easy-to-follow instructions are still available at
www.microserve.com/hac/interesting/macquarium/. Sample: ``Open the
case and remove the logic board, analog board, CRT yoke and
assembly, disk drive(s), hard drive, and frame. Discard.''
</P>
<P>
   Now there are MacQuariums everywhere! (See
www.alpine.k12.ut.us/ASD/Departments/Tech/Fish/Links.html) This
should give those people in New Hampshire something to think about.
A caveman diorama mounted in that rusted-out Buick sitting on the
lawn? Why not?

GREAT READS ON A POLITICIAN'S CAREER AND HIS ENVIRONMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you want to understand politics and media in the last third
of what the labelers are calling the American Century, help is at
hand.
</P>
<P>
   In your bookstore, virtual or otherwise, ``Edward M. Kennedy: A
Biography'' (William Morrow), a 692-page epic by Adam Clymer, is a
massive and meticulous account of the career of the storied
senator, a product of seven years' labor, interviews with 300
interested parties, and 21 face-offs with Theodore.
</P>
<P>
   This is a Cheops' Tome of a book, a great pyramid testament to a
politicial career that will have no sequel. There will not be
another biography of a US senator as thorough and detailed as this,
a Kennedy intimate assured me last weekend. No, because there will
not be another career like his in the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   The book's conclusion:
</P>
<P>
   ``He deserves recognition not just as the leading senator of his
time, but as one of the greats in its history, wise in the workings
of this singular institution, especially in its demand to be more
than partisan to accomplish much . . . A son of privilege, he has
always identified with the poor and the oppressed. The deaths and
tragedies around him would have led others to withdraw. He never
quits, but sails against the wind.''
</P>
<P>
   I buy that.
</P>
<P>
   Teddy went to Washington as a callow youth, kid brother of a
president, and did battle with the early-'60s status-quo that
included such repressive laws as the poll tax, which kept poor
people from voting.
</P>
<P>
   He's the legislative equivalent of a nuclear reactor, an
unquenchable volcano spouting practical concern for the Great
Unwashed. When he eulogized the six dead Worcester firefighters
Dec. 9, no figure in public life could have been as persuasive.
Because we all know Teddy's story and how many caskets he's prayed
over.
</P>
<P>
   Clymer, The New York Times's most senior Washington
correspondent, recounts a career that will not be duplicated
because of the changes in politics and government we've witnessed
since JFK's death.
</P>
<P>
   Just how the biz changed is the theme of ``No Way to Pick a
President'' (Farrar, Straus and Giroux), the story of how the
``money-driven technocracy'' of pollsters, consultants,
election-law lawyers, and spin doctors has hijacked our elections
and made ventriloquist's dummies of our victors.
</P>
<P>
   This, the 16th political book by 40-year veteran reporter Jules
Witcover, the shy half of the Germond-Witcover columnist tag-team,
documents in 303 pages how presidential elections changed _ for the
worse _ between Eisenhower's in 1952 and the one we are suffering
through now. Where Clymer explains what happened in public policy,
Witcover traces the downward spiral of the presidential-picking
process.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, I've known both authors for decades, and can
vouch for their bona fides. Like Witcover's wisecracking partner,
Jack Germond, whose current hard-cover offering, ``Fat Man in a
Middle Seat: 40 Years of Covering Politics'' (Random House, 284
pp.) I touted in a recent column, Clymer and Witcover are members
in good standing of the Old Brigade of veteran journalists whose
fairness and judgment are widely accepted by those in the trade.
</P>
<P>
   In an era of books edited in half-arsed fashion and flogged by
TV personalities who possibly don't know any better, this should
count for something, and maybe even does. As Bob Dole would say,
``Whatever . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Witcover's poster boy for consultants-gone-berserk is the
ubiquitous Dick Morris, the brainy but conscienceless consultant
who has sold candidacies as diverse as Bill Clinton, Trent Lott,
and Bill Weld.
</P>
<P>
   Morris, who now cluck-clucks about Clinton's failings for Rupert
Murdoch's Fox television network, told Witcover he charged the
Clinton campaign about $1.5 million for all the advice on
``triangulation'' and moving-to-the-center he sold Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   It was Clinton's lust for the huge sums of money Morris was
spending on TV ads and his fees that triggered the Lincoln Bedroom
sleepovers and Buddhist Nun fund-raisers that led to the White
House fund-raising scandals investigated loudly but ineffectually
by GOP critics these past three years.
</P>
<P>
   The low point of negative campaign tactics, Witcover attests,
was the defeat of Michael Dukakis by George Bush the Elder. ``That
1988 campaign marked the greatest triumph yet of negative
television advertising concocted by hired guns.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Bush Senior relying on wiseguys like Roger Ailes, the
adman who packaged Nixon's victory in 1968 and now the chief
alchemist of Murdoch's Fox News network, and the late Lee Atwater,
whose embrace of below-the-belt tactics was legendary.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the descent of the news biz into toxic tabloid
territory is documented in ``Warp Speed: America in the Age of
Mixed Media'' (Century Foundation, 193 pp.) by Harvard's Bill
Kovach and Tom Rosenstiel. The subtitle could be ``mixed-up
media,'' for all the grim failures, ethical and judgmental,
documented in this account of the slide to the slime.

   The first trial to test whether gene therapy can slow the
progress of Alzheimer's disease has been given the go-ahead. In
theory the same technique could be used to enhance the cognitive
ability of people who aren't suffering from dementia.
</P>
<P>
   Alzheimer's is the most common cause of dementia in older
people, killing brain cells called cholinergic neurons. As the
number of elderly people in developed nations increases,
Alzheimer's is exacting an ever more devastating toll, so finding
effective ways to treat it is a top priority.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers led by Mark Tuszynski of the University of
California, San Diego, are betting that a substance called nerve
growth factor will stave off dementia not only by preventing the
death of cholinergenic neurons, but also by promoting new
connections between the cells.
</P>
<P>
   A decade of experiments on rodents and primates shows that NGF
helps protect cholinergic neurons and can reverse memory loss. In
September, for instance, Tuszynski's team showed that NGF gene
therapy could reverse age-related neural degeneration in rhesus
monkeys, with the genes remaining active for at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before Christmas, the National Institutes of Health's
Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee cleared an initial safety study
that will involve eight people with early Alzheimer's disease who
can understand and consent to the procedure. First, the researchers
will take cells called fibroblasts from the patients' skin and
genetically engineer them to produce NGF by adding extra copies of
the gene using a mouse leukemia virus modified to ensure that it
shouldn't trigger cancer. Then they will inject the NGF-producing
cells into the base of the patients' forebrains.
</P>
<P>
   Although the committee agreed that the virus that will be used
to deliver the NGF gene poses little risk, one member did question
the growth factor itself. Wilma Friedman of Columbia University in
New York noted that NGF can kill brain cells that carry a receptor
called p75 but not another called trk. However, Tuszynski points
out that cells in the basal forebrain seem to have both receptors.
</P>
<P>
   The main goal of the trial is to assess the maximum dose of
modified cells that can be safely injected. But Tuszynski will also
look to see if the disease progresses more slowly than normal. ``We
think there is a direct potential for benefit,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers have had to resort to gene therapy because NGF
injected into the blood stream doesn't readily cross the
blood-brain barrier. However, any genetic technique that affects
brain function has the potential to generate controversy. Earlier
this year, for instance, when Joe Tsien and his colleagues at
Princeton University in New Jersey created transgenic mice with
improved memories by boosting levels of the gene for a receptor on
the surface of brain cells called NMDA, there was widespread
speculation about using the human version of the gene to engineer
``supersmart'' people.
</P>
<P>
   Tuszynski plays down these fears. ``Most of these studies that
demonstrate enhanced brain function with growth factors or other
agents, like Tsien's, have been done to understand what the normal,
physiological role of a gene is,'' he says. Using similar
techniques to treat debilitating diseases such as Alzheimer's
doesn't mean that anyone is suggesting that they should be used to
improve normal human cognitive function, Tuszynski stresses.
</P>
<P>
   However, Eric Juengst, a bioethicist at Case Western Reserve
University in Cleveland, says that many gene therapies designed to
treat disease also have potential for genetically enhancing healthy
people. ``This just highlights a problem that the committee will
see increasingly,'' he says. &QL;

   We've heard their names often these past few weeks: Babe
Didrickson Zaharias, Jackie Joyner-Kersee, Billie Jean King,
Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert, Sonja Henie. All indisputably
changed not only the face of women's sports but also the attitudes
of those who watched it happen; beacons of athleticism and courage,
each deserves all the end-of-century attention she is finally
getting, and more.
</P>
<P>
   But there are so many others. Some are women who stood up and
proclaimed themselves athletes despite being told to sit back down;
others are women who proclaimed not a thing, but simply did what
they needed to do despite the odds, the obstacles, the ridicule.
Many are world champions or Olympic gold medalists; others have
names that may not even ring a bell. Together, they compose not a
Top 10, but merely a sampling of fearlessness and intregrity that
cannot go unheralded in this season of bests and mosts and
greatests.
</P>
<P>
   In alphabetical order:
</P>
<P>
   --Michelle Akers, who struggled through chronic fatigue syndrome
ferociously to help the US women's soccer team win last summer's
World Cup, then quietly went home to Florida to rest and spread the
word of God.
</P>
<P>
   --Ernestine Bayer, the Stratham, N.H., nonagenarian often
recognized as the matriarch of women's rowing in America. It took
her 10 years from the time she got married in 1928 to persuade her
skeptical husband (``Women don't row'') to let her take a boat out
on the Schuylkill River; within a year she would start the first
women's rowing organization in the country.
</P>
<P>
   --Hassiba Bourlmerka, the first African woman to win a world
title and the first Algerian to win an Olympic gold medal (1500
meters, 1992). Before her triumph in Barcelona she often had to
dodge rocks thrown at her on training runs; afterward she reported
receiving death threats from Islamic militants. Just this June, she
caused a furor when she refused to back down, in front of an
International Olympic Committee panel, from accusations against
Mexico of gender discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   --Teresa Edwards, the 35-year-old founding member of the
American Basketball League who is on her way to becoming a
five-time Olympian. After turning down an offer from the WNBA after
the ABL folded because she was insulted by its rookie salary offer,
one of the most respected women to ever pick up a basketball was on
her way to play in Turkey before USA Basketball called asking her
to rejoin the national team.
</P>
<P>
   --Ludmila Engquist, the Russian-born hurdler competing for
Sweden who inspired countless women when she won a bronze medal at
last summer's World Championships while undergoing chemotherapy
treatments for breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   --Chris Ernst, captain of Yale's varsity women's crew in 1976
who, along with her teammates, stripped naked (``These are the
bodies Yale is exploiting'') in an administrator's office to
protest the conditions under which they were forced to practice.
The conditions improved. Ernst is now a plumber living in
Brookline, and subject of the documentary ``A Hero for Daisy.''
</P>
<P>
   --Cammi Granato, whose graceful skating and gracious manner made
it OK for thousands of young girls to play ice hockey without
having to cut their hair and sign up as boys, as many of her 1998
Olympic gold medal teammates had to do when they were young.
</P>
<P>
   --Tegla Loroupe, the marathon world-record holder from Kenya who
spoke out against her federation's neglect of women on the day she
won her first New York Marathon in 1994 and who hasn't stopped yet.
</P>
<P>
   --Kathrine Switzer, in 1967 the first woman to officially run
the Boston Marathon. Without Switzer's determination and lobbying,
there might never have been a women's marathon in the 1984 Olympics
for Joan Benoit Samuelson to win.
</P>
<P>
   --Louise Rossetti, Phil Campbell, the late Ruth Rothfarb, and
every other recreational athlete who's still going strong in her
70s and 80s and thereby expanding the perception of what it means
to age gracefully.

LET BLEDSOE BE HEARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Many things have been muttered about the
problems of the New England Patriots' offense the past six weeks
and few have been printable. Yet one thing may have been missed in
all the questioning.
</P>
<P>
   The solution, at least in part, may have been missed.
</P>
<P>
   Men who are paid hundreds of thousands of dollars by Robert
Kraft have not yet found the solution, yet it lies on these pages,
you say with skepticism? Perhaps it does, and these days ``perhaps
it does'' would be a step up from where the Patriots' offense
squats at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   To refresh your memory, after a 6-2 start in which their offense
was terrorizing the NFL, the Patriots have lost five of six, been
eliminated from the playoff race, and scored only seven touchdowns.
Worse, quarterback Drew Bledsoe has been under siege and played
like it.
</P>
<P>
   Davy Crockett was not on the offensive at the Alamo. General
Custer was not on the offensive at the Little Big Horn. So who can
blame Bledsoe for not being on the offensive against NFL defenses
that are flattening him?
</P>
<P>
   In the first eight games, Bledsoe was sacked only 22 times,
threw just four interceptions, delivered 22 touchdown passes, and
was 164 of 271, a completion rate of 60.5 percent. In the last six,
defenses have taken a different approach, and New England has not
answered. Beginning with the Jets game, the Patriots' receivers
have been jammed at the line to take away the intermediate routes
Ernie Zampese's offense relies on, forcing Bledsoe to go deep or
dump the ball short, which is not his mindset or Zampese's.
</P>
<P>
   Defenses have repeatedly attacked with blitzes, particularly
zone blitzes, against New England's scant protection, a scheme that
often results in not enough blockers to cover the number of
rushers, hence the talk of Bledsoe being responsible for one of
those rushers.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is he should be able to get the ball away quickly
enough to an open man to beat the blitz. That works when the
coverage is not as aggressive at the line as it has been, but
lately Bledsoe's receivers have not had time to work free before
the pocket begins to break down, resulting in three predictable
things: increased sacks, increased interceptions, and a quarterback
who feels like Jake LaMotta in the 15th round against Sugar Ray
Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   During this terrible collapse, Bledsoe's numbers have slipped in
ways that seem almost inexplicable until you hear someone like
veteran tackle Bruce Armstrong talk of coming to the line of
scrimmage after a play has been called ``with your fingers
crossed.'' The numbers not only bear this out, they point to a
solution if Zampese and coach Pete Carroll will embrace it.
</P>
<P>
   As Armstrong was saying as diplomatically as possible, plays are
being called that too often are doomed before the snap, and Bledsoe
is not free to change them. In the Patriot offense, Bledsoe is not
allowed to check off or audible except in a few specific
situations. The theory is he can beat the defense with the play
called, which was working fine until the Jets' Bill Belichick came
up with new approaches that checkmated Zampese's.
</P>
<P>
   There are many reasons for that, and the absence of a running
game and the reduced effectiveness of the tight end position, which
is critical in Zampese's scheme, are two big ones. Because of those
weaknesses, Bledsoe needs the freedom to make his own play
selection when he fears Zampese's one is doomed, and the proof of
that is what he has done without that freedom and what has resulted
the few times he's had it.
</P>
<P>
   During this stretch that has knocked New England out of playoff
contention, Bledsoe has gone 116 of 222 for 1,462 yards (a reduced
completion rate of 52.3 percent) with five touchdown passes, 16
interceptions, and 25 sacks. He has silently gone down with the
ship, refusing to question his coaches, criticize receivers who
haven't gotten open, or rip his linemen.
</P>
<P>
   But the source of the problem and perhaps its solution may be
buried amid the rubble: Of New England's seven miserly touchdowns
during this drought, five have come on pass plays with Bledose in
the shotgun running the two-minute offense.
</P>
<P>
   Only then is he free to audibilize or check off to get his
offense out of problems posed at the line of scrimmage after he
sees the defense, and only then does he have the freedom to make
his own play selections.
</P>
<P>
   Five of seven touchdowns in a two-minute situation says
something, and not simply that defenses are laying back, because
three of those scoring passes were for 68, 45, and 31 yards to
three receivers (Shawn Jefferson, Terry Glenn, and Troy Brown), all
of whom beat coverages deep.
</P>
<P>
   What it seems to say is that it's time to unleash not only the
arm of Bledsoe but also his mind. As one offensive player, who
chose anonymity for obvious reasons, put it, ``It's totally
(expletive) ridiculous to have a guy like Bledsoe as quarterback
and not have an audible system. There are five or 10 times a game
he could get us out of a bad play or an average play into a bigger
one, but we don't even have that capability.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have real trouble with zone blitzes because of that.
They're jamming our receivers in press coverage, and the routes we
have called to beat it take time to develop. The receivers don't
have the time or the freedom to get open because they can't just
run to a spot and turn around now. So Bledsoe is holding the ball
longer, and that's resulting in hits on him or the ball going out
to guys who are still covered.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say all the blame lies with Zampese. In the
Eagles debacle, for example, Zampese called at least four plays
that should have been touchdowns. Because of poor execution, none
was.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious was when Glenn dropped a pass in the end zone
when he was wide open.
</P>
<P>
   The second was when Zampese called a play that got Jefferson
open behind the defense, but Jefferson became slightly disoriented
as he caught the ball and was unsure of where he was on the field.
He ran out of bounds instead of into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   The third came with Jefferson open on a corner route behind the
defense. Bledsoe saw him, but just as he went to throw, his
protection broke down a second too early, and he was hit in the
chest by William Thomas as he released the ball. As a result, the
ball looked more like a punt than a pass when it fell into the
hands of Al Harris at the 5-yard line, 10 yards short of an open
Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   The last was on a slant route to Glenn against a blitz. He beat
the coverage, but the ball didn't get there in stride, for which
Bledsoe carries the blame.
</P>
<P>
   Four plays that should have been 6 points each time resulted in
none, not because of the scheme but because of execution, which
Bledsoe acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bad as it was, and it was pretty bad, the plays were there for
us,'' Bledsoe said Tuesday. ``Watching that thing was bad. It
didn't look good, but we had four touchdowns we just didn't get.
That wasn't coaching. That was us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a finesse team, especially on offense. We have to make
those plays. That's how we hurt teams. We don't play with that real
attitude that we'll beat you up. We burn people in those situations
so they had to play off us, but we don't pound people. Maybe that's
my fault. I'm pretty laid-back. Maybe the team takes on my
personality.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet if he could change plays he knows will not work before the
snap or is given the freedom to call more of his own as the game
moves along, it is likely the Patriots would hit more of those
plays that burn defenses and hence Bledsoe wouldn't seem so
laid-back. The personality of his team might once again resemble
that of the 6-2 squad. How about that possibility being considered
instead of simplistic nonsense such as the ``Put Michael Bishop in
the game, man'' that talk radio denizens have adopted?
</P>
<P>
   It is time for a 60-minute game to be played in two-minute
intervals for now. It is time for Bledsoe to be given the freedom
to change the play at the line and go with what he believes might
work rather than have Armstrong trying to pass-block with fingers
crossed.
</P>
<P>
   It is no accident that defenses began to attack the Patriots
differently after their fast start. It's also no accident that the
times he has beaten those defenses for touchdowns, it's been in
two-minute situations, where he was running the team and adjusting
the call.
</P>
<P>
   The current approach is an indictment not of Zampese's play-
calling but of a system that refuses to allow room for adjustment
or input from the person most involved _ the quarterback. No one is
right all the time, as the present 1-5 collapse makes clear.
</P>
<P>
   Are the handcuffs on Bledsoe's mind the only problem? No. Has he
made some ill-conceived throws? Admittedly so. But would the
offense be better served and more productive working with more of a
two-minute philosophy in which the quarterback has more direct
control of the play calling, at least until defenses back off their
aggressive assaults on him?
</P>
<P>
   Five of seven touchdowns the last six games fairly screams that
out.

   WASHINGTON _ For some, it's the fear of terrorism. Many others
are unwilling to shell out the hundreds or even thousands of
dollars demanded for New Year's Eve extravaganzas. And still others
do not want to party until they know the Y2K bugs have been stamped
out.
</P>
<P>
   The result is the same: Faced with the only opportunity of our
lifetimes to celebrate the turning of a millennium, Americans are
planning to stay home in droves.
</P>
<P>
   They are motivated by the combination of hype and hysteria, a
whole year saturated with best-of-the-century lists, global
hand-wringing over the Y2K computer bug and potential terrorist
attacks, rhinestone-studded 2000 mementos for sale, and the extra
pressure to do something extra special for this particular New
Year.
</P>
<P>
   It is all just too much, say many who plan to miss the blowout
party scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is the anti-New Year's Eve,'' said Lisa Salvati, a
36-year-old producer in Manhattan. Despite living in a favorite New
Year's Eve party venue, Salvati says she will spend the evening in
quiet reflection with her parents.
</P>
<P>
   Salvati will not be alone. This year, 61 percent of Americans
will stay home this New Year's Eve, compared to the 66 percent who
typically stay home, according to an ABC poll released two weeks
ago. The figure was 54 percent in August, indicating a
couch-sitting trend as the year 2000 approaches.
</P>
<P>
   The Jacob K. Javits Center in New York had to cancel its ``Party
of The Century,'' where the likes of Aretha Franklin and Sting were
set to perform, because the tickets weren't selling. An expensive
charity event in Washington was also canceled because of poor
ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
   While the cheaper tickets (those costing $75) to Billy Joel's
New Year's Eve performance in Madison Square Garden have been sold
out, the $999 tickets are still available.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people got turned off by the big hoopla and the
expense,'' said Brad Johnson, a lawyer in Washington. ``I was
thinking at one point of going to Paris, but I think I'm just going
to hang out here.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, some revelers are prepared to dump massive amounts
of cash on the evening; a Florida couple is spending $100,000 for
an ultra-swanky celebration at Boston's Ritz-Carlton hotel. Others
are flying to Egypt for a New Year's celebration at the Pyramids, a
fete that costs $1,999 inclusive.
</P>
<P>
   But around the globe, event planners and travel agents are
finding ticket sales lagging.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just really one of the victims of what's going on in
the whole world, not just in our country,'' said Leslie Hayes of
Virginia-based Hayes &AMP; Associates, which planned _ and was forced
to cancel _ the ``America's New Millenium'' charity event in
downtown Washington. ``People just aren't going out.''
</P>
<P>
   The event, known as the Party With a Purpose, was to raise $1
million for 20 local charities by charging $500 to $2,000 a ticket
for a buffet meal, drinks, and a peformance by Roger Daltrey of The
Who.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very disappointed,'' said Craig Shniderman of Food for
Friends, which delivers meals to AIDS patients. But Shniderman said
he had an inkling the party wasn't selling well when he got a call
at home from a telemarketer peddling tickets to the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime they're telemarketing tickets that are $500 to $2,000
apiece, you know the event's in trouble,'' Shniderman said.
</P>
<P>
   Special millennium packages for Caribbean cruises are going for
as little as half their original cost, though the prices were
jacked up to begin with, said Traci Irvine of Atlanta-based Travel
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``People weren't willing to pay $3,000 for a five-day cruise,''
and the cruise liners vastly overestimated how much of a premium
people would pay for a millennial package, Irvine said.
</P>
<P>
   The Fiji Visitors Bureau is promoting packages to the island of
Taveuni, which some travelers wrongly believe is crossed by the
International Dateline (it's just very near), said Darrell Einarson
of Fiji Travel in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   But ``people are backing out'' of the trip, Einarson said.
``Huge mobs of people put down deposits, thousands of dollars, and
are not going to show,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   People don't generally give a reason for canceling, he said, but
Einarson and others said the increasing focus on the possibility of
terrorism is probably a factor.
</P>
<P>
   The US State Department has warned Americans that terrorists
might strike at midnight, and that US citizens should be on alert
at large gatherings here and abroad as the millennium changes.
</P>
<P>
   The concern was heightened by the recent arrest near Seattle of
an Algerian man, who authorities said was carrying explosives, and
the arrest Sunday of another Algerian man in Vermont. Both men
allegedly tried to enter the country from Canada with falsified
documents.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, NBC employees are being issued special building
passes for the the period around New Year's, because Rockefeller
Center could be a target, a network employee said.
</P>
<P>
   Even without threats of violence, some said, the logistics for
this New Year's Eve are just too much trouble. Baby-sitters are
hard to come by, and cabs are likely to be scarce. One New York
woman said she feared not riots in the streets, but a power outage.
What Manhattan high-rise resident wants to risk having to climb 22
flights of stairs if the elevators are not running?
</P>
<P>
   Those who do want to celebrate are tending toward smaller, less
expensive parties or large, free events, planners say.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the national prosperity, ``people aren't willing to blow
money on New Year's,'' said New Yorker Christian Spears, a
26-year-old stock trader. So Spears and his friends in the
financial-services industry are sponsoring a $250-a-head party at
Manhattan's Metropolitan Pavillion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's relatively affordable'' for the young professionals, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton are hosting a
dinner for 300 people and a reception for 800.
</P>
<P>
   Those who didn't get an invitation can still celebrate the
millennium with the Clintons. ``America's Millennium'' in
Washington is free and is expected to draw many thousands of
people. Highlighting the event will be musical performances on the
National Mall, and a short Steven Spielberg film narrated by the
president.
</P>
<P>
   But many aren't venturing out at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're kind of hunkering down,'' said Daphne Atkeson, a
46-year-old novelist in Phoenix. ``I'm going to have to set the
clock for 11:30 just to be awake at midnight.''

PHILLIPS KNOWS THE RUNDOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wade Phillips knows the feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was coaching in Denver (1994) and we didn't have a running
game,'' said the Buffalo Bills coach. ``They were all over John
Elway. He was getting chased every play. They knew we couldn't run,
and they came after John. We start out losing four in a row . . .''
</P>
<P>
   And at the end of the year, Phillips took the fall. He was the
head coach in Denver for two years, reached the playoffs the first
season and was fired the next, when his team finished 7-9.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is trying to bring the Bills to the playoffs, and he sees
some similarities in watching game film of the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   ``New England hasn't been able to run the ball, so teams are
just coming after (Drew) Bledsoe,'' he said. ``They (the Patriots)
are putting it all on him. It's hard for anyone to do. He's still a
hell of a quarterback, and they've still got a lot of talented
guys. But when you can't run the ball, it's hard to score points.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Bills are tearing it up on offense. Even though
they have won five of their last seven games, they are still
struggling to score. Last Sunday night they beat the Cardinals in
Arizona, 31-21, but the last touchdown came on a return of an
onside kick. And in the three previous games, they had scored 7,
17, and 17. Why? Because their top runner, Antowain Smith, has been
hobbled by injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each week we thought he was going to play,'' said Phillips.
``He'd practice during the week, but in the warmup before the game,
he couldn't go. It messed us up some on offense. So last week, we
just decided that no matter what, Jonathan Linton was going to be
our guy, and we ran the ball well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bills run the ball no matter what. They average 33 runs per
game, even though their average per carry is 3.9. Both Linton (167
carries, 595 yards) and Smith (162-583) average 3.6 yards per
carry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy that has run well for us is (Doug) Flutie,'' said
Phillips. ``Teams have started to play more man-to-man defense
against him this year, and that leaves him some openings in the
running game. He's run the ball something like 80 times and made
some good yardage.''
</P>
<P>
   Flutie is averaging 5.3 yards per game (82 rushes, 432 yards).
He has not thrown the ball as well as he did last season because
opposing defenses have a better read on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago we had success in the spread offense,'' said
Phillips. ``Doug was very good in that set. But like it always
happens, the defenses started to adjust to it. Now when a team
spreads out (like New England), they're going to come after the
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're lucky that Doug can run the ball the way he can, so we
can hurt them in those situations. When they blitz like that, a lot
of times they're playing man-to-man downfield. So if Doug can beat
the rush, he can make some first downs for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way it is in this business. Someone will come up
with an offense that is hard to stop. Like the run and shoot. When
it first started to have success in the league, everyone starts to
say, `Why don't all teams do that?' Then, after a couple of years,
defensive coaches figured out a way to attack. Soon the run and
shoot wasn't a big deal anymore. Now they have figured out how to
attack the spread offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``This edge from offense to defense goes back and forth all the
time in this league. The offense had the edge for awhile. Now I
think it is shifting back to defense. It's very hard to score
points consistently right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bills need this game Sunday. They are in a wild playoff
chase in the AFC. But if they do get in, the Bills could easily be
the surprise team.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Smith said two weeks ago that this is the best Buffalo
defense he has ever played with. They are a veteran playoff team
with the ability to win on the road. That will help if Smith comes
back to join Linton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this will be the week we get him back,'' said
Phillips.

PRISONERS GET A BOOK ON STARTING A NEW CHAPTER

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Instead of just shaving cream and toothpaste in their
stockings this year, inmates at the Suffolk County prison will get
a surprise: a book urging them to find freedom and forgiveness
behind bars through meditation, letting go of their anger, and
getting in touch with the pain they experienced as children.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff Richard J. Rouse is giving out 1,750 copies of the thick
paperback, ``Houses of Healing,'' hoping it will show the convicts
a way to reflect on their crimes and turn their lives around.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we'd give them something that could help develop
their consciences,'' Rouse explained. ``They're doing time anyway.
Instead of watching ``Jerry Springer,'' they can try something more
profound, like learning who they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Written by psychotherapist Robin Casarjian, ``Houses of
Healing'' has struck a chord with many prisoners and those who work
with them.
</P>
<P>
   A nonprofit group founded by Casarjian has sent about 40,000
copies to libraries in the nation's federal, state, and local
prisons, and to thousands of individual inmates. The book is free
to anyone who cannot afford an $8 donation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Houses of Healing'' asks prisoners to use their incarceration
as a period of spiritual reflection in order to gain a new
awareness of themselves and greater self-respect.
</P>
<P>
   Casarjian argues that acknowledging guilt and remorse and facing
up to the impact of their crimes can help inmates create a more
positive future, and turn the prison into a house of healing.
</P>
<P>
   She tells prisoners their lives are worth reforming _ even if
they have committed horrific crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite honestly, some of the most thoughtful, mature,
compassionate people I have ever met are people in prison doing
life and long-term sentences,'' she writes.
</P>
<P>
   For the rough-hewn Rouse, who knows some of the inmates
personally, Casarjian's approach _ with its emphasis on getting in
touch with the wounded inner child, self-forgiveness, and
self-esteem _ is a bit of a stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not hugging inmates every day or anything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rouse said a pilot program Casarjian launched about two
years ago seems to have caught on with prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened to convicted assailant Henry Flynn after he
attended one of Casarjian's workshops while he was at MCI-Concord
about three years ago and then read her book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went from being an extremely depressed person to a guy who
felt free inside the walls of a prison,'' he said. He could
meditate or pray or cry without embarrassment. He was no longer
embittered by memories of abuse he suffered as a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was locked up and I felt totally free,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The population Rouse hopes to reach is made up of prisoners
convicted of less serious crimes, and all of them will be released
within two and a half years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to do whatever we can to get a better product coming
out the door,'' Rouse said.
</P>
<P>
   The Christmas presents, costing a total of about $12,000, are
being paid for by private donations and revenues from the sale of
products and services to inmates. No taxpayers' money is involved.
</P>
<P>
   Casarjian, 51, began her prison work in 1988. She was teaching
stress management and holistic health care in a range of corporate,
medical, and religious settings, ``talking to anyone who would give
me a pulpit,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   One day an addiction counselor asked her to address a group at
MCI-Gardner, a medium-security prison for men. Casarjian agreed,
expecting only a few inmates to attend. She was deeply moved when
120 of them appeared, and responded enthusiastically.
</P>
<P>
   She was invited to return, this time for an extended course, and
by the second week she knew she had found her calling.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had this hunger to make meaning out of their experiences
and turn their lives around,'' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Casarjian has given hundreds of workshops at prisons
around the country. To reach a larger audience than she could
address in person, in 1992 she formed the National Emotional
Literacy Project for Prisoners, which published ``Houses of
Healing'' three years later.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of Casarjian's approach is the conviction that
every human being has a core of goodness and sanity. But too often
this gets obscured by destructive or unhealthy
``sub-personalities'' formed to protect the self from childhood
wounds, such as violence, abuse, neglect.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, many inmates have learned ``to look at the
lampshade, instead of the light'' in themselves and others, she
says.
</P>
<P>
   She uses meditation and other stress reduction techniques, as
well as exercises designed to help probe the past, to help them see
their inner worth, forgive those who wounded them, accept
responsibility for their crimes, and move on in more constructive
ways.
</P>
<P>
   The key, she says, is forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   As long as someone holds on to resentment, ``it's like a
handcuff binding them to the person who did the hurting,'' she
says. ``And there's a level of healing and spiritual growth that
never happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Rouse and Casarjian acknowledge that this approach won't reach
everyone. But Casarjian and others who have worked with her say
they have seen scores of lives uplifted and transformed by this
work.
</P>
<P>
   Flynn, 43, said he had been in trouble with the law since age 9
for drinking, drug use, assaults, and armed robberies.
</P>
<P>
   When he was sent to MCI-Concord four years ago on assault and
battery charges, he was so depressed he didn't shower or talk to
anyone for weeks. A friend persuaded him to attend one of
Casarjian's workshops, which he wanted to do ``only slightly more
than I wanted to die,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said she helped him see the effects of physical and mental
abuse he suffered while young, see how afraid he was of the
hard-core criminals who terrorized his neighborhood, see how he
acted just like they did out of fear and for self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, he said, he began to see his own light.
</P>
<P>
   Now Flynn is out of jail, running a successful home improvement
business, and taking care of his family, he and others said. He
attributes the dramatic changes in his life to the approach he
learned in the pages of Casarjian's book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call it a life-saving technique,'' he said.

PENSION PLANS, RETIREES AGITATE FOR A BIGGER CUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Marty Quinn had always thought of himself as a good and loyal
employee. For 31 years, he installed and repaired telephone wires,
rarely missing a day's work, until his retirement from Bell
Atlantic Corp. in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But now, the 59-year-old retiree is on the warpath.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn claims the pensions he and other Bell Altantic Corp.
retirees are receiving lack a key element: annual cost-of-living
increases to offset inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, as far back as I can trace, we never went more
than three years without an increase in our pensions,'' said Quinn,
president of the retiree club at the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers, Local 2222. ``But next month, it will be nine
years.''
</P>
<P>
   After protesting changes in health care and insurance benefits,
retirees at some of the nation's biggest companies are taking a
closer look at their pension payments, and many aren't happy.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one of the biggest issues among corporate America's
retirees today is pension plan ``stuffing,'' or overfunding. This
occurs when pension funds, fueled by a booming stock market, are
fattened by lucrative investments. A boost for retirees? Not
really, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although many of the funds are overfunded and there is plenty
of money available to make regular adjustments to retirees,
companies also have an institutional interest in not increasing
benefits,'' said Karen Ferguson, director of the Pension Rights
Center in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The reason? The excess funds in bulging pension plans can be
reported as a credit toward income, resulting in higher earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal reported in June that several companies
have benefitted from a little-known accounting rule that permits
such income credits in cases in which a company's pension assets
exceed the pension fund's current costs. The newspaper reported
that ``Bell Atlantic's plan produced a $627 million pretax credit
for the firm's 1998 income statement; GTE Corp. gained a $473
million pretax credit, while Caterpillar Inc. scored a $183 million
credit.''
</P>
<P>
   No wonder retirees are angry.
</P>
<P>
   The Coalition for Retirement Security, a retiree advocacy group
in Springfield with a million members nationwide, says it will meet
next month in Washington, D.C., to encourage Congress to require
that employers share the billions accruing in fat corporate pension
funds.
</P>
<P>
   The group may not have much luck, though.
</P>
<P>
   Pension rights experts say the group would be better off
lobbying the Securities and Exchange Commission, since its job is
to make sure corporate financial statements reflect reality. If
there is enough of a hue and cry, the SEC could try to convince the
Financial Accounting Standards Board to alter the accounting rule
by asking companies to add a footnote to their financial
statements, telling investors exactly how much of their reported
income includes pension fund surpluses. Congress could also request
that the accounting standards board update its rule, which went
into effect in 1987 for big companies.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, busloads of Bell Atlantic retirees demonstrated
outside company offices in downtown Boston. The group wants Bell
Atlantic to institute regular cost-of-living increases by tapping
into the nearly $9 billion surplus in the pension fund.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials say concerns about pensions and health benefits
will likely be the central focus of negotiations next year when
Bell Atlantic's two unions, the Communications Workers of America
and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, begin
contract talks.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Steve Marcus said Bell Atlantic has done all it could
to help workers who retired 30 or 40 years ago. ``The company has
made a decision to target its resources toward retirees who retired
many years ago, or well before the company made improvements in its
pension benefits and savings plan,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Marcus said, Bell Atlantic authorized an increase
that will hike the pensions of workers with 30 or more years on the
job by at least 75 percent over three years. This means workers
collecting the monthly minimum of $400 will see their pensions rise
to $700 per month by July 2001.
</P>
<P>
   As for more recent retirees, Marcus said, ``You really have to
look at the entire package of benefits that Bell Atlantic provides,
including the pension, and a voluntary savings plan that has
significantly increased in value and to which the company
contributes 83 cents per dollar up to the first 6 percent of the
workers' income.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that Bell Atlantic retirees also receive medical and
dental benefits and discounted local telephone service. ``This
ranks among the best packages offered by any company in America,''
Marcus said.
</P>
<P>
   But although Bell Atlantic is offering increases to longtime
retirees, activists describe the raise as too little in an era of
high rents, food and transportation costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you put in 30 years you'll get an increase, but in today's
dollars it's really not much,'' said Ed Creegan, president of a
7,000-member retiree group for members of the Communications
Workers of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are seeing is that there are a lot of women who were
telephone operators and worked for the company for a long time, but
they are only getting a proportion of their total salary, which
leaves them with very, very little. And if you have 20 years, you
get nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Rita Scott was 16 when she started working for the phone company
54 years ago. By most accounts, it was an employer of choice for
women.
</P>
<P>
   Scott had six children during those years. Her mother helped her
and her husband by caring for the children until 1967, when Scott
quit to care for them full time.
</P>
<P>
   Now 70, she received a raise in her pension in July, to $350
from $261 a month. Asked how she manages to live, Scott said:
</P>
<P>
   ``When my husband died two years ago, I started receiving his
Social Security for about $1,000 per month, and his company gives
me $300. But we were paying more than $6,000 in taxes on our house
until my daughter and grandson got me a senior discount. Now, I'm
paying $2,300 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a good worker for the phone company,'' she added. ``I
was telephone operator when I started, but then I went on to become
a supervisor. I had a good rapport with the people I worked with.''

ON-LINE TRADING CLICKS WITH MAINSTREAM INVESTORS

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who is the new icon of America's obsession with investing? Is it
``Stuart,'' the frenetic 20-something with spiky orange hair who
hypes an Internet brokerage to his boss? Or is it Shelly Glazier, a
64-year-old medical office administrator who spends an hour each
night poring over her portfolio, trading stocks on line just
several times a year?
</P>
<P>
   ``Stuart,'' the wild-maned star of a television advertising
blitz by Ameritrade, a Web brokerage, might cast the country as a
nation of gamblers. But it is real people like Glazier who are
fueling a revolution in how Americans manage their money in the
digital era.
</P>
<P>
   In a pivotal shift, experts expect older citizens with sizable
income and middle-class folk with careful savings habits to
constitute the bulk of Web investors in the new millennium.
Aggressive traders like ``Stuart'' _ the original acolytes of
Internet stockpicking _ are peaking in number.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mainstream investors will form the majority of future on-line
investors,'' said Kenneth Clemmer, an analyst at Forrester
Research, a Cambridge, Mass. consulting company.
</P>
<P>
   When Internet brokers exploded onto the scene four years ago
with fast, low-cost trading, they targeted risk-lovers hoping to
get rich quick. Do-it-yourself stock-picking was a novelty.
Old-fashioned money managers like Merrill Lynch ignored the
upstarts. Even innovators like Charles Schwab, the pioneering
discount brokerage, were skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   Now on the defensive, established players are reinventing
themselves on line and transforming Web investing into a
mass-market phenomenon. The changes are prompting cyber-competitors
like E(asterisk)Trade and Datek to revamp themselves to appeal to
ordinary investors. ``Traditional is moving on line, and on-line is
becoming more traditional,'' said Dan Latimore, a consultant at
Mainspring, an e-commerce research firm.
</P>
<P>
   The convergence of the two worlds _ one rooted in branches,
stockbrokers, and advice, the other a click-and-trade planet _ has
ignited a war for the next generation of investors. Billboards are
plastered with pitches from on-line brokers old and new. TV is
glutted with dot.com investing spots.
</P>
<P>
   With free cars, trips, even million-dollar prizes, the come-ons
reflect a giant shift by Web-only brokers toward attracting
investors with stable assets, rather than restless traders. And the
ads underscore the old guard's belated acceptance of Internet
investing as a business here to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic stockpicking's original growth came from Web-only
brokers, where low costs attracted active investors _ mostly
``Stuart'' types, who trade scores of times a year; affluent,
aggressive investors; and ``day traders,'' who scoot in and out of
stocks dozens of times a day.
</P>
<P>
   But with most active traders already on line, brokers of all
stripes must find ways to lure ordinary investors, who want not
just cheap trading but extensive research, analysis, news, money
management, retirement planning, even advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a certain maturing of the market,'' said Richard
Sylla, a financial historian at New York University's Stern School
of Business. ``Instead of the glitz of trading, the talk is now
about how you can attract more stable customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider Glazier, by many indications one of on-line investing's
new, core customers. ``I would call myself an investor, not a
trader,'' said Glazier, who buys and sells stocks once every couple
of months through Charles Schwab &AMP; Co., the nation's biggest Web
investing company. ``Generally, I try to buy good companies to
begin with and stay with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Glazier, who manages appointments at Children's Medical Care
North in Chelsea, Mass., recently bought another 100 shares of Sun
Microsystems and dumped Boston Market, the ailing restaurant chain
acquired by McDonald's Corp. Unlike the first generation of Web
traders, Glazier keeps an account at a full-service brokerage,
Tucker Cleary. And she is still devoted to mutual funds _ only now
she buys them on line.
</P>
<P>
   Glazier's son, Kenneth, also trades on line, keeping accounts at
two discount brokers. ``They make it so easy _ you might trade
stocks that you might never buy if you had to pay more to a broker
to do it,'' said the orthopedic surgeon, 46. ``It's good to have
advice, even if it's on line.''
</P>
<P>
   In the years since the Internet turned brokers' $200 commissions
into do-it-yourself trades costing as little as $5, 7 million
households have opened on-line accounts. A recent survey found that
18 percent of investors now buy stocks via the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the greatest thing that ever came down the pike,'' said
Marcia Legg, 59, a retired nurse who recently put $128,000 of
savings into an on-line trading account at Fidelity Investments.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans still prefer mutual funds and broker-assisted
trades. But with half of all US households already invested in
stocks, and one in three equity trades made by individual investors
now placed through the Web, that is about to change: By 2003, 41
percent of stock-owning households are expected to trade on line.
</P>
<P>
   As ordinary investors flock to the Internet, they are rapidly
remaking the rules of Web investing, both for cyber-outposts and
traditional, pinstriped brokerages.
</P>
<P>
   With no branches and no human beings dispensing advice, dot.com
brokers make their money on how often clients trade stocks and on
interest from loans to customers, who then invest the borrowed
money.
</P>
<P>
   The business has flourished in a golden stock market. But with
profits tied to trading volumes, Web-only brokerages are vulnerable
to an economic downturn; Forrester predicts 3 in 4 eventually will
go bankrupt or be acquired.
</P>
<P>
   Now the goal is to attract stable customers with long-term
assets who are prepared to pay a little more for investment
management services.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest of the nation's 160 Web-only brokers handle as many
trades a day as the on-line operations of traditional brokers. But
with more assets and customers than the dot.coms, as well as the
branches their cybercousins lack, the old guard has an advantage.
Schwab and Fidelity handle 71 percent of all money invested on
line, or $465 billion, while the top Web-only broker, ETrade, has
one-tenth that amount. Merrill Lynch has branches across the
country and 5 million customers with $1.5 trillion in assets, while
Datek, the second-largest Web-only brokerage, has 290,000 customer
accounts, with $7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going after middle America, and we're seeing the
start of this, you'll need a physical presence,'' said Russell
Keene, an industry analyst at Putnam, Lovell, de Guardiola &AMP;
Thornton, a securities firm.
</P>
<P>
   A few traditional brokerages cautiously introduced limited Web
trading this year. But the arrival on line of older Americans with
retirement income and middle-class investors has forced the old
guard to embrace the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch, the world's largest broker, just introduced a
service allowing customers to trade stocks and bonds on line for
$29.95 a trade and tap into research, initial public offerings, and
on-line auctions.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab, once synomymous with discount brokerages, now wants to
be known as a full-service mass-market player _ on line. The
company, which now has 3 million customers on line, is holding 800
seminars a month through 2000 to educate ordinary mortals on
Internet investing. ``The idea is to make this thing that's a
mystery as easy as ordering a book from Amazon.com,'' said Charles
Schwab, the company's founder and chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity Investments, the world's biggest fund firm and a
leading discount broker, recently redesigned its Web trading site,
PowerStreet, to account for the fact that 80 percent of its
individual stock trades are now made on line. For funds, the figure
is 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even American Express has leaped on the bandwagon, offering free
trades to clients with accounts of at least $100,000. The service
is designed to appeal to stable, long-term investors.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts by old-line players to debunk on-line
stock-picking's image as an extreme sport has caused Web-only
brokers to soften their images and court a broader audience.
ETrade, for example, now mimics Fidelity and Schwab by selling
mutual funds, still America's favorite investment. Datek, a hot
spot with rapid-fire investors, is considering opening
old-fashioned branches and forging alliances with investment
advisers. ``We don't consider ourselves a day-trading outfit,''
said a spokesman, Michael Dunn.
</P>
<P>
   And while Ameritrade is spending $200 million to promote
``Stuart,'' it has also mailed out brochures featuring a fireman
and a florist _ Main Street investors. ``As on-line investing
becomes more of a way of life, a lot of these companies want to
shed their day-trading image,'' said Keene.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Legg, the retired nurse, would trade stocks only with
someone at her side. Now she feels comfortable enough to execute
her own transactions, generally every couple of months. ``For $25 a
trade,'' she asked, ``how can you lose?''

YULE BONUSES FADING PRACTICE AT BIG COMPANIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Each Christmas, for the last 14 years, hand sewer Shirley Tracy
has received a yuletide cash bonus from her employer, L.L. Bean
Inc. of Freeport, Maine. Tucked in a personalized greeting card,
this year's gift of $100 is a time-honored tradition dating back
more than three decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feeling you get when you receive your gift is that you're
part of the L.L. Bean family,'' said Tracy, 55, of Bowdoinham,
Maine. ``People put in long hours. Some even put their family lives
on hold to make sure customers are taken care of. So, the gift is a
show of appreciation.''
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, L.L. Bean, the large New England catalog and
retail company with 10,000 employees, is an anomaly: Only a handful
of big firms still offer the traditional holiday bonus.
</P>
<P>
   In this tight labor market and go-go economy, compensation
specialists say, such bonuses are now as rare as the horse and
buggy, though some small firms uphold the tradition. Most large
employers now favor stock options, fiscal year-end bonuses tied to
performance, and other forms of profit-sharing, all of which fit
under the rubric ``variable compensation.''
</P>
<P>
   Firms feel that the Christmas bonus ``doesn't give as much
return on investment as the performance-related bonus, which is
given throughout the year and not just during the holidays,'' said
Cindi Fukami, a management professor at the Daniels College of
Business in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   The thriving US economy, with unemployment hovering at record
lows and productivity on the rise, has not resulted in a rash of
holiday gift-giving or cash bonuses for the vast majority of US
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Holiday gifts of food, merchandise, or cash will be distributed
this December to workers at 37 percent of 413 firms polled by the
Bureau of National Affairs Inc., down from 40 percent last year.
Only 9 percent of firms with 1,000 or more employees will
distribute cash gifts to workers, according to the BNA, a privately
held research company that focuses on public policy and employment
issues. By contrast, 25 percent of small companies polled will
offer modest cash gifts tied to the holidays rather than
profit-sharing, with median gifts of $100 for nonmanagers to about
$150 for managers.
</P>
<P>
   This nationwide shift from the traditional yuletide bonus to
performance-based rewards is as much cultural as it is financial.
The new paradigm was ushered in by downsizings, mergers, and
increased competition, all of which have come at the cost of
long-held traditions and corporate lore. And since employment
longevity is now measured in a few years rather than in decades,
rewards for work tend to be more immediate, tied to the present
rather than the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Folks who still receive holiday bonuses tend to work at
smaller, privately held companies that have had a history of
offering them. It's ingrained in their culture,'' said James
Hudner, a consultant at Towers Perrin in Boston, a human resources
consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, increasingly, the expectation is that the employees
will not be at the company indefinitely, which means the rewards
have to be a lot more tangible,'' he said. ``They must relate to
how the individual performed, or how the team performed, or how the
organization as a whole performed, as opposed to past times, when
the message with a holiday bonus was simply, `Thanks for being part
of the family.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Fukami of Daniels College said, ``The Christmas bonus is a bit
like the annual civil service raise, which means if I'm living and
breathing and sitting at my desk, then I'll get it.''
</P>
<P>
   At R.A.D. Employment Services Inc. in Boston, president Bob A.
Dorne gives cash bonuses to his 10 employees during the week
between Christmas and New Year's. ``I do it based on longevity and
how well the business is doing,'' said Dorne, who declined to
reveal the amount.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman at Millipore Corp. in Bedford, which develops,
manufactures, and sells purification products to the pharmaceutical
and research markets, couldnot remember whether the firm had ever
offered the old-fashioned holiday bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have profit-sharing, which is mainly for senior managers,''
said Millipore's Barbara Russo. ``And we have a cash bonus plan for
all 2,000 employees in the United States, based on the results of
the corporation.''
</P>
<P>
   The company employs 1,500 in three facilities in Massachusetts,
about a third of its worldwide employee total. According to Russo,
the minimum cash outlay is 1 percent of a worker's salary. Awards
of 2 percent and 5 percent are also given out in February, based on
corporate financial targets.
</P>
<P>
   No bonuses were offered last year because of a downturn in the
semiconductor industry, but the company expects to reward workers
this year, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity Investments in Boston offers profit-sharing, stock, and
annual bonuses in December. ``The end of the year is when we
determine how well we perform, which means the bonus is not tied to
the holiday at all,'' said spokesman Vincent Loporchio. The company
employs 29,300 worldwide, of whom more than 12,000 work in
Massachusetts. ``Some part of our compensation program reaches
virtually all of our employees.''
</P>
<P>
   At Tom's of Maine, spokeswoman Katherine Taggersell said, ``We
want to respect our workers, but it shouldn't just apply to the
holiday. So, we don't have a Christmas bonus. Instead, we give out
24-pound turkeys at Thanksgiving. We offer perks throughout the
year, and we have profit-sharing bonuses that everybody shares in,
including front-line factory staff.'' The Kennebunk maker of
natural personal care products employs 120.
</P>
<P>
   Natick-based Zweig White &AMP; Associates, a management consulting
firm with 55 employees in five cities, offered holiday cash bonuses
when it opened its doors 11 years ago. It no longer does.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we grew larger and wanted to create a system that tied
everyone into overall performance, we switched to a program paying
25 percent of profits to employees on a quarterly basis,'' said
Mark Zweig, president and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   In a hot labor market, say specialists, stock options and other
performance-based awards can help employers recruit top workers
without raising real wages.
</P>
<P>
   ``One way to interpret these alternative forms of compensation
is that they are a way to help workers cash in on booming sales
without adjusting wage structures and raising pay for everybody,''
said Jared Bernstein, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   If the stock market falls, however, stock options and
profit-sharing cannot compete with a raise in base pay.
</P>
<P>
   Offering stock packages may also help employers overcome the
wage compression problems companies sometimes encounter during
periods of full employment. When wages compress, gaps between
entry-level pay and average professional salaries begin to close,
causing seasoned employees to leave in search of higher salaries
and better benefits.
</P>
<P>
   In the best-case scenario, both wage and salary employees
benefit from performance-based bonuses. ``When companies use
profit-sharing, most wage and salary employees will benefit,'' said
Paul Harrington, an economist at Northeastern University's Center
for Labor Market Studies. But, he added, most manufacturing
companies don't offer profit-sharing. ``Most hourly people get a
salary and that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Where compensation varies across the spectrum, however, those in
highest demand are more likely to receive stock options or large
cash bonuses tied to year-end corporate results than is the man or
woman in front-line manufacturing, entry-level, or nonprofessional
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody really gets cash anymore,'' said Bob Lyle, business
agent of the The New England Joint Board of the Retail and
Wholesale Department Store Union. ``Mostly, it's the upper echelon
of management that gets the big bucks.''
</P>
<P>
   When Towers Perrin surveyed 500 US firms about their
compensation plans, it found that of the 59 New England firms
polled, 75 percent had some type of variable compensation plan in
place for professionals. Of those, only 50 percent had plans that
covered nonprofessional staff.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1912, L.L. Bean opened its first retail store in
1917. By then, owner Leon Leonwood Bean had a thriving business and
a small army of factory workers hand-sewing the company's trademark
moccasins, boat shoes, and slippers.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy, who began working at the Brunswick, Maine, plant in 1985,
describes hand-sewing as a dying art, and says the cash gift is a
tradition front-line workers such as herself have come to expect.
This year, L.L. Bean is giving $100 to employees with a year or
more on the job, $40 to workers with at least three months'
service, and $20 to seasonal employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot of hard work,'' Tracy said of her job. ``People
really appreciate the gift because it goes beyond what most
companies do. Even the temporary workers who haven't been here long
get something.''

JUDGE ALLOWS SUIT AGAINST SCIENTOLOGY MEMBER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A top official in the Church of Scientology can be named a
defendant in a lawsuit stemming from the controversial 1995 death
of a church member, a Florida judge has ruled.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa McPherson was a Scientology church member who died while in
the care of other church members after suffering a mental breakdown
and physical problems in Clearwater, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   In their lawsuit, McPherson's family alleges that David
Miscavige, a top Scientology official, is in complete control of
Scientology and oversaw McPherson's medical care.
</P>
<P>
   According to a medical examiner's report, she died of a blood
clot caused by prolonged bed rest and dehydration. Miscavige is
chairman of the board of the Religious Technology Center that,
according to church documents, is mainly responsible for
safeguarding Scientology copyrights and trademarks.
</P>
<P>
   The church has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in McPherson's
death.
</P>
<P>
   According to published reports, after suffering a breakdown,
McPherson was kept for 17 days at a Scientology-owned hotel in
Clearwater where she was kept in isolation and given herbal
remedies, vitamins and sedatives.
</P>
<P>
   Despite losing nearly 50 pounds, McPherson was never examined by
a licensed medical doctor. By the time she was taken to a hospital
she was pronounced dead on arrival.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Miscavige told The St. Petersburg Times he was not
responsible for overseeing McPherson's medical treatment. The
family's suit, however, alleges he was aware of McPherson's serious
health problems and instructed her caretakers on what do for her.
</P>
<P>
   A trial in the case had been set for next June but the ruling by
Hillsborough County Circuit Court Judge James S. Moody involving
Miscavage likely means a long delay in the case because Scientology
attorneys say Miscavage will have to hire his own lawyers.

</P>
<P>
   About 200 religious leaders, officials of human rights
organizations and representatives of college groups have sent an
open letter to President Clinton asking him to speak out on the
civil war in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We implore you, in the name of countless lost Sudanese, to
raise the profile of Sudan and to add your public voice and
leadership to ensuring the success'' of peace talks between the
Sudanese government and rebels in the southern part of the African
nation, the letter stated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your voice above all others _ declaring to the world the
reality of Sudan's agony _ will be heard and heeded,'' states the
letter dated Dec. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Some estimates place the number of dead in the brutal conflict
between the Islamic government and the largely Christian and
animist rebels at 2 million.
</P>
<P>
   The signers of the letters urged the Clinton administration to
support legislation to allow the shipment of US humanitarian aid to
the rebel group, the Sudanese People's Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal has triggered intense debate among humanitarian and
human rights groups.

BATTLING BIGNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO -- Holiday shoppers are still mourning String Box
Books, missing its cozy atmosphere and knowledgeable service. The
place went dark on Halloween in a pattern familiar in cities and
towns: Small stores close, unable to compete with big chains and
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In the mayoral election here, an anti-Seattle theme resounded as
chain stores became an issue. ``No more Starbucks!'' swore several
candidates, denouncing the coffee conglomerate that brews bigness
in the same city as Amazon.com, which advertises ``Earth's biggest
selection'' of books and things.
</P>
<P>
   Caffeine and literature are not just centuries-old hallmarks of
urban civilization. They are now commodities and political
footballs.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, challenger Tom Ammiano declared war on
``gentrification,'' which he defined not as people fixing up their
houses, but as big chains displacing mom-and-pop stores. Mayor
Willie Brown dissented, saying many urban areas would welcome a
national chain.
</P>
<P>
   In the precious precincts of liberal consumerism, Starbucks is
unwelcome and McDonald's is aesthetically incorrect. But in
thousands of square miles of urban America, residents would cheer
and celebrate a Burger King. As cities revive economically, many
neighborhoods remain undeveloped. In their need to join the
mainstream, they are not fussy about brand names.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot is now among the companies that define the Dow Jones
average. Is this bad news for Hank's Hardware? Not necessarily. An
urban neighborhood is by definition a niche market where
independent merchants can thrive.
</P>
<P>
   Should government be in the business of excluding brand names
solely because of their bigness? Urban sales differ from a
big-chain retailer destabilizing the economy of a small town. The
National Trust for Historic Preservation has fought valiantly
against such projects, but cities are less fragile. Cities, in
fact, depend on change.
</P>
<P>
   Here, Brown won the election and the argument. His 20-point
victory in the nation's most liberal city reaffirmed the primacy of
the market. Even in a neighborhood Ammiano carried easily,
consumers tend to vote with their wallets. At the corner of Haight
and Ashbury streets, Ben &AMP; Jerry's, a chain, sells lots of ice
cream. At another corner, The Gap, a clothing chain, unloads tons
of duds.
</P>
<P>
   Boycotting Starbucks might be effective, but it hasn't been
tried. When one opens in a supposedly hostile neighborhood, folks
line up for lattes. In some nonchain coffee shops, Mom and Pop
don't pay too well, which may account for the help's attitude,
wretched taste in music, and massive display of nose rings and
eyebrow armor.
</P>
<P>
   Crocodile tears have lubricated the history of American
innovation. When Howard Johnson franchised his original restaurant
in Wollaston, Mass., some complained about its principal virtue of
consistency, but HoJo standards helped halt the spread of ptomaine
by independent greasy-spoon diners. When Kemmons Wilson founded
Holiday Inns in 1951, similar snickers ensued, but he offered a
cleaner alternative to fleabag motels.
</P>
<P>
   Innovation succeeds, despite pseudo-environmental and
hypocritical complaints. The most honest mourner in the last days
of String Box books confessed that he'll miss browsing, examining a
book, then going home and ordering it on the Internet: ``Hey, it's
30 percent off and no 8.5 percent sales tax.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, during the first Earth Day ceremonies, ``Pogo,'' the
creation of the late cartoonist Walt Kelly, amended the dispatch
Oliver Hazard Perry sent from the US brig Niagara in 1813. Having
conquered a larger British fleet during the War of 1812, Perry told
General William Henry Harrison, summering by the Sandusky River,
``We have met the enemy, and they are ours.''
</P>
<P>
   In today's global economy, consumerism answers its own
complaints. As Pogo said, ``We have met the enemy and he is us.''

A SUCCESS STORY AT FENWAY HIGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Melissa Rivera was the first student to hand in her senior
humanities portfolio last Friday at Fenway High School. This was
something, considering her two-page introduction. She wrote: ``I
dreaded having to do this assignment. I have never written a 7-10
page paper before and I did not think that I could do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her topic was Bosnia. She wrote a 7 1/2-page research paper, a
three-page opinion paper, and an extensive bibliography that
included The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, National
Public Radio, The Boston Globe, and The Nation.
</P>
<P>
   She also had three pages of fiction, based on her research. She
chose to write about a child whose family was hunted down by
Croatian soldiers. Her mother was beaten to death. Her father was
executed. She fled to a hole in the wall of the building her father
was shot in. She stayed there for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fear ran through my body every time I heard the smallest
noise,'' Rivera wrote. ``I left the hole twice to get some food
from my dad's bag. He still lay there . . . After two weeks passed,
I had run out of food . . . one night . . . I heard voices coming
up the stairs. As they got closer I knew that they were Croatian
soldiers by the heavy accents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I returned back into the hole and closed my eyes. I had been
catching a cold so I was sneezing and my nose was running. They
came into the room that I was in. I had no idea what they were
doing there, but I knew that I had to be silent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I sneezed, which got their attention. I heard footsteps
getting closer and closer to the hole, and right then the Bosnian
soldiers entered the room and started shooting the Croatian
soldiers. I began to scream and I didn't stop until a Bosnian
soldier pulled me out of the hole. One of them dropped their hat as
they saw me. I knew the face, but I was afraid, so I couldn't put a
name on it. After about 30 seconds I realized that it was my cousin
Imir.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivera knows there is editing ahead. Her teacher, Eileen
Shakespear, said her 45 humanities students will have to rewrite
their portfolio pieces several times if they want to pass. That did
not take the glow off Rivera's face. She said, ``This is the
hardest thing I've ever done,'' but once the portfolio was in, she
hardly seemed to be in a rush to leave. A few minutes later, she
was down in school office, helping a secretary fold fliers.
</P>
<P>
   This did not escape the eyes of Fenway High Director Larry
Myatt. ``She's one of those kids who we've been able to scrape away
at the anger. She's not an angry kid anymore. Now she's got all of
her dreams in front of her.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivera, 19, is on the honor roll at Fenway, the 250-student
pilot school. She is thinking about going to Suffolk, Brandeis,
Northeastern, Florida State, or Lesley College. This is a long way
from her early adolescence. She was held back twice in middle
school for poor grades. She said she was wrong not to take school
seriously, but she also felt lost in the chaos of the overwhelmed
Boston public middle schools she attended.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no relationships between teachers and students,''
Rivera said. ``They just shoved worksheets at you, you turned them
back in, and that was the last you'd ever see of the assignment.
There was no critique, no feedback, it was like once the assignment
was over, it never existed. Spelling tests were a joke. They'd give
you these words, but no one ever discussed the context of why the
words were important, and no one ever used the words again once the
test was over.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivera said that even when she started doing better in school,
she still remained invisible to her teachers. She remembers very
little contact between teachers and her mother. She said that when
she finally graduated from middle school, a teacher walked up to
her after the ceremony, shook her hand, and said,
``Congratulations. We didn't think you'd make it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he was trying to be funny, or maybe he was trying to
make me feel like I accomplished something, but it still hurt,''
Rivera said. ``I know I was 15 at the time, and that's old for
middle school, but it still sent me a message that they never took
me seriously even when I tried harder.''
</P>
<P>
   At Fenway, where intimacy is a trademark, Rivera was taken
seriously to the breaking point. ``At first, I couldn't get a B in
math for anything,'' she said. ``I had an assignment on patterns
that I was buggin' out so much I was almost crying.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there is no running away here. You can't hide in school
because the teachers are always on you. You can't hide at home
because the teachers will call your parents. This school isn't
rich, but everyone here cares. We have an open campus and if you
wanted to, you could just walk out. But because of the
encouragement, you don't want to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   When Rivera graduates, she could apply her short story to her
own life. She once had been a child who could have rotted away in a
hole in the wall of her public school. She is not a child who
likely would have improved enough by 10th grade to pass the MCAS.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for her, she was pulled out by an army that cared enough
_ and had enough energy _ not to let her hide anymore.

   We've read and watched enough of such compilations to know that
no ``best of'' list covering the past century can be created
without causing controversy _ every inclusion and exclusion is open
to question. Well, how about raising the stakes _ taking a look at
the world from the beginning of time to the distant future? And let
me correct that: not just the world, but the solar system, too.
</P>
<P>
   It would seem impossible, but this is National Geographic. And
it does well with big concepts. ``Adventures in Time: The National
Geographic Millennium Special,'' was so dazzling, you didn't about
your particular agenda, your own definitive list.
</P>
<P>
   Via stunning cinematography, hoisted out of the incredible vault
of documentary footage, we visit ancient tombs in Egypt; watch a
gruesomely determined band of chimpanzees hunt and kill a colobus
monkey; learn about an MIT robot that can ``learn''; and watch a
conjured-up futuristic swim team of young people who have been
cleansed of any genetic defect.
</P>
<P>
   We travel underwater and into space; we puzzle out the primitive
and progressive; we can celebrate the beauty of the planet and get
the creeps from scientific predictions of cataclysmic tornadoes,
earthquakes, monsoons, and even ``Doomsday asteroids'' that could
``strike at any time.''
</P>
<P>
   Solid and scintillating, ``Adventures in Time,'' narrated by
John Lithgow, and produced by the always impressive Nicholas Stein,
gets two opposable thumbs up.

Pops show draws a record crowd &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Holiday at Pops,'' featuring Keith Lockhart and the Boston
Pops Orchestra and a reading of `` 'Twas the Night Before
Christmas'' by Conan O'Brien, drew an audience of 1.5 million
households Saturday on the A&AMP;E Network. It was the largest audience
the annual concert has drawn in the seven years it has aired on the
cable channel. . . . The crackling debate Sunday on NBC's ``Meet
the Press'' between Democratic presidential candidates Al Gore and
Bill Bradley _ arguably the highlight of the campaign season thus
far _ drew 4.71 million viewers. That was 2 million more than CBS's
``Face the Nation'' and ABC's ``This Week,'' further establishing
the dominance of ``Meet the Press'' as the 2000 campaign gears up.
. . . Another day, another example of convergence: ABC announced
Tuesday that its Web site abcnews.com will be part of ``a daily
synchronized Internet-television experience'' with ``World News
Now,'' the network's overnight news program.

Controversial `SNL' sketch to repeat
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After considerable waffling on the status of a ``Saturday Night
Live'' skit titled ``And So This Is Hanukkah,'' NBC has announced
that the sketch, which drew complaints after its initial broadcast,
will indeed be included in the series's future rerun rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have reviewed the viewer response to the SNL sketch and
have decided that it will air again unedited,'' the network said in
a statement. ``Today's environment makes our judgment calls in
these situations increasingly difficult because we must find a
balance between being politically correct and being funny in a
nonhurtful way.''
</P>
<P>
   That didn't satisfy Abraham Foxman, national director of the
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith.
</P>
<P>
   ``It almost sounds like a poll that they never took,'' he said
Tuesday. ``Most of the people who were upset called us.''
</P>
<P>
   The sketch, which aired Dec. 4, featured impersonators of pop
stars Britney Spears, Celine Dion, and Mariah Carey in a mock
network promo explaining why they were appearing on an imaginary
Hanukkah TV special.
</P>
<P>
   The Spears character, portrayed by actress Christina Ricci, says
that Christians have forgiven Jews for ``having killed our Lord.''

`GATSBY' A NEW AMERICAN CLASSIC BORN OF ANOTHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Out of one national classic, F. Scott Fitzgerald's
``The Great Gatsby,'' John Harbison has fashioned another, one of
the best operas composed by an American to date. The Metropolitan
Opera's premiere of ``Gatsby'' Monday night, the composer's 61st
birthday, was the culmination of a dream of decades. Obstacles
stood in the way, but in hindsight, they were fortunate ones,
because when he finally came to ``Gatsby,'' Harbison was ready.
</P>
<P>
   The composer wrote his own effective libretto, most of it
incorporating Fitzgerald's language; in creating parallels,
interconnections, deep structure, Harbison has set it up for music.
There are two intimate lounge scenes, two scenes in Wilson's garage
under the unseeing billboard eyes of Dr. T. J. Eckleburg, two big
contrasting party scenes. The text necessarily gives the characters
some of what Fitzgerald supplies only by indirection, an inner
life; the music takes us the rest of the way. The printed libretto
left one wondering how Harbison would cope with the rest of the
story once Gatsby is dead and Daisy fled; his response was to
supply some of the greatest music in any American opera,
particularly Nick's aria about inner journeys, with an
accompaniment that clicks along like wheels over metal track and
the distant sound of a train whistle. All of these shallow,
self-absorbed people, not just Gatsby, are tormented by unfulfilled
yearnings; all of them face a flickering green light at the end of
the pier that represents a dream already over, even though they
don't know it.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to think of another American opera composed with a
comparable degree of musical sophistication and sheer virtuoso
compositional chops. Many kinds of music interweave in ``Gatsby.''
Harbison takes a Haydnesque delight in musical tone-painting: There
is weather in his music, and automobiles, radios and ringing
telephones _ and that train. There is period music in a series of
'20s-style dance tunes and pop songs (with lyrics by Murray
Horwitz) _ these songs sound authentic, but only one of them
suggests anything we already know (although Kurt Weill's ``Speak
low'' hovers behind an offstage tune). The pop music defines the
character's milieu and social status (Myrtle, the wife of the
garage mechanic, sings the blues). The orchestration is colorful,
various, and luminous.
</P>
<P>
   The dialogue bounces off the rhythms, tricky and unstable when
unmoored from the songs; strong feelings and unfulfilled longings
deconstruct the stable intervals and harmonies of the songs. There
are arias (Gatsby has two of them, the second, perhaps, not adding
anything to the first), and a glorious love duet for Gatsby and
Daisy, Some the ensembles rival the great Mozart finales or the end
of Act 2 of ``Die Meistersinger'' in complexity of simultaneous
events. Above all, Harbison is flexible. The music moves easily
from scene-painting to exposition to dialogue, arioso, ensemble,
and back again. There is immediate appeal in the score but also a
network of internal reference so intricate it will take years of
repeated hearings to understand. The music also leads to outside
points of reference : Daisy and Jordan sing of boredom in the
opening scene, and it is like the ``Benares Song'' from
``Mahagonny,'' yet also like the glistening duet of the sisters at
a comparable moment in the opening act of Strauss's ``Arabella'' _
ennui lifted to the level of ecstasy. Allusive as the music
sometimes is, the language is by now entirely Harbison's own _ as
is the compassionate generosity of feeling the language expresses.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Yeargan's sets provided a somewhat flimsy background,
perhaps intentionally; Jane Greenwood's costumes were fabulous _
and Gatsby's pink suit matched Duane Schuler's sunset lighting.
Mark Lamos's direction of the intimate scenes were at times
effective, but he distanced some of them behind scrims. The party
scenes were hideously cluttered and disastrously unfocused; they
offered a very peculiar notion of what a licentious party is like.
Some performers were grossly misdirected, including the
theatrically charismatic Lorraine Hunt Lieberson, who played Myrtle
as a porn-flick slut _ the point about Myrtle is that she, like
Gatsby, aspires to a false standard of gentility, while unknowingly
representing a higher one. But Lieberson's gorgeous singing of
Myrtle's blues, with pinpoint control of colors and dynamics, was
the vocal highlight of the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Hadley, a capable, likable, and uncharismatic tenor found
the role of his career in Gatsby; he sang wonderfully and even his
brilliantined posing fed into a plausible and affecting
characterization. Dawn Upshaw looked marvelous, moved deliciously,
and found herself stretched by some of Daisy's music (this opera,
like Mozart's, does belong in a smaller theater). Susan Graham and
Mark Baker were powerhouses as Jordan Baker and Tom Buchanan.
Dwayne Croft looked a little old for Nick, but he caught the wonder
of that great last aria, and ended the opera on a high G that made
the past resound into an infinite future. All the smaller roles are
worthwhile and the performers _ Richard Paul Fink, Matthew
Polenzani, William Powers, Frederick Burchinal, and Leroy Lehr _
made the most of them.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; James Levine led a snappy performance that sounded confident
and convinced of the work's merits.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered sounds of discontent appeared at the end of the first
act but a substantial welcome for cast and opera at the end turned
into a standing ovation when Levine pulled Harbison on. After the
applause was over, some additional music stole out into the
auditorium from behind the gold curtain; some very fancy voices
were singing ``Happy Birthday, Dear John.''

WIRED TO THE FUTURE; CHEETAH CHIC; THEY CALL HIM PRINCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH CARNEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The end of 1999 is producing a lot of miserable magazine covers
(see this week's People crown Julia Roberts the year's most
intriguing person). But in the midst of all the year and decade and
century rehashing, Wired (January) offers a refreshing antidote in
an issue devoted to the future.
</P>
<P>
   Between articles on the race to bring space travel to the masses
by ``do-it-yourself astropreneurs'' and the prospects for
drastically extending the human life span is an amusing,
stream-of-conscious ``conversation'' among a variety of thinkers
about life in the future. In keeping with Wired's propensity for
funky, sometimes unreadable, layouts, the piece packs together
quotes in no apparent order. The collection zigzags through topics
ranging from fashion to technology to the various luminaries'
wishlists. The piece is both whimsical and thought provoking.
</P>
<P>
   From Tim Berners-Lee (inventor of the World Wide Web and author
of ``Weaving the Web'') : ``We won't be using the word Internet in
2020, just as today we don't say, `I saw an interesting article on
a piece of paper today.' People will simply talk about the
information.'' Super chef Julia Child offers suggestions for
culinary innovations: ``How about fresh peas that are quicker to
shell _ you'd just pull one end of it and all the peas would pop
out! You could also have a suction gadget that would suck out the
fat and not the juice in a frying pan very quickly. (That would
probably have to be electronic, don't you think?).'' And from the
DJ Moby: ``The future smells like the Washington, D.C., subway
system.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While Wired aggressively woos the cutting-edge crowd, a stealth
hip magazine for 20-somethings is (brace yourself) National
Geographic. Why not? Visually rich, apolitical, slightly retro, the
magazine is perfect plane reading for young professionals who want
to daydream about exotic places they don't have time to visit. The
December cover features a story about cheetahs, the fastest animals
on land.
</P>
<P>
   If you get past the arresting photos, writer Richard Conniff
offers a fascinating primer on the only big cats who don't attack
humans and _ who knew? _ don't roar. (They sometimes growl, but
with each other they chirp like birds.) Though so beautiful that
Conniff finds it difficult to write about them (``My inclination
has always been to write about less popular animals on Earth,'' he
writes), he tells us that many ranchers in their African habitat
consider them vermin, which is one reason they are disappearing
from the landscape. One owner of a trophy hunting ranch in Namibia
who Conniff interviews killed 17 cheetahs last year and still lost
$24,000 worth of prize game to the cats. ``Oh!,'' the rancher is
quoted as saying. ``my heart pumps blood. One day you feel that the
cheetah also has a right to stay here. But you get angry, and the
moment you see a cheetah, you start shooting. I think you would
feel the same.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hip-hop mogul Puff Daddy's new magazine ``Notorious'' hasn't
been around long enough to probe its archive for end-of-the-year
wrap-ups, but that doesn't stop it from making a stab in its
``millennium issue.'' In the centerpiece story ``The Notorious 25''
the mag calls on today's celebrities to comment on the century's
icons: Lil Kim on Madonna, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Rachel Carson,
publisher Puff Daddy on Motown records founder Berry Gordy. While
some of the comments are interesting (of Muhammad Ali, Evander
Holyfield says: ``I didn't think much of Ali's mouth when I was
young, as I was brought up quite different. My family didn't follow
boxing.''), many of the pairings come off as random.
</P>
<P>
   The better feature is the cover story on the real poster boy for
1999, the Artist Formerly Known as Prince. With a new album (Rave
Un2 The Joy Fantastic) out under a new label (Arista), the artist
has been opening up more to the press. Still, the profile by
Dimitri Ehrlich serves up some delicious details from a visit to
his Minneapolis recording studio Paisley Park.
</P>
<P>
   To start, the artist who used to be called His Royal Badness has
changed his behavior since becoming friends with the former bassist
for Sly and the Family Stone, Larry Graham, a devout Christian.
Under Graham's influence, the artist has given up cursing and bans
it from Paisley Park. He also doesn't allow employees to smoke,
drink, or bring meat or fish into the building. He goes out at
night with Graham unaccompanied by bodyguards and even pumps his
own gas. At Paisley Park, he keeps a cage of white doves that make
``an eerie rooster-like crowing.'' His staff still calls him
Prince.
</P>
<P>
   The artist remains inscrutable, speaking of Prince as though he
were another person. He insists that while he released the album,
it was produced by Prince, whom he refers to in the third person.
``Our relationship is not contentious. It's an agreement. Prince
has the final say. He's the producer. And basically he came in and
took a look at that old Linn drum machine we used on our early
hits, and he said This is how we rolled it in '92, and this is how
we rollin' in 99. And that was it.''

`ANY GIVEN SUNDAY' WINS THE GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
ANY GIVEN SUNDAY 
Directed by: Oliver Stone 
Screenplay by: Stone, John Logan 
Starring: Al Pacino, Cameron Diaz, Dennis Quaid, James Woods, Jamie
Foxx, LL Cool J, Matthew Modine, Charlton Heston,
Ann-Margret,  Aaron Eckhart, Eckhardt, John C. McGinley, Jim Brown,
Lawrence Taylor 
Running time: 161 minutes 
Rated: R (strong language and some nudity and /sexuality) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You practically need a face mask and helmet to get through
Oliver Stone's new football movie, ``Any Given Sunday.'' It keeps
coming at you, keeps hammering you, and has absolutely no business
being as entertaining as it is. If Stone ever gets tired of making
movies, his brilliant machine-gun editing alone would earn him top
dollar on a sports network. The film goes through the motions of
goofing on the things that are wrong with the game, but it's too
hooked on its own testosterone, to say nothing of football's, not
to seem like one of those long, hard-fought games in the mud that
somehow winds up in the win column.
</P>
<P>
   On any given Sunday, any pro football team can beat any other
pro football team. That tidbit of sports gospel supplies the film's
title, and it is driving Vince Lombardi wannabe Al Pacino nuts. Up
and down the sidelines he prowls, venting, venting, venting, when
he isn't looking tight-lipped and grim. Lately, he's been looking
tight-lipped and grim a lot because his Miami team has been losing
too many games. His star quarterback is ailing, the owner is
talking about selling the franchise or moving it to LA if she can
get a stadium deal, and the third-string hot dog who's so tensed up
that he begins each game by throwing up suddenly starts clicking
and referring to Pacino's Tony D'Amato as Coach Stone Age.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense he is, but the film takes the view that he isn't
necessarily wrong. He's old school, uncomfortable with the
high-pressure trimmings that have attached themselves to the big
business football has become. The hits are pretty jolting, but the
ones on the field don't reverberate as hard as the hits in the
game's new high-stakes corporate warfare. Tough as the slabs of
muscle who launch themselves at each other every Sunday may be,
they're not as tough as Cameron Diaz's team owner trying to prove
to her dead father that she can be as tough as the son he never
had. She scares the league president (a nice piece of
tongue-in-cheek casting: Charlton Heston as the Moses of pro
football).
</P>
<P>
   She's the closest the film comes to freshness and surprise.
Until she's channeled into sentimentality, it's a nice stretch for
her. The coach isn't afraid of her. He's known her since she was a
little girl and he's friends with her mother _ a rueful but stylish
former alcoholic played with warmth and economy by Ann-Margret. But
his long antennae tell him that good things are not coming. He's
not into image-mongering, he's not glib, and he doesn't want to be
bothered about turning into a marketing-oriented barracuda. Stone
(obviously enjoying himself in a cameo as a radio announcer)
presumably couldn't clear rights with the NFL, so he uses
fictitious names for his teams and league. The Miami Dolphins
become the Miami Sharks, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   The stage was set for some smart, scathing skewering of the
celebrity and sports and marketing culture we have become. Stone
begins the job but, quickly seduced by the macho aspects of the
game and this particular gang of warriors, he veers into a
celebration of chest-pounding. ``Any Given Sunday'' is far too
long, but its rambunctiousness is engaging, propelled as it is by
Stone's virtuosic quick-cutting, and the high jinks of Dennis
Quaid's veteran player, Jamie Foxx's upstart, LL Cool J's
far-from-unassertive running back, Jim Brown's rocklike defensive
coordinator, and real-life grid great Lawrence Taylor as a
concussion-prone star linebacker. Most of the high-priced grunts on
the field are good guys. Most of the guys who labor off the field
are heavies, from James Woods's dope-'em-up-and-let-'em-play team
orthopedist to John C. McGinley's self-important, flame-fanning
media snake.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not the ideal audience for ``Any Given Sunday.'' To me, the
most interesting thing about football is the shape of the ball.
That being said, and the overextended parts of ``Any Given Sunday''
being acknowledged, I have to admit to getting caught up in its
nonsense, including the corny climactic game. There's no shortage
of color and vigor in this pumped-up movie. Most of the time, it's
jock heaven. But I do wish it hadn't allowed itself to be so easily
diverted from its criticism of the game and the values that drive
it, and veer off instead into macho backslapping. In that respect,
``Any Given Sunday'' resembles the games that got away from coach
D'Amato and his players.

STRONG WOMEN ABOUND IN `ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER 
Directed and written by: Pedro Almodovar 
Starring: Cecilia Roth, Marisa Paredes, Candela Pena, Antonia San
Juan, Penelope Cruz, Rosa Maria Sarda, Fernando Fernan Gomez, Toni
Canto, Eloy Azorin 
Running time: 101 minutes (in Spanish with English subtitles) 
Rated: R (sexuality, including strong sexual dialogue, strong
language, and some drug content) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although sexual boundaries blur in Pedro Almovodar's ``All About
My Mother,'' there's never any doubt that he admires women wildly.
In his films, they're the ones who are left standing at the end,
enduring, keeping life _ such as it is _ going. They may live on
the verge of nervous breakdowns, but they cope, they deal, they
prop up the men in their lives. ``All About My Mother'' spirals
into delirium, but its source in Almodovar's regard for his own
mother and her strengths in their machista region of La Mancha is
beyond doubt. He dedicates the film to actresses who have played
actresses _ Bette Davis, Gena Rowlands, Romy Schneider. It's not
literally about his mother. But clearly her hardy, resourceful
spirit permeates the terrific women's ensemble that makes this
screwball soap opera hum.
</P>
<P>
   It's full of Almodovar's trademark saturated colors and farcical
rambunctiousness. But it's also got a tragic sense, and it
reinforces the impression that Almodovar is one of the relatively
rare filmmakers who is finding ways to sustain his stylistic
vitality while maturing from sexual iconoclast to sexual humanist.
``All About My Mother'' celebrates nurturing, maternal energies, as
expressed through a rich female lineup. At its center is Cecilia
Roth as a single mother named Manuela, who fled Barcelona for
Madrid when she found she was pregnant by a wayward lout. On the
night she promised to reveal all to her now-grown son, he has an
accident after chasing the star of a stage performance of ``A
Streetcar Named Desire.''
</P>
<P>
   Reversing her flight of 18 years earlier, Manuela takes a train
from Madrid to Barcelona to confront the boy's father. Instead,
some unruly realities start confronting her. In no time, she meets
up with an old transsexual pal (Antonia San Juan's agreeable
streetwalking pro named La Agrado), the high-strung veteran actress
playing Blanche in ``Streetcar'' (Marisa Paredes's Huma Rojo), the
actress playing Stella (Candela Pena's Nina, who is also the star's
lover), and a young nun (Penelope Cruz's Hermana Rosa) who has been
rather too charitable. The Bette Davis-like Huma Roja needs an
assistant. The nun needs mothering from someone other than her
biological mother. Manuela finds herself cast in both roles.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of energy is spent relying on the kindness of strangers,
and the film is both bleeding and goofy as Almodovar deftly plays
the one quality against the other. From the start, Almodovar has
been sympathetic to society's outsiders, especially transvestites,
never more so than here. As the film teeters giddily between ``All
About Eve'' and ``How to Marry a Millionaire,'' it keeps dancing a
few steps ahead of us. Not until close to the end do we sense a
pattern emerging. The payoff that arrives when the laughs depart is
a generous one. Nothing is resolved at the expense of the women;
never does Almodovar set them against one another. In Almodovar's
films, sex makes the world go round. But when its uproar subsides,
``All About My Mother'' emits an endearing afterglow. It's a tender
genuflection to the women's energies that keep that spinning world
from keeling over.

`SWEET AND LOWDOWN' IS APPEALING, LIGHTWEIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
SWEET AND LOWDOWN 
Written and directed by: Woody Allen 
Starring: Samantha Morton, Sean Penn, Uma Thurman, Anthony
LaPaglia, Brian Markinson, Gretchen Mol, James Urbaniak, John
Waters 
Running time: 95 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (sexual content and some substance abuse) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Woody Allen's ``Sweet and Lowdown'' is a string of riffs on the
theme _ not exactly new to his recent movies _ that living with a
genius who lives for his art is not an emotionally rewarding
proposition. Unlike Allen's last movie, ``Celebrity,'' which was
sunk by Kenneth Branagh's fatally distracting Allen impersonation,
this film's Allen surrogate is a talented jazz guitarist played by
Sean Penn as a sort of cross between ``Pal Joey'' and Kirk
Douglas's brash musician in ``Young Man With a Horn.'' Spiritually,
the film's source is Federico Fellini's ``La Strada,'' with Penn
the new version of Anthony Quinn's weak strongman, Zampano, and
Samantha Morton filling the screen as the pure-hearted mute waif
played by Giulietta Masina.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again, the film makes its point. Although Morton's
mousy, devoted Hattie can't speak, other characters appear at
regular intervals to say things like, ``I don't need a genius to
have a good time'' or ``No genius is worth too much heartache.''
Penn's Emmet Ray, who frets over being a smaller talent than Django
Reinhardt the way Allen has fretted at coming up short when
measured against Ingmar Bergman, is believably blissed-out when
he's strumming his guitar and the music is coming out the way he
hears it in his head. But while he Emmet can handle a guitar, he
can't handle anything else, especially intimacy. He talks tough,
but fools nobody. This is a frightened, damaged guy who grew up
abused in Chicago and has, emotionally speaking, been on the run
ever since.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, he isn't much fun. He drives a snazzy roadster,
but his idea of a good time on a date is to take a girl to a
garbage dump to watch him shoot rats with a .45. Partly because
he's too selfish to admit the needs of another person, partly
because he's spooked by Hattie's emotional courage and devotion, he
feels like pushing her away to preserve the safety of his
isolation. It doesn't help that when she follows him to Hollywood
for some career-furthering, it's she who stumbles into a movie
career and not Emmet. He's the kind of guy who has flings, then
flees. The question is whether he'll be able to break the pattern
and not wind up like Zampano did, alone on the beach.
</P>
<P>
   That we care as much as we do derives from the details about
Penn, as fine an actor as we have. He easily projects Emmet's cocky
side, but also covers, with a series of hesitations and darting
beady-eyed glances, the guy's fears and emotional limits. Frankly,
it's Allen who seems to fall short here because he gives us only
the surface of Emmet, never the kind of probing that would have
done more with Emmet's self-loathing. Better he should have taken
less inspiration from Zampano and more from Laurence Olivier's
seedy Archie Rice in ``The Entertainer.'' And while Morton is more
than capable of expressing Hattie's pain, Allen mutes it. The film
needs less dress-up, more X-ray.
</P>
<P>
   It's got more than a few of Allen's bright one-liners. His
well-documented love of the period means that the musical numbers
are conjured up with great gusto and affection. Not just in the
jazz, but in the film references as well. When he meets a society
woman, dipping her toe into the deliciously disreputable world of
jazz, Emmet cracks as snappily as any '30s wise guy to the world at
large: ``Take yer hat off _ she grew up with a butler.'' Allen, who
doesn't appear as a character in the movie, turns up as one of its
mock-documentary information-supplying talking heads, gently
spoofing ``Reds.'' He's tongue-in-cheek funny, bringing throwaway
humor even to such peripheral things as a passing reference to
Eddie Condon. As apologia go, ``Sweet and Lowdown'' is agreeable
eye candy and ear candy, but it's too slight to reach as deep as it
thinks it wants to reach.

ANDY KAUFMAN IS MISSING

MAN ON THE MOON 
Directed by: Milos Forman 
Screenplay by: Scott Alexander &AMP; Larry Karaszewski 
Starring: Jim Carrey, Danny DeVito, Courtney Love, Paul Giamatti 
Running time: 118 minutes 
Rated: R (language and brief sexuality/nudity) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We live in a culture of clamor. Pols, bail bondsmen, all the way
up the evolutionary ladder, everybody blasts us with the same
message: comin'-at-ya-live-baby-and-have-I-got-needs-lemme-tell-ya!
Obnoxious neurotics are everywhere, slapping a death grip on your
eyeballs in their need for attention, but nowhere are they rewarded
as handsomely as in journalism and comedy. Even so, it's hard to
posthumously crown Andy Kaufman as the king of visionary comic
geniuses, even if the major artistic business of the century has
been the mainstreaming of alienation and Kaufman was nothing if not
alienated.
</P>
<P>
   Still, between them, Jim Carrey and Milos Forman almost bring it
off in their Kaufman biopic, ``Man on the Moon.'' As he more than
amply demonstrated in ``The Truman Show'' and ``The Cable Guy,''
Carrey has been aching to break out of the comic box. ``Man on the
Moon'' is a sideways move that rides his extraordinary capacity for
mimicry and movement. Nobody can scissor his lanky body as Carrey
can. Yet his regeneration of Kaufman depends mostly on his ability
to project stiffness, to create the impression of a man as
profoundly uncomfortable in his own body as he was on ``Saturday
Night Live.''
</P>
<P>
   There's also the matter of Kaufman's fixed, manic stare. It goes
to the heart of the late comic's way of demanding our attention by
shining a spotlight on himself, then upending our expectations by
refusing to dispense the usual kinds of comedy. You've got to love
envelope-pushing, especially in the so-called arts, which are
supposed to be about envelope-pushing, about the deepening of
awareness, but usually are only about playing it safe. That Kaufman
was an original who refused to be pigeonholed made you want to
cheer. But the glum fact is that most of his comedy was, for me at
least, a turn-off.
</P>
<P>
   Who didn't like him as Latka in ``Taxi''? Using the sweet
hangdog mode, he goofed on comedians' constant bid for our
approval. But much of the rest of the time, he threw in our faces
the fundamentally aggressive nature of comedy, the fact that it's
anger with a smile. Not for nothing did so many of the classic
comics come offstage, high after a turn that had gone well, saying,
``I killed 'em!'' Long before he died of cancer at 35 in 1984,
Kaufman had pretty much killed his own career. The surreal
absurdity of his best bits was swamped by his insistence on shoving
the audience's expectations back in its own face _ an imperative
that went over the ropes when he wrestled women.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was that while he was frequently imaginative and
original and a pioneer in conceptual performance art, he just
wasn't that funny. What you felt from him a lot of the time was
old-fashioned performer's desperation. What you get from Carrey is
a superb impersonation of Kaufman. But in the symbiotic way of
films, you also are just as aware that you are watching Jim Carrey.
Thus, Kaufman's loose-cannon danger is offset by Carrey's essential
sweetness. But he isn't playing a character, he's playing an icon.
</P>
<P>
   The Kaufman Carrey gives us is easier to take than the real
thing, but less interesting. Yet the big problem with ``Man on the
Moon'' is that it settles for being a thing of surfaces. In their
scripts for ``Ed Wood'' and ``The People vs. Larry Flynt,'' Scott
Alexander and Larry Karaszewski had more success at indicating who
the person was beneath the persona. Here, it's a case of
what-you-see-is-what-you-get, and it isn't enough. The film apes
Kaufman's gambit, which was to hide an essentially shy self behind
an outrageous persona and a need to perform, even when he stops
being Mr. Nice Guy and delights in becoming his really aggressive
alter ego, Tony Clifton, the sleazy Vegas lounge type in perpetual
attack mode.
</P>
<P>
   What was he protecting? The film never probes this question
deeply. ``Man on the Moon'' asks you to accept it as hip
hagiography and not ask too many questions. Fans of Kaufman will
probably like it more than other moviegoers. The film seems
destined to convert the converted, and few others, including Carrey
fans. He doesn't really inhabit Kaufman. Rather, Carrey seems to
drape Kaufman's bizarre brand of humor over his own already
hyperkinetic persona. He's never boring. Give him that.
</P>
<P>
   Courtney Love, who performed the role of the woman in Larry
Flynt's life for Forman, returns in another strong turn as the
woman in Kaufman's. Paul Giamatti is another plus as Bob Zmuda,
Kaufman's friend and collaborator, especially in the Tony Clifton
bits. But for all the keen-edged professionalism on parade in ``Man
on the Moon,'' it remains a frustratingly opaque study. There's
something missing, namely Kaufman. Still, there's something to be
said for the prospect of a Forman fringe-figure three-pack in video
stores, flaunting his own personal powder-keg trio _ that wacky
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, pornmeister Flynt, and now Kaufman.

MARRIAGE LITE JUST WON'T CUT IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EILEEN MCNAMARA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Emancipation Proclamation made people uncomfortable. So did
women's suffrage. To say nothing of the social unease prompted by
interfaith marriages and school desegregation.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the governor of Vermont would deny same-sex couples the
right to marry for no more substantive reason than because he says
it ``makes me uncomfortable, the same as anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Forget, for a moment, that ``anybody else'' is not everybody
else. When did we begin apportioning civil rights in this country
on the basis of the citizenry's comfort level?
</P>
<P>
   The Vermont Supreme Court dropped the prospect of gay marriages
into the laps of the governor and state lawmakers this week with
its decision that homosexual couples are entitled to the same
benefits and protections as married couples. The high court left it
to legislators to design the remedy to current discriminatory
practices in such commonplace matters as insurance, medical
decisions, hospital visitation, and property division in the event
of separation.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Howard Dean says gay marriage is out of the question
but a parallel ``domestic partnership'' law might work. Sort of
marriage lite, I guess.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I am missing something, but isn't ``domestic partnership''
the definition of marriage? Why would lawmakers waste energy
creating a new civil institution when an existing one would fit the
bill nicely?
</P>
<P>
   The high court ruled that the denial of equal protection to
homosexual couples violated the Common Benefits Clause of the
Vermont Constitution, a provision beautiful in its simplicity and
clarity: ``That government is, or ought to be, instituted for the
common benefit, protection and security of the people, nation or
community, and not for the particular emolument or advantage of any
single person, family or set of persons, who are a part only of
that community.''
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that the issue of same-sex marriage ``arouses
deeply felt religious, moral and political beliefs,'' the justices
were mum on every aspect but the legal one.
</P>
<P>
   The governor and legislative leaders should do likewise and
leave the moral wrestling to the clerics and to the conscience of
their constituents. Governor Dean and Vermont lawmakers are not
being asked to make a moral judgment about same-sex couplings, only
to remedy the discrimination to which homosexual couples are now
subjected.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious solution is to extend the right to marry to gay and
lesbian couples.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic partnership proposals are no more than a political
dodge, an unconscionable sop to bigots who will tolerate
homosexuality only if it can be segregated in some parallel
universe. But gay and lesbian people do not live in a parallel
universe. They live in this one.
</P>
<P>
   Why should our brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, sons, and
daughters be relegated to faux marriages simply to appease those
who can live more easily with discrimination than they can with
discomfort?
</P>
<P>
   Why should gays and lesbians accept the second-class status
implicit in a ``separate but equal'' domestic partnership statute?
</P>
<P>
   The debate Vermont lawmakers promise to begin after the first of
the year should focus not on what religious leaders claim the Bible
commands, but on what the state's Supreme Court justices insist
that the Constitution mandates.
</P>
<P>
   No significant social change in this nation's history has been
accomplished without disrupting some deeply held beliefs. Blacks
were slaves because whites were superior. Wives were chattel
because women were weak-minded. Amending our laws in a continuing
effort to equalize the status of all Americans has not diminished
the nation; it has enhanced it.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have learned, with varying degrees of comfort, to live
with blacks and women who vote, with couples who celebrate
Christmas and Hanukkah, with schools that teach students of
different shades side by side.
</P>
<P>
   In its decision this week, the Vermont Supreme Court justices
noted they were duty-bound to consider the legal questions raised
by the two lesbian couples and two gay men who were the plaintiffs
in this case, without regard to their personal comfort. ``Our
constitutional responsibility to consider the legal merits of
issues properly before us provides no exception for the
controversial case,'' they wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The Vermont Supreme Court unlocked the door to equality for gay
and lesbian couples. Now, it is up to the governor and state
lawmakers to push it open wide.

UMASS PROGRAM IS MORE THAN A GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; AMHERST, Mass _ It was as an air force pilot in India that
University of Massachusetts student Vishan Bhatia realized the
dream of his lifetime, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided that I wanted to get into the sports industry,''
Bhatia said, sitting in a classroom in Amherst last week, providing
evidence of the bright international image of the university's
Sport Management Program.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really is no sports culture in India _ cricket is really
about all we have had,'' he said. ``But that is changing.''
</P>
<P>
   Changing enough so that IMG, the huge international sports and
event management and marketing agency headquartered in Cleveland,
has opened an office in India.
</P>
<P>
   IMG hired Bhatia when his stint as an air force pilot was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a while, they encouraged me to get some international
experience and to come to the United States,'' he said. ``When I
looked at the programs at the universities here, it became quite
obvious, almost immediately, that I should come to UMass.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sport Management Program at the University of Massachusetts
at Amherst is among the most highly regarded sports business
programs in the country, observers say. And, as Bhatia discovered,
it just might be best among the contenders: the University of
Northern Colorado, Ohio University, Ohio State University, and the
University of Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The department is almost like a feeder system for us at this
point,'' said Stuart Layne, executive vice president of marketing
and sales for the Boston Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a terrific relationship. They feed us a lot of good
young kids who become part of our internship program and, almost
exclusively, we hire from that program for our entry-level
positions.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Celtics official is equally as effusive _ if perhaps a
tinge more biased.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, UMass is used as a barometer when you talk about
sports management programs at universities around the country,''
said Wayne Levy, the Celtics' director of community relations. He
graduated from the program 12 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Massachusetts program is among the oldest.
There were only two other such programs when it was established in
1972. Even now, the university is the only one of 200 schools with
the division of study that offers a doctoral program, along with
its undergraduate and master's degrees. With 10 instructors, it has
the largest faculty in the country, if not the world, observers
say.
</P>
<P>
   More than 700 alumni are at work for professional sports
leagues, franchises, college athletic departments, and other sports
businesses, providing Bhatia and the other 480 current students
with a vast network of employment resources.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent alumni include Dennis Robinson, a vice president in
the NBA, and Jeff Price, senior director for US sponsorship and
promotions at MasterCard International, who has been the steward of
the ongoing, award-winning ``Priceless Memories'' advertising
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   And the Sport Management Program may be about to become more
heralded.
</P>
<P>
   It has created the PRISM Awards, which will draw nominees from
sports businesses across the country. PRISM is an acronym for
Professionalism, Results and Innovation in Sport Management.
</P>
<P>
   The awards, to be presented in spring or summer _ in partnership
with Chicago-based Team Marketing Report Inc., a sports business
research firm that publishes a widely disseminated newsletter _
will recognize excellence and commitment to quality management.
Eligible are professional sports leagues and franchises, including
the minor leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a multibillion-dollar industry like professional sports,
there is currently no award to recognize outstanding quality
management achievement. The PRISM Awards fill that gap,'' said Lisa
Pike Masteralexis, who 18 months ago succeeded Glenn M. Wong, a
nationally recognized expert in sports law, as department head.
Wong remains a professor in the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our long-term goal is that the PRISM Awards become to the
sport industry what the Baldrige Awards are to manufacturing,''
Masteralexis said.
</P>
<P>
   The PRISM Awards are already drawing notice for the Sport
Management Program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports marketing is getting so much more sophisticated, and I
think this award program will really give people in our industry
something to shoot for,'' said John McDonough, vice president of
marketing and broadcasting for the Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Masteralexis and other members of the faculty and staff _ as
well as the sports management students _ are hoping for a second
coup next year. They are hard at work creating the Center for the
Study of Spectator Sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us on the staff are interested in audiences and the
people that watch sports, either live on television or in person,''
Masteralexis said. ``How that works is something that is very
important. Our goal is to create a center where media and
organizations can come to us for assistance, and it gives us an
opportunity to study some of these things in more depth.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in the classroom, students say the Sport Management Program
has substance backing the new and ambitious initiatives.
Conversations with about 15 students this week in the aging Curry
Hicks Building, where the department is housed, revealed that they

 GWYNETH PALTROW: TRYING TO FORGET ABOUT HER OSCAR

 Includes black-and-white photos and color slides of Gwyneth Paltrow
with Matt Damon in a scene from ``The Talented Mr. Ripley.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Winning her first Oscar earlier this year _ for her
career-defining performance in ``Shakespeare in Love'' (1998) _ was
a dream come true for Gwyneth Paltrow.
 &HT;    But, the 27-year-old actress says, it was also something of a
nightmare.
 &HT;    As her latest film, ``The Talented Mr. Ripley,'' prepares for a
Christmas opening, Paltrow admits that she may have been too young,
or simply too new to acting and movie stardom, to cope with the
dark side of picking up the treasured best-actress statuette. She
might have been better served, she says, if she'd had more time to
develop sufficient armor to deflect the publicity onslaught that
Oscar brings in his wake.
 &HT;    Paltrow shows up for an interview at Beverly Hills' Four Seasons
hotel looking, well, thoroughly unlike Gwyneth Paltrow. I have to
look twice, actually, to make sure that it's really her.
 &HT;    Gone is the shoulder-length, golden-blonde hair that has
reminded so many of the young Grace Kelly. Instead her locks are
dark brown, colored for her role in ``Bounce,'' which she has
recently finished shooting with her on-again/off-again boyfriend,
Ben Affleck.
 &HT;    ``I think the director of `Bounce' was sick of the whole Blonde
Gwyneth person,'' she says. ``And so was I.''
 &HT;    Wearing virtually no makeup, Paltrow nevertheless looks elegant
in an ankle-length, black-leather skirt and matching top, set off
with dazzling diamond earrings which reportedly were a gift from
Affleck.
 &HT;    The timing of her Oscar was particularly unfortunate, Paltrow
says, because her life was finally beginning to settle down after
the tabloid furor over her breakup with fiance Brad Pitt. Then
along came Oscar, and the paparazzi went on red alert.
 &HT;    ``I became a prisoner in my house,'' she recalls, ``because
after a while I just didn't want to go out. One day I was driving
and the gas gauge on my car had broken, so I ran out of gas. There
are pictures of me walking down the street with a gas can, looking
for the nearest service station, and the paparazzi didn't have the
decency to give me a ride. They just wanted those demeaning
pictures.
 &HT;    ``I wanted to go hide somewhere,'' she concludes. ``I felt I
couldn't sustain all of the energy that comes with all that
attention.''
 &HT;    The whole thing was exacerbated by the fact that her acceptance
speech became fodder for late-night comedians. Not since Sally
Field's ``You like me, you really like me'' acceptance speech for
``Places in the Heart'' (l984) had so many had so much fun with so
little.
 &HT;    At the time Paltrow's father was ill, her grandfather was dying
_ he has since died, and she still can't mention his name without
tears _ and her brother was also having health problems. Not
surprisingly, the actress broke down in front of the world's
largest audience.
 &HT;    ``The nightmare about that evening was that I had one of the
most personal moments of my life in front of the whole world,'' she
says. ``I felt so terribly exposed. Of course I'd like to go back
and change some things, but that's impossible. It's there for
posterity.''
 &HT;    She reacted in the only way she knew how, by turning inward and
taking stock of her life and career.
 &HT;    ``It made me see the emptiness in everything I had achieved,''
Paltrow says. ``It's wonderful and I appreciate it, but nothing you
can buy, nothing you can do, achieve or win, no boy, no
relationship will help you retain contentedness.''
 &HT;    She plunged back into work _ a stage stint at the Williamstown
Theater Festival and several upcoming films _ determined, she says,
not to let the award affect the direction of her career.
 &HT;    ``I have been working so hard not to let it make any changes in
my life,'' the actress says. ``I still only accept roles if I want
to do them, as an artist, not because they are a potential
award-winning role.''
 &HT;    One of those roles is Marge Sherwood, the beautiful, wealthy
girlfriend of Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law) in writer/director
Anthony Minghella's ``The Talented Mr. Ripley.''
 &HT;    ``I liked Marge, she was very sweet,'' Paltrow says. ``But I
didn't understand how deep she was and how layered it all was until
I got there and started doing the film. I thought she was lighter.
I didn't realize she was so deep and warm and complicated, which is
a testament to my stupidity.''
 &HT;    Based on a Patricia Highsmith novel _ one that Minghella made
Paltrow promise not to read _ and set in 1950s Italy, the movie is
the fascinating story of Tom Ripley (Matt Damon), who is asked by a
millionaire shipbuilder to persuade his playboy son Dickie to come
home. Ripley becomes so fascinated by the lavish lifestyle Dickie
and Marge enjoy that he goes to extraordinary and disturbing
lengths to become exactly like them.
 &HT;    The film is gorgeously shot in some of Italy's most glorious
locales, and Paltrow and Law are as golden a couple as anything F.
Scott Fitzgerald ever conjured up. Which isn't too surprising,
since Minghella says he wrote the screenplay with Paltrow in mind
for the role of Marge.
 &HT;    ``She was the first person I cast,'' he says in a separate
interview. ``The character of Marge in the film _ womanly,
trusting, compassionate, a rebel in her own way _ has as much to do
with Gwyneth herself as it has to do with Patricia Highsmith's
Marge.''
 &HT;    It's a dark tale, one which some critics have suggested will be
too much for mainstream American audiences. Predictably, Paltrow
disagrees.
 &HT;    ``I think it's a very different movie,'' she admits. ``It's an
epic, Hollywood movie that is totally subversive.
 &HT;    ``But I think to say it will alienate middle America is to
underestimate those people as a moviegoing audience,'' Paltrow
adds. ``They like to be challenged as much as anyone else. Our
movie is about a very lonely, desperate person who wants to be
loved and will do anything to get that love. That's a universal
trait, that people want to get out of their own lives and inhabit
someone else's.''
 &HT;    At times, it seems, even lovely, blonde Oscar-winners feel that
urge.
 &HT;    ``I never wished I had someone else's life,'' she says
thoughtfully. ``I never wanted to be someone else _ but there were
many times when I felt really uncomfortable in my own skin.
 &HT;    ``I may have had celebrity quite quickly,'' she adds, ``but I've
had to work so hard to get respect and recognition. It's a bit like
Nicole Kidman _ she is one of the greatest actresses of her
generation, but she was never mentioned without reference to her
being Tom Cruise's wife. Until very recently, I was always
somebody's daughter or somebody's girlfriend.''
 &HT;    Paltrow's discomfort with her own success, Minghella says, shows
in her lack of confidence in her own ability and her deference to
other performers, such as ``Ripley'' co-star Cate Blanchett.
 &HT;    ``Gwyneth really underestimates herself as an actress,''
Minghella says. ``She was so in awe of Cate Blanchett, which is
deliciously ironic because everyone else knows what an incredible
actress and what a natural actress she is.''

   DRUGS-LAUNDER _ ATLANTA _ For three years, agents with the U.S.
Drug Enforcement Administration and the Internal Revenue Service
masqueraded as a metro Atlanta stock brokerage whose brokers were
willing to wink at the law to launder millions in illicit drug
profits. On Wednesday, as federal agents froze bank accounts across
the globe, the DEA announced the results of the investigation _
which has led to the seizure of an estimated $26.2 million in U.S.
currency, 3,600 kilos of cocaine, and 340 bank accounts used by
Colombian drug traffickers and the money brokers who converted
their illegal earnings into legitimate profits. The investigation
has also led to the arrest of 40 people in nine U.S. cities and two
foreign countries. Another 20 remain at large, including five
Colombian money brokers whom federal investigators have identified
as men who also traffic in illegal drugs. (Atlanta

whether contributions to a candidate from a Bob Smith and a B.
Smith from downtown Houston are from the same person,''said Fred
Lewis, executive director of Campaigns for People, an Austin
nonprofit that pushes for open government. ``It becomes even more
difficult when there are B. Smiths, R. Smiths, R.E. Smiths, Bobby
Smiths, Bob Smiths and Robert Smiths giving to hundreds of
political action committees and candidates.'' But the law says
donors' addresses must be deleted from the cyberspace reports. Now,

 HILLARY CLINTON STILL HAS TO WIN OVER `EL BARRIO' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Dec. (EDS: Filed in ``a'' and ``p'' categories.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 By STEWART M. POWELL   
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If Hillary Rodham Clinton wants to gauge the
political fallout of the Vieques controversy on her burgeoning New
York Senate campaign, all she has to do is stop for lunch at La
Fonda Boricua, a chummy walk-in luncheonette in the heart of the
Spanish-speaking neighborhoods of East Harlem known as ``El
Barrio.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's talking about Vieques,'' says Jorge Ayala, the
easy-going, Puerto Rico-born owner of the narrow, bustling
restaurant that serves 400 lunches and dinners a day to a clientele
of regulars that includes artists, teachers, lawyers, police
officers and firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   Some customers at the packed eatery on Manhattan's East 106th
Street, express anger that President Clinton has refused to order a
permanent end to military target practice on the 52-square mile
Puerto Rican island that is home to 9,300 civilians, all U.S.
citizens by birth.
</P>
<P>
   Other patrons, stirring midnight-black coffee amid lunch hour
clatter, voice fears that the White House may soon order U.S.
marshals and FBI agents to round up dozens of protesters encamped
on the bombing range and make way for the resumption of military
training that has been suspended since April.
</P>
<P>
   Many complain that the first lady has done too little to help
end an eight-month standoff between Puerto Rico and the Navy over
the future of the Vieques target range that has been used to train
every East Coast-based Navy-Marine Corps combat force since World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   The president waded into the dispute on Dec. 3 and ordered
resumption of military training on the island next spring by the
Navy-Marine Corps battle group led by the aircraft carrier USS
George Washington. Clinton gave a concession to the protesters by
limiting future combat exercises to non-explosive, inert munitions.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute between Puerto Rico and the Navy has become a
political litmus test for many in this tightly knit
Spanish-speaking community that traces its roots to Cuban and
Puerto Rican cigar workers moving into the 19th century brownstones
after World War I
</P>
<P>
   ``El Barrio'' enjoys such close ties with Puerto Rico nowadays
that residents here read the Spanish language edition of the San
Juan Star and lustily debate developments back home as though East
Harlem were just another town on the island of Puerto Rico.
Neighborhoods like these are home to many of New York state's 2.2
million Hispanics _ 1.4 million of the New Yorkers with ties to
Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody understands Vieques,'' says Antonio Martorell, 60, a
Georgetown University-educated artist who divides his time between
New York and Puerto Rico. ``Vieques is about life and death and
making a living. That's why the issue has gone so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Quinoes, 55, a retired Puerto Rico-born legal aid lawyer
with two sons, says both of the Clintons' actions on Vieques will
determine whether she supports the first lady for the U.S. Senate
in next November's election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have a very hard time voting for her for the Senate
given what the president has done,'' says Quinoes, whose husband
was arrested with nine others during peaceful civil disobedience
protest over Vieques at the United Nations on Dec. 7. ``If the
Clintons don't resolve Vieques by the time the Democratic
Convention takes place in Los Angeles next summer, we Democrats
will be there to put this issue in the platform.''
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Mark-Viverito, 30, a Puerto Rico-born New Yorker who
graduated from Columbia University, complained that Mrs. Clinton
has not followed up her public statement supporting an end to Navy
bombardment with concrete action to change White House policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What counts is what you do, not what you say,'' says
Mark-Viverito. ``She has been the president's equal partner on
policy for seven years. Now she stands idly by?''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's Dec. 3 compromise calls for the
Navy to withdraw from the island in five years, $40 million in
economic development assistance and immediate turnover of 8,000
acres of the 22,000 acres that the Navy has owned since 1941.
</P>
<P>
   The president's plan was designed to reopen the target range
that has been closed since April 19 when a Marine pilot mistakenly
targeted a range observation post with two 500 pound bombs, killing
Navy contract security guard David Sanes Rodriguez, 35, and
injuring four civilian workers on the range.
</P>
<P>
   But the White House plan has been rejected by Puerto Rico Gov.
Pedro Rossello and Puerto Rico's political allies here in New York
because they said the Clinton administration did not go far enough
and immediately end Navy bombardment of an 899-acre target range
located 10 miles from the island's civilian population.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen New York City politicians with ties to Puerto Rico, led
by Reps. Jose Serrano, D-N.Y. and Nydia Velazquez, D-N.Y., had
pointedly warned the president and the first lady beforehand that
the Clinton administration should end 58 years of Navy bombardment
or face ``potential ramifications to your administration and others
who might be seeking to carry on your policies and programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the first lady and her Republican rival, New York Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, are courting Hispanic voters in their quest to
succeed retiring Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y. Both Senate
candidates have endorsed Puerto Rico's demands for a permanent end
to military training and phased Navy withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   But New York's Hispanic politicians and some lunchtime customers
here at La Fonda Boricua say they expect more direct action from
Mrs. Clinton because of her influential role inside the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Olga Mendez, whose district includes this
neighborhood of aging brownstones, rental apartments and
multi-story public housing complexes, says the Clintons' actions on
Vieques will determine the breadth of her support for Mrs.
Clinton's Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's efforts on behalf of education, health care and a
social safety net are important, ``but Vieques ranks number one
because our people are being abused,'' says Mendez. The canny
veteran of 21 years in the New York state Senate and the longest
serving elected Puerto Rican woman politician in America adds:
``Now if Hillary influences her husband to take the Navy out of
Vieques, she will be crowned St. Hillary in Puerto Rico and New
York.''
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Efrain Gonzalez Jr., whose district includes Hispanic
neighborhoods in the Bronx, says his active support for Mrs.
Clinton's Senate campaign is ``on hold'' until he sees a favorable
resolution of the dispute over Vieques. Gonzalez adds: ``We're
staying tuned for further developments.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Wolfson, Clinton's Senate campaign spokesman, said the
first lady continues to support an immediate and permanent end to
bombing on Vieques even though she has not expressed a public
reaction to the president's announcement that military training
will resume on Vieques in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never discuss what Hillary talks about with the president,''
Wolfson said. ``But suffice it to say, she is very clearly on the
record urging an immediate and permanent halt to all bombing on the
island.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's ability to muster support from grass-roots politicians
such as Gonzalez and Mendez could make the difference in the
outcome of her high-profile Senate race. The latest public opinion
survey, a Quinnipiac College Poll completed Dec. 12, showed the
two-term GOP mayor leading the first lady 46 percent to 42 percent.
The survey had a margin of error of 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanic voters who are expected to be about 6 percent of the
vote next November could become part of the influential swing vote
that determines the outcome. The president captured 86 percent of
the Hispanic vote in New York in 1996. Rep. Charles Schumer,
D-N.Y., won 82 percent of the Hispanic vote in 1998 to oust Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   But John Zogby, head of the Utica, N.Y.,-based polling firm
Zogby International, says that the first lady does not command the
traditional margin of support among Hispanics of more than 70
percent that Democrats need to win statewide. The first lady has
averaged support from 62 percent of likely Hispanic voters over the
past year, compared to Giuliani's average of 31 percent, Zogby
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not good news for a Democrat,'' Zogby said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani won re-election as mayor in 1997 with 43 percent of the
Hispanic vote.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's hopes for capturing a greater share of the Hispanic
vote in New York may be hostage to developments on Vieques. Puerto
Rican activists vow immediate demonstrations here in New York if
the White House orders the arrest of demonstrators camped out on
the beachfront target range located on Navy-owned land on Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   Wall posters around the neighborhood urge Puerto Ricans to mass
in Times Square at first word of arrests to march through the heart
of Manhattan to the venerable aircraft carrier USS Intrepid docked
on the Hudson River as a naval museum.

</P>
<P>
   Pedro Angel Rivera, 49, a documentary film specialist and
teacher, says the headline grabbing impact of demonstrators
challenging authorities in Seattle, Wash., during the World Trade
Organization summit has not been lost on Puerto Rican activists.
``We saw 200 people smash the windows of corporate America in
Seattle and get more attention than 50,000 people marching in
Puerto Rico to demand an end to bombing on Vieques,'' Rivera said.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, who has served in the New York state Senate since
1989, warns that arrests on Vieques would be ``a thunderbolt'' for
the Puerto Rican community in New York, adding: ``My advice would
be, `Don't push it.'''

 HILLARY CLINTON STILL HAS TO WIN OVER `EL BARRIO' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Dec. (EDS: Filed in ``a'' and ``p'' categories.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 By STEWART M. POWELL   
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If Hillary Rodham Clinton wants to gauge the
political fallout of the Vieques controversy on her burgeoning New
York Senate campaign, all she has to do is stop for lunch at La
Fonda Boricua, a chummy walk-in luncheonette in the heart of the
Spanish-speaking neighborhoods of East Harlem known as ``El
Barrio.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's talking about Vieques,'' says Jorge Ayala, the
easy-going, Puerto Rico-born owner of the narrow, bustling
restaurant that serves 400 lunches and dinners a day to a clientele
of regulars that includes artists, teachers, lawyers, police
officers and firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   Some customers at the packed eatery on Manhattan's East 106th
Street, express anger that President Clinton has refused to order a
permanent end to military target practice on the 52-square mile
Puerto Rican island that is home to 9,300 civilians, all U.S.
citizens by birth.
</P>
<P>
   Other patrons, stirring midnight-black coffee amid lunch hour
clatter, voice fears that the White House may soon order U.S.
marshals and FBI agents to round up dozens of protesters encamped
on the bombing range and make way for the resumption of military
training that has been suspended since April.
</P>
<P>
   Many complain that the first lady has done too little to help
end an eight-month standoff between Puerto Rico and the Navy over
the future of the Vieques target range that has been used to train
every East Coast-based Navy-Marine Corps combat force since World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   The president waded into the dispute on Dec. 3 and ordered
resumption of military training on the island next spring by the
Navy-Marine Corps battle group led by the aircraft carrier USS
George Washington. Clinton gave a concession to the protesters by
limiting future combat exercises to non-explosive, inert munitions.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute between Puerto Rico and the Navy has become a
political litmus test for many in this tightly knit
Spanish-speaking community that traces its roots to Cuban and
Puerto Rican cigar workers moving into the 19th century brownstones
after World War I
</P>
<P>
   ``El Barrio'' enjoys such close ties with Puerto Rico nowadays
that residents here read the Spanish language edition of the San
Juan Star and lustily debate developments back home as though East
Harlem were just another town on the island of Puerto Rico.
Neighborhoods like these are home to many of New York state's 2.2
million Hispanics _ 1.4 million of the New Yorkers with ties to
Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody understands Vieques,'' says Antonio Martorell, 60, a
Georgetown University-educated artist who divides his time between
New York and Puerto Rico. ``Vieques is about life and death and
making a living. That's why the issue has gone so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Quinones, 55, a retired Puerto Rico-born legal aid lawyer
with two sons, says both of the Clintons' actions on Vieques will
determine whether she supports the first lady for the U.S. Senate
in next November's election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have a very hard time voting for her for the Senate
given what the president has done,'' says Quinones, whose husband
was arrested with nine others during peaceful civil disobedience
protest over Vieques at the United Nations on Dec. 7. ``If the
Clintons don't resolve Vieques by the time the Democratic
Convention takes place in Los Angeles next summer, we Democrats
will be there to put this issue in the platform.''
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Mark-Viverito, 30, a Puerto Rico-born New Yorker who
graduated from Columbia University, complained that Mrs. Clinton
has not followed up her public statement supporting an end to Navy
bombardment with concrete action to change White House policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What counts is what you do, not what you say,'' says
Mark-Viverito. ``She has been the president's equal partner on
policy for seven years. Now she stands idly by?''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's Dec. 3 compromise calls for the
Navy to withdraw from the island in five years, $40 million in
economic development assistance and immediate turnover of 8,000
acres of the 22,000 acres that the Navy has owned since 1941.
</P>
<P>
   The president's plan was designed to reopen the target range
that has been closed since April 19 when a Marine pilot mistakenly
targeted a range observation post with two 500 pound bombs, killing
Navy contract security guard David Sanes Rodriguez, 35, and
injuring four civilian workers on the range.
</P>
<P>
   But the White House plan has been rejected by Puerto Rico Gov.
Pedro Rossello and Puerto Rico's political allies here in New York
because they said the Clinton administration did not go far enough
and immediately end Navy bombardment of an 899-acre target range
located 10 miles from the island's civilian population.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen New York City politicians with ties to Puerto Rico, led
by Reps. Jose Serrano, D-N.Y. and Nydia Velazquez, D-N.Y., had
pointedly warned the president and the first lady beforehand that
the Clinton administration should end 58 years of Navy bombardment
or face ``potential ramifications to your administration and others
who might be seeking to carry on your policies and programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the first lady and her Republican rival, New York Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, are courting Hispanic voters in their quest to
succeed retiring Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y. Both Senate
candidates have endorsed Puerto Rico's demands for a permanent end
to military training and phased Navy withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   But New York's Hispanic politicians and some lunchtime customers
here at La Fonda Boricua say they expect more direct action from
Mrs. Clinton because of her influential role inside the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Olga Mendez, whose district includes this
neighborhood of aging brownstones, rental apartments and
multi-story public housing complexes, says the Clintons' actions on
Vieques will determine the breadth of her support for Mrs.
Clinton's Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's efforts on behalf of education, health care and a
social safety net are important, ``but Vieques ranks number one
because our people are being abused,'' says Mendez. The canny
veteran of 21 years in the New York state Senate and the longest
serving elected Puerto Rican woman politician in America adds:
``Now if Hillary influences her husband to take the Navy out of
Vieques, she will be crowned St. Hillary in Puerto Rico and New
York.''
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Efrain Gonzalez Jr., whose district includes Hispanic
neighborhoods in the Bronx, says his active support for Mrs.
Clinton's Senate campaign is ``on hold'' until he sees a favorable
resolution of the dispute over Vieques. Gonzalez adds: ``We're
staying tuned for further developments.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Wolfson, Clinton's Senate campaign spokesman, said the
first lady continues to support an immediate and permanent end to
bombing on Vieques even though she has not expressed a public
reaction to the president's announcement that military training
will resume on Vieques in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never discuss what Hillary talks about with the president,''
Wolfson said. ``But suffice it to say, she is very clearly on the
record urging an immediate and permanent halt to all bombing on the
island.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's ability to muster support from grass-roots politicians
such as Gonzalez and Mendez could make the difference in the
outcome of her high-profile Senate race. The latest public opinion
survey, a Quinnipiac College Poll completed Dec. 12, showed the
two-term GOP mayor leading the first lady 46 percent to 42 percent.
The survey had a margin of error of 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanic voters who are expected to be about 6 percent of the
vote next November could become part of the influential swing vote
that determines the outcome. The president captured 86 percent of
the Hispanic vote in New York in 1996. Rep. Charles Schumer,
D-N.Y., won 82 percent of the Hispanic vote in 1998 to oust Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   But John Zogby, head of the Utica, N.Y.,-based polling firm
Zogby International, says that the first lady does not command the
traditional margin of support among Hispanics of more than 70
percent that Democrats need to win statewide. The first lady has
averaged support from 62 percent of likely Hispanic voters over the
past year, compared to Giuliani's average of 31 percent, Zogby
said.

OLIVER STONE DROPS THE BALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Director Oliver Stone, after waging the Vietnam War (''Platoon''
and ``Born on the Fourth of July''), solving the JFK assassination
(''JFK'') and somehow associating J.R. Ewing with the Nixon scandal
(Larry Hagman has a cameo as a powerful Texas oilman in ``Nixon''),
now has the NFL in his cross hairs with ``Any Given Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sunday'' must be the first almost-three-hour-long movie
directed by a man with attention-deficit disorder: Mr. Stone's Wild
Ride. (It looks as if it was edited with a remote control _ a
zapper _ because it can barely remain in place for one shot, let
alone an entire scene.) And there's enough noise and insanity going
on to make you think that the games are played in South Park
Stadium. The leaking testosterone from any Stone movie could power
one football game; there's enough of the stuff splashing around in
``Sunday'' to fuel the entire playoff season.
</P>
<P>
   The Stone theme of father/son relationships weighs heavily here,
too. But this time, it's more about the father than the son, or for
that matter, the daughter. Al Pacino is the father figure, Miami
Shark coach Tony D'Amato, whose better days are long behind him.
His star quarterback, Jack ``Cap'' Rooney (Dennis Quaid), who seems
to be held together with Bubble Yum and Popsicle sticks, takes a
piledriver hit that knocks onto him the injured list for a long
time. D'Amato is forced to go to a third-string quarterback, Willie
Beaman (Jamie Foxx), who's so nervous that his lunch hits the field
before he does.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sunday'' is about age resisting giving up the stage to youth,
so it has a startling amount of drive and ambition. Stone works
like a much younger man, someone who still has something to prove.
(Stone turns in a cameo as a vain TV commentator with a mess of
curls that makes him look as if he's wearing the Big Boy's
hairpiece. And, surprisingly, he has an intimate, calm voice.) The
movie is so busy it's as if Stone doesn't trust himself _ or his
audience _ to follow a leaner, more precise story. A number of
scenes have so much going on with background noise, music and sound
effects that you can't quite tell what's happening.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, ``Sunday'' is so full of movement and crosscutting that
it's like ``NFL on Fox _ the Motion Picture.'' Stone oversimplifies
the story the way that Fox Sports does its athletes' profiles. The
Sharks' owner (Cameron Diaz) is part of a dynasty _ her dad was the
first owner and D'Amato's friend. She's determined to show that she
belongs in the game as much as any man, giving Stone a chance to
make a muddle of the sexism in the game as well. She goes
nose-to-nose with D'Amato, who, like any Stone hero, is fiercely
loyal. He's his own man, although being his own man leads D'Amato
to back the right guy, Beaman, who becomes a star by making up his
own plays. And as Beaman puffs up, so does his head: He abandons
his girlfriend and alienates himself from the other players.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to dramatizing the schism between the young and the
old _ Diaz has her eye on an assistant coach (Aaron Eckhart) she
wants to replace D'Amato with _ Stone addresses the takeover by
African-Americans of the athletic culture and pop culture, which
has left many whites feeling old and out of it. Or he tries. While
watching a hilariously lame hip-hop video starring Beaman _ it
sounds like the B-side of ``Super Bowl Shuffle'' _ D'Amato mutters
something about needing a translator.
</P>
<P>
   Stone returns to the Miami that was the setting of his
``Scarface'' script, a movie that bought him heavy props from the
hip-hop community; Stone's out to return the favor by using more
black culture than he ever has before. Besides Foxx _ who, as a pro
football player, looks like he's 3/4-scale _ ``Sunday'' features
Bill Bellamy, who also lacks stature and looks as if he should be
playing in the Canadian Football League; Jim Brown as an assistant
coach; LL Cool J as a wide receiver out to take care of himself and
no one else; and Lawrence Taylor, LT himself, who holds his own
with the other actors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sunday'' may sprawl, but it doesn't linger. Stone apparently
thinks he's saying something new: that pro football, like every
other major American institution, is corrupt. Even the team doctor
(James Woods) is morally bankrupt. Evidently, Stone doesn't get
ESPN or ``Sports Illustrated,'' where this stuff comes up all the
time. And I guess he's never seen (or read the novel) ``North
Dallas Forty,'' a much better movie on the same subject.
</P>
<P>
   The movie seems terribly dated, especially now that NFL wide
receiver Rae Carruth is charged with murdering his girlfriend, a
truly sad indication of the lack of responsibility that pro
athletes feel _ men who've been treated like royalty capable of
doing no wrong. (Yet, Stone's vigor and his eyes-wide-open take on
football clearly cost ``Any Given Sunday'' any NFL cooperation. As
a result, the uniforms and logos look as if they were designed by
Pier 1.) Yet the athletes' _ and the uniforms' _ disconnection from
the real world is appropriate for this movie, because ``Any Given
Sunday'' takes place on no planet in this galaxy.

HILLARY CLINTON STILL HAS TO WIN OVER `EL BARRIO'

 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If Hillary Rodham Clinton wants to gauge the
political fallout of the Vieques controversy on her burgeoning New
York Senate campaign, all she has to do is stop for lunch at La
Fonda Boricua, a chummy walk-in luncheonette in the heart of the
Spanish-speaking neighborhoods of East Harlem known as ``El
Barrio.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's talking about Vieques,'' says Jorge Ayala, the
easy-going, Puerto Rico-born owner of the narrow, bustling
restaurant that serves 400 lunches and dinners a day to a clientele
of regulars that includes artists, teachers, lawyers, police
officers and firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   Some customers at the packed eatery on Manhattan's East 106th
Street, express anger that President Clinton has refused to order a
permanent end to military target practice on the 52-square mile
Puerto Rican island that is home to 9,300 civilians, all U.S.
citizens by birth.
</P>
<P>
   Other patrons, stirring midnight-black coffee amid lunch hour
clatter, voice fears that the White House may soon order U.S.
marshals and FBI agents to round up dozens of protesters encamped
on the bombing range and make way for the resumption of military
training that has been suspended since April.
</P>
<P>
   Many complain that the first lady has done too little to help
end an eight-month standoff between Puerto Rico and the Navy over
the future of the Vieques target range that has been used to train
every East Coast-based Navy-Marine Corps combat force since World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   The president waded into the dispute on Dec. 3 and ordered
resumption of military training on the island next spring by the
Navy-Marine Corps battle group led by the aircraft carrier USS
George Washington. Clinton gave a concession to the protesters by
limiting future combat exercises to non-explosive, inert munitions.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute between Puerto Rico and the Navy has become a
political litmus test for many in this tightly knit
Spanish-speaking community that traces its roots to Cuban and
Puerto Rican cigar workers moving into the 19th century brownstones
after World War I
</P>
<P>
   ``El Barrio'' enjoys such close ties with Puerto Rico nowadays
that residents here read the Spanish language edition of the San
Juan Star and lustily debate developments back home as though East
Harlem were just another town on the island of Puerto Rico.
Neighborhoods like these are home to many of New York state's 2.2
million Hispanics _ 1.4 million of the New Yorkers with ties to
Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody understands Vieques,'' says Antonio Martorell, 60, a
Georgetown University-educated artist who divides his time between
New York and Puerto Rico. ``Vieques is about life and death and
making a living. That's why the issue has gone so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Quinones, 55, a retired Puerto Rico-born legal aid lawyer
with two sons, says both of the Clintons' actions on Vieques will
determine whether she supports the first lady for the U.S. Senate
in next November's election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have a very hard time voting for her for the Senate
given what the president has done,'' says Quinones, whose husband
was arrested with nine others during peaceful civil disobedience
protest over Vieques at the United Nations on Dec. 7. ``If the
Clintons don't resolve Vieques by the time the Democratic
Convention takes place in Los Angeles next summer, we Democrats
will be there to put this issue in the platform.''
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Mark-Viverito, 30, a Puerto Rico-born New Yorker who
graduated from Columbia University, complained that Mrs. Clinton
has not followed up her public statement supporting an end to Navy
bombardment with concrete action to change White House policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What counts is what you do, not what you say,'' says
Mark-Viverito. ``She has been the president's equal partner on
policy for seven years. Now she stands idly by?''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's Dec. 3 compromise calls for the
Navy to withdraw from the island in five years, $40 million in
economic development assistance and immediate turnover of 8,000
acres of the 22,000 acres that the Navy has owned since 1941.
</P>
<P>
   The president's plan was designed to reopen the target range
that has been closed since April 19 when a Marine pilot mistakenly
targeted a range observation post with two 500 pound bombs, killing
Navy contract security guard David Sanes Rodriguez, 35, and
injuring four civilian workers on the range.
</P>
<P>
   But the White House plan has been rejected by Puerto Rico Gov.
Pedro Rossello and Puerto Rico's political allies here in New York
because they said the Clinton administration did not go far enough
and immediately end Navy bombardment of an 899-acre target range
located 10 miles from the island's civilian population.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen New York City politicians with ties to Puerto Rico, led
by Reps. Jose Serrano, D-N.Y. and Nydia Velazquez, D-N.Y., had
pointedly warned the president and the first lady beforehand that
the Clinton administration should end 58 years of Navy bombardment
or face ``potential ramifications to your administration and others
who might be seeking to carry on your policies and programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the first lady and her Republican rival, New York Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, are courting Hispanic voters in their quest to
succeed retiring Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y. Both Senate
candidates have endorsed Puerto Rico's demands for a permanent end
to military training and phased Navy withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   But New York's Hispanic politicians and some lunchtime customers
here at La Fonda Boricua say they expect more direct action from
Mrs. Clinton because of her influential role inside the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Olga Mendez, whose district includes this
neighborhood of aging brownstones, rental apartments and
multi-story public housing complexes, says the Clintons' actions on
Vieques will determine the breadth of her support for Mrs.
Clinton's Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's efforts on behalf of education, health care and a
social safety net are important, ``but Vieques ranks number one
because our people are being abused,'' says Mendez. The canny
veteran of 21 years in the New York state Senate and the longest
serving elected Puerto Rican woman politician in America adds:
``Now if Hillary influences her husband to take the Navy out of
Vieques, she will be crowned St. Hillary in Puerto Rico and New
York.''
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Efrain Gonzalez Jr., whose district includes Hispanic
neighborhoods in the Bronx, says his active support for Mrs.
Clinton's Senate campaign is ``on hold'' until he sees a favorable
resolution of the dispute over Vieques. Gonzalez adds: ``We're
staying tuned for further developments.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Wolfson, Clinton's Senate campaign spokesman, said the
first lady continues to support an immediate and permanent end to
bombing on Vieques even though she has not expressed a public
reaction to the president's announcement that military training
will resume on Vieques in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never discuss what Hillary talks about with the president,''
Wolfson said. ``But suffice it to say, she is very clearly on the
record urging an immediate and permanent halt to all bombing on the
island.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's ability to muster support from grass-roots politicians
such as Gonzalez and Mendez could make the difference in the
outcome of her high-profile Senate race. The latest public opinion
survey, a Quinnipiac College Poll completed Dec. 12, showed the
two-term GOP mayor leading the first lady 46 percent to 42 percent.
The survey had a margin of error of 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanic voters who are expected to be about 6 percent of the
vote next November could become part of the influential swing vote
that determines the outcome. The president captured 86 percent of
the Hispanic vote in New York in 1996. Rep. Charles Schumer,
D-N.Y., won 82 percent of the Hispanic vote in 1998 to oust Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   But John Zogby, head of the Utica, N.Y.,-based polling firm
Zogby International, says that the first lady does not command the
traditional margin of support among Hispanics of more than 70
percent that Democrats need to win statewide. The first lady has
averaged support from 62 percent of likely Hispanic voters over the
past year, compared to Giuliani's average of 31 percent, Zogby
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not good news for a Democrat,'' Zogby said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani won re-election as mayor in 1997 with 43 percent of the
Hispanic vote.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's hopes for capturing a greater share of the Hispanic
vote in New York may be hostage to developments on Vieques. Puerto

`DINER' DIRECTOR MINES QUESTIONS OF RACE, CLASS AND JEWISH
EXPERIENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Director Barry Levinson continues his onscreen love affair with
1950s Baltimore, his hometown, in ``Liberty Heights.'' The love
affair began with ``Diner,'' still his best picture, and continued
on through ``Tin Men'' and ``Avalon.'' (The Fells Point Diner from
``Diner'' makes a cameo here.) Levinson, however, has become more
and more imperial as a director.
</P>
<P>
   ``Liberty Heights'' feels like a gorgeously made David Lean
movie about the Jewish Experience in America, right down to the
casting of the blond, snub-nosed kid (Ben Foster) who plays the
young protagonist who doesn't resemble anyone in his family. Joe
Mantegna is the father, who owns a dying burlesque house to hide
his real business as a numbers runner. He does well enough to keep
his family in a solid middle-class existence. Adrien Brody is the
oldest brother, who chases an unattainable blond WASP so damaged
that she was probably cut from the first draft of a Philip Roth
novel. And Bebe Neuwirth, who looks like a million dollars, is the
mother.
</P>
<P>
   Any of the various plot lines of ``Heights'' has enough dramatic
impact to make a movie. The movie's best moments have a comic
insolence, enough to make you wish Levinson would submit to those
impulses and make a comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Foster and his friends encounter a public pool with a sign
saying the pool excludes ``Jews, Coloreds and Dogs,'' and they riff
about the order. At a party in one of the tony WASP homes, one of
Brody's pals muses, after walking past all the antiques, that the
rich don't have taste enough to buy something new. It's the anger
that registers, but Levinson is so wrapped up in his reverie that
he can't play to his strengths.
</P>
<P>
   One subplot involves Foster's crush on a young African-American
girl. It upsets his parents _ ``Kill me now,'' his mother shrieks _
and the girl's father, a doctor, also thinks romantic contact is
inappropriate. This is an aspect of black life not seen onscreen,
the fact that middle-class blacks shied also away from integration,
and for reasons much different than those of whites. But Levinson
uses his white-glove manner to dramatize it. And the crush seems
bloodless, like something that belongs at the Smithsonian.
</P>
<P>
   There's another race-based subplot; Mantegna gets involved with
black numbers runner Little Melvin in a deal that goes bad, that is
so clumsily handled that it becomes inadvertently racist. When
circumstances lead to arrests, and it's suggested that the cops are
so happy to bust a white man that they let a black man go _ and in
Baltimore, which is essentially a Southern town _ you wonder what
has come over Levinson.
</P>
<P>
   Even Levinson's love of pop music isn't enough to keep
``Heights'' going. There's a scene in which Foster and his friend
go to a James Brown show. Only the James Brown looks like Heavy D
squeezed into one of Cab Calloway's rhinestone tuxedos from ``The
Blues Brothers.'' (As a kid, I saw Brown _ he was in such constant,
beautifully coordinated motion that he seemed to be 2 inches off
the ground at all times, even when he did those drop-splits.) In
the end, it's just another opportunity that the movie squanders.
``Liberty Heights'' is another of Levinson's end-of-an-era movies.
He's made so many elegies to the past that he's become a funeral
director, and this is an exquisite corpse.

&HT;     DREW CARREY EARNS HIS STRIPES IN `MAN ON THE MOON' 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK McGUIRE  
 &HT;     c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fifteen years dead and gone _ well, presumably dead anyway _ and
Andy Kaufman gets to play one more joke on us.
</P>
<P>
   It comes at the very end of ``Man on the Moon,'' as the closing
credits roll (for the second time). Instead of gathering coats and
beating traffic, you are compelled to remain, half-turned in the
aisle and eyes on the screen, scanning the names of the second unit
director and the key grip and the ASPCA disclaimer. There may be
one last gag to be played, one more joke on you, and you are not
going to be a patsy.
</P>
<P>
   No, you are not going to let Andy Kaufman get you.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Man on the Moon'' will get you, almost as much as Jim
Carrey, in the title role, gets Andy Kaufman. As Tom Hanks buried
his ``Bachelor Party''/``Money Pit''/``Joe Versus the Volcano''
past to become the most seriously bankable actor in film, Carrey
has laid to rest ``Ace Ventura.'' Carrey, who showcased his
developing talent in ``The Truman Show,'' unequivocally must be
taken seriously, now. Oscar-seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Simply, Carrey is better than the movie _ and still the movie is
a captivating psychological study of what exactly constitutes art,
or at least performance art, and an artist.
</P>
<P>
   That said, there is no Jim Carrey in this movie. You concede
that Carrey is Kaufman rather than playing him, from the moment he
appears in the opening scene, in Kaufman's Foreign Man character,
decrying the ``stupid'' movie to follow. ``I don't even like it,''
he says, before putting the needle down on a 45 rpm record on his
Ultratone and ordering the closing credits to roll (for the first
time).
</P>
<P>
   ``Man on the Moon'' (the title comes from a reverential 1993
song about Kaufman by REM, whose music permeates the movie) is at
times sad, often uncomfortable and more than a little bit
disturbing _ what is the line between individual genius and plain
nuts? _ just as Kaufman himself was to watch. Meanwhile Kaufman's
alter ego, the hyper-noxious lounge lizard Tony Clifton (Carrey
approached the movie as if it were two roles), may have been the
single most unfunny, unnerving and unpalatable character created
since, well, anyone played by Fran Drescher.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, this is no comedy, although humor subversive and
otherwise abounds. Kaufman and his sidekick/writer Bob Zmuda (Paul
Giamatti, deservedly one of the hottest character actors in
Hollywood) do their best to disrupt, annoy, challenge and _ if it
emerges as a byproduct _ entertain the people and institutions
around them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it an act or are you just addicted to causing trouble?''
asks Kaufman's girlfriend Lynne Margulies (the improving grunge
rocker/actress Courtney Love).
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman considered himself a song-and-dance man, abhorring any
characterization of him being a comic. ``I'm not a comedian,''
Kaufman tells his agent, George Shapiro (Danny DeVito) in the
movie. ``I don't do jokes. I don't even know what is funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Director Milos Forman has earned a living _ and Oscars _ by
profiling on-the-edge iconoclasts, whether they be a porn peddler
(``The People vs. Larry Flynt'') or composer (Mozart in
``Amadeus'') or provocateur (McMurphy in ``One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest''). Forman plays games with some chronology (like the
timeline for Kaufman's famed Carnegie Hall concert, after which he
took the entire audience out for milk and cookies), but more
importantly he toys with the filmgoer.
</P>
<P>
   Giving equal evidence without drawing conclusions, Forman leaves
it up to you to conclude whether Kaufman was a trailblazer who was
grossly misunderstood, or if there was a reason why no one before
did what he did: He was just being a jerk.
</P>
<P>
   As a lonely kid growing up on Long Island, Kaufman was putting
on shows for no one, his crowd consisting of the plaster walls of
his bedroom. ``If you want to perform you have to have an
audience,'' his father tells him. But in many ways throughout his
career the bug-eyed yet expressionless Kaufman still performed for
himself (and Zmuda and later Margulies). His were inside gags
played out in front of a national audience.
</P>
<P>
   But Kaufman did need the crowd _ more specifically, their
reaction. He didn't quite care what that reaction was _ adulation,
revulsion, loathing _ so long as it wasn't apathy. ``I want the
audience to go through an experience,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The whole Foreign Man _ originally from Caspiar, a small island
in the Caspian Sea; it sank _ served as the basis for his Latka
Gravas ``Taxi'' character. Kaufman hated ``Taxi,'' and did his best
to subvert his presence on it.
</P>
<P>
   (Every major cast member from the sitcom save Tony Danza makes
cameos in the movie. Well, Danza and DeVito. DeVito as his Louie
DePalma ``Taxi'' character doesn't appear, because DeVito plays
agent Shapiro, and that double-exposure would be too _ what? _
Kaufmanesque?)
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a major portion of the film is devoted to Kaufman's _
here is that word again _ bizarre career move to wrestle ... women.
It backfired: (A.) the public hated it, and him; and (B.) when he
went into the ring against professional wrestler Jerry Lawler, he
almost got his neck snapped.
</P>
<P>
   Still, what the movie does not achieve is maybe the most basic
question of a biopic, yet one that in this case always will remain
unanswerable: Who was Andy Kaufman, the real Andy Kaufman?
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know the real me,'' Kaufman pines to Margulies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't a real you,'' she replies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah. I forgot.''
</P>
<P>
   With Kaufman, the act blurred reality, and reality blurred the
act. When he breaks the news that he has lung cancer, a disease
that would take his life at age 35, his friends are unsure whether
it is just another bit. His family, on the other hand, is
thoroughly convinced he is putting them on. The movie's finale
leaves the door of ambiguity slightly ajar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man on the Moon'' is a serious look at an absurd man who is
brought back to life by an absurd actor who now must be taken
seriously. Andy Kaufman was the naive cynic, wanting life to all be
an act, unable to comprehend the reality resulting from his
make-believe. Could it be that in the end the joke was really on
Kaufman?

ALMODOVAR'S `MOTHER' SUPERIOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Writer-director Pedro Almodovar's newest film, ``All About My
Mother,'' is one of the year's best. With it, he continues with
streak he started with last year's ``Live Flesh,'' a welcome return
to form that wasn't as groundbreaking as his earlier work _ which
included ``Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown'' and ``Law of
Desire'' _ but was arresting nonetheless. His new melodrama _
heartbreak staged by a diva set in Almodovar's world of innocents,
drag queens and drug addicts _ is uniquely energetic and cinematic.
</P>
<P>
   The plot lines are like a line from the song ``Once in a
Lifetime'': ``Here comes the twister.'' Manuela (Cecilia Roth)
lives through the worst tragedy a parent can endure: the death of
her son. He's hit by a car while chasing down the star (Marisa
Paredes) of ``A Streetcar Named Desire'' for an autograph. The
boy's father is a transvestite dying of AIDS, and the father has
recently conceived a child with a nun (the luscious but opaque
Penelope Cruz).
</P>
<P>
   After suffering the loss of her son and discovering in his
journals that all he ever wanted was a relationship with his
father, Manuela gives herself over to being a mother, to fill the
void in her life. She becomes caretaker to the nun and the junkie
``Streetcar'' star. ``Mother'' is really a tribute to mothers, and
to people who lead their lives like entertainers. Almodovar's
instincts are too generous to just make audiences suffer.
</P>
<P>
   He's as much a born entertainer as the characters who populate
his work. His characters are linked by sex or blood, a chemistry
that gives his movies their unique humidity _ and humor; no one is
as fearless about laughter through tears as Almodovar. And no
director loves actresses more; this movie is a sophisticated,
intelligent showcase. Roth and Paredes are simply wonderful, and he
serves up Cruz on a platter, although she's charismatic here
because she's more comfortable with Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Our reactions to Almodovar have been tempered by time. What he
was doing in his early work, turning the ripe melodrama of Douglas
Sirk (director of ``Written on the Wind'' and ``Imitation of
Life'') and yes, Tennessee Williams, into a flamboyant emotional
cabaret was so new and exciting that he created a hunger. It was a
demand for the literally colorful brand of slapstick soap opera
that he became less capable of filling after the peak of
``Breakdown.'' This new period, which includes ``Live Flesh,'' and
the grand allusions of ``All About My Mother,'' for which he won
the best director prize at Cannes, is a much-needed second wind,
for Almodovar and his audiences.

</P>
<P>
   DUBBELDAM-ARCHITECTURE (New York) _ Clients willing to indulge
the futuristic whims of architects are notoriously rare. But Winka
Dubbeldam, a 35-year-old Dutch-born architect based in Manhattan,
seems to have a knack for attracting patrons susceptible to her
visual poetry: the passion of a former sculptor for combining
natural materials to achieve novel effects. Among her fans, the
famously demanding architect Peter Eisenman called her ``a very
talented, highly energetic and motivated person. She's the pulse of
the moment,'' he added. By Christopher Mason.

   KEEPING-HOUSE (Undated) _ I grew up with a mother who baked
bread, ironed everything from sheets to jeans, vacuumed the carpet
in straight lines, and cleaned the entire house the night before
our cleaning person came. The running joke among my friends was,
``At the Hessers' house, you do cry over spilled milk.'' So it was
with both curiosity and skepticism that I picked up Cheryl
Mendelson's wildly comprehensive, 884-page manual, ``Home Comforts:
The Art and Science of Keeping House'' (Scribner, $35). In it, Ms.
Mendelson covers everything from dusting techniques to bleach
expiration dates. By Amanda Hesser.
</P>
<P>
   LAPIDUS-ARCHITECTURE (Miami) _ In the early 1990s, after his
wife's death, the legendary architect Morris Lapidus found himself
staring at a calendar white with blank dates. The designer of
Miami's Fontainebleau and Eden Roc hotels, Lapidus, then in his
early 90s, had retired from active practice and was sitting alone
in his ocean-front duplex, bored. In 1994, after serving on a
review panel for work by Miami architecture students, he had lunch
with a fellow juror, Deborah Desilets, and more lunches. ``He was
so removed from professional life,'' she said. ``I realized that he
had so much to give that it would be a shame not to find some way
to make it happen.'' Eventually they formed an informal
partnership, taking him from deep retirement to shallow retirement.
Now, at 97, he is back in business, sketching. By Joseph
Giovannini.

&HT;     REFORM ADVOCATES SAY NEW YORK LOBBYING MEASURE FALLS SHORT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JAMES M. ODATO  
 &HT;     c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Falling short of the strong measures desired by
government reform advocates, the state Assembly and Gov. George
Pataki agreed on a tougher lobbying law late Tuesday that would
give the state more muscle without taking away a public officer's
ability to accept free meals.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the gift-ban bill passed last week by the Senate, the
Assembly measure would allow lobbyists to bestow gifts of up to $75
on public officials. But it would severely penalize the lobbyists
for breaking the gift limit or for falsely reporting lobbying
activities.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Senate Republicans' bill, the Assembly measure would
not ban fund-raising in the Capital Region during the legislative
session. Nor does it extend to lobbying of state agencies, a
provision desired by the current lobbying oversight commission.
Assembly aides said fund-raising may be addressed in a campaign
finance bill that would be introduced next year.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of revamping the system said they would continue to
fight for broader reforms, particularly gift bans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the stuff in the proposal is quite good. The thing
that's stunning is that it doesn't do anything about gifts and it
doesn't include state agencies,'' said Blair Horner, legislative
director of the New York Public Interest Research Group.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, the bill leaves New York without a law _ since the
Senate needs to sign on _ and the current law, authorizing the New
York Temporary State Commission on Lobbying, is set to expire in 10
days.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, a Republican from
Brunswick, may change that. He said late Tuesday that he would
bring his house back next week to vote on the Health Care Reform
Act. At that time he will discuss the Assembly lobbying bill with
his conference, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no agreement ... to act on this bill,'' he warned.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly bill represents a first, according the Assembly
aides, in that Pataki, a Republican; Assembly Speaker Sheldon
Silver, a Democrat; and the Assembly's Republican leader, John
Faso, endorsed the same measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legislation before us achieves real and meaningful
reform,'' said Silver, who is from Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly bill would largely give the commission what it has
been seeking, greater regulatory power. But it would extend the
commission for eight years rather than make it permanent.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal targets lobbyist activity rather than public
officials and legislators, who must respond to complaints of
misbehavior before ethics boards that have been criticized by good
government groups for failing to investigate complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would authorize the commission to do random audits of
lobbyists to see if they are reporting all of their activities.
</P>
<P>
   It also would require lobbyists to disclose lobbying of local
governments _ not just state government _ for communities greater
than 50,000 in population.
</P>
<P>
   If a lobbyist gave sports tickets or paid for meals valued at
more than $75, he or she would be subject to a civil penalty and
face a Class A misdemeanor. Fines would rise five times to $25,000
per violation. If the lobbyist commits the violation a second time
within five years of the first infraction, the lobbyist would face
a Class E felony charge.
</P>
<P>
   Filing fraudulent documents would carry a $50,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyists would be required to file reports with the commission
on a bimonthly basis _ twice as frequently as current law.
Lobbyists' clients would have to do semi-annual, rather than
annual, filings.
</P>
<P>
   So the state could more easily track their activities, lobbyists
would have to disclose the numbers of bills they are lobbying for
or against, and the proposed rule or rate cases they are lobbying.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill also banned gifts, with the exception of some
items _ finger food, drinks or baseball caps, for instance _ valued
up to $25.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly bill failed to achieve some priorities of
government reform advocates who wanted gifts banned and
fund-raising outlawed in the legislative session. Yet the local
government lobbying disclosures and random audits in the bill were
among the items desired by the groups.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbying reform has become a hot topic in recent weeks because
of the impending expiration of the current law and because of
substantial publicity involving the wining and dining of public
officials by the chief lobbyist for the Philip Morris Cos. The
tobacco lobbyist also admitted filing inaccurate and false
disclosure forms to the state, resulting in a $75,000 fine against
the company and a $15,000 fine and three-year lobbying ban against
the lobbyist, Sharon Portnoy.

   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (RESENDING THIS ROUND UP OF BIG BOOKS) 
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1999 Special for The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was
the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch
of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of
Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it
was the winter of despair . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``THE SIXTIES'' &QL; 
Richard Avedon &QL; 
(Random House/Kodak, $75) &UR;
</P>
<P>
   It's my pleasure to tell you that Richard Avedon's new book,
``The Sixties,'' begins not with a photographic image but with the
opening paragraph of ``A Tale of Two Cities, words written 140
years ago but so remarkably suited to the edgy chaos of the 1960s
that you'll wonder whether Charles Dickens shared some funny
cigarettes with Abbie Hoffman in another life.
</P>
<P>
   Avedon and his collaborator, Doon Arbus, have put together a
book that shows the decade in all its abrasive and contradictory
glory. Notice the juxtaposition of Rose Kennedy and Janis Joplin
(at opposite ends of the book, each wearing her version of finery
and an eerie frown), Truman Capote displaying his belly button and
Andy Warhol his scars, the stiff stare of Henry Kissinger and the
serene gaze of Cesar Chavez. There's the requisite nudity _ female
breasts are outnumbered, for once, by male genitalia _ and every so
often a splash of color that reminds us that psychedelic was a
household word. It will make you squirm, and it will make you laugh
_ a '60s effect indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other big books you might spend your money on this
Christmas season:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
``ILLUSTRATED LETTERS: ARTISTS AND WRITERS CORRESPOND'' &QL; 
Edited by Roselyne de Ayala and Jean-Pierre Gueno (Abrams, $60). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here is the art of the handwritten letter taken to grand
heights. The editors have gathered more than 60 letters written by
European artists and authors of the 19th and 20th centuries. Some
are just notes with doodles in the margins. Others are illustrated
with exquisite sketches and watercolor scenes. Among the generous
correspondents: Honore de Balzac, Victor Hugo, Guy de Maupassant,
Arthur Rimbaud, Auguste Rodin, Edouard Manet, Vincent van Gogh,
Paul Gaugin, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Pablo Picasso, Max Jacob
and Antoine de Saint-Exupery. With a foreword by Francine Prose. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``FAY'' &QL; 
William Wegman (Hyperion, $26.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you've grown tired of Wegman's ubiquitous Weimaraners, this
book might pull you back into the fold. The text that accompanies
Wegman's photos of his beloved Fay Ray and her offspring, Battina
(who stayed on after Fay's other puppies went off to new homes),
reminds us that these were DOGS, that in addition to their work
with Wegman _ Fay, especially, knew how to hold a pose _ they
chased balls, hurled themselves into swimming pools, played in the
mud, mated, gave birth and changed their owner's life in ways not
just professional. If there's a dog lover on your Christmas list,
look here. &QL; 
 &QL; 
WOMEN &QL; 
Annie Leibovitz, with an essay by Susan Sontag (Random House,
$75). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Portraits of women, celebrated and obscure. It begins with a
photograph of Leibovitz's mother, then moves on to farmers, maids,
astronauts, soldiers, battered wives, Supreme Court judges,
showgirls and bull riders. More familiar faces are those of
Elizabeth Taylor, architect Maya Lin, writers Eudora Welty and
Jamaica Kincaid, Yoko Ono, Susan Sarandon, Joni Mitchell, Serena
and Venus Williams, Hillary Clinton and Madeleine Albright. It's
worth the price of admission just to see the kind gaze of the late
Osceola McCarty, who worked for 75 years as a Mississippi
washerwoman, then donated $150,000 that she'd saved over her
lifetime to establish a college scholarship for African-American
students in need. &QL; 
 &QL; 
THE ART OF THE MARKET &QL; 
Bob Tamarkin and Les Krantz (ST&AMP;C, $35). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An illustrated history of American business as seen through its
stock certificates. The paper certificates that were proof of
ownership before the days of electronic trading are becoming
financial artifacts with a value of their own. From a terrier named
Prince, who appeared on certificates issued by Farmers Deposit
National Bank in Pittsburgh in the early 1900s (Prince's owner was
the bank president), to the nude woman on certificates for Playboy
Enterprises, Tamarkin and Krantz show how whimsical a marriage of
art and commerce can be. &QL; 
``AND THE CROWD GOES WILD'' &QL; 
Joe Garner (Sourcebooks, $49.95). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The big draw is not the book, which is nothing extraordinary,
but two CDs that offer broadcasts of some of the most memorable
moments in sports. Included are Lou Gehrig saying goodbye to
baseball; Bill Mazeroski's home run in the 1960 World Series; the
Green Bay Packers' win over Dallas in December 1967; Bob Beamon's
long jump in the 1968 Olympics; Secretariat's triumph in the Triple
Crown; the Borg-McEnroe match at Wimbledon in 1980; Tiger Woods'
triumph at the 1997 Masters; Michael Jordan's sixth NBA
championship; and the U.S. women's win in soccer's 1999 World Cup.
With a foreword by Hank Aaron, an afterword by Wayne Gretzky, and
narration by Bob Costas. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``SNAKE'' &QL; 
Chris Mattison (DK, $29.95). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Big, bold pictures of creatures you don't want to find under
your Christmas tree. There are more than 60 individual species from
all over the world in Mattison's ``gallery,'' with information
about environment, anatomy, reproduction, and hunting and feeding.
A starter for would-be herpetologists. &QL; 
``NORMAN ROCKWELL: PICTURES FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE''  &QL; 
(Abrams, $35). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you love the paintings of Norman Rockwell, you can come out
of the closet now. Critics and art historians who previously looked
down their noses at Rockwell are now celebrating his influence on
the American psyche. This book, published in conjunction with the
traveling exhibition of the same name, includes 80 of Rockwell's
paintings, as well as essays not only by curators and historians
but by Robert Coles and Rockwell's son, Peter. The paintings are
anecdotal and as familiar as your own memories. The essays at times
seem like a collective  &UR; mea culpa offered to a man long regarded as
a mere illustrator, and to the people who have admired him for
decades. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``AFRICAN CEREMONIES'' &QL; 
Carol Beckwith and Angela Fisher &UR; Abrams, $150) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This slip-cased, two-volume set weighs 16 pounds, covers 26
countries and contains descriptions and photographs of more than 40
ceremonies, some of which will make you flinch just to think about
them. Spectacularly illustrated, it's the cornerstone of the
authors' effort to document vanishing tribal customs in Africa. &QL; 
``NEW YORK: AN ILLUSTRATED HISTORY'' &QL; 
Ric Burns and James Sanders &UR; (Knopf, $60). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a good deal of strolling on the thin edge of
nothingness. A splattering of fiery particles cascades down from
the torches that the steel workers use for cutting 10-ton girders
in half and for lighting their cigarettes.'' That's how the ``New
York Times'' described the spectacular bravado of the men who built
the Empire State Building in 1930, one of the best stories in this
elegant companion volume to the public television documentary
written and directed by Burns. &QL; 
``EARLY DYLAN'' &QL; 
Photographs by Barry Feinstein, Daniel Kramer and Jim Marshall
(Bulfinch, $35). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It could break your heart, he looks so young and happy. So do
Joan Baez and Mary Travers and even Johnny Cash. They stay that way
within the confines of this slim book, unlike the aging Dylan we
see in Richard Avedon's ``The Sixties.'' This collection of
photographs is a slice of '60s life that skirts the flamboyance and
focuses on a handful of people, their friendships and their music.
With a short foreword by Arlo Guthrie. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``YACHTING'S GOLDEN AGE'' &QL; 
Ed Holm (Knopf, $65) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here are more than 100 glass-plate images documenting yachting's
glory days, from 1880 to 1905. You don't have to know much about
sailing to see that these boats were extraordinary, each a
one-of-a-kind, handcrafted vessel with a unique personality. When
seen from across an expanse of water, they looked, Holm writes,
like ``a flight of giant migrating butterflies,'' their sails
swollen all out of proportion to the tiny crafts below. These
images were made by a handful of pioneering maritime photographers,
who used techniques developed in the years after the Civil War.

BRIGHT LIGHTS, SIN CITY: `PORTRAITS' OF VEGAS' MOVERS AND SHAPERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 
 (RESENDING TO FIX TYPO IN HUNTINGTON PRESS WEBSITE AT END)  
 ``THE FIRST 100:  PORTRAITS OF THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO SHAPED LAS
VEGAS'' 
  
 By A.D. Hopkins and K.J. Evans from the archives of 
 the ``Las Vegas Review-Journal''  (Huntington Press, $34.95) 
 &HT;     By DAVE WALKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not just slot-machine feeders finding the new Las Vegas to
be an irresistible attraction.
</P>
<P>
   Publishers, too, are squinting into the Strip's bright lights
and seeing dollar signs.
</P>
<P>
   Oxford University Press recently published a collection of
essays titled ``The Real Las Vegas: Life Beyond the Strip.''
Villard Books offers Andres Martinez's ``24/7: Living It Up and
Doubling Down in the New Las Vegas.'' Early next year, Bantam
Doubleday Dell will sell Pete Earley's ``Super Casino.''
</P>
<P>
   No wonder. Combine Sin City's colorful past with its current
boom, and you've got a sizzling 20th century story.
</P>
<P>
   Readers interested in the finer details of that story could
start with ``The First 100,'' a new book from Las Vegas publisher
Huntington Press.
</P>
<P>
   A collection of profiles, the book _ actually a reprint of a
massive project by the ``Las Vegas Review-Journal'' _ tells the
city's history through its people. It was an end-of-the-century
undertaking designed to document a place perpetually engaged in
furious re-invention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these people I almost cried for not getting to meet,''
said A.D. Hopkins, who with K.J. Evans oversaw the project for the
``Review-Journal.'' ``For a lot of these people, there was no
archival material. For a lot of people here, we were establishing
the archival material.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The First 100'' includes the people behind some familiar Las
Vegas names and landmarks, including John C. Fremont, Harley
Harmon, James Cashman, Pat McCarran and Benny Binion.
</P>
<P>
   Also here are the peculiarly Las Vegas histories of marquee
names such as Caesars Palace and Circus Circus builder Jay Sarno,
Donn Arden (credited with perfecting the over-the-top _ and
sometimes topless _ showroom spectacular), Benjamin (don't call him
``Bugsy'') Siegel, Frank Sinatra, Howard Hughes and Elvis Presley.
</P>
<P>
   The balance of entries examines lesser-knowns while telling the
unlikely tale of how a mixture of Mormons, mobsters and
multimillionaires built a premier vice-tourism destination from raw
desert.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins, a 30-year Las Vegas veteran, once edited the
``Review-Journal's''history-heavy (but now, alas, defunct) Sunday
magazine, ``Nevadan.'' Hopkins personally wrote many of the
entries, as did the late K.J. Evans, another former ``Nevadan''
editor. (The entire project is also archived online at
www.lvrj.com, the paper's Web site.)
</P>
<P>
   Currently a special-projects editor for the paper, Hopkins, 56,
said a list of 300 profile subjects was suggested by readers, as
well as a committee of historians and ``Review-Journal'' staffers.
</P>
<P>
   The first big list ranged from beloved grade-school teachers to
beauty queens, bankers to burlesque stars. The final cut didn't
limit the list to the merely historically important.
</P>
<P>
   A considerable dose of imagination went into the selection
process. How else to explain the inclusion of John Seibold, who
popularized Las Vegas-based sightseeing flights over the Grand
Canyon? Or fabled hypemeister Bob Stupak, who was inspired to build
the Stratosphere Tower when a heavy windstorm blew down the sign in
front of his tacky Vegas World casino?
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of (the nominees) were important, but not very
interesting,'' Hopkins said. ``They were supposed to have a
long-term effect, but if there was a story that we wanted to tell,
we wouldn't let it slide.''
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins admitted that many of the people who didn't make the
final list were as fascinating as those who did. Take Larry Snow,
who popularized the game baccarat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baccarat makes money for hotels,'' Hopkins said. ``Sometimes
it's the difference between profit and loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Or John Stuart, who pioneered the celebrity-impersonator show.
</P>
<P>
   ``There used to be a lot of those, and it was his idea,''
Hopkins said. ``If you come up with a winning idea, a trend in
entertainment that shows no sign of of quitting, that's worth
something. That's a contribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there had been 150, he'd have made it.'' &QL;

the futuristic whims of architects are notoriously rare. But Winka
Dubbeldam, a 35-year-old Dutch-born architect based in Manhattan,
seems to have a knack for attracting patrons susceptible to her
visual poetry: the passion of a former sculptor for combining

bread, ironed everything from sheets to jeans, vacuumed the carpet

``At the Hessers' house, you do cry over spilled milk.'' So it was
with both curiosity and skepticism that I picked up Cheryl
Mendelson's wildly comprehensive, 884-page manual, ``Home Comforts:

   LAPIDUS-ARCHITECTURE (Miami) _ In the early 1990s, after his
wife's death, the legendary architect Morris Lapidus found himself
staring at a calendar white with blank dates. The designer of
Miami's Fontainebleau and Eden Roc hotels, Lapidus, then in his
early 90s, had retired from active practice and was sitting alone
in his ocean-front duplex, bored. In 1994, after serving on a
review panel for work by Miami architecture students, he had lunch
with a fellow juror, Deborah Desilets, and more lunches. ``He was
so removed from professional life,'' she said. ``I realized that he
had so much to give that it would be a shame not to find some way
to make it happen.'' Eventually they formed an informal
partnership, taking him from deep retirement to shallow retirement.
Now, at 97, he is back in business, sketching. By Joseph
Giovannini.

 &HT;    With Mob mentality, feet will get moving
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   An album ago, the first single out of Atlanta act Goodie Mob's
``Still Standing'' proclaimed that ``people don't dance no mo.''
Now Cee-Lo, T-Mo, Big Gipp and Khujo follow that declaration with
their most musical and danceable CD to date.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it is called ``World Party.'' And Goodie Mob has enlisted
some of the best producers in the business to entice a broader
audience off the wall and onto the floor. Longtime music providers
Organized Noize offer the easy hand-clappers ``Get Rich to This''
and ``I.C.U.,'' one-time Puff Daddy companion Deric ``D-Dot''
Angelettie hooks a muscular piano to ``Chain Swang'' and Dallas
Austin employs the electronic bounce he used on TLC's album
``Fanmail'' _ and the pop trio _ on the certain breakout single
``What It Ain't (Ghetto Enuff).''
</P>
<P>
   ``But wait,'' longtime followers of the Mob may be wondering,
``what happened to all the consciousness?'' It's still there. And
when the foursome is talking about ``Rebuilding'' instead of
picking up a 9mm gun (``Just Do It''), it's still praiseworthy.

 &HT;    A radiantly lyrical jazz percussionist does N.Y. proud
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the more promising jazz percussionists to emerge during
the past decade, 28-year-old Susie Ibarra enjoyed her highest
profile as the former drummer in tenor saxophonist David S. Ware's
quartet: a barnstorming outfit to which Ibarra brought a rainbow of
polyrhythmic hues and subtle devices (as Atlanta audiences
witnessed during 1998 and 1999 performances at Eyedrum and the
First Existential Congregation). Lately, she's embarked on her own
course as a bandleader. This debut disc from her trio is one of the
more openly lyrical and original albums to come out of the downtown
New York avant jazz scene this year. It features two musicians,
violinist Charles Burnham and pianist/homemade instrumentalist
Cooper-Moore, with whom the drummer enjoys an uncommonly
sympathetic rapport. That's a crucial issue, too, with music as
open and as pleasurably improvised as this.
</P>
<P>
   Over six original pieces, two alternate takes and a version of
Jimi Hendrix's ``Up From the Skies'' (a showcase for the
extraordinarily vocal nature of Burnham's violin), the trio gently
rocks out, maps the shadows of melancholy (Cooper-Moore's piano
introduction to ``Half Moon'' ushering in Burnham's fluid chamber
blues), travels through Southeast Asia and hauls out Cooper-Moore's
secret weapon, the diddley-bow, for a coda appropriately titled
``Laughter.''

 &HT;    CD mini review
 &HT;    By Shane Harrison,
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QR;  DANCE POP
</P>
<P>
   ``Afterglow''
</P>
<P>
   Dot Allison. Arista. 11 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Dot Allison first attracted attention as the winsome vocalist
for One Dove, an early '90s dance-pop group that disbanded after
one album, never making good on a promising start. With her first
solo effort, she takes the reins with surprising maturity and an
unwavering sense of purpose. This sounds like the work of a much
more experienced artist.
</P>
<P>
   Trip-hop, ambient drones and '60s psychedelia are all part of
her arsenal, but the most sublime moment is also the quietest.
``Tomorrow Never Comes'' has an achingly beautiful melody. When
Allison breathily intones the first line of the chorus (``With a
little courage, in time, you might forgive me''), the desolation is
palpable.
</P>
<P>
   There's a smoky, late-night vibe to ``Afterglow,'' but these
songs are much too thoughtful and complex for the jaded fashion
victims that brings to mind.

 &HT;    `Lola' is above the average run of thrillers
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Run Lola Run'' (R)
</P>
<P>
   A pyrotechnic celebration of style over substance, this kinetic
German film is the cinematic love child of every video game and MTV
quick-cut editing trick of the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   It's a nonstop adrenalin kick, even though the script sometimes
can't keep pace with its leggy heroine. That's the flame-haired
Lola (Franka Potente), who runs through the streets of Berlin to
save the life of her boyfriend, Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu), a bagman
for the mob who has misplaced 100,000 marks. She has 20 minutes to
get the cash or lose Manni for good _ either to his trigger-happy
bosses or to his dangerous plan of robbing a grocery store for the
loot.
</P>
<P>
   Spinning busy elaborations on this simple tale, writer-director
Tom Tykwer finds endless ways to stimulate the minuscule attention
spans of today's twentysomethings. He has so many visual surprises
and narrative digressions in his arsenal that you can never guess
where Lola, and the movie, are racing next. Especially since he
shoots the same 20-minute dash three separate times, with obstacles
in Lola's path _ a vicious dog, a baby carriage, nuns _ causing
completely different outcomes (romantic, tragic, mystical).
</P>
<P>
   The swift, fat-free movie employs animation, different film
stock, split-screen images and sharp doses of irony. But its speed
and brevity don't quite obscure the script's thinness. You may find
yourself asking questions you shouldn't. For example, why doesn't
Lola just grab the phone and call her dad? The answer is that, if
she did, there wouldn't be a movie. And because ``Lola'' is so much
fun, you're willing to shrug and accept the artifice.

<P>
   &QR;  ``Summer of Sam'' (R) _ This ``Summer'' is definitely long,
but it's not so hot. The killing spree of psycho David Berkowitz in
New York's summer of '77 is just one of many stories director Spike
Lee tries to tell. Also in the mix are the blackout, Reggie
Jackson's World Series and rising tensions among some
Italian-American homeboys in the Bronx for whom it would already be
a long, hot summer without the added stress of a killer among them.
It's as if Lee had tried to make a Robert Altman movie. Not a good
idea. Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   _Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland'' (G) _ A kind of
extended episode of ``Sesame Street,'' this movie is recommended to
the very, very, very young. And, perhaps, to any parents curious to
see how the old gang looks after all these years (hint: Big Bird
has aged better than Bob). Essentially, little Elmo (voice by Kevin
Clash) must go to Grouchland to rescue his blanket from a meanie
named Huxley (a hammy Mandy Patinkin). Vanessa Williams appears as
the Queen of Trash. Fill in your own joke. Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   _Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``American Pie'' (R) _ It's a raunchy, throwaway, pre-adult,
R-rated high school sexcapade with dirty dialogue and more than one
risque encounter between students that's broadcast over the
Internet. There's also the grossest joke involving a beer you're
likely ever to see on film. Little in ``American Pie'' deserves
honest laughs. It rarely comes close to matching the free-spirited
hilarity of the embarrassingly funny ``There's Something About
Mary.'' (Available in R-rated and unrated versions.) Grade: C+

 &HT;    (Mike McManus is a syndicated columnist whose ``Ethics &AMP;
Religion'' appears in almost 100 newspapers)
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 By MIKE McMANUS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    ''Jesus Christ, the greatest man who ever lived, has changed
virtually every aspect of human life _ and most people don't know
it,'' asserted Rev. D. James Kennedy and Jerry Newcombe in their
inspiring 1994 book, ''What If Jesus Had Never Been Born?''
 &HT;    They give persuasive evidence that people inspired by Jesus
created mass education, modern science, representative democracy,
capitalism, the elevation of women, the ending of slavery and the
creation of universities and hospitals.
 &HT;    I wrote a column on the book five years ago. This week I re-read
it, and decided to write a fresh column for Christmas. In my second
reading, I saw tragic elements mixed with the joy of recognizing
the extraordinary impact of Jesus.
 &HT;    Before Jesus came into the world, life was cheap. It was
dangerous for a baby to be conceived in classic Rome or Greece,
where abortion and child abandonment was widespread. An unwanted
baby would be left in the woods to die or be eaten by wild animals.
However, abortion and abandonment disappeared in the early church.
Why? Christians considered every life to be precious, created ''in
the image of God'' (Genesis 1:27).
 &HT;    Sadly, life is becoming cheap again. Abortion is widespread and
assisted suicide has been legalized in Oregon. In Sudan, people
captured in war are sold as slaves for $50.
 &HT;    ''Every school you see, public or private, is a visible reminder
of Jesus Christ. The phenomenon of education for the masses has its
roots in Christianity,'' Kennedy and Newcombe write. The world's
languages were first set to print by Christians who wanted people
to be able to read the Bible. Luther translated the Bible into
German.
 &HT;    In Geneva, Calvin advocated education for everyone so that they
might know God and glorify Him. The Puritans passed a law in 1642
requiring education for all children. And for 217 years, all
schools in America were private and financed by Christians. The
result, according to John Quincy Adams, was that only 4 out of
1,000 adult Americans were illiterate in the early 1800s.
 &HT;    Public education was introduced in 1837. Its resulttoday: 40
million illiterates -- a literacy rate approaching that of Zambia.
 &HT;    ''Had Jesus never been born, there never would have been an
America,'' writes Kennedy. First, Columbus discovered America on
his way to plant Christianity in the Orient. Before they left the
Mayflower, the Pilgrims agreed to the first Christian
self-government in the ''Mayflower Compact.'' They pledged for
''the Glory of God,'' to ''combine ourselves together in a civil
Body Politick.'' That inspired 100 different compacts and
constitutions in New England.
 &HT;    Samuel Adams, who did more than any to arouse opposition to
English rule of America, said, upon the signing of the Declaration
of Independence, ''We have this day restored the Sovereign to whom
all men ought to be obedient. He reigns in heaven...let His kingdom
come.''
 &HT;    Underlying democracy's development was Scripture: ''Where the
Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty'' (II Cor. 3:17).
 &HT;    However, many Americans have transformed liberty into license.
It is outrageous that pornography is defended as ''freedom of
speech,'' and that half of U.S. marriages end in divorce when vows
were taken on God's altar ''till death do us part.''
 &HT;    ''If Jesus had never been born, science would likely not have
come into being,'' the authors assert. ''You would not be reading
this book by electric light. You would not have a microwave oven, a
television, or a radio.''
 &HT;    Modern science could not have developed among Arabs because of
the fatalism that underlies the Muslim religion. If everything is
fatalistically determined, why try to change the natural world? Nor
could science have originated in Hindu India or in China among
Buddhists, for both faiths ''teach that the physical world is
unreal and that the only reality is that of the world's soul.'' By
contrast, Christians taught that God is rational, the source of
truth.
 &HT;    Blaise Pascal, whose math innovations and probability science
was important enough for a computer language to be named after him,
wrote that God is not merely ''Author of mathematical truths and
the order of the elements...but the God of Abraham,'' Isaac, Jacob.
''The God of Christians is a God of love and consolation.''
 &HT;    Bible-believing scientists founded branches of science:
antiseptic surgery, Joseph Lister; bacteriology, Louis Pasteur;
calculus, Isaac Newton; computer science, Charles Babbage;
comparative anatomy, Georges Cuvier; chemistry, Robert Boyle;
genetics, Gregor Mendel.
 &HT;    Yet in India, millions of Hindus who believe in Jesus refuse to
become active Christians, according to Ralph Winter, founder of the
U.S. Center for World Missions. ''They see Christianity as the
carrier vehicle for alcohol, sexual liberation and tearing down the
family.''
 &HT;    It is up to this generation to reform Christianity to make it
credible to unbelievers.

NEW PLACE DOESN'T AGREE WITH OLD FRIEND
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY  
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: My little computer was running fine before I
packed it up and moved to a new city. It stayed in my closet for
about three months before I found the time to set it up again. When
I plugged everything in, it screamed, ``Operating system not
found.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Un-Smooth Operator
</P>
<P>
   DEAR UN: Well, how would you feel if somebody ignored you for
three months at a time? Sure, my ex-girlfriend never seemed to
mind. At least I think she didn't, but I haven't seen her for a
while, and she's not returning my calls.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe all that time in the closet was the last straw for the
computer. Stored in an unusual position, the drive platters might
warp, especially if they were exposed to temperature extremes.
Maybe excess dust got into the drive or the spindle lubricant
turned into sludge.
</P>
<P>
   Pop the cover, blow the dust away, and try listening to your
computer for a change. Does it sound like it used to? Does the
drive activity light come on? You really have nothing left to lose,
so turn off the PC and give the drive a sharp smack on the side.
Sometimes that frees anything that's gummed up. It feels good, too.
But don't let my therapist hear that.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe your problem runs deeper than simply ignoring your PC. I
don't think it handled the move very well, but you can't really
blame it: Moving was your idea.
</P>
<P>
   I hope you realize how fragile your computer is and that
bouncing around in the back of a moving truck is no life for a
delicate piece of machinery. It's entirely possible that the hard
drive suffered physical damage.
</P>
<P>
   Most drives retract their recording heads when you power them
down, but a good jolt might send one of them clanging into the disk
surface.
</P>
<P>
   So, what's next? I'd probably end the relationship at this
point: Reformat the drive and install Windows again. If there is
drive damage, though, it's not going to get any better. Some things
just can't be fixed. But, don't worry. There are plenty of other
drives in the computer store. I'm sure you'll find the one meant
just for you.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I take issue with the blanket statement that
simply reading an e-mail is safe. It has recently been shown that
reading or previewing an e-mail may cause a problem. There is a
patch on the Microsoft site, but it is just a matter of time before
virus writers are able to work around the patch. While the greatest
risk comes from opening attachments, sadly, it is no longer true
that reading e-mail is 100 percent safe.
</P>
<P>
   _ Inoculated
</P>
<P>
   DEAR INOC: Nothing is safe as long as there is one doofus out
there who thinks he knows how to mess with your life. How long
before it's not even safe to get out of bed, much less do anything
productive on your computer?
</P>
<P>
   The viruses you're talking about are ``Trojan horses'' that
exploit the preview panes in some e-mail programs. The same kind of
hidden code that makes Web pages dance and sing can launch
destructive programs once they're activated by just previewing a
message.
</P>
<P>
   All we can do is keep informed about the latest viruses and
remedies at places like Symantec (www.symantec.com/avcenter/) or
McAfee (www.mcafee.com). That means checking every day, not
periodically. Remember, those dysfunctional dweebs have nothing
better to do. It's not like they have dates to the prom or
anything.

DON'T THROW AWAY KEYBOARD JUST YET
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN  
c.1999 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the Holy Grails of personal computing has long been voice
recognition. Its proponents believe that it's better to talk to
your computer than use that ancient instrument of torture known as
the keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   For the last few years, the companies that make software that
can control a PC and turn words into text have said that it is
finally ready for prime time, that it's good enough for everyday
people to use comfortably. Come and get it!
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it wasn't true then. And, it's almost not true
now.
</P>
<P>
   I've been looking at each of the new voice-recognition releases
over the last two years, but haven't found anything worth writing
about. These earlier versions took too long to train to recognize
an individual's voice and speech, and once they did, their
recognition success rates were unacceptably low.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, with each new version, these programs have gotten
better. And, the latest are the best so far, but it's largely
thanks to a pair of advances in hardware.
</P>
<P>
   The first is a set of new multimedia-enhancing code found in
Intel Corp.'s Pentium III chips, as well as in Advanced Micro
Devices' Athlon processors. This code can be used to boost the
ability of the software to hear and translate words into text more
accurately.
</P>
<P>
   The second is the development of microphones that plug into a
Universal Serial Bus, or USB, port. These bypass a computer's
traditional sound card, which takes two large variables out of the
voice-recognition equation _ card and microphone quality. Using a
USB microphone greatly increases the accuracy of what the computer
hears.
</P>
<P>
   I've been looking at two voice recognition programs, both of
which work with a USB microphone _ Dragon Systems Naturally- &QL; 
Speaking Preferred 4.0 and Lernout &AMP; Hauspie's VoiceXpress
Professional 4.0. They were tested on a computer that has a
500-megahertz Pentium III chip. While both are much better than
what was offered just two years ago, I still found them frustrating
to use. However, they're now good enough that those with
disabilities or who are seriously keyboard-phobic can use them for
everyday tasks.
</P>
<P>
   And, in case you're wondering, no, I didn't write this review
using the software. It would have driven me nuts.
</P>
<P>
   _ NaturallySpeaking Preferred USB 4.0, $249, Dragon Systems. Of
the two systems I tried, NaturallySpeaking had the best voice
recognition accuracy, but was not as good at maneuvering around
Windows 98 as I would have liked.
</P>
<P>
   However, if you are a WordPerfect user, you'll definitely want
to select this title, because it meshes so well with that word
processor. In fact, one version of the WordPerfect Office 2000
suite comes with an integrated version of NaturallySpeaking.
</P>
<P>
   As with all voice recognition products, you must spend time
training the program to recognize your voice. NaturallySpeaking has
you select a passage to read from several sources _ I chose a
chapter from Arthur C. Clarke's novel ``2001: A Space Odyssey,''
which seemed fitting _ and the computer listens while you read.
</P>
<P>
   You can go through as many training sessions as you like, each
taking about 15 minutes, but Dragon claims decent accuracy with
just one session for those who have a clear, unaccented voice.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, I was able to do fairly well, achieving about 95 percent
accuracy when I read from a document. When I just dictated off the
top of my head, though, accuracy dropped way off. I found I was
distracted by watching the process of the computer converting words
to text, and it threw off my natural rhythm of speech. Since I
trained the computer by reading to it, it was confused by the
different speech pattern.
</P>
<P>
   NaturallySpeaking also was best at using voice to correct
mistakes. Both programs bring up a text box that lets you alter
mistranslated words, and with this program I seldom had to resort
to typing in the correct letters.
</P>
<P>
   However, I found it clunky using this software to control
Windows applications. For example, inserting Web addresses into
Internet Explorer was very frustrating, as was choosing which
e-mail to open and read in Eudora Pro.
</P>
<P>
   This version comes with a headset USB microphone, which is why
it costs as much as it does. If you buy the USB microphone
separately, you can get the software for about $200.
</P>
<P>
   _ VoiceXpress Professional 4, $150, Lernout &AMP; Hauspie: Although
it doesn't say so on the box, VoiceXpress professional will work
with a USB microphone _ and a coupon for a Telex model is inside.
It comes with a basic headset microphone, but it's worth spending
the $60 for a USB version.
</P>
<P>
   VoiceXpress' package claims it can go through its training
process _ which L&AMP;H calls ``enrollment'' _ in about 12 minutes.
However, that's for reading a single passage, and I noticed at the
end of the session that it recommended I go through more enrollment
for better results, which in effect doubled the training time.
</P>
<P>
   VoiceXpress was not quite as accurate as NaturallySpeaking. I
topped out at about 90 percent accuracy when reading text, and
accuracy in simple dictation dropped off. I also found it was
harder to correct using my voice _ I frequently had to resort to
typing corrections. Even trying to spell the word verbally resulted
in errors.
</P>
<P>
   However, VoiceXpress was better at navigating Windows. It also
comes with the ability to create voice-based macros _ a series of
commands you can execute with a single word. For example, if you
have a favorite Web site, you can have VoiceXpress launch your
browser and go directly there just by saying its name.
</P>
<P>
   VoiceXpress comes with a series of small applications called
TalkingTools designed specifically to work using voice commands,
including a notepad, calculator, an address book and a time-zone
clock. There's even something called the Web Finder, which lets you
ask a question that's then sent to a Web search engine.

OOPS! INTEL CELERON CACHE WAS OVERSTATED
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN  
c.1999 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: In your Dec. 3 story on specifications for shopping for a new
computer you mentioned that buyers should look for a microprocessor
that has at least 256 kilobytes of cache. But then you also
recommended Intel's Celeron processor for some buyers, and it only
has 128 kb of cache. Does this mean you advise against a Celeron
because it only has 128?
</P>
<P>
   A: Oops! Mea culpa. I blew it.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to juggle the various kinds of chips that are out
there _ and users really do have quite a choice _ I got some
specifications crossed.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Celerons have 128 kb of cache, and that's fine for the kind
of users in the first two categories _ novice and basic
home/business users. The Celeron is an excellent bargain _
essentially a Pentium II with less cache. Most users will not
notice the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There's a text file on my computer that I would like to
change, but I am not allowed to change it. When I try, I get told
that this is a ``read-only'' file. What can I do to change it?
</P>
<P>
   A: The way a file is stored on your hard drive is known as its
``attributes.'' A read-only file is one that you can't write to
and, in some cases, you may not be able to delete it.
</P>
<P>
   In bad old MS-DOS days, you had to issue an arcane string of
characters in your command line to change a file's attributes. But
with Windows 95/98, you can do it with the mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Find the file you want to change and right-click on it. Choose
``Properties'' from the menu that appears.
</P>
<P>
   At the bottom of the resulting box, you'll see a series of check
boxes, and one of them will be Read-Only. Uncheck it to be able to
change the file.
</P>
<P>
   You also can change the attributes of all the files in a folder.
Right-click on a folder and choose Properties. If all the files in
the folder are read-only, you'll see the plain,
black-check-on-white-background checkbox you saw in the single
file. But if only some are read-only, the background in the box
will be gray. Click on it until the box is cleared.
</P>
<P>
   What are some of the other checkboxes you see there? The
``Archive'' box allows programs such as backup software to grab
files that are frequently changed. ``Hidden'' is self-explanatory _
it will hide files when you open the folder, but only if your
Folder Options are set up to hide hidden files. ``System'' is to
indicate a file is an important part of the operating system _
don't mess with it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I updated the video drivers for the first time on a new
computer. I watched the process and could see the installer put the
drivers in the windowssystem folder. But when I look in my AOL
download folder, I see the drivers are in there! Are they in both
places? Do I need to leave them or can I delete them?
</P>
<P>
   A: When you download an update package like this, it's often
comprised of a cluster of files that first must be unpacked, then
installed. What you're seeing in the AOL download folder are the
unpacked files.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, a well-written install program will clean up after
itself and delete the files it unpacked. Not all do this. In fact,
some packages merely unpack the files, then leave it to you to
start the installation routine by finding and clicking on a Setup
program.
</P>
<P>
   Once you have the files installed, you should be able to delete
them. Be sure to inspect any instruction or ``read-me'' files
before you do.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have been told to use Windows Update to keep Windows 98
files up to date, but I keep getting a message wanting me to
approve downloading something from Microsoft before I continue.
What is this?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's a component that automates the process of seeing what's
already installed as part of Windows 98, downloading the patch and
installing it. Don't worry, it's a good thing. Without it, you have
to download these patches and install them manually.

FAILED SUPERCOMPUTER CHIPS RETURN IN CONSUMER GUISES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A microprocessor that failed commercially when
it was introduced for supercomputers in the 1980s is about to find
new life in home entertainment and other consumer devices of the
next decade, many of which will require more raw computing power
than the most powerful machines from a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard and STMicroelectronics, Europe's second-largest
maker of computer chips, plan to announce on Monday that they are
forming a research and development partnership to adapt the old
design to a new generation of home products.
</P>
<P>
   The technology, known as VLIW, for ``very long instruction
word,'' was pioneered by computer designers at Yale University in
the early 1980s. It was commercialized in the mid-80s by Multiflow,
a Connecticut company that made supercomputers.
</P>
<P>
   Like a scheme to increase traffic flow by packing cars
bumper-to-bumper in high-speed freeway lanes, VLIW uses a special
``compiler'' that packs the computer's instructions densely so that
processing takes place more efficiently. Compilers are the software
that translates a programmer's written code into the binary
language of computers.
</P>
<P>
   Recently some VLIW concepts found their way into the IA64
microprocessor being jointly developed by Hewlett and Intel. Intel
is planning to begin producing the first IA64 chip, named Itanium,
in the middle of next year.
</P>
<P>
   Both Intel and Hewlett-Packard were silent investors in
Multiflow. Joseph A. Fisher, a former Yale computer scientist who
co-founded Multiflow, joined Hewlett-Packard in 1990, establishing
a small research group in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Other computer makers, including Sun Microsystems and Texas
Instruments, have also recently turned to VLIW designs in
microprocessors and microcontrollers found in thousands of consumer
products, ranging from automobiles to washing machines.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, consumer video and audio entertainment products
require processing speeds once found only in supercomputers.
</P>
<P>
   In such applications, where the processing tasks are relatively
repetitive, compared with the work performed by general purpose
computers, VLIW frequently has huge cost and power advantages.
</P>
<P>
   For example, it fits well with the kinds of computing power
demanded by modern printers, which must scale or transform the
colors of an image that consists of millions of pixels.
</P>
<P>
   Still to be proven, however, is whether VLIW designs will become
the dominant technology for general-purpose applications.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still a lot of debate about whether the IA64 is
really the right technology,'' said Linley Gwennap, editorial
director of Microprocessor Report, an industry newsletter. But he
also acknowledged that in some applications, like printers, VLIW
``makes a lot of sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Hewlett-Packard, a leading maker of computer
printers, and STMicroelectronics say the VLIW approach has broad
applications in low-power devices like wireless phones.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will open up new portable applications that have not been
possible before,'' said Loic Lietar, corporate strategic marketing
manager at an STMicroelectronics manufacturing plant in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   STMicroelectronics, formerly SGS-Thomson Microelectronics, is
the second largest European semiconductor maker behind Philips, and
is the 9th-largest in the world. The company is a leading maker of
components for the cellular phone industry and analog
semiconductors. STMicroelectronics already makes components for
print heads for Hewlett-Packard's ink-jet printers.
</P>
<P>
   The research deal, which is expected to lead to products next
year, is a measure of vindication for Fisher, who has quietly
continued to work with VLIW technology in his small Cambridge
laboratory since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   He said in an interview Thursday that at times he had felt
depressed about the prospects of VLIW while waiting for hardware
technology to grow in sophistication.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, he said, ``There are many uses for embedded processors
that require powerful computing capabilities.''

PALM PILOT'S MARRIAGE TO CELLULAR PHONE A MATCH MADE IN HEAVEN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nearly two years ago, I started hearing rumors about the pdQ. A
friend who worked in Silicon Valley told me that Qualcomm had
licensed the Palm Pilot's operating system and planned to build it
into a cellular phone.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody was tremendously excited: combining a Pilot and a
wireless phone into a single device seemed like a no-brainer.
Pilots hold phone numbers, cell phones dial them. Could there be a
more natural technological marriage?
</P>
<P>
   But earlier this year, I started getting the feeling that the
project was in trouble. Qualcomm promised me that the phones would
be available in the summer of 1999, and then slipped shipments to
the fall. A friend at Wired magazine told me that he had seen the
phone and it was too big. Even my contact at Sprint played down the
phone, despite the fact that the company planned to sell them for
nearly $800. Nevertheless, Sprint agreed to let me borrow a phone
for a month.
</P>
<P>
   The results are surprising.
</P>
<P>
   The pdQ phone certainly does deliver on the promise of
integrating the Palm Pilot and a Qualcomm CDMA phone. On the
outside, the pdQ looks like a somewhat oversized cellular phone,
complete with a stubby antenna and a standard keypad on its
outside. But flip the keypad open, and the phone reveals the
familiar screen of a 3Com Palm Pilot. Next to the ``+/-'' buttons
that control the phone's volume is a little holster where you can
slide the stylus used to enter commands and letters with the same
shorthand, or ``graffiti'' alphabet used by the Palm Pilot. On the
top of the phone is a little plug for a headset and a big button
that controls the Palm's backlight.
</P>
<P>
   There are two ways to make a phone call with the pdQ: you can
either enter the phone number on the keypad and press the TALK
button, or you can look up a phone number on the Pilot and click a
new button on the Palm's screen: DIAL. You can also dial a few
digits from the phone number on the keypad, click the menu button
labeled name, and have the phone search through the Pilot's address
book for a match. The battery is rated at 2.5 hours talk time, 40
hours standby.
</P>
<P>
   When you're not placing phone calls, you've got the full power
of a Palm Pilot, which includes an address book, calendar, and
expense report. You can beam business cards to other Palm Pilots.
You also can download more than 1,000 Pilot applications from the
Internet and run them on this phone, something that no other
cellular telephone allows.
</P>
<P>
   The phone has a built-in wireless modem for Internet access. And
it comes with two wireless data applications: one for sending
e-mail, the other for viewing the Web. Unlike the Wireless Web
phones that I reviewed a few weeks ago, the pdQ has a real Web
browser that can display HTML text from practically any site on the
Internet. I was recently in a meeting and needed somebody's phone
number: I simply jumped onto the Internet, found the home page,
copied the phone number, pasted the phone number into my address
book, and then told the phone to dial. If I had wanted to, I could
have ordered a book from Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   The pdQ comes with a cradle that doubles as both the charging
stand and as the dock for synchronizing the phone with your
computer. Unfortunately, the stand is rather large _ so large that
it makes traveling with this phone something of a pain. It also
comes with a headset and three extra styluses, as well as the Palm
software that runs on a desktop computer.
</P>
<P>
   Early criticism of the phone's size is largely unwarranted.
Although the pdQ phone is larger than today's sleek-and-slim cell
phones, it's not noticeably larger than the cell phones that were
popular just a few years ago. It easily fits into my coat pocket,
for example. It weighs a little less than 10 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   But alas, the pdQ does have a number of problems, the biggest
being its screen. Although most cell phone screens are extremely
readable under a variety of lighting conditions, the pdQ's screen
is muddy and fairly low contrast, like most Palm Pilots. The
surface of the screen easily smudges and picks up oil and moisture
when you speak on it. The Pilot's screen simply wasn't designed for
use on a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   Another annoyance is the bassoon-like beep that the unit makes
whenever you touch the phone's keypad. It sounds like a cell phone
out of the 1980s! As near as I can tell, there is no way to mute
the tone or change the sound to touch-tones. Dialing the phone is
an annoying and somewhat embarrassing experience. The phone's
ringer is another letdown: there are only 13 boring rings from
which to chose, and they aren't very loud. Unlike my TouchPoint
phone, you can't assign different rings to different callers _ a
feature that is incredibly useful.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it's somewhat unnatural to control a cell phone with a
pen. Although you can use the phone's two menu buttons and volume
controls to scroll through your address list, this takes a long
time when you have a few hundred phone numbers programmed into the
thing.
</P>
<P>
   I hope that the pdQ phone sells well, because this phone is
certainly a step in the right direction. It's silly to carry both a
personal information manager and a cell phone, when both are
basically computers that store phone numbers and help you
communicate.
</P>
<P>
   It's also reprehensible that cell phone companies don't give
away developer's kits to let hobbyists and entrepreneurs write
programs for today's generation of cell phones. The pdQ skirts this
problem, by letting people download and run standard Palm programs.
</P>
<P>
   But this phone is definitely for gadget pioneers, not the rest
of us. Qualcomm and Palm need to figure out how to smooth the
integration between the two devices, both in terms of hardware and
software.

PRIVACY AT A PREMIUM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're reading this on The Boston Globe's Web site, you know
what I look like. More's the pity.
</P>
<P>
   It's bad enough that I resemble an African-American version of
Mr. Potato Head. But I'm even more distressed by the idea that one
of you might recognize me as I flip through a copy of the National
Enquirer in the supermarket checkout line.
</P>
<P>
   I like anonymity, but I've lost it. Come to think of it, so have
the people reading this on line, and just about every other
Internet user. Once you log on, you leave an electronic trail that
can be followed right back to your home or office.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet does a great job of providing an illusion of
anonymity. You can always use zany made-up names in your e-mails,
or when signing up at a Web site. But your Internet service
provider will know your real name. Even if you don't provide your
real name to a Web site, that site does know your IP address, the
set of digits that identifies the Internet service you're using.
And that service provider can use the IP number to track you down.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are cookies, the little chunks of data that let
companies follow you as you browse the Web. Cookies used to be
harmless, because they contained no data to identify the user. But
as I reported a few months ago, some companies now have ways of
linking cookie data to your name and address. Web marketers will
know where you live.
</P>
<P>
   The only possible cure is a system that lets you travel the Net
incognito, concealing your true identity at every point along the
way. The best-known technique for this is called an anonymous
remailer. This is an Internet e-mail server that collects incoming
mail, gives it a phony e-mail address and IP number, then sends it
to its final destination.
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of such remailers on the Net, run as labors
of love by devotees of on-line privacy. But I've come across some
companies that hope to turn the hunger for privacy into a
profitable business.
</P>
<P>
   There's Proxymate, a Murray Hill, N.J., firm that's being
financed by Lucent Technologies Inc. and uses technology developed
at Lucent's Bell Labs division. The company is running a free test
of its service at www.proxymate.com. Proxymate lets the user route
all Internet activity through a server that conceals the origin of
messages.
</P>
<P>
   Say you type in the Web address for Yahoo. Instead of going
straight to the Yahoo server, your request goes to Proxymate, which
in turn contacts Yahoo. This way, Yahoo never sees your browser or
your IP address.
</P>
<P>
   When a Web site asks for your e-mail address, Proxymate can
generate a fake address that will let the site send you mail but
won't give away your true identity. You can get a different e-mail
alias for each Web site. If an alias is used to send you spam, you
simply cancel that alias; the others will still work.
</P>
<P>
   The system relies on software stored on Proxymate's own server,
so you don't need new software at your end. But it does have a weak
point _ the company needs to know your real e-mail address, so your
anonymity isn't absolute. This isn't good enough for the hackers at
Montreal-based Zero-Knowledge Systems Inc. (www.zeroknowledge.com).
</P>
<P>
   Zero-Knowledge president Austin Hill believes that even the
designers of a security system shouldn't be able to defeat that
system. So his company has come up with software called Freedom
that resides on the user's computer and encrypts all information
about the user so that nobody can retrieve it.
</P>
<P>
   Lose your Freedom password, and you're locked out forever.
</P>
<P>
   The Freedom system routes your Internet traffic through a
network of servers scattered around the world. You can set it up to
bounce your data around so wildly that nobody will ever trace it
back to you. Freedom offers alias e-mail, as well, but with a twist
_ it's encrypted to make it even more secure.
</P>
<P>
   Freedom isn't free. You'll pay $10 a year for each alias, and
there's a minimum price of $50. You can buy one alias for five
years, or buy multiple aliases _ one for shopping, one for casual
surfing, another for posting bulletin-board messages, another for
your on-line gambling addiction. And of course, one for weekly
visits to www.nationalenquirer.com.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1995, Bill Gates of Microsoftwrote an impassioned memo to his
lieutenants stirring them to confront the challenge of ``The
Internet Tidal Wave.'' That wave hit corporate America as a whole
in 1999, when companies large and small recognized that the impact
of the Internet would not be confined merely to Silicon Valley or
to the proliferating dot-com start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every business now knows that it faces the opportunity and
threat of being transformed by the Internet, and this was the year
that happened,'' said Daniel Yergin, a business consultant and
author.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has also become a powerful symbol of society's
expectations about the future _ a future of fast-moving, disruptive
technology that is shifting the terrain not only in business, but
also in politics and culture.
</P>
<P>
   The truth, of course, is that it is probably too early to judge
whether an Internet revolution is truly under way. Historians say
the Internet should be viewed mainly as the latest advance in
communications, a successor to the telegraph and the telephone,
more a technological step than a leap forward.
</P>
<P>
   Still, whether labeled a revolution or an evolution, the
Internet's impact on the economy seems destined to become greater
and greater. When people speak of the ``Internet economy,'' they do
not really mean that Internet businesses themselves suddenly loom
so large in the nation's $9 trillion economy. They are talking of a
technology and a pattern of business behavior that feels like the
future.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is seen as a technology of borderless free markets.
It is a global network with open technology standards, not owned or
controlled by a single company or nation. And it is magic on Wall
Street these days, driving the shares of many Internet companies to
astronomical heights.
</P>
<P>
   Because it is such a low-cost communications technology, the
Internet holds the promise of drastically reducing transactions
costs. This opens the door to what Michael Porter of Harvard's
business school has called ``atomistic competition,'' as market
forces and entrepreneurial ways are driven further down toward the
individual level. Organizational bureaucracies of every kind _
corporate, government and union _ suddenly look vulnerable to the
Internet's decentralizing powers.
</P>
<P>
   Even the power of nation states, already eroding, seems at risk.
Yergin, the co-author with Joseph Stanislaw of ``The Commanding
Heights,'' a history of the rise of the global marketplace,
observed: ``Nothing so symbolizes globalization as the Internet, a
technology with the power to leap across the geographic borders of
nation-states and across time zones.''
</P>
<P>
   Prediction tends to be a humbling, hit-or-miss endeavor even for
the gifted or lucky. In the late 1960s, for example, Sir Arthur C.
Clarke, the science fiction writer, predicted that by 2000 a vast
electronic ``global library'' would be developed _ and the Internet
and the World Wide Web could arguably qualify as one. Then again,
Sir Arthur also predicted that the planets would be colonized by
next year.
</P>
<P>
   But technologists, economists and futurists say that some
questions are worth asking when thinking about how the Internet
economy might evolve over the next few years. What was the mixture
of technology and policy decisions that created today's Internet?
What key technology and policy issues are likely to affect the
Internet over the next few years? And, finally, since the future is
usually the past with a twist, what can be learned from earlier
technology-driven transitions?
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has been embraced by libertarian free-marketers as
the embodiment of their values, but, to be sure, it began with
government financing. Yet liberals who point to the Internet to
support a pro-government stance _ at least in any conventional
sense _ are ignoring certain facts. The early money for the
Internet _ as well as for pioneering research in computer graphics
and speech recognition software _ came from an elite, the
Pentagon's Advanced Research Projects Agency. Its money came from
the military's largess, and ARPA's leaders spent it pretty much as
they pleased with little accountability. From the mid-1960s to the
mid-1970s, the agency's leaders displayed an uncanny knack for
backing long-term winners in technology.
</P>
<P>
   For two decades, the Internet was developed gradually in the
distinctive milieu of the nation's research centers by scientists
who believed in the free sharing of information and in open
technology standards. The next major policy pronouncement about the
Internet did not come until 1997, when the Clinton administration
released its ``Framework for Global Electronic Commerce.'' Written
by Ira C. Magaziner, a senior White House adviser, the report
called for a market-driven Internet. ``Business models must evolve
rapidly to keep pace with the breakneck speed of change in the
technology,'' the report said. ``Government attempts to regulate
are likely to be outmoded by the time they are finally enacted.''
</P>
<P>
   So the pattern of policy to date: shrewd government seeding of
research followed by benign neglect. But as the Internet
increasingly becomes a main thoroughfare of commerce, a host of new
policy issues loom _ how to deal with taxation, privacy, security
and international trade in a global networked economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet has given us the greatest rate of return on a
public infrastructure investment ever,'' said Robert Litan,
director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution. ``And it
has flourished because we have not yet taxed or regulated it to
death _ though those are live issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Technologically, the Internet is almost an economy unto itself _
a network, yes, but also a complex and interacting set of
technologies. Today's Internet is a result of a torrid pace of
improvement in recent years in computer networks, processing power,
data storage, software, display technology and user interfaces like
the Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer firepower of computers, experts say, is certain to
race ahead to startling effect over the next few years. Data
storage technology, for example, is advancing at a particularly
rapid rate. By 2003, personal computers may well come with terabyte
hard drives, which are roughly 100 times the capacity on new PC's
today, featuring about 10 gigabytes on average. A terabyte drive
would be able to hold every conversation that even the chattiest
person has had in a lifetime. Think of a supercomputer on every
desktop, in terms of giving individuals the ability to mine
personal or business information.
</P>
<P>
   In every field of academic and scientific research, computing
will increasingly be used for simulation and analysis. The real
payoff from the Human Genome Project, for example, will come not
from identifying the complete DNA sequence, but from understanding
how these complex proteins work. Such knowledge, medical experts
say, will be the basis for everything from developing personally
tailored drugs to discovering new ways to treat disease. The main
tool for stalking that breakthrough knowledge is computational
biology _ microbiological simulations run on powerful computers.
</P>
<P>
   The real technical challenge to the Internet economy will not
come from any shortcoming in raw computing power, but from the
difficulty of building up the global network to meet demand. The
next-generation vision of the Internet is of a high-speed global
network to which billions of devices are connected, from TV set-top
boxes and hand-held computers to refrigerators and washing machines
that would be able to do everything from optimizing fuel use to
requesting a repair call automatically online.
</P>
<P>
   But that kind of global nervous system of commerce and
communication will require far more than adding computers and
laying more wire. The Internet, after all, was originally designed
as a computerized ``party line'' for a small community of
researchers _ who knew and trusted each other _ to send e-mail. And
network complexity can increase exponentially _ that is, a network
with 200 million users is far more than twice as complex as one
with 100 million because each user, each computer and each line of
code can interact with others in the network in unpredictable ways,
just as in a biological organism.
</P>
<P>
   A presidential advisory group of leading computer scientists
concluded earlier this year that new research, fresh approaches and
more government money were needed to cope with the problem.
``Scaling the Internet to handle the expected growth over time is a
major challenge,'' said Irving Wladawsky-Berger, general manager of
the Internet division at IBM and a member of the group. ``And the
current infrastructure can't scale up.''
</P>
<P>
   The group's report to the White House warned that there would be
``catastrophic failures'' in the computer networks that
increasingly support the nation's defense and economy, unless those
networks were retooled.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Wladawsky-Berger predicts that the technical challenge
can be overcome, provided the government and industry make the
needed research investments. ``It should not be a showstopper,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, given the track record of success in computing, the
visceral optimism of the technologists seems justified. ``Sure
there are some tough problems, but it'll work,'' said Rick Rashid,
head of research at Microsoft. ``We can do it. We always have. In
information technology, that is the way it's always worked.''
</P>
<P>
   That information technology is delivering a problem-solving
payoff has been an article of faith in the corporate world for
years, far more so than among economists. Business investment in
computer hardware and software is running at $380 billion a year,
up steadily from the annual rate of $110 billion five years ago.
And corporate America is expected to keep increasing such
spending.. By the end of 2001, Macroeconomic Advisers, a research
firm in St. Louis, projects that business investment in computer
hardware and software will be running at a yearly rate of $513
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Economists expect the nation's extraordinary growth to continue
next year, though at a somewhat slower pace. The consensus among
the 50 forecasters in the Blue Chip Economic Indicators survey is
that the economy will expand 3.9 percent this year, with inflation
at 1.4 percent. For 2000, the consensus is growth of 3.2 percent
and inflation of 1.7 percent. In February, the economy should set
the record for the longest expansion, surpassing the 106-month
record set in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Just what impact information technology has had on the economy's
uncommon run of growth, productivity gains and low inflation is a
subject of heated debate within the economics profession. It is
probably too early to tell, but Litan of Brookings, who is leading
a yearlong study on the issue, sponsored by the Internet Policy
Institute, said, ``My instinct is whatever we find the economic
impact to be, it will be a lot greater five years from now.''
</P>
<P>
   The sense of being at the start of a business and economic
transformation, of course, has fueled the Internet start-up fever.
It seems a speculative bubble, but such periods of investment mania
foster a rapid pace of business experimentation. Thomas Eisenmann,
an assistant professor at the Harvard Business School, notes that
from 1900 to 1925 there were more than 3,300 automobile start-ups
in America turning out cars of many types _ some sporting three
wheels, some six; one model featuring a shiplike tiller for
steering; others trying electricity or steam as power sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see the same kind of winnowing in e-commerce,''
Eisenmann said. ``Some will succeed, but most will fail. We'll
repeat the past again, only faster.''
</P>
<P>
   For established companies, the Internet challenge is to adapt to
an accelerated technological shift. That was precisely the quandary
Gates was sketching out in his 1995 memo: Microsoft was threatened
by the rise of Internet software; yet if it scrambled, he wrote,
the company could benefit from the Internet. The speed of
Microsoft's response is regarded as an exceptional case of a big
company's moving nimbly to change course, but the tactics it used
became the subject of the government's sweeping antitrust suit
against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet's openness, low-cost use and speed are its
distinctive features. The telegraph, historians note, had many of
the same qualities _ it was an electronic network that transformed
many business practices and was a new medium of informal
communication for many. Yet the telegraph was expensive in contrast
to the Internet. Sending a message was a household budgeting
decision; firing off an e-mail message today is not. ``The Internet
is the telegraph for the rest of us,'' noted Paul Saffo, a director
of the Institute for the Future.
</P>
<P>
   The speed at which the Internet is spreading across the globe,
pushing both the tools and values of high technology onto people,
could prompt a backlash. Peter Schwartz, a leading futurist and
business consultant, is a technology optimist. Along with Peter
Leyden and Joel Hyatt, he wrote, ``The Long Boom: A Vision for the
Coming Age of Prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Schwartz, while predicting that the pace of technological
change will not slow, adds that the willingness of people to accept
new technology could reverse sharply if companies and governments
do not make the right policy choices.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet economy carries the potential for creating ``a deep
divide between those who have the skills to prosper and those who
don't,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why education policy is so important,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The social tolerance for technology, Schwartz added, could also
cool. The advance of nuclear power in the United States, he said,
came to a standstill because the public fears after the Three Mile
Island accident were not allayed. The recent resistance to
genetically altered foods and the protests in Seattle over the
World Trade Organization's global influence on environmental and
labor protections, he said, are warning signs.
</P>
<P>
   ``An inadequate appreciation of either the losers in this new
economy or of the people with legitimate concerns could be real
problems,'' Schwartz said. ``If you don't address those groups
early on, it will come back to bite you.''

ELECTRONIC RETAILING TO A TRULY MASS MARKET IS EXPECTED
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ten years ago, Internet prognosticators sounded overzealous when
they suggested that an interconnected network of computers would
recast every facet of society.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most futuristic and Utopian predictions may never
play out, of course. But the Net does seem to be bringing
irrevocable change to one part of life: buying stuff.
</P>
<P>
   So far, online retailing has been the province of more affluent,
better-educated people who are the likeliest to have computers. But
demographic and technological trends seem likely to make electronic
retailing _ e-tailing _ a truly mass market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially recently, we've seen an abundance of high-end
luxury sites,'' said Ann Winblad, a founding partner of Hummer
Winblad Venture Partners, a venture capital firm. ``That'll change,
certainly in the next five years, as we'll see a lot more people
with lower incomes on the Web than today.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Winblad said that companies would continue to tinker with
the so-called free PC and free Internet access business models _
marketing techniques in which consumers are given simple PCs or
no-frills Internet access at low or even no cost, in exchange for
being captive to advertisers or to a specific set of retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the dismal track record of such approaches, she
predicted that marketers would persevere until they established a
technological link to the masses. ``It makes sense for these
companies,'' she said, ``because they can own the customer for a
lifetime of needs.''
</P>
<P>
   The impact on e-commerce will be profound, Ms. Winblad and
others said, because until now most marketing and business
assumptions have been based on an online population that has been
relatively affluent and ethnically homogenous. With a more diverse
socioeconomic mix, analysts said, users could expect a much wider
range of Internet services and products.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Paul Saffo, the director of the Institute for the
Future, a forecasting firm, expects the Internet to yield a range
of new products. ``Just as television produced new products, like
TV Guide, TV dinners and Ginsu knives,'' he said, ``we'll be buying
new stuff that never existed before because there's been no good
way to sell it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web's ability to concentrate geographically dispersed
markets, he said, is one clue to the type of products Internet
retailing will support. ``We'll have products for audiences that
have been so widely distributed in the past that there wouldn't be
a store for them,'' Saffo said, offering the example of snakeproof
boots as a product that would have an easier time finding a market
online.
</P>
<P>
   The same market-driven forces that will push the Internet to a
broader cross section of users will also deliver what Web users
have long ached for: faster connections. Venture capitalists,
Internet executives and analysts agree that so-called broadband
connections _ high-speed Internet access through cable modems or
telephone digital subscriber lines _ will bring new possibilities
to e-commerce in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
   Broadband's arrival will be sped by the ever-increasing flow of
venture capital money, as companies that have seen huge returns on
their recent investments look for ways to reinvest in start-up
companies that focus on network technology.
</P>
<P>
   Some start-ups will be racing with established companies like
the AT&AMP;T Corp. and Qwest Communications International to build
digital links capable of carrying more data, while others will be
competing with the likes of Akamai Technologiesto move that data
more efficiently across the network.
</P>
<P>
   With faster connections, ``I think we'll see a real change in
the way consumers approach the Internet,'' said Matt Hyde, vice
president of online sales at Recreational Equipment Inc., which
sells outdoor gear. ``Since the Internet will always be on at home,
it ends up being used like an appliance. People will use it for
tasks as they come up through the day and evening.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Hyde said, people will be much more inclined to buy
commodity items like paper towels or bed linens as the need arises,
``because it'll be so incredibly convenient.''
</P>
<P>
   From an Internet retailer's perspective, high-speed access
``will close the gap between the physical and virtual when it comes
to touch and feel,'' Hyde said, ``because with broadband, retailers
can do a lot more with helping people see products and understand
what they're about.''
</P>
<P>
   In theory, Web sites will be able to overcome bandwidth and
speed constraints, and display products from every conceivable
angle, analysts said. Sites might also include interactive features
like voice recognition or personalized shopping assistants without
worrying about data traffic slowing to a crawl. But pessimists warn
that with so many more people flocking to the Web and using such
bandwidth-sapping technologies, network speed may not increase soon
enough to prevent data traffic jams.
</P>
<P>
   For some forecasters, the biggest e-tailing change will not come
from cable modems or superfast phone lines _ in fact, it will not
involve a PC at all. Wireless technology, analysts say, will take
the Internet outside the home and office and into a raft of new
devices that may, or may not, be related to today's cellular
phones, Palm Pilots and the like.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Walker, founder of Priceline.com, predicted that mobile
e-commerce ``will give people the ability to shop in the personal
time they have between doing things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People will shop like they snack,'' Walker said. ``If you've
got 10 minutes, you'll look for a shirt, or you'll shop during a TV
commercial.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a behavioral change would require a revamping of e-commerce
sites, Walker said. Just as grocery stores were forced to create
express lanes for shoppers with time constraints, e-commerce sites
would need to create more features to let shoppers select and pay
for goods within 60 seconds. ``Retailers will have to adapt to the
time consumers say they have,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That assumes, of course, that consumers are doing business with
retailers in the first place. John Hagel, who leads the e-commerce
practice at McKinsey &AMP; Co., the management consultants, said that
consumers in the coming decade would increasingly do business with
what he called ``customer relationship businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   These businesses, he said, would be formed to serve as advocates
on behalf of buyers in their negotiations with sellers _ a sort of
union for consumers. These groups would not only provide buyers
with a wealth of information about what to purchase and at what
price, Hagel said, but they might also gather large numbers of
buyers together to effectively coerce sellers to cut their prices.
In the latter respect, these organizations would resemble two
current ``group buying'' sites _ Mercata and Accompany _ but with
much greater power in the marketplace, he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impact of e-commerce is to unbundle and re-structure
businesses,'' Hagel said. ``This is a prime example of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Nat Goldhaber, chief executive of Cybergold, a company that pays
consumers to respond to online advertisements, looks for
bricks-and-mortar shopping malls to ``go into very serious decline
and begin to disappear over the next 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   That hypothesis is drawn, he said, from the idea that consumers
will have ``a much more intimate relationship with manufacturers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dell Computer Corp. is the obvious example of this trend,
Goldhaber said, but he and many others in the industry expect more
manufacturers to follow suit. Meanwhile, traditional retail
shopping, he predicted, will lose its social function ``as people
use the Internet for the purpose of social interaction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sort of a radical in this regard,'' he said. ``But no
matter how dramatic you think the Internet will change the world,
you're underestimating it.''

TALKING THE FUTURE WITH: ROBERT W. TAYLOR

 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Internet has many fathers, but few deserve the label more
than Robert W. Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, as a director of the Pentagon's Advanced Research
Projects Agency Information Processing Techniques Office, Taylor
came up with the idea for the Internet's precursor, the ARPAnet.
After authorizing money for research to develop a nationwide
computer network, Taylor wrote a white paper in 1968, a year before
the network was created, with another ARPA research director,
J.C.R. Licklider. The paper, ``The Computer as a Communications
Device,'' was one of the first clear statements about the potential
of a computer network.
</P>
<P>
   Even before coming to ARPA, Taylor saw the computer's potential
as an interactive device. As a research manager at the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration, he arranged financing for
Douglas C. Engelbart, a young researcher who used the money at what
was then called the Stanford Research Institute, now SRI
International, to invent the computer mouse.
</P>
<P>
   At ARPA, Taylor's office continued financing Engelbart's Augment
research group, which pioneered many of the most important ideas in
today's computer industry. It was Taylor who financed Engelbart's
legendary demonstration of advanced computer technologies _
including the mouse, windows, hypertext, networking and
teleconferencing _ at the 1968 Joint Fall Computer Conference in
San Francisco. The demonstration left many of the nation's best
computer scientists, then living in a world of punch cards and
paper tape, in awe.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's contributions did not end there. After leaving ARPA and
spending a year at the University of Utah, he was hired to direct
the newly formed computer systems laboratory at Xerox's brand-new
Palo Alto Research Center. From that laboratory and several others
at PARC came the personal computer, computer networking, desktop
publishing, laser printers, the graphical user interface and modern
word processing.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, who never profited personally from the commercial
Internet boom, is now retired at 67 and lives in Woodside, Calif.
In a recent interview, he reviewed these pivotal events in the
computer industry and looked to what the future might hold.
</P>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from that conversation:
</P>
<P>
   Q: What led to your ideas about computer networking?
</P>
<P>
   A: I discovered computers in the 1950s, and the whole business
of punching holes in cards turned me off. I really wasn't
interested in computers from the beginning as an arithmetic engine.
What struck me about them really came home when I read J.C.R.
Licklider's 1960 ``Man-Computer Symbiosis'' paper. I said, ``Yeah!
Now we're talking!''
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did you come across that article?
</P>
<P>
   A: It appeared in an IEEE Transactions journal that I subscribed
to. I was working as a systems engineer at the Martin Company at
the time. That's when the power of interactive computing dawned on
me. I had other reasons to pay attention to Licklider. I did my
thesis on psycho-acoustics and Licklider was world famous in that
field, before he started to play around with computers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did you meet Licklider?
</P>
<P>
   A: NASA had approached me to become a program manager in 1961 to
look after research areas including flight displays and manned
flight-control systems. I told them they needed an area called
simulation technology because we were going to have to make huge
investments in simulation, and they liked that idea. In late 1962,
Licklider moved to ARPA and started this computer research program.
I was at NASA and he was at the Pentagon. I had been supporting
Doug Engelbart's work.
</P>
<P>
   Q: This led to the mouse?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. You know, it's quite funny _ several years ago NASA
began looking for spinoffs that their research had led to in the
civilian economy and they never realized that the mouse was
developed under a NASA contract. But Licklider, shortly after he
took over at ARPA, organized an informal committee of people in the
government who were supporting computer research. He invited me to
come over and join the committee. I walked into his office and
right away he started talking to me about my thesis. It blew me
completely away. How would he know anything about my thesis? I was
a no-name nobody graduate student. He wowed me from Day 1.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What did you set out to do at ARPA?
</P>
<P>
   A: I began to think that if I was going to do this for a while,
I wanted to find some particular program to measure my performance
by. I wanted to put a nail on the wall or whatever the proper
metaphor is. I wanted to make a difference. We had in my office
three terminals to three different programs that ARPA was
supporting. One was to the Systems Development Corp. in Santa
Monica. There was another terminal to the Genie Project at UC
Berkeley. The third terminal was to the CTSS project that later
became the Multics project at MIT. We hadn't had these terminals
very long. But I had already seen a very interesting thing. As
these three time-sharing projects came alive and they collected
users around their respective campuses, the only users they had
were local users because there was no network to speak of. All
communications were local except to ARPA.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What did you discover?
</P>
<P>
   A: The thing that really struck me about this evolution was how
these three systems caused communities to get built. People who
didn't know one another previously would now find themselves using
the same system. Because the systems allowed you to share files,
you could find that so-and-so was interested in such-and-such and
he had some data about it. You could contact him by e-mail and, lo
and behold, you would have a whole new relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Were these first communities built around mailing lists?
</P>
<P>
   :
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, you had a directory, so you knew how to send them
e-mail, but you might only know two or three people, and you would
meet 20 or 30 through the computer. It wasn't a static medium. It
was a dynamic medium. And that gave it a lot of power.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was all about community?
</P>
<P>
   L
</P>
<P>
   A: There was one other trigger that turned me to the ARPAnet.
For each of these three terminals, I had three different sets of
user commands. So if I was talking online with someone at SDC and I
wanted to talk to someone I knew at Berkeley or MIT about this, I
had to get up from the SDC terminal, go over and log into the other
terminal and get in touch with them. I said, oh, man, it's obvious
what to do: If you have these three terminals, there ought to be
one terminal that goes anywhere you want to go where you have
interactive computing. That idea is the ARPAnet.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When did you get the idea?
</P>
<P>
   A: I decided to do that in late 1965. In February of 1966, I was
officially the head of the Information Processing Techniques
Office. So I went to see Charlie Herzfeld, who was the head of
ARPA, and laid the idea on him. The first funding came that month.
He liked the idea immediately, and he took a million dollars out of
the ballistic missile defense budget and put it into my budget
right then and there.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was the idea an immediate success?
</P>
<P>
   A: I had to go around and talk to our contractors to see if I
could get their cooperation _ and some of them were enthusiastic,
and some of them saw it as an infringement on their computing
facilities. They said, ``I don't want to share my ((computing))
cycles with some guy across the country. I don't have enough cycles
as it is. Now you're going to build something that allows people to
come in and use my machine?'' That took a while to bring people
together.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you see right away that this would have an impact broader
than just a small group of military-funded researchers?
</P>
<P>
   A: Oh, yeah, sure. It was obvious to some of us that interactive
computing was here to stay. And by the late '60s, the personal
computer was obvious as well. By the time I went to Xerox in 1970,
I tried to get the guys to build the Alto ((one of the first
experimental personal computers)) and they built it two years
later, but that's a whole other story.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was there one shared vision?
</P>
<P>
   A: The model that some people were pushing in those days for how
this was going to spread was that there were going to be gigantic
computer utilities. This was the power utility model. I never
bought that. By the late '60s, Moore's Law was pretty obvious. It
was just a matter of time before you could afford to put a computer
on everyone's desk. That was what I came to Xerox to do.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did you arrive at Xerox?
</P>
<P>
   A: I left ARPA in late 1969 after I knew that the ARPAnet was up
and running, and I went to Utah for what turned out to be only a
year. When I was in Utah, I got a call from George Pake, a
physicist who was setting up Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center. I
had the impression that he just wanted to pick my brain. There was
no discussion of a job. He told me that Xerox was going to have a
research lab here in Palo Alto and part of it was going to be
devoted to computer research. The research group was going to
develop technologies that would be used at SDS, a computer company
that Xerox had recently purchased. I said, ``Oh, that's too bad.''
He said, ``What do you mean?'' ``Well, you won't be able to get
anyone who's any good to come work here because there's absolutely
no respect for SDS among the best computer folks.'' They were
floored. They said, ``What do you think we ought to do?'' I
replied, ``You ought to computerize the office; everything that
happens in the office can be put on the computer.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: If the personal computer has been the foundation for the
Internet, where will the next major burst of innovation come from?
</P>
<P>
   A: Broadband networks. If you take real-time video and audio and
you couple them, and you imagine some kind of a chair that's
connected to this system that you sit in and fly around wherever
you want to go ...
</P>
<P>
   Q: How will we use these new technologies?
</P>
<P>
   A: You'll also be able to wear _ maybe not in my lifetime but
certainly reasonably soon _ an unobtrusive device that will record
in full color and sound everything that you see or point your head
at, or, depending on how many of them you have, everything that's
around you. And share it. Every waking and sleeping moment in your
life will be recorded. And you will be able to store and retrieve
it and do what you will with it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How will that change the world?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't know, but it will. There are obviously implications
for privacy that will have to be worked through. I'm actually more
concerned about nearer-term issues. I want the Internet to become a
right, not a privilege. I think we need a driver's license to allow
you to use the Internet, much like you drive on the road today. If
you misbehave on the road, you get your license taken away.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have a sense of what the future will look like from a
computer network point of view?
</P>
<P>
   A: I can't help much about the future, I'm afraid. I was a bad
predictor of the future 30 years ago. I was sure that from the
early 1970s, all the pieces were there at Xerox and at ARPA to put
the Internet in the state by the early '80s that it is in today. It
was all there. It was physically there. But it didn't happen for
years.

SOFTWARE EVOLVING INTO A SERVICE RENTED OFF THE NET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If 1999 was the year everyone started saying that Internet-based
software would replace conventional programs, 2000 will surely be
the year the transition begins in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   There are already signs of a major upheaval as the power and
accessibility of the Internet are harnessed to create software that
costs less, does more and is easier to use than today's programs.
Companies increasingly are managing some portion of their employee
communications and customer transactions over the Internet. In
homes, a 24-hour Internet connection is becoming common, and
consumers who might once have bought a calendar program now trust
their agenda to a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   As this trend takes hold over the next decade, shrink-wrapped
boxes of software on CD-ROMs or floppy disks will disappear, and
with them will go a business model based on selling a product.
Rather, software companies will make their money selling a service,
much like utilities sell electricity. Other software will be
invisible, embedded in a host of appliances that bear no
resemblance to a computer, much the way today's automobiles are
rich in processing power and software that the driver never sees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet creates an opportunity to change the way people
manage information technology,'' said Gary Bloom, executive vice
president of the Oracle Corp., the world's second-largest
independent software company. ``I believe nobody will be `buying'
software that they load on their machines. You will buy software as
a service, just the way you buy telephone service today. That is
something you could never do before Internet architecture came
along.''
</P>
<P>
   The world's largest software company, Microsoft Corp., is
finding itself under siege on this front, just as it maneuvers to
resolve the government's long-running antitrust case against it.
Linux, a free operating system created by a Finnish graduate
student, has emerged as a viable alternative to Microsoft's
Windows. And Sun Microsystems has begun offering a productivity
suite, StarOffice, free for the downloading, that is very similar
to Microsoft Office.
</P>
<P>
   Further, dozens of ``application service providers,'' or ASPs,
have sprung up to offer software over the Internet as a
subscription service, no downloading or installation required.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and representatives of the government are currently in
their first round of settlement talks under Richard A. Posner, the
Federal appeals court judge who was selected as a mediator by the
trial judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson of federal district court.
Jackson found last month that the company had used its monopoly
power to stifle innovation, reduce competition and hurt consumers _
a finding that put considerable pressure on Microsoft to settle
within the next couple of months.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts generally believe that given the fast pace of
Internet time, any outcome will be either ineffectual or
irrelevant, because the market itself may eat at Microsoft's
dominance if the Internet software model takes hold with Microsoft
on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, analysts say the move to Internet-based software is
happening far more rapidly than the industry's last major
transition. That was the move, about 10 years ago, to client-server
architectures, in which tasks once performed by giant mainframes or
refrigerator-sized minicomputers were split between desktop
computers and servers distributed throughout an organization.
</P>
<P>
   That system proved unwieldy for many users, but it was a boon to
producers of business and accounting programs, so-called enterprise
resource planning, or ERP, software. Those makers include SAP,
Oracle and Peoplesoft, and of course Microsoft, whose Windows and
Windows NT programs are dominant.
</P>
<P>
   Tectonic technology shifts create openings for new leadership
companies, which is one reason investors have been rushing to back
companies, like Inktomi, that provide the software to creates the
Internet infrastructure for these programs. These companies are not
shy about proclaiming their role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm absolutely convinced that the Inktomi architecture will be
the standard architecture of the Internet, and this architecture is
going to be the architecture of the enterprise as well,'' said
David Peterschmidt, Inktomi's president and chief executive. ``It
is not going to be the enterprise companies coming through the fire
wall to define the Internet. The Internet architecture is going to
go back through the fire wall to define the enterprise.''
</P>
<P>
   In one vision of the new era, the client _ the portion of the
software that resides on the user's desktop computer _ shrinks to
nothing more than a Web browser, which does not require anything so
powerful as a PC to operate. It can get by with a vestigial
operating system that the user never need see. Oracle has already
reworked its core database program and all its applications to work
this way, and many software start-ups are designing their products
in this manner.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle has also begun selling software this way, through its
Business Online unit. The Robert Mondavi Winery, for example,
manages its human resources using software running on servers at
Oracle, and Bloom said many small businesses were now opting to use
programs once intended for large corporations. ``A lot of the
start-up companies are starting out with enterprise-class apps from
the git-go,'' he said. ``If you plan on becoming a $5 billion
company, why start out with Quickbooks?''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Intuit, producer of Quickbooks, an accounting program
for small businesses, is also experimenting with renting software
services over the Web, although so far only with TurboTax, its
personal tax preparation program.
</P>
<P>
   Renting software rather than buying it will fundamentally change
the relationship between vendors and users, said Roger McNamee, a
partner in Integral Capital. ``The ASP model is about sharing risk
between vendor and customer,'' he said. The classic $30 million
client-server application put all the risk on the buyer, and buyers
were loathe to change, even if a program ran poorly because the
money was already spent. The return on investment for the buyer was
often negative, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ASP model changes all that. ``The customer puts it in,''
McNamee said. ``If it works, they continue to pay for it. The
companies that are being optimized for this are the new start-ups,
like MarketSoft and Allegis.'' MarketSoft specializes in managing
sales leads, while Allegis' software is aimed at managing
relationships with partners.
</P>
<P>
   Even a traditional software company now finds itself in the
relationship business. Adobe Systems sells big graphics and
publishing applications, like Photoshop and Illustrator, that run
on a desktop and do not really lend themselves to electronic
distribution at current bandwidth levels. But Adobe also sees the
Web playing a greater role in its business.

TALKING THE FUTURE WITH MARY MEEKER AND JEFF CAMP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just think what the language would be like without the Internet.
Until five or six years ago, ``Amazon'' was a very long, very big
river. ``Yahoo'' was a favorite expression of delight _ or, to
students of Jonathan Swift, a brutish creature. A ``web'' was for
spiders. ``Space'' was _ well, it was space. ``Dot-com,'' ``B2B,''
``e-commerce,'' ``e-mail.'' Whaaa?
</P>
<P>
   Consider the economy, and its Net effects.
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, only 90,000 Americans, mostly academics, were
wired. Today, 80 million people in this country, and nearly 200
million worldwide, are online. Within two years, those numbers
could double.
</P>
<P>
   Online retail sales have risen from nothing to about $20
billion. Business-to-business transactions _ that B2B thing _ have
grown to $109 billion. By 2003, Forrester Research estimates,
online retail sales will grow to $144 billion, and B2B business
e-commerce will jump to $1.3 trillion. (That's just in the United
States, folks.)
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is the stock market. Without the Internet, the
initial public offering market would be pretty dead. Without the
Internet, a slew of day traders might be otherwise engaged. Without
the Internet, the Nasdaq composite index almost certainly would not
be up more than 70 percent this year, and price/earnings ratios
would make a lot more sense.
</P>
<P>
   So much for the past.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, with about six weeks left in the century, Mary
Meeker, head of the Internet research team at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter, and Jeff Camp, who follows Internet data services for the
firm, sat down to talk about the future.
</P>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from the conversation:
</P>
<P>
   Q: There have been more than 200 Internet initial public
offerings this year. Is that pace sustainable in the coming 12
months?
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meeker: As long as the economic environment remains robust,
and as long as new categories of companies keep coming on, it
certainly seems as though it should. I think many people would
welcome a slowdown because each crop of companies is riskier than
the last one. That said, the aggregate opportunity is quite high
for high-risk/high-reward companies.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So what sorts of companies will we see? And how have the
waves gone so far?
</P>
<P>
   A: Increasingly, there will be new infrastructure plays.
Broadband is becoming increasingly real. Providing services to
build that business will be another big opportunity. Wireless is
another one. And many things are needed to provide for a better
user experience across the board. But the B2B theme, general
business re-engineering, will continue to be a big theme.
</P>
<P>
   It is also our view that sometime in the next year a traditional
company will throw out its traditional business model and become
more Internet-like, where it focuses on the long term and gets away
with it. To date, no one has had the guts to do it or has done it
successfully.
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, we have had an infrastructure wave, including
companies like UUnet, PSI and Netccom;a software wave, with
companies like Netscape and Spyglass;a content wave, with companies
like Lycos, Yahoo and Excite, and retail and e-commerce, like CDB
Now and Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Each year a new crop of companies in a new category have
captured peoples' imaginations and created real businesses and real
wealth. Right now we are seeing a lot of opportunity in the
business-to-business area. Two years from now people may be focused
on something else.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there any reason to think that business-to-business
companies will generate profits faster than retailers like
Amazon.com?
</P>
<P>
   A: B2B will probably have a shorter ramp-up to profitability
compared to an e-commerce company like Amazon, if only because
Amazon's ambitions are so vast. And operating losses at these
companies will also probably not reach the level of e-commerce
companies. Right now it is too early to tell which companies are
going to be the big winners on an ongoing basis. One of the reasons
it is tough to predict is that many of these new companies are
looking at the history of the Internet and asking what lessons can
be learned from what has happened in the past. They have their eyes
much more wide open and are adapting a lot more quickly than
companies in the business-to-commerce area.
</P>
<P>
   I would feel comfortable saying that a year from now we will
have a lot more clarity about winners and losers. Often, the
biggest threat is not a market threat or a competitive threat, but
management error. That is something you can't predict.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Which Internet infrastructure companies look promising?
</P>
<P>
   Camp: Four companies are worth highlighting: Exodus, which is
dominant in the high end of the United States Web hosting market;
InterNAP, which provides Internet connectivity services that
greatly increase performance and speed of company Web sites;
Akamai, a pioneer in the market for intelligent content
distribution services; and Verio, the largest Web hosting company
to small and medium-sized businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you were constructing an Internet portfolio you could not
trade at all for the next five years, which stocks would have to be
included?
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meeker: America Online, Yahoo, Amazon.com and Cisco Systems.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Nearly all of these companies, and a good chunk of their
managers, have never lived through a recession. What sort of impact
would a downturn have on Internet companies?
</P>
<P>
   Camp: If you think B2B, businesses are getting online for cogent
economic reasons: It reduces procurement costs; it increases
productivity; inventory management and so forth. It is unlikely
that a recession would derail that overall trend.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meeker: It could accelerate it.
</P>
<P>
   Camp: It may impact what consumers do, but my guess is that the
much larger part of the Internet, which is business-related, is
going to be moving along that trend for the reasons I just
mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   You can make a decent argument that parts of the Internet are
going to be recession-proof. If you are a business going online,
you need a Web site, you need Internet access and all the different
tools and components that go into it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Despite its rapid growth, the move to the Internet is still
in its infancy. Where are we, and how much of a lead does the
United States have on the rest of the industrialized world?
</P>
<P>
   A: It seems as if the Internet is everywhere, but it is really
concentrated in the hands of a group of very large companies.
Ninety percent of large businesses have a Web site or are doing
something on the Web. Ten percent of small businesses do. When you
consider that small businesses represent half the gross domestic
product in this country and represent 99 percent of all businesses,
a large part of the market is not engaged yet.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meeker: In terms of development, Europe is probably where
the United States was in 1995 or 1996. There are a few reasons for
this.
</P>
<P>
   First, personal computer penetration isn't as high as it is in
the United States. Second, telecommunications availability is more
restrictive, and costs are higher. And regional boundaries _
language and other things _ are part of the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   That said, Internet growth is accelerating in those markets.
Financial service companies are more aggressive about online
banking than they have been here. And wireless Internet
connectivity is going to happen faster in Europe than here. That is
a big opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, though, more than half the usage by European
consumers appears to be targeted at American sites. For example, we
believe Yahoo is probably the leading Web site in France, Britain
and Germany. From a content perspective, the Yahoo and America
Online of Europe may be Yahoo and America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It sounds as though experience is a great comparative
advantage. Is that the case?
</P>
<P>
   A: People who wring their hands whenever Amazon's or eBay's or
Schwab's site crashes should remember that those companies are
making mistakes many companies only wish they could make, because
they are servicing so much volume. They get smarter and smarter and
smarter.
</P>
<P>
   Something on the order of 50 percent of all e-commerce knowledge
resides in the brains of Amazon.com employees or Amazon
programmers. They know the patterns when an average American or
foreigner goes online. That knowledge has helped these companies
become so big and to understand how to move into new markets in a
very competitive and aggressive way.
</P>
<P>
   I would not want to compete with Microsoft or Netscape or Yahoo,
or go toe-to-toe with Amazon.com or eBay. The leading companies of
today will not be failures because of start-ups. If they fail, it
will be because they made a tactical error or one of the other
leaders morphs into their business.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Speaking of Microsoft, what do you think is going to happen
with the antitrust case? Will the company be broken up?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think the best thing to happen here is that they settle the
case and go forward.
</P>
<P>
   The focus I have had is on whether an adverse ruling will
fundamentally change the company's business model. But the things
that will fundamentally change Microsoft's business model are
already in place.
</P>
<P>
   For them, the bad news is that they will not have the kind of
market share on the Internet that they had on the personal computer
platform. The good news is that the Internet, whatever it is, is
much bigger, and they are in a position where they potentially
could have smaller market shares in many markets, so that might not
be such a bad thing.

RISE OF INTERNET CHANGES ROLE OF PERSONAL COMPUTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1999 it became fashionable to predict the end of the PC era.
</P>
<P>
   At the vast Comdex personal computer trade show in Las Vegas in
November, the buzz seemed to be about everything but the personal
computer.
</P>
<P>
   There was hype about Web pads _ handy, wireless slates for
surfing the Web, in effect portable computers with screen but
without keyboard. And there was more hype about devices other than
computers that provide Web access.
</P>
<P>
   Even Bill Gates, the Microsoft chairman who is high priest of
the PC, took time out from his presentation to showcase what he
called a Web companion, a computer that eschews the Windows
operating system in gaining access to the Web. It looks much like
the ``network appliance'' that Gates once reviled when it was first
proposed by his company's rivals, Sun Microsystems and Oracle Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The most hoopla of all surrounded a coming generation of
cellular phones that are part phone and part computer and will
allow mobile users to surf the Web and do everything from shopping
to making restaurant reservations from wherever they are.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the PCs on display, whose makers seemed focused
on repackaging their machines in different-colored boxes, appeared
drab and uninspired.
</P>
<P>
   It has begun to seem that like the mainframe computer, the
venerable PC may be on the verge of being supplanted _ by more
powerful technologies promising quick and easy access to the
Internet through devices that are highly portable, less costly and
readily adopted by non-PC users.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, hot Silicon Valley companies like Phone.com, the
telephone Web browser company based in Redwood City, Calif., are
reporting gleefully that beginning next year, almost half the
cellular phones sold will come equipped with the ability to surf
the Web. Moreover, they predict that at the current growth rate,
the number of Web browsers in phones will exceed the number in PCs
in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt that personal mobile communication is going
to happen,'' said Greg Galanos, a software strategist at Motorola.
``The fact that you're chained to the desk to do electronic mail
makes no sense at all today.''
</P>
<P>
   If using the Internet rather than spreadsheets and word
processors is driving the growth of the personal computer industry,
then mobile access to the Internet is likely to dominate in short
order. Who could possibly argue that surfing the Web while trapped
sitting in a chair at a desk is natural or inevitable?
</P>
<P>
   The one flaw in this argument is that PC sales are not
shrinking. PC industry growth has been in double-digit figures for
six years, and it is expected to strengthen this year to 20.6
percent, near the 21.3 percent increase posted for 1994-95,
according to Dataquest, the market research firm based in San Jose,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   In his keynote address this year at Comdex, Gates boasted that
industry analysts have underestimated industry growth for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Year after year, people look at the personal computer and
think: `Wow! It must have reached its peak,''' he said. ``There
hasn't been a year that analysts haven't said: `Well, this is
really it. Boy, the growth has been so fantastic over the last
year. This has got to be where it cuts off.'''
</P>
<P>
   Gates' view is shared by Steven Jobs, a rival who became a
nominal ally after Microsoft invested in Apple Computer in 1997.
Jobs has argued forcefully in the last two years that there is no
reason to assume that innovation _ and thus growth _ is dead in the
PC world.
</P>
<P>
   To underscore his point, Apple's new iBook portable personal
computer became the top-selling portable in November. The machine
has a built-in antenna and permits a user to easily insert a card,
costing about $100, to provide high-speed wireless connections.
</P>
<P>
   Continued growth is a strong argument in favor of the PC, but
the same argument was made by defenders of the mainframe computer
in the late 1980s, shortly before that industry began its collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with defending the PC in this debate is that the
rise of the Internet has changed the role of the PC. Rather than an
end in itself, the PC is now merely one of a variety of Internet
entry points.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advent of the Internet has shifted the focus of the
industry from `personal computing' to the Internet and
e-business,'' said Irving Wladasky-Berger, general manager of IBM
Corp.'s Internet division. ``The glamour is all in the Internet and
e-business.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the attack on the PC industry may soon be joined on
the videogame front. In an editorial last month titled ``A Billion
Connected PCs? Guess Again,'' the editors of Microprocessor Report,
an influential semiconductor industry newsletter, took issue with
Intel Corp.'s view that PCs will continue to dominate ``personal
computing'' in the future.
</P>
<P>
   They pointed out that two big Japanese consumer electronics
companies, Sony and Nintendo, have both placed billion-dollar-plus
bets on semiconductor factories to build a new generation of chips
that may be more powerful than the fastest Intel microprocessors.
</P>
<P>
   Sony is readying its PlayStation 2, while Nintendo is developing
a new system, code-named Dolphin. Using the new chips, both of
these machines will probably be part videogame player, part
Internet appliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which would you rather have in your living room: a Windows 98
PC or a Sony PlayStation 2?'' the Microprocessor Report editorial
asks. ``For most people, the PlayStation 2 is a better choice.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, computers are almost certain to become like
electric motors. Once upon a time, it was envisioned that one
electric motor, equipped with pulleys and cables, would run
appliances all through the house. Instead, there are now electric
motors in every appliance.
</P>
<P>
   With computing, ``I think it's more of a morphing,'' Galanos of
Motorola said. ``The fine line between the PC industry and the
consumer electronics industry will increasingly vanish.''
</P>
<P>
   If it is ending, the PC era has been a remarkable two decades.
From its roots in a hobbyist subculture populated by a handful of
long-haired engineers who hungered for their own machines, the
personal computer exploded to create powerful industrial
monopolies. But Moore's Law _ that the number of transistors on a
microchip will double every year and a half _ ensures that no
computing era will last forever, not even that of the PC.

<TEXT>
<P>
   To glimpse the future intersection between industry and the
Internet, peer not into a crystal ball but inside Cisco Systems
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   What is notable is how the high-technology company sells its
routers, hardware essential to the distribution of Internet
traffic. From its headquarters in San Jose, Calif., Cisco sells
roughly $12 billion of products a year over the Internet _
representing fully 85 percent of its business _ to customers who
shop, order and receive technical support online.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco uses a network internally, too. Employees file expense
reports, handle procurement, receive training and deal with 401(k)
plans and health benefit changes on an internal computer network
that saves paper, time and management resources, a marked change in
the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before long, other companies are going to look like Cisco
looks today,'' said Greg Wood, spokesman for Internet2, a
next-generation, high-speed network being developed by universities
and industry.
</P>
<P>
   Future developments in the Internet regarding business _ and the
lauded concept of e-commerce _ should come in waves. The next wave,
perhaps one to two years out, will find traditional businesses
increasingly gravitating, like Cisco, to making sales and doing
procurement online, and to dealing with human resource matters on
internal networks, so-called intranets.
</P>
<P>
   But those who are studying the relationship between business and
the still-primitive and slow Internet say that the waves that will
follow in five or 10 years will be much more powerful and could
well reshape the way business is conducted.
</P>
<P>
   This transformation will happen because, very basically but
profoundly, the Internet permits ease and breadth of communication,
provides newfound mobility and allows complex transactions to take
place among numerous parties in far-flung regions. Although this
may sound like yet more hyperbolic praise for technology,
researchers like Stuart I. Feldman, director of the Institute of
Advanced Commerce at IBM, say these Internet assets could lead to a
new type of marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Feldman, echoing a view shared by numerous researchers, suggests
that in the next decade, huge, far-flung, industry-specific
marketplaces will emerge _ for food or clothing, for example. In
these marketplaces, the lines between individual businesses will
become blurred as companies find new and unusual ways, both
competitive and cooperative, to serve customers.
</P>
<P>
   The vision is that these Internet-based marketplaces will act
like a combination of ancient barter-based marketplaces and
Internet auctions. Consumers, whether individuals or businesses,
will submit requests for products over the Internet, and businesses
from around the world will vie to fill their orders, competing on
service, price, quality and other features. In some cases, however,
businesses may collaborate to fill orders, or turn to 3rd, 4th or
10th parties to join in elaborate barter deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future of the marketplace harks back to the old-fashioned
marketplace, or market ground,'' Feldman said. ``People got
together; they argued; they traded things.''
</P>
<P>
   But the new markets will not be so limited as those on the
fields of ancient Greece. In a cyberspace environment, they will
increasingly use video and become more mobile. Buyers may
point-and-click their orders on a personal digital assistant
whether they are trading stocks, bales of hay or tons of steel.
</P>
<P>
   Feldman said he could imagine a consumer, while returning from
work, instructing his portable device to find him the best deal for
groceries on the route home. ``You'll say you need a pound of
hamburger, two fresh onions and a bottle of ketchup _ who will sell
this to me near here in the next hour?'' Feldman said. ``All the
markets in the area will be screaming: `Me! Me!'''
</P>
<P>
   An early example of the marriage of mobility, networks and
commerce is an experiment IBM is conducting in England in
partnership with Safeway PLC, the supermarket chain. There, IBM has
given 170 shoppers Palm Pilots equipped with scanners and modems.
The shoppers can punch in their grocery orders and the devices
automatically send the orders to Safeway to be packed for the
customers. A shopper can also restock the home larder by running
the scanner over the bar code on items on hand (a can of peaches,
say, or napkins).
</P>
<P>
   The purchase of Coca-Cola from vending machines in Finland
illustrates another example of new technology at work. In an
experiment, using software made by the Oracle Corp., a consumer
punches an order for a soda into a cellular phone. The phone then
instructs the vending machine to kick out a Coke and debits an
account to pay for it. (Of course, those without cell phones may go
thirsty.) In addition, the vending machine, which is also on a
network, dials its owner when it is time to be restocked with soda.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle, based in Redwood City, Calif., knows whereof it speaks
when it comes to network possibilities. Like Cisco, it is
considered to be on the cutting edge and a model for the near-term
changes expected in many industries. But companies looking to
emulate Oracle should know that the company had to undergo a
substantial transformation to get to this point.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the company relied on in-person product-demonstration
seminars that cost $350 per attendee to stage, including
invitations, hotel space, special crews and more. Today, the
company holds the majority of its seminars online _ it had 61
online presentations in October, for example, presenting material
in text, video and audio, and taking questions via e-mail. The
cost: $1.98 per attendee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking a factor of even 100 less; we're talking a
huge amount less'' in cost, said Mark Jarvis, senior vice president
for worldwide marketing for Oracle. ``We were used to running
marketing seminars in 144 countries worldwide. Now we do one for
the entire globe.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Cisco, Oracle has also moved many of its human resource
tasks online. For example, an employee files an expense report into
an automated system that not only e-mails the report to a manager
to approve, but also checks the report for any anomalous expenses
that could lead to an audit. Jarvis said it cost $100 to process a
paper-based expense report, but $1 for one in a digital
network-based world.
</P>
<P>
   Like Feldman of IBM, Jarvis predicts that this wave of
networking technology will look insignificant compared with the
waves on the horizon. He said that Oracle and other companies
needed to prepare themselves for a world in which geography and
price were far less significant in buying and selling decisions,
and that businesses must prepare themselves to compete against and
cooperate with other businesses in a virtual environment with few
boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is looking at putting their product catalog online
and thinking, `I'm done,''' said Mark A. Tonnesen, a senior
director of information technology at Cisco Systems. ``But you've
got to think about having an entire ecosystem of products and
services online.'' The world ahead, he said, is one ``with multiple
buyers, multiple customers and multiple complementary processes.''

   What's past is prologue for our millennium party. We're
celebrating with dishes that can be served at a sit-down meal or as
components on a party buffet. Their other commonality is that all
of these victuals have been around for centuries _ sometimes much
as we know them today, often in a much less evolved state.
</P>
<P>
   1070: Roquefort cheese first made in France. (Some historians
put the date 200 years earlier and say that Roman emperor
Charlemagne was a fan.)
</P>
<P>
   1493: Christopher Columbus finds papayas, tomatoes and
pineapples, cultivated for centuries from Paraguay to Panama, in
the West Indies.
</P>
<P>
   1493: Columbus plants sugar cane and cucumbers on Santo Domingo
(Hispaniola) with seeds from the Canary Islands.

   CHERRY TOMATOES WITH ROQUEFORT AND WATERCRESS
</P>
<P>
   Yields 24
</P>
<P>
   24 cherry tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   2 ounces Roquefort cheese
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 tablespoons canola oil
</P>
<P>
   1 small bunch watercress, leaves coarsely chopped to yield about
1/2 cup, plus more for garnish
</P>
<P>
   1 small seedless cucumber, finely diced to make 1/3 cup
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon snipped fresh chives
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Using a serrated knife, slice about 1/8 inch from top of each
tomato. If tomato doesn't sit upright, trim a tiny piece from the
uncut side to create a flat bottom. (Don't cut off too much or the
filling will leak out.) With tip of a knife, gently loosen flesh
around inside of each tomato. Scoop out seeds with small melon
baller. The tomatoes can be prepared 1 hour in advance and kept at
room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   In food processor, combine vinegar and half of the cheese. Pulse
until smooth. Slowly add oil, blending until smooth and thick.
(Consistency will be thinner than mayonnaise.) Transfer mixture to
medium bowl. Stir in all but 2 tablespoons of the cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Just before serving, fold in watercress, cucumber and chives.
Season with salt and pepper to taste. Use a small spoon to fill
cherry tomatoes with mixture. Garnish with watercress leaves and
reserved cheese and serve.

</P>
<P>
   1959: The FDA seizes a fraction of the cranberry crop because of
pesticide residue. Although only a minuscule amount of
contamination was found, consumers avoided cranberries that
Thanksgiving. Devastated by the loss (at the time, cranberries were
solely an autumnal dish) the cranberry industry began looking for
other outlets for its crops. That move led to cranberry juice and,
in the 1990s, craisins.

IN FINAL YEAR 2000 TESTING, FOCUS IS ON SMALLEST FLAWS 
</HEADLINE>

   WALTHAM, Mass. _ The strings of letters and numbers flashing on
his computer screen were unintelligible to Kishore Parwani, but he
knew that each was the name of a computer program with hundreds or
even thousands of lines of code. He also knew something was wrong
because the screen was telling him the code was free of Year 2000
faults, a result as believable as a report that a unicorn had won
the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   The programs, sent by one of the nation's largest commercial
real estate companies for testing by Data Integrity Inc., had been
certified as Year 2000-ready by the large software company that
created them. But Data Integrity and other companies that review
code to verify software claims typically find scores, even hundreds
of serious oversights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our best clients still have 40 to 50 errors per millions of
lines of code,'' said Richard E. Evans, an analyst with Meta Group
of Stamford, Conn., a consulting firm that provides information on
verification tools and services. ``Half of those could corrupt data
or crash systems.''
</P>
<P>
   That adds up to thousands of potentially serious flaws for
banks, insurance companies and others.
</P>
<P>
   The government and most of corporate America have declared that
virtually all of their critical systems will function normally when
Jan. 1 arrives. But because only a portion of most computer code is
actually tested to make sure the year ``00'' will be correctly
interpreted, even the most confident computer managers anticipate
at least minor flaws.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, as the repairs and testing wind up, Year 2000 is boiling
down to one pressing question: Since stamping out every Year 2000
date problem is impossible, have they at least reduced the caseload
of miscalculations and crashes to manageable levels?
</P>
<P>
   For the real estate company, the mirage of clean code
disappeared when Parwani adjusted his scanning tactics for the
obscure code in which the program was written. A three-day review
of close to 2.5 million lines of the software vendor's supposedly
Year 2000-ready code identified about 250 flaws.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found at least 10 flaws that would have required several
days to fix,'' said a programmer for the real estate company, which
allowed a reporter to observe the procedure on the condition that
it not be identified. ``They would not have stopped business but
they might have interfered with things like tracking how long rents
are overdue.''
</P>
<P>
   While true showstoppers rarely turn up in such inspections, the
number of flaws uncovered naturally raises questions about whether
the government and many corporations are overstating their
readiness.
</P>
<P>
   The prevailing confidence is probably justified as far as the
New Year's weekend goes, but the longer-term picture is murkier,
according to verification-tool providers like Data Integrity. As
with software flaws in general, system crashes are usually less
troublesome than malfunctions that generate faults that are not be
immediately apparent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Less than 10 percent of the problems we find would cause
something to stop,'' said Scott Hilson, director of technical
support for Reasoning Inc., a Palo Alto, Calif.-based rival of Data
Integrity. ``This is more like termites than an earthquake.''
</P>
<P>
   The Year 2000 termites might be more dangerous than normal bugs
because signs of the infestation are expected to peak in the first
few weeks of January, when many computer workers are already
stretched thin handling malfunctions that occur as the old year
ends and the new one begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anywhere from 2 percent to 5 percent of computer jobs normally
fail in late December and early January,'' Evans of Meta Group
said. That rate will more than double this year, according to
projections by The Gartner Group, a technology consulting firm in
Stamford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, thanks to the Year 2000 challenge, even the
normal problems are likely to be more common in coming weeks. In
addition to the Year 2000 flaws, programmers will be wrestling with
other errors inadvertently added to the code during repair efforts.
Based on an examination of 30 years of softward records, Capers
Jones, chairman of Softward Productivity Research Inc. in
Burlington, Mass., predicts that Year 2000 workers have introduced
seven flaws for every 100 they fixed.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, many computer users bought new software to retire
programs that had date problems. But newly installed software tends
to have more bugs than average.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, vendors like Data Integrity have found contracts
harder to come by than analysts had originally projected. Total
sales for the tools have probably reached about $200 million,
according to industry estimates, but expectations had been higher.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The tools are generally modified versions of programs that find
and repair date flaws. One of their biggest selling points, beyond
blazing speed, is that they scan every line in a program. By
contrast, although running test programs provides a better window
on real-world use, such tests require intricate scripts _ and even
complex simulations, like those conducted by Wall Street in March
and April, can exercise only a small percentage of a large user's
code.
</P>
<P>
   Most verification tools start with vast glossaries of all terms
that might be used for dates in coding and for operations using
them, like tracking how many days a payment is overdue.
</P>
<P>
   Data Integrity's approach is somewhat different. It looks not
for date terms but for coding that indicates a mathematical
operation, like ``compare.'' It then tries to filter out commands
that could not involve Year 2000 errors. But regardless of
approach, users generally pay for verification tools based on the
number of lines of code that will be scanned.
</P>
<P>
   Rates generally run between four to 10 cents a line, with a
typical contract covering hundreds of thousands of lines at a
minimum. ``Price can be a sticking point for some smaller
organizations,'' said Allen Burgess, a software engineer who
founded Data In- tegrity in 1984 as a software develop- ment and
consulting company. He added that Data Integrity's contracts have
run from $90,000 to more than $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Analysts estimate that the big computer users in the United
States with comprehensive Year 2000 programs have used either tools
or human checks on 40 to 60 percent of their repaired code. ``Once
you get outside the U.S. and a few countries, you get down to
single digits in how much of the code has been independently
verified,'' Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   The first generation of automated Year 2000 tools in the
mid-1990s was difficult to use. The tools frequently overwhelmed
programmers with lists of potential glitches that on closer
inspection had nothing to do with dates. Many computer users turned
instead to so-called body shops like IBM, CAP Gemini and Keane,
which relied more heavily on human programmers than automation for
verifying code.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the tools now have better filters, but programmers
acquainted with how the code is used must still determine which of
the flaws are worth investigating.
</P>
<P>
   As Data Integrity's contract with the real estate company
demonstrated, the independent verification business has not dried
up even though January is just around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   But many prospective clients are suffering from ``Y2K fatigue,''
Burgess said. ``At the end of October, they started saying it was
too late to do anything more.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Today, the rooms in Data Integrity's office in a business park
near Route 128 outside Boston are mostly empty. But it is not
because the company is shriveling as demand for its main product
slows. The office is a new one that the company moved into
anticipating adding to its staff of 30 next year as its tools, like
those of its rivals, are adapted to cleaning up other faults in
software. Thanks to Year 2000, they should get at least a chance to
make pitches to most of the world's biggest computer users.

LIKE KAUFMAN, `MAN ON THE MOON' CONFOUNDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Playing comedian Andy Kaufman, Jim Carrey pulls a Cheshire-cat
act in ``Man on the Moon:'' Everything about Carrey vanishes except
for his overbite. Detractors might call Carrey's performance a
stunt or mere impersonation, but it goes deeper than that.
</P>
<P>
   To see Carrey morph into Kaufman, the unconventional entertainer
from the late '70s and early '80s, is to see complete
transformation. But it's when Carrey takes on Kaufman's characters
_ the inept comedian ``Foreign Man,'' the obnoxious lounge singer
Tony Clifton, and, of course, Elvis _ that the depth and breadth of
the performance becomes clear. When those who remember Kaufman
forget that it's Carrey on screen, when the people who knew Kaufman
say that the resemblance is uncanny, that's when you know how much
Carrey has given himself to this role.
</P>
<P>
   Reportedly, Carrey remained in character 24-7 while he was on
the set, and that does seem excessive. But it's a sign of his
passion for this role, a passion that was so strong that the
in-demand Carrey was willing to audition _ and beat out actors as
strong as Nicolas Cage _ to play Kaufman. Passion, in fact,
surrounds this movie _ it's just not always there on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   It's tempting to speculate what the real-life Kaufman would have
thought of ``Man on the Moon'' and its attendant hype. For the past
couple of weeks, it's seemed like every time you turn on late-night
TV, someone connected to the movie was plugging it on a talk show
(who would have thought, when R.E.M.'s dense, seminal ``Murmur''
was released shortly before Kaufman died, that lead singer Michael
Stipe would spend the turn of the century shilling a major-studio
movie?). Kaufman might have been appalled at this commercialism,
but he was as much huckster as hoaxer, and he might have admired
the showmanship inherent in the buildup.
</P>
<P>
   But Kaufman's pranksterism would probably have led him to pull
the rug out from under the audience, defying expectations with,
say, two hours of Jim Carrey reading ``The Great Gatsby.'' Kaufman
was not afraid to be infuriatingly boring, if it meant being
unpredictable; ``Man on the Moon'' is never boring, but it can be
frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for the answers to what made Kaufman tick,
don't come here; director Milos Forman and screenwriters Scott
Alexander and Larry Karaszewski take an almost A&AMP;E Biography,
and-then-he-did-this approach to Kaufman's career. The movie's
beginning, a piece of minor brilliance with Carrey as Foreign Man
introducing the film, leads you to believe that wilder things will
be in store (this is one time that it will pay to show up on time
for a movie), but what follows is a more conventional film than
you'd expect from the writers and director of ``The People vs.
Larry Flynt.''
</P>
<P>
   Which may be wise; Kaufman was an enigma, and according to his
friend and co-writer Bob Zmuda's book ``Andy Kaufman Revealed!,''
even the people closest to Kaufman were never entirely able to
figure him out. Perhaps that's why the movie concentrates most on
Kaufman's career, downplaying his interpersonal relationships with
people such as Zmuda (''Saving Private Ryan's'' Paul Giamatti),
manager George Shapiro (Danny DeVito) and understanding girlfriend
Lynne Margulies (Courtney Love, in an underwritten role).
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many directors fascinated with pop culture, Forman is
interested in the phenomenon itself, and not in using it as a form
of ironic joke (Alexander and Karazsewski, who also wrote ``Ed
Wood,'' are his perfect kindred spirits). But in ``Man on the
Moon,'' he does more observing than interpreting. The movie has a
lot of the what of Kaufman's life, but not that much of the why _
not just the why of what drove him to bait audiences, but the why
of what drove audiences to swallow the bait, despite Kaufman's
sometimes obvious contempt. The buzz behind ``Man on the Moon''
will draw audiences to it, and Carrey's astonishing performance
will be their reward. But although they might leave it satisfied,
they'll leave it with more questions than answers.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
Keep Windows 2000 in mind when buying or upgrading 
By Bill Husted  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ While normal people are getting ready for the
holidays, the real geeks and wireheads among us have started
thinking about getting home computers ready for Windows 2000, the
coming edition of Windows that should be released early in the new
year.
</P>
<P>
   I've been using beta copies of 2000 for several months now. It's
not really fair to critique Windows based on test copies, since the
whole idea of a beta test is to find problems and bugs in the
software. But, all in all, it seems as if it will be (and it should
be) better than Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   Based on my experience, here are some things that will help you
get ready for Windows 2000 if you're thinking of buying a new
computer or upgrading the one that you have.
</P>
<P>
   Memory: Windows 95 and 98 used memory a lot better than Windows
3.1, but both are still flawed. For technical reasons that would
take too long to explain, some computers running these versions of
Windows actually slowed down after much more than 64 megabytes of
RAM were installed. Windows 2000 is built on the more robust
backbone of Windows NT (the industrial strength version of Windows)
and handles memory a lot better. It also seems to need more memory.
I'd suggest 128 megabytes of RAM.
</P>
<P>
   Accessories: Not every accessory that you are now using with
Windows 95 or 98 will work with Windows 2000. That applies even to
brand-new devices. For instance, just weeks ago I got a demo
version of a new game controller that plugs into the joystick port.
It won't work with Windows 2000. A smart buyer would know in
advance, since the package clearly stated that the controller
wasn't compatible with Windows NT (and, as I said, that's the
framework Windows 2000 is built on). So if you're shopping for
accessories, check the package to make sure that they'll work with
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Software: It's the same story here. Not all of your software
will work with Windows 2000. When you install 2000, the program
does a good job of identifying the programs on its list of
incompatible programs.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a tip, though. Many of the programs that 2000 flagged as
incompatible ran just fine, so don't delete those old programs
without actually trying them. And when you buy new software, look
on the package to make sure that it's Windows 2000 compatible.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the important ``gotchas'' to think about. But there
are some other things to keep in mind. These apply to any computer
running Windows.
</P>
<P>
   USB: That stands for universal serial bus port. Windows 98 and
Window 2000 support this technology, and it's a vast improvement
over the way things used to be. It's much easier to install new
equipment on a computer equipped with USB. You simply plug it in,
and it works. You can plug and unplug the device while the computer
is running, without a bunch of rebooting and reconfiguring. I've
literally never had a moment's trouble installing a USB device. You
can be sure that your new computer will have USB ports. I highly
recommend that _ when you're buying a new scanner, printer or other
device _ you get the USB version.
</P>
<P>
   Video cards: Most people don't know what computer gamers have
understood for a long time. A good video card can speed up your
computer at least as much as going to the next-fastest processor
chip. Even if you're not a gamer, make sure the next video card you
buy has at least 16 megabytes of onboard RAM. My own video card has
32 megabytes of RAM and _ even on my now-antique 350-megahertz
Pentium II machine at home _ things fly.
</P>
<P>
   One last thing to keep in mind. Windows 98 will be around for a
while. There is no law that says you have to buy and install
Windows 2000. But, since most of us probably will move to it
someday, it's smart to keep its requirements in mind when you buy a
new computer or upgrade the old one.

Store data online, at no cost By Bill Husted c.1999 Cox News
Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you've ever needed to wipe your hard disk
completely clean and didn't have a Zip drive or other offline
storage device for stashing the information, you already know what
a hassle it is to back up all that data onto floppy disks.
</P>
<P>
   Now there's a way to get 300 megabytes of storage for free. You
can use it for whatever you like, and the uses are limited to times
when you need to reformat the disk.
</P>
<P>
   This storage is furnished by a Web site, so that means that your
most precious information would remain safe, even if your computer
were destroyed by fire. Businesses have used off-site storage for
years, and the Internet is filled with sites that offer storage.
</P>
<P>
   But this site is different in a couple of ways. You get the 300
megabytes of storage free, and this site is aimed directly at
Macintosh owners. Simply go to the site at FreeMacSpace.com,
register and the space is yours.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what the site's organizer had to say:
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtual hard drives for the Macintosh community are a perfect
match for Apple's iMac users and for the large community of
designers and artists who use high-end Macs,'' said Ari Freeman,
co-founder and chief strategic officer at FreeDiskSpace.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the iMac, iBook, G3 and G4 computers do not ship with a
floppy drive, our virtual hard drives provide these users with an
easy and free solution to securely store and, if they choose, share
any type of file they wish. Mac-based designers who commonly work
with large files will find storing, sharing and collaboration of
files to be as simple as turning on their computers.''
</P>
<P>
   The site also advertises itself as a place to stash important
files in case the Y2K glitch bites. But as a Macintosh owner, you
are almost certainly safe. Unlike PCs, most Macintoshes are
Y2K-proof. Apple says its recent models are safe until 29940 A.D.,
and chances are you'll need a new Mac by then.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, working antiques like the Apple II may not be so
bulletproof. Some of these machines are still doing honest work. If
you're using one, you may want to back up your information, just in
case.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, although you're probably safe from Y2K woes, some of you
may enjoy the New Year more if you've backed up your most important
files and stored them away on this site.
</P>
<P>
   The company also announced virtual hard drives _ at separate
sites _ for other systems including PC, Linux and personal digital
assistants.
</P>
<P>
   The site promises good security as far as protecting your
information.

Graphire mouse is fit and functional By James Cummings c. 1999 Cox
News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The mouses _ or is it mice? _ that come with computers are
functional, but they can have problems.
</P>
<P>
   The cord gets tangled, the little rolling ball gets gummed up
and stops working smoothly and a mouse isn't a good tool for
drawing.
</P>
<P>
   Wacom Technology Corp. of Vancouver, British Columbia, is
marketing an inexpensive cordless mouse and pen set that gets
around those problems. The Graphire cordless system sells for about
$100 and incorporates many of the features of Wacom's more
expensive tools for computer graphic artists.
</P>
<P>
   The system is only compatible with recent computer systems. It
operates with a personal computer with serial port on Windows 95 or
later or Windows 4.0 or later. The Graphire version with USB
connections requires Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   For Macintoshes, an iMac with USB and Mac OS 8.5 or Power
Macintosh with USB port and Mac OS 8.0 or later are required.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of plugging the mouse into the computer as with a
regular setup, the mouse pad of the Graphire is connected. Because
the mouse pad doesn't move around much, the connecting cable
doesn't get tangled.
</P>
<P>
   The lightweight cordless mouse operates like any other mouse; as
you move it, the cursor on the screen moves. Wacom claims, though,
that the Graphire is two to three times more accurate than an
ordinary mouse.
</P>
<P>
   The Graphire mouse also comes with a scrolling wheel that allows
you to move documents up and down on the computer screen. It has an
extra button that can be programmed.
</P>
<P>
   The pen that comes with Graphire also can be used with word
processing programs, but it's most useful in graphics applications.
It can be used in painting, photo editing, writing text longhand or
anything else you might do with a pen or paintbrush.
</P>
<P>
   The software that comes with Graphire includes Painter Classic,
which is supposed to emulate traditional art tools such as chalks,
oil paints and more.
</P>
<P>
   The product is available online direct from Wacom. The company
said it is also available at Comp USA stores. For ordering
information visit www.wacom.com or call (800) 922-6613.

IBM's 1480 ThinkPad puts whistles atop bells &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I'm writing this on the finest laptop computer I've
ever used, but curiously a lot of the high-end bells and whistles
built into IBM's Model 1480 ThinkPad don't have anything to do with
computing.
</P>
<P>
   The 1480, apparently, has reached the limits of the mobile
computing envelope. Oh, I'm sure that you can get plenty of laptops
that run a little faster _ the 1480 is, after all, running on an
Intel Celeron chip of a mere 466 MHz _ but you'd be hard-pressed to
notice it.
</P>
<P>
   It's got a 6-meg hard drive, 14.5-inch LCD display with an ATI
video card that has 4 megabytes of RAM, 64 megs of memory, and a
DVD drive along with a floppy drive.
</P>
<P>
   The modem is a Lucent Technologies V.90 model that achieved 48k
and better on my telephone line.
</P>
<P>
   None of that constitutes bells and whistles; it's just good
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for the bells and whistles, my favorites first:
</P>
<P>
   On the edge of the lid, there's a little light. Turn it on in
the daylight, and you won't even see it. But turn it on in the
dark, and it provides just enough light to let you read the
keyboard. Now, you might think that's silly, and I probably would
have agreed a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   But this past summer I had to write an article on deadline in
the passenger seat of a car flying down Interstate 85 in the dead
of night. No problem, I suppose, for an accomplished typist, but
I'm not one of those, and I doubt a lot of laptop users are. The
National Security Agency would have been hard-pressed to decode the
results of that adventure. This little light would have been a
blessing.
</P>
<P>
   Next is the Internet scroll bar, a big paddle kind of thing
right behind the small paddle things that serve as mouse buttons on
the deck in front of the keyboard. You can use this paddle in
conjunction with the mouse stick to scroll through Web pages
without having to stay on the scroll bars. That's very nice, but
why not extend it to internal applications as well?
</P>
<P>
   Then you've got the four color-coded buttons above the keyboard.
These are preset to use various functions of the Web services IBM
and Lycos have created, but you can customize them to do anything
you wish.
</P>
<P>
   There's a built-in microphone, and also a microphone jack.
</P>
<P>
   Now for the flashy stuff.
</P>
<P>
   At the front of the deck, protrudinga bit so it can still be
used when the computer is turned off and the lid is closed, are
controls and a little window to let you play music disks, or even
DVD movies, through the S-video output to a television set. Oh,
wow.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, at extra cost but what the heck, you can buy
optional covers for the 1480 in seven different colors, not all of
which, one assumes, are blue.
</P>
<P>
   Along with all of these wonders, of course you have the
inescapable evils of all laptops: disagreeable cursor control
devices and a cramped keyboard. The video display can be viewed
quite well from any angle in any light. However, the brightness and
contrast controls had little, if any, effect on it.
</P>
<P>
   As mentioned, IBM has opted for the mouse stick in the middle of
the keyboard instead of the little trackball or the little panel
you diddle with your finger. I don't like any of these. There is,
of course, a standard mouse port for those situations in which you
can use one.
</P>
<P>
   The keyboard is less cramped than many, and most of the keys are
where you expect to find them. And, of course, you can plug in a
standard keyboard when you wish.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, you have the price _ $2,200 _ which is roughly twice
what you might pay for the same features in a desktop, but about
half what a top-of-the-line laptop would have cost a couple of
years ago. Computing on the go will always command a premium, I
suppose.

Software helps stockbrokers catch false claims in e-mail &HT;    By Andrew Park
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A sure thing!
</P>
<P>
   A guaranteed winner!
</P>
<P>
   100 percent safe!
</P>
<P>
   These words make frequent appearances in spam, the junk e-mail
we hate to get, usually followed by some supposedly unbeatable
offer to invest in a stock. Often, it's not clear where the
messages come from.
</P>
<P>
   But for reputable stockbrokers, they are words to avoid. In
fact, it is illegal for registered representatives of brokerage
houses to use phrases such as ``a sure thing'' in cyberspace,
according to the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
National Association of Securities Dealers, which last year issued
a notice to that effect.
</P>
<P>
   Brokers, who have been notoriously slow to accept the influence
of the Internet on their business, now have a huge burden: watching
e-mail to make sure the wrong words aren't delivered into a
client's inbox.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, the (regulators) have said, `You've got to watch
over e-mail,''' said Edward Pecelli, a broker with Horner, Townsend
and Kent, a 1,400-representative brokerage in Horsham, Pa. ``You've
got to put a surveillance process into place.''
</P>
<P>
   That burden has become an opportunity for Amicus Inc., an Austin
software company that designs Web-based tools for financial
services companies, especially independent brokerages. Packaging
them with extranets, Amicus began selling a surveillance system
that throws up virtual red flags when noncompliant language appears
in an e-mail from a representative to a client.
</P>
<P>
   While Amicus has sold the application to only about a half-dozen
of its roughly 30 clients, the company is predicting it will become
more popular as more companies are faced with audits of their
communications by the SEC. Bigger investment houses have charged
their internal information technology departments with developing
similar applications.
</P>
<P>
   But the independent broker-dealers that are Amicus' customers
often can't afford a big outlay to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``They now get stuck with a job they weren't prepared to deal
with,'' said Dennis Passovoy, chief executive of Amicus. ``When
they get audited, they get told, `Figure out a way to deal with it.
Either come up with a manual system or come up with an automated
system.' That's when we get the phone call.''
</P>
<P>
   Misrepresentations by salespeople were the most common cause for
complaints that investors made to the SEC last year, and electronic
misrepresentations are becoming increasingly common.
</P>
<P>
   But for years, e-mails from brokers to clients were not governed
by the same rules that prohibit written statements that claim a
guaranteed return on investment. Typically, brokers submit copies
of letters to their compliance departments to ensure they are not
violating rules that forbid promising that a risky investment will
pay off.
</P>
<P>
   Amicus' ToolBelt 98-11 _ named for NASD Notice 98-11, which
alerted the securities industry to the rule change _ uses a search
engine to look for about 600 problem words, such as ``guarantee''
and ``promise,'' in outgoing e-mail from a company's system.
</P>
<P>
   With ToolBelt, noncompliant messages automatically come to the
attention of administrators before they are sent, avoiding rule
violations but without the need for a time-consuming physical
review of messages. The system can also create an archive of
messages for up to seven years that can be examined randomly or
specifically for noncompliance.
</P>
<P>
   Pecelli said the extranet that Amicus established for his
company two years ago also gives his brokers an opportunity to draw
on the firm's resources remotely at any time.
</P>
<P>
   A common characteristic of Amicus' customers, which make up
about 10 percent of all independent brokerage houses, is a thin
operating margin that doesn't allow for large-scale computing
applications.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a perfect market for the type of out-source technology
that we provide, in part because their margins are so thin, they
don't have the resources to develop these technologies
themselves,'' said Passovoy. ``Under their own power they're not as
able to adopt technologies as fast as other industries.''

MP3.com, Slate flourished during a notable Web year &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ End-of-the-year lists are as inevitable as death and
taxes. At the end of the century, it's a good thing the Web isn't
1,000 years old or even 10. This subjective list of 1999's notable
Web achievements won't make anybody think back further than
January.
</P>
<P>
   Upset of the year: MP3.com (www.mp3.com)
</P>
<P>
   It's just amazing how one Web site can single-handedly turn the
music industry upside down. MP3.com's extensive collection of
downloadable digital music, combined with the music industry's
initial reluctance to release music for sale via the Web, created a
demand for digital music that can no longer be ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Most improved player: Slate (www.slate.com)
</P>
<P>
   After so much hype, so many misfires and a failed subscription
plan, Slate has finally found its way in the online world. Its
thoughtful political coverage and stable of experienced writers
have transformed Slate from Microsoft's and Editor Michael
Kinsley's goofy hobby to a Web site actually worth reading. Expect
sparks to fly as election 2000 shifts into high gear.
</P>
<P>
   Best use of a chat room: Atlanta office worker ``Hey Y'all''
</P>
<P>
   While hiding under her desk in an Atlanta office building, Leigh
Frey signed on to the CNN current events chat room using the
pseudonym ``Hey Y'all.'' She used the chat room to get the latest
news about gunman Mark O. Barton's shooting spree in the Piedmont
Center office complex where she worked. Other chatters were
skeptical but provided needed information and words of
encouragement. Proof that community on the Web isn't just about
geeky teen-age boys looking for love.
</P>
<P>
   Best search engine that just searches: (www.google.com)
</P>
<P>
   It's just one page with a box to type in your query. No free
e-mail, no online shopping, no chat rooms, no message boards.
There's nothing to do here but search the Web, and the results are
good. You click, you search, you read. Portals are like, you know,
so five minutes ago.
</P>
<P>
   Best place to try and make a quick buck: eBay (www.ebay.com)
</P>
<P>
   From human body parts to souvenirs of the World Trade
Organization riots in Seattle, eBay proves that Web auctions are an
endless source of fascination, a great source for obscure
collectibles and an outlet for every scam artist around. EBay
catches most of them, but not before the media have a field day.
</P>
<P>
   Best example that two heads really are better than one _ and get
more attention, too: MindSpring/EarthLink, EarthLink/MindSpring
merger
</P>
<P>
   I say tomato, you say tomahto; however you look at it, it's
still going to be the second-largest Internet service provider
after behemoth America Online. With 3 million subscribers and a
prototype deal with AT&AMP;T for open access to cable lines, the
MindSpring/EarthLink combo may have extended the potential lifespan
of the ISP well into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Best candidate for induction into the Silicon Valley Boys Club:
CMGI President David Wetherell
</P>
<P>
   When Lycos tried to merge with Barry Diller and Ticketmaster,
majority stockholder Wetherell was there to quash the deal. He then
snapped up failing search engine AltaVista and reinvented it as a
shopping and services site, and he's not done yet. The
Massachusetts businessman proves you don't need offices in Palo
Alto to play the Web game and win.
</P>
<P>
   Best argument for holiday shopping at the mall:
</P>
<P>
   e-toys.com, Toysrus.com, kbkids.com. (tie)
</P>
<P>
   Not even little Cindy-Lou Who could save millions of online
shoppers from frustration, disappointment, out-of-stock items and
poor customer service. Why toy retailers were unprepared for one of
their biggest seasons of the year is a mystery they need to solve
before December 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Best online example that war is hell: The first-person accounts
of the war in Kosovo from Belgrade radio station B92
(www.freeb92.net)
</P>
<P>
   Many called the war in Kosovo the first Internet war as millions
of Bosnians took to their laptops and described the NATO bombing of
Belgrade. Their stories were often-chilling accounts of life during
wartime that won't be easily forgotten.

Makings of a frugal funeral offered on Web &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   www.webcaskets.com _ We know, we know _ what kind of person
comparison-shops for a funeral? Well, according to this site, a
smart and frugal one. According to the site's frequently asked
questions, consumers routinely spend too much on funeral
arrangements. ``Be wary of funeral homes that do not have any
caskets priced below $2,000. This is a sure sign you are paying far
too much,'' webcaskets.com warns. Shop here to make quick shopping
out of an eternal resting place.
</P>
<P>
   MUST BUY: The Lone Star Art Casket, a casket emblazoned with a
picture of mesas, cacti, bluebonnets, the state flag and the Alamo,
$2,575 with shipping. Simply to die for. www.bn.com _ Most people
who buy books over the Internet have a preference: Amazon.com or
Barnes &AMP; Noble's Web site. But Barnes &AMP; Noble is upping the stakes
by offering one-day delivery in Manhattan, using courier and
hand-delivered services at no extra charge. While that doesn't mean
a whole lot right now, the experiment may spread to some of the
chain's 500 other locations, including Austin. So check out the
site now and start doing some comparison shopping in case that
happens.
</P>
<P>
   MUST BUY: ``Memoirs of a Geisha'' in softcover, $11.20 plus
shipping.

 By KATHLEEN B. EARLEY with JULIA LAWLOR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   My husband says I've always been a workaholic. When I was a kid,
I worked all the time. I got 50 cents allowance, and in high school
I got a raise to $1 a week. That was not enough to get your big toe
into a movie theater. So I used to baby-sit a lot. In high school,
I became known for cleaning houses. I was a parking lot attendant
at the University of California at Berkeley. I also worked in the
dean's office. One summer I was accepted into a program that sent
80 students to Washington. Ninety-five percent of the students
ended up as unpaid aides to members of Congress. I was one of three
who had paying jobs.
</P>
<P>
   I attended Berkeley in the '70s, but I was never part of the
counterculture. I was one of those students who went to all their
calculus and accounting classes. Patty Hearst lived a block away
from me when she was kidnapped by the SLA. I paid no attention. I
didn't care about politics. The summer I was in Washington, Nixon
was impeached, and everyone had to explain to me what was going on.
I was an early-stage nerd.
</P>
<P>
   I have a bachelor's degree in accounting and an MBA in finance
from Berkeley. I am a very logical person, and those are extremely
logical subjects. But by age 25, I knew there was a lot more to
life than becoming just a financial person. I wanted to really
apply my skills in an area where I could keep learning. Even back
then, I knew that computing was going to be the future.
</P>
<P>
   I basically stayed in sales for the first 10 years of my career
at IBM. They did a great job of training me on the basics of
management. The biggest reward of being a manager is not making
quota or making your business plan _ those are just the minimum
requirements to keep your job. The best reward is to watch people
achieve their full potential.
</P>
<P>
   I continue to struggle with finding a balance in my life. I'm
very lucky, because my husband, Francis Reed, works at home. We
never had a nanny for our children, Deirdre, who is 13, and John,
who is 10. Francis has always taken the primary responsibility.
Still, I have long days, and I miss them growing up. If I see the
children at all, it's only in the morning. That's the price you pay
if you want a robust career.
</P>
<P>
   My husband and I are a great team, but still a lot of things
don't get done. This is not the ``Leave It to Beaver'' house. You
would never walk in our house and say, ``Isn't this beautifully
clean.'' We have a German shepherd; there are dog hairs, but it's
home.
</P>
<P>
   If there's a secret to my success, it's growing up in a family
of five girls. I was the fourth. My father had us mowing lawns,
painting rooms, changing the oil in the car. He started a girls'
softball league in the '60s _ I was an all-star first baseman. We
were sent to an all-girls high school. I was 18 or 19 before
someone intimated that I wasn't supposed to be doing something
because I was a girl. I never had any limitations placed on me.

FTC MOVES AGAINST WEB-BASED PYRAMID SCHEMES &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Word to the con artists running illegal pyramid
schemes on the Internet: Halt.
</P>
<P>
   State and federal law enforcers Tuesday announced a crackdown on
scam operators who use new technologies to perpetrate old frauds.
The Federal Trade Commission said its staff, with the help of state
officials, has swept the Internet and found more than 600
potentially illegal pyramid sites.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcers have taken action against 23 sites so far, said
Paul Luehr, assistant director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer
Protection. The FTC has made patrolling the Web a high priority
because illegal scams ``have the potential to take off so rapidly,
given the global reach of the Internet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the crackdown, the FTC earlier this month filed a
federal lawsuit to shut down 2Xtreme Performance International
Inc., a Dallas-based company that purported to sell nutritional
supplements. The company was using the Internet to help recruit
distributors to ``learn a guaranteed method to put $5,000 to
$10,000 in your pocket in tax savings each and every year for the
rest of your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials say the company used deceptive claims to
recruit consumers, who spent as much as $1,300 each to participate
in the scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Luehr said many con artists are using e-mail to lure victims and
glitzy Web sites to help persuade them of a scheme's legitimacy.
``What we're finding is that many programs are operating on and off
the Web, using info-mercials, telemarketing, e-mail and Web sites''
to build the appearance of legitimacy, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC advises consumers to learn the difference between legal
multi-level marketing plans and shady pyramid schemes. The former
are a way to sell goods or services through distributors.
Typically, these plans provide distributors with commissions from
their own sales, as well as from the sales of the people they
recruit to become distributors.
</P>
<P>
   Pyramid schemes have a similar structure, but focus on the
commissions earned for recruiting new distributors, not on the
selling of useful products or services. Such plans are widely
outlawed because they collapse when no new distributors can be
found, and everyone except for a few people at the very top of the
pyramid loses his or her money.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC offers these tips to protect yourself from a illegal
pyramid schemes:
</P>
<P>
   _ Be wary of plans that claim you'll make money through the
growth of sales made by distributors you recruit, not from sales
you make yourself.
</P>
<P>
   _ Beware of plans that ask new distributors to spend money on
high-priced inventory.
</P>
<P>
   _ Avoid plans that promise enormous earnings or claim to sell
miracle products.
</P>
<P>
   _ Beware of shills _ ``decoy'' references who the promoter pays
to describe fictional success through the plan.

AT&AMP;T CHALLENGED OVER INTERNET CONTROL &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal regulators should act to give a wide range
of Internet service providers access to AT&AMP;T Corp.'s high-speed
cable networks, consumer advocates and academic experts said at a
forum Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Many Internet providers nationwide want access to AT&AMP;T's
``broadband'' network in order to sell blazingly fast service that
would allow Internet users to use video and other cutting-edge
applications. The Federal Communications Commission, citing the
emergence of competitive broadband technologies, has refused to
intervene.
</P>
<P>
   ``AT&AMP;T is in a position to decide what kind of applications run
on the Internet,'' Lawrence Lessig, a Harvard Law School professor
who specializes in computer issues, said at a forum on the future
on the Internet in the coming era of high-speed access.
</P>
<P>
   Lessig said the company seeks to undermine the open,
decentralized and competitive nature of the Internet, which fosters
innovation because anyone can use it and anyone can communicate
with anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   He said the central ``end-to-end'' design principle of the
Internet requires that the ``intelligence'' be located where users
put data onto the network and take it out _ at its ``ends'' _ and
that the ``pipes'' through which the information flows be as simple
and neutral as possible.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T, Lessig argued, wants to tie those pipelines to the content
and services they are selling and thereby control interconnection
to the world at large.
</P>
<P>
   ``Architecture matters,'' Lessig said.
</P>
<P>
   Lessig called upon FCC Chairman William Kennard to end his
hands-off policy.
</P>
<P>
   The independent agency, he said, should back local cable
regulators who are contesting AT&AMP;T policies in the courts in order
to ensure customers have a wide range of choices in the
fast-growing broadband market.
</P>
<P>
   The position taken by Lessig and consumer advocates at the forum
reflects the Clinton administration's policy, spelled out in a
57-page report Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers should have choice in both their content and their
Internet access provider,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T General Counsel James Cicconi rejected ``the faulty notion
that AT&AMP;T has a monopoly on cable modem access'' to the Internet.
He cited a Dec. 6 accord with Atlanta-based Mindspring Enterprises
Inc., a large Internet service provider, to offer high-speed access
over AT&AMP;T's cable lines after AT&AMP;T's current exclusive contract
with Excite(at)Home expires in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T Chairman Michael Armstrong has told Kennard that the
company has ``begun discussions with a number of (service providers
and Internet portals) about offering their services on our fixed
wireless and cable systems, and were open to discussions with
others as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Another seminar speaker, Mark Cooper, research director of the
Consumer Federation of America, said Armstrong would be
``conducting private negotiations'' in Aspen, Colo., over the
Christmas holidays with Steve Case, chairman of America OnLine
Inc., which has 20 million Internet subscribers in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not the right way to make public policy,'' Cooper
claimed. Jim McCann, an AT&AMP;T spokesman, declined to confirm that
such talks would take place.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In practice, the current debate revolves less over freely
displaying any and all content and more over such commercial issues
as which content will be featured and which data, if any, will get
preferred treatment through AT&AMP;T's fast ``pipes.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Cicconi cited legal and technical issues that he
said could oblige AT&AMP;T to act as more than a neutral mail carrier
in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is the company's obligation to preserve copyright
protection, a particularly sensitive issue in the music field at a
time when it has become simple for computers to make perfect
digital copies.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another unresolved issue: How to deal with ``bandwidth
hogs'' _ customers who, say, seek to download a movie at a time
when their neighbors are also on line, thereby slowing down their
speed of Internet access.

 &HT;    Funny thing: Comedians stand out no matter the genre
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The new movie on Andy Kaufman, ``Man on the Moon,'' reminds us
there are several different kinds of movies involving stand-up
comics. One is about stand-up; another stars a former stand-up in a
fictional setting; the third is a recorded stand-up act. Here are a
few examples:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Lenny'' (1974; R) _ Bob Fosse's biography of the late Lenny
Bruce puts something of a show-biz sugarcoating on the
controversial comedian's life and art, but Dustin Hoffman delivers
a stinging performance in the title role. Photographed in black and
white, which gives the film a kind of period grit, and surreally
structured with flashbacks, posthumous interviews, etc., the film
does manage to get across a good deal of the scabrous genius that
made Bruce a legend. Valerie Perrine, who plays his sex-kitten
stripper wife, Honey, brought a certain experience to the role;
previous to her movie career, she'd actually worked as a stripper
in Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Punchline'' (1988; R) _ Tom Hanks is a harried, driven
medical student and Sally Field is a harried, downtrodden
housewife. They meet in a class for stand-up comics where his style
is too hostile and hers is too wholesome. Each learns from the
other and, natch, they fall in love. The picture is saved from
terminal sitcom cutes by Hanks' dedication; he just won't let the
so-so material get the best of him. Social note: Six years later,
Field had ``aged'' from playing Hanks' love interest to playing his
mother in ``Forrest Gump.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Jerk'' (1979; R) _ Steve Martin made the switch from
comedy clubs to movie sets with this precursor to the ``Dumb and
Dumber'' genre of brain-dead comedy. Basically, it's the story of a
sucker (Martin) leaving home (the film's best gag: His parents are
black) to make it in the big city. One oddity: The original
director was to have been Mike Nichols, but Carl Reiner ended up
with the job.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Lady Sings the Blues'' (1972; R) _ Richard Pryor had made
maybe a half-dozen movies before critics applauded his daring
dramatic turn as Piano Man in this lush Diana Ross vehicle. The
singer-turned-actress plays the legendary Billie Holiday. Pryor's
role is essentially that of a victim-waiting-to-happen since he's
Holiday's main drug connection. Pryor loved the stretch into drama:
``Being a character, man, that makes me come alive. It's like being
in your conscious and your subconscious at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Richard Pryor Live on the Sunset Strip'' (1982; R) _
Possibly the most electrifying comedy concert ever recorded. The
title says it all: Pryor alive on the Sunset Strip. Praise the Lord
and smash the freebase pipe. Put together from two sold-out live
performances at the Hollywood Palladium, the film gives Pryor the
chance to transform himself into everything from a hungry cheetah
to Jim Brown. But the most harrowingly unforgettable bit is a
dialogue he has with his own pipe _ one of the most chillingly
accurate (yet hilarious) depictions of addiction you'll ever see.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Gilda Live'' (1980; R) _ Pure Gilda. Pure gold. Of the
original ``Saturday Night Life-ers,'' the guys had a lot easier
time breaking into movies than the women did. I guess Chevy Chase
just ``screamed'' romantic-comedy leading man while, well, what do
you do with a Gilda Radner? Gilda knew. She took her one-woman act
to Broadway, where it became a smash and Mike Nichols translated it
pretty much intact to film. A wonderfully funny 90 minutes and
without the Pryor rough-language factor.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Heartbeeps'' (1981; PG) _ Funny thing. You don't hear a word
about this in ``Man on the Moon.'' But yes, Andy Kaufman did make a
movie _ an embarrassing but somewhat sweet romantic comedy about
two robots (Kaufman and Bernadette Peters) who fall in love. What's
eerie about it is how absolutely conventional it is. You could rent
this one for the kids.

ROCKIN' FASHION IS ON A ROLL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   How far rock 'n' roll and fashion have come together.
</P>
<P>
   During the '50s, Elvis Presley just wore what he wore: Bright
jackets, black pants, carefully coiffed hair. A generation of young
men followed suit, turning Presley's flair for dressing (which he
had long before the serious money started rolling in) into a
statement of independence and love for this weird young thing
called rock 'n' roll.
</P>
<P>
   During the '90s, Nirvana was the catalyst for thousands of
youngsters abandoning their lite-metal poodle-do's and spandex (and
Poison CDs) in favor of long straight hair, torn jeans and flannel
shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has played a fashion show, designers from Bob Mackie to
Jean-Paul Gaultier to Thierry Mugler regularly do stage outfits for
popular acts, and Tommy Hilfiger has sponsored tours. VH1 has its
own fashion awards show that features clothes and live bands, and
what a Juvenile or a Jennifer Lopez wears in a new video will be
seen on the streets within days, if not hours.
</P>
<P>
   It's been, as the famously unfashionable Grateful Dead put it, a
long strange trip _ from Elvis' off-the-rack look to Elton John's
outrageous costumes to Kiss' cartoonish metal/Kabuki outfits to
Prince's purple finery to Kurt's sloppiness. And those benchmarks,
and many others, are on view at New York's Metropolitan Museum of
Art via the ``Rock Style'' exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   Running through March 19 at the museum's Costume Institute,
``Rock Style'' is a summation of ``how much rock styles have
influenced fashion,'' according to guest curator Myra Walker, who
has been an associate professor of fashion history at the
University of North Texas since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Walker went to New York to begin work on the exhibit at the
behest of Richard Martin, the Costume Institute curator.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew I could do it and was very passionate about the
subject and rock 'n' roll,'' she says. ``I told him for years I
wanted to work on it.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit is divided into five sections: Poets and Dreamers
(including Bruce Springsteen and Janis Joplin); Icons (Elvis, the
Beatles); Brilliant Disguise (David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust); Rebels
(punks, Goths, heavy-metal fans); and High Style (Elton John,
Cher).
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of outfits have been assembled from public and private
collections, as loaners from the musicians themselves, and from the
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, which helped organize the
exhibit. Among the performers whose clothes are featured are Elvis,
the Beatles, Elton John, Springsteen, Jimi Hendrix, Bono, Madonna
and Bjork.
</P>
<P>
   Walker grew up during the '60s and says that Joplin influenced
her style by putting together vintage and contemporary clothing, a
combination she says is coming back in vogue.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Rock Style,'' she says, is a true overview, and not
reflective of her style, except that ``my heart and soul and
passion is in it.''
</P>
<P>
   She also notes that the exhibit shows that at a certain point
rock and fashion became more important to each other; that ``line
of demarcation,'' she says, was Bowie, who carefully designed his
characters and their outfits, such as Ziggy Stardust, and took them
on tour.
</P>
<P>
   During the '80s, Madonna became a symbol to millions of teen-age
girls and young women, and she kept changing her wardrobe to fit
her music and her association with various designers. She, and
other stars of the MTV and post-MTV eras, have had a much more
immediate effect because of the proliferation of videos and music
on television 24 hours a day, something that was unthinkable before
MTV premiered.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this day and age people see imagery on their computer,
watching VH1, and on stations which cater exclusively to fashion,''
Walker says. ``There's definitely been a blurring of the lines.
Celebrities and pop singers go to some of the same designers and
you get a lot of exchange and see it on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   The show will journey to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and
Museum in May 2000 and will be on view there through Sept. 10.
After that, it will be at the Barbican Centre in London from Oct. 4
to Dec. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Walker will be the acting associate curator in charge of the
exhibit through December 2000, when she will return to Denton.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't a chronology of rock 'n' roll,'' she says.
``There's no possible way. But we've reached our major objective.
We've hit the high points.''

 By LAURA INGRAHAM  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Political predictions have gotten me into trouble before. Yes, I
was one of those pundits who thought President Clinton wouldn't
make it through the winter of 1998.
 &HT;    But if public humiliation wasn't enough to make our
commander-in-chief resign, it won't stop me from making some
predictions for the new political year, as we raise our glasses to
America's accomplishments in the 20th century.
 &HT;    Here are five political trends to look for in 2000. Reminder:
past performance is not necessarily an indicator of future
prediction success. 
 -0- 
 1. FORGET NEW HAMPSHIRE AND IOWA  
 &HT;    Right now the media is desperate for a horse race in the
Democratic and Republican fields, and No. 2s Bill Bradley and John
McCain have done their best to make the 2000 presidential elections
interesting.
 &HT;    Yet, even if George W. Bush and Al Gore are beaten in New
Hampshire or win by only narrow margins in Iowa, they will clinch
the nomination in the primary states that matter on Election Day,
states such as California and New York.
 &HT;    The latest Field Poll shows that, despite all the McCain and
Bradley hype, the numbers in California have barely moved in three
months. Bush leads McCain in California 47 to 12 percent, and Gore
leads Bradley 44 to 17 percent.
 &HT;    California has 54 electoral votes, Iowa and New Hampshire
combined have 11.
 &HT;    Pop quiz: Who won New Hampshire's Democratic primary in 1992?
 &HT;    Answer: Paul Tsongas. Like Pat Buchanan, who won the GOP primary
there in 1996, Tsongas went on to get trounced on Super Tuesday.
 &HT;    Lesson: New Hampshire and Iowa are fun, quirky political states
with blocks of independent voters, but their primary and caucus
outcomes aren't likely to throw the frontrunners off stride. 
 -0- 
 2. THE IMPEACHMENT FACTOR  
 &HT;    Remember all those dire predictions about the re-election
prospects of House impeachment managers?
 &HT;    As usual, conventional political wisdom will turn out to be
wrong. Even those congressmen in tough races _ Jim Rogan, for
example, who represents a California district that includes Burbank
_ will be sent back to Washington for another term.
 &HT;    Last week a USA Today poll showed that the public attitude
toward the impeachment proceedings has shifted sharply against the
president. A year ago, only 35 percent of the public approved of
the House decision to impeach President Clinton. Today, 50 percent
say it was the right thing to do.
 &HT;    The same polls show that fewer people agree that the president
should have been acquitted in the Senate.
 &HT;    So much for legacy-building. 
 -0- 
 3. RUDY AND HILLARY  
 &HT;    In New York, coverage of the early jousting between likely
senatorial candidates Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Hillary Clinton
invariably points to a ``bruising'' campaign, with political
observers predicting that tough-guy Rudy will go bare-knuckles
against the First Lady.
 &HT;    Reality check: It won't be Giuliani taking off the kid gloves.
For the past 25 years, Hillary has been helping manage Bill
Clinton's political war rooms, which turned negative campaigning
into an art form.
 &HT;    Who can forget Clinton's relentless Mediscare campaign against
Bob Dole in 1996? And Hillary's February 1998 ``vast right-wing
conspiracy'' attack on the ``Today'' show is rightly seen as the
single event which helped turn the Lewinsky scandal against the
prosecutors.
 &HT;    Rudy can run on his record. But what is Hillary going to run on?
That's easy _ how Giuliani's policies are ``anti-children,''
``anti-family'' and ``anti-women.'' 
 -0- 
 4. ORDER IN THE COURT!  
 &HT;    After the Vermont Supreme Court's recent ruling in favor of
same-sex marriages and a federal district judge's permanent
injunction against Cleveland's school-voucher program, court
appointments will become a rallying issue for conservative voters.
 &HT;    This could redound to Bush's benefit, as Republicans see years
of legislative work go up in flames at the hands of judicial
activists who overturn the will of the people by fiat and engage in
social engineering to overthrow traditional American values.
 &HT;    But watch the gay and feminist coalitions mobilize on this one,
howling ``Bush will take away your right to choose!''
 &HT;    To which Bush might respond, ``No, that's what a liberal judge
in Cleveland did to all those low-income parents who had chosen to
opt out of failing schools.'' 
 -0- 
 5. IT'S FOREIGN POLICY, STUPID!  
 &HT;    National-security issues will be a focal point of the general
election, as George W. Bush tries to regain the political edge
Republicans had in foreign policy in the 1980s.
 &HT;    If the economy continues to hum, he will have to campaign on the
growing national-security threats posed by China's aggressive
military buildup, Russia's precarious domestic situation and
nuke-happy North Korea.
 &HT;    Bush can shake the lingering concern about his ability to lead
if he can make a strong case that the new wave of anti-American
sentiment around the world is the fault of fuzzy, misdirected
foreign-policy efforts under eight years of Clinton/Gore. 
 -0- 
 EXPECT THE UNEXPECTED  
 &HT;    The new year will give us a new class of political winners and
losers, and a new series of challenges that cannot be met by
economic prosperity alone.
 &HT;    One prediction is safe, though: Election 2000 will once again
turn conventional political wisdom on its head _ so buckle up and
enjoy the ride.

 By LAURA INGRAHAM  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Political predictions have gotten me into trouble before. Yes, I
was one of those pundits who thought President Clinton wouldn't
make it through the winter of 1998.
 &HT;    But if public humiliation wasn't enough to make our
commander-in-chief resign, it won't stop me from making some
predictions for the new political year, as we raise our glasses to
America's accomplishments in the 20th century.
 &HT;    Here are five political trends to look for in 2000. Reminder:
past performance is not necessarily an indicator of future
prediction success. 
 -0- 
 1. FORGET NEW HAMPSHIRE AND IOWA  
 &HT;    Right now the media is desperate for a horse race in the
Democratic and Republican fields, and No. 2s Bill Bradley and John
McCain have done their best to make the 2000 presidential elections
interesting.
 &HT;    Yet, even if George W. Bush and Al Gore are beaten in New
Hampshire or win by only narrow margins in Iowa, they will clinch
the nomination in the primary states that matter on Election Day,
states such as California and New York.
 &HT;    The latest Field Poll shows that, despite all the McCain and
Bradley hype, the numbers in California have barely moved in three
months. Bush leads McCain in California 47 to 12 percent, and Gore
leads Bradley 44 to 17 percent.
 &HT;    California has 54 electoral votes, Iowa and New Hampshire
combined have 11.
 &HT;    Pop quiz: Who won New Hampshire's Democratic primary in 1992?
 &HT;    Answer: Paul Tsongas. Like Pat Buchanan, who won the GOP primary
there in 1996, Tsongas went on to get trounced on Super Tuesday.
 &HT;    Lesson: New Hampshire and Iowa are fun, quirky political states
with blocks of independent voters, but their primary and caucus
outcomes aren't likely to throw the frontrunners off stride. 
 -0- 
 2. THE IMPEACHMENT FACTOR  
 &HT;    Remember all those dire predictions about the re-election
prospects of House impeachment managers?
 &HT;    As usual, conventional political wisdom will turn out to be
wrong. Even those congressmen in tough races _ Jim Rogan, for
example, who represents a California district that includes Burbank
_ will be sent back to Washington for another term.
 &HT;    Last week a USA Today poll showed that the public attitude
toward the impeachment proceedings has shifted sharply against the
president. A year ago, only 35 percent of the public approved of
the House decision to impeach President Clinton. Today, 50 percent
say it was the right thing to do.
 &HT;    The same polls show that fewer people agree that the president
should have been acquitted in the Senate.
 &HT;    So much for legacy-building. 
 -0- 
 3. RUDY AND HILLARY  
 &HT;    In New York, coverage of the early jousting between likely
senatorial candidates Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Hillary Clinton
invariably points to a ``bruising'' campaign, with political
observers predicting that tough-guy Rudy will go bare-knuckles
against the First Lady.
 &HT;    Reality check: It won't be Giuliani taking off the kid gloves.
For the past 25 years, Hillary has been helping manage Bill
Clinton's political war rooms, which turned negative campaigning
into an art form.
 &HT;    Who can forget Clinton's relentless Mediscare campaign against
Bob Dole in 1996? And Hillary's February 1998 ``vast right-wing
conspiracy'' attack on the ``Today'' show is rightly seen as the
single event which helped turn the Lewinsky scandal against the
prosecutors.
 &HT;    Rudy can run on his record. But what is Hillary going to run on?
That's easy _ how Giuliani's policies are ``anti-children,''
``anti-family'' and ``anti-women.'' 
 -0- 
 4. ORDER IN THE COURT!  
 &HT;    After the Vermont Supreme Court's recent ruling in favor of
same-sex marriages and a federal district judge's permanent
injunction against Cleveland's school-voucher program, court
appointments will become a rallying issue for conservative voters.
 &HT;    This could redound to Bush's benefit, as Republicans see years
of legislative work go up in flames at the hands of judicial
activists who overturn the will of the people by fiat and engage in
social engineering to overthrow traditional American values.
 &HT;    But watch the gay and feminist coalitions mobilize on this one,
howling ``Bush will take away your right to choose!''
 &HT;    To which Bush might respond, ``No, that's what a liberal judge
in Cleveland did to all those low-income parents who had chosen to
opt out of failing schools.'' 
 -0- 
 5. IT'S FOREIGN POLICY, STUPID!  
 &HT;    National-security issues will be a focal point of the general
election, as George W. Bush tries to regain the political edge
Republicans had in foreign policy in the 1980s.
 &HT;    If the economy continues to hum, he will have to campaign on the
growing national-security threats posed by China's aggressive
military buildup, Russia's precarious domestic situation and
nuke-happy North Korea.
 &HT;    Bush can shake the lingering concern about his ability to lead
if he can make a strong case that the new wave of anti-American
sentiment around the world is the fault of fuzzy, misdirected
foreign-policy efforts under eight years of Clinton/Gore. 
 -0- 
 EXPECT THE UNEXPECTED  
 &HT;    The new year will give us a new class of political winners and
losers, and a new series of challenges that cannot be met by
economic prosperity alone.
 &HT;    One prediction is safe, though: Election 2000 will once again
turn conventional political wisdom on its head _ so buckle up and
enjoy the ride.

 &HT;    Bush tests new 'crash ad' strategy
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In a new campaign tactic aimed at connecting
with local voters, Gov. George W. Bush is airing TV commercials
targeted to run during newscasts the same day the ads are produced.
</P>
<P>
   The concept, called ``crash ads'' by Bush strategists, is being
tested in New Hampshire, a key early presidential primary state
where Bush has dropped to second in the polls and fielded criticism
for not engaging in enough hand-to-hand politicking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got a newsy feel,'' said Mark McKinnon, creator of Bush's
TV ad campaign. ``It's on tape, and it has the feel of real
immediacy. It communicates that he is there and working hard to
earn every vote.''
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon said he knows of no previous campaign that attempted to
get same-day ads on the air. Bush also has a set of more
traditional ads, filmed in advance and generally appropriate for
use in any state.
</P>
<P>
   The first crash ad was filmed Monday at a Bush campaign event at
a Manchester high school. The goal was to get it on the air during
Monday evening newscasts on the dominant local news station, but
McKinnon said it did not wind up airing until Tuesday morning
newscasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our objective is to try to get it as close to same day as
possible, within the constraints of the stations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-second ad shows Bush, during his Monday speech, talking
about leadership and his tax-cut plan. The ad ends with words on
the screen that say, ``To be continued.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, after building huge leads in early New Hampshire polls,
now trails U.S. Sen. John McCain of Arizona. McKinnon said the
crash ads are not a response to criticism of Bush's New Hampshire
campaign efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The ads, he said, will help tell New Hampshire voters ``that we
are there, that we are working hard, talking to real voters and
answering real questions on topics of concern to New Hampshire
voters.''
</P>
<P>
   The new Bush ad is running on the same Manchester station, WMUR,
that also is airing an anti-Bush ad paid for by little-known
presidential contender Andy Martin, a frequent unsuccessful
candidate for political office in Florida. Martin was jailed last
year for contempt of court after a verbal assault on a judge.
</P>
<P>
   The ad alleges that Bush has used cocaine in the past, a charge
to which Bush has declined to respond on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Bush had a cocaine problem. His brain suffered from
alcohol abuse. Don't trust Bush with your vote until he trusts you
with the truth about his past,'' Martin says on the ad.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign spokesman Ari Fleischer dismissed the ad as ``an
unfortunate part of the nonsense that sometimes comes with
political campaigns.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course they are lies,'' he said of the allegations on the
ad.
</P>
<P>
   WMUR spokeswoman Julie Campasano, who handles media inquiries
about the station's advertising policies, said the station had to
run the ad.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law is the law,'' she said. ``The Federal Communications
Commission says clearly, a legally qualified candidate can say
whatever they want to say in their message, and we as a station
have no authority, permission or right to censor or otherwise edit
any of the spots.''

FROM PICASSO'S DEMOISELLES TO MAPPLETHORPE'S MEN
</HEADLINE>
 ARTS-VISUALARTS-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ANDREW MARTON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDITOR'S NOTE: Till year's end, the Star-Telegram brings you a
subjective look at the top 10 moments of the century in the arts.
Today: Visual Arts &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1907: Pablo Picasso's ``Les Demoiselles d'Avignon'' debuts. It
heralds the arrival of a colossal artist who will stand astride
almost the entire century, introducing the world to myriad
movements, from cubism to collage art.
</P>
<P>
   1909: A 48-painting exhibition in Paris of Claude Monet's
``Water Lilies'' constitutes, to that date, the most successful
contemporary art exhibition in history, presaging future
blockbuster shows.
</P>
<P>
   1910: Sigmund Freud publishes an essay, ``The Childhood of
Leonardo da Vinci,'' in which he attempts a psychological
deconstruction of the painter's work. This essay ushers in heavy
psychological interpretation as a valid form of criticism in art
writing over the next 90 years.
</P>
<P>
   1913: At a drafty space in New York, the Armory Show (which
eventually travels to Boston and Chicago) gives eager Americans
their first look at European modern art, including the
impressionists, post-impressionists and cubists _ from Claude Monet
and Henri Matisse to Vincent van Gogh and Constantin Brancusi.
Viewers are shocked and critics outraged by Marcel Duchamp's ``Nude
Descending a Staircase.''
</P>
<P>
   1929: New York's Museum of Modern Art opens, becoming a capstone
to the previous openings of Washington, D.C.'s Phillips Gallery and
the Barnes Collection in Pennsylvania. MOMA's debut also spurs the
opening of the nearby Metropolitan Museum of Art's modern
collection. All of it signifies that museums finally consider
contemporary art worthy of its own exhibition space.
</P>
<P>
   1937: The ``Degenerative Art Show'' opens during the highly
vitriolic, bigoted days of Adolf Hitler's Third Reich. In this
dyspeptic exhibit that toured most of Germany, such classic German
artists as Max Ernst, and Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, along with
Picasso, Marc Chagall, Paul Klee and Wassily Kandinsky, were all
held up to ridicule for their sacrilegious style and subject
choices. The effect of this negative exhibition was to consolidate
support for modern art and make it synonymous with opposition to
Hitler's totalitarian nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   1952: In the publication ``Art News,'' an essay by the critic
Harold Rosenberg introduces the term ``action painting'' with
reference to the work of Jackson Pollock. Pollock's style becomes
the groundbreaking prototype of art in which painting is the record
of a physical act. Pollock would later take on cult status with his
other moniker, ``Jack the Dripper.''
</P>
<P>
   1964: American hybrid imagist Robert Rauschenberg shocks the
cognoscenti by winning the Venice Biennale. This garrulous ``bad
boy'' artist almost single-handedly legitimizes modern abstract
art.
</P>
<P>
   1978: The opening of the touring show ``The Treasures of
Tutankhamun'' at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art puts art on
the same plane as any sprawling mass-cultural event. The age of the
blockbuster art show dawns and will lead to unprecedented sums of
money spent at auction for such fashionable artists as van Gogh and
Monet. Collecting the new masters becomes the ultimate expression
of money well spent.
</P>
<P>
   1989: The controversy surrounding Robert Mapplethorpe's
photographs, some of which are deemed to be homoerotic,
single-handedly opens up the knotty debate about government funding
and art censorship. As the century draws to a close, the
Mapplethorpe dispute still focuses attention on what is ``good''
and ``bad'' art, and who should support it.

   Q: I am looking for clove stick candy. We used to have it around
Christmas time.
</P>
<P>
   _ Verna Zicafoose,
</P>
<P>
   Decatur
</P>
<P>
   And another sweet request: I am looking for a Peco Flake Pie.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bob Thomas, Roswell, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: Sweets for the sweet. We found these treats at the Market
Grocery Co. in the State Farmers Market, 16 Forest Parkway,
Building K. (404-361-8620). A 12-ounce box of Clove Stick Candy
(above), from the Piedmont Candy Co., is $1.59. A 6 1/2-round Peco
Pie (below) _ made of sugar, corn syrup, peanuts and coconut _ is
$1.19.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Stephenson is general manager of Market Grocery Co., which
sells primarily to wholesalers but also to the public. The store,
set in an industrial-type warehouse, is open 8 a.m-5 p.m.
Mondays-Saturdays. It stocks everything from canned goods, frozen
items and candy to cheese, meats and eggs. Most items are sold in
bulk, but you can buy individually. Stephenson accepts cash,
MasterCard, Visa and business checks but no personal checks.
</P>
<P>
   Directions: Take I-75 south to Exit 78 (Ga. 331 East/Forest

the entrance to the State Farmers Market. At the first stop sign,
take a right and drive until you reach Building K.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've been collecting Celestine Sibley's books, but I don't
have all of them. Do you know where they can be bought or ordered?
</P>
<P>
   _ Ann House, Rome, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: The Atlanta-Journal Constitution columnist's books have been
selling briskly since her death Aug. 15. Trying to track down
copies can be difficult. Four Sibley books are available in local
bookstores: 1964's ``Christmas in Georgia'' (Doubleday, $14.95);
1970's ``Mothers Are Always Special'' (Doubleday, $12.95); 1997's
``The Celestine Sibley Sampler'' (Peachtree Publishers, $19.95);
and 1997's ``Atlanta's Half Century With Furman Bisher and
Celestine Sibley (Longstreet, $20).
</P>
<P>
   The other books have proven a bit more elusive. But here are a
few sources that have copies of the hard-to-find titles. At Aspen
Books in Stone Mountain (404-296-5933), owner Paul Blicksilver says
he has a waiting list for Sibley books. But he adds, ``I have many
dealers across the country who send me books daily.'' The owner
stresses ``patience.'' At the Book Review in Marietta
(770-971-1103), owner Tom Brennan has a few titles. And A Cappella
Books on Euclid Avenue (404-681-5128) stocks some of the
hard-to-find titles. The Book Shop in Brunswick (912-262-6708) is
also a source. Or go online and try www.bibliofind.com or
www.amazon.com.

   Q: I am a huge Sinatra fan and have been looking for what seems
like forever for his Christmas record that he recorded with his
family in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   _ Martin Miller, Alpharetta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: The Sinatra clan, including Frank and kids Nancy, Frank Jr.
and Tina, first recorded ``The Sinatra Family Wish You a Merry
Christmas'' on vinyl in 1968. But it has been unavailable to fans
for more than 25 years. Now for the first time, daughter Tina,
through Artanis (Sinatra spelled backward) Group, has released a
24-karat gold CD from the original master tapes. It's $20.99 at
Tower Records-Video-Books, 3400 Around Lenox Drive N.E.
(404-264-1217). Hits include ``It's Such a Lovely Time of the
Year,'' (Nancy), ``Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town,'' (Tina), ``Some
Children See Him'' (Frank Jr.), ``The Christmas Waltz'' (Frank) and
``The 12 Days of Christmas'' (entire family).
</P>
<P>
   Q: My mother and best friend purchased waterless cookware about
30 years ago. They both have sets that need to be replaced. I
wonder if you have any idea where to find more.
</P>
<P>
   _ Connie Ware, Marietta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   And another cookware question: In the 1980s, I purchased a set
of stainless steel cookware from Townecraft, through in-home sales.
I want to replace a broken handle on one of the pans but have been
unable to locate the company.

<P>
   No matter where you go on the Internet these days, it seems you
won't get very far without first registering, signing in or
becoming a ``member,'' all of which require that you provide your
name, your e-mail address and other personal information.
</P>
<P>
   Many computer users shy away from registering at such sites out
of concerns about privacy and spamming. But others don't bother
simply because registering is a time-consuming pain in the neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish people wouldn't require log-ins for sites that don't
really need it,'' said Rhonda Hyslop of Washington, who spends
about an hour online each day.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two or three sites I've actually signed up for, but
unless they provide me with really good information, I'm not going
to bother,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Access to the further reaches of a site typically requires you
to register by picking a user name and a password, then entering
line after line of personal information, which can take several
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The quest for an unreserved user name is one example of how an
Internet site throws a wrench into what should be a quick and easy
task.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, if a desired user name is already taken, the site
will send the surfer back to a blank page to enter not just a new
user name but also every other piece of information relinquished on
the first go-round.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the time that the Internet was supposed to save you
by not having to run to the newsstand or to the library is being
lost by what you have to do to get into it,'' said Joseph Riser, a
marketing consultant in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``You end up registering for these sites that you might not ever
use again,'' he said, ``but getting beyond the first page is often
not worth the effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Peters, president of Vignette, an Internet consulting firm
in Austin, Texas, said: ``It often seems like Internet companies
are more interested in the data than in the person who's actually
coming to the site. You have to gain someone's trust before you
throw a form in their face. It's like trying to kiss on the first
date.''
</P>
<P>
   Approximately one in five people will register at a site to get
beyond the first few pages of information, according to a recent
survey of 10,000 Internet users conducted by Forrester Research of
Cambridge, Mass. The firm also recently published a study
predicting that electronic businesses would spend between $1.5
million and $2.1 million in 2000 to redesign sites, in part to
address usability issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is focusing on being first to market right now,''
said Nora King, vice president for interactive services at
Xcelerate, an electronic commerce consulting company in Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., ``but if companies can't master customer
profiling in a way that maintains credibility and integrity, they
won't stay in business.''
</P>
<P>
   Until then, one of the most effective solutions to registration
overload is Enonymous.com's Enonymous Advisor, a software program
that stores personal information on a person's computer and
automatically plugs it into the appropriate registration boxes upon
the user's request.
</P>
<P>
   The program, which is available free for downloading at
www.enonymous.com, is distinct from similar software in that it
rates the privacy policies of thousands of Web sites and reveals
the ratings to the surfer in pop-up windows whenever a new site is
visited. The person can then decide, based on the rating, whether
to register.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Mountain Arts, the electronic card company, is one of the
few popular sites that does not require registration. That is
because it believes the information that is handed over online is
not always valid, said Karen Davidson, vice president of marketing
and sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it's out of privacy concerns or not, we find that a
lot of people give out information that's only partially correct
anyway, so for now, we don't require it,'' Ms. Davidson said,
although Blue Mountain Arts may change its policy after
Excite(AT)Home completes its acquisition of the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's used in a good way, and not just turned over to an
advertiser, we don't have a problem with that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But for patient users, the benefits of taking the time to
register make the process worthwhile. ``I've never considered
registering any deterrent,'' said Roger Asbury of Fairbanks,
Alaska, who is registered at several news and community sites. ``It
gives me some semblance of confidence that someone can't post a
message using my name. Some of the places I visit don't have a lot
of members, so they really know me by the name I use, which lends
to the sense of community there.''
</P>
<P>
   News and community groups that users can customize are other
perks that make registration worth the effort, Asbury said.

Y2K GLITCHES LIKELY TO OCCUR JAN. 3 AND BEYOND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Assuming the United States makes it through New
Year's weekend with few Y2K-related computer glitches, it doesn't
necessarily mean Y2K will be a non-event.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, most Y2K problems likely won't reveal themselves until
Monday, Jan. 3 when millions of Americans return to work and
school. Some Y2K experts think such glitches will continue popping
up throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to test systems before the year 2000 and it's
another thing to test them on Saturday (Jan. 1) to see if they are
running,'' said John Koskinen, the White House's Y2K czar. ``The
real test will be on Monday when...millions of transactions and
events take place as they normally do.''
</P>
<P>
   Norm Dean, the executive director of the Washington, D.C.-based
non-profit Center for Y2K and Society, believes the ``majority of
events related to Y2K will occur Jan. 3 and beyond.''
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen said there's no way to predict when Y2K-related
problems might occur but did agree that many of them won't become
necessarily become apparent on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's highly unlikely anybody's lights or telephone are going
to go off immediately,'' Koskinen explained. He said it would
likely take a whole series of computer problems to build up before
it causes a large system to malfunction or shut down.
</P>
<P>
   While key systems in the United States like telecommunications
and electric power are expected to continue to function normally on
Jan. 1 and beyond, Koskinen said power failures could occur in
undeveloped countries beginning in early January.
</P>
<P>
   And the United States won't be immune to problems even though
the federal government and major private industries from airlines
to telecommunications have tested and re-tested their computers to
properly read the digits ``00''. If computers that contain
date-sensitive chips in them read ``00'' as the year 1900, they may
malfunction and potentially disrupt everything from air travel to
the systems that run the electric power supply.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Koskinen nor Dean predicts any large national or
regional Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we'll see planes fall out of the sky or
widespread power outages,'' Dean said. ``But there are going to be
problems in specific areas...that could affect a number of
people.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said most of the nation's one million non-profit
organizations have done nothing to address Y2K issues, which could
affect the services they provide to millions of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Potentially causing headaches for millions more Americans is the
fact that many small businesses have done to nothing to prepare for
Y2K. The National Federation of Independent Businesses reports that
1.5 million businesses are simply taking a wait-and-see approach to
see if cash register, security or refrigeration system fails when
they open their doors on Jan. 3 after being closed for the holiday
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem is that businesses may not be able to find
someone to fix their failed systems in time to keep them from going
bankrupt. Many small doctors' offices and hospitals haven't made
sure their billing systems will be able to request payments from
the federal government's Medicare and Medicaid systems and private
insurers _ problems that won't begin occurring until the end of
January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a computer break down in January may not affect a small
business or its employees until later in the year,'' Dean said,
explaining that employees likely won't lose their jobs on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   A failed small business could affect a larger firm it made
something used by the large company. Those problems likely won't
crop up until the end of January or later.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen said other Y2K problems might also surface later in
January or toward the end of the first quarter in March when the
first bills with 2000 dates on them are sent out. Last week some
water customers in West Des Moines, Iowa, for example, received
bills with a due date of Jan. 3, 1900.

<P>
   A few years ago, applying to college meant staring at blank
forms, fighting with the typewriter, applying liberal amounts of
white-out and _ after proofreading those precious pages for the
20th time _ packing them in 8-by-11-inch envelopes and sending them
through the U.S. Postal Service.
</P>
<P>
   This year, for more students than ever before, that ritual is
history. As deadlines loom this month, an increasing number of
college-bound students are sitting in front of computers, filling
in blanks on digital applications, crossing their fingers and
clicking the button that says Submit. Xap.com, a company that
develops online applications, reports that more than 100,000
applications have been processed through its computers in the last
two months. The University of California system, which created its
own Web forms, has drawn nearly 19,000 online applicants this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what students are expecting and demanding,'' said Chris
Munoz, associate provost for enrollment management at the
University of Dayton in Ohio, a college that received almost 50
percent of its applications via the Web last year. So far this
year, Munoz said, 68 percent of applications have arrived online.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of other colleges are offering Web-based applications,
too. About 77 percent of colleges now provide online applications,
according to a November survey of more than 400 admissions offices
by the National Association for College Admission Counseling.
Nearly three-quarters of those offices said their systems allowed
applications to be sent over the Web. Others can be downloaded and
then printed or saved to a disk, which can also be mailed to
admissions offices.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Angenend and Lauren Bogue, seniors at St. Agnes Academy
in Houston, raved about online applications. They said that in
addition to having avoided the trouble of finding a typewriter,
they had had the benefit of software that filled in rote
information _ name, address and Social Security number _ after they
had entered it once. ``It's so much more efficient,'' Ms. Angenend
said.
</P>
<P>
   That efficiency, which most students tout as the best part of
applying online, may be playing a role in a larger trend _ the
tendency of students to apply to more schools, especially if they
are aiming for selective institutions.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, many guidance counselors say, high school seniors
with good grades typically applied to four, five or six schools. In
recent years, the counselors have seen the same type of students
send applications to at least eight schools, if not 10.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in applications should primarily be attributed to
the intensely competitive college admissions process, many
admissions counselors and consultants say. Statistics from the
National Center for Education Statistics project that the number of
high school graduates next spring will be the largest since 1983,
and the percentage of students going to college _ 66 percent last
year _ is at record levels.
</P>
<P>
   Although some colleges are planning to respond to the influx by
admitting more students, most Ivy League colleges and other
selective institutions say they intend to maintain their class
sizes. That means more students competing for the same number of
slots. ``There is a frenzy,'' said Debbie Skelly, a guidance
counselor at St. Agnes.
</P>
<P>
   To compensate, students who hope to attend selective schools say
they are applying to more top-tier colleges and more backup schools
than they originally planned. In many cases, they credit the
technology with making it possible.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Angenend, for example, is applying to 11 schools. Three of
them _ Texas A&AMP;M University, Tulane University and the University
of Pennsylvania _ did not offer electronic versions of the honors
applications she wanted to submit, so she filled out the forms by
hand. Harvard University had no online option for submitting the
application, so she downloaded the application, which she plans to
fill out on a computer, print and send through the mail.
</P>
<P>
   But the Internet played a major role in Ms. Angenend's decision
to apply to the other schools, she said, including Boston College,
Bowdoin College in Maine, the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, Stanford University and Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had not considered applying to MIT before I realized that
they had an online application,'' Ms. Angenend said. Bowdoin,
Boston College and Rensselaer also became options only after she
found she could apply to them electronically. After painstakingly
filling in three paper applications and writing essays by hand
(like most of her peers, Ms. Angenend does not own a typewriter),
Ms. Angenend decided she was spending too much of her time trying
to cramp her handwriting into the forms' little lines. She said she
cringed at the thought of completing many more without the
assistance of software.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Walther, a senior at Lafayette High School in
Williamsburg, Va., also attributed several of his college choices
to the fact that the schools offered applications online. When he
first started looking at schools, he went to Web sites for the
University of Florida and Florida State, where he discovered he
could apply online. He did, finishing the applications (which
didn't require essays) in less than 20 minutes each. A few days
later, he said, he found that the University of Maryland at College
Park had an online application, too _ one that would enable him to
save his work and come back to it later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't planning to apply to College Park,'' Walther said.
``But I did it in just two afternoons.''  &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Application fees, of course, deter most students from submitting
dozens of forms online. Fees range from $15 to $65, and most Ivy
League colleges charge at least $50. But Bernice Munsey, an
educational counselor in Arlington, Va., said many parents are
starting to see those costs as minuscule compared with the price of
tuition and the importance of getting into a good school. ``The
most common parent comment I get,'' Ms. Munsey said, ``is, What's a
few more dollars for a few more applications?''
</P>
<P>
   Such comments make some admissions officers wonder whether a
combination of anxiety and technology may spur an influx of
applicants who are less than serious about attending. But in many
cases the swelling ranks of applicants are cause for cheer, they
say: After all, colleges like to brag about their selectivity. The
more applications they get, the more they can reject. And the
higher their selectivity, the better chance they have of landing a
coveted spot in annual college rankings, which use those
selectivity numbers in their ranking formulas.
</P>
<P>
   Many admissions officers say it is too early to tell whether
online applications will have any significant impact on college
selectivity. The number using technology is clearly increasing,
they say, but the majority of applicants still use paper. Some do
not have Internet-connected computers at home. Other high school
seniors are choosing to fill out some, if not all, of the forms on
paper _ even if they have the means to go online.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Chan, a senior at Clements High School in Sugar Land,
Texas, is an example. He is filling out some forms by hand and
printing others onto paper with the best quality he could find.
``I've paid attention to every detail,'' said Chan, whose first
choice is Brown University. ``I'm trying to stand out any way I
can.''
</P>
<P>
   But some schools _ like Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, Va. _ tell
students that they would actually prefer applications to be
completed over the Internet. A few, like the University of Dayton,
have even waived the application fee for those who use the Web.
Some graduate schools, like the Sloan School of Management at MIT,
will accept only applications sent online.
</P>
<P>
   Guidance counselors predict, too, that students may become more
inclined to take the technological route as the admissions season
comes to a close. Walther of Lafayette High School, for example,
envisions doing more online applications when January deadlines
have passed and nervousness kicks in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely see myself going through the Web and finding all
the ones that have February deadlines,'' Walther said. ``If I can
do it in an afternoon, why not have five more schools to get
into?''
</P>
<P>
   HOW-TO SITES
</P>
<P>
   The fastest way to find college application forms online is to
go to college Web sites. Nearly every college in the United States
has created an online admissions area by now, and many of them
include forms customized for their institutions. The most advanced
applications can be filled out and submitted over the Internet;
others are available online but must be downloaded to your computer
and then printed or saved to a disk.
</P>
<P>
   If you are a classic procrastinator and have not yet made your
college choices, you may want to browse lists of schools that offer
online applications. Several college-oriented companies are happy
to oblige. Many of them require you to set up an account first,
usually by providing at least your name, your e-mail address and a
password. Here are a few to get you started:
</P>
<P>
   APPLY: www.review.com
</P>
<P>
   Software created by the Princeton Review enables students to
download applications that automatically include basic information
they provided upon registering. The company has customized
applications for nearly 700 colleges.
</P>
<P>
   EAPPLY: www.collegequest.com
</P>

   When was the last time you got a bad haircut and were afraid to
leave the house without a hat or headband until it grew out? Two
competing beauty makeover programs are going
head-to-perfectly-coifed-head in hopes of helping you avoid being a
shut-in this season.
</P>
<P>
   In one corner stands the challenger, iStyle Personal Makeover by
Sierra Home, and in the other, the latest version of Broderbund's
Cosmopolitan Virtual Makeover Deluxe. Both programs let the user
load a photograph of herself from a scanner or a digital camera (or
use one of the many models' photographs included).
</P>
<P>
   Then the user digitally tries on a variety of hairstyles,
cosmetics and accessories in the search for a new look. Each
program will let you print out the resulting creations, and each
provides Web-shopping links and detailed product information.
</P>
<P>
   Although iStyle isn't stamped with a recognizable editorial
name, as its competitor is, it is still a robust program that is
packed with features. The software's libraries contain more than
500 hairstyles, 800 cosmetic colors and 400 accessories to sample,
including hats, jewelry and sunglasses.
</P>
<P>
   An interactive Beauty Consultant will give a survey to new users
to help provide appropriate suggestions for colors and styles. Once
the user has selected an electronic face to play with, new hair and
accessories can be added with a quick click.

<P>
   Makeup can be applied with a selection of on-screen brushes and
pencils, but getting used to putting on eye liner with a computer
mouse may take practice. Cosmetics from companies including Revlon,
Almay and Philosophy are represented in the program's makeup bag.
</P>
<P>
   iStyle also contains 24 short videos that show the user how to
accomplish such feats as properly applying lipstick and blush, as
well as maintaining one's eyebrows. There is a Tips section that
contemplates issues like ``Liquid Vs. Powder Foundation,'' and
short video clips advise the user on how to recreate specific looks
from distinctive periods in fashion like the 1960s and 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The program is currently available with a $10 rebate through
January, and updated styles and products will be offered for
downloading at its Web site at www.istylemakeover.com.
</P>
<P>
   Cosmopolitan's Virtual Makeover Deluxe, now in its second
edition, also provides the user with 500 hairstyles, including some
with bridal veils. The program has 30 hair solutions for men as
well, along with several mustache and beard options.
</P>
<P>
   The program offers 300 cosmetic colors (Cover Girl products are
featured prominently) and 200 accessories like hats and sunglasses
to sample. Users are prompted to participate in a short beauty quiz
early on to help create a personal profile, and recommendations are
offered throughout the program based on the profile.
</P>
<P>
   Virtual Makeover retains much of the sassy flavor of
Cosmopolitan's editorial voice (an example from the beauty quiz:
``What Look Do You Like Best: Sleek Sophisticate or Daringly and
Devastatingly Sexy?''), and users can also print out their
made-over images on Cosmopolitan covers. New styles can be
downloaded from the product's Web site (www.virtualmakeover.com).
</P>
<P>
   The Web site also has details about various versions of the
Virtual Makeover software offered at different prices. And
Broderbund offers a version called Essence Virtual Makeover aimed
at African-American women.
</P>
<P>
   Whichever personal makeover product you choose, you should keep
in mind that what you see on your screen may not be the true color
of the cosmetic products in real life. Factors like background
lighting, the quality of the personal image you use and even the
type and color calibration of your computer's monitor may affect
the look.
</P>
<P>
   To run iStyle, users will need a computer running Windows 95 or
98, with a minimum 133-megahertz Pentium-class processor, 16
megabytes of RAM and 45 megabytes of free hard drive space. Virtual
Makeover 2 Deluxe requires a computer running Windows 95 or later,
with at least a 90-MHz Pentium-class processor, 16 megabytes of RAM
and 40 megabytes of free hard drive space.
</P>
<P>
   (Although there are no Macintosh versions of the programs, they
should both run adequately on Power Macs using Windows-emulation
software like Virtual PC.)
</P>
<P>
   Both programs have their strong points and support from
established beauty-product companies. While Virtual Makeover has
the strength and reputation of Cosmopolitan magazine behind it,
iStyle seems better suited for the novice cosmetics user. But in
the end, the decision may depend on one factor: brand loyalty.

   Q. I often get attachments with an ``.exe'' file extension sent
to me by e-mail, and I can never get them to open. Is this a
problem with my Macintosh, or does this type of file get easily
corrupted?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The files you have been receiving are in a format that does
not work on the Macintosh operating system. The .exe extension you
see at the end of the file name stands for executable file, and it
is commonly found on Windows and DOS systems. The program icons for
Windows applications represent executable files.
</P>
<P>
   An executable file that is small enough to be sent by e-mail can
be anything from a bit of desktop animation to a small, compact
program. While the code these files are written in does not
generally work on the Macintosh, it is possible to view the the
files if you have software that lets you emulate Windows, or a
hardware PC card installed.
</P>
<P>
   While executable files can be helpful or fun to distribute among
friends, they are also a choice place for rogue programmers to hide
computer viruses. Computer users on any platform should be
extremely careful when downloading and opening file attachments,
and it is important to keep your antivirus software up to date.

TAXES, TRADE RISE AS DANGEROUS ISSUES FOR DEMOCRATS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Dec. 26)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Al Gore and Bill Bradley will continue into the new
year sparring over their opposing education and health care
initiatives, each trying to convince voters that his proposals
would be best serve the American people.
</P>
<P>
   But while they are jockeying for position on those issues, two
other concerns _ taxes and trade _ pose real dangers to the
candidates as they race toward the Iowa caucuses, the New Hampshire
primary and the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The tax assault will be launched against Democrats by the
Republicans, and the trade dispute will be fought within the
Democratic Party itself.
</P>
<P>
   No matter which presidential hopeful wins the Republican
presidential nomination, he will be armed with a tax reduction plan
as a major campaign weapon. It may be George W. Bush's excessively
large cut in taxes ($483 billion over five years), John McCain's
more modest reduction or one of the flat-tax plans advanced by
Steve Forbes or Gary Bauer.
</P>
<P>
   Whichever plan is offered by whichever candidate, it will force
the Democratic nominee to go on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bradley argue that the budget surplus, which remains
something of a novelty after decades of red ink, should be used to
support better education and expanded health care along with
protection of the environment.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Gore has asserted that Bradley would have to raise
taxes to pay for his proposed health reforms and Bradley has denied
it. But Gore himself has promised to balance the budget each year
he is in the White House, a goal almost impossible to achieve if
taxes are cut massively or if the nation suffers a deep recession
that decreases tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, in the first election of the 21st century, the two parties
will be facing off over an issue that has divided them in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, who traditionally oppose big government and federal
solutions to problems, argue for reduced taxation and the return of
revenues to those who paid them: the taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, on the other hand, would use the surplus to shore up
programs that they consider vital to the rearing of children, the
well-being of the poor and the elderly and the conservation and
protection of natural resources. In the fall, Bill Clinton vetoed a
tax cut approved by the Republican-controlled Congress that would
have slashed revenues by nearly $800 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The second issue is far more baffling because free trade is a
policy favored by presidential candidates in both parties, since
Patrick Buchanan finalized his divorce from the GOP. But the issue
is far more divisive for Democrats than for Republicans, who before
World War II proudly proclaimed their belief in high protective
tariffs.
</P>
<P>
   Echoes from the chaos that greeted the World Trade Organization
on the streets of Seattle earlier this month continue to
reverberate through the Democratic Party and weaken its historical
alliance with organized labor and environmentalists. Delegates,
American government officials and Seattle residents will not soon
forget the putrid stench of tear gas that permeated the atmosphere
between Lake Washington and Puget Sound.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that anarchists turned a peaceful demonstration into
violence. But that was not difficult to accomplish with thousands
of protesters gathered to object to the WTO's closed-door meetings.
The dissidents contended that delegates at those meetings supported
the exploitation of natural resources and of children and poor
people toiling in depressing working conditions for little pay.
</P>
<P>
   Free trade is actually a tremendous boon to the economies of the
United States and its trading partners. Instead of limiting
commerce through stringent high protective tariffs, which
protectionists advocate, free trade makes it possible for America
to sell its products everywhere in the world because foreign
countries can sell their wares here.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle uprising, however, made it clear that reforms are
required to win the trust of the people and to provide greater
equity between trading partners and the workers who make the
products that are sold.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who hosted the Seattle session, was accused of caving
in to unionists and environmentalists when he told delegates that
the people who were demonstrating in the streets should be
represented at the bargaining table.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in the Washington Post, former Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger said that ``instead of assuming the mantle of President
Truman's leadership role in inspiring the structure of the
post-World War II world, Clinton decided to play to the gallery.''
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger added that ``Clinton could have used the occasion to
put forward a farsighted program for dealing with what portends to
be one of the gravest challenges of the new century: the huge gap
between the sophistication of the dominant economic model called
globalization and traditional political thinking still based on the
nation-state.''
</P>
<P>
   It is true that Clinton sounded like a typical Democratic ward
healer when he recommended that the demonstrators' protests be
heard at the conference table.
</P>
<P>
   But, in doing so, he may have provided working men and women
some hope that reforms can be achieved.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats cannot back away from free trade without committing
flagrant hypocrisy. They were identified with the issue in the 19th
century and every one of their 20th century presidents, from
Woodrow Wilson to Clinton, has been a free trader. So, oddly
enough, has every Republican president since Dwight D. Eisenhower.

   The custom of putting out cookies for Santa is sugary sweet in
theory, but has anyone ever explained how to make homemade cookies
practical?
</P>
<P>
   Here's an idea: You make the batter, then let the kids make the
cookies while you fiddle with another task. So what if some are
lopsided or a bit burned? They'll have fun.

   MIDEAST-TALKS (Ramallah, West Bank) _ Despite speculation that
the resumption of Israeli-Syrian talks would derail the Palestinian
peace track, significant progress appeared to have been made by
early Wednesday morning in an intimate meeting here between Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. It was
the first time that an Israeli prime minister had ventured into a
Palestinian-ruled city for a peace meeting, which in itself broke a
barrier in the relationship. And the setting was very casual: Barak
and Arafat met in the elegant home of the Palestinian leader's
second-in-command. By Deborah Sontag.

   SRILANKA-ELECT (Colombo, Sri Lanka) _ Gulping back tears, a
white bandage on her right eye from a bomb attack four days ago,
Sri Lanka's president claimed Wednesday a divine mandate to pursue
and defeat the rebels who had tried to kill her. ``These are the
wounds of sheer naked and unadulterated hatred of man for man,''
she said, her voice quavering. She called for peace, but she also
vowed ``the strongest possible action'' against the ethnic Tamil
separatists if they persisted in their 16-year insurgency. It was
victory day for President Chandrika Kumaratunga, who won a second
term in office with what, by Sri Lankan standards, was tiny
electoral majority of 51.2 percent. By Seth Mydans.

   NEWYEAR-SITTERS (Undated) _ On New Year's Eve, many of the
1,000-some couples attending the Memphis Junior League's charity
ball at the Peabody Hotel will bring their children along. So the
parents can be free to cavort, they have coralled 40 of the Annie's
Nannies agency's adult baby sitters. They will pay the sitters $330
each, or $33 an hour for the 11-hour affair and triple the agency's
usual rate. So it will be in most big cities and their affluent
suburbs this New Year's Eve. Teen-age baby sitters stand to earn
$200 or $300 for one night's work and adults up to $400, or more
than the tab for many a partygoer's duck and champagne. By Peter T.

was had by all. By John Noble Wilford.

<P>
   In a darkened theater in Edinburgh, Scotland, an audience
watches a tall, gaunt man in an oversize top hat videotape himself
on stage, then train the camera on his spectators, and finally
project all the footage on screen _ all the while issuing slightly
offbeat pearls of wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stephen Hawking is often mistaken for an idiot,'' the
performer says in a clipped British accent. ``People with physical
disabilities are often mistaken for having mental ones as well. In
a similar way, athletes are often asked their opinions.''
</P>
<P>
   The people in the audience laugh, some of them nervously. The
comic remains stoic, stares into the lens. and says, ```How
self-indulgent is this?' he asks the audience as he films himself
with a camera uttering nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   He cuts to the audience for a reaction shot. Then an image of an
exclamation point is superimposed over the video for emphasis. Then
back to our host. ``If you've never read a book in your life,'' he
says, waiting a beat, ``I suggest you keep your mouth shut.''
</P>
<P>
   The performance is punctuated by live synthesized music and
one-liners sung in operatic style by a woman in a Viking hat. Every
so often, for no apparent reason, a backstage camera picks up an
actor in a rubber monkey headmask blinking quizzically into the
lens.
</P>
<P>
   This is the surreal, hypnotic, digital world of Simon Munnery,
32, a London-based comic and computer expert. It's a theatrical
experience that creates live television on stage, while poking fun
at our obsession with it.
</P>
<P>
   The show, aptly titled ``The League Against Tedium,'' was a
success this past year at the Melbourne Comedy Festival, London's
West End and the Edinburgh Arts Festival. After another eight-week
West End run at London's New Ambassador Theater beginning Jan. 28,
the show's next stop may be New York (the details are still being
negotiated).
</P>
<P>
   What makes Munnery's show so inventive is how he integrates
technology into his comedy. Behind the simple stage set is an
orchestra of wires and laptops, which he conducts through software
he has written for this project. The effort is a result of his
dozen years knocking about the London comedy scene and two decades
of computer tinkering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Comedians speak through a mike,'' he said in an interview.
``So why not a camera? Just as a mike amplifies a voice, a camera
amplifies a face. It's simply another medium to express the
comedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Complementing the backstage camera are two additional ones
mounted on a wooden sword that Munnery holds during the
performance. The sword is furnished with six buttons linked via
radio remote control to a backstage laptop with a 250-megahertz
processor and 64 megabytes of RAM. The computer links to a
projector that flashes the finished ``show'' on the screen _ a
standard rear projection screen or sometimes just a sheet _ which
the audience watches alongside Munnery's performance. The comic
switches from camera footage to digital effect _ essentially
creating a rough cut of that evening's performance as it happens.
</P>
<P>
   Munnery's perpetually percolating imagination constantly
reinvents the show. In the months since the Edinburgh run, Munnery
has added a ``mouthcam,'' a small camera mounted on a bicycle
helmet that reaches in front of his face and enables extreme
close-ups of his lips and teeth. He has also programmed a computer
keyboard to call up images and sounds, rather than letters and
numbers, which he wears around his neck like a guitar.
</P>
<P>
   For all the skill required to master both the show's comedic
timing and technogadgetry, Munnery takes an earthy, unpretentious
approach to his art. A shy, thoughtful manner counters his manic
stage persona. He creates television but rarely watches it. He
writes software but does not have his own Web site. Rather than
hold auditions, he simply cast his friends. And when it comes to
advancing his vision, he relies more on instinct than calculation.
``I don't know where I'm heading,'' he says. ``But I know I'm on
the right path.''

&HT;        TEXAS TRADE ROUTES ARE UNDER FUNDED, GRAMM SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Alex Canizares  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Dec. 22 - Texas Sen. Phil Gramm says increased trade
across the Texas-Mexico border has put a strain on the area's
infrastructure, and he is pushing the Federal Highway
Administration to spend money on repairing highways and roads used
for international trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the North American Free Trade Agreement has been an
unmitigated success, communities along the Southwest border and
those along the trade routes in Texas have been unfairly burdened
with massive increases in resulting traffic and congestion,'' the
GOP senator said in a letter to Transportation Secretary Rodney
Slater last week.
</P>
<P>
   The administration will decide early next year how to allocate
about $140 million in congressional money set aside to improve
border highways and trade-critical routes around the nation. Gramm
authored the five-year $700 million program, which began last year.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Texas received $14 million - only 10 percent of this
year's $140 million given out nationwide. These levels pleased
Texas Transportation Commissioner David Laney, who called it a
``significant boost'' in May.
</P>
<P>
   But Gramm feels $14 million is not enough, and said the
administration is ``shortchanging'' the border with insufficient
funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the burden that Texas is put on by NAFTA, 10
percent is not on par,'' said Gramm spokeswoman Kathy Dempsey on
Wednesday. ``There are not enough roads, and a lot of those roads
need improvement.'' The Texas Department of Transportation has
asked the federal administration for $126 million next year out of
that $140 million.
</P>
<P>
   According to Gramm, truck traffic in Texas has grown 19 percent
in three years as of May 1998, much of it due to higher trade with
Mexico. By 2012, traffic volume could nearly double on Interstate
10 and on U.S 59, Gramm said. That route will form the basis for
the proposed new highway, Interstate 69, Gramm said last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Dept. of Transportation is requesting money for next
year for 28 border and trade-related projects. Among the more
expensive projects the department would use the money for are: a
$75.8 million plan to upgrade two city and county roads in the West
Laredo trade corridor; $39.6 million to be used to widen the U.S.
83 freeway in Hidalgo County from four to six lanes; $29 million to
widen the U.S. 77/83 freeway in Harlingen through San Benito from
four to six lanes.
</P>
<P>
   If the projects are not funded or are only partially funded,
Texas transportation officials might look elsewhere for money, such
as federal loans under the State Infrastructure Bank, said Mark
Cross, spokesman for the Texas Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   The border's highways struggle to compete for state funds,
because other projects in the state with heavier traffic take
priority, Cross said.

CLICK AND HEAT, THAWING OPTIONAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ind., Calif.)   (Circuits)  
 (af)  
 By MICHELLE SLATALLA 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I never met an artichoke I didn't like. Of course, that could be
because I never tasted an artichoke _ or an avocado or even
hollandaise sauce _ until I was in college.
</P>
<P>
   I had a lot of pent-up demand, after growing up in a house where
the recipes tended more toward ``weenie stew,'' the specialty of a
family member who wishes to remain nameless (I'll call her Mom). To
make weenie stew, slice a package of franks into a pot of canned
whole tomatoes. Add some canned corn (stop reading here if you feel
queasy), then bring to a boil.
</P>
<P>
   For my introduction to other cuisines, I thank my friend Mary
O'Doherty, widely considered one of the best cooks ever to coax
heat from the cranky electric stoves that plagued the off-campus
apartments in Bloomington, Ind., in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Mary must also live with the knowledge that the powerful craving
for delicious foods she unleashed led me as a penniless freshman to
shoplift guacamole (marked at an outrageous $2.54).
</P>
<P>
   I still crave three Mary O'Doherty-worthy meals a day. However,
the constraints of my current life style _ imagine the phone
ringing and the dog throwing up on the dining room rug as three
little girls of varying heights clutch at my legs and, in
synchronized whines, blame me for the invention of long division _
often eliminate the leisurely hours I would otherwise devote to
cooking.
</P>
<P>
   So I was excited recently to learn that on the Internet I could
buy meals _ or substantial entrees that needed only a loaf of
crusty bread to attain the status of supper _ over the Internet.
The meals would arrive on my doorstep, ready to be stored in the
refrigerator or freezer until minutes before eating.
</P>
<P>
   It all sounded appetizing, but specialty food may be one area
where the Internet and my expectations are hopelessly ill-matched.
The current proof that online shopping works is that whatever you
ordered arrives relatively on time and with a minimum of calls to
the shipping department. But as any gourmand knows, the proof of
the pudding (not that I ordered pudding) is in the taste.
</P>
<P>
   With New Year's Eve coming up, I decided to hunt for appetizers.
Over two weeks, I ordered from four online retailers _
www.tamale.com, www.customcreationfoods.com, www.cookexpress.com
and www.koshermeal.com.
</P>
<P>
   All items arrived when promised, within 48 hours, packaged
securely inside Styrofoam containers and cooled by either dry ice
or little freezer pillows. With great excitement, I took an
inventory of my loot: black bean soup, squash flan and root
vegetable medleys.
</P>
<P>
   But for someone who once turned to crime for a $2.54 container
of dip, the shipping costs were expensive, adding a hefty surcharge
that ranged from $12.95 at CookExpress to a whopping $27 for each
order at Koshermeal.com.
</P>
<P>
   When I phoned Stefan Strehler, co-owner of Custom Creation
Foods, to complain, he said the problem was one of perception, by
which he meant my perception. ``You pay to get ANY food
delivered,'' Strehler said. ``A 9-inch pizza that comes to the door
costs you $15, and then you tip the driver $2, and you have paid
$17 for a pizza that cost the company $1 to make.''
</P>
<P>
   All four companies met my convenience test: the food could be
served within 30 minutes. Three companies shipped frozen foods that
tasted fine after being defrosted in the microwave and heated. (I
ignored the recommendations to thaw at room temperature. If I had
that much foresight, I wouldn't need to go on the Internet in
search of cheese blintzes.)
</P>
<P>
   And the fourth, CookExpress, sent the raw or partially prepared
fresh ingredients for a chicken dinner and enclosed instructions on
how to finish the meal.
</P>
<P>
   My only regret as I handled the plump, juicy pieces of chicken
was the recipe. Dutifully, I coated the pieces in oil, salt and
pepper, then roasted for 30 minutes on a cookie sheet. The result:
bland. Couldn't the company have included a sprig of rosemary, a
clove of garlic or even the hint that a cast-iron skillet would
produce a browner skin?
</P>
<P>
   Many of these foods would not have passed the O'Doherty taste
test. I did not enjoy the kosher meals, for example: the salmon
entree was not as fresh as I would have liked, and the rib-eye
steak was tough. But for the target customer _ a business traveler,
for example _ the concerns might be different.
</P>
<P>
   ``We offer large portions, it's wholesome, and the food gets
there and is waiting in the hotel,'' said Bill Pinkerson, owner of
Royal Palate Foods in Inglewood, Calif., which runs Koshermeal.com.
</P>
<P>
   The best foods came from Custom Creation Foods, where items were
partially cooked, highly seasoned and then frozen quickly before
being mailed. The technique was successful when it came to the tuna
cakes, flavored with ginger and lemongrass. The soups were a little
salty, but let me point out that the saltiness has not stopped me
from having several portions, including a piping hot cup of the
shrimp and corn soup that I am eating right now as I type.
</P>
<P>
   The jalapeno and cheese ``nibblers'' ($6.46 for a 2-pound bag
containing 30 to 34 appetizers) were certainly good enough to serve
at a New Year's Eve party. So were the tamales from Pedro's Tamales
in Texas. And in the context of party food, the tamales' biggest
drawback _ their near-microscopic size _ could be a plus. In fact,
I could eat a dozen. At $59.95 for six dozen (including shipping),
they could add up.
</P>
<P>
   But not for me. On New Year's Eve, I'll honor my food roots. No,
not the weenie stew. I'll be dipping artichoke leaves into
hollandaise sauce.

SITES THAT MEASURE CANDIDATES' VIEWS AGAINST YOUR OWN 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Candidates seeking a presidential nomination are already
campaigning heavily, and voters are trying to determine, by viewing
debates and political advertisements, whom they support. This
political season, they have an alternative online.
</P>
<P>
   You can register your opinions on various issues, hit a button
and see which candidate's views match yours.
</P>
<P>
   Curt Anderson of Ashland, Ore., who set up a candidate selector
at www.selectsmart.com, said he took on the task to ``cut through
negative ads and the hyperbole of presidential Web sites.'' Since
his candidate selector went online in September, up to 30,000
individuals have visited the site each day.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, a marketing director for Darex, an industrial tools
manufacturer, built his first online selector in 1996 to help
clients choose industrial tools. Then, on his own, he created a
selector on the Web for dog breeds that he licenses to an online
pet supply company.
</P>
<P>
   For the candidate selector, Anderson scoured news reports to
collect candidates' positions on issues like free trade and
campaign finance reform. He said he tried to keep the language of
the questions neutral, and although some users have accused him of
left-wing or right-wing biases, many have been satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were still in the classroom,'' wrote a visitor to the
site's message board, ``I definitely would have my students access
this page.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the prevailing topics of discussion on the site's
bulletin board is whether a vote for a third-party candidate would
be a wasted vote; many users have been surprised to find that they
have selected third-party candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The more extreme position a user states, the more likely the
selector is to choose a third-party candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``His test is structured so that they kick you to extremes,''
said Michael Cornfield, a research professor at George Washington
University who studies online politics. ``If you choose one of the
stronger positions, it weights it three times as much.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's system does not hide its methods. The site discloses
the scoring system and the methodology by which candidates are
selected. Experts in political uses of the Internet say that
disclosure is a critical component of candidate selectors online.
They warn that if the concept catches on, it could be manipulated
by campaigns and interest groups to favor specific candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen deLaski, director of political and government
programming for America Online, helped develop a selector for AOL
called President Match. Developed with CBS News, President Match is
expected to be completed in January, but a test version at
www.presidentmatch.com is available to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. deLaski and Cornfield recommended that voters watch for
several factors to identify credible selectors online: neutral
wording of the questions, a listing of all the candidates, full
disclosure of the group or individual behind the selector, a
privacy policy and an explanation of the computation process.
</P>
<P>
   With those considerations in mind, Ms. deLaski said she hoped
that President Match would enhance the way voters make decisions.
Selectors, she said, help a voter ``to step away from your
preconceived notions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It stacks the candidates up on your a la carte issue
positions,'' she added. ``We're not recommending that people use
this as their only tool for voting, but it might help people cut
through the sound bites.''
</P>
<P>
   Harry Browne, who was the Libertarian Party's candidate for
president in 1996 and is seeking the nomination for 2000, learned
about the SelectSmart site from a steady stream of e-mail from
voters who discovered his campaign through the site.
</P>
<P>
   But when Browne took the test himself, he found that he came up
with only an 83 percent match to his actual views. So Browne,
submitted position statements to the site, as did three other
candidates. It was worth his time, he said, because the site is
spreading awareness of the Libertarian Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were people who were ideological strangers, who said, `I
didn't know anything about the Libertarian Party,''' Browne said.
With this sort of selection method, he added, ``I would think that
over time, we would get a lot of new people. The Internet is very,
very good for us.''

`ONE DAY'S PERFECT WEATHER': TALES WITH A PREVIOUS LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes at end of review.)

 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps more intellectually stimulating than emotionally
satisfying, the seven stories in Daniel Stern's new collection,
``One Day's Perfect Weather: More Twice Told Tales,'' are
nevertheless engaging and entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a funny situation arises in ``A Man of Sorrows and
Acquainted With Grief,'' which the author notes as inspired by
``The Passion According to St. John,'' by Johann Sebastian Bach.
Kraft, a New Yorker exiled in Texas, where he conducts a small-town
high school orchestra, gets so worked up over this Bach music on
his rental-car stereo that he finds himself driving 90 mph.
</P>
<P>
   When he tries to explain this to the trooper who flags him for
speeding, the man asks him if the words are ``some kind of
Jewish.'' Kraft tries to translate, throwing in ``He was despised
and rejected, a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief,'' which
of course is actually from ``The Messiah.''
</P>
<P>
   The trooper asks Kraft to step out of his car, embraces him,
saying ``You're my brother _ my brother in Jesus,'' and demands
that he come with him to the local precinct to describe to his
friends how he was ``blinded by the light.'' The resulting
complications mix up Kraft's existence entirely.
</P>
<P>
   And instantly intriguing is ``Duet for Past and Future,''
inspired by Robert Frost's poem ``The Road Not Taken,'' about a
lawyer who goes to a concert in Indianapolis and thinks he
recognizes the cello he once played professionally and ended up
selling to pay his way through law school.
</P>
<P>
   What Stern is up to here is the same thing he did in his
previous two books, ``Twice Told Tales'' and ``Twice Upon a Time,''
which was, as he writes in his introduction to the present volume,
to take ``a text by a writer of the past whom I loved'' and make it
``basic to a fiction; as basic as a love affair, a trauma, a house,
a mother, a landscape, a lover, a job or a sexual passion.''
</P>
<P>
   He continues, ``I believe that, with or without knowing it,
regardless of the level of our education or our reading, all of us
carry within us, in more or less complex degree, the basic thrust
of Kafka, Melville, Frost, Freud and all the other great authors
who have become the very intellectual and spiritual air we
breathe.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Stern credits Nathaniel Hawthorne and Jorge Luis Borges
as his inspiration for such bridge building, as he calls it, he
might have added that some of the best-known works of the 20th
century, like Joyce's ``Ulysses,'' Eliot's ``Waste Land'' and
Pound's ``Cantos,'' were similarly inspired. Their creators, too,
like Stern, felt the weight of past literature pressing down on
them.
</P>
<P>
   The way Stern's technique works in these stories is really in
three different ways. A given work inspires the subject of each
story, as, for instance, Frost's poem ``The Oven Bird'' prompts
``The Taste of Pennies,'' about a man, Lee Binstock, who has had to
give up playing the clarinet because he has been punched in the
mouth during a traffic altercation.
</P>
<P>
   The story then weaves into its plot the work that inspired it:
Binstock gets a note recommending ``The Oven Bird'': ``You should
read it _ we should all read it.'' It comes from a man about to
commit suicide. When Binstock reads the poem and learns what
Frost's bird is saying with his song _ ``The question that he
frames in all but words/Is what to make of a diminished thing'' _
he takes it to be a message inviting him to kill himself, too.
</P>
<P>
   Finally the story reflects in various ways the meaning of the
work that inspired it. At the end of ``The Oven Bird,'' Binstock
realizes that what the poem is really saying is that you have to
make the most of your diminished state. Binstock and his wife
decide to celebrate their lives by making love and eating a big
breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   In other stories Stern plays wittily with the inspiring work's
meaning. ``Duet for Past and Present'' allows its protagonist to
rediscover in effect the road he failed to take long ago when ``two
roads diverged in a yellow wood.'' In ``Questions and Answers,''
inspired by Yeats' visionary poem, ``The Second Coming,'' a student
cheats on a test in which the poem is the subject and than seduces
her teacher to prevent him from reporting her. After the student
leaves, the telephone rings _ we don't know why _ in the apartment
where the teacher is sleeping, and the story ends with the teacher
counting the rings. Is it the ``rough beast'' of Yeats' poem
slouching toward Bethlehem to be born?
</P>
<P>
   In the strongest piece of all, ``A Philosopher's Honeymoon,''
inspired by Wallace Stevens' poem ``The Man on the Dump,'' the
meaning of the story merges with the meaning of its inspiration.
Abrams, ``a rabbi on the run,'' wakes up from a drinking binge and
finds himself on ``the dump just outside the town's limits,''
Abrams himself ``just barely inside his own limits: of drink, of
loss, hope, fatigue.'' As a Sunday morning sermon to three other
derelicts at the dump he reads a poem, ``The Man on the Dump,''
from a book he has unsuccessfully tried out on his temple's women's
reading circle, ``The Palm at the End of the Mind: Poems by Wallace
Stevens.''
</P>
<P>
   Puzzling out its meaning as the expression of ``a poet tired of
used things, fed up with living on the dump of old, received
images,'' he breathes out the last line of the poem: ``Where was it
one first heard of the truth? The the.'' He wishes he had pencil
and paper so that he could write ``a story based on a poem as he'd
wanted to do for months, maybe years.'' It would end with ``the
passionate stuttering search for the moment'' one ``first heard of
the truth, the stuttering search for the the, the the, the the the
the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the weight of past literature may reduce the rabbi to
stuttering, Stern uses it as a practicer of jujitsu might. He
absorbs the force of ``old, received images'' and spins them into
his own truths fluently and without ever falling down.

Y2K ALERT EXTENDS TO JAN. 3 AND BEYOND 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Editing changes throughout)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The world-wide Y2K alert doesn't end on New Year's
Day.
</P>
<P>
   Specialists in preventing Y2K computer glitches say that most
Y2K problems probably won't reveal themselves until Monday, Jan. 3,
when millions of Americans return to work and school. Some experts
think Y2K computer glitches could pop up throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real test will be on Monday...when millions of
transactions and events take place as they normally do,'' said John
Koskinen, the White House's Y2K czar.
</P>
<P>
   Even though government and private-industry computers have been
tested to make sure they can properly read the digits ``00'' as the
year 2000, the true test will come Monday, Jan. 3, when computer
systems are used in normal operations rather than in a test-mode,
according to Koskinen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's highly unlikely anybody's lights or telephone are going
to go off immediately,'' Koskinen said. It would likely take a
whole series of computer problems to build up before a Y2K computer
collapse causes a large system to malfunction or shut down, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Norm Dean, the executive director of the Washington, D.C.-based
non-profit Center for Y2K and Society, agrees that Jan. 1 isn't the
crucial date. The ``majority of events related to Y2K will occur
Jan. 3 and beyond,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   While key U.S. systems like telecommunications and electric
power are expected to continue to function normally on Jan. 1 and
beyond, Koskinen said power failures could occur in undeveloped
countries beginning in early January.
</P>
<P>
   And the United States won't be immune to problems even though
the federal government and major private industries from airlines
to telecommunications have tested and re-tested their computers to
properly read the digits ``00.''
</P>
<P>
   If computers that contain date-sensitive chips read ``00'' as
the year 1900, they may malfunction and potentially disrupt larger
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Koskinen nor Dean predicts any large national or
regional Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we'll see planes fall out of the sky or
widespread power outages,'' Dean said. ``But there are going to be
problems in specific areas...that could affect a number of
people.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said most of the nation's one million non-profit
organizations have done nothing to address Y2K issues, which could
affect the services they provide to millions of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Another potential problem stems from the fact that many small
businesses have done nothing to prepare for Y2K. The National
Federation of Independent Businesses reports that 1.5 million small
companies are simply taking a wait-and-see approach to see if cash
registers, or security or refrigeration systems fail when they open
their doors on Jan. 3 after being closed for the holiday weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem is that businesses may not be able to find
someone to fix their failed systems on a timely basis.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
reports that many doctors' offices and hospitals haven't tested
their billing systems to make sure they will be able to request
payments from the federal government's Medicare and Medicaid
systems and private insurers _ problems that won't begin occurring
until the end of January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a computer break down in January may not affect a small
business or its employees until later in the year,'' Dean said,
explaining that employees likely won't lose their jobs on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   A failed small business could affect a larger firm if the
smaller firm were a key supplier to the larger company. Those
problems likely won't crop up until the end of January or later.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen said other Y2K problems might also surface later in
January or toward the end of the first quarter in March when the
first bills with 2000 dates on them are sent out. For example, some
water customers in West Des Moines, Iowa, last week received bills
with a due date of Jan. 3, 1900.

 &HT;    (Vincent de Liberto is a freelance writer based in New York.)
 &HT;    
 By VINCENT de LIBERTO  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Nearly 40 years ago I passed my first Christmas in Germany as a
19-year-old American soldier. I had arrived at a small U.S. Army
base outside the town of Herzogenaurach, so deep in the snowbound
month of December that I lacked an immediate duty assignment.
Luckily, I received a surprise 24-hour-pass to Christmas Eve.
 &HT;    I joined some other green-uniformed soldiers and we boarded the
regular military bus heading off base to explore the nearest big
city--Nuremberg.
 &HT;    We had seen a USO brochure describing Nuremberg as Germany's No.
l Christmas city. Nuremberg of the infamous war-crimes trials, the
Hitler rallies, the racial laws--Nuremberg, the setting of the Nazi
propaganda film, ``Triumph of the Will.''
 &HT;    Our bus stopped at the very Nuremberg streetcorner I would
recognize years later in the film, ``Judgment at Nuremberg.''
 &HT;    I paired up with an army pal and we headed for the Altstadt, or
Old City, the walled medieval center surmounted by a castle on a
hill.
 &HT;    First, of course, we made sure to stop in one, two, or
three--and probably four--Stammlokals (or taverns) along the way;
we needed to test the local Franconian brews.
 &HT;    I knew something of Nuremberg's notorious history under the
Nazis -- I had seen the 1930s newsreels of torchlit Nazi rallies in
the Altstadt. Allied bombers later flattened the half-timbered
medieval center. In 1945, in a single night, 600 bombers rained
down tons of explosives, killed thousands and rendered tens of
thousands homeless.
 &HT;    We finally made our way into the Altstadt, behind the restored
medieval walls, and found the Hauptmarkt, or central market square.
 &HT;    For hundreds of years, each Christmas season the market square
has hosted the Christkindelsmarkt, or Christchild Market.
Nurembergers set up dozens of booths and stalls--festooned with
strings of lights--and sell regional handicrafts, dolls, puppets
and tin soldiers.
 &HT;    We caught a smokey whiff of a foodstand offering Nuremberger
specialties--warm pretzels and sizzling sausages. Immediately, we
reached for the Nuremberger pretzels that go so well with the
Franconian brews, then the small, dark, sizzling bratwursts, served
up with steamy scoops of onions on a hard roll. And there was
Schnapps, of course.
 &HT;    Suitably fortified against the biting night air, we moved
through the market throngs to the Shoenerbrunner, or Beautiful
Fountain, a medieval masterwork. We found the fabled brass ring
hand-wrought seamlessly into the iron grillwork, spun it, but could
not work it loose. We greeted sparkling frauleins in the spirit of
the season as they passed us by.
 &HT;    By now, it had surprised me to see no signs of war damage. In
Frankfurt, our embarkation point into West Germany, lingering
damage was still evident in bombed-out ruins in side streets. Now,
in Nuremberg, in the heart of the most heavily bombed city in West
Germany, singled out for special attention as a Nazi symbol of
rancor and exterminationist hatred of the Jews, the Altstadt
seemingly had risen to a new life to celebrate the birthday of
Christ.
 &HT;    As commercial activity began to slow in the Christkindelsmarkt,
the crowds were moving toward the Frauenkirche, or Our Lady's
Church. It too had risen from the ashes of destruction -- postcards
on sale in local shops showed it as a smoldering ruin in 1945. Now,
the doors were flung open to a Christmas service under way.
 &HT;    A celestial melody floated out into the market square,
accompanied by angelic voices. It was ``Silent Night,'' but it took
me a moment to catch on to the original German lyrics, ``Stille
Nacht, Heilige Nacht.'' They floated in the night air like a balm
to soothe my private images of World War II destruction.
 &HT;    In 1960 the German language was mainly familiar to me through
the filter of World War II movies--''Achtung!'', ``Jawohl!'' or
``Heil Hitler!'' Now I heard it renedered beautifully in a
Christmas night, breaking the spell--stilling the rallies,
silencing the bombings--and I went on in later years to memorize
the German lyrics, preferring them to the English.
 &HT;    In fact, I started to collect them in the languages of countries
where I would pass the holidays in the ensuing decades--France,
Spain, the Netherlands.
 &HT;    I recently managed to revisit Herzogenaurach and Nuremberg,
through the magical transports of the Internet and the World Wide
Web. I glimpsed this year's Christkindelsmarkt by ``live cam'' and
I tilted it toward the Frauenkirche. The cyberspace visitation
sparked the lost chord of my 1960 foot-soldier's tour of Nuremberg.
Suddenly, I could recall the deathless tones of ``Stille Nacht,
Heilige Nacht'' as it soared to the heavens above that frigid
cobble-stoned market square, once filled with venomous fury and
firebombs.
 &HT;    Later, I focused my Web search engine on ``Silent Night.'' To my
surprise, the master site was not in Germany or Austria but in
South Africa. The Web page (http://silentnight.web.za/) collects a
hundred translations of Silent Night in a hundred languages,
literally from A to Z--including versions in American Sign Language
and Delaware Indian.
 &HT;    Then again, maybe it is fitting that we should find ``Silent
Night's'' healing words featured in South Africa--a country that
has also known more than its fair share of rancor and racial hatred
in this century. So as the 1999 Christmas season draws into the
year 2000, the Afrikaner sings ``Stille nag, heilige nag'' -- and
the Zulu, --''Busuku obuhle.''
 &HT;    The Christmas carol that conquered the world.

 HOME IMPROVEMENT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
  By BERNARD GLADSTONE 
 Includes illustration. 
 Copyright 2000 Bernard Gladstone 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I often use boards of miscellaneous widths for my projects
because I buy hardwood that is not standard in dimension.
</P>
<P>
   When I want to saw such a board in half lengthwise I am often
dealing with an odd or awkward fraction that is very hard to divide
exactly _ if I want both halves to be exactly the same width.
</P>
<P>
   An old-timer once told me that there is an easy way to do this
with an ordinary ruler, but I forgot how. Can you help?
</P>
<P>
   A: Use a ruler that is several inches longer than the width of
the board and place it diagonally across the edges of the board as
shown in the illustration.
</P>
<P>
   Position the ruler so that one of the inch marks is exactly on
one edge of the board, and then swing the ruler so that another of
the inch marks is at the opposite edge.
</P>
<P>
   Then make a line or mark on the board that is precisely
alongside the half way mark on the ruler (half way between the
numbers on the ruler that are lined up with the edges of the
board).
</P>
<P>
   This will accurately indicate the center of the board.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We are planning to install some room air conditioners in our
upstairs corner bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Does it make any difference whether we install them on the side
of the house that faces toward the north or the south?
</P>
<P>
   A: When there is a choice, installing an air conditioning unit
on the side of the house where it will get the least amount of sun
is generally more efficient _ at least if the unit will be run
during daylight hours (at night it will make little difference).
</P>
<P>
   However, you can accomplish the same thing if you will put up
some kind of awning to shade the outside of the unit, or if there
is a large tree nearby to shade it from the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I want to replace the aluminum wire mesh in my old screens
because there are numerous tears and holes in the mesh.
</P>
<P>
   I was told it is easier to replace this screening with
fiberglass or plastic mesh, but I notice that the old screen wire
is held in place with a plastic strip that is pressed into a
channel along the edge of the frame.
</P>
<P>
   How do I get this out so that I can install the new fiberglass
screening in the same way?
</P>
<P>
   A: The plastic strip or spline that holds the mesh in place is
simply pressed into the channel on top of the wire.
</P>
<P>
   To remove it you simply pry it out with a screwdriver or knife.
Don't worry about tearing or breaking it _ you can buy new spline
by the foot at hardware stores and home centers.
</P>
<P>
   After this has been removed, strip off the old screening then
replace it with the new mesh.
</P>
<P>
   To install the new mesh use one of the special rollers that are
sold for this purpose. Use it to press the new spline into the
channel on top of the mesh.
</P>
<P>
   Cut each piece of mesh a couple of inches oversize (in length
and width) to permit pulling it tight before you push the spline
down into the channel on top of the mesh.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some of the dry-wall nails in our house have started to come
out in a few places.
</P>
<P>
   Can you tell us why this is happening and what we can do to
repair this damage?
</P>
<P>
   A: When nails work loose on gypsum board it is usually because
either the wrong kind of nails were originally used or because the
beams or studs have warped as the house settled.
</P>
<P>
   To repair the damage drive a dry-wall nail or screw in a couple
of inches above or below the ``popped'' nail and set its head
slightly below the surface without tearing the paper facing.
</P>
<P>
   The old nails can then be either pulled out or driven all the
way in, after which both nail holes can be covered with joint
cement.
</P>
<P>

propaganda film, ``Triumph of the Will.''
 &HT;    Our bus stopped at the very Nuremberg streetcorner I would
recognize years later in the film, ``Judgment at Nuremberg.''
 &HT;    I paired up with an army pal and we headed for the Altstadt, or
Old City, the walled medieval center surmounted by a castle on a
hill.
 &HT;    First, of course, we made sure to stop in one, two, or
three--and probably four--Stammlokals (or taverns) along the way;
we needed to test the local Franconian brews.
 &HT;    I knew something of Nuremberg's notorious history under the
Nazis -- I had seen the 1930s newsreels of torchlit Nazi rallies in
the Altstadt. Allied bombers later flattened the half-timbered
medieval center. In 1945, in a single night, 600 bombers rained
down tons of explosives, killed thousands and rendered tens of
thousands homeless.
 &HT;    We finally made our way into the Altstadt, behind the restored
medieval walls, and found the Hauptmarkt, or central market square.
 &HT;    For hundreds of years, each Christmas season the market square
has hosted the Christkindelsmarkt, or Christchild Market.
Nurembergers set up dozens of booths and stalls--festooned with
strings of lights--and sell regional handicrafts, dolls, puppets
and tin soldiers.
 &HT;    We caught a smokey whiff of a foodstand offering Nuremberger
specialties--warm pretzels and sizzling sausages. Immediately, we
reached for the Nuremberger pretzels that go so well with the
Franconian brews, then the small, dark, sizzling bratwursts, served
up with steamy scoops of onions on a hard roll. And there was
Schnapps, of course.
 &HT;    Suitably fortified against the biting night air, we moved
through the market throngs to the Shoenerbrunner, or Beautiful
Fountain, a medieval masterwork. We found the fabled brass ring
hand-wrought seamlessly into the iron grillwork, spun it, but could
not work it loose. We greeted sparkling frauleins in the spirit of
the season as they passed us by.
 &HT;    By now, it had surprised me to see no signs of war damage. In
Frankfurt, our embarkation point into West Germany, lingering
damage was still evident in bombed-out ruins in side streets. Now,
in Nuremberg, in the heart of the most heavily bombed city in West
Germany, singled out for special attention as a Nazi symbol of
rancor and exterminationist hatred of the Jews, the Altstadt
seemingly had risen to a new life to celebrate the birthday of
Christ.
 &HT;    As commercial activity began to slow in the Christkindelsmarkt,
the crowds were moving toward the Frauenkirche, or Our Lady's
Church. It too had risen from the ashes of destruction -- postcards
on sale in local shops showed it as a smoldering ruin in 1945. Now,
the doors were flung open to a Christmas service under way.
 &HT;    A celestial melody floated out into the market square,
accompanied by angelic voices. It was ``Silent Night,'' but it took
me a moment to catch on to the original German lyrics, ``Stille
Nacht, Heilige Nacht.'' They floated in the night air like a balm
to soothe my private images of World War II destruction.
 &HT;    In 1960 the German language was mainly familiar to me through
the filter of World War II movies--''Achtung!'', ``Jawohl!'' or
``Heil Hitler!'' Now I heard it renedered beautifully in a
Christmas night, breaking the spell--stilling the rallies,
silencing the bombings--and I went on in later years to memorize
the German lyrics, preferring them to the English.
 &HT;    In fact, I started to collect them in the languages of countries
where I would pass the holidays in the ensuing decades--France,
Spain, the Netherlands.
 &HT;    I recently managed to revisit Herzogenaurach and Nuremberg,
through the magical transports of the Internet and the World Wide
Web. I glimpsed this year's Christkindelsmarkt by ``live cam'' and
I tilted it toward the Frauenkirche. The cyberspace visitation
sparked the lost chord of my 1960 foot-soldier's tour of Nuremberg.
Suddenly, I could recall the deathless tones of ``Stille Nacht,
Heilige Nacht'' as it soared to the heavens above that frigid
cobble-stoned market square, once filled with venomous fury and
firebombs.
 &HT;    Later, I focused my Web search engine on ``Silent Night.'' To my
surprise, the master site was not in Germany or Austria but in
South Africa. The Web page (http://silentnight.web.za/) collects a
hundred translations of Silent Night in a hundred languages,
literally from A to Z--including versions in American Sign Language
and Delaware Indian.
 &HT;    Then again, maybe it is fitting that we should find ``Silent
Night's'' healing words featured in South Africa--a country that
has also known more than its fair share of rancor and racial hatred
in this century. So as the 1999 Christmas season draws into the
year 2000, the Afrikaner sings ``Stille nag, heilige nag'' -- and
the Zulu, --''Busuku obuhle.''
 &HT;    The Christmas carol that conquered the world.

STUDY FINDS REJECTED AIDS DRUG EFFECTIVE ON SOME PATIENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ULYSSES TORASSA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A University of California at San Francisco
study shows that an AIDS drug that was dropped three weeks ago
because of harsh side effects is effective for some patients who
have become resistant to other treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Adefovir, manufactured by Gilead Sciences of Foster City, was
the first drug to get a cold shoulder from AIDS activists, who
complained that the side effects were too great.
</P>
<P>
   That helped persuade a Food and Drug Administration advisory
panel last month to recommend against approving it, leading the
company to drop further efforts to get it to market.
</P>
<P>
   But a study led by UC-San Francisco researcher James Kahn, done
in part at San Francisco General Hospital, found that the medicine
was helpful to a group of patients whose other drug therapies were
not doing a good job keeping in check the amount of HIV, or human
immunodeficiency virus, circulating in their bloodstream.
</P>
<P>
   The research studied the effects on 442 patients at 33 medical
centers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Adefovir, an anti-retroviral drug known as a nucleotide analog,
cut the amount of virus detected by 60 percent, making it only a
modest performer among other drugs used to trip the virus that
causes the acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Among patients who had already become resistant to other
nucleotide analogs, the average response was a 70 percent drop in
the virus.
</P>
<P>
   But Kahn said what surprised researchers was how long-lasting
the effects were. Patients were still getting results nearly a year
after beginning the therapy, well past the time when many other
drugs begin to lose their effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It clearly has anti-viral activity that is durable and
sustainable, with pretty easy adherence,'' Kahn said. He said he
was disappointed that the FDA advisory panel had chosen not to
recommend it for approval.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Getty, an AIDS activist in San Francisco, said many people
thought that the anti-viral properties of the drug were relatively
weak when weighed against its harsh effects on the kidneys, which
began to malfunction in many patients. The study found that those
effects were reversible when the therapy was stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Gilead has another drug, tenofovir, which shows
much greater promise, Getty said.
</P>
<P>
   There were fears that people taking adefovir might then become
resistant to tenofovir, which is similar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need more drugs that barely work and that are very
toxic,'' Getty said. ``We have enough of those already.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Getty said he did not oppose the FDA approval of
adefovir, even though some AIDS activists did. When it came to
hearings, Getty said there was a ``deafening silence'' from AIDS
groups, never before seen when an anti-HIV drug was being
considered for approval.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 3, Gilead announced it would no longer pursue adefovir
as an AIDS therapy and instead put efforts into drugs such as
tenofovir, which is currently being tested on patients.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it would continue to pursue approval of
adefovir as a treatment for hepatitis B, at much lower doses than
were used to treat HIV patients.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS is an affliction in which the human immunodeficiency virus
weakens the immune system, subjecting the body to serious
infection. AIDS is most often spread through sexual contact,
sharing contaminated needles and infected blood products.

MOVIES AND GAMES: SO ALIKE, SO DIFFERENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 (bl)  
 By J.C. HERZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Years ago, when society at large became aware of product
placements in films, we invented a game called ``Spot the product
placement,'' wherein the audience would try to deduce contractual
arrangements between Hollywood and Corporate America. Of course,
there were some obvious hints outside the theater. Fast-food and
packaged good promotions were dead giveaways. But in the end, every
product on screen was suspect. It changed the nature of the
moviegoing experience in a subtle but irrevocable way.
</P>
<P>
   Video games do the same thing. In thousands of darkened theaters
screening ``Toy Story 2,'' for instance, there are two kinds of
people in the audience: the ones who play video games and the ones
who don't. And they see different things on the screen. For
nongamers, ``Toy Story 2'' is about a kidnapped cowboy doll, his
fellow toys' rescue attempt and the importance of friendship, with
some clever cultural references and jokes thrown in.
</P>
<P>
   For gamers, ``Toy Story 2'' is a preview of what they can do at
home on their PCs, Playstations and Nintendo 64s. It's a tasting
menu of environments to explore in greater depth with a keyboard or
a joypad. There is no question in their minds that this movie is
going to be a video game, and that the film itself was informed by
interactive media. The light on their faces is cinema. But what
they see is the skeleton of a game, and that changes the nature of
the moviegoing experience.
</P>
<P>
   If you've spent any time with a Playstation, the first scene of
``Toy Story 2'' is instantly recognizable as a video game scenario:
Buzz Lightyear jumps across a series of illuminated discs suspended
over a chasm. On the other side is a battery-shaped icon, obviously
a power-up. The whole setup is a well-established characteristic of
3-D platform adventure games, to the point of being a cliche.
</P>
<P>
   So when Buzz dies at the hands of Zurg, the archetypal big boss
at the end of a level, the joystick jockeys in the audience know
it's a game.
</P>
<P>
   The camera pulls back to reveal Rex the Dinosaur complaining
that it's too difficult to hit the controller buttons with his tiny
plastic arms. Any gamer can sympathize, and can also look forward
to succeeding where Rex failed.
</P>
<P>
   Playing ``Toy Story 2: The Videogame'' shows you how much cinema
and interactive media are mingling these days _ and the ways that
they remain distinct.
</P>
<P>
   On a superficial level, they are closer together than ever. Fast
processors and graphic accelerator cards bring the PC version
within spitting distance of the movie's silky, computer-generated
smoothness. Computers haven't gotten fast enough to import 3-D
models directly from the film, but some of the original motion data
is used to make the video game characters walk with the same gait
as their big-screen counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of tweaking, back and forth, regarding the 3-D
animation,'' said Dan Winters, a senior producer at Disney
Interactive, the maker of the game (Disney owns Pixar, which
produced the film). ``But I think there'll be more and more truly
shared assets in the future. There will be a day when we can take
the character of Buzz Lightyear or Woody from Pixar and use them
directly in our video game systems.''
</P>
<P>
   But even as the graphics merge, the film and the game are
structurally distinct. Film is a linear form (flashbacks and
Tarantino-esque shuffling don't alter the narrative trajectory;
they just change the order in which events are revealed). Movies
are about storytelling.
</P>
<P>
   Video games, on the other hand, are a nonlinear medium. They
have almost nothing to do with storytelling and everything to do
with movement and geography. When you're playing a video game,
storytelling is the farthest thing from your mind. You're in the
same mental space as a basketball player or a ballerina _ or a
conquistador. You are striving for a peak experience that depends
entirely on your understanding of objects in space and being able
to control them.
</P>
<P>
   People who make great video games understand this, and when they
make a video game based on a movie, their mission is to transform a
linear narrative into a series of 3-D environments. They're not
auteurs. They're architects. ``The first thing we do when we talk
to Pixar is look at the script and pick out high points of action
that are no-brainers,'' Winters said. ``OK, obviously we're going
to have a platform piece, so let's incorporate this. Or hey, a
tarmac area is really cool. We're jumping on a luggage piece,
that's a pretty good action-oriented scene, let's do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is a game _ a set of rules, objects and missions _
whose sequence of environments tracks to the sequence of
environments you see in the movie. The rest is apples and oranges.
It's not about loyalty, personal conflict and clever one-liners.
It's about collecting coins, finding all of Bo Peep's sheep in
hard-to-reach crevices of the house and returning Potato Head's
lost ear so he will give you the Cosmic Shield that allows you to
walk on toxic green sludge in the basement.
</P>
<P>
   It's about hopping and jumping, with target practice. It's about
mobility and being able to maneuver skillfully through your
environment.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Buzz Lightyear works so well as the hero. ``Buzz is
all about cool moves,'' Winters said. ``He's all about attachments
and cool moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does a swirl thing where he's an acrobat _ he jumps onto a
pole and swings around it. He can climb up on a pole. We wanted the
player to have fun just controlling Buzz Lightyear, connecting with
that character. So that's how everything is driven.''
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom says that interactive media is becoming more
and more cinematic, because the resolution of computer game images
is nibbling at the heels of video. But games are developing a
distinct grammar of their own. In fact, action movies may be
borrowing more from video games than vice versa (witness ``The
Matrix'' and ``Run Lola Run'').
</P>
<P>
   The two media converge on a superficial level, but fundamentally
they remain distinct. Invariably, gamers skip lengthy cinematic
sequences to get to the interactive part. Moviegoers don't want to
be responsible for ``Game Over'' in the second reel. Films relieve
you of that responsibility. They mitigate your risk _ you don't
have to fight the battles. You can be transported by the hero. And
amid the chase scenes, close scrapes and explosions, you can even
imagine what it would be like to play him in a video game.

 &HT;    Jesus' death quick by Roman standards
 &HT;    By Douglas Belkin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The spikes nailed through Jesus' wrists
and ankles did not kill him. The crown of thorns that cut into his
brow was little more than a nuisance, and the whipping he enduring
before he was crucified was almost an act of mercy.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus Christ, like the tens of thousands who were crucified
before and after him, died because he could not breathe.
</P>
<P>
   By hanging someone by their arms, a crucifix forced a victim's
diaphragm to lift the weight of their torso and lower body in order
to raise the abdominal wall and give the lungs room to expand. With
the added weight, that diaphragm slowly exhausts. When it can no
longer expand, the lungs have no room to inflate. Jesus was able to
take in less and less air until he suffocated.
</P>
<P>
   As sadistic as the physics of a basic crucifixion sound, the
Romans had engineered methods to make it worse. By placing a small
hump on the vertical post of the crucifix at the small of the
victim's back, the condemned could save himself, for awhile, by
raising himself onto the hump and taking some weight off his
diaphragm. Eventually, his arms would exhaust and he would sink
back down and start the process of suffocation again.
</P>
<P>
   Christ didn't have this opportunity, and in some small way the
Romans were merciful to him. The nails they pounded through his
ankles would have made it impossible for him to raise himself, and
the whipping, the crown of thorns and the spikes through his wrists
_ pounded not through the delicate tissue of the hands, but between
the sturdier bones that run between the elbow and wrist _ would
also bleed every time he shifted his weight. Taken together, all
these things would have weakened him further and hastened his
death.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it could have been worse. By the time Christ was hung on
the cross, the Romans had plenty of practice honing the science of
crucifixion. They had inherited the method from the Persians, who
had pioneered it about 500 years earlier, according to the Rev. J.
Brabban, chairman of the religion and philosophy department at Palm
Beach Atlantic College in West Palm Beach. But instead of a cross,
the Persians lashed the wrists and ankles of the condemned to the
four corners of a device that looked like the letter X.
</P>
<P>
   The Romans raised the crucifix onto a post a few feet above the
ground to better expose the condemned. The point, after all, was
not just to execute, but to torture and to set an example for
others who were considering breaking the law.
</P>
<P>
   It was, no doubt, effective. It could take almost a week to die.
But in Jesus' case, ``it was probably over in six hours,'' said
Brabban.
</P>
<P>
   Crucifixion continued as a form of execution through the fourth
century, Brabban said. But by then, with Christianity spreading, it
stopped being used because anyone crucified would appear
Christlike. And the point of an execution, after all, is to kill
people, not to martyr them.

 FOR BRADLEY AND McCAIN, TROUBLE ON THE HOME FRONT  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The ancient truism that no man is a hero to his
servant goes back at least to Plutarch in the second century; put
another way, it means familiarity often breeds contempt.
</P>
<P>
   This theme is constantly updated with modern political examples,
in sad, hilarious or even useful ways. A classic example is the
repeated failure of Franklin Roosevelt, one of our greatest
presidents, to carry his home constituency of Hyde Park, an enclave
of conservative, wealthy New York Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The latest is the trouble Democratic presidential challenger
Bill Bradley and Republican contender John McCain are having in
winning unanimous support from officeholders back home who are
supposed to be their partisan soulmates.
</P>
<P>
   The theory of party unity is not as strong as the reality of
personal rivalry born of competing ambitions and clashing
interests.
</P>
<P>
   The locals may indeed know too much about the candidates to
endorse them without reservation, just because they share a
philosophical affiliation. And ``all bow down'' is not a winning
appeal to men and women who have their own positions of influence,
no matter how limited.
</P>
<P>
   Really strong candidates can overcome such resistance. The
coattails of a successful favorite son can serve as a ladder to
lift all with access into the perfumed White House atmosphere of
perks and power. This can be very tempting indeed.
</P>
<P>
   That's when a contrary rule applies: it is better to deal with
the bum you know than one you don't. So it has been for Texas Gov.
George Bush, who sewed up not only his state's most prominent
Republican officeholders early in the game but most of his fellow
GOP governors and a clutch of other GOP officials around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The only Texas Republican holdout thus far is Rep. Ron Paul, who
ran for the White House in 1988 on the Libertarian Party ticket and
is currently staying mum.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore's native Tennessee, which he represented
in the House and Senate for 16 years until tapped as Bill Clinton's
running mate, is a swing state that is now more Republican than
Democratic. The four Democratic members of Congress have endorsed
him, but of course the five GOP members, the two GOP senators and
the GOP governors oppose him.
</P>
<P>
   It is the situation of Bradley and McCain that is the most
politically intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was a senator from New Jersey for three terms and is the
first candidate from the state with a viable shot at the White
House since Woodrow Wilson, who won. Yet not one member of New
Jersey's congressional delegation _ past members as well as the
seven current Democrats _ has endorsed him. Democratic Sen. Frank
Lautenberg campaigns for Gore; his counterpart, Robert Torricelli,
vice chairman of the party's Senate campaign committee, has not
intervened in the primary.
</P>
<P>
   The basic rap against Bradley is that he was intellectually
distant and unresponsive to his colleagues' interests. He was a bit
too above the fray for the likes of those condemned to survive in
the middle of it. His record on behalf of New Jersey shows he did
deliver in some ways, but apparently he did not try as hard as he
should have.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's problem in his home state of Arizona is the opposite;
he has been in the faces of some fellow Republican too often in
ways they loathe. He's a tough guy, and if you don't go along with
him his reactions can be harsh.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jane Hull leads the battle cry against him, filling the
media with descriptions of a temper she finds uncontrollable and
disqualifying for the presidency. She has on her side several other
statewide officeholders. Former House minority leader John Rhodes,
whose retirement opened a House seat to McCain, also backs Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Yet not all Arizona politicians are hostile to McCain. The
junior senator, John Kyl, is McCain's national co-chairman. Four of
the five GOP House members back McCain. The fifth, Rep. Bob Stump,
did not respond to repeated phone calls seeking his position.
</P>
<P>
   So does it matter much whether the home team is solidly behind
the local star? It's a sign of some weakness. But it need not be
fatal, if the state's voters decide they like the guy at the top
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley and McCain need to carry their state primaries if they
are to go all the way to their party nominations. Right now that
looks doubtful in both cases.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the last year, Lewis Lipnick has tested high-end audio cables
from 28 manufacturers. As a professional musician with the National
Symphony Orchestra and as an audio consultant, he counts on his
exacting ear to tell him if changing cables affects the accuracy of
the sound from his $25,000 Krell amplifiers.
</P>
<P>
   His personal choice is a pair of speaker wires that cost
$13,000. ``Anyone would have to have cloth ears not to tell the
difference between cables,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my professional opinion that's baloney,'' said Alan P.
Kefauver, a classically trained musician and director of the
Recording Arts and Sciences program at the Peabody Institute of
Johns Hopkins University. ``Has the wire been cryogenically frozen?
Is it flat or round? It makes no difference, unless it makes you
feel better.'' His choice for speaker wire? Good-quality 16-gauge
zip wire.
</P>
<P>
   The disagreement would be unnotable except for one thing:
experts are in agreement that most cables that claim to improve the
sound of audio equipment don't. Even some cables costing thousands
of dollars per foot are little more than sonic snake oil, experts
say.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRUM)
</P>
<P>
   Consumers trying to purchase audio cables often find themselves
buying high-end replacements because the only cables in the store
are expensive ones.
</P>
<P>
   A purchaser of an entry-level $550 stereo system might be sent
home with $55 worth of the least expensive middle-quality audio
cables. While experts agree that most cables make exaggerated and
unfounded claims about improving sound, they cannot agree on which
cables actually do improve sound and which do not.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The scientific record is unclear. So far no research paper
contending to prove or disprove the value of fancy wires has been
accepted by the leading industry publication, The Journal of the
Audio Engineering Society, said Patricia M. MacDonald, its
executive editor. She said there were dozens of reasons a research
paper might not meet her journal's standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone should infer anything from it,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturers and sellers of audio goods like to stay above
the fray. Cables are a highly lucrative item that may account for a
modest percentage of sales but a greater percentage of profit.
</P>
<P>
   Even audio manufacturers not directly involved in the cable
business like to steer clear of the debate.
</P>
<P>
   Polk Audio, a well respected manufacturer of loudspeakers in
Baltimore, no longer makes cables but declined an invitation to set
up a listening test in its laboratories. One reason it gave was
that the test could affect relationships with audio stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would be hearing from every retailer in the country,'' said
Paul Dicomo, head of marketing for Polk Audio.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Moyer, staff director for the Consumer Electronics
Association, which represents manufacturers, said accessory items _
wires included _ usually carry the highest markup. Sales of
high-margin accessories have become critical in the current market,
where prices of components like receivers, amplifiers and DVD
players have had profit margins squeezed by competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It becomes a question of where are we going to make a little
money?'' he said. Moyer, whose $3,000 sound system uses about $300
worth of cables, said the technological superiority of a cable is
not the issue _ it is the perceived value to the hobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone feels good about buying it, whether it works or it
doesn't, it makes them feel good,'' he said. ``I don't think we
should question.''
</P>
<P>
   John Dunlavy, who manufactures audiophile loudspeakers and wire
to go with them, does think questioning is valid. A musician and
engineer, Dunlavy said as an academic exercise he used principles
of physics relating to transmission line and network theory to
produce a high-end cable. ``People ask if they will hear a
difference, and I tell them no,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dunlavy has often gathered audio critics in his Colorado Springs
lab for a demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we do is kind of dirty and stinky,'' he said. ``We say we
are starting with a 12 WAG zip cord, and we position a technician
behind each speaker to change the cables out.''
</P>
<P>
   The technicians hold up fancy-looking cables before they
disappear behind the speakers. The critics debate the sound
characteristics of each wire.
</P>
<P>
   ``They describe huge changes and they say, `Oh my God, John,
tell me you can hear that difference,''' Dunlavy said. The trick is
the technicians never actually change the cables, he said, adding,
``It's the placebo effect.''
</P>
<P>
   This leads to disagreements based on competing science. Bruce
Brisson, who owns Music Interface Technology, a manufacturer of
very high-end wire in Rockland, Calif., also wants to see cable
charlatans revealed and may use his extensive laboratory to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am getting ready to expose this in the year 2000,'' he said.
``People are paying a lot of money and getting nothing for it.''
But he disagreed with Dunlavy on the effectiveness of wires. He
said that the theory Dunlavy uses is not the appropriate one for
cable design, which explains why listeners cannot hear a
difference, a contention hotly disputed by Dunlavy.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists say it would be difficult to prove one way or
another. Changing cables leaves a time lapse that makes comparison
difficult. Putting several stereos side by side with the different
wires would man that the speakers would be different distances
from the ear, which could have an effect. And while a switch could
be made that would send a signal through each of several cables to
a speaker from a single sound system, cable makers say the switch
itself might spoil the advantages of their wires.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the difficulty is that there are still unexplained
acoustic phenomena. William Morris Hartmann, a professor of physics
at Michigan State University in East Lansing, works on
psycho-acoustic projects, which investigate the way sound is
perceived, rather than the way it is produced.
</P>
<P>
   There are examples, he said, of sounds that measure beyond the
range of human hearing, and yet some people seem to perceive them.
That means the market is left open to wild claims and
psuedoscience. ``It's annoying, but it's hard to disprove,''
Hartmann said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the closest thing to middle ground is the position taken
by Russ Hamm, an electrical engineer whose New York company G Prime
installs digital processing equipment for studios.
</P>
<P>
   Hamm said that indeed, wires do make a perceivable difference,
but very little, and then only to professionals, like the engineers
at BMG Music. He lent them new high-grade cables for use on roughly
$250,000 of equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are talking subtle differences, but that is what the high
end is all about,'' he said. On his system, Hamm uses a specialty
cable manufactured in Vienna that costs $2 a foot.
</P>
<P>
   It is a subtlety he describes as a 2 percent difference on a
high-end system. ``If you had a fine Bordeaux wine, how much does
it matter if it's in a nice wineglass or a Riedel crystal glass?''
</P>
<P>
   His advice to audiophiles: ``I would say that you want to put
the first $10,000 into your equipment.''

 &HT;    Fortune says Ivester was ambushed
 &HT;    By David McNaughton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ M. Douglas Ivester got mugged in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   That's Fortune's (Jan. 10) explanation for Ivester's sudden
decision to retire as chairman and chief executive officer of
Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   As Fortune tells it, Ivester was in Chicago on Dec. 1 for a
meeting with executives of McDonald's. But while he was in town, he
also met with Warren Buffett and Herbert Allen. Those ``800-pound
gorillas'' of Coca-Cola's board told Ivester he no longer was the
man for Coke, Fortune says.
</P>
<P>
   No decision was reached in Chicago about what to do next, the
magazine says. But Ivester wasted no time. On Sunday he quit, a
victim of his own arrogance and insecurity, according to Fortune.
</P>
<P>
   CLOSING THE GENDER GAP IS ALL IN THE NUMBERS
</P>
<P>
   What's a woman to do when she's looking for an employer who will
offer the most opportunities for advancement? Well, she could go to
work for one of the 25 companies identified by Working Woman
(January). All have proved they are committed to giving women a
shot at the top, the magazine says.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of the list: Avon. No. 2, and new to the list this
year: Charles Schwab.
</P>
<P>
   IT'S A TOUGH JOB, BUT SOMEBODY HAS TO DO IT
</P>
<P>
   ``Predicting the next 1,000 years is a breeze compared to
predicting the next 12 months.''
</P>
<P>
   So says Business Week in its year-end double issue (Dec. 27/Jan.
3). Nonetheless, the magazine takes a stab at predicting what
investors should watch. Among its forecasts: ``The big story of
2000 is likely to be tech stocks _ how far and how fast they will
rise.''
</P>
<P>
   Also in Business Week: If you think workers are in short supply
in the United States, take a look at Europe. It's estimated that
1.3 million information technology jobs could go begging next year.
That's on a continent with an unemployment rate of just under 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, which the magazine notes could hurt the region's
economic outlook, is that those without jobs don't have the needed
computer skills.
</P>
<P>
   ARE YOU ALREADY LOST ON THE INTERNET HIGHWAY?
</P>
<P>
   The heavyweights of corporate America may be moving too slowly
to embrace the Internet and the opportunities and savings it
offers, argues Barron's (Dec. 20). Of the 30 companies in the Dow
Jones industrial average, 19 seem to have comprehensive Internet
strategies, Barron's says. Another five were deemed to have ''sort
of'' gotten the point. Six just don't get it, according to the
publication.
</P>
<P>
   IT'S TAKE-YOUR-PICK TIME
</P>
<P>
   Kiplinger's Personal Finance (January) offers cutting-edge
funds. Bloomberg Personal Finance (December) provides a list of
technology stocks that bear watching.
</P>
<P>
   The theory at Kiplinger's is that technology, pharmaceuticals
and finance are the sectors in which investors should have money,
and the funds it picks are a way to get there.
</P>
<P>
   Also in Bloomberg Personal Finance: The best electronic toys for
executives.

   The New York Times' computer football ranking is based on an
analysis of each team's scores with emphasis on three factors: who
won, by what margin and against what quality of opposition. The
quality of an opponent is determined by examining its record
against other teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Times' computer model collapses runaway scores and takes
note of a home-field advantage. Recent games count more than
earlier games.
</P>
<P>
   The top team is assigned a rating of 1.000; the ratings of all
other teams are percentages reflecting their strength relative to
the top team. This week, for example, there is a fairly small
difference between Indianapolis (No. 1) and St. Louis (2), and a
larger difference between Indianapolis (1) and Kansas City (4).

   FBN-SAINTS (New Orleans) _ Even for a franchise that has been as
historically inept as the New Orleans Saints, this season is
shaping up as one of the worst in memory. Between Mike Ditka's
frequent outbursts and Ricky Williams' more-frequent injuries, the
Saints have been a walking and talking disaster area this season.
As they head into their final two games of the season _ and

&HT;     Y2K ALERT EXTENDS TO JAN. 3 AND BEYOND 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 &HT;     c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The world-wide Y2K alert doesn't end on New Year's
Day.
</P>
<P>
   Specialists in preventing Y2K computer glitches say that most
Y2K problems probably won't reveal themselves until Monday, Jan. 3,
when millions of Americans return to work and school. Some experts
think Y2K computer glitches could pop up throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real test will be on Mondaywhen millions of transactions
and events take place as they normally do,'' said John Koskinen,
the White House's Y2K czar.
</P>
<P>
   Even though government and private-industry computers have been
tested to make sure they can properly read the digits ``00'' as the
year 2000, the true test will come Monday, Jan. 3, when computer
systems are used in normal operations rather than in a test-mode,
according to Koskinen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's highly unlikely anybody's lights or telephone are going
to go off immediately,'' Koskinen said. It would likely take a
whole series of computer problems to build up before a Y2K computer
collapse causes a large system to malfunction or shut down, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Norm Dean, the executive director of the Washington, D.C.-based
non-profit Center for Y2K and Society, agrees that Jan. 1 isn't the
crucial date. The ``majority of events related to Y2K will occur
Jan. 3 and beyond,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   While key U.S. systems like telecommunications and electric
power are expected to continue to function normally on Jan. 1 and
beyond, Koskinen said power failures could occur in undeveloped
countries beginning in early January.
</P>
<P>
   And the United States won't be immune to problems even though
the federal government and major private industries from airlines
to telecommunications have tested and re-tested their computers to
properly read the digits ``00.''
</P>
<P>
   If computers that contain date-sensitive chips read ``00'' as
the year 1900, they may malfunction and potentially disrupt larger
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Koskinen nor Dean predicts any large national or
regional Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we'll see planes fall out of the sky or
widespread power outages,'' Dean said. ``But there are going to be
problems in specific areas...that could affect a number of
people.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said most of the nation's one million non-profit
organizations have done nothing to address Y2K issues, which could
affect the services they provide to millions of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Another potential problem stems from the fact that many small
businesses have done nothing to prepare for Y2K. The National
Federation of Independent Businesses reports that 1.5 million small
companies are simply taking a wait-and-see approach to see if cash
registers, or security or refrigeration systems fail when they open
their doors on Jan. 3 after being closed for the holiday weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem is that businesses may not be able to find
someone to fix their failed systems on a timely basis.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
reports that many doctors' offices and hospitals haven't tested
their billing systems to make sure they will be able to request
payments from the federal government's Medicare and Medicaid
systems and private insurers _ problems that won't begin occurring
until the end of January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a computer break down in January may not affect a small
business or its employees until later in the year,'' Dean said,
explaining that employees likely won't lose their jobs on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   A failed small business could affect a larger firm if the
smaller firm were a key supplier to the larger company. Those
problems likely won't crop up until the end of January or later.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen said other Y2K problems might also surface later in
January or toward the end of the first quarter in March when the
first bills with 2000 dates on them are sent out. For example, some
water customers in West Des Moines, Iowa, last week received bills
with a due date of Jan. 3, 1900.

<P>
   The problem with passwords is that there are so many of them, a
problem the computer industry is confronting with solutions that
range from virtual key rings to smart cards that do all of the
logging in for you.
</P>
<P>
   The basic solution is to store the passwords in a file called a
key ring. This file is usually encrypted with a master password,
ideally one that is easy to remember.
</P>
<P>
   Key rings have been used for many years, but lately researchers
have concentrated on making them easier to use by integrating them
with the many Web sites that require passwords.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers also are experimenting with putting more information
into key rings and adding automated features that look up
passwords. The latest version of the Mac OS comes with an
integrated tool that unlocks the key ring with a spoken phrase. You
can also encrypt the files on your Mac and store the password in
the central key ring.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, researchers are re-examining how key rings protect
passwords and other confidential data. Netscape's Web browser
stores the e-mail passwords of users in a primitive key ring. Last
week, several code breakers at Reliable Software Technologies in
Dulles, Va., announced that they had cracked the protection in a
short time using pencil and paper.
</P>
<P>
   Gary McGraw, the chief technology officer at Reliable Software,
which makes an extra effort to ensure that its software does not
crash, emphasized the danger of poorly designed key rings.
</P>
<P>
   Most people use the same password for everything, McGraw said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you knock over someone's poorly protected machine at home,
get their password and then use it to get into someone's corporate
machine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Or their bank account, or their Amazon account, or ... the list
goes on.
</P>
<P>
   One of the latest solutions to the problem is a tool called
v-GO, from the New York City based company Passlogix. The tool
stores basic passwords for Web sites and mail servers using the
common strategy of creating a central encrypted file.
</P>
<P>
   What is novel about the tool is its integration with Web
browsers to keep track of what sites are visited and what user name
and password are used at each one. The software matches the user
name and password to the URL and automatically enters the proper
data in the forms. Users can also include addresses and phone
numbers if they wish.
</P>
<P>
   The tool also allows you to change your identity as you change
sites, from ``WB123'' at one place to ``Koosbane41'' at another,
for example.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Boroditsky, the chief executive of Passlogix, says that his
company plans to integrate its key ring with public-key encryption
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the future,'' Boroditsky said, ``we want to handle online
banking and medical records.''
</P>
<P>
   In a public-key encryption system, a person has a public key and
a private key. The public key scrambles a message and may be used
by anyone, but the private key that is needed to unscramble the
message must be kept secret by the person who holds it.
</P>
<P>
   The newer key rings promise to hold private keys and manage the
construction of digital signatures that can be used to endorse
transactions. These digital signatures are more secure than
passwords because they change with each transaction.
</P>
<P>
   A doctor might request a copy of an X-ray or a diagnosis and use
an online key ring to sign the request with a digital signature.
</P>
<P>
   Digital signatures are created by complex cryptographic codes
and are designed to mimic pen-and-paper signatures. In this case,
only someone with the password to the key ring can add a signature
to a document. Banks and other institutions that depend upon
pen-and-paper signatures hope to save time and money by recognizing
digital signatures.
</P>
<P>
   Boroditsky also said that Passlogix is exploring ways of
encouraging users to select passwords that are truly random, like
the time of day, instead of words that might be susceptible to
guessing, like a birth date, an address or the name of a child or a
pet.
</P>
<P>
   In the long term, passwords will be stored on smart cards and
other secure hardware. McGraw said that his company could have
found the passwords stored by Netscape even if Netscape had used
the most secure encryption available.
</P>
<P>
   PC software is inherently insecure because all parts of the
computer are accessible.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Farmer, the president of the Smart Card Forum, says that
the smart-card technology is being embraced by many companies that
need secure and convenient protection that goes beyond passwords.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think authentication and privacy are going to be the
driver,'' Ms. Farmer said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, American Express has taken the lead in this area by
introducing a new brand of credit card _ called Blue _ with an
embedded smart card. The company hopes that its use of the smart
card to do a better job of protecting against fraud will attract a
significant portion of transactions made over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Confronted by a smart card, a potential thief cannot simply copy
a name, credit card number and expiration date. The thief would
have to copy the data stored inside the card _ a task that the
smart card designers have tried to make impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Gilstrap, a vice president at American Express, says that
the Internet transactions are just the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a good deal of excess capacity on these cards,''
Gilstrap said. ``There's a great potential to add new features
after issuance. I can't steal the thunder from our marketing
department, but the cardholder will be able to add new features
that fits their lifestyles in the future.''

 By PETER H. LEWIS  
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For many personal computer users, Y2K preparedness has meant
getting a date or finding a baby sitter and having sufficient
Champagne and MP3 party tunes on hand for New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   The digital event of the century is less than 10 days away, and
perhaps you are not quite certain whether you or your PC is going
to have the bigger hangover on Jan. 1. If so, here are some
last-minute tips.
</P>
<P>
   First, relax, it's not the very last minute. Yes, the so-called
Y2K bug is a big deal, already the costliest technology mistake in
history, and it still has the potential to cause serious problems.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, government and corporate computer managers worldwide have
been working on the problem for years, while you have been busy
playing solitaire and blasting aliens. But there is still plenty of
time to prepare your home PC for the new year.
</P>
<P>
   Most home computers and software applications made in the last
few years were designed with the Y2K transition in mind, so if
you're relatively new to computing, it may actually be in your
favor. That does not mean that the potential problems are
eliminated, just that they are minimized for newer computers.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the Y2K problem primarily affects programs that rely on
time-based calculations, which makes it of main interest to people
who use the computer for boring things like spreadsheets,
databases, personal finance programs and other accounting-type
applications. If all you do is play games, write e-mail and shop
online, you can probably forget about your PC and enjoy the
Champagne.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few basic checks that must be made to minimize the
risk of Y2K-related problems. But first, a warning. Many people
believe that the only thing they need to do to check the computer
for Y2K compliance is to reset their system clock to 12/31/99 and
11:59 p.m., switch the computer off for a couple of minutes, then
boot it up again. If everything appears to work properly, some
people may conclude that they have nothing to fear, and more than
likely they will be right.
</P>
<P>
   But Dawna Prussoff, a product manager at Symantec Corp., warned
that this simple do-it-yourself test is incomplete and could in
fact trigger the very problems that the user hopes to avoid.
Symantec has a financial interest in this issue, because it is one
of the many companies that sell Y2K diagnostic and repair programs.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these commercial Y2K utility programs cost less than
$50. Fifty bucks may seem like a lot of money for a program that
typically takes only a few minutes to diagnose what could be a
nonexistent problem. But it can also be thought of as a convenient
form of insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the most highly rated Y2K packages for Windows computers
are Symantec's Norton 2000 ($49.95, www.symantec.com/sabu/n2000/)
and Greenwich Mean Time's Check 2000 PC Deluxe ($34.95,
www.gmt-2000.com). They check your system's BIOS (basic input
output system), the operating system, major applications and in
many cases even your data files, right down to the spreadsheet
cells and database fields. In most cases they can repair any
problems they encounter.
</P>
<P>
   Both Norton 2000 and Check 2000 PC Deluxe can be downloaded from
their Web sites, which can save a trip to the store. They also come
in a package with printed documentation.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a good idea to log on to one of the many Web sites
that offer Y2K resources. (If you don't have an Internet
connection, make getting one your No. 2 New Year's resolution in
the computer category, right after backing up your hard disk.)
</P>
<P>
   There are good reference areas at the Symantec Web site and at
www.zdnet.com/zdhelp/filers/y2k/. These sites and many others, like
www.download.com, have lots of free utility programs that you can
download to test the BIOS, whose tasks include telling the
operating system what year it is. Your operating system passes
along the date and time information to your software applications.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   So, if your older BIOS thinks every year begins with a 19,
``00'' in any two-digit date fields (as in 01/01/00) will be
translated as Jan. 1, 1900, and that is when things could start
going haywire.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, the BIOS will pass all tests. In a few cases, you
may only need to download a software patch to update the BIOS to
recognize the new century. In a few rare cases, especially in older
machines, no easy BIOS software patches are available and you will
have to contact either the PC maker or the BIOS maker for help.
</P>
<P>
   In these cases, you will really have to scamper to make the
fixes in time. Or, in the rare case that you have lots of money
left over after the holiday shopping season, you can run out and
buy a new PC, put on a party hat and pretend that you are having
fun spending the last hours of 1999 transferring your old data to
the new machine.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the BIOS is up to date, there could be problems in
the operating system. Most people use Microsoft Windows, so a visit
to www.microsoft.com/technet/year2k/ is in order. There are some
known Y2K glitches in Windows 95, Windows 98 and Windows NT, but
they can almost always be fixed easily with software patches.
</P>
<P>
   The Apple Macintosh was designed from the start to handle
four-digit year dates, and thus the Mac itself is relatively immune
to most Y2K issues.
</P>
<P>
   Before they get too smug, however, Mac users must still make
sure their software applications are Y2K compliant, especially
those that perform date-based calculations. Apple has a Y2K
information page on the Web at www.apple.com/about/year2000/.
</P>
<P>
   Checking the applications on your computer is the next level of
testing. Even if the BIOS and operating systems pass the tests, the
programs themselves may get the hiccups when 2000 arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Again, the primary concerns are any programs that make
calculations based on dates and times, like databases, spreadsheets
and personal finance programs. People who run a small business on
their home PC will want to pay especially close attention to
accounting, banking and payroll programs.
</P>
<P>
   Some people have dozens of programs on their PCs, and it may be
impractical to check them all at this late date. So make a list of
the most important programs and start there. By the way, if you
manage a nuclear reactor from your home PC, it would be nice to
notify your neighbors before you go off to the first party.
</P>
<P>
   The special programs like Norton 2000 and Check 2000 PC Deluxe
maintain updated databases of hundreds of popular programs and
check them all automatically. The manual alternative is to write
down the version numbers of all your major applications and visit
each vendor's Web site to check the Y2K compliance statement.
</P>
<P>
   It may be necessary to upgrade to newer versions. Obviously,
this is something best done well ahead of the last hours of 1999.
In some cases the upgrade may be free, but in others you may have
to buy an updated version.
</P>
<P>
   America Online users can check to see if their software is
compliant by going to AOL keyword Y2K. One interesting discovery:
America Online says the relatively recent AOL version 4.0 with
Internet Explorer 4.01 ``will not be certified Y2K compliant'' and
urges customers to upgrade to AOL 5.0.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not with AOL's software but with the Microsoft
browser. AOL 4.0 will work fine with an upgraded browser, which can
be downloaded free from Microsoft's site.
</P>
<P>
   The almost final step, and the one that is potentially the most
time consuming, is to examine your data files. Perhaps you wrote a
spreadsheet or database macro that makes date-based calculations.
As mentioned earlier, some of the better Y2K utility packages can
test data files automatically.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, as a great philosopher of the 20th century once said,
it ain't over till it's over. It is a good idea to test your
systems periodically for the first few months of 2000, especially
if people send you new files, being particularly alert for computer
viruses that come in masquerading as Y2K bug problems and fixes.
</P>
<P>
   On the bright side, all this attention about Y2K has caused PC
and software makers to plan ahead. Apple tells me my Macintosh is
capable of handling dates accurately until the year 29,940. What a
relief.

   BUSH-CRASHADS _ AUSTIN, Texas _ In a new campaign tactic aimed
at connecting with local voters, Gov. George W. Bush is airing TV
commercials targeted to run during newscasts the same day the ads
are produced. The concept, called ``crash ads'' by Bush
strategists, is being tested in New Hampshire, a key early

   DRUGS-LAUNDER _ ATLANTA _ For three years, agents with the U.S.
Drug Enforcement Administration and the Internal Revenue Service
masqueraded as a metro Atlanta stock brokerage whose brokers were
willing to wink at the law to launder millions in illicit drug
profits. On Wednesday, as federal agents froze bank accounts across
the globe, the DEA announced the results of the investigation _
which has led to the seizure of an estimated $26.2 million in U.S.
currency, 3,600 kilos of cocaine, and 340 bank accounts used by
Colombian drug traffickers and the money brokers who converted
their illegal earnings into legitimate profits. The investigation
has also led to the arrest of 40 people in nine U.S. cities and two
foreign countries. Another 20 remain at large, including five

   ETHICS-TEXAS _ AUSTIN _ Beginning next year, Texans should be
able to look on the Internet to get information about campaign

whether contributions to a candidate from a Bob Smith and a B.
Smith from downtown Houston are from the same person,''said Fred
Lewis, executive director of Campaigns for People, an Austin
nonprofit that pushes for open government. ``It becomes even more
difficult when there are B. Smiths, R. Smiths, R.E. Smiths, Bobby
Smiths, Bob Smiths and Robert Smiths giving to hundreds of
political action committees and candidates.'' But the law says
donors' addresses must be deleted from the cyberspace reports. Now,
the question is whether addresses can be included on computer

BACKPACK HOLDS UNTOLD SECRETS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC CELESTE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Upon becoming a father, I worried what sort of emotional trauma
I could cause that would send my daughter into therapy. I was
fairly cocky, as only the young and heretofore childless can be, so
I concluded that I could, through attentive parenting, ensure that
she would never be forced to endure $175-an-hour counseling. I
didn't count on ``Doughnuts for Dads.''
</P>
<P>
   My daughter, a kindergartner, was about to leave for school one
recent Wednesday morning. It was 7:30 a.m. My wife had been up
since 5:30 to exercise, shower, make breakfast, dress the daughter,
dress herself, make lunch and work up a healthy irritation at my
laziness. I rolled out of bed in time to kiss my daughter goodbye.
My daughter stood there, staring at me, confused.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, Daddy, today is `Doughnuts for Dads.' ''
</P>
<P>
   My wife and I stared at each other as if to say, ``What is she
talking about, and can I somehow blame this on you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Honey, what is it?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doughnuts for Dads. It's today.''
</P>
<P>
   The wife seized control: ``She's probably making it up. If there
was an event today, I'd have known about it. We check her backpack
every day.'' As most readers know, the backpack is the only source
of information about what a schoolchild's day was like, since kids'
only response to parental inquiry is always, ``Nothin'.'' The
backpack is the dig site for the anthropological team of Mom and
Dad, who reconstruct the daily routine of Child by piecing together
clues from construction paper, handouts and color-coded homework
assignments. (''Ah hah. According to her homework, honey, today she
learned how to day-trade.'')
</P>
<P>
   I sized up the situation. It was 7:35, and the wife needed to
get to work. But if there was a school-sponsored event _ apparently
involving the exchange of fathers for sugar-coated dough _ I could
not miss it. A school full of every Dad EXCEPT ME is the sort of
memory that psychiatrists could later connect to the words
``breakthrough'' and ``increasing your dosage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm jumping in the shower. Take her to school, and, if you see
anything unusual, call me,'' I said. ``I'll fly there.''
</P>
<P>
   Five minutes later, when I exited the shower, I heard the
screech of tires in the driveway. The door opened violently, and a
frantic wife appeared before me and my towel-clad splendor. ``There
are ACRES of dads there. No moms in sight. I strongly suggest you
... ''
</P>
<P>
   I was way ahead of her. No time to make it to the closet _ throw
on clothes next to bed, which are easy to find because I can smell
them; spray cologne on face to hide bad breath; think of evil
things I will do to person who put no notice of doughnut day in
daughter's backpack. It was 7:52.
</P>
<P>
   I wouldn't want to say that I exceeded the speed limit on my way
to school; given the public's waning trust in the news media, I
wouldn't want to lie, either. So let's skip the drive. When I
arrived, I saw a line of fathers and their children stretching
outside the cafeteria onto the sidewalk. We were second-to-last in
line. Last in line was a father whose daughter had told him the
incorrect day.
</P>
<P>
   As we snaked toward the doughnut table, we two sad-sack dads
discussed how insane it is that our kids so rarely let us know what
is going on day to day. (It turned out that most kids had notices
sent home about the doughnut event.) It's especially strange since,
until school begins, a child's every step outside the house is
monitored and controlled.
</P>
<P>
   That's when I saw the table. The table full of toys. The pile of
toys was growing, since each father, before securing a doughnut for
himself and his offspring, was placing a toy for charity atop the
pile.
</P>
<P>
   I turned to last-in-line dad, terror-stricken. He had that look,
that ``Oh, too bad for you'' look, on his face when he held up his
toy. ``I see my daughter told me a little more than yours,
though.''
</P>
<P>
   A scene years hence flashed in my mind. ``So, your father
withholds gifts from the needy? Let's discuss that next week. One
hundred seventy-five dollars, please.''
</P>

   It was sundown on the prairie. I placed a hand above my brow and
squinted toward the western horizon. The dying rays of the fireball
made long shadows as the cowpokes strolled down Main Street. I
sighed and wiped my hands on my apron for the 100th time.
</P>
<P>
   Where is that kid the folks call Willie, I wondered aloud. He
said he'd return long before the Harvest Moon peeped over Twobucks
Ridge. I'd been watching and waiting for half an hour, but there
was nary a sign of that man-child. Just as I turned to head back
into the saloon, a cloud of dust appeared among the cactuses in the
desert on the outskirts of town.
</P>
<P>
   Then, I heard ole One-Boot Kevin yell at the top of his lungs:
``He's coming! The Kid is back!''
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff fired his pistol into the air six times. It could
have been a warning, but then again, maybe he was just excited
about his new gun. Either way, folks grabbed their younguns and
headed indoors in a hurry. I, too, deserted the dusty road. Not
that I was afraid of Willie, but that half-blind horse of his was a
bit unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   I was behind the bar fixing a sarsaparilla when The Kid strolled
through the flapping doors. He paused and looked around the room.
The piano grew quiet, and everyone froze. In the corner, the
drifter known as Nobody let out an eerie whistle and retreated
beneath his poncho like a turtle in a stampede. Somebody Jones
laughed, but he hasn't been right since that horse kicked him in
the ear last year. The rest of us kept our eyes on The Kid.
</P>
<P>
   The Kid looked at me and tipped his hat. Then he blinked his
right eye three times and said, ``Evening, Ma.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Evening, Kid,'' I replied. ``I'll have your supper right
out.''
</P>
<P>
   He made his way to the back of the room and sat down at the
table with his brother, Sillie. Sillie grunted but didn't speak.
</P>
<P>
   Safe for now, everyone resumed their conversations and card
games. The piano man played a happy tune. A breeze came through the
door, bringing the odor of horse flesh and cow patties. All was
well.
</P>
<P>
   I came out of the kitchen carrying two plates. I placed one in
front of The Kid and one in front of Sillie. They bowed their heads
briefly and then Sillie picked up his fork.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wait!'' shouted The Kid.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, everyone froze.
</P>
<P>
   The Kid reached for his holster and we gasped in unison. I
started trembling as he slowly withdrew his _ ruler. He measured
Sillie's piece of Texas toast and then he measured his own.
Mercifully, they were the same dimensions. Then he pulled out a
meat scale from his boot and weighed the wieners. All was equal.
But then he began to count the beans.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, son. Don't do it,'' I pleaded. ``You're just gonna make
yourself upset. I promise you, it's all evenly distributed.
Besides, all those beans together don't amount to a hill. Please,
Kid, just eat. Why torture yourself like this?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the principle of the thing, Mama,'' he said. ``You say
that you love us the same, but you always give my brother a little
more food than me. He gets the biggest cookie. He gets a larger
slice of cake. Last week, he had half an ounce more water than me
in his bubble bath.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But, Kid, he's two years older than you and 60 pounds heavier!
Come on, Kid, you're not a bean counter. Stop the madness. You know
that I love you, boy.''
</P>
<P>
   But The Kid just kept counting those beans. In the corner, some
ranch hands were placing bets on the outcome of our family feud. I
couldn't stand by and see my family torn apart over something so
trivial.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in desperation, I said, ``Kid, if you love me, you'll
stop this nonsense and eat your supper.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kid looked at me. He put down his magnifying glass and
glared at his brother. Then he picked up his fork and started to
eat those cold beans.
</P>
<P>
   I looked up and thanked my lucky stars. We'd survived another
close one out here on the range. &QL;

DVD IS THE FUTURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LIZ STEVENS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I have seen the future _ and it's as clear as the pores on Billy
Bob Thornton's face.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is ``Armageddon,'' the place is Marvin Electronics in
Fort Worth, and the format _ oh, the beautiful format! _ is DVD.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin sales associate Scott Schuster has planted me in the
store's luxurious home-theater chamber, in front of a 140-inch
big-screen television, to display the technology that has
videophiles giddy. He turns down the lights, finagles with the
remote control, and there is Thornton's mug, looking more vivid and
creepy than it has ever been on home video.
</P>
<P>
   For thousands of movie buffs, DVD-Audio has given new meaning to
a trip to the video store.
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't heard of DVD, your ignorance is sure to be
short-lived. The acronym stands for digital versatile disc, and DVD
players are the fastest selling product in the history of consumer
electronics. Introduced in the United States in 1997, DVD players
will go home with 3.5 million consumers in 1999, analysts predict.
By contrast, it took six years after the VCR was introduced for
annual sales to surpass a million, in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   With DVD prices dropping to below $200 and the number of video
titles skyrocketing, DVD has become accessible to the masses.
According to the Consumer Electronics Association's 1999 Holiday
Purchase Pattern Survey, DVD players are the top item on the
holiday wish lists of people doing their Christmas shopping on the
Internet this season.
</P>
<P>
   The seduction of DVD lies in its visual and aural clarity. With
their improved resolution, DVDs make VHS tapes look as though
you're watching them through a dirty window.
</P>
<P>
   And the sound? Depending on your speaker system, DVD can make
you believe you're riding in ``Armageddon's'' asteroid-pelted
spaceship.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of DVD, both in the electronics industry and
among consumers, effectively killed competitor DIVX and is fast
shoving laserdisc technology into obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cassette tape is to the CD what the VCR tape is to DVD,''
Schuster says. ``We're selling more than we can get our hands on.''
</P>
<P>
   DVDs look just like CDs, but a basic DVD can store seven times
as much information as a standard CD. That's about 133 minutes'
worth of video and audio, enough for an entire movie plus extras.
And there are lots of extras to be had.
</P>
<P>
   DVDs can have up to eight separate audio or language tracks (so
you could watch ``Armageddon'' in Spanish or French, if you
wanted). Some videos include a film's theater trailer, interviews
with the actors and filmmakers, documentaries about the making of
the film, even alternate endings. (Want to know what might have
happened had Jeff Bridges not goofed at the end of ``Arlington
Road''? See it on DVD).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a neat toy, if you want to think of it as a toy, in the
respect that (DVDs) afford a lot of different features that people
aren't normally accustomed to with their VCR,'' says Tim McNamara,
the Consumer Electronics Association's manager of communications.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood and independent producers have embraced the format,
now even promoting DVD release dates. As of Dec. 15, 5,208
DVD-Video titles were available, according to Jeff Phillips' list,
www.thedvdlist.com. New releases include ``Ricky Martin: One Night
Only,'' as well as the 1973 classic ``Papillon.'' InfoTech, a
marketing forecast firm, predicts the availability of 20,000
DVD-Video titles by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Cost is another reason that aales of DVD players have tripled
from 1998. Low-end players can be had for less than $200, although
fully loaded models can run up to $4,000, according to the
Internet's Active Buyer's Guide (www1.activebuyersguide.com). The
discs average $20.
</P>
<P>
   The high-quality sound of the DVD-Video format is attributable
to Dolby Digital technology or Digital Theater System (DTS). All
DVDs on the market have the potential for Dolby Digital sound, but
DTS is the newer, better of the two, Schuster says. The hitch: Both
sound systems require five speakers and a subwoofer for full
effect, and most likely a separate receiver//decoder, too. Most of
us will have to settle for our television's two-speaker stereo
sound.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing DVD players seem to lack is the ability to
record. But that's set to change in 2000. Pioneer Electronics and
Philips Electronics have announced that they will introduce DVD
video recorders in the United States (Pioneer has already done so
in Japan). Still, prices will probably keep the average Joe from
taking part: $2,000 and up for the hardware and around $20 for
blank DVDs, says Michelle Abraham, a senior analyst at Cahners
In-Stat Group.
</P>
<P>
   DVD isn't just a video format. It soon hopes to be the standard
storage mechanism for audio, video and computer data. Several
companies are set to offer DVD-Audio (the next generation CD) in
2000, and newer generations of home computers include DVD-ROM
drives (to accommodate the next generation of CD-ROM).
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, don't toss the VCR. Even if it can't bring
``Armageddon'' to life in your living room, at least you've finally
figured out how to record ``Frasier'' when you're away from home.
</P>
<P>
   You have figured that out, haven't you?
</P>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you think you are too involved with your computer now,
prepare yourself. New games, gadgets and software eliminate the
distance that separates you from your desktop, meaning that the
face you see on the screen may look very much like your own.
</P>
<P>
   Programmers are delivering high-immersion, interactive games in
which players show up as themselves inside computer-generated
environments. Once there, they can be seen doing everything from
bounding down cartoon ski slopes to going foot-to-foot with a
vicious, karate-kicking enfant terrible; and to boot, all the
action is controlled by what the computer's video camera sees the
player doing.
</P>
<P>
   These at-home, computer-based games are far more advanced than
the virtual reality games commonly found in arcades, the kind that
require players to don geeky helmet-visors and gawky gloves, only
to stare into rudimentary backgrounds where the action is slow and
minimal.
</P>
<P>
   The first commercial examples of the new immersion technology,
sometimes called Video as Input, or VAI, are appearing in computer
games and activities with names like VBall (an on-screen volleyball
game), Horse (a basketball shooting contest) and Club Tune, a
virtual dance hall in which music played by a combo of cartoon
mutts changes tempo to match the movements of the players.
</P>
<P>
   Game packages are available from Reality Fusion and Intel Play,
and other companies are expected to follow soon. The big leap
forward that they represent, some technologists say, is that the
richer action can be controlled without the use of a keyboard, a
mouse or any other physical input device, including those gawky
gloves. And the new games work by making both the game and the
player virtual.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is sort of amazing,'' Joshua Silver, a research analyst for
InfoTrends Research Group in Boston, said of the new game
technology. ``It is definitely a huge step forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Brett Bogar, Mattel's director of product design for
Mattel-Intel Play Laboratory, the joint venture that designed the
Me2Cam game system, agreed. ``It is cutting edge technology,''
Bogar said. ``In the coming years you are going to see more and
more products using this kind of technology. You're going to see it
become more and more refined.''
</P>
<P>
   Although games may represent the first popular use of virtual
controls, the technology could have applications far beyond popping
on-screen bubbles. Some observers speculated that students could
use the technology in virtual classrooms, including trips to a
virtual blackboard. Virtual meetings, in which participants around
the world could interact at a computer-generated conference table,
could also be managed with video input technology.
</P>
<P>
   The new technology could be used for training, providing virtual
assembly lines on which workers could practice without the risk of
disrupting production, said Dr. David Albert, a technology
consultant and president of Albert-Battaglin Consulting Group in
Soquel, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``This technology offers potential uses that are very broad and
very sophisticated,'' he said. ``The concept of interacting with
the computer via the camera, using video as input, offers a whole
extension of applications.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to the games' operation is their capacity to read visual
and motion cues from players and translate them into electronic
commands. The technology could also be used, Silver said, to coach
patients through physical therapy in their homes and to
revolutionize electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   But Frederico Faggin, one of the designers of the first
commercial microprocessor and an expert on the interaction of
humans and machines, said that although he was impressed with the
video input technology, he was uncertain how far and fast it would
be adopted by the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to tell,'' Faggin said, noting that people would
probably use a combination of methods to interact with computers.
``We are at the beginning of a process. How the creativity of the
software people will manifest itself with this new paradigm still
remains largely to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Engineers have designed programs that can use recent
improvements in the processing power of home PCs to interpret
signals from high-speed computer-mounted video cameras. The
player's image is tracked as the video camera picks up its
movement, like the outline of a hand as it moves from frame to
frame at no less than 30 frames per second. The programs analyze
what the camera sees when it is pointed at a person. The program
segments the image by trying to remove everything in the scene that
does not belong to the player's image. Computer engineers say that
this allows the program to superimpose the player's moving image _
and not the wall behind the player _ into the game environment.
</P>
<P>
   When the moving outlines come in contact with the outlines of
game elements in the computer, like the roundness of a virtual
basketball, the program instructs the game to respond
appropriately. This enables a player to move his or her hand to tap
a basketball that exists only on the computer screen and then see a
video image of that hand tap the ball into a virtual basket.
</P>
<P>
   The current applications are hardly perfect. The images are
sometimes ghostly, and players can sometimes discover themselves
pushing their fingers right through virtual buttons.
</P>
<P>
   Albert suggests that video as input could replace keyboards,
joysticks, track balls and pads, touch screens like those on
automated teller machines and even the ubiquitous mouse. Others
venture further, saying that more advanced examples of the
technology could enable future generations of voice-activated
computers to read facial expressions and body language better.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Callan, vice president for marketing at Reality Fusion, said
that the technology could help create more intuitive and
interactive computers like the fictional Hal 2000 computer in the
film ``2001'' _ but without the murderous malfunctions. The
company, which was founded in 1997 and is based in Santa Cruz,
Calif., is preparing to release a kit for developers that will make
it easier for other companies to use Reality Fusion's game
technology for new applications.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't intend to grow as a stand-alone, skrink-wrapped
product,'' Callan said. ``We intend to build a platform from which
others can develop their products that can be used in other walks
of life.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, gaming is the platform that Intel Play and
Reality Fusion are turning to in the hope of winning converts to
the new technology. Because the new games do not require
traditional input devices _ except for the lengthy installation and
a few mouse clicks to get started _ the learning curve for young
children is very short. ``For a small child, it magically
transports him into a whole new world,'' Bogar said.
</P>
<P>
   Once a player's moving image has been inserted into the Me2Cam
game world, everything the video image does mirrors what the player
actually does. To burst a soap bubble on a computer screen, for
example, a person can just reach into the air and a virtual finger,
guided by the real one, pokes a computer-rendered bubble and makes
it pop.
</P>
<P>
   A bit more demanding is the Snow Surfin' game, which places
players in oversize ski boots bolted to a snowboard in a colorful
cartoon setting. The goal is to snowboard as fast as possible down
a slope strewn with obstacles like trees, rocks, skiing polar bears
and tottering seals _ lots of sound included.
</P>
<P>
   To control the board, players have only to shift their weight
from left to right. The game's camera rapidly translates the
players' head movements into instructions that the program uses to
move the snowboard left or right.
</P>
<P>
   Some players said that the action was real enough to make them
perspire.
</P>
<P>
   Silver of InfoTrends said that the technology was still very
new. ``I'm not sure how long it will take,'' he said, ``for a
technology like this to unseat something as prevalent as a mouse,
but once people see how obviously easy it is, it could change old
behaviors.''
</P>
<P>
   The virtual ball, he said, is in the developers' court.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   A large portion of the contiguous states will be bereft of
precipitation Thursday. One exception will be the Great Lakes
region, where snow showers will develop in concert with a weak
disturbance moving eastward. Most of the snow showers will occur in
the wake of a cold front associated with the disturbance as
increasingly cold air behind the front, which marks the core of an
arctic air mass, is moistened in transit over relatively warm
waters.
</P>
<P>
   Though some snow showers and flurries will also develop over the
northern Appalachians, only broken areas of high cirrus and
mid-level altostratus clouds will stream east of the Appalachians,
arriving during the day over the Northeast Seaboard. Nonetheless,
precipitation is unlikely along the New England and northern Middle
Atlantic seaboards.
</P>
<P>
   Spotty showers will develop over parts of southern Florida as a
slow-moving cool front interacts with a channel of moisture
streaming northeast from the southern Gulf of Mexico and the
western Caribbean. Farther west, a pall of low clouds will again
shroud the Rio Grande Valley of Texas, producing patchy drizzle and
sporadic, light showers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the rest of the region from the Rockies to the
Pacific Ocean will be decidedly dry as a behemoth warm ridge of
high pressure reigns over the region from several thousand feet
above the ground. Moreover, almost the entire region will be sunny,
save for areas of fog and low clouds that form early in the Pacific
Northwest and only gradually shrink and dissipate during the day. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: December Warmth
</P>
<P>
   The mercury soared to 84 degrees at Shelter Cove, Calif., on
Monday, breaking the town's all-time December high. Though pockets
of record warmth were observed in northern California, cities such
as Sacramento recorded temperatures that could only be described as
seasonably warm. The weather pattern was marked by warm high
pressure several thousand feet over northern California. In many
cases, a temperature inversion aloft impeded warm air from mixing
to the ground. At Shelter Cove, winds descending the mountains to
the east helped to bring warmth to the surface.

FROM `ULYSSES' TO `ON THE ROAD'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDITOR'S NOTE: Until year's end, the Star-Telegram brings you a
subjective look at the top 10 moments of the century in the arts.
Today: Books
</P>
<P>
   1922: James Joyce's dense novel ``Ulysses'' is published in
Paris. It's banned in the United States until 1933 because of
language and one especially erotic scene, but no matter. Joyce has
set a new standard for the modern American novel, and the rule is:
There are no longer any rules.
</P>
<P>
   1952: Ralph Ellison's ``Invisible Man,'' the saga of a
deliberately unnamed black protagonist searching for some basis of
self-identity, establishes that black authors can write classics
that educate as well as entertain.
</P>
<P>
   1936: Margaret Mitchell publishes ``Gone With the Wind,'' which
remains America's favorite novel written in, if not concerning, the
20th century.
</P>
<P>
   1942: The first weekly bestseller list appears in ``The New York
Times Book Review.'' Previously, only intermittent lists from
limited sources were printed. Publishers begin to base their
marketing decisions on how books fare on weekly lists instead of
promoting titles because they are well-written.
</P>
<P>
   1925: Sinclair Lewis refuses the Pulitzer Prize for his novel
``Arrowsmith,'' taking exception to the competition's tradition of
honoring books depicting ``the wholesome atmosphere of American
life.'' In response, the Pulitzer Committee announces that it will,
in the future, select ``distinguished fiction by an American
author, preferably dealing with American life.''
</P>
<P>
   1962: Theodore White's ``The Making of the President 1960''
serves as an instant primer for future presidential campaigns.
Political organizers in other states, reading about the influence
of primary elections in New Hampshire, West Virginia and Wisconsin,
hurry to organize their own primaries. The American political
system is changed forever by this book.
</P>
<P>
   1936: Dale Carnegie's ``How to Win Friends and Influence
People'' is perhaps the first bestselling ``self-help'' book; by
century's end, self-help books will dominate the publishing
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   1917: John Reed's ``Ten Days That Shook the World,'' a
sympathetic chronicle of the 1917 Russian revolution, creates
instant controversy. Reed, eventually indicted on a sedition
charge, flees the United States for Russia and dies in 1920.
</P>
<P>
   1926: The Book-of-the-Month Club and the Literary Guild are
founded. Americans unable or unwilling to go to bookstores now have
easy mail access to many titles.
</P>
<P>
   1957: Jack Kerouac's ``On the Road'' unleashes a flood of
novels, essays and poems from ``The Beat Generation''
(Ferlinghetti, Ginsberg, et al). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HONORABLE MENTION: The publication of J.D. Salinger's ``The
Catcher in the Rye'' in 1951; it's impossible to estimate how many
American teen-agers subsequently read and are greatly affected by
this novel; 1987, when Tom Wolfe's ``The Bonfire of the Vanities''
perfectly captures American's money-and-status-obsessed society and
is, perhaps, the final great American novel of the century.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ George Mitchell, the former U.S. senator who recently
forged an unexpected alliance between Ulster's unionists and
republicans, had a hand this year in bringing ceremonial closure to
another feud, this time between Ireland's conservative
establishment and its favorite hate object, the writer Edna
O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   On behalf of Queens University in Belfast, Mitchell awarded Ms.
O'Brien a doctorate, saying in his presentation that she had
``changed the course of Irish womanhood.'' That was a far cry from
``a smear on Irish womanhood,'' the words used by a government
censor in 1960 when Ireland banned ``The Country Girls,'' Ms.
O'Brien's first novel. The censors banned her next six books as
well amid fusillades of vituperation that only increased her fame.
After James Joyce she is the best-known banned Irish writer of the
century.
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. O'Brien talks to a visitor in the small, red-walled
drawing room of her Victorian house in the Chelsea section of
London, one sees that much of her renowned beauty is still intact.
The famous auburn hair is now shorter and less wild. The
expressions that change like clouds rumple her pale skin in the
usual places, but her face retains the imperious precision of fine
carving.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion for this conversation was the opening of her first
play in 12 years, ``Our Father,'' for a limited run at the Almeida
Theater. Ms. O'Brien was in the hand-wringing stage known well by
playwrights. The play has since opened to reviews ranging from
raves to pans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a nervous creature,'' she said in her low voice, with its
lilting County Clare accent. ``So nervous that I don't know how I
get up and down the street or cook dinner because I'm always on the
edge.'' She had been up most of the previous night writing notes on
the production, she said. But working around the clock is her usual
pattern.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm writing, the job of doing it assails me night and
day,'' she said. ``I get up in the night. I rewrite the way
Penelope ripped that bloody tapestry in Homer all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Her obsessiveness has created a hefty body of work: 14 novels
(her latest, ``Wild Decembers,'' will be published in the United
States in the spring), five volumes of short stories, four plays,
plus movie and television scripts, essays, a nonfiction book about
Ireland and a new biography of Joyce, just published in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Father'' is, in the words of Jonathan Kent, the
co-artistic director of the Almeida, ``full of hidden terrors,
hidden dangers and secrets held in the dark,'' a description that
could apply to virtually all her work. In the play four grown
siblings return to their failing farm in western Ireland to
celebrate the wedding anniversary of their pious mother and brutish
father, whom The Guardian's reviewer called ``the least lovable
father since King Lear.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the details in ``Our Father'' have been seen before in
various incarnations throughout her work, interwoven each time with
new material and revealing a different facet of the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``An artist keeps going back to very wounded moments,'' she
said. ``Sometimes you're not aware of it, but they crop up of their
own accord, because childhood and that absolute seepage of
geography, language, death and pain has gone into you. It's as
organic as anything else. But if you write something about marriage
or loss or childhood, fathers, mothers, the whole stew, it's never
a catharsis. It glues you more to them. I get the food that I am
unable to get from human intercourse.''
</P>
<P>
   That would come as a surprise to her public. The Irish writer
Colm Toibin said recently in The Observer, ``The name Edna O'Brien
is associated with sex,'' and Vanity Fair once called her ``the
playgirl of the Western world.''
</P>
<P>
   But these days the social butterfly label is inaccurate. She
spends most of her time writing in isolation, either in Ireland or
London, where she moved permanently as a teen-ager in the late
1950s when she eloped with the Czech novelist Ernest Gebler. Her
scandalized parents gave chase. That was the beginning, even before
her writing, of her troubles over things sexual.
</P>
<P>
   ``Erotic love springs from such a deep source within me that it
is like some of the elements of childhood, that trepidation and
longing,'' Ms. O'Brien said. She wore a calf-length brown velvet
skirt and a low-cut black sweater. ``The longing is for a unity
that is permanent, and life and people aren't permanent. So as we
go into the very swim of it, we are afraid that it will not last.
And that brings fear and loss even before the loss. Then there's
the destruction Ted Hughes talks about in a poem: lovers devouring
each other. Our hungers, which are always there waiting to be
unleashed, can get the better of us and frighten another person.''
</P>
<P>
   She whispered this last phrase, as she did her most emotional
declarations. ``But I wouldn't for the world regret having loved,
regardless of the final act.''
</P>
<P>
   Since her divorce in 1968 from Gebler, who died in 1998, she has
lived alone. She maintains that loneliness is necessary for a
writer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one was fairly content, why in the name of God would one
want to go through the discipline and scariness of sitting down to
write 90,000 words?'' she asked. ``And one thing is the other.
Writing makes you lonely because you have to exile yourself. But
deeper than that is an inborn native loneliness, a spiritual void
that words, for some reason, help fill.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``I would say that every writer I have admired, like
Faulkner, whom I love, and Joyce, or Emily Bronte, Sylvia Plath,
Chekhov, Beckett, regardless of their particular daily history, has
a loneliness and a depth of feeling that cannot be corresponded to,
and that's why they write.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Her Joyce book is part of a new series of short biographies,
Viking Lives. British critical response to her vision of Joyce was
mostly favorable but scathing about factual inaccuracies, which
have been corrected for the American edition.
</P>
<P>
   Like Joyce, Edna O'Brien has been under attack all her life. She
said she remembered her shock and pain when her parish priest held
a ``little burning on the chapel grounds'' of her first novel.
After her mother died, Ms. O'Brien said, she found her book wrapped
in a sheet in an outhouse. Her mother had ``gone through it with
black ink, the ink of Hades as I called it, and crossed, erased,
any word that offended her. I both wept and screamed.''
</P>
<P>
   She sees the comedy in it now, just barely, she said, raising
one arched eyebrow like a storybook bad queen. ``There is a hidden
criminality in writing. While you're doing it, it is your secret.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides disapprobation, there are other similarities between
Joyce's life and hers. While they were children, both their
families were listed in the debtors magazine, Stubbs Gazette,
causing a lifelong memory of shame. And both writers became
expatriates, along with O'Casey, Beckett and Wilde. As a character
in her novel ``Time and Tide'' says, you have to be far away for
``that enchantment that distance bestows.''
</P>
<P>
   What did she learn from Joyce?
</P>
<P>
   ``Here was a man who had written `Ulysses,' who, for 17 years,
every day and sometimes night, with his eyesight almost gone and
having to feel words and use color pencils and crayons, went into
the Hades and the paradise of his mind and his imagination to write
`Finnegans Wake,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned what I already knew. No outside hostility,
criticism, adulation or anything else must detract or deter the
writer from doing the thing they have to do.''`

LIFE THROWS MORRIS LAPIDUS A FEW GOOD CURVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOSEPH GIOVANNINI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ In the early 1990s, after his wife's death, the
legendary architect Morris Lapidus found himself staring at a
calendar white with blank dates. The designer of Miami's
Fontainebleau and Eden Roc hotels, Lapidus, then in his early 90s,
had retired from active practice and was sitting alone in his
ocean-front duplex, bored.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, after serving on a review panel for work by Miami
architecture students, he had lunch with a fellow juror, Deborah
Desilets, and more lunches. ``He was so removed from professional
life,'' she said. ``I realized that he had so much to give that it
would be a shame not to find some way to make it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually they formed an informal partnership, taking him from
deep retirement to shallow retirement. Now, at 97, he is back in
business, sketching.
</P>
<P>
   With Ms. Desilets, 41, he has conceived a new hotel for Miami
Beach, which is awaiting financing, and several stores for Roots, a
Canadian clothing chain. On Wednesday, their new project, Aura, a
restaurant, opened on Lincoln Road in the Art Deco district.
Sitting in the immutable apartment he designed here many years ago,
Lapidus said with the groomed voice of a gentleman from the old
school, ``After I met Deborah, things got interesting again.''
</P>
<P>
   Before he was America's pre-eminent hotel designer, he was the
country's pre-eminent store architect. He has shaped the restaurant
to entice customers inside. ``I hate the box, so all of my stores
have undulating curves and lines,'' he said. ``The curves get
almost psychedelic.''
</P>
<P>
   The curves sweep people into a bath of red, orange, pink and
aqua. Lapidus has used his signature free-form shapes to conceal
lights throughout the restaurant, which has 1,900 square feet and
60 seats. Aura is named after the glow.
</P>
<P>
   He is quick to credit his collaborator, Ms. Desilets, an
architect, who develops his preliminary designs. ``Some people keep
wondering what this old man is doing with this young woman,'' he
said. ``She makes the work possible. She's an excellent
draftswoman. The details of architecture don't interest me anymore.
I depend on her. She edits me. I want to design, but that's all I
want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   With her assistance, Lapidus began lecturing across the country.
The lectures in turn led to the first of the new commissions. ``Mr.
Lapidus knows how to give emotions physical form,'' she said. ``His
space swirls you; it prompts you to move; it's an interactive
architecture.''
</P>
<P>
   As in his hotel designs, there's hardly a straight line in the
restaurant plan. Many people see only the decoration in Lapidus'
work and are unable to appreciate the brilliant complexity of the
plan. ``A lot of interlocking forms, one curve moving in and
another swinging out in the opposite way,'' he said. ``People don't
move in straight lines like an army _ they meander. So, my plans
meander. At the Fontainebleau, I used everything. Normally, an
architect would do plans, and the drapes would be done by somebody
else. I wanted to do it all, and I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Aghast at the dripping chandeliers and swag curtains, critics
bashed the Fontaine-bleau and his other hotels. ``The International
style had taken over,'' he said. He recalls what Serge Chermayeff,
a Yale professor and a consultant to the Museum of Modern Art in
New York, once said, ``You can like Lapidus' work, if you're
blind.''
</P>
<P>
   But others didn't rush to judgment. ``Philip Johnson said years
ago that he'd like to wait and see,'' Lapidus said. ``When we had
lunch about three months ago in New York, he embraced me and said,
`You're the father of us all.' It's a very pleasant memory.''
</P>
<P>
   Lapidus, who trained at Columbia when Beaux-Arts decoration was
integral to the curriculum, straddled traditional and Modernist
architecture. When critics ostracized him, he was deeply hurt. The
bitter architect sent truckloads of drawings to the incinerators
when he closed his office in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Lapidus was an intuitive designer doing emotive
architecture at a time when architecture required a reason for
everything,'' Ms. Desilets said. ``The architectural fishbowl was
too small for him to breathe in.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Lapidus enjoys the pulpit. ``I've been rediscovered,'' he
said. ``And the attention I'm getting, it's very pleasant, as if
people never knew me. At first I defended myself, but now I
don't.'' He believes that his kind of architecture appeals to
people, and has always appealed.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he will work with only Ms. Desilets. ``The only enjoyment
I have now is my lecturing and the chance to do some designing with
Deborah,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Desilets said, ``Once we realized that the mind has no age,
we've had a raving good time.''

   Mercedes and Motorola Revive Idea of Car Phone &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In their early days cell phones came in two models: bulky units
that were intended to stay in cars and slightly less bulky versions
that were ostensibly for handheld use. Now Motorola and
Mercedes-Benz USA have revived the idea of the car-specific cell
phone although thankfully without the heft.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Patrone, manager of advanced products for Mercedes-Benz
US., said the company concluded that current handheld phones were
not suited to the highway. ``The small controls, the small display
you need in a light, portable phone are not the things you want in
a car,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of sporting Mercedes' star logo, the Mercedes Motorola
StarTAC digital and analog cell phone looks like a regular tiny,
handheld set. But once the phone is slipped into a cradle in a 2000
model year Mercedes, special software integrates it with the car's
electronics systems.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, drivers can operate the phone using controls
on the steering wheel or dashboard while viewing information, such
as stored numbers, on a dashboard display. The system automatically
lowers the radio or CD volume during calls, and the car's radio
speakers and built-in microphone can be used for hands-free
calling. An additional option allows users to place calls with
voice commands.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are talking longer in the car as cellular rates come
down,'' said Marios Zenios, general manager of the Motorola
Telematics Communications Group. ``We're starting to see
legislation appear in this country that will require hands-free
operation.''
</P>
<P>
   The special phone and integration hardware is standard on
Mercedes' top of the line 12-cylinder models. In other Mercedeses,
the phone system costs $1,295, plus $480 for voice recognition.
However, Zenios said Motorola was developing similar systems with a
variety of automakers. ``You're going to start seeing it in lower
and lower tiers of cars,'' he said.

   New Yule Log Tradition Glows With Eerie Light &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Back in the electronic Dark Ages _ say, a decade ago or so _
many an apartment-dwelling New Yorker celebrated Christmas by
getting friends and family together, setting them up with mugs of
holiday cheer, and gathering around the television set. On the
screen, broadcast by WPIX, a local station, was a continuous-loop
tape of a yule log burning in a fireplace, accompanied by holiday
music.
</P>
<P>
   It's a measure of how much technology has improved life that
now, in the Internet Age, hearthless people everywhere can have a
virtual fire in their homes. And no longer must they rely on the
TV; now they can huddle around ... the computer.
</P>
<P>
   WPIX's original Yule Log tape is available on the Internet, at
www.wb11/yulelog.htm. It was shot in 1966 at Gracie Mansion when
Mayor John Lindsay lived there, and was last broadcast in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The presentation has been updated: now, instead of the one
soundtrack, viewers have a choice of several. And images of the
roaring fire can be saved for use as a screen saver, or printed out
to be sent to friends who don't have a fireplace _ or a computer.

   Microsoft Unveils Tax Product, but Bill Gates Can't Use It &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What do you give a man with everything? Why, tax software, of
course. Microsoft's TaxSaver software started arriving in stores
this week, joining a crowded tax software market dominated by
Intuit's TurboTax product line. Microsoft joined with the
accounting giant Arthur Andersen to produce the package.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft has been talking about a tax product for years,''
said Laura Starita, an analyst at the Gartner Group, ``but it's
extremely cumbersome and not a fun business to be in.''
</P>
<P>
   The product is tightly linked to Microsoft's personal finance
manager, Money, and includes a three-month subscription to the
company's online network, MSN, and its financial portal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about the software as much as it's about how it plays
to the Web and vertical portal offerings. Microsoft is constructing
ways to bring customers to them. That's an important element for
Microsoft over time,'' Ms. Starita said.
</P>
<P>
   The standard version costs $14.95, jumping to $39.95 for the
deluxe version, which includes additional help features,
tax-related videos and free electronic filing. Billionaires, take
note: TaxSaver will take only nine digits in the dollar field for
wages, tips and other compensation. Day traders can take heart,
though. That field will accept negative numbers. &QL;

   &UR; Getting Rarer &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Growing up in southern Connecticut, we could find trailing
pine (fan-shaped branches on a runner) and princess pine (which
resembles three-inch evergreen seedlings) in the woods each winter.
I haven't seen either of these in the New York woods. Can they be
purchased and introduced into my woodsy property in Putnam County?
</P>
<P>
   A. Both princess pine (Lycopodium obscurum) and trailing pine
(L. digitatum) are two of the few remaining species of club mosses,
plants that have been around since the time that coal was first
being formed, about 300 million years ago. Unfortunately, we may
yet see them disappear altogether, since they are so appealing in
Christmas wreaths and garlands.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't surprising that you haven't seen them in the woods
recently. Both are listed as ``exploitably vulnerable'' on the New
York State Protected Native Plants List _ that is, they are likely
to become threatened if harvesting from the wild continues. They
are not currently on the protected lists in New Jersey or
Connecticut, but it is probably just a matter of time before
they're added.
</P>
<P>
   They are both difficult to cultivate and slow growing. Trailing
pine, like most other Lycopodium species, forms a complex
relationship with a fungus that lives among its roots and
contributes to its nutrition. It is almost impossible to transplant
trailing pine without destroying the relationship, so it can't be
grown commercially. Princess pine doesn't have this relationship,
but it is also very fussy about its growing conditions, so it's not
likely that you will find it in a catalog.
</P>
<P>
   Every garland or wreath you see made of these two ancient
survivors represents about 25 years' growth of plants taken from
the wild. They have survived dinosaurs, ice ages and upheavals of
all sorts. If you ask me, it seems a shame to use them in Christmas
decorations that are thrown out after a week or two.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; No Magic Potions &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. We will soon move into a new house, and I have a problem with
the landscaping. I'm 65, and I don't want to pay for large plants
or wait 20 years for small plants to mature. Gibberellic acid, the
plant growth hormone, is available from a mail-order nursery that
also sells small, inexpensive trees and shrubs. Would that hormone
be the answer to my problem?  &QL; 
A. Sounds logical, and you probably wouldn't be the first person to
be disappointed, but it isn't a magic potion.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter Davies, an expert in plant hormones at Cornell
University, said gibberellins are plant hormones that occur
naturally and help control growth. Gibberellic (pronounced
jib-er-EL-ic) acid makes some plants grow taller, but it does so by
an unnatural elongation of the cells, not the production of healthy
new tissue. While there has been no research into its effect on
trees, he expects that it would not work at all.
</P>
<P>
   Gibberellins do have uses in horticulture, including in the
testing of dormant seeds to see if they are still viable, but
instant landscaping isn't one of them. Buy medium-size, well-grown
plants you can enjoy watching grow, and let the future take care of
itself.

 &HT;    Black vendor cite Super Bowl freeze-out
 &HT;    By Ernie Suggs
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ By the time Super Bowl XXXIV rolls around on Jan. 30,
dozens of black-owned Atlanta businesses will have reaped millions
of dollars from minority-based incentive programs.
</P>
<P>
   But Steven Muhammad, a black Atlanta businessman for 20 years,
is afraid he won't see a dime of that. Neither will the 100 or so
members of the Black Vendors Association, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad, secretary of the BVA, claims that the NFL and the
Super Bowl have purposely excluded vendors who have traditionally
set up shop in parking lots around the Georgia Dome. He said all of
the private parking lots usually reserved for vendors to sell
souvenirs and T-shirts have been snatched up by the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``They cut us out of the loop of Super Bowl financing,''
Muhammad said. ``They want to sell everything themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   But Carlos James, vice president for community relations and
opportunities for the Metro Atlanta Super Bowl XXXIV Host
Committee, said any limitation in available vendor space is based
on a need for parking spaces, not some desire to push black vendors
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fully support the city of Atlanta's laws involving street
vending,'' James said. ``We are not going to displace them or ask
them to move. It will be business as usual for them during the
Super Bowl. We have said that over and over.''
</P>
<P>
   James said the main problem revolves around new construction at
the Georgia World Congress Center that must be completed in time
for the International Woodworkers Show in the summer of 2002.
</P>
<P>
   As of right now, that project will take away more than 2,000
prime parking spaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are losing 2,000 parking spaces so we had to go out and
purchase private lots to accommodate people,'' James said. ``The
bid says we must provide parking spaces.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike an ordinary Sunday afternoon Falcons game, Super Bowl
Sunday will be a totally different animal, especially when it comes
to parking. James estimates that aside from the hundreds of media
trucks and vans, there will be 1,100 buses and 800 limousines
fighting for space around the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you lose 2,000 spaces you have to make up for it,'' said
James, adding that dozens of minority and women will benefit from
contracts designed specifically for them. ``We have taken the high
road on this. It is our intent to make this a more inclusive Super
Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad said not being able to operate in those lots will ruin
business opportunities for some of his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is going to hurt us bad financially,'' Muhammad said. ``We
have made deals with some of the merchandise vendors to buy a lot
of merchandise.''
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad tried to stress that point Wednesday when he and about
20 other vendors visited to Host Committee offices to voice their
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked to them, but we really didn't get any answers. We
got the run around,'' Muhammad said. ``But this is not over. We are
going to hit the streets next week and turn up the heat.''

THE POP LIFE: THE HILLS AND DELTA FLOW IN THEIR BLOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDEPENDENCE, Miss. _ A wrestling match flickered on the screen
in the trailer home of Jim Dickinson, the renegade Memphis producer
and musician, and his wife, Mary Lindsay. His son, Luther, sat
slumped in an armchair.
</P>
<P>
   Once a full-fledged punk-rocker, Luther Dickinson has spent
recent years immersed in the Mississippi hill country blues and
roots-music scene surrounding his home. At 26, he is among the best
guitarists of his generation, having plunged into the deep well of
knowledge shared by his neighbors. These include the bluesmen R.L.
Burnside and Junior Kimbrough (who died in 1998) and the
92-year-old fife-and-drum musician Othar Turner, one of the oldest
living links to the roots of American music. In addition to leading
the powerful blues-jam band the North Mississippi All-Stars with
his 23-year-old brother, Cody, Luther has also been producing new
recordings by local legends like Turner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me so happy to see him participating in this North
Mississippi music scene,'' Jim Dickinson said of Luther. ``I never
thought I'd see him playing _ for want of a better word _ roots
music.''
</P>
<P>
   Luther protested: ``But you knew something would happen. You
moved us here.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother shook her head. ``No,'' she said. ``You and your
brother said that you were tired of going to school with white
people. That's why we moved here.'' (The boys, who are white
themselves, used to attend a private school east of Memphis.)
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my most important relationships,'' Jim Dickinson said,
``was with an older black man, who taught me everything. But I
didn't think that the relationship of an old black man and a young
white boy was still possible today. And now Luther is in one, and
with a monster of a human being like Othar.'' Dickinson continued,
discussing watching his son play guitar as Turner corrected him and
taught him to value feeling over technique.
</P>
<P>
   In a time when Americans in their 20s are so connected to the
rest of the world by cable and the Internet, it is rare to find a
young band like the Mississippi All-Stars with such a strong sense
of the region they come from. No group in any other part of the
country could make the music the Mississippi All-Stars do because
their roots run so deep into the hill country and Delta around
them, the music of Fred McDowell and R.L. Burnside, whose sons and
grandsons the band often collaborates with.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would never move out of here,'' Luther Dickinson said. ``If
we became successful, it would be our responsibility to bring that
success here. In fact, we want to open up our own juke joint in
Memphis. We're going to do it: us and R.L. Burnside's sons. That's
our New Year's ambition.''
</P>
<P>
   Luther left his parents' trailer and met his brother in a shack
surrounded by barbed wire on the back of their property. This was
their studio and, in keeping with their sense of tradition, its
walls were lined with asbestos squares of soundproofing, not unlike
in the old Sun Studio in Memphis. This was a band that valued
authenticity over health.
</P>
<P>
   Luther and Cody Dickinson talked music nonstop. They discussed
the musical keys favored by local musicians, the evolution of
lyrics as they traveled from the Delta to hill country, the
differences between the live and recorded work of long-dead
bluesmen and why Rage Against the Machine is a far better band than
Limp Bizkit.
</P>
<P>
   Far from purists, the Mississippi All-Stars have worked up their
own dense hybrid boogie incorporating the riff-heavy and
hard-hitting elements of hill country blues. At a recent concert at
the Cave in Chapel Hill, N.C., the band played for three hours,
stringing together traditional blues songs into long solo-packed
jams. Cody Dickinson played skittering drum solos that verged on
free jazz while Luther Dickinson had a huge arsenal of techniques.
No two guitar tricks were the same: one minute he was using the
alternating thumb style of Mississippi John Hurt and the next he
was hammering the fretboard with a limp-wristed hand to produce a
chugging rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   The band was reminiscent of the power blues of '60s rock acts
like Cream, Steppenwolf and Jimi Hendrix, but had the postmodern
electricity of the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion and the exploratory
lust of jam bands like Phish and Widespread Panic. The band
recently signed to Tone-Cool Records in Boston and will release its
first CD in the spring. But already it has put out independent
cassettes and a single, toured with Medeski, Martin and Wood, and
remixed songs for the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion. The brothers'
side project, an up-tempo jug band called Gutbucket, toured with
the Squirrel Nut Zippers.
</P>
<P>
   Though their father initially tried to steer his sons clear of
music, their fate was sealed early on. Before he could even speak,
Luther would spend hours enthralled as he watched the tape running
through his father's reel-to-reel machines. ``I was in my dad's
studio one day hanging out, and my mom scooped me up to carry me
back to the house. He had a huge old Ampex eight-track machine, and
I pointed to that and said, `Studiolioliolio.' And that was my
first word,  &UR; studio, &LR;  before mama or anything.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Luther was in third-grade, he says, he had formed a
band, the Rebelaires, with his younger brother. They performed two
shows playing Elvis Presley, Carl Perkins and Bo Diddley songs. As
teen-agers, they grew up influenced by their father's groups
(particularly Mud Boy and the Neutrons) and hung out in his studio
recording as sidemen with the Replacements, Mojo Nixon and Billy
Lee Riley. Soon they had their own bands, like Pigs in Space and
D.D.T., before they settled on blues boogie with the North
Mississippi All-Stars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   As the sun set, Luther and Cody Dickinson left the studio and
piled with friends into their van. It was Sunday night, time to
make their weekly pilgrimage to Junior Kimbrough's Juke Joint, a
ramshackle club in nearby Holly Springs, perhaps the best-known
juke joint in the South.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists often trek there in hopes of finding a venerable
bluesman in his element performing for locals. But on this night
any tourist would have been in for a shock. The scene was the exact
opposite of that at Manhattan blues shows, which tend to involve a
bunch of white folks' watching a black man onstage. Here, the black
locals were dancing and drinking as a couple of white musicians sat
onstage, the North Mississippi All-Stars. Luther and Cody revved up
songs by R.L. Burnside, joined by Burnside's son Garry on bass and
grandson Cedric on drums. Though some tourists may have been
disappointed because they were looking for something more
authentic, they were wrong: This was authentic North Mississippi
hill country music at the turn of the century, handed down across
generations and played less with tradition in mind than keeping the
crowd on the dance floor.

FROM CARUSO TO NIRVANA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDITOR'S NOTE: Till year's end, the ``Star-Telegram'' brings you
a subjective look at the top 10 moments of the century in the arts.
Today: Music.
</P>
<P>
   1904: Two-sided discs are put on sale by Columbia. This will
soon lead to the success of performers such as Enrico Caruso, whose
popularity begins the craze of buying music and having it in the
home.
</P>
<P>
   1923-1927: Bessie Smith and Jimmie Rodgers make their debuts,
and Duke Ellington records the first of several theme songs, ``East
St. Louis Toodle-oo.'' Smith becomes the first blues superstar,
Rodgers becomes the first real country star with his fusion of
folk, blues, pop and Dixieland, and Ellington's legacy as one of
America's great bandleaders and composers begins in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   1945: Charlie Parker records as a bandleader for the first time,
with Miles Davis on trumpet. Parker will become the first name in
bebop and cut numerous jazz standards _ ``KoKo, Cherokee, Now's the
Time'' and more _ before dying in 1955 at age 35.
</P>
<P>
   1948: Muddy Waters records his first singles for Chicago's Chess
Records. By electrifying the sounds of Delta blues, Waters makes
songs such as ``Rollin' Stone'' and ``I Can't Be Satisfied'' that
will set the standard for Chicago blues and lead directly to the
British blues-rock explosion.
</P>
<P>
   1955-1957: The golden era of rock 'n' roll, with hits by Elvis
Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Chuck Berry, Carl Perkins, Little Richard
and many more. Propelled by the national premiere of ``American
Bandstand,'' rock 'n' roll explodes from coast to coast and on into
Europe. At the same time, Frank Sinatra will release several of his
all-time classics, including ``In the Wee Small Hours'' and ``A
Swingin' Affair!''
</P>
<P>
   1963-1969: Arguably the most important era in rock history,
these six years will see the full flowering of Motown and Southern
soul via acts such as Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, Aretha
Franklin, and Otis Redding; debuts by Jimi Hendrix, Bob Seger, the
Band, Simon &AMP; Garfunkel, the Grateful Dead, Van Morrison, Pink
Floyd, the Velvet Underground, Fairport Convention, Santana, the
Allman Brothers and Cream; the release of the greatest live record
ever (James Brown's ``Live at the Apollo);'' the birth of art-rock
with debuts by Jethro Tull and King Crimson; the best work by Bob
Dylan and the Rolling Stones; the folk-blues boom; ALL of the
Beatles' essential recordings; Dylan ``going electric;'' Woodstock;
Altamont; and the birth of punk and heavy metal via the '69 debut
LPs by the Stooges and the MC5.
</P>
<P>
   1972-1974: The '70s have been lambasted as a lame decade for
music, but these three years would prove to be extremely important
to rock 'n' roll. Bruce Springsteen, the Eagles, Queen, Lynyrd
Skynyrd, Aerosmith and Roxy Music all released their debuts, Bob
Marley's classic first two albums _ ``Catch a Fire'' and
``Burnin''' _ came out, and glam rock caught fire via David Bowie's
``The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars''
and ``Diamond Dogs,'' Mott the Hoople's ``All the Young Dudes'' and
``Mott,'' and the New York Dolls' two albums.
</P>
<P>
   1977-1980: Punk/New Wave/alternative/whatever kicks to life with
classic recordings by the Sex Pistols, U2, the Clash, the Ramones,
Patti Smith, X, Motorhead, Joy Division, Blondie, XTC, Talking
Heads, Television, the Buzzcocks, the Damned, Elvis Costello and
many more.
</P>
<P>
   1986-1988: Rap's initial explosion in the marketplace via such
records as the Beastie Boys' debut, ``Licensed to Ill,'' Public
Enemy's debut, ``Yo! Bum Rush the Show,'' and Run-D.M.C.'s classic
``Raising Hell.''
</P>
<P>
   1990-1992: The last great years of change in rock music, with
debuts by Nirvana and Pearl Jam forever changing what is popular
hard rock; at the same time, R.E.M. and U2 would reassert
themselves with CDs as good as anything they cut in the '80s, maybe
better.

A RESURGENCE OF BLACKSMITHING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Tenn., Ga., Mo., Wash.)   (Circuits)  
 (af)  
 By MICHAEL POLLAK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To understand blacksmithing's current appeal, forget about Henry
Wadsworth Longfellow's village smithy under the spreading chestnut
tree with his arms like iron bands. Instead, suggests Brian
Gilbert, consider the lowly kitchen spatula. Everybody has one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have one, too,'' Gilbert of Chattanooga, Tenn., wrote by
e-mail, ``except mine is handmade, and if you take the time to
notice, has decorative touches that make it really nice to hold.
It's a pretty piece, there's not another exactly like it anywhere
else in the world, and I'm proud of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert is editor of The Hammer's Blow, one of two publications
of Abana, the Artist-Blacksmith's Association of North America,
which was founded in 1973 in Lumpkin, Ga., by 20 blacksmiths
attending a convention. Ten years later, membership was 2,250, and
today, it is 4,500, with more than 300 joining each year, according
to Abana's Web site, www.abana.org/index.html.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 50 Abana chapters, including chapters in
Australia and New Zealand and some on university campuses where
decorative arts and metalworking are taken seriously. On the site,
one can subscribe to Abana's two newsletters, The Hammer's Blow,
with many how-to hints, and The Anvil's Ring, which showcases new
creations. There is also an online store.
</P>
<P>
   Blacksmithing is most often associated with shoeing horses, an
association not all blacksmiths care for, said Jim McCarty, who
edits The Anvil's Ring. ``I know many blacksmiths who would not
like to admit this,'' McCarty of Taos, Mo., wrote by e-mail. ``They
wear pins with a horseshoe covered by the `Ghostbusters' symbol as
a sign of disdain for the mere shoer of horses. The fact is had
they not continued their trade, blacksmithing would have died.''
</P>
<P>
   Farriers, blacksmiths who specialize in shoeing horses, kept the
old traditions alive, McCarty said. ``The farrier saved
blacksmithing,'' he wrote. ``While the need for blacksmiths to make
tools, repair farm equipment and forge household items ended around
World War II, there has never been a time when the services of the
farrier were no longer needed.''
</P>
<P>
   A second reason for the resurgence of blacksmithing, he wrote,
was the efforts of the Sixties generation to rediscover lost arts.
And there were revered teachers like the late Francis Whitaker, who
died in October at age 92 and whose contributions are outlined in a
special page in Abana.
</P>
<P>
   You are not going to learn blacksmithing without doing it in
person, but the fraternity will be glad to give you plenty of
online help. Blacksmithing has its own Web ring, and one of its
sites, anvilfire.com, has a How Do I Get Started in Blacksmithing
page with many suggestions, including these: Sign up for a welding
course at a local college or trade school. Buy a few books,
recommended online. Join Abana.
</P>
<P>
   ``Start to look for equipment and scraps of steel to experiment
with or to build equipment. Be imaginative. Don't get stuck on
setting up a classic 19th-century shop!'' The site also posts basic
information on hammers, tongs, forges and anvils, as well as how to
buy out-of-print blacksmithing books.
</P>
<P>
   The Blacksmith's Compendium, sponsored by the Celtic Knot, has
an Frequently Asked Questions list of sorts, indexed from Abana
(www.celticknot.com/elektric &QL; 
/compendium/guide.shtml). Topics include anvils and anvil repairs,
``blacksmith's elbow,'' chain mail, blade steels, Damascus steel
and ``Coal: A Brief Primer.''
</P>
<P>
   For a blacksmith's page for women, try www.blacksmithchic.com.
``In many ways, women make better blacksmiths,'' Gilbert wrote,
``since they often have less upper body strength. They cannot force
the iron to move as easily as a large man could, so they work
smarter, often with better hammer technique and control than the
average male.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most enthusiastic and charming site is the
Blacksmith's Virtual Junkyard (www.keenjunk.com), the creation of
Neil Winikoff, 79, of Bellevue, Wash., a former writer for
industrial magazines and a blacksmithing devotee for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Interspersed with pictures of Cassius, his junkyard dog, and
audio of appropriate rock songs are a joke page, how-to pages for
beginning and advanced metalworkers, listings (you want to contact
a smith in Sri Lanka?), a sketchbook page for drawings and ideas,
and an online junkyard.
</P>
<P>
   Blacksmithing sites are far removed from any guild-style
secrecy. ``The near loss of this art form isn't lost on today's
smith, either,'' Gilbert wrote by way of explanation. ``Some of the
original founding members of Abana are still around. These 30 or so
people realized that secrecy was death, and they freely shared all
that they knew, and encouraged others to do the same.''

IN ROCK'S CANON, ANYONE AND EVERYONE

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Here's a little post-holiday exercise for your
amusement: grab pen and paper and jot down your 10 favorite songs
dating from 1955 to now. Ponder carefully, or don't, depending on
whether you think music should be judged by the brain or the gut.
Call five friends and read them your list. Set up a date to argue
about it, to spin CDs and scream and shout. When you've done that,
you will have helped shape the rock 'n' roll canon.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always ask, how did the songs get in the hymnal? How do
they make that step?'' said the multi-instrumentalist and
songwriter Peter Holsapple, who helped decide which rock-era songs
could stand next to the likes of ``Take Me Out to the Ball Game''
and ``Summertime'' as the band leader at the year-ending ``Songs of
the Century'' program for arts at St. Ann's in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The great works of any art form are supposed to reveal its
potential. Shakespeare makes us realize how a play can encapsulate
a world. Picasso helps us ponder the fundamentals of seeing. And
despite recent scrutiny by those seeking to expand them, the canons
these artists occupy remain fairly solid. What orchestra doesn't
play the works of Beethoven and Brahms? Even other popular music
genres have their songbooks _ jazz players and cabaret vocalists
converse through standards, their experiments starting from the
same place.
</P>
<P>
   But the best of rock 'n' roll and its siblings, rhythm and blues
and rap, is messier, and always more in dispute. Its landmarks are
often beloved and despised in equal measure, like Led Zeppelin's
fairy-tale opus, ``Stairway to Heaven,'' or most of Elvis' oeuvre.
Even seemingly unbesmirched winners like Bob Dylan face detractors
who dismiss the whole ``classic'' era of the 1960s and hold up
canons full of disco-flavored cheese or obscure garage rock as the
real thing.
</P>
<P>
   Would-be canonizers, and every fan is one, can't even agree on
basic criteria. Rhythmic innovation matters to some, while others
live for the virtuoso guitar solo. Cultists argue for the bohemian
poeticism of artists like Patti Smith, while populists scorn such
pretensions. As for a work's influence, if you're a devotee of
funk, then the Beatles don't matter. If you're a power pop lover,
they're everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I learned most of all was that rock and soul is as
complex and self-contradictory as any living thing,'' critic Dave
Marsh wrote in the definitive work of rock 'n' roll canonizing, his
1989 book ``The Heart of Rock and Soul: the 1001 Greatest Singles
Ever Made.'' The movement is definitely afoot to establish a rock
'n' roll canon, but these efforts never feel complete, to the
credit of the music and its culture. To be a rock or rap or soul
fan is to make an argument. Perhaps the first one is with your
parents, who tell you to turn down that wretched music, but soon
after come the debates with pals who form tribes around their
favorite music styles. Because this intense, if sometimes
delusional, sense of individualism rules rock 'n' roll culture, its
canon is always exploding.
</P>
<P>
   Even the closest thing to an official list, the Rock and Roll
Hall of Fame's exhibit on the 500 most influential songs, seems
designed to stimulate contention. The exhibit, an interactive
display that allows museumgoers to listen to the tracks, includes
often-scorned fare like Duran Duran's ``Hungry Like the Wolf'' and
``U Can't Touch This,'' the M.C. Hammer song that many hip-hop
acolytes think virtually destroyed rap in the 1980s. The Rock Hall
maintains a lively online forum about the songs, allowing fans to
dissect the song list and suggest their own additions. Lightly
regarded artists like Grand Funk Railroad find their defenders,
while critical sacred cows like the Velvet Underground suffer the
jibes of the unconverted.
</P>
<P>
   The positive collision of values is what's made American
culture,'' said former Living Color guitarist Vernon Reid, who has
played rock canonizer at all-star events like this month's tribute
to Prince's 1982 album ``1999'' at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.
``It's the kind of thing where the snake eats its tail and likes
the taste.''
</P>
<P>
   Rock 'n' roll was born at a violated boundary _ between white
and black, rural and urban, commercial and folk _ and even into
middle age, the music thrives on the confusion of the busy
crossroads. Popular charts, industry-based awards and critical
writings compete with equally influential informal forces. Cover
bands maintain the lifespan of songs never nominated for a Grammy;
karaoke singers choose tracks journalists despise. Cultists make
their own collections of obscurities: lounge music revivalists
lionize Martin Denny, while hardcore punks admire Bad Brains.
</P>
<P>
   From these viewpoints a glorious yelling match about greatness
ensues, and those who dare to present their canons in public can
only try to regulate the din. The ``Songs of the Century'' program
at St. Ann's was staged like a classical recital, with five singers
_ Marshall Crenshaw, Jimmie Dale Gilmore, Sandra St. Victor, Beth
Orton and Martha Wainwright _ taking turns in front of a full band.
Holsapple and the night's other curators favored familiar choices,
like ``Blowin' in the Wind.'' Then they threw in a few surprises,
to represent rock's idiosyncratic edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were changing songs until an hour and a half before the
show,'' said Holsapple. ``It could have easily been a show of
standards, kind of a lounge thing, like Bill Murray singing
`Imagine' on `Saturday Night Live.' So it was important to also do
`I Just Wasn't Made for These Times.'''
</P>
<P>
   Such a comment suggests another central debate about whether
singles or albums represent the best of rock. As fine as it is, ``I
Just Wasn't Made for These Times'' is certainly not the most famous
or most perfectly rendered Beach Boys song. Yet many would canonize
it because it appears on the 1966 album ``Pet Sounds,'' which they
consider the Beach Boys' masterpiece, arguing that a classic album
carries more weight than even its own greatest single.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Events like the BAM performance of Prince's ``1999,'' with
singers like Joan Osborne, Corey Glover, Angelique Kidjo and Toshi
Reagon performing the double record in its original sequence, are
making albums seem like rock's equivalent to oratorios. ``The
album, as a form, is very important,'' said Reid. ``It is a song
cycle. There are climaxes and points where the record takes a left
turn; these are crucial things.''
</P>
<P>
   Some rock canonizers avoid this argument by including albums and
singles on their lists. National Public Radio's recently released
compilation of the 100 most important musical works of the century,
to be presented in segments on ``All Things Considered'' and
``Weekend Edition'' throughout the next year, includes nearly every
format and style of American music from modernist symphonies to
two-minute punk songs.
</P>
<P>
   The NPR list was selected by critics, fans and songwriters. Yet
Elizabeth Blair, the producer who coordinated the project, still
wonders if such a list can be truly representative. ``You can't
make a rock canon, because the industry is controlled. Even in the
'50s it was controlled, by company executives, critics and media
program directors,'' she said, neatly implicating herself.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that the demands of business and the tastes of
executives have long affected what music reaches the public. Yet
industry-generated lists can seem as idiosyncratic as those of the
oddest fan, as they cross the borders between good and bad taste.
</P>
<P>
   BMI, which, along with ASCAP, is one of the country's main music
performing rights organizations, recently tallied the contemporary
songs most played on television and radio and in film. No. 1 was
``You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin','' the booming plea for love sung
by the Righteous Brothers, produced by Phil Spector and written by
the stellar team of Barry Mann and Cynthia Weill.
</P>
<P>
   That song is a fairly indisputable work of genius. At its heels,
however, is the wedding reception favorite ``Never My Love'' by the
Association, a group that sounded more like youth choir Up With
People than the Beatles, who occupy the third spot with
``Yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   The BMI list continues this way, with schmaltzy soft rockers
holding their own against the milestones of rock and soul. One-hit
wonder Merilee Rush rates higher with ``Angel of the Morning'' than
the Supremes and Roy Orbison. The highest-ranking Elvis Presley
song isn't ``Hound Dog'' but ``Suspicious Minds.'' ``(I Can't Get
No) Satisfaction'' squeaks in at 91, ahead of its fellow classics
``Layla'' (93) and ``Imagine'' (96).
</P>
<P>
   The wildly varying quality on the BMI list may seem to confirm
the tendency of music programmers to promote watered-down product.
But consider another roster, this one determined strictly by fans.
``Karaoke's All Time Top 10,'' published online by Karaoke Scene
magazine, is a veritable exaltation of corn. Its critically lauded
songs, like the Patsy Cline tearjerker ``Crazy,'' are worn to the
bone. The rest is pure camp, whether deliberately fashioned, like
``Love Shack'' by the B-52s and ``YMCA'' by the Village People, or
made so by history, like Bette Midler's hyperbolic weeper ``The
Rose.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People are soppy creatures,'' said Gary Stewart, senior vice
president of Rhino Records, the leading label for anthologies.
``Ballads aren't better, but sometimes things that burn bright
don't burn long, and vice versa. I know that there's some music I
could never listen to again in the same way. Like the first Sex
Pistols record and the Clash and the early Who. Those records meant
more to me than any music did at the time. But then there are
perennials that didn't go as deep. Ballads go wide, but not deep.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart and his colleagues at Rhino have created an aesthetic
that jumps from wide to deep to reflect the rock era's intersecting
forces of silliness and profundity. The label's mid-1990s ``Have a
Nice Day'' series exhaustively chronicled pop in the 1970s, just as
that era was being reassessed by young connoisseurs who related
more to the glistening schmaltz of Sweden's Abba than the
overexposed relevance of the Rolling Stones.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart said that the interplay between pop's familiar center
and its hidden corners made anthologizing effective. ``I am against
obscurity for its own sake,'' he said. ``What's exciting to me is
finding the album cuts and the singles and the unreleased tracks
that make people say: `That's great! Why wasn't that a hit?'''
</P>
<P>
   Rhino's playful approach emphasizes the treasure-hunting spirit
that remains a key to the fan's experience of rock. Some collectors
lionize artists who have been kept from the spotlight by bad luck
or the challenging nature of their music. Less scholarly listeners
also find their treasures, often right out in the open. They create
private canons by using music in their daily lives and by
justifying their choices to their friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``The List,'' a popular new program on VH-1, captures that
process. It features celebrities, many hardly music experts,
arguing for their favorites in a given category: Best Love Song,
Sexiest Female Singer, Best Heavy Metal Group. The show evolved
from an older and far less successful program, ``Four on the
Floor,'' which had critics debating the merits of new releases.
``The List'' kept the spirit of argument but emphasized more
individual viewpoints.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized fun was more important than making the ultimate
list,'' said Jeff Gaspin, executive vice president of programming
at VH-1. ``Music is so personal _ that's what people want to share,
their personal tastes.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR;  &LR; (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Although legendary figures like John Lennon and Jimi Hendrix get
their due on ``The List,'' the show also tends to elevate current
artists and songs, reflecting the relative youth of the panelists.
The show's emphasis on what's hot right now reinforces another
truth about how people experience pop: what they think is classic
changes from year to year. Popular music is an art form people use
informally. Most don't study it in school or turn to it for
edification, as a reading group might turn to Henry James. People
use pop to get hyped up for an evening out, warm up a lover or have
a good cry.
</P>
<P>
   Most musicians also teach themselves a repertory ruled by their
personal tastes. Vernon Reid mastered guitar by playing along to
Santana's ``Caravanserai.'' Peter Holsapple learned songcraft from
the Beatles. ``They spoke to me as a child, as a teen-ager,'' he
said. ``I'm a middle-aged guy now; they're still talking to me.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, popular music itself contains a secret canon, as
musicians interpolate themes from old favorites into their own
songs without necessarily treating them like standards. Nowhere is
this approach more influential than in hip-hop, a genre literally
built from sonic fragments.
</P>
<P>
   There was a songbook, and it's called `Ultimate Breaks and
Beats,''' said ``Chairman'' Jefferson Mao, an editor at the rap
magazine Ego Trip and a co-editor of its just-published ``Ego
Trip's Book of Rap Lists.'' Mao was referring to a 25-volume album
series compiling the most frequently used breakbeats, or snippets
of songs, used by hip-hop DJs to construct their musical collages.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the 150 cuts on these albums, like ``Funky President''
by James Brown, are well-regarded, while others, like ``Apache'' by
the Incredible Bongo Band, are barely known. But each contained a
guitar lick, vocal whoop or drum roll that became part of hip-hop's
alphabet.
</P>
<P>
   After Lenny Roberts, an amateur collector, and the DJ Afrika
Bambaataa began assembling these anthologies in 1986, the treasure
hunt of hip-hop became a much easier game. ``There are songs that,
if you dissect the samples, they are all from volume such and
such,'' said Mao. ``People found a way to mix them in one song.
It's like using `l-m-n-o' as one letter. But they still were able
to flip it in a creative way.''
</P>
<P>
   With DJs besting each other with original twists on the same
breakbeats, hip-hop became an art of references. Although copyright
restrictions that arose when original artists started suing DJs
have limited the number of samples used, a trend classicists like
Mao deeply regret, the craft of crooked assembly still dominates
hip-hop's adventurous edge.
</P>
<P>
   Now that hip-hop is a quarter century old, it is being
institutionalized, like rock before it. The Ego Trip book is part
of that process, along with the publication of ``The Vibe History
of Hip-Hop'' and the major exhibit on the subject staged at the
Rock Hall this year. Yet Mao let forth a scornful laugh at the idea
there could ever be a definitive hip-hop canon.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way to do that,'' he said. ``We did lists of the
greatest MCs and producers. We didn't want to, but people would be
beefing.'' Readers wanted those lists, he said, so they could rip
them apart. ``Everyone wants to argue. Hip-hop and rap, it's all
debate.'' So the canon-making continues, in the tradition of all
the loudmouths who've loved rock 'n' roll.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Say hello to Lucy Jane Wasserstein. Mother:
Pulitzer-prize winning playwright, Wendy Wasserstein. Father: not
yet announced. Born: Sept. 12, 1999, in Mount Sinai Hospital, New
York. Weight: 790 grams, under 2 lbs. And what a production it was!
</P>
<P>
   The director Gerald Gutierrez (``The Heiress,'' ``A Delicate
Balance'') was in the delivery room. The costume designer William
Ivey Long (``Crazy for You,'' ``Chicago,'' ``Guys and Dolls'')
decorated the hospital room. Meryl Streep, Ms. Wasserstein's friend
from the Yale Drama School, sneaked in to see the baby, incognito.
The writer James Lapine (``Passion,'' ``Sunday in the Park With
George'') and the set designer Heidi Ettinger (``Big River,'' ``The
Secret Garden'') brought mother and baby home.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you haven't won a Tony, can you go?'' Ms. Ettinger asked as
she waited outside Mount Sinai's intensive care unit for Lucy Jane
to come out in her car seat for the cab ride to Ms. Wasserstein's
apartment on the Upper West Side.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wasserstein, 49, has long been called ``the voice of her
generation.'' She came of age when a new definition of what it
meant to be a woman was formulating. In a sense, she has lived most
of the stories in her plays.
</P>
<P>
   She was Holly in ``Uncommon Women'' (1977), about a Mount
Holyoke graduate and her friends who cope with the uncertainties of
identity in the new age of feminism. ``My parents used to call me
three times a week at 7 a.m. to ask me, `Are you thin, are you
married to a root-canal man, are  &UR; you &LR;  a root canal man?''' Holly
says at one point.
</P>
<P>
   Janie, the heroine in ``Isn't It Romantic'' (1983), trying to
decide whether to marry a boring doctor, fantasizes about having a
child by herself: ``I can imagine myself at 36, driving
cross-country to inseminate myself with a turkey baster.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to give birth to a little oven-stuffer roaster,''
Janie adds.
</P>
<P>
   And in ``An American Daughter'' (1997), the character Judith
Kaufman, an oncologist, has fertility treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Lucy's birth is in effect the final act of ``The Heidi
Chronicles'' (1989), in which the heroine (whose name was borrowed
from Ms. Ettinger), after much spiritual anguish and backing and
forthing, becomes a single mother and sits, rocking her baby and
singing, ``Darling, you send me. . . . Honest you do, honest you
do, honest you do.''
</P>
<P>
   The real-life baby, Lucy Jane, was born nearly three months
premature and had to stay in the neonatal intensive care unit for
two months, though her mother tried to think of her as being away
at ``a good Jewish boarding school which specializes in the
sciences,'' as usual leavening the painful with a wisecrack. ``She
came early because she knew it was hard to get in,'' Ms.
Wasserstein said. ``She's very competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wasserstein had been thinking about having a child for more
than 10 years, she said. She came from a family of four children.
``Now we're depleted,'' she said; her sister Sandra Meyer died of
cancer in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But before moving ahead, she first had to decide whether to have
the baby alone. Ms. Wasserstein has no husband, or a steady
boyfriend, for that matter. She mentions one particular
relationship with a man that didn't work out.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are a large number of men, gay and straight, whom
Ms. Wasserstein regards as ``husbands,'' she said. They include
Stephen Graham, founder of the New York Theater Workshop; William
Finn, who wrote ``Falsettos''; Andre Bishop, the artistic director
of Lincoln Center Theater; and Gutierrez. She knew that no child of
hers would lack for ``fathers.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wasserstein has always been big on ``to do'' lists. So,
around her 40th birthday, along with ``Lose weight,'' ``Write a
play'' and ``Read more,'' she put, ``Have a baby.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just assumed I would have no trouble, being a big, hearty
girl,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When that assumption proved wrong, she began having fertility
treatments. ``I would go through periods when there was Perganol
and Clomid,'' she said. But that didn't work. ``I would stop for
two years. It's quite emotional.''
</P>
<P>
   She was 48 and had given up trying when, mourning the death of
her sister, she ran into her old fertility doctor, ``whom I
loved,'' she said. ``He said, `You should try again.' I thought `I
hate you!''' So, she decided, ``Once more, with feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   And this time Ms. Wasserstein got pregnant. Just how, she's not
saying right now, but the father is ``someone I know who I am
keeping anonymous,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the pregnancy went well. Ms. Wasserstein had a
fellowship at the American Academy in Rome, where she was writing
``Old Money,'' a play about money and class to be produced at
Lincoln Center next fall. She flew back to New York every three
weeks to check in with her doctors.
</P>
<P>
   In her sixth month, she developed pre-eclampsia, high blood
pressure with the potential for both kidney and liver failure. To
preserve the pregnancy, her doctor ordered her to the hospital.

 &HT;        Temp wages going up 
 &HT;      Higher demand for more skilled workers in a fixed labor market
is a likely cause. 
 &HT;     Laura J. Winter  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Dec. 22 -- Demand for contingent and alternative
workers is sending weekly wages up, according to statistics
released Tuesday by the Department of Labor's Bureau of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   The number of people in this group of workers, non-permanent,
have remained at 5.8 million, while their salaries have risen by an
average of 10 percent since 1997. Independent contractors and
contract company employees outpaced other contingent workers with a
22 percent increase in wages from $523 in February 1997 to $640 in
February 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The trend toward higher wages not only reflects the increase in
demand, but makes staffing decisions more painful, said William
Dennis, a senior research fellow at the National Federation of
Independent Businesses Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The small business owner is deciding whether or not it is
worth it to hire a temporary worker or close the store three hours
earlier,'' Dennis said.
</P>
<P>
   Temporary workers since 1997 have seen their wages grow slightly
from $329 a week in 1997 to $342 this year, a 3 percent increase.
On-call workers' wages increased 9 percent from $432 in 1997 to
$472 in 1999. Other contingent workers who did not fit into any
specific category also experienced an increase as well, earning
$540 this year over the $510 two years ago, up 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis said the wage increases were more than demand and supply
reaction but also a change in the quality of worker businesses want
and can hire. The trend, he said, points to more people, especially
independent contractors, with more valuable skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mix of people working these jobs is changing,'' Dennis
said. ``Traditionally workers with lots of skills used to be
employees. What you are seeing are people with lots of skills doing
things independently.''

 NEW YORK: the hospital.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Each day at 5, cocktail hour, Gutierrez would come by. Ms.
Wasserstein would have juice and the two would ``sit around and
vote for Best Supporting Actor in the Birth of Lucy Jane'' among
the nurses and doctors. Ms. Wasserstein's friend Jane Rosenthal,
co-owner with Robert De Niro of Tribeca Productions, whose name the
playwright used for Janie in ``Isn't It Romantic,'' took over the
producing. ``It was: `Get the nightie. Get the food,''' Ms.
Wasserstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, Lucy was born, at about 27 weeks' gestation. At
the same time, Ms. Wasserstein's brother, Bruce, the investment
banker, whose wife was giving birth to a son elsewhere in the
hospital, went around the building proclaiming of Lucy, ``It's my
child!''
</P>
<P>
   As word of the birth got out, friends called to cheer Ms.
Wasserstein on. The director Jerry Zaks told her his daughter had
been in the same neonatal unit and was now bright and healthy.
``Everyone called and said, `My brother was premature and a brain
surgeon,''' Ms. Wasserstein said. ``As far as I know, all premature
babies are brain surgeons.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, just before Thanksgiving, Lucy was doing well enough to
go home for the holidays. Within a week, she had gained a pound,
although, Ms. Wasserstein noted, ``weight gain runs in my family.''
By mid-December, Lucy weighed nearly seven pounds and was
``speaking French in iambic pentameter,'' Ms. Wasserstein said.
``She likes Virginia Woolf.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week Ms. Rosenthal held a baby shower at her home in the
Dakota. There was a pink silk cloth on the table with big pink bows
on it, petits fours, topiary, and chocolate cigars inscribed,
``It's a girl.''
</P>
<P>
   On hand, it seemed, was much of the theater establishment,
including at least two of Lucy Jane's ``fathers,'' Graham and
Bishop. Zaks came, and Paul Rudnick and Terrence McNally. Bernard
Gersten, executive producer of Lincoln Center Theater, was there.
The decorator Mario Buatta, ``the Prince of Chintz,'' was, too.
``He once named a sheet after me,'' Ms. Wasserstein said. Linda
Janklow, chairwoman of Lincoln Center Theater, and Lynn Nesbitt,
the agent, attended. Joan Allen, who played Heidi in the original
``Heidi Chronicles,'' came, and the director Daniel Sullivan. There
was Tina Howe, Marsha Norman and Honor Moore.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Ms. Wasserstein encapsulated her generation, sitting
at the center of a display of a new kind of mix of femininity,
wealth, power and domesticity. Ms. Rosenthal's personal assistant
mingled with her baby sitter and housekeeper. Her two daughters, in
little silk dresses, looked like children in a Sargent painting.
Lucy herself, though, was not present; it was cold season and no
one wanted her to catch anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to know when you're going to write the play about
this,'' Pat Schoenfeld, the wife of Gerald Schoenfeld, chairman of
the Shubert Organization, asked Ms. Wasserstein. (Ms. Wasserstein
is writing a prose account of her pregnancy.)
</P>
<P>
   ``How's it going?'' said Donna Hanover, wife of New York's
mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's home. She's growing,'' Ms. Wasserstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was time for toasts. ``We just want to raise a glass to
our beloved Wendy,'' Ms. Rosenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just bursting with joy,'' Ms. Wasserstein told the crowd.
``Peter at the end of `The Heidi Chronicles' says, `In our lives
our friends are our families.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And that has been very true in my life.''

 &HT;    Aetna fined for raising rates without approval
 &HT;    By Andy Miller
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _Aetna U.S. Healthcare has agreed to a $50,000 fine and
will pay refunds to employers for raising HMO rates without getting
a state agency's approval.
</P>
<P>
   Employers covering an estimated 700 consumers in Georgia were
charged the unapproved rates and will receive the refunds.
</P>
<P>
   According to a consent order signed Tuesday by Aetna U.S.
Healthcare, the company filed the rate increases with state
Insurance Commissioner John Oxendine's office in April, but didn't
get the agency's permission before implementing the higher rates in
July.
</P>
<P>
   Oxendine said the refunds would amount to an estimated $40,000.
But credits off current and future bills would run ''in the
hundreds of thousands of dollars,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   An Aetna U.S. Healthcare spokesman acknowledged Wednesday that
the company charged the new HMO rates in error. Unlike Georgia,
many other states allow new HMO rates to be implemented without
prior regulatory approval, said spokesman Walt Cherniak.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's simply a mistake,'' Cherniak said. ``We'll work
diligently to rectify the situation and promptly refund the money
back.'' The overall financial impact will be minimal, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Oxendine said the error should not have occurred. ``There's no
excuse for this happening,'' he said. ``I think they were sloppy.''
His office will continue to monitor the Aetna situation, Oxendine
added.
</P>
<P>
   After its recent acquisition of Prudential's health-care
operations, Aetna now provides health insurance for about 900,000
Georgians _ the second-largest statewide enrollment behind Blue
Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna, though, has the biggest membership among HMOs and similar
point-of-service plans in metro Atlanta, with 300,000 enrollees.
Through its Aetna U.S. Healthcare unit, Hartford-based Aetna is the
largest U.S. managed-care company.
</P>
<P>
   The unapproved HMO rates were charged to employers in July and
August. The Insurance Commissioner's Office notified the company of
the problem in September during a routine review.
</P>
<P>
   Oxendine's action coincides with other marketplace turmoil
involving Aetna. The insurer has triggered local and national
criticism from physicians groups for some contract provisions with
doctors. These include the insurer's ''all-products'' policy, which
requires that if a doctor treats patients in one Aetna plan, such
as a PPO, the doctor must take patients in all Aetna plans,
including those in an HMO.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna explains that the policy guarantees that if patients
switch between Aetna plan types, they won't have to change doctors.
But physicians have complained about Aetna's HMO fees and about
what they call the company's heavy-handed tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have such a market share that if you say, 'I don't want
the all-products clause,' you lose 20 percent to 30 percent of your
patients,'' says Dr. Ted Lewers, chairman of the American Medical
Association's board.
</P>
<P>
   The Medical Association of Georgia, the state's largest
physicians organization, has criticized Aetna's definition of
medical necessity. MAG, in addition, has asked the U.S. Justice
Department to study the group's objections to the Prudential merger
in the metro Atlanta marketplace. Aetna counters that it's a done
deal -- including in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   And recently, Rockdale Hospital decided to stop accepting Aetna
HMO patients starting Jan. 1, after several denials of HMO payments
by the insurer.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna says it's working on a resolution with the Conyers
hospital.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The global terrorism scare shouldn't force
Americans to scrub their holiday plans, but it calls for sharply
increased vigilance, President Clinton said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton then invited citizens to flock to the nation's capital
for the millennium bash he is hosting on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the American people should stop their holiday
activities. I think they ought to go on and enjoy the season,''
Clinton told reporters after stuffing peppers at a downtown kitchen
that serves meals to the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``But because we in the government are taking extra steps and
we're on alert, I think it would be good for them and good for us
if they'd just be careful and _ not suspicious _ but aware of their
circumstances,'' Clinton said. ``And if they see anything that
doesn't look right, to report it to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities are making ``extraordinary efforts,'' Clinton said,
to defend against terrorist attacks following the arrest last week
of Ahmed Ressam for allegedly trying to smuggle jars of
nitroglycerin, timers and other potential bomb-making materials
into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam, an Algerian native, traveled by ferry from Canada to
Port Angeles, Wash., where U.S. Customs officials arrested him.
Ressam, 32, was indicted in Seattle on Wednesday by a federal grand
jury, which formally charged him with transporting explosives,
lying to U.S. Customs officers and three other counts.
</P>
<P>
   In two other signs of heightened security concerns, U.S. Customs
officers detained a man in the Bahamas as he prepared to board a
flight to Miami and police in Washington searched for a blue van
with Texas plates after a citizen reported suspicious activity.
</P>
<P>
   With anti-American terrorist organizations threatening to target
U.S. facilities and citizens over the holiday season, intelligence
agents and law enforcement officials are working around the clock
to tighten security at border crossings, airports, military bases
and federal buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration warns travelers not to wrap
holiday gifts they plan to carry aboard an airplane, because they
might be asked to open them at the airport for inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has issued a series of warnings in
recent days _ reiterated on Wednesday _ cautioning Americans that
they could be targeted by terrorists at home or abroad during the
holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some groups out there that seem determined to ruin
the holiday, if they can, and to kill Americans and others, if they
can,'' Defense Secretary William Cohen said in an interview with
ABC-TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of our intelligence agencies are cooperating worldwide
with their counterparts,'' said Cohen, ``to make sure that we have
the latest possible information, to make sure that we can deter,
detect, and discourage any attempts on American lives anywhere in
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities were investigating the possibility that Ressam and
other suspected terrorists might have links with Osama bin Laden,
the most wanted man on the U.S. list of suspected international
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   A Saudi national believed to be in hiding somewhere in
Afghanistan, bin Laden is accused by the State Department of
masterminding explosions that destroyed two American embassies in
Africa last year, killing hundreds. Since those attacks, bin Laden
has issued specific death threats against Americans and has called
for an Islamic holy war targeting U.S. citizens and facilities
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   (Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
   The threat to Americans also comes from within the nation's
borders.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta Wednesday, civil rights leaders and representatives
of African American churches gathered to warn of the threat that
white supremacists and apocalyptic zealots pose to homosexuals and
people of color as the holidays draw near.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an emergency,'' the Rev. C.T. Vivian, chairman of the
board of directors for the Center for Democratic Renewal, a civil
rights advocacy group, said at a press conference. ``It's an
emergency for the nation, but it's a far greater emergency for
minorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Joined at the press conference by representative of the National
Coalition for Burned Churches, Vivian cited specific threats to
religious gatherings of predominantly black worshippers.
</P>
<P>
   Vivian assailed the Justice Department for not doing enough to
alert the public to the dangers face by black churches, the center
of social activities in many communities across the South.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said any such threats would
be treated with urgency by U.S. law enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, that's something that the Department of Justice
would take quite seriously,'' Lockhart told reporters. ``I think
it's, particularly this time of year, it's repugnant of people to
make threats along those lines.''

are planned,'' Assistant Attorney General Eric Holder said in a

   Holder stopped short of advising Americans to avoid crowds, a
common target of terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not say that we are in a position to tell people to
avoid any large
</P>
<P>
   gatherings,'' Holder said. ``We certainly don't want to
unnecessarily alarm people.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he urged citizens to attend the New Year's festivities
Clinton has planned. He said police and other security agents would
be out in force to try to lock down the area along the
two-mile-long National Mall, where the New Year's gala is to be
centered.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be an extensive law enforcement presence,''
Holder said. ``I would encourage people to go there.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton went a step further, releasing an advertisement
distributed to hundreds of radio stations nationwide, urging
Americans to join in what he billed as ``a spectacular three-day
celebration'' featuring a star-studded entertainment extravaganza
and midnight fireworks over the mall.

<P>
   ``I want to invite all Americans to join Hillary and me for

 TALKS-NYT  (nk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   RAMALLAH, West Bank _ Despite speculation that the resumption of
Israeli-Syrian talks would derail the Palestinian peace track,
significant progress appeared to have been made early Wednesday
morning in an intimate meeting here between Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time that an Israeli prime minister had
ventured into a Palestinian-ruled city for a peace meeting, which
in itself broke a barrier in the relationship. And the setting was
very casual: Barak and Arafat met in the elegant home of the
Palestinian leader's second-in-command, Mahmoud Abbas, better known
as Abu Mazen.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Abu Mazen's villa, the two leaders talked for three hours
from late Tuesday until early Wednesday, gathered with their
associates around a banquet of salads and meat dishes. Outside,
security, both Israeli and Palestinian, was tight, but the meeting
and its location had been kept secret and there were no
disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, both sides said that two deadlocked issues
that have bedeviled progress in the Israeli-Palestinian talks were
essentially resolved. An Israeli transfer of 5 percent of the West
Bank, which has been delayed for five weeks, was likely to take
place within a week, both sides said. And the Israelis were also
expected to release more prisoners as a gesture for Ramadan, the
Islamic holy month now underway.
</P>
<P>
   The details were left to negotiators who did not attend the
late-night summit. Saeb Erekat, a senior Palestinian negotiator,
left an early evening negotiating session in Jerusalem Wednesday
night, declaring that not a single issue had been resolved.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether Erekat was sincerely downbeat or adopting
a tough posture. His negative stance stood in contrast to the
comments from two senior Palestinians who attended the late-night
meeting. Exuding confidence, they both said earlier Wednesday that
the Palestinians would ``witness results in the very near future,''
in the words of Nabil Aburdeini, a senior adviser to Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, another senior Palestinian had suggested that
the Palestinians, who had held up the land transfer because they
were disappointed that the land consisted largely of unpopulated
desert, were persuaded to accept the original land offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah, we still have two other redeployments,'' the senior
Palestinian official said, referring to two more land transfers,
the first scheduled for January. The official suggested that the
Palestinians had been given assurances that more populated
territory would be included in the next Israeli withdrawals from
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides reported that the atmosphere at the late-night
meeting was good and open, and that they would now accelerate
talks, including more face-to-face sessions between the two
leaders, in preparation for a possible February summit in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting ``renewed the trust and cooperation between the two
sides,'' Foreign Minister David Levy said on Israel Radio, adding
that the territorial transfer was imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Contradicting such optimism, Erekat suggested that summits were
atmospherics. ``We are the ones who do the negotiating,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the late-night summit, Arafat was accompanied not only by Abu
Mazen but also by Abu Ala, the speaker of the Palestinian
Legislative Council. Abu Ala, who received considerable credit for
his role as senior negotiator of the Oslo peace accord, is
technically no longer a negotiator.
</P>
<P>
   But, with his calm, business-like manner, he, as one Palestinian
analyst said is ``the man who has the keys in his hands when things
get stuck.''
</P>
<P>
   Abu Ala reportedly met more than a dozen times with former Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Barak was joined by Levy and Danny Yatom, his security adviser,
both of whom accompanied him to Washington last week.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the meeting, Barak gave Arafat a 40-minute
briefing on his meetings in Washington with the Syrian foreign
minister, Farouk al-Sharaa.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told him that he told Sharaa that we have a commitment
toward Palestinians, and that everything should be honest and
decent,'' a senior Israeli official said. ``He told him that he
told Sharaa that we are not going to play or use one track against
the other because we will lose. We will continue simultaneously.
And he said that Sharaa responded positively and said he
appreciated, understood and respected all that.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli prime ministers have stepped onto Palestinian soil,
crossing a few yards over the border at the Erez checkpoint in
Gaza. But this represented the first genuine foray into the heart
of the Palestinian Authority's territory, and a kind of submission
to their turf. The Palestinians were decidedly the hosts at the
white stone and red brick villa in a quiet neighborhood. And they
sounded very upbeat afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will witness starting from next week progress in all
respects,'' a senior Palestinian official said. ``Barak promised to
honor all his commitments in the interim agreements. We told him
that this will create a positive atmosphere. Barak also spoke a lot
of settlement activity, and he gave positive promises. But on that
front, it's premature. We have to wait and witness that he does
what he says.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak, whose government has angered Palestinians by authorizing
new construction at Jewish settlements in the West Bank, has
promised to freeze the expansion. He has acknowledged that it was
counter-productive in his deadline pursuit of a final status
framework peace agreement by mid-February.
</P>
<P>
   But the Palestinians are wary. Formal final status negotiations
have stalled because of their concern, although quiet talks have
been continuing. One Palestinian participant in talks about land
and border issues says that even Jerusalem, the touchiest subject
and one that Israel has said is nonnegotiable, has been broached.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Israelis keep talking about the al-Aqsa mosque and the
Mount of Olives,'' he said. ``Which means they are talking about
the fate of Jerusalem.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The house, like a family, has its secrets. The
domestic surfaces lie, until you start listening to your memory of
them, until you look at their commonplaces as clues.
</P>
<P>
   When Mary Gordon, the best-selling author, was 13, she went
through the drawers of a boarder in her mother's house, an incident
she recounts in her new memoir, ``Seeing Through Places''
(Scribner), to be published next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I opened his drawers,'' Ms. Gordon recalls in the book.
``Found handkerchiefs, perfectly folded. A few shirts. Two
sweaters, in a drawer of their own. And then, in the bottom, a
collection of books I knew were there because they needed to be
hidden.''
</P>
<P>
   For a pubescent snoop, she hit the jackpot. It was pornography:
10 explicit books of it. Though what provoked her invasion was the
``sexual curiosity of well-behaved girls,'' she writes, what she
discovered ``crushed my imagination.'' She continues, ``It wasn't
the feather touch of titillation, or the quick chase of arousal,
but the paralyzing force of a puzzlement so deep that the mind
feels like a locked machine.''
</P>
<P>
   The room revealed a story, too. The boarder was never in it; he
was having an affair with the Gordons' married neighbor. It was as
empty as a broken vow.
</P>
<P>
   Places can be accomplices, as culpable as people.
</P>
<P>
   At 50, with what could be described as a moral challenge in her
eyes, Ms. Gordon still looks like the Long Island girl, born in
Queens, brought up in Valley Stream, who might go through a drawer
to get at the ``mystery that can surround or locate itself at the
center of a house's life,'' as she writes, that exists in the lives
of the people who live there.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gordon lives on the Upper West Side with her husband, Arthur
Cash, an author and retired professor of English; their 16-year-old
son, David Cash, and a white-muzzled 12-year-old black Labrador
retriever, Peggy, who passes like time through the narrow corridors
of the apartment, securing each room. A daughter, Anna Cash, 18, is
now at Columbia University. Ms. Gordon teaches at Barnard College.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of place became important ``because I'm finally in the
place I want to be,'' Ms. Gordon said recently, dressed in a black
suit and white blouse, sitting at her dining room table drinking
coffee. ``I'm in New York _ `the city,' as we called it _ which was
always the great, good place to me, where you were free and the
trivial was burned away.''
</P>
<P>
   The relationships between people have been the structure of both
her fiction, like her debut, ``Final Payments'' in 1978, and her
memoirs, like ``The Shadow Man,'' a 1996 portrait of her father,
David Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in ``Seeing Through Places,'' the houses and places of her
experience are characters and family members. They have an
emotional life, which is a kind of alternative architecture that
Ms. Gordon inhabits in her book. They open doors.
</P>
<P>
   There was, in the house she lived in as a girl with her young
parents, the empty attic ``meant to be our storage space, but we
had nothing to store,'' Ms. Gordon writes, not even a sense of
history. Her father, an intellectual and writer, lied pretentiously
about his past as a French aristocrat who was educated at Harvard
and Oxford, concealing his birth as a Lithuanian Jew who converted
to Catholicism and who dropped out of high school.
</P>
<P>
   Imprisoned by deceit, he stripped his life like a cell.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took pride in ignoring his surroundings,'' Ms. Gordon
recalls in her book. ``To care about things like furniture would
have been for him a proof of an inferior nature.''
</P>
<P>
   On summer evenings, her mother, Anna Gordon, a legal secretary,
whose income supported the household, ironed in a sleeveless dress,
``freckled like an early apple.'' Ms. Gordon was an only child, the
single fruit of an unhappy marriage. As she listened from the
living room, the iron hissed; there were gunshots on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   Undecorated, unembarrassed, furnished for comfort with favorite
things, Ms. Gordon's New York apartment lacks the sophisticated
relationships of design. ``I was brought up to think that things
were not important,'' she said. ``And yet I love them. But I had to
discover it on my own. We never talked about them in my family.''
</P>
<P>
   In the dining room, a William Morris fruit-pattern fabric,
laminated for spills, covers the table. On the wall is a drawing by
Vuillard, whom Ms. Gordon has defended against the charge that his
art was minor because he painted interiors. He spoke ``the deep,
secret language of home truths,'' she wrote in an article in 1990.
In the long hallway is a bright Mexican carving of a creature that
is half insect and half woman and a discolored decoupage table that
belonged to the writer Katherine Anne Porter.
</P>
<P>
   When called a materialist, Ms. Gordon giggled quickly, like a
young girl hearing an obscenity.
</P>
<P>
   She writes with a black enamel, gold-trimmed Waterman pen in
notebooks she collected on travels in Paris, Dublin and Rome. It is
a recognition of what Katherine Anne Porter called, at the end of
her 1939 novel ``Pale Horse, Pale Rider,'' the ``art of the
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether stockings or a sentence, there is a ``fineness and
goodness,'' she said, and a power of revelation to the craft of
things ``that can give you a tremendous sense of hope.'' She added,
``And bad things are despair inducing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gordon told a story about her mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd written five books, I'd had my children, I'd really been a
fairly respectable person,'' she said. ``I was looking at a catalog
from Bergdorf Goodman. I was saying: `Oh, look at that jacket. I
love that jacket.' My mother looked at me in all seriousness and
said, `When exactly did you become such a superficial person?'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gordon's father died when she was 7. He had a heart attack
in the main reading room of the New York Public Library, a place
Ms. Gordon treasures because it is charged with the atmosphere of
his memory. ``It makes me incredibly happy,'' she said. Her father
took her there every Saturday; she learned to read at 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, if I just go to the reading room, he'll be there
reading,'' she said. They might be there together.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In her grandmother's house in Valley Stream, where she moved
with her mother when her father died, there were frightening
``unmodern smells,'' ammonia and lavender, that turned the air dark
to a child. An unmarried aunt lived upstairs, and an unmarried
uncle slept on an unheated porch with an unplayed piano. It became
her mother's house after Ms. Gordon's grandmother died.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not a loving house,'' Ms. Gordon writes.
</P>
<P>
   But her grandmother washed her silver hair outside in the
summer, in the sunshine of the backyard, with a white pitcher and a
blue towel and a battered tin basin, while the children watched,
with a ritual that was ``inexplicably celebratory,'' Ms. Gordon
recalls in ``Seeing Through Places.'' If the routine of domestic
habit is a ring of fire, it is also a magic circle.
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Gordon, the home is a vexed place, with an ambiguous
halo. She spoke of Virginia Woolf, whose photograph hangs in her
hallway.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was terrified of domesticity,'' Ms. Gordon said. ``She
said that the woman writer has to kill the `angel in the house.'
She saw it as a complete threat.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gordon said that she also saw it as a threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things I dislike about domesticity is that it makes
people so anxious,'' she said, ``because they feel so judged, about
the way their home is constructed. Particularly women; if you feel
you're always on trial, that your worth is being proved by the
state of your abode, it makes for a lot of shame.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gordon mentioned Iris Murdoch, another favorite writer, who
lived in a ``filthy house,'' she said, undisturbed by housekeeping,
which for a woman was an indication of ``spiritual squalor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If your house is not tidy, even if you've just happened to
finish `War and Peace' that day, you would still be judged by it,''
Ms. Gordon said. Proust lived like a pig, ``because he's a
genius,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   But she sees domesticity as an attraction, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to reclaim some of the pleasures,'' she said.
``It's a way of understanding who you can be in the world, and what
you were told you couldn't be, and what you were told you must be.
I'm fascinated by the way houses make people behave, in very
practical ways, and I think that's a particularly female focus.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing Through Places'' is something of a response: a creation
_ like a room of one's own _ that carves security from fear, by
giving it shape.
</P>
<P>
   Writing of the sitter's house, where she was left each day while
her parents worked, Ms. Gordon recalls, ``The darkness of her house
was in itself a kind of architecture.'' Inside boxes, under tables,
children contain the anxieties of abandonment. At home, Ms. Gordon
played in her father's closet, fragrant with his clothes.
</P>
<P>
   In her New York apartment, she has built a life in which she can
write in the morning, read in her red velvet slippers and be with
her family, the things that are important to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a place to be quiet, and a place to be private,'' she
said of the idea of a home. ``These things seem so endangered. You
need a refuge.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gordon's husband woke from a nap and left the bedroom for
the bathroom. Peggy, at her post by the front door, got up to see
who it was.
</P>
<P>
   The writer offered to show a visitor her office, down the hall.
She is finishing a biography of Joan of Arc, to be published next
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do have a room of my own,'' she said, lowering her voice as
she walked in, ``and I close the door.''

Nannies agency's adult baby sitters. They will pay the sitters $330
each for the affair and triple the agency's usual rate. So it will
be in most big cities and their affluent suburbs this New Year's
Eve. Teen-age baby sitters stand to earn $200 or $300 for one

<TEXT>
<P>
   Most homeowners assume that a home with adequate insulation is
energy efficient. Insulation, however, will only keep interior heat
from passing through solid materials like wallboard or wood.
Weather stripping and caulking are also necessary to stop warm air
from escaping through the many gaps around the house. Together,
weatherstripping and insulation create a thermal barrier between
the inside and outside of the home.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the average homeowner assumes that the only
cracks that need caulk are around the doors and windows of the
house, but there are probably also a number of gaps in the attic
that should be closed. Attic insulation and weather stripping are
important because most heat losses in the home occur through the
roof.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the hot air in the house rises to the top of the
building causing an increase in the air pressure at the ceiling. As
the pressure increases, the hot air slips past the insulation
through open gaps. Failure to seal attic gaps can lessen the
effectiveness of the insulation by as much as half.
</P>
<P>
   The best time to seal gaps in the attic floor is before the
insulation is laid down. Lay planks across the joists and crawl to
the remote corners of the attic. Do not try to walk on the joints;
if you slip, you could fall through the ceiling. Look for gaps
around anything that projects through the ceiling. Wiring,
plumbing, vent stacks, air ducts and the chimney typically have
holes or gaps that should be sealed.
</P>
<P>
   If your attic is already insulated, the search will be a little
more difficult, but not impossible. Most attics are insulated with
fiberglass batts positioned between the joists. These can be rolled
back to expose wiring or duct work. Fiberglass can be irritating to
the skin so wear long pants, a long-sleeved shirt, gloves, goggles
and a dust mask before handling the batts. As you roll back each
batt, look for gray or black smudges on the insulation. These are
indications of air leaks nearby.
</P>
<P>
   It is harder to look for air leaks in attics that are insulated
with loose fill, because this type of insulation cannot be rolled
back. Instead, it must be scooped out into a holding container,
then replaced after the inspection. Here it might be better to hire
a professional weatherization contractor.
</P>
<P>
   Once you have detected gaps, how do you seal them to keep air
from coming through? That depends on the width of the gap and where
it is. Use latex caulk to close narrow cracks (less than 3/8-inch
wide) around pipes and wires. For wider gaps, use expanding
urethane foam. This comes in aerosol cans. Be careful when using
this foam because it is hard to remove from clothes. You can also
make plugs out of drywall or fiberglass insulation stuffed in
plastic bags and wedge these into wide cracks.
</P>
<P>
   Do not use caulk or insulation to plug gaps around the chimney
because the heat from the chimney could damage it. Instead, make a
metal collar out of roof flashing. Tack one side of the flashing to
the top of a nearby joist and push the other edge against the
chimney.
</P>
<P>
   The entry to most attics is through a hole in the attic floor.
This is usually closed with either a door or a hatch. Even though
the door is inside the house, it should have a layer of insulation
on the attic side, and weatherstripping around the edges around the
hatch.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a forced-air heating system, examine the duct work
that runs through the attic. Leaky heating ducts allow hot air to
spill into the attic and pull cold air into the heating system.
Most leaks occur at the joints between duct sections. In some
cases, the sections may actually have pulled apart, but often they
may only be loose.
</P>
<P>
   Reconnect the disjointed sections then seal all joints with duct
mastic. If the joints are wide or have a tendency to separate,
reinforce the mastic with fiberglass mesh tape or aluminum tape. Do
not use the familiar gray cloth tape, often called ''duct tape,''
because the heat from the ducts will cause it to dry out and
deteriorate. After sealing the joints, wrap the ducts with
foil-faced fiberglass insulation. Use cable ties to hold the
insulation in place.
</P>
<P>
   You may be tempted to pack insulation around recessed ceiling
lights, but don't do it. These lights generate heat so they must
have at least three inches clearance space on all sides for
cooling. If you suspect that the present lights are letting air
flow past, you can replace these fixtures with special IC fixtures
that have air-and moisture-tight housings.

DEMOCRACY REARS ITS UNPREDICTABLE HEAD IN LONDON MAYORAL CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: A photo of Glenda Jackson is being sent to NYT photo
clients. Nonsubscribers can make individual purchase by calling

 By WARREN HOGE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Letting Londoners choose their own chief executive
would strike most people as a long overdue exercise. But the
campaign for the first directly elected mayor of this city of eight
million residents has caught British politicians ill-prepared, with
embarrassing consequences all around.
</P>
<P>
   Selection of the Conservative and Labor nominees for the May
election has been delayed until next month, and the contest for an
office that will have a larger popular mandate than any other in
Britain has become the stuff of soap opera, with the sex scandal
resignation of one candidate and the barring of another for his
confessed serial adultery.
</P>
<P>
   A political contest in which personality suddenly plays a more
important role than party voting habits has shaken headquarters
control and attracted hopefuls from nontraditional sectors. Among
them are two baronesses, a gay rights activist, a punk rock
entrepreneur, an Internet millionaire, the novelist Jeffrey Archer
and the Academy Award-winning actress Glenda Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am quite an imaginative person,'' Ms. Jackson said when
asked about the chaotic course of events thus far, ``but in my
wildest imaginings, I would never have imagined this. If somebody
had put it before me as a script, I would have thrown it across the
room as unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea to grant Londoners the right to elect their mayor is
part of Prime Minister Tony Blair's project known as ``devolution''
under which the highly centralized control that the capital
exercises in British life is being diluted and spread out _ or
``devolved'' _ to the country's regions.
</P>
<P>
   New legislatures have been created in Northern Ireland, Scotland
and Wales, and a bill is now moving through Parliament to permit
direct elections for mayor in other British cities.
</P>
<P>
   London had a limited form of local government until 1986, when
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher abolished the Greater London
Council and turned the running of the city over to the national
government. The unrelated position of lord mayor, dating from 1215,
is an appointive office that names a business leader to oversee the
City of London financial center for a year at a time.
</P>
<P>
   The London mayoralty has thrown up a new contradiction in
British public life that has produced the current gaudy confusion.
The national parties are taking part in an effort that gives local
people a more direct role in deciding who represents them, but are
showing no willingness to relax their grip over the choice of
candidates and the makeup of platforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tradition in Britain has been for the bosses to control
nominations, while the way of doing it in other places is primary
elections where the people are in charge,'' said Anthony King, a
professor of government at Essex University. ``What they're now
trying to do here without thinking about the consequences is a
hybrid of the authoritarian and the democratic where the bosses end
up intervening ineffectively and the people end up without much of
a say.''
</P>
<P>
   The clash has been catastrophic for both Labor and the
Conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   In Labor's case, the candidate who has emerged on top in the
competition for its nomination is the member of the party that
Blair and government leaders would least like to see representing
them: Ken Livingstone, 54, the last head of the ill-fated Greater
London Council.
</P>
<P>
   Long known as ``Red Ken,'' he comes from the so-called ``loony
left'' of the 1980s that Blair, who likes to call his party New
Labor, faults for having made Labor extremist and unelectable for
years.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Livingstone's mix of populism and impudence may have
marginalized him in national politics, but they have proved to be
assets in London city-style politics, where a little eccentricity
and cheek go a long way. Labor underestimated the importance of
style and personality in direct local elections, and its awkward
maneuvers to block his candidacy and exert central control have
only served to make him more popular still.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Headquarters also failed to persuade Ms. Jackson, 63, a former
minister for transportation in London who entered Parliament in
1992, to bow out and support the party's favored candidate, former
Health Secretary Frank Dobson, 59. Ms. Jackson protested that there
ought to be room for one woman entrant, and she remains in the race
for the Labor nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The Conservatives, as has been their continual fate since losing
power by a landslide in the 1997 national election, failed to
capitalize on Labor's quandary and ended up creating an even deeper
one of their own.
</P>
<P>
   They let Lord Archer, 59, enter the lists without any vetting of
his rumor-haunted past, and they were punished for their lapse when
a 1986 scandal over payments to a prostitute resurfaced and forced
him to resign the nomination he had just won.
</P>
<P>
   The party reopened the nomination process and turned to Steven
Norris, 54, a former member of Parliament with a hearty personality
well suited to big city politics but also with a tabloid past of
his own.
</P>
<P>
   While in the House of Commons, he had five affairs and on
leaving in 1997 wrote a boastful book about it all. He was abruptly
rejected by the local selection committee in favor of four little
known figures, two of them baronesses.
</P>
<P>
   Norris raged against what he called a ``monstrous regiment'' of
``blue rinse'' Tory women whom he blamed for shooting down his bid,
and the Conservatives reinstated him days later as the party's
leading candidate for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing the fanciful way things were going, Malcolm McLaren,
creator of the Sex Pistols, entered the contest as an independent
on a platform of legalizing brothels and marijuana, ending closing
hours in pubs and doing away with entry fees to museums and
galleries.

SPACE TRAVEL IN A LOFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CHRISTOPHER MASON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Clients willing to indulge the futuristic whims of
architects are notoriously rare. But Winka Dubbeldam, a Dutch-born
architect based in Manhattan, seems to have a knack for attracting
patrons susceptible to her visual poetry and her sculptor's passion
for combining natural materials to achieve novel effects. Among her
fans, the famously demanding architect Peter Eisenman called her
``a very talented, highly energetic and motivated person.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She's the pulse of the moment,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Swinging open a pivoting door at the center of a 50-foot-long
wall of translucent glass and steel that tilts at five distinct
angles, spaceship-style, Ms. Dubbeldam said, ``What I do is so
specific, people either love it or hate it.''
</P>
<P>
   She was standing in the exuberantly minimalist Soho pied-a-terre
she designed for Jonathon Carroll, a British art collector, who
recently retired from investment banking at 33. ``As my mum says,
I'm unemployed,'' the Birmingham-born Carroll joked.
</P>
<P>
   A devotee of cutting-edge design, he seemed eager to extol the
beauty of his loft, and its sense of play: the space flows freely
through three distinct areas, kept in flux by moving parts and
transparency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a reaction to the traditional house with chintzy
curtains I grew up in _ the kind of house that still horrifies
me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The apartment occupies the fifth floor of a former warehouse,
built around 1870, which had been unoccupied for a decade when
Carroll moved in last year. He interviewed three architects before
hiring Ms. Dubbeldam, admiring the experimental verve of her
portfolio and her imaginative use of wood, polished plaster, steel,
concrete and glass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only work with natural materials because they have a subtle,
soft effect on the experience of the space,'' Ms. Dubbeldam said,
adding that she developed an affinity for them while studying
sculpture. ``I love the feeling of spaces that are seamless and
fluid, where there's a possibility of transforming the space by
pivoting a table, swiveling a TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Her passion for design was kindled in childhood in Gorinchem, a
seaside town near Rotterdam, where she grew up the daughter of a
government official and a fashion stylist. ``My parents bought a
new house every two years, because my father loved finding new
houses and my mother loved doing the interiors,'' said Ms.
Dubbeldam, a sprightly, handsome woman with expressive hands and
eyes that are apt to twinkle when she speaks of architecture. ``So,
I was always fighting with my brother over who got the best room.''
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by that early sibling rivalry, Ms. Dubbeldam went on to
graduate from the Academy of Architecture in Rotterdam before
moving to New York in 1990 to study at Columbia University. From
there, she worked for two innovative and internationally recognized
architects, Bernard Tschumi and Eisenman, before setting up her own
firm, Archi-Tectonics, in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Fascinated by the challenges of creating sculptural design using
computers, she currently teaches Paperless Studio, a course for
third-year architecture graduates at Columbia University and the
University of Pennsylvania. Her meticulous computer-generated
drawings, and a model for a house in Millbrook, were included in
``The Un-Private House,'' the Museum of Modern Art's critically
acclaimed summer exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dubbeldam has a fascinating way of layering space to create
a sense of peacefulness: few interiors can match the tranquillity
of Carroll's apartment. Stepping from the elevator, visitors first
encounter a wall of soft-gray plaster interrupted at waist level by
a broad horizontal cutaway that offers a peak into an intriguingly
spare, ordered interior.
</P>
<P>
   To obscure an unappealing view, windows at the rear of the loft
were coated with a translucent, removable film that resembles
sandblasted glass, creating the effect of radiant light boxes by
day and providing privacy at night.
</P>
<P>
   Ingeniously configured expanses of translucent glass, steel and
concrete also dominate the new 24,000-square-foot headquarters on
West 23rd Street of Duggal Color Projects, one of the city's
largest photographic and computer imaging companies, which Ms.
Dubbeldam designed for Baldev Duggal, the owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our work is all rush and meeting deadlines, but here, you
still get a feeling of peace,'' Duggal said, contemplating a
sweeping circular steel staircase leading to a new
6,000-square-foot cantilevered mezzanine _ a serene, glass-clad
office space that appears to hover above the busy main floor
``street level.'' Vintage columns form an arcade. The office has
walls of opague glass; clear glass inserts at eye level form a
horizon.
</P>
<P>
   For Carroll, Ms. Dubbeldam produced drawings and models so
inventive and assured that Carroll felt confident about leaving her
to execute his project, monitoring progress from London via e-mail,
fax and weekend visits once a month. ``Winka had to make a lot of
decisions for me,'' he said. ``But she actually made better choices
than I would have made myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Soaring arched windows illuminate the immense main living space,
which encompasses three free-flowing but distinct areas, each
containing movable elements that contribute to an engaging sense of
playfulness, inviting discovery.
</P>
<P>
   In a spacious sisal-carpeted sitting area, floor-to-ceiling
raw-linen curtains can be drawn to create an intimate atmosphere
for lounging in front of a slate fireplace set into a jutting,
right-angled corner. Across the room, a silver flat-screen
television suspended from a vertical pole can be swiveled to
provide entertainment from multiple angles.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, a poured-acrylic see-through breakfast bar,
cantilevered from a tree-trunk column in front of the gleaming
stainless-steel kitchen in the center of the apartment, can be
swiveled from side to side at whim. ``The structural engineer kept
saying, `Are you sure you want this?''' Ms. Dubbeldam recalled. ``I
guess it was a bit new for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly enchanted by all the modernity, Carroll does not seem at
all fazed that his designer has given him a doorless master
bedroom. ``It is possible to have privacy,'' he insisted, dragging
a giant moss-green Ultrasuede curtain around the room to
demonstrate that it can be transformed into a giant cocoon. ``It is
a bedroom, after all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, a suite of more intimately scaled rooms _ a modern
walnut-paneled library, two guest bedrooms and the master bathroom
_ are nestled behind the apartment's signature bulging
steel-and-glass wall. The bathroom, contained in a glass capsule,
is the most spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're naked in the shower and your mum and gran are
sitting out there in the kitchen having breakfast, you obviously
don't want them going, `Oh, my God!''' Carroll said, recalling that
he erred on the side of caution when he and Ms. Dubbeldam
experimented with glass of varying clarity for the wall.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I said it should be more translucent, because it would steam
up when you take a shower,'' Ms. Dubbeldam added mischievously,
noting that they reached a compromise with semiopaque panels that
permit the passage of light but preserve a bather's privacy.
</P>
<P>
   In a striking contrast to the rest of the apartment, where
neutral-toned plaster walls complement artworks by Warhol, Christo
and Hockney, the master bathroom is a riot of vivid, purplish-blue
polished plaster. The floor, washstand, shower and bathtub were
created by pouring a thin warm-to-the-touch layer of concrete,
mixed with prodigious quantities of pigment over custom-built molds
of fiberglass and timber.
</P>
<P>
   The most startling feature is the stainless-steel toilet from
Metcraft, a Missouri-based company that supplies prisons. ``I said
I wanted two, and the guy said, `Two hundred, right?''' Ms.
Dubbeldam recalled, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat alarmingly, the all-metal toilet has no raiseable seat
(to spare inmates the temptation of prying them off to use as
weapons). ``When I explained that to Jonathon, he said, `But it's
going to be cold,''' Ms. Dubbeldam said, grinning. ``So I told him,
`Get used to it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Working with Duggal over the last year on his new headquarters
in Chelsea, Ms. Dubbeldam found herself dealing with a client no
less passionate than Carroll about innovative design, but with an
infinitely more complex and shifting series of spacial
requirements. The challenge was to accommodate under one giant roof
advances in new technology and operations that had sprawled over 12
floors.
</P>
<P>
   At the company's new headquarters, gracious 1880 cast-iron
columns coexist with sleek new forms in an office that is a city
block deep.
</P>
<P>
   ``The columns are the real sculpture of the space,'' Ms.
Dubbeldam said, recalling that all 18 were invisible under multiple
layers of paint, gypsum and grime before Duggal had them stripped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm lucky having Jonathon and D. as clients because they're
like me _ they want everything to look perfect,'' Ms. Dubbeldam
said. She withholds such praise for those who labor at Gear
magazine, whose offices in Chelsea she designed for Bob Guccione,
the publisher, earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the architect, I can't very well say, `Clean this up!'''
Ms. Dubbeldam noted ruefully. On a recent visit, Gear's spacious
blue-and-green river-view offices were strewn with a workaday
assortment of sports equipment, stray files and portable coat
racks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winka thinks we're a bunch of pigs, I guess,'' said Lonnie
Major, the office manager.
</P>
<P>
   To escape the exigencies of her architectural practice, Ms.
Dubbeldam often leaves the city on weekends, driving her 1976
Pacer, with its distinctive oblong hatchback. ``I can't tell you
how much I love it when people in big Mercedes yell, `Love your
car,''' she said. Ambitiously, she is counting on the Pacer to pull
her latest acquisition, a silvery 1967 Airstream.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next,'' she said, ``I want to buy a piece of land so I can
park my Airstream.''
</P>
<P>
   And hopefully, find the time to build a house of her own.

SRI LANKA'S NEWLY RE-ELECTED PRESIDENT VOWS TO DEFEAT REBELS 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka _ Gulping back tears, a white bandage on her
right eye from a bomb attack four days ago, Sri Lanka's president
claimed a divine mandate Wednesday to pursue and defeat the rebels
who had tried to kill her.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the wounds of sheer naked and unadulterated hatred
of man for man,'' she said, her voice quavering. She called for
peace, but she also vowed ``the strongest possible action'' against
the ethnic Tamil separatists if they persisted in their 16-year
insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   It was victory day for President Chandrika Kumaratunga, who won
a second term in office with what, by Sri Lankan standards, was a
tiny electoral majority of 51.2 percent _ just over the 50 percent
needed to win.
</P>
<P>
   That represented a sheer drop from the 62 percent she had won in
1994 with a promise to end the fighting. In a sort of emblem of the
futility of successive government policies, that promise has been
replaced by an aggressive military campaign that was given the name
``war for peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The result has been an upsurge in the fighting and, since early
November, catastrophic government losses of troops and territory in
the northern Jaffna Peninsula, which the rebels claim as a
homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Sri Lanka's war is an ethnic conflict growing out of deep
historical hatreds that have only been sharpened as each side turns
more cruelly on the other in this nation of 18 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Its roots are in British colonial times when the Tamil minority
was favored in education and administrative positions. After
independence in 1948, the 74 percent Sinhalese majority turned
against the Tamils, removing them from positions of influence and
disenfranchizing many of them.
</P>
<P>
   The last 16 years have been marked by ambushes, assassinations
and massacres of entire villages in which the victims have
overwhelmingly been civilians. The war has now taken more than
60,000 lives, made refugees of one in every 18 people and turned
parts of this lovely island nation into a place of unending
bloodshed and deepening despair.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody could be sure, but many now believe that the suicide bomb
attack against Mrs. Kumaratunga at her final election rally on
Saturday gave the president the sympathy vote she needed to win.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi of India in 1991 and
several Sri Lankan leaders before her, Mrs. Kumaratunga, 54,
survived the attack. But at least 24 other people were killed and
scores were wounded when the bomber detonated the explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kumaratunga seemed to find a deep significance in her
survival and the election victory that followed, saying, ``The gods
have seen fit to honor me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This victory is without doubt a very special and portentous
gift of the gods,'' she said, ``for I believe that there now stands
before you the one leader who is the single most qualified to lead
us to the peace we long for.''
</P>
<P>
   But buried in the electoral numbers of her victory was what
seemed to be a warning of harsher divisions in a nation whose
patience with the conflict has worn thin.
</P>
<P>
   Radhika Coomaraswamy, a political analyst with the International
Center for Ethnic Studies, a private policy group, said the
electorate seemed to have become more fractured, potentially
complicating future efforts to find a peaceful resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``What strikes me when I look at the results is the extreme
polarization of the country, the fact that the minority votes
seemed to go quite heavily in favor of the UNP and that the urban
centers seem to have gone heavily in favor of the UNP,'' she said,
using the initials for the opposition United National Party.
</P>
<P>
   This is the party of Ranil Wickremesinghe, who placed second in
the multiparty field with 43 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it is important for Chandrika to realize that this is a
country more and more divided, both along race and class lines,''
Ms. Coomaraswamy said, referring to the president by her first
name.
</P>
<P>
   These are new political divisions that have appeared since the
last election, she said. In particular, Tamils have been feeling
the effects of daily official harassment, suspicion, discrimination
and frequent military and police checkpoints.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an overemphasis on security,'' said D.B.S. Jeyaraj, a
Sri Lankan journalist who follows the insurgency closely. ``A lot
of Tamils are harassed. A lot are arrested and kept without
trial.''
</P>
<P>
   The president seemed to take these issues into account in her
speech Wednesday, in which she condemned ``hatred and its curse and
destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   She urged Tamil citizens to join her in seeking a peaceful
solution and to ``use every ounce of influence'' to bring the
separatist leader, Vellupillai Prabhakaran, to the negotiating
table.
</P>
<P>
   ``I urge you to persuade with every conceivable argument anyone
who is a member or a supporter of the LTTE to renounce violence and
join us in establishing peace,'' she said, using the initials of
the insurgent group, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eeelam.
</P>
<P>
   In a policy that took second place to her aggressive military
campaign, Mrs. Kumaratunga has said she will seek constitutional
changes that would give greater autonomy to regional governments.
</P>
<P>
   This would go part way to meeting the rebel demands by giving
them greater say over the heavily Tamil north and east, where they
have sought to create a separate state.
</P>
<P>
   But the president also sounded a warlike note Wednesday, saying,
``Let all the citizens of this country be warned that this
government will not for one second be deterred from taking the
strongest possible action against anyone who supports terror.''
</P>
<P>
   But strong actions have already been tried and have brought only
further bloodshed, Ms. Coomaraswamy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her strategy has not succeeded; it is a failure,'' she said.
``She has to rethink her policy and she has to rethink it with the
help of the international community. That is absolutely essential.
If she does not do that, there will be disaster here.''

 &HT;     c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Frank Sanchez, a 29-year-old postal carrier, was
screaming.
</P>
<P>
   He clung to a handrail on a warm, Sunday afternoon as a ride at
a San Antonio theme park sent him plummeting to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   It ``really shakes you up'' Sanchez yelled as the Rattler wound
its way through a long, dipping spiral.
</P>
<P>
   Built seven years ago out of Southern yellow pine and Douglas
fir, the Rattler is the flagship roller coaster at Fiesta Texas, a
mountain of timber located near a limestone cliff and a waterfall.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez, rattled but smiling after his encounter with the
towering ride, said he thought the shaking cars were going to
hurtle off the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was rough,'' he said. ``It feels like you're going to be
sore after the ride.''
</P>
<P>
   High speeds, a steep drop and the rough nature of the Rattler
are some of its most attractive features to roller-coaster
enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
   They also are factors that caused dozens of personal injury
lawsuits to be filed against the park, resulting in a $3.5 million
group settlement for 27 plaintiffs in January 1998, lawyers
announced at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Among the documents San Antonio lawyer Randall Jackson came
across during litigation against Fiesta Texas were hundreds of
ambulance reports made during the park's early years.
</P>
<P>
   From 1992 to 1993, Fiesta Texas reported to the state Department
of Insurance that only 13 people were treated for neck and back
injuries on the Rattler and other rides. But the park left out
reports of at least 110 other people who suffered from similar or
more serious injuries. All of them were treated by medical
personnel and transported to hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was dangerous, because they (Fiesta Texas) wanted to set
all these world records and create this extremely scary ride to
attract people to the park,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   The park didn't report the case of a 28-year-old woman with a
possible broken collarbone who ``couldn't remember'' her accident.
Instances of guests suffering unconsciousness and loss of memory
from head injuries went unreported. One teen-age guest who rode the
Rattler simply freaked out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patient states he is scared and doesn't understand why,'' a
paramedic for the park's private ambulance service wrote in his
report.
</P>
<P>
   In other unreported incidents, a paramedic wrote of a
57-year-old Rattler victim: ``(Patient) says she can't walk and it
hurts to stand.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Due to the severity of the injury I was unable to obtain a
statement'' from the patient, wrote another paramedic, who helped
treat a 39-year-old woman.
</P>
<P>
   Several other people who suffered neck injuries said they could
not feel their legs, arms and extremities.
</P>
<P>
   Confusion about what to do with less serious precautionary
transports _ patients who were X-rayed but didn't appear to be
seriously injured _ led Fiesta Texas officials to ask whether such
incidents have to be accounted for.
</P>
<P>
   It was a pertinent question. In all, Fiesta Texas medical
personnel treated 227 people for ride-related injuries during the
park's first two seasons. Almost all of them complained of neck and
back pain.
</P>
<P>
   About 80 patients were precautionary transports, while 30 others
had more serious symptoms. The rest were treated and released at
the park.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is medical treatment?'' asked Phil Villareal, then the
safety manager at Fiesta Texas, during an Aug. 26, 1993, public
hearing in Austin. ``If I give you an X-ray and say you got just a
muscle strain and I give you some Motrin, is that medical
treatment?''
</P>
<P>
   By the time the question was raised, plans already were in the
works to tame the roller coaster. Months later, Fiesta Texas
shortened the Rattler's first drop from 166 to 122 feet, and
authorities decided in October 1994 that precautionary transports
should be reported.
</P>
<P>
   Park officials said the Rattler's modifications were made in
response to guest feedback.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Serff, who came on board as Fiesta Texas' manager in the
summer of 1993, said he couldn't explain the apparent discrepancy
in reporting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure how to answer that,'' said Serff, who is now
president of the Texas Travel Industry Association. ``I'm sure
there was good rationale.''
</P>
<P>
   Villareal, the past safety manager of Fiesta Texas, said the
park complied with state law as far as he remembered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was based on what they required,'' Villareal said. ``That's
about as far as I can tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   A subsidiary of USAA and Nashville-based Opryland originally
owned Fiesta Texas, but Six Flags took over the park in January
1996 in a 10-year lease arrangement. Oklahoma City-based Premier
Parks acquired Six Flags in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone seems to enjoy the Rattler now as they do all of our
other roller-coaster offerings,'' Fiesta Texas spokeswoman Sydne
Purvis said. ``There has been no controversy surrounding it (since
Six Flags took over). It is one of the favorite wooden roller
coasters in existence.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Six Flags bought the park in 1996, 80 people have been
transported from Fiesta Texas to local hospitals, dispatch records
show. During that same period, the park reported 32 injuries to the
Insurance Department _ less than half of all its reported injuries
since the park's opening.
</P>
<P>
   Purvis said Fiesta Texas routinely transports anyone who
requests an ambulance, and not all of the recent injuries occurred
on rides. She declined to provide copies of recent ambulance run
reports with patient names blacked out, saying such records were
proprietary.
</P>
<P>
   Under a practice encouraged by the Insurance Department, Fiesta
Texas doesn't report injuries if guests seek medical treatment on
their own and notify the park later, Purvis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the guest should decide several days later that there is a
problem, and they did not seek out medical attention immediately,
then obviously it's very difficult to track them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say the policy makes sense and applies to all ride
owners. Otherwise, people could claim they suffered injuries at a
park without even being there.

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the procedure isn't foolproof. On May 1, 1998, Lydia
Quiroga, a 23-year-old tortilla maker from Brownsville, cut her
head while on a water ride at Fiesta Texas, court documents allege.
</P>
<P>
   Quiroga went to the first-aid station, where workers told her
how to get to a hospital, said her lawyer, Eddie Lucio of Dallas.
The woman required three stitches and she was later diagnosed with
a dislocated jaw, according to her medical records.
</P>
<P>
   Lucio said Fiesta Texas offered Quiroga a discount pass when she
asked if the park could help pay her medical bills. Quiroga sued.
State authorities have no record of the alleged injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel they were really insensitive,'' Lucio said of Fiesta
Texas. ``There was no feeling of, `Let's help her, let's talk to
her afterward to make sure everything's OK.'''
</P>
<P>
   On July 19, 1997, Jean Accord of Austin was watching the evening
laser show at Fiesta Texas when her 12-year-old son, Michael Garza,
walked up to her in tears.
</P>
<P>
   The boy said he hit his head while riding the Rattler, and
Accord could see some redness on his forehead. But Garza insisted
he was fine and the group of family and friends went back to their
room at the Omni Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   At 3 a.m. the next morning, Garza woke up his mother. There was
a large bump on his forehead and his nose was bleeding, Accord
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he had a really bad headache,'' Accord said in an
interview. ``His pillow was full of blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Garza was diagnosed with two hematomas on his head and a mild
concussion, according to emergency room reports from Brackenridge
Hospital in Austin. Accord took her son to the same hospital a
second time after he began vomiting and complaining of dizziness, a
side effect of some head injuries.
</P>
<P>
   When Garza's mother called Fiesta Texas the day after the
injury, she was continually put on hold and transferred from person
to person, she said. An employee finally talked to her after
several tries. He told her to get a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `We're not going to do anything because there's no
report,''' Accord said of the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Fiesta Texas didn't report the alleged injury to the Insurance
Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't aware of the severity of the injury until hours
later,'' Accord said. ``The physician said this particular injury
wouldn't have shown up right away. I contacted them (Fiesta Texas)
immediately as soon as I found out about it. They kept telling me
there's no injury report.''
</P>
<P>
   Insurance Department spokesman Mark Hanna acknowledged that
injuries go unaccounted for if guests notify the park after the
fact. ``It's hard to keep track of an injury that really doesn't
surface until some time later,'' Hanna said.

 &HT;    Georgia low-key on possible Y2K threat
 &HT;    By Ron Martz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Tight-lipped in the best of times about possible
terrorist activity in Georgia, state and federal officials are
virtually mute about the potential during this holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   Officials here are not saying much about the threat, but what
they are saying appears to be an effort to downplay the national
hysteria building since the arrest in Washington state last week of
a 32-year-old Algerian carrying bomb-making materials in his car.
</P>
<P>
   ``The possibility of terrorism has always been in our Y2K
planning,'' Mary Hudak, spokeswoman for the Federal Emergency
Management Agency's Atlanta office, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   FEMA and the Georgia Emergency Management Agency will begin
staffing their respective operations centers around the clock next
week to monitor and respond to possible problems from the Y2K
computer bug, something that has been in the works for more than a
year.
</P>
<P>
   At Hartsfield International Airport, security will remain at
level 3, where it has been since the 1996 Olympics, said Lanii
Thomas, airport spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   That means curbside parking is prohibited, unattended bags will
be confiscated and passengers are required to present a photo ID at
the ticket counter.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Police Department will have bomb-sniffing dogs at
the airport, ``but we are not at liberty to discuss in detail the
things we are doing behind the scenes to keep the airport and
passengers safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Tanya Wagner, spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation
Administration's Atlanta office, said the federal agency has not
asked airports to increase security in response to the potential
for terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've done is ask airports and the aviation industry as a
whole to be extra diligent in performing those security measures
that are normally in place,'' Wagner said.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Bureau of Investigation spokesman John Bankhead said
Wednesday that every agent will be on duty or on alert over the
holidays, ``but that's what has been planned for some time. This is
not a reaction to things that happened out west.''
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia State Patrol and local law enforcement agencies also
will beef up staffing shortly after Christmas, but that also was
planned as a response to Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Finke, a senior security consultant with IPSA International,
Inc. in Atlanta, said Americans should be particularly vigilant
this holiday season because of the recent arrest in Washington and
repeated threats against the United States by terrorist leader
Osama bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   Americans tend to let down their guard during the holidays and
might be more inclined to do so as 1999 becomes 2000, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unfortunate part about our country is we have a
target-rich environment and we can't protect it all. Terrorists say
law enforcement and security experts have to be lucky all the time.
Terrorists only have to be lucky once,'' Finke said.
</P>
<P>
   Celestine Armstead, spokeswoman for the Atlanta office of the
FBI, would not say if additional agents are being called to duty
because of the increased threat from terrorism or Y2K. ``We're
going to be adequately staffed to address the situation,'' Armstead
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Ken Baldowski, spokesman for the Georgia National
Guard, said no special precautions are being made beyond what is in
place for Y2K and problems it may cause.
</P>
<P>
   He also pointed out that a 22-member unit that specializes in
assisting after terrorist attacks involving weapons of mass
destruction is now in place at Dobbins Air Reserve Base. Known as
the 4th Military Support Detachment, the unit would be called in to
identify what explosives or toxic agents were used and then request
assistance from the appropriate federal and state agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Baldowski said the unit will not be on any higher state of alert
over the holidays. ``No more than they normally are. Their people
can be gathered very, very quickly,'' he said.

 &HT;    Privacy issues raised over Internet campaign fund lists
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The Texas Ethics Commission is churning, slowly,
toward allowing Texans to use the Internet to see who's giving to
state political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   But the law requiring Internet publication, in the name of
privacy, forbids the Ethics Commission from including home
addresses of donors on the Web site version of the reports. That
information still would be available on paper reports filed at the
Ethics Commission headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the law, passed earlier this year, say a list without
addresses is not much of a list. They are trying to make sure that
computer diskettes available for purchase from the agency will
include addresses. The Ethics Commission has asked Attorney General
John Cornyn to decide that issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without addresses it is impossible to know whether
contributions to a candidate from a Bob Smith and a B. Smith from
downtown Houston are from the same person,'' Fred Lewis, executive
director of Campaigns for People, an Austin nonprofit group that
pushes for open government. told Cornyn in a legal brief. ``It
becomes even more difficult when there are B. Smiths, R. Smiths,
R.E. Smiths, Bobby Smiths, Bob Smiths and Robert Smiths giving to
hundreds of political action committees and candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas will join 31 states that have at least some portions of
the reports posted on web sites. Another 11 states have systems in
the works.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Holman of the California-based Center for Governmental
Studies said Texas has done a good thing by going to Internet
posting of campaign finance reports. But Holman said Texas but did
a bad thing by deleting addresses from the reports. Very few states
(California is one) have deleted addresses from the reports on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most states put the same information up on web sites that they
put on paper,'' he said, adding that the argument against including
addresses is based on protecting donors from commercial and
political solicitations. ``I don't consider that a good reason not
to publish addresses on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The skirmish over donors' home addresses is the latest front in
the computer-age battle between privacy and disclosure. Until the
evolution of cyberspace, public records generally were sheets of
paper available only to people willing to make a trip to the
Capitol, the courthouse or city hall. The records were public, but
required an effort to procure.
</P>
<P>
   Now, thanks to the Internet, people with a computer and a modem
can quickly find out things like the appraised value of their
neighbors' homes or lawsuits involving their in-laws.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Texas law, sponsored by Austin Rep. Sherri Greenberg,
addresses ``must remain available on the report maintained in the
commission's office but may not be available electronically at that
office.''
</P>
<P>
   The question pending with Cornyn is whether addresses will be
included on computer diskette versions of the reports that the
Ethics Commission must make available ``at a reasonable cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis argues that the section of the law that says donors'
addresses ``may not be available electronically'' at the Ethics
Commission office does not apply to computer diskettes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A computer diskette is not itself electronic. It does not use
electricity and is not an electronic device,'' Lewis wrote in his
brief to Cornyn.
</P>
<P>
   Suzy Woodford of Common Cause fears that the law, intended to
help Texans get a clear idea of whose money is behind candidates,
could become a step backward if Cornyn rules that the diskette
versions of the list do not have to include addresses.
</P>
<P>
   Woodford's organization, in the name of privacy, supported the
effort to keep donors' addresses off the Internet version of the
reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are crazies out there ... ,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Woodford believes home addresses should be on the diskette
version. And she fears that a Cornyn ruling to the contrary could
inspire some lawmakers to take a shot at removing addresses from
all versions of the reports, including the paper ones available for
scrutiny at the agency office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see this as the beginning of going down a slippery slope,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   While awaiting Cornyn's ruling on its request for an opinion on
the diskette question, the Ethics Commission is moving forward with
its plans for electronic dissemination. The agency recently signed
a $525,000 contract with California-based SDR Technologies Inc. to
develop the software for the electronic reports. The reports are
expected to be available on the Internet in July.
</P>
<P>
   The law requires the reports to be in a format that allows the
data to be exported into spreadsheets.
</P>
<P>
   But any version of the reports without donors' addresses are of
questionable value, according to Lewis. In Texas, where there is no
limit on the generosity of political donors, disclosure is the only
way ``to regulate campaigns and special influence,'' he told
Cornyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas already makes it difficult to identify contributors (and
the special interests they represent) by not requiring contributors
to list their employer and occupation,'' Lewis told Cornyn.
``Taking away addresses will make the task virtually impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   And because addresses are so crucial, they also become quite
valuable. Currently, companies that make a buck by compiling
mailing lists of politically active Texans spend hours looking at
the paper reports and copying the names and addresses line by line.
</P>
<P>
   Making those lists available on computer diskettes could make
their jobs easier, but it also could make their product much less
valuable.

IF THIS IS BROOKLYN, WHY EVER LEAVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Dec. 26) 
(jt) 
 By SARAH FERRELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There is something that feels a little illicit about
checking into a neighborhood hotel for a weekend, even if the man
you are checking in with is your own husband. But we can see a bit
of the building that contains the New York Marriott Brooklyn from
the back of our house, and we are curious.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Marriott Brooklyn is installed in the first 7
floors of a 32-floor mixed-use building in downtown Brooklyn on a
busy street that feeds into the Brooklyn Bridge, behind the Supreme
Court building. It is part of the much-heralded Brooklyn
renaissance, of which the chief manifestation is the huge Metrotech
complex of offices and banks and brokerage firms. The top floors,
which are offices, have the views.
</P>
<P>
   The entrance is modest _ in fact, easy to miss if you don't know
that it's there. Beyond the revolving doors, short escalators,
lined with green plants, lead to (and from) the reception area,
under a trompe l'oeil dome, through which a prettily painted
cloud-streaked blue sky is visible.
</P>
<P>
   We arrive at the same time as a Swissair crew, which answers one
of our points of curiosity, to wit: Who stays in a hotel in
downtown Brooklyn? More than a few people who look like tourists
are milling around and, later, in the elevator, we shall see a
charming young couple who cannot be anything other than
honeymooners.
</P>
<P>
   Having crammed a whole weekend's worth of errands into a few
hours, we are ready for rest-and-recreation when we check in at 4
p.m. This leaves us just time to drop our bag in our room (of which
more later) and rush off, before we lose momentum, to the movies,
specifically to Jean Renoir's ``Grand Illusion,'' which is playing
at the nearby Brooklyn Academy of Music Rose Cinemas. These
theaters are another recent Brooklyn development, having opened a
little more than a year ago, about the same time as the Marriott.
</P>
<P>
   We have not been to the Rose Cinemas before, and discover one of
many examples of the old made new, or put to new uses, that abound
in our borough. ``Grand Illusion,'' in a print made from a pristine
negative, is showing in Cinema 3, one of four spaces that now
occupy a former single auditorium. The theater is up in the eaves,
on a newly carved out second floor, so the decorative garlands and
bosses of the ceiling are within easy reach; the large screen is
framed by the top of the former proscenium arch. It is odd, but not
unpleasing, and the new print of the movie brings out details I've
never seen before. (I still cry in all the same places.) The
adjacent BAM Opera House remains as it was, a splendid
neo-Classical space given over to Baroque opera and avant-garde
dance and all points in between.
</P>
<P>
   We have made a dinner date with friends at Gage &AMP; Tollner, a
landmark establishment (inside and out) on Fulton Street, a
two-minute walk from the hotel. The restaurant, which opened in
1879 and has retained its opulent decor of polished brass and
mirrors and lincrusta, deals largely in seafood, as evidenced by
the display of bright-eyed specimens on ice just inside the door.
It is a festive evening, with gaslights flickering romantically and
choruses of ``Happy Birthday'' erupting from three separate tables.
The standout dish is the she-crab soup, although the baked trout
gives it a run for its money; the crab cakes are widely approved.
There is an elaborate presentation of desserts, but no one has room
for one. We sit around and chat for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the hotel, we examine our environment. The sixth-floor
room is spacious with big windows looking out on a shallow light
well. (The lack of a view comes as no surprise; we have long known
that the plutocrats and bureaucrats on the top floors had a
monopoly.) The restrained pattern of the valence matches the spread
on the king-size bed, an enormous cabinet houses a minibar,
television screen and drawers, there are heaps of thick white
towels in the bathroom and all the other comforts of a major chain.
The best amenities are four really big pillows on the bed, and two
more in the ample closet _ enough to build a comfortable nest for
reading in bed. And, among the bathroom goodies, the best sewing
kit ever, including six colors of thread threaded into six needles.
Local color consists of prints of the Brooklyn Bridge, a Brooklyn
map and calendar of events and a copy of Brooklyn Bridge magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday morning brings a room-service breakfast, ordered the
night before and delivered, at an advanced hour, exactly when
promised. This is my idea of a total treat _ not only the food,
which in this instance is just fine, but also the accouterments:
the tiny pots of jams and syrups, the silver dish covers and
coffeepots, the pretty china on the pretty flowered tablecloth on
the table that is rolled in on silent wheels. Every day should
start like this.
</P>
<P>
   Tom realizes that he has forgotten to water the houseplants, and
returns home to do so, which allows me more time to loll
luxuriously with the Sunday papers.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On his return, we set off for a little walk through the weirdly
silent business district. The new buildings of Metrotech Center,
many of which serve as back offices for Wall Street, are abandoned;
the people with suits and cell phones have gone elsewhere for the
weekend. But businesses geared to the indigenes are open, and we
spend some happy minutes in Sid's hardware store, which has acres
of everything from plastic lawn flamingos to serious plumbing
supplies. A friend says the old Sid's, a labyrinth of tunnels and
secret passages, was better, but we are happy with the new one.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown Brooklyn has more than its share of architectural
eccentricities, and one of the most startling is just next door to
Sid's, on Jay Street. It is a former firehouse, built in 1906,
which is, well, sort of a terra-cotta Byzantine high-rise. It is in
scaffolding for the moment, but you can get a good view from across
the street. Some of our other favorites, which we pass on our
stroll, are the Macy's (formerly Abraham &AMP; Straus) on Fulton Street
_ downtown's main drag and here the pedestrianized Fulton Mall _
with its splendid Art Deco elevator banks and, perhaps oddest of
all, the Dime Savings Bank of New York, just off Fulton on DeKalb.
The bank, a Beaux-Arts Greek temple on a grand scale, is built on
an irregularly shaped piece of land, so that its facade is narrower
than the rest of it. Look at it dead-on, and you may believe that
something has gone wrong with your peripheral vision. Inside (it is
closed on Sunday, of course, but worth a visit on any other day),
you may well believe that you mind has gone funny. The giant dome,
supported by marble Corinthian columns inset with truly giant
silver-leafed dimes, is stupefying.
</P>
<P>
   But we have not planned on going to the bank, even if it were
open. A little farther down DeKalb is Junior's, a delicatessen,
bakery and restaurant whose cheesecake is the stuff of song and
story. Junior's, which opened in 1950, is in its third generation
of family ownership; that its founder, Harry Rosen, lived to be 92
is all the proof that you should need that cheesecake is good for
you. All of which is by way of preface to our settling down at the
counter, which, like all the tables, is decked with bowls of many
kinds of pickles and other condiments that go with the giant
sandwiches, and ordering slabs of the gorgeous substance. Neither
of us is able to finish _ portions at Junior's are huge, and when
the menu lists things like Mountain High Sundaes and Skyscraper Ice
Cream Sodas it isn't kidding.
</P>
<P>
   We had planned an excursion to Brooklyn's cultural center _ the
Brooklyn Museum of Art, the Brooklyn Botanic Garden and the
charming little Prospect Park Zoo, all a short subway ride away,
but the afternoon has suddenly become late, and, probably because
of the cheesecake, we could do with a nap before dinner. Rest is
winning out over recreation.
</P>
<P>
   Returning up DeKalb, we drop into the Gallery at Metrotech,
which is roughly opposite the Dime Savings Bank. The Gallery is a
complex of shops and fast-food restaurants (with a separate
entrance to a Toys ``R'' Us that is chaos at Christmas time); the
businesses inside are much like other downtown businesses, small,
for the most part, and given to inexpensive jewelry and sneakers
and CD's. But on the lower level is Albee Square Religious, a
wonderful place to browse, where you can buy, among other things,
choir robes (some trimmed with kente cloth), Madonna-and-Child
statues both black and white, Bibles, crystal balls, incense and
aerosol sprays labeled ``Go Away Evil'' or ``Money House
Blessing.'' A spiritual adviser has premises in the rear.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the Marriott, which now feels like home, we tidy up for
dinner, then go down to the bar. Although there are comfy chairs
and banquettes, we prefer to sit with our elbows on the black
marble top of the bar itself, a rectangular island supported by
carved Ionic columns at each corner, with an
island-within-an-island stacked with exotic bottles and a
glistening copper espresso machine. The drinks are large and tasty,
and mixed and presented with such panache that we order seconds to
enjoy the show. (It's not as if we have to drive, or even walk,
anywhere farther than the elevators.) On the way into the dining
room, the Archives Restaurant, we examine memorabilia on loan from
the Brooklyn Historical Society; five vitrines devoted to the
Dodgers, the Navy Yard, Coney Island, Brooklynites and the Brooklyn
Bridge, respectively. We experience a warm glow of civic pride.
</P>
<P>
   People have dressed up for Sunday dinner in the dining room.
Unlike Junior's or even Gage &AMP; Tollner's customers, most men are in
jackets and ties. A large family party, headed by a clergyman, is
particularly notable for its decorum. The room is pleasant without
being distinctive, the food is a cut or two up from standard hotel
fare and the service is solicitous without being annoying. Tom has
the Australian lamb chops with mashed Yukon gold potatoes and
rosemary merlot essence; I have the Black Angus filet mignon with
baked potato and asparagus. Not adventurous choices, but cooked as
ordered and succulent. We choose a California zinfandel by Chateau
Souverain from the fairly priced list, and drink it with pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Monday morning dawns as, well, Monday morning. We make ourselves
tea and coffee from the in-room supplies and check out. The streets
are bustling, the suits and cell phones are back in force, and it's
time to get on the subway and turn ourselves in to our own offices.
</P>
<P>
   Treats for mind, body and spirit

BONDS MIXED AS REVISIONS IN GROWTH NUMBERS HAVE LITTLE EFFECT 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Treasury securities were mixed Wednesday, as the government's
auction of $15 million of two-year notes weighed on the bond
market.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said the market largely ignored the unexpected upward
revision to third-quarter growth because those numbers seemed like
very old news.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the attention was on whether there would be any
interest in the two-year auction. The Dec. 31 settlement date on
the notes was expected to discourage many investors concerned about
year 2000 problems from participating in the note sale. Problems
associated with the settlement date were probably priced in, some
traders said.
</P>
<P>
   The 6[ percent coupon rate at auction matched that of an
outstanding five-year maturity originally issued Dec. 31, 1996. Its
yield at auction was 6.233 percent, the highest since 6.328 at the
May 1997 auction more than two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   By late in the day, the 30-year Treasury bond was up 2/32, to 95
23/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to
6.45 percent from 6.46 percent on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the session, the government reported that third-quarter
gross domestic product was revised upward to 5.7 percent from the
5.5 percent reported last month. Even though the market reacted
little to the change, the data provided more evidence of the
economy's strength.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management,
said that, as expected, the Federal Open Market Committee kept
monetary policy unchanged at its December meeting on Tuesday ``in
order to minimize market gyrations during the Y2K transition
period, but despite its officially stated neutral bias, the Fed is
aware of the inflation risks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Further pre-emptive tightening is widely anticipated during
the first quarter of next year in the absence of any evidence
pointing to a slackening of economic growth to a noninflationary
pace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With the Fed poised to raise rates again in the first quarter,
some investors might have been reluctant to buy into the auction of
two-year notes, which are among the most sensitive to changes in
Fed rate policy.
</P>
<P>
   Demand was weaker than at the last auction, judging by the
bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by comparing the number of
bids with the amount of securities sold. The bid to cover was
2.10-1, down from 2.46-1 at the sale on Nov. 23. For the last six
auctions the average ratio has been 2.23-1.
</P>
<P>
   Still, after the recent rise in yields, some investors found the
securities attractive. In the last month, two-year yields have
climbed the most of all Treasury securities due in more than one
year.

 &HT;    Jaguars, Ravens pack Pro Bowl picks
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   With two of the best records in the NFL, the Jacksonville
Jaguars and St. Louis Rams are popular picks to play in Super Bowl
XXXIV in the Georgia Dome on Jan. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Both of those teams also will be well represented in the Feb. 6
Pro Bowl in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars, who have the league's best record at 13-1, placed
an NFL-high seven players on the AFC all-star squad. Baltimore
placed five players on the team, with Oakland and Tennessee sending
four apiece.
</P>
<P>
   In the NFC, the Rams and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers each had six
players selected to the team. Dallas, Detroit and Minnesota each
had five players voted to the squad.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons, who had six players in the game after last season's
improbable flight to the Super Bowl, failed to have anyone selected
this year.
</P>
<P>
   The 42-man rosters were chosen by a combination of voting by
fans, coaches and players. A 43rd ``need'' player, chosen by each
team's head coach, must be a linebacker or a defensive end.
</P>
<P>
   Fan voting counted as one-third of the total, and each NFL team
had two equal votes, those of the coach and a consensus vote of the
players. No one was permitted to choose a player on his own team.
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville wide receiver Jimmy Smith, offensive tackle Tony
Boselli, defensive end Tony Brackens, outside linebacker Kevin
Hardy and free safety Carnell Lake all were chosen as starters.
</P>
<P>
   Jaguars quarterback Mark Brunell is a backup to Indianapolis'
Peyton Manning, who was voted the AFC starter in only his second
season. Colts receiver Marvin Harrison and rookie running back
Edgerrin James also were chosen first-time starters.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee's Jevon Kearse, who leads the AFC with 13 1/2 sacks,
became the first AFC rookie defensive end named to the team since
the AFL-NFL merger in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams had six players voted NFC starters _ quarterback Kurt
Warner, receiver Isaac Bruce, running back Marshall Faulk,
offensive tackle Orlando Pace, defensive end Kevin Carter and
cornerback Todd Lyght.
</P>
<P>
   The Buccaneers, who have a one-game lead over Detroit in the NFC
Central, had five players voted starters. Defensive tackle Warren
Sapp, linebackers Derrick Brooks and Hardy Nickerson and strong
safety John Lynch all were chosen on defense. The Bucs' Mike
Alstott is the starting fullback.

`A COACH'S LIFE': INSIGHT BUT LITTLE CONTROVERSY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Kan.)  (Eds: Publication notes at end of review)  
(rk) 
 By BEN STEELMAN   
 Wilmington (N.C.) Morning Star   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dean Smith has coached in the Olympics, won two national titles,
broken Adolph Rupp's record of games won and had a sports temple,
``the Dean Dome,'' named in his honor at the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill. Now, he has produced a book called ``A
Coach's Life.''
</P>
<P>
   No, Dean Smith did not invent basketball, although the
connection's close; at the University of Kansas, young Dean played
for Phog Allen, who had played for James Naismith himself.
(Actually, Smith writes, ``Doc'' Allen was starting to get ``a
little absent-minded by the early 1950s, and his assistant, Dick
Harp may have been a greater influence.)
</P>
<P>
   And yes, once upon a time, they did burn Dean Smith in effigy at
Chapel Hill. That was back in 1964, when the Tar Heels _ still
reeling from the effects of NCAA sanctions and the scandals that
led to the abolition of the Dixie Classic Tournament _ ended the
season 12-12 and in fifth place in the Atlantic Coast Conference.
Thereafter, Carolina never finished lower than third in the ACC;
the last time it won fewer than 20 games was in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Coach's Life'' tells the story of that remarkable dynasty
from the point of view of the coach's bench.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan, plays a big part, of course. (Smith confirms the
account of his recruiting in David Halberstam's recent book, and
gives assistants Roy Williams and Eddie Fogler full credit for
scouting the young prospect.)
</P>
<P>
   But there are other names, too. What's remarkable, in fact, has
been the postgraduate record of North Carolina teams. Many players
and coaching assistants went on to become leaders themselves in the
NCAA and pro ranks, such as Roy Williams at Kansas, Eddie Fogler at
South Carolina, George Karl with the Milwaukee Bucks or Mitch
Kupchack, the general manager of the L.A. Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   And the roster of Smith's All-Americans also includes dozens of
doctors, lawyers, pastors, career military officers, teachers and a
chairman of Chase Manhattan Corp. (Bill Harrison, '66).
</P>
<P>
   Dean Smith not only taught his players to be champs; somehow, he
also taught them to be gentlemen. Even their peccadilloes, such as
Phil Ford's recent DWI, pale beside the outrages that seem routine
these days in the pro and college ranks.
</P>
<P>
   How did he do it? The secret seems to lie in Emporia, Kan.,
where young Dean grew up until his sophomore year. A small prairie
town, Emporia was once known as the home of William Allen White,
the local editor, who was still a nationally respected commentator
when young Dean reached high school. Smith calls himself a Democrat
now, but his principles seem close to White's version of
progressive Republicanism.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, he was the son of schoolteachers and devout
American (Northern) Baptists. His dad, Alfred Smith, the Emporia
high school coach, showed him how to dress down a player without
cursing; more to the point, he put a black player on his team in
the depths of the Depression, despite grumblings that could have
threatened his job.
</P>
<P>
   Smith points out that he did not desegregate the ACC; Maryland
fielded blacks several seasons before he did. Yet he recruited
Charlie Scott when it was still controversial to do so, and his
outspoken promotion of racial harmony undoubtedly helped the whole
state, not just in sports.
</P>
<P>
   While he studied and learned from many coaches, his chief
influences were undoubtedly Dick Harp, who helped introduce the
pressure defense at Kansas, and Bob Spear, his boss when Smith was
assistant coach at the Air Force Academy. Hemmed in by height
restrictions _ no cadet could be taller than 6-foot-4 _ and
shortened practice times, Spear focused on team-play strategies
that could neutralize an opponent's stars. Smith would evolve his
ideas into such mutant monsters as the Four Corners.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Coach's Life'' plays with one disadvantage; Smith clearly
believes that if you can't say something nice, don't say anything.
He still defends his old boss, Frank McGuire against charges of
recruiting violations; the worst he'll accuse him of is sloppy
expense reporting. He even says nice things about his ex-wife _ and
the summary of his failed first marriage in one paragraph tells you
how carefully this gentleman guards his privacy.

OLYMPIC GAMES COSTLY FOR THE U.S., REPORT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal report released Tuesday found that the
staging of Olympic Games in the United States, which is widely
viewed as financed by corporate sponsors, also costs the federal
government hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that $200 million in federal money would be
spent for the 2002 Winter Olympic Games in Salt Lake City ``for
safety- and security-related services, which would not have been
used for this purpose if the Games were not being hosted there.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitt Romney, president of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee,
said when asked about the report, ``My guess is that $400 million
to $500 million in federal funds will be spent for projects that
are exclusively Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   Romney said that half of that would go toward anti-terrorism
activities conducted by the Justice Department and half to
transportation and highways. ``Half a billion dollars is a lot of
money, but it is money well spent,'' Romney said. ``The Olympics
are a great symbol of peace on the world stage and good business
for the hosting country.''
</P>
<P>
   Lower but substantial amounts of federal money were spent at the
1984 Summer Games in Los Angeles and the 1996 Summer Games in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The study was conducted by the General Accounting Office, the
principal investigative agency of Congress, and was limited to
federal money, excluding whatever is spent by state and local
governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certainly state and municipal funds that must go
into infrastructure,'' said Dennis Fitzgibbons, a congressional
aide who made the report available. ``Many Olympics projects do not
qualify for federal dollars. We do not have a good accounting on
how much state and municipal spending there is.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgibbons is deputy staff director for the minority Democrats
on the House Commerce Committee. The ranking Democrat on that
committee, Rep. John D. Dingell of Michigan, asked for the study
last January following reports of abuses and gift-taking by Olympic
officials.
</P>
<P>
   It was given a bipartisan tone when Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,
joined the request. He is chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science
and Transportation Committee.
</P>
<P>
   When Dingell requested the study, he said: ``I am fully aware
that the Olympics are generally considered a
private-sector-financed endeavor. Nevertheless, the level of
federal funds that must be used to support a host city is
formidable.''
</P>
<P>
   In releasing the study Tuesday, Dingell said that the award of
the Olympics to a city has become ``the impetus for massive amounts
of federal largesse,'' although ``there has been no conscious
decision by the taxpayers or their representatives to spend the
money on the Games.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That needs to change, especially when the taxpayers' tab for
the Salt Lake Games may approach almost $2 billion, according to
the GAO,'' Dingell said. ``This is an amount far in excess of
previous estimates.''
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman for the U.S. Olympic Committee, Mike Moran, said
in Colorado Springs: ``The cost of the Games has been borne in this
country by the private sector. Nobody's tried to hide the federal
money. The government commitment has always been known.'' The $2
billion that Dingell referred to includes $1.1 billion that would
eventually have been provided to Utah even if the Olympics were not
held there.

THREATS BRING ORDER TO CLOSE UN NEW YEAR'S EVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE LAURIA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ ``Credible'' terrorist threats prompted UN
officials Wednesday to order the closing of their headquarters on
New Year's Eve, in what is believed to be the first shutdown of the
massive complex in midtown Manhattan in decades.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to close the headquarters was announced to
reporters during a day of high-level security meetings here.
</P>
<P>
   One official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said UN
headquarters routinely receives threats, but most are dismissed as
hoaxes. He refused to provide details but said the latest threats
were ``credible'' and being taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the FBI has sent an intelligence report to thousands
of state and local police describing apocalyptic groups who
``advocate or call for violent action beginning in the year 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Included in these groups are ``radical elements of private
citizen militias who fear that the United Nations will initiate an
armed takeover of the United States and subsequently establish a
One World Government,'' the FBI says.
</P>
<P>
   The UN's chief of security, Michael McCann, said officially that
there is no terrorist threat from any US militia group or any other
source against the building at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   However, the other UN official said security has decided not to
disclose what have been described as the most serious threats
against the UN complex since February 1997, when a letter bomb was
intercepted by UN security before it reached a Lebanese journalist
based here.
</P>
<P>
   Three years earlier, then-Secretary General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali ordered sandbags placed in an underground garage and
restricted visitors to UN headquarters after federal authorities
uncovered a plot by Islamic militants to blow up several New York
landmarks, including UN headquarters, in the wake of the World
Trade Center bombing. Since then, the United Nations has installed
metal detectors at the staff entrance and a new high-security gate
at the vehicle entrance.
</P>
<P>
   McCann said additional security will be added to the building,
which will be closed on 1 p.m. on Dec. 31. It will reopen to
non-essential staff Jan. 4 at the earliest, a UN official said. It
is the first time in memory that UN headquarters was closed to all
but essential staff because of a potential security threat, said
McCann.
</P>
<P>
   He said New York City police, as part of their heightened
anti-terrorist alert throughout the city, would provide additional
security in front of the First Avenue headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   McCann took the unusual step of asking reporters to cooperate
with security measures by reporting any suspicious person or
object.

NAYA, THE BOTTLER OF SPRING WATER, SEEKS BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Naya Inc., the bottler of spring water, has filed for bankruptcy
protection in Canada, in a reversal of the stellar rise that had
much to do with its having once been distributed by Coca-Cola Co.'s
largest bottler.
</P>
<P>
   Naya's president, Stu Levitan, said Wednesday that the company,
which is based in Mirabel, Quebec, would continue to fill orders
while it reorganizes. It filed for protection from creditors on
Dec. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Until May, about 65 percent of Naya's bottled water had been
distributed by Coca-Cola Enterprises, which gave it access to
stores and other outlets across the United States and Canada. When
Coca-Cola introduced its own bottled water, Dasani, this year, the
bottler stopped carrying Naya after six months, although in many
markets it still offers Evian, a French spring water sold by Danone
SA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to embark on a new system of distribution in the U.S.
and Canada,'' Levitan said, noting that the company now uses a
combination of direct-store delivery and retail warehouse delivery.
``It took a lot of money to get this thing seeded, and financing
didn't happen as fast as we thought it would.''
</P>
<P>
   A receiver has been appointed by Canadian bankruptcy regulators,
said Anita Jarjour, a Naya spokeswoman. While the changeover to the
new distribution network has gone well, she said, ``we still have
some work to do, and that's why we found ourselves in this
position.''
</P>
<P>
   The privately held Naya entered the bottled-water market about
five years ago with a catchy slogan _ ``Hungry for life, thirsty
for Naya'' _ a hot product and the additional advantage of plugging
into the Coca-Cola system. It grew about 30 percent a year,
becoming emblematic of the surge in sales of single-serve bottled
water that began in the early 1990s. Naya was so successful that in
1997, Coca-Cola Enterprises tried unsuccessfully to buy the
company.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Naya ran advertisements in industry publications
thanking Coca-Cola Enterprises for its help over the last five
years and proclaiming that it had been ``a great relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Other ads took shots at Dasani, suggesting that because it was
not a spring water _ it is filtered tap water, with added minerals
_ Coca-Cola was ``emphasizing cost savings over quality.''
</P>
<P>
   One industry expert said the loss of Coca-Cola Enterprises as a
distributor would set any company back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naya probably stood to lose at least 30 percent of its
volume,'' said John D. Sicher, the editor of Beverage Digest, an
industry newsletter. ``That probably changed the entire financial
dynamic of the company.''

 &HT;    DEA agents seize $26 million, infiltrate drug ring by posing as
stockbrokers
 &HT;    By R. Robin McDonald
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For three years, agents with the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration and the Internal Revenue Service masqueraded as
stockbrokers who were willing to wink at the law to launder
millions of dollars in illicit drug profits.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, as federal agents froze bank accounts across the
globe, the DEA and the IRS announced the results of the
investigation _ which has led to the seizure of an estimated $26.2
million in U.S. currency, 4 tons of cocaine and 340 bank accounts
used by Colombian drug traffickers and the money brokers who
converted their illegal earnings into legitimate profits.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation has also led to the arrest of 47 people in
nine U.S. cities and two foreign countries. Thirteen others remain
at large, including five Colombian money brokers whom federal
investigators have identified as men who also traffic in illegal
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Those five men _ two from Pereira, Colombia, one from Bogota and
two from Medellin _ have been indicted by a federal grand jury in
Atlanta and warrants have been issued for their arrests. Several
have ties to the Cali drug cartel, federal investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities said Wednesday they intend to seek
extradition of the five to this country for prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defendants in this case took millions of dollars in U.S.
money and took millions in pesos and laundered them without the
money ever leaving this country,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney
Larry Anderson, who will prosecute the case.
</P>
<P>
   The three-year investigation began in September 1996 when DEA
agents discovered nearly 400 kilos of cocaine in a shipment of fish
destined for Spain, said John J. Andrejko, special agent in charge
of the DEA's Atlanta field division.
</P>
<P>
   The firm that exported the fish was a subsidiary of Colapia USA,
which maintained its small corporate office in Marietta, Ga., and
housed its shipping operations in a central warehouse in Doraville,
Ga., Andrejko said. One of the firm's owners was later convicted in
Miami of laundering $42 million for Colombian drug lords, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the investigation unfolded, the DEA in Atlanta was able to
infiltrate part of that Colombian drug trafficking organization,''
Andrejko said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to learn that the Colombian traffickers
responsible for that shipment were also looking for new customers
for drugs, people interested in going in as partners and people
able to move and launder their drug proceeds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made it known we could provide all those services.''
</P>
<P>
   The DEA did so by establishing a licensed stock brokerage in
Tucker, Ga., in a secluded office park on Northlake Parkway,
Andrejko said. It marked the first time that federal agents have
used a legitimate stock brokerage as a prop for a drug
investigation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Through that brokerage, known as Airmark Investments, DEA and
IRS agents targeted the black market peso exchange, where Columbian
money brokers buy, sell or trade foreign currency at exchange rates
as much as 16 percent higher than legitimate banks, said DEA
spokesman Bill Malarney.
</P>
<P>
   Those black market peso brokers, he said, are often willing to
launder drug money for Colombia drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   At Airmark, ``We had the authority to do trades,'' said Albert
``Skip'' Latson, a veteran of other money laundering stings who
supervised this investigation, code-named ``Operation Juno'' for
the Roman goddess whose temple minted Roman coins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were only offering services to our clients, not to the
general public. We found, once we started it, they weren't too
concerned about investing or buying stock. ... Their primary reason
was that they were already making about 400 percent on their
(cocaine) investment.''
</P>
<P>
   Illegal drug sales, according to U.S. Customs, generate an
estimated $57 billion annually, almost all of it in cash. But
strict federal cash reporting laws have made it difficult for drug
dealers to deposit dirty cash _ profits from illegal drug sales _
at a U.S. bank without arousing suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   So drug traffickers have to find other ways of retrieving the
cash from their foreign drug transactions without alerting federal
authorities who can, by law, seize money generated through crime.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them have turned to the black market peso exchange, said
Andre Martin, special agent in charge of the criminal division of
the IRS in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Drug traffickers will contact a peso broker, who may do business
with both legitimate and illegitimate enterprises. The broker, for
a hefty fee, will transfer Colombian pesos to a Colombian drug
trafficker. In return, the peso broker will have access to sacks of
cash in a U.S. or European city _ the actual profits from drug
sales.
</P>
<P>
   But the money broker needs a way to legitimize those cash
assets. That's the role the Tucker stock brokerage played, Andrejko
said. Only because it was a federal sting operation did federal
authorities know that the firm's gross revenues were actually
suitcases full of drug money, rather than cash entrusted to Airmark
by legitimate investors.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, hundreds of otherwise legitimate business owners may
easily become accomplices who, wittingly or unwittingly, help drug
traffickers wash their dirty money, Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   When Colombian importers place orders for American goods, they
will often make cash payments to a peso broker. But rather than
wire the cash from a legitimate bank account in Colombia, the
broker will pay for the foreign goods or merchandise through third
parties that are either sham operations that have no ties to the
importers, such as the Tucker stock brokerage, or whose owners are
willing take in suitcases full of cash and report it as legitimate
profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The drug proceeds are so massive it boggles the mind,'' Latson
said. ``We had offers for $20 million at a time. ... Our system for
doing it was to launder as little as possible for the maximum
enforcement benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   No actual cash pickups occurred in Atlanta or at the brokerage,
Andrejko said. But it was manned by agents well-versed in the
intricacies of stock transactions in case their illicit clients
actually expressed an interest in buying stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never did,'' Andrejko said. ``And we never strongly
encouraged that.''
</P>
<P>
   What the investigation allowed federal agents to do was identify
drug sales networks in a host of U.S. cities and 340 bank accounts
in South America, the United States, the Caribbean and Switzerland
where drug money was funneled once it was washed through legitimate
businesses or front companies into the international banking
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the money was picked up by our undercover agents, it was
wire-transferred into undercover bank accounts the government
controlled,'' Andrejko said. ``Instructions were given to
undercover agents as to where traffickers wanted that money sent.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents arranged wire transfers of dirty cash gleaned
from multiple U.S. drug sales through a maze of international
accounts, Andrejko said.
</P>
<P>
   Before the investigation ended, the DEA and the IRS had
laundered about $14.5 million in drug money, Andrejko said. But
agents also have seized more than $10 million from drug operations
in New York, Dallas, Houston, Providence, R.I., Miami, Fort
Lauderdale, Chicago, Newark, N.J., San Juan, P.R., Rome, Italy and
Spain uncovered during ``Operation Juno,'' Andrejko said. And
authorities in seven countries were in the process of seizing an
additional $16 million in bank accounts Wednesday, he said. ``I
always referred to the stock brokerage firm as the nerve center,''
Andrejko said. ``That's where all the telecommunications center was
located. That's where the fax machine was. That's where all the
calls came in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to establish an office so if the traffickers wanted
to come and check on where we were located ... we would give have a
legitimate company to give the appearance of a legitimate business
enterprise.''

GORE, IN IOWA, JABS AT BRADLEY OVER FARM PROBLEMS AND PRESCHOOL
FUNDING 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: May be updated with comments from Gore at forum.) 
(nk) 
 By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMES, Iowa _ Vice President Al Gore campaigned through central
Iowa on Wednesday and sparred at long distance with former Sen.
Bill Bradley over farm problems and pre-school education.
</P>
<P>
   Before speaking here at a forum sponsored by the Iowa Farmers
Union, Gore used half a dozen radio and television interviews to
complain that Bradley had declined to debate him over farm issues
here Wednesday or next month in Cedar Rapids. ``Senator Bradley has
refused to have a specific debate on farm policy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's spokesman, Eric Hauser, responded from West Orange,
N.J., that there were other forums where the two would appear
together. ``We'll be talking about agriculture a lot with Al Gore
in Iowa, and we look forward to it,'' Hauser said.
</P>
<P>
   Then Bradley, the former three-term senator from New Jersey,
said through his campaign staff: ``For seven years, the
Clinton/Gore administration has presided over a farm crisis of
historic proportions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've needed strong leadership for fundamental changes in our
farm programs, and the administration has not provided it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the only presidential candidate who has not stopped
stumping for Christmas, began his campaign day Wednesday at 6 a.m.
at a Des Moines school by appearing at a ``town meeting''
sponsored, and briefly broadcast, by ABC's ``Good Morning
America.'' There he sketched a 10-year, $50 billion proposal for a
``universal preschool initiative that will make high quality
preschool available to every 3 year old in America and expand
coverage to 3-year olds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most learning takes place in the first few years of life,'' he
said, ``and if kids get off to a great start before they ever get
to kindergarten, the chances for them to succeed in life, to have
good jobs, to lead fulfilling lives, is greatly enhanced.''
</P>
<P>
   He proposed expanding preschool education through federal
matching grants to states for classes for 4-year-olds. With some
parents sure not to take advantage of the opportunity, he said, the
left-over funds could be used for programs for 3-year-olds. He said
states would decide what would be taught.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley campaign promptly criticized the proposal as
delivering less than it promised. Based on a Gore campaign estimate
that 75 percent of 4-year-olds would be enrolled, it noted that 64
percent now were in preschool. ``Al Gore would spend $50 billion to
enroll an additional 11 percent of the nation's 4-year-olds in
preschool,'' the Bradley campaign said.
</P>
<P>
   The sniping proceeded. Gore spokesman Chris Lehane issued a
statement saying Bradley was launching ``misleading attacks on
Gore's bold plan'' and asserting, ``Since Bradley has failed to
offer a comprehensive education plan and is running from his
18-year-record of supporting private school vouchers and tax
credits, all his campaign can do is divert and attack.''
</P>
<P>
   In a more general campaign appearance at a breakfast meeting
with Jewish supporters in Des Moines, Gore stressed his experience,
saying he knew how to ``keep the economy going,'' and said he had
maintained a 100 percent pro-Israel voting record in the House,
``compiled on the basis of inner instinct,'' despite having almost
no Jewish constituents to lobby him.
</P>
<P>
   He took credit for his 1991 vote to authorize President Bush to
make war on Iraq, a position Bradley opposed. But for that vote, he
said, Saddam Hussein ``would still be in Kuwait.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also said the next president should be ready to deal with
environmental problems, such as the fact that ``40 percent of the
north polar ice cap has melted.'' Lehane said that after Gore
returned to Washington on Wednesday night, the vice president would
not campaign again until next year.

CLOSE TO HOME: KEEPING HOUSE JUST LIKE MOM 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I grew up with a mother who baked bread, ironed everything from
sheets to jeans, vacuumed the carpet in straight lines and cleaned
the entire house the night before our cleaning person came. The
running joke among my friends was, ``At the Hessers' house, you do
cry over spilled milk.''
</P>
<P>
   So it was with both curiosity and skepticism that I picked up
Cheryl Mendelson's wildly comprehensive, 884-page manual, ``Home
Comforts: The Art and Science of Keeping House'' (Scribner, $35).
In it, Ms. Mendelson covers everything from dusting techniques to
bleach expiration dates.
</P>
<P>
   I have inherited my mother's fussiness and skills, and I have
also read Mrs. Beeton and other old household guides. But I had
never come across one that was current enough to apply to, say, the
age of the washing machine. I was eager to compare my mother's
methods to a pro's, but I was equally anxious to justify my own
high standards.
</P>
<P>
   Housekeeping is no longer the respected craft it once was. In my
generation (younger than Lestoil, older than the Internet), people
are expected to be so casual about their homes that schedules
(Monday, washing; Tuesday, ironing) are a thing of the past. Having
a home with a sense of order is a sign that they are uptight and
rigid, and ripe for parody on a sitcom. Among my friends, I have
often kept a secret: I was all for being clean and neat, and I knew
how to use starch.
</P>
<P>
   So I wondered: Could Ms. Mendelson help my friends who don't
have a clue how to make a bed, wash windows or fluff a down
comforter? Or would her book be a disappointment?
</P>
<P>
   Martha Stewart, for one, fails to impress me. It is all too
clear that she has assistance, getting those fresh Araucana hens'
eggs into the house each morning. She is not about good
housekeeping, my mother says. She is about having a good house.
</P>
<P>
   What's appealing about Ms. Mendelson is that she makes no
assumptions about what high-thread-count linens, antiques, silver
and Miele vacuum cleaners people have. She is concerned instead
that they have a well-run household. And she is full of
revelations.
</P>
<P>
   A tablecloth, Ms. Mendelson writes, should extend 8 to 12 inches
past the edge of the table; for a formal dinner, 12 to 18 inches. A
tablecloth, she adds, is allowed to have a single fold running the
length of the table.
</P>
<P>
   This was news. Tablecloths? How passe. My friends don't use
them. I do, and I have on occasion pulled out my iron and tried to
flatten that fold. That won't happen again.
</P>
<P>
   I read on. In the section on washing dishes, Ms. Mendelson
instructs: ``Fill your dish pan or sink no more than two-thirds
full with water as hot as your hands can bear. This will be hotter
than your bath water. It should be a bit uncomfortable to leave
your hands in it for a sustained period.'' That's my method, too.
So far, so good.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mendelson is adamant that people not use the same dish
towels to dry their hands and dry the dishes, and my mother agrees.
But here I am in the clear, too. It's not that I never use a dish
towel to dry my hands; it's that I rarely ever use one to dry a
dish. To me, that is the line between kitchen work being fun and
kitchen work being work.
</P>
<P>
   Page after page, the instructions continued with the same
incredible detail. It was reassuring to come across techniques that
were familiar to me, like folding sheets and mitering a bed corner.
All this was reassuring in the sense that there were standard
methods, that my mother was not just being particular and that I
measured up.
</P>
<P>
   I learned a new way to fill a duvet, and read about damp
dusting, a technique I had never heard of. But when I turned to a
page with a graphic of how to clean up dirt, I had to put the book
down. Who could possibly need instruction in sweeping, I thought.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Ms. Mendelson is addressing an audience like my
friends, people who may not even own a broom. She is as
businesslike, clinical and thorough as she has to be in this day
and age.
</P>
<P>
   So I went back and read the dirt and broom section. Turns out,
it was fascinating. Ms. Mendelson discusses the pros and cons of
brooms, then describes smart sweeping, which for her means
collecting dirt in the center of the room (the shortest distance
from the walls), and keeping the broom close to the floor, so dirt
isn't thrown into the air. Ms. Mendelson, who is a Harvard lawyer
and structures her arguments like one, may convince slovenly
readers to stop reading and sweep the floor or at least make their
beds.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The illustration of how full to fill your dryer at first seemed
fairly ridiculous. But then I recalled seeing friends stuff their
dryers full and wonder why their socks were damp.
</P>
<P>
   The book is filled with such practical information. Over the
next week, I found myself going back to it with my own questions.
How does Ms. Mendelson recommend drying sweaters? There's a special
flat square rack that sits a few inches off the floor. How does she
iron clothing? It takes her 12 pages to say, but those are 12 pages
packed with detailed information and illustrations. I had never
seen a sleeve board before and never thought to keep a damp sponge
handy to dampen a wrinkle before ironing it.
</P>
<P>
   The book stumbled on a few questions. A friend called to ask me
how to get candle wax out of her carpet. I checked and found there
was nothing in the book on candle wax. Nor was there advice on how
to get rid of Indian meal moths, a recent problem for me.
</P>
<P>
   But eventually I realized that I was missing the point. Ms.
Mendelson offers few cures for minor household dilemmas because
there are plenty of books that will tell you how to remove stains
and fill dents. What is most interesting about this book is Ms.
Mendelson's point of view. Though she is happy to describe the
method she uses, she acknowledges that keeping house is a matter of
individuality.
</P>
<P>
   But since almost no one discusses housekeeping anymore, how
would anyone know enough to develop an individual housekeeping
system? Which is why this book feels like such an anomaly. It
represents a kind of writing that practically doesn't exist
anymore. The household guides of the last century were not as
detailed as Ms. Mendelson's guide, but in them readers could learn
how to keep cows, make a compost heap and build an ice house.
</P>
<P>
   For sociological reasons, housekeeping guides fell out of favor
in this century. And they fell out of favor at almost the same time
that the number of cookbooks expanded phenomenally. Innovations
like the dish washer, vacuum cleaner and clothes dryer, Ms.
Mendelson writes, promised to make housekeeping easier. Then, when
women moved into the work force, housekeeping began to seem
old-fashioned. Knowledge was not passed down, leaving many people
not only unwilling to do housework but also ill equipped.
</P>
<P>
   In her introduction, she explains why housekeeping is important,
and why it should be revived. She articulates what I had never
realized when I was fluffing sofa pillows and cleaning windows.
These chores have very little to do with being meticulous and
clean, she says. Instead, they are the means to psychological well
being. It doesn't really matter how someone folds a towel, but it
provides a foundation if a person has a system for folding towels.
</P>
<P>
   Faking it is not an option. ``I know from experience,'' Ms.
Mendelson writes, ``that you cannot make a home by imitating the
household chores and crafts of a past era. Ironically, people are
led into the error of playing house instead of keeping house by a
genuine desire for a home and its comforts.''
</P>
<P>
   My mother's house was immaculate, but it was also warm and
welcoming; friends visited frequently. There was never a sense of
chaos, just comfort.
</P>
<P>
   In my friends' homes, this feeling is practically nonexistent.
Many feel more like hotels than homes. ``As people turn more and
more to outside institutions to have their needs met (for food,
comfort, clean laundry, relaxation, entertainment, society,
rest),'' Ms. Mendelson writes, ``domestic skills and expectations
further diminish, in turn decreasing the chance that people's homes
can satisfy their needs. The result is far too many people who long
for home even though they seem to have one.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans have tried to provide comfort with material goods. An
imposing, soft-cushioned sofa does not necessarily make a warm
living room. But a clean and well-ordered living room _ no matter
what the furnishings _ has soul.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mendelson's book offers an interesting glimpse of how one
woman runs her home. It is admirable and enviable. Now, if I can
just convince my friends.

ROBERT BRESSON: A PURE VISION OF CINEMA 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB GRAHAM  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The films of Robert Bresson were not filmed novels or filmed
stage plays. They were not like paintings or pretexts for special
effects.
</P>
<P>
   They were pure cinema.
</P>
<P>
   Bresson was the rigorous, ascetic master of French cinema. He
died over the weekend in Paris at the age of 98.
</P>
<P>
   In that extraordinarily long life, he always was true to his own
vision, never courted popular approval and ended up with one of the
most influential bodies of work in the history of the art.
</P>
<P>
   Many would say that any list of his masterpieces would have to
be led by ``Pickpocket'' (1959) and include his other masterpieces
of the '50s: ``Journal d'un cure de campagne'' (Diary of a Country
Priest), ``Un condamne a mort s'est echappe'' (A Condemned Man
Escapes).
</P>
<P>
   Coming to filmmaking late _ he made his first when he was 33 _
Bresson worked slowly but methodically. His last film, ``L'Argent''
(Money) was released in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   He had continued to live in a fifth-floor walkup on Quai de
Bourbon on Paris' Isle St. Louis, an island in the Seine.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Scarlet, artistic director of the San Francisco
International Film Festival, recalls visiting him there in 1988 and
taking him out to the Champs Elysees to have his picture taken.
</P>
<P>
   He was spry and looked around the boulevard, and in his high,
reedy voice said, ``So that's how women are dressing these days,''
Scarlet recalls, which led him to believe that it had been a while
since Bresson had been out.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion was never of much interest to Bresson anyway, Scarlet
says, either in the literal or broader senses. When ``L'Argent''
won a prize at the Cannes Film Festival, an international
marketplace, the announcement of the award was hooted. ``The idea
of Bresson at Cannes was sort of like having Mother Teresa at a
fashion show,'' Scarlet says. ``His presence reveals the sham and
emptiness of everything around it.''
</P>
<P>
   He never had a smash box-office success or won an Academy Award,
Scarlet says, ``which I am sure never bothered him a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Bresson's writing about film was as spare and evocative as his
making of them. His ``Notes sur le cinematographe'' (Notes on
Filmmaking, Paris, 1975) amounts to a series of maxims. ``The truth
of filmmaking cannot be the truth of the theater, of the novel nor
the truth of painting,'' he wrote. What film captures must be
intrinsically different from what other arts capture.
</P>
<P>
   ``His films are about what all films should be about,'' Scarlet
says. ``They are a reminder of what we lose track of, that film is
not all those other arts. He was a keeper of the flame and a
reminder to all filmmakers that you're not really making film
unless you use to the maximum the extraordinary language of film.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the curious things about Bresson is that he avoided using
professional actors. Their ``histrionics'' interfered. He used
amateur actors speaking almost in monotone. Emotions, including
very deep ones, were conveyed by the succession of images:
close-ups of details, telling dolly shots and resetting of the
frame to intensify the effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pickpocket'' is a good example. A sequence on the Paris Metro
shows the pickpocket at work. It is all built on close-ups,
glances, hands, bodies, eyes. There is no dialogue, but
nonetheless, Scarlet says, it is tense and upsetting.
</P>
<P>
   Bresson's films could be very moving as well. In ``Au Hasard,
Balthazar'' (By Chance, Balthazar, 1966), the lives and vices of a
number of persons are seen through the eyes of a dumb beast, a
donkey that passes through their hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``His works are not difficult, yet `Balthazar' is utterly
mysterious,'' Scarlet says. ``It is hard to figure out how it can
continue to move you even if you have seen it 10 times.''
</P>
<P>
   Scarlet is fortunate. The nature of his work allows him to see
great films 10 times. Otherwise, he says, the availability of good
subtitled prints of Bresson's work in this country is ``shameful.''
</P>
<P>
   The film festival honored Bresson with a retrospective of eight
films when he won the Akira Kurosawa Award for lifetime achievement
in 1988, but access still remains shamefully limited today, he
says. The Pacific Film Archive in Berkeley presented another
retrospective last year, but it was a touring show organized in
Toronto. ``The condition of American prints is unacceptable,''
Scarlet says.
</P>
<P>
   If people want to regard Bresson's work as almost religious or
metaphysical, the films will bear such a view. ``His movies have a
particular force,'' Scarlet says. ``They show us that the reality
of this world demands our attentiveness. By looking very closely at
what this world is, he thought it would reveal another world.''

 (af)  
 By PETER APPLEBOME   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is entirely possible that someone other than Errol Morris
could have decided to make a nonfiction film about an oddly likable
developer of ``humane'' execution devices who, based on his own
utterly dubious science, goes on to gain international fame as a
Holocaust denier.
</P>
<P>
   And it's conceivable that someone with a particularly macabre
sense of the absurd could have even dreamed up Fred A. Leuchter
Jr., an earnest dweeb with a thick Massachusetts accent and a
fondness for death chamber technology, who drinks 40 cups of coffee
and smokes six packs of cigarettes a day, meets his wife-to-be at
the local Dunkin' Donuts and then jets off with her to Auschwitz,
and is partial to comments like, ``Every time there's a gas
execution, it's an accident waiting to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Still ``Mr. Death: The Rise and Fall of Fred A. Leuchter Jr.,''
Morris' new film, which opens Wednesday (an alternative title,
briefly considered, was ``Honeymoon at Auschwitz''), seems so much
the quintessential Morris project _ with its mix of death and
humor, the goony and the profound _ that even Morris gets a little
nervous talking about it, and not just because of the political
sensitivity of the subject matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have this tendency to overintellectualize what I do,''
Morris said, at the downtown Manhattan studio where he makes
commercials when he's not turning out his own blend of (``don't
call them documentaries'') nonfiction films like ``The Thin Blue
Line,'' the investigation of the murder of a Dallas policeman; ``A
Brief History of Time,'' about the cosmologist Stephen Hawking, and
``Fast, Cheap and Out of Control,'' a profile of four amiable
obsessives.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I like least of all explicating this one,'' he said.
``Don't get me wrong. I can and will babble on about it. But I
prefer to have people look at it and see what they make of it, in
the way I did it thinking: `What am I doing? What am I
(italics)really(end italics) doing? It's no accident, after all,
that two people obsessed with death, namely me and Fred Leuchter,
end up in Auschwitz, the epicenter of 20th- century death.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris is 51, with graying hair and a chunkier frame than when
he first became well known with ``The Thin Blue Line.'' He grew up
in New York City, where his father, a doctor, died when he was 2
years old, and his mother, a Juilliard-trained music teacher,
raised him to be a concert cellist. He went to science-fiction
films like ``This Island Earth'' and ``Creature From the Black
Lagoon'' with his Aunt Rosalind, studied history at the University
of Wisconsin and enrolled in a doctoral program in philosophy at
the University of California at Berkeley, where he worked toward a
PhD that he never quite finished.
</P>
<P>
   But he soon gravitated toward film and, in particular,
interviews with the eccentric, the marginal and the sometimes
dangerous. Before long, he had more or less invented a hybrid form
that treats nonfiction events and real people in a way that mixes
sober interviews with sometimes surreal re-enactments. It is to the
conventional documentaries of, say, the Burns brothers as Chagall
is to Grant Wood.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of Morris' intensely odd, cerebral films will find
themselves on stylistically familiar terrain in ``Mr. Death.''
Morris' films, at their heart, are about, to use a ridiculously
overblown word from his philosophy days, epistemology _ the nature
of knowledge: what things are and what they seem to be, how people
know what they think they know, and do they really know it or just
think they know it?
</P>
<P>
   His main device is simply to sit his subjects in front of a
device he invented called the Interretron, a two-way mirror that
allows a subject to speak into the camera while seeing Morris'
face. It's not entirely clear whether people respond to the process
or to Morris' disarming absent-minded-professor persona.
</P>
<P>
   But whether it's the people in ``Gates of Heaven'' babbling on
about the pet cemetery business or the bizarre cast of ``The Thin
Blue Line,'' in which the only honest man is a a drifter wrongly
convicted of a murder he did not commit, his subjects tend to
natter on endlessly as if injected with some sort of truth serum.
</P>
<P>
   At his best, the end result is work that's one part Freud, one
part William James and one part the Marx Brothers. Or, as someone
once suggested, a cross between ``60 Minutes'' and ``The Twilight
Zone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always believed that people construct for themselves some
kind of world they live in that they reveal through language,''
Morris said. ``So putting people in front of a camera and letting
them talk is a way of creating a kind of interior monologue, a
monologue about self, and people always say really surprising
things.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Thin Blue Line,'' one witness, Emily Miller, says:
`Everywhere I go, there's murders, even around my house.' It tells
us a lot about Emily Miller. Not that everywhere she goes there are
murders, but that she sees herself as a protagonist in a crime
drama. She is living in some whacked-out Boston Blackie movie.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Thin Blue Line,'' Morris' 1988 account of the Texas
murder case, the interviews and his own sleuthing solved a murder
that sent the wrong man, Randall Dale Adams, to Death Row and set
the real killer, David Harris, free to kill again.
</P>
<P>
   This time his subject is much more weighty. He's trying to solve
the mystery of the Holocaust: not did it happen, but how could it
happen? And the answer, subject to a million different
interpretations, lies in the passionately matter-of-fact stream of
verbiage pouring out of Leuchter's mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Leuchter, whose story unfolds like a mixture of something out of
Vladimir Nabokov and Kurt Vonnegut, grew up the son of a
Massachusetts correction officer. As an adult, he developed the
ultimate niche business in Malden, Mass., designing and repairing
execution chambers for the states that have capital punishment. His
goal, he says, is to make them more humane rather than faulty
electric chairs, which he says, torture their victims while
``cooking the meat.''
</P>
<P>
   He proposes, for example, a lethal-injection chamber more like a
dentist's office with a contoured chair, television and perhaps
pictures on the wall (the film posits a peaceful scene out of
Currier &AMP; Ives) rather than a gurney and bare walls. It's a career,
he explains in a spectacularly unconvincing observation, much like
any other.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no difference between a life-support system and an
execution system,'' he allows, adding the subtle proviso, ``except
that if a life-support system fails you die, and if an execution
system fails you live.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first third of the film we're in the eerie but vaguely
terrestrial realm of Leuchter's death-implement business. But in
the 1980s, Leutcher found himself a central figure in a far darker
drama. He was hired by a neo-Nazi named Ernest Zunder, author of
tracts with titles like ``The Hitler We Loved and Why,'' to
disprove the existence of the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1988, Leuchter took off for Poland, where in a
stunning act of desecration, he used a hammer and chisel to knock
off pieces of the walls of crematoria, which were later subjected
to chemical analysis that found no traces of cyanide. From this, he
deduced, in a report hailed by Holocaust deniers around the world,
that the Holocaust never happened.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The report, distributed over the Internet and disseminated by
neo-Nazi groups, made him famous in a shadow world but ruined him
in his own. Hounded by critics, he lost his business, and his
marriage eventually fell apart.
</P>
<P>
   As the film explains, the science of the study was thoroughly
flawed, and even the chemist who did the analysis of the fragments
told Morris that the findings were meaningless. It turned out that
most of the surfaces Leutcher had used had been dismantled,
dynamited and subjected to the elements in a way that made them
useless for analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, cyanide gas, if any existed, would have penetrated less
than a hairbreadth beneath the surface of the walls. So when
Leuchter took samples by gouging out chunks of the walls, he
diluted his sample by upward of 10,000 times, Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   Morris demolishes the spurious science of the report almost as
an aside. And in the end what really intrigues him is not
Leuchter's report but Leuchter's mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that I wear a hat, but if I did, as a practitioner of this
particular form, I would take my hat off to Fred for being such a
worthy subject,'' Morris said. ``So when Fred talks about painless
executions, you have to wonder, what's going on here? What can he
mean? And when he goes to Auschwitz, the job he's least qualified
of all to do, and comes back thinking that somehow he had
irrefutable knowledge, that he has the truth, you have a study in
hubris and vanity that you could not make up.
</P>
<P>
   ``My question for Fred was, `Do you ever think you might be
wrong?' and his answer was very interesting. He doesn't say, `No.'
He says, `I'm long past that.'''
</P>
<P>
   Morris, of course, would be a perfect subject for his own
movies, not just because he's such a good talker but because he's
such an expressive one. He speaks in eloquent bursts, usually
punctuated at the end by a quick, bemused snort. The snort is
followed by a pause, and then another verbal excursion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get myself in trouble when I say I like Fred, because that
needs to be followed by various qualifiers that I can find him
sympathetic and likable but find his work not at all sympathetic or
likable, but I almost see him as a lovable idiot. He's like a
character out of Nabokov, who pioneered the technique of the
clueless narrator. But the real question about the film is
something that goes back to Plato. Do people have evil in their
hearts, or do they do sometimes commit truly despicable acts while
convincing themselves they're good? It's the reason the Eichmann
trial, to mention the obvious example, became such a watershed.
</P>
<P>
   ``So Fred seems himself in various ways. He sees himself as a
humanitarian, the Florence Nightingale of Death Row, the man who
took the ouch out of the death penalty. He's a concerned citizen,
seeker of truth, civil libertarian. Who would speak for people like
Zundel if not him? Finally, he sees himself as ultimately a
Christlike figure, hounded and persecuted and reviled, as he sees
it, because of his inherent goodness and correctness.''
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, is very sensitive terrain, so sensitive the
film almost did not get made. Morris conducted his interviews with
Leuchter in 1992, and they sat around for five and a half years
because no one wanted to finance the project. Morris recognizes
that his film gives voice to ideas usually not given a public
forum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this movie suggests in any way that Fred's ideas
are sympathetic, because obviously I don't,'' said Morris, who is
Jewish and who lost relatives in the Holocaust. ``But I do think
Holocaust denial is something worthy of examination. The Holocaust
itself is worthy of examination. It's the epicenter of evil in our
century. It was unfathomably evil, but looking at it is a good
thing rather than a bad thing. And Holocaust denial, in my view, is
an alternative route into the Holocaust.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris has many other alternative routes in mind for the future,
many of them projects that have been percolating for years, like
``Weirdo,'' about the breeding of a giant chicken, or ``Insanity
Inside Out,'' the story of a man who was wrongly committed by his
parents to a mental institution until freed by the Supreme Court.
(``The tagline,'' he said, ``is: `You seek vindication from the
highest tribunal in the land, namely your parents. When that fails,
you go to the Supreme Court.''')
</P>
<P>
   Morris is also preparing a television series of interviews with
the famous and the nonfamous, in between doing commercials, like an
elliptical series on real men for Miller Beer that is almost as
offbeat as his films. And he's hoping to find a way to do a fiction
film that works the way his non-fiction ones do.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever worries Morris may have, running out of material is not
one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``After doing this since the early '70s, I think I've got good
and bad news,'' he said. ``The bad news is that rationality is the
exception, not the rule. The good news is, that works well for my
art.''

HAUL OF FAME: VH1 SHOW APPRAISES ROCK MEMORABILIA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The question is so obvious.
</P>
<P>
   Does Bill Brand, executive producer of the new ``VH1 Rock
Collectors,'' have his own secret cache of rock artifacts?
</P>
<P>
   A guitar signed by Carlos Santana, perhaps?
</P>
<P>
   A U2 ticket autographed by Bono?
</P>
<P>
   A rare Beatles lunchbox?
</P>
<P>
   No, no and ... no. But if the show (which airs 11 a.m.
Saturdays) says anything, it says that Joe and Jane Doe out there
may well have some piece of history that's worth anywhere from a
couple of hundred to several thousand dollars.
</P>
<P>
   And that, Brand is betting, is the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to tap into people's memories and their
stories,'' says Brand, who with only a little prompting 'fesses up
to owning a picture of Paul McCartney taken by Linda McCartney, and
a fistful of laminated backstage passes. ``One woman I met lived in
a little town in Ohio in the '50s, and people there burned rock 'n'
roll albums. She hid her Elvis album under a bed. That album now is
worth about $200, but her memory is priceless. And it's part of our
history.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Collectors,'' which premiered Nov. 27, is keyed to such
memories: While the show has several facets, its main feature is
having people come forward and have items appraised by, among
others, experts from Sotheby's auction house and the Rock and Roll
Hall of Fame and Museum.
</P>
<P>
   So far, those items have included a scrap/autograph book
including personal notes from the Beatles (Ringo Starr and Pete
Best!), found to be worth $10,000; Bob Dylan's typewritten lyrics
from the ``Blonde on Blonde'' sessions, left behind at a Nashville
studio, appraised at $50,000; and a 78 by shadowy blues legend
Charlie Patton, bought at a yard sale for $3 and now worth $8,000.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the show, Brand says, came up at a brainstorming
meeting this year. As a test, a call was put out in Cleveland that
appraisers would be at the rock museum for one day in June.
</P>
<P>
   More than 150 people showed up. Brand's response: ``We've got a
show here, folks.''
</P>
<P>
   And they did. Subsequent stops have been made in Miami, Austin
and Las Vegas. Footage from all three stops was incorporated into
the show's debut: One man in Miami had a contract signed by Jimi
Hendrix and plucked from a London trash bin (estimated value:
$5,000-$10,000); a woman in Vegas had several promotional fliers of
several shows in San Francisco during the height of the
flower-power years _ estimated value, $400-$700.
</P>
<P>
   Rock auctions will also figure into the ``Collectors'' format:
The first show had Mariah Carey talking about her love of Marilyn
Monroe; she subsequently bought Monroe's personal piano at a
Christie's auction for $600,000.
</P>
<P>
   Also shown was a Christie's auction, at which dozens of Eric
Clapton's guitars were on the block to raise funds for a
drug-treatment center he had built in Antigua. One of them was the
famous ``Brownie,'' long his favorite guitar _ and the one he used
for the ``Layla &AMP; Other Assorted Love Songs'' sessions _ which
fetched $450,000.
</P>
<P>
   The show also featured Boy George browsing in a New York store
specializing in star memorabilia _ and finding a doll of himself
from the days when Culture Club was one of the biggest bands in the
world. ``It doesn't look anything like me a'tall,'' he said with a
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   But the show needed to be more interactive, so two features were
added. One showcases the home movies of memorabilia collectors. The
other is the launch of the VH1.com auction site; Mariah Carey,
Billy Joel, the Backstreet Boys, Fender Guitars and the Hard Rock
Cafe have all contributed items, the sale proceeds of which will go
to the VH1 Save the Music program, which works to restore music
programs in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, items appraised on the show will be put up for
auction, and the site will also be home to American Music
Memorabilia Professionals, which provides its own items for sale
and verifies the authenticity of other items on the site. The
auction site will be updated every week, Brand says, whether the
show that week is new or a rerun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're creating a market for people who want to buy and
sell things,'' says Brand. ``It sparks interest in people to say,
`What do I have stored away that might be worth something?' Most of
us won't get rich from this. People are looking at it for the
memories and the stories.''

GAY (Washington) - Last week, Arizona Sen. John McCain collected
$40,000 from a fund-raiser sponsored by the Log Cabin Republicans,
a gay GOP group. But, in the same week, the ``Washington Blade''
called McCain an ``enigma,'' on gay issues, noting he was once
keynote speaker to an Oregon group that was condemning
homosexuality as ``perverse.'' How can we explain the apparent
contradiction? And is McCain willing to step in on behalf of
reservist Steve May, who is about to get the boot? by JEFF BARKER.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Charles Zhang is a young man in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang, the 35-year-old founder of one of China's hottest
Internet companies, Sohu.com, swept into his office here the other
day amid a flurry of ringing mobile phones and scampering aides. He
was late for another meeting, he explained quickly to a visitor.
Could the interview be put off for an hour? Better yet, could he
chat by cell phone on the way to the appointment?
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Zhang found time to sit down in a conference room,
as his co-workers paced outside the glass door. ``When I started
this company two years ago,'' he said, ``we were working in
complete obscurity. Now it is so much like Silicon Valley. It
happened so suddenly.''
</P>
<P>
   China's Internet industry has tantalized outsiders ever since
the country's Communist leaders made it clear that they welcomed
the digital revolution. But in the last six months, the novelty has
mutated into a kind of obsession. With the number of online users
tripling in 1999, to nearly 7 million, the Internet in China looks
like a here-and-now opportunity. Foreign technology companies,
venture capitalists and investment banks are all angling for pieces
of it.
</P>
<P>
   Although Zhang happens to work in the capital of nominally
communist China, not far from Tiananmen Square, he might as well be
in San Francisco, Seattle or any other place where starting a
dot-com company seems like a ticket to instant riches. His life has
become a whirl of salesmanship as he seals joint ventures, drums up
money from investors and prepares his company to go public.
</P>
<P>
   It is not that Chinese online companies make any money; as in
Silicon Valley, they wear their losses like a badge of honor. Nor
is China anywhere close to being a mass market. Its entire online
advertising business generated about $12 million in revenue this
year. A recent Gallup survey found that just 14 percent of China's
1.2 billion people had even heard of the Internet _ let alone used
it.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, foreign investors are betting that China will soon have
one of the world's biggest Internet markets, perhaps second only to
the United States. As they have in other Chinese industries,
foreigners with stars in their eyes are rushing to finance a
handful of home-grown companies that they believe will be this
country's eBays and Yahoos.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at potential Internet usage in China, the numbers
are absolutely staggering,'' said Gordon Chang, a partner who
advises Internet companies in the Shanghai office of the law firm
Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &AMP; Garrison. ``Of course, it leads
people to do silly things.''
</P>
<P>
   China.com, a Hong Kong company that operates a little-visited
Web site on the mainland, set off the current stampede in July when
it raised $84 million in a stock offering on NASDAQ that valued the
start-up at $1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Sina.com, a Beijing-based company that operates the most popular
Chinese site, raised $65 million in September and hopes to sell
shares on NASDAQ in January.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang's Sohu.com, best known for its search engine and
electronic directory, has raised more than $10 million from
investors like Intel, Dow Jones and Hang Lung, a Hong Kong property
developer. It, too, hopes to issue shares on NASDAQ in the first
half of 2000. Farther down the road is Netease, a Beijing company
that runs Web sites and online auctions of goods ranging from
computers to cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, China's entire Internet industry has become an auction
of sorts. Executives like Zhang, Daniel Mao, the chief operating
officer of Sina.com, and William Ding, the founder of Netease, have
all listened to bankers from the Goldman Sachs Group, Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter and other firms tell them what lavish multiples
their companies will trade at after they issue stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``VC'' _ which once suggested Viet Cong in East Asia _ now
stands for venture capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are talking about VCs, strategic-round financing, stock
options, market cap, management teams,'' said Zhang, a Beijing
native who spent nine years in the United States and has a Ph.D. in
physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ``It's all
this American management jargon.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Relentless news coverage, which lionizes young technology
executives as fearless pioneers, has added to the expectations.
People like Zhang and Edward Zeng, the founder of Sparkice.com, are
celebrities in China. And they behave that way, according to their
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some overseas Chinese came back here with swelled heads,''
said Wang Yan, 27, general manager of Sina.com. Wang, who studied
law in France and returned in 1996, is not lacking in confidence
himself.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of a rich payday is so palpable in the offices of
China's young Internet companies that some experts worry that money
may corrupt the industry. While these analysts acknowledge that
high salaries and rich stock options will attract bright young
people, they say that the founders of the companies are spending
too much time hustling for cash, and too little creating real
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot look at Silicon Valley and not be influenced by
it,'' said Duncan Clark, a partner at BDA China, an Internet
consulting firm in Beijing. ``The question is whether all this
money is going to spoil the industry.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The culture of Wall Street has already caused management strains
at Sohu. Several senior employees left last year after complaining
that Zhang had refused to share ownership. Zhang said it was too
early to grant stock options in 1998 because Chinese employees did
not grasp the concept. He said he began handing out options this
summer, and they are now very popular.
</P>
<P>
   A visit to Sohu's offices shows that the gap between northern
California and northern China is not easily bridged. With its
young, sweatsuit-clad programmers hunched over PCs and Apple
Macintoshes, the company looks like any other start-up. But sitting
in the middle of the office is a time clock that employees must
punch daily.
</P>
<P>
   With more than a hint of jest, Sohu chief financial officer
Victor Koo said, ``We view ourselves as a Silicon Valley company
with Chinese characteristics.''
</P>
<P>
   Many companies have dealt with the growing financial demands by
recruiting American-trained Chinese, like Koo, to handle
fund-raising and investor relations. Koo, 33, has degrees from the
University of California at Berkeley and Stanford University, where
he was a classmate of Mao of Sina.com.
</P>
<P>
   Netease is typical in its evolution. Started in 1997 by Ding, a
soft-spoken engineer from Ningbo, near Shanghai, it sold e-mail
servers to Internet access providers. Later, the company developed
its own Web sites, specializing in e-mail and chat rooms. When it
began drawing interest from foreign investors, Ding thought that
his English was not good enough to handle presentations. So he
recruited two American-trained Chinese executives, Helen He and
Oliver Kwan.
</P>
<P>
   Kwan, who worked for an asset management firm in New York, said
he was attracted to a career in finance by the movie character
Gordon Gekko, the flamboyant, if ethics-free trader in Oliver
Stone's film ``Wall Street.'' But he said he was also impressed by
Americans' unlimited access to computers. When Ding approached him
about returning to China to join Netease, he traded in his
pinstriped suits for rumpled chinos.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Now, Netease is making the transformation from a software
provider to a large-market Internet company. The company has
completed two rounds of financing, raising nearly $20 million. And
it is mentioned, along with Sina.com and Sohu.com, among the most
promising candidates for an initial public offering. But Kwan said
he was putting the brakes on expectations of a quick sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a CEO; we need a good management team,'' he said. ``If
you do an IPO before you're ready and you miss your revenue
projections for one quarter, the market will cut your stock price
in half in a day.''
</P>
<P>
   While the influx of foreign-trained Chinese has given these
companies a veneer of financial sophistication, some people contend
that it has shifted the focus away from creating services that
appeal to customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People never ask you about your new products,'' Ding said.
``They only ask you, `When is your IPO?'''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Sina.com seems likely to be the first mainland
Chinese company to issue shares _ as early as January. The company,
formed by the merger of an American Internet company that catered
to overseas Chinese and a Beijing concern, operates a popular Web
site here, with an estimated 5 million page views a day. Sina.com
has more than a million registered users.
</P>
<P>
   Sina.com had hoped to offer its stock this fall, but delayed it
because of sudden uncertainty in the Chinese Internet market. In
September, China's top communications official unexpectedly
reaffirmed the long ban on foreign investment in
telecommunications. The announcement unnerved the foreign partners
in all these companies, and temporarily chilled the market.
</P>
<P>
   The trade agreement between the United States and China in
November eased those fears. Assuming it is approved by Congress, it
will by 2002 open the door to foreign ownership of up to 50 percent
of Internet content companies, and by 2006. up to 49 percent of
Internet service providers. But the Chinese official, Wu Jichuan,
has made it clear that Beijing can tie up foreign investors in
cumbersome licensing procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, there is the question of how much freedom the Beijing
government really plans to give the Internet. Sina.com and Sohu.com
both offer news on their sites and have partnerships with Western
media companies like Dow Jones and Reuters. But both these Chinese
companies, in response to government pressure, have dropped
nonfinancial foreign news. Beijing has also warned them not to
provide links to the Web sites of foreign news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   For Zhang, staying out of trouble is a simple matter of knowing
the boundaries. ``It works if you are cooperative and don't
underestimate the government's intelligence,'' he said. ``If you
become too confrontational, the government feels like it's being
insulted and it will shut you down.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhang insisted that officials in Beijing could not halt the
growth of the Internet in China, even if they wanted to. And he
said he did not feel hemmed in by political constraints.
``Besides,'' he said with a wave of his hand, ``the Internet is not
just about political issues; 99 percent of it is about people's
lives.''

 By BRUCE WEBER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a speedy tour of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, where he
has been director for five years, Malcolm Rogers stopped in the
high-ceilinged corridor that was once a tapestry gallery and is now
the entryway to the museum's collection of European paintings.
Fifty-four paintings from the 16th and 17th centuries, including
works by Titian, El Greco, Velazquez and Rubens, are mounted two
and three high. It is a commanding medley, a brazen array of
artistic riches that tends to make visitors halt in their tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful room for displaying art,'' Rogers said,
``that people used to walk right through without stopping.''
</P>
<P>
   The comment, deft and quite possibly calculated to head off the
criticism that the exhibition enhances the dazzle of the room at
the expense of the individual paintings, is emblematic of Rogers'
stewardship and the rancorous debate it has generated over his new
model for museum management.
</P>
<P>
   In the broadest terms, what he has done at one of the nation's
most established (and by most accounts stodgy) museums is to put a
priority on enhancing the experience of visitors with the idea of
attracting a larger, younger and more diverse audience. That has
worked.
</P>
<P>
   But it is an effort, his critics say, that undermines the
seriousness of a serious place. The angry controversy that began in
June over Rogers' announcement of a restructuring of the museum's
organization and staff keeps being revived by aftershocks.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Ellenor Alcorn, a curator of decorative arts who had
been at the museum 17 years, resigned. She was the third curator to
depart this fall, after two others, both in the decorative arts,
were dismissed in the reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want the institution to be damaged more than it has,''
Ms. Alcorn said. ``But the decorative arts collections cannot
survive without the restitution of the positions that were
eliminated.''
</P>
<P>
   The treatment of decorative arts, Rogers' detractors say, is
typical of his priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the new director is good at getting money, and I
applaud that,'' said Fred Licht, a curator and scholar who has
resigned from the museum's visiting committee in protest. ``But his
acquisitions, his exhibition policies, everything that has to do
with art is a disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Licht is unusual among art professionals for attaching his name
to a pejorative opinion, but he is not alone in that opinion. And
it is indisputable by now that the museum's reputation has suffered
by its lingering status as a culture-war battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   The outrage has shaken and to a degree divided the museum's
board, whose members seem, more than anything, chagrined by the
controversy. And because Rogers, who was previously the deputy
director of the National Portrait Gallery in London and whose
contract here was renewed in October, was hired by the board with a
mandate to make sweeping changes, he has become a flash point in
the debate over how museums ought to be run in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Resiliency and the ability to adapt are quite important in
this job,'' Rogers said.
</P>
<P>
   No one disputes that his tenure, in boom economic times to be
sure, has rescued the museum from severe financial doldrums. His
program of crowd-pleasing exhibitions, from ``Monet in the 20th
Century'' to ``John Singer Sargent'' and a show on the work of the
fashion and celebrity photographer Herb Ritts, and his gift for
fund-raising have turned a $4 million operating deficit in 1995
into an operating surplus last year of $437,000. His efforts have
helped the museum complete a $137 million capital campaign. And the
1.7 million visitors last year were the most in the 129-year
history of the place, with membership, at 103,000, nearly double
what it was five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The museum is now praised, among other things, for its renewed
commitment to building maintenance (several employees mentioned how
much cleaner the place was these days) and for its extended hours.
(It is open seven days a week.) The stately front entrance on
Huntington Avenue, which was closed in 1990 for financial reasons
in a move considered an insult to the working-class neighborhood it
faces, has reopened. And the museum's growing efforts to reach out
to the community (150,000 students, including every fifth grader in
the Boston public schools, took part in museum programs last year)
have helped dispel its reputation as a Brahmin-controlled bastion
of elitism.
</P>
<P>
   But if Rogers, 51, an outgoing, round-faced man with a pleasant
if beleaguered manner, is wont to anticipate opposition, it is not
surprising. He has been drawing increasing criticism from curators,
scholars and newspaper reviewers who lament, often with virulent
disgust, what they see as an autocratically administered art museum
with a diminished emphasis on, well, art.
</P>
<P>
   The imbroglio dates from Rogers' announcement in June that he
would restructure the museum's curatorial model, creating five
megadepartments to increase cooperation among curatorial
specialties in a way better suited to the physical plant of the
museum, which is on the verge of an expansion.
</P>
<P>
   His critics were particularly incensed by the minimal amount of
consultation with curators about the new structure and by the
abrupt dismissal of 18 employees in eliminated departments. Twenty
other people were hired, but among the lost were two senior
decorative-arts curators, Jonathan Fairbanks and Anne Poulet, who
were dismissed early on June 25 and asked to turn in their keys by
the end of the day.
</P>

   In September, Jeffrey Munger, a European decorative arts
curator, resigned. Then in November Theodore E. Stebbins Jr., the
museum's curator of American paintings for 22 years, followed suit,
stinging Rogers and the board with a letter critical of the
reorganization as having created an unfelicitous atmosphere for
curatorial work.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking ahead, I see an endless number of meetings and
memos,'' wrote Stebbins, whom Rogers had promoted to head one of
the museum's new divisions, ``without any assurance, in the end,
that I will have the kind of strong voice curators have
traditionally had in developing exhibitions and publications,
guiding acquisitions, selecting staff and shaping policies.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Stebbins letter renewed the vigor of Rogers' critics. The
new bureaucracy robs curators of their independence, they say, and
they offer a list of slights to the curatorial staff (the canceling
of the museum's scholarly bulletin, for example) and a handful of
pop-culture-oriented exhibitions (like the Ritts show and a
400-year retrospective on guitar design, scheduled next fall) as
evidence that scholarship and high art are not prized as they were.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way the paintings are exhibited!'' Licht exclaimed. ``All
the important jewels of the collection have been massed together in
the tapestry gallery, so that these important things that are the
center of the collection become a corridor. You can't possibly
concentrate on them when you get them massed in close quarters, and
it teaches the public a disrespect for art.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of the dispute is how
vehement it has become. If Rogers' fiercest detractors see the
battle as one between the forces of art and the forces of commerce,
Rogers' staunchest supporters view the conflict as one between the
forces of progress and the forces of inertia. These supporters say
privately that the curators have long been coddled, many have been
unproductive, and the management model that allowed them their
independent pursuit of idiosyncratic interests helped bring the
museum nearly to financial ruin.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I think is going on is that people are scared,'' said
Alan Strassman, a trustee and former board president who was among
the leading developers of the reorganization plan. ``We're going to
redefine the model of how to manage an encyclopedic art museum in
the 21st century. And if people have been very cozy and happy,
they're not going to be very interested in responsibilities
associated with a new template.''
</P>
<P>
   The actual state of affairs, as visits on three consecutive days
and dozens of interviews showed, is more nuanced than either view.
The museum is thronged with visitors, and three current exhibitions
_ one focusing on Egyptian art during the brief reign of the
pharaoh Ikhnaton, another on the work of the 19th-century American
painter Martin Johnson Heade and a third on new paintings by the
contemporary Expressionist Susan Rothenberg, all well reviewed _
certainly argue against the notion that it has forsworn curatorial
standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Egypt exhibit exemplifies the highest scholarship,''
Rogers said, with more than a hint of exasperation. ``And the very
critics who have accused me of dumbing down the museum love it. And
it was my idea. It's so peculiar.''
</P>
<P>
   Some administrators at other museums recognize the pickle he's
in. ``This is what directors are hired to do, and it's what they
inevitably have to do, make big decisions that are controversial,''
said the director of a major museum in New York, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. ``Whether this particular plan is a good
idea is debatable but not inconceivable. That is, it was perfectly
reasonable to suggest this plan. You can debate whether it is an
intelligent one.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That is precisely what happened, at high volume. The plan was
immediately denounced by art scholars, who among other things found
it untenable to think that a single curator could satisfyingly
oversee such disparate collections as, for example, American
paintings, decorative arts and pre-Columbian art, which have been
gathered under the rubric Art of the Americas, headed until
recently by Stebbins.
</P>
<P>
   The dismissals that ignited much of the criticism were handled
poorly, most board members admit. They say they followed the advice
of outside consultants to get them over with as quickly as
possible. And they have softened their announced position on the
restructuring, saying there is some room for flexibility. (
Fairbanks and Ms. Poulet, the dismissed curators, who have been
given emeritus positions, said they were constrained from
commenting by their severance agreements.)
</P>
<P>
   In the museum Rogers' supporters have seen positive changes.
What the director has done, said Nancy Allen, a 24-year employee
who is director of information resources, is change the culture of
the institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's different now is that change is possible,'' said Ms.
Allen, who is in charge of developing the museum's computerized
database and of augmenting the photographic documentation of the
museum's holdings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten funding to photograph every Rembrandt, Duerer and
Goya in our collection. We plan to photograph every item in the
textile collection. These things were never within our reach. If it
takes a Herb Ritts show to do that, all I can say is, `What's the
next Herb Ritts show?' I don't know what it feels like to be a
curator now, but I can't believe there's not enough respect to go
around.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Ms Alcorn's resignation showed, wounds remain open. Over
the summer, as published criticism continued and museum
professionals from around the country wrote in to express concern,
divisions within the board surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   In August, James Cuno, a trustee who is director of the Fogg Art
Museum at Harvard University, wrote a four-page letter to the board
president, Robert P. Henderson, which was distributed among the
trustees. In it he detailed the unanswered questions about the
restructuring plan and said the board should seriously consider the
criticism that the museum's curatorial enterprise was being
undervalued.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides say it will take years for their points to be proved.
Either the new structure will work and a financially sound
institution will provide increased community service for a growing
audience as it maintains a foundation of high connoisseurship and
academic rigor, or the devaluing of scholarship will attenuate the
museum's curatorial expertise and the place will devolve into
mediocrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that the kinds of questions that have
come to us from within the scholarly community need to be
addressed,'' said Ted Landsmark, president of the Boston
Architecture Center, who has been on the museum board for five
years. Landsmark was the only one, among a dozen or so interviewed,
to express a conciliatory stance for attribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will need to take deliberate steps designed to reassure the
scholarly and curatorial communities that we have a commitment to
the core value of helping a broad public understand art in
culture,'' he said, ``and that we are not becoming a
financial-based bottom-line institution.''

<P>
   MOSCOW _ After interviewing refugees from the fighting in
Chechnya, an international human rights group said Wednesday that
Russian troops had pillaged a small village there this month and
killed 17 civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The group, Human Rights Watch, said it had conducted interviews
with 15 survivors and that the killings took place in the village
of Alkhan-Yurt, a settlement 10 miles southwest of the Chechen
capital, Grozny, which has been the scene of fierce fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The allegation has emerged as an important test of the Russian
military's credibility, its ability to maintain discipline in its
ranks and its concern for Chechnya's civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Russian military spokesmen have denied that the episode could
have taken place, even as an investigation by Russian authorities
appears to be under way.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of Human Rights Watch have been interviewing
Chechen civilians as they have fled to neighboring Ingushetia,
chronicling abuses by both Russian troops and Chechen rebels.
Residents from Alkhan-Yurt have told them that Russian soldiers
engaged in widespread looting, shooting anyone who tried to stop
them.
</P>
<P>
   Khamid Khazuyev, a local policeman, was one of the victims,
according to Rachel Denber, a deputy director of Human Rights Watch
who helped document the episode. Many of the town's residents had
given Khazuyev their possessions to look after. Russian soldiers on
an armored personnel carrier shot him dead on Dec. 4, raided his
house and burned the home, according to accounts provided to Human
Rights Watch by Khazuyev's wife and neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have interviewed 15 people from this town whose testimony
was credible and mutually confirming,'' Ms. Denber said. ``It has
given us a pretty clear picture of the atrocity that happened at
Alkhan-Yurt.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time that Chechnya's civilians have
complained of abuses on the part of the Russian military. During
the 1994-1996 war, Russian troops went on a rampage in the village
of Samashki, throwing grenades into cellars occupied by civilians.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Moscow asserts, it is determined to win over the
Chechen population by restoring basic services and opening schools
and to deprive the Islamic fighters of the popular support that
would make it easier for them to wage a prolonged guerrilla war.
</P>
<P>
   When there have been abuses, the Russians have sometimes made a
show of punishing the culprits. Russian authorities arrested a
group of soldiers who drove their armored personnel carrier into
the market at Sleptsovskaya in Ingushetia and killed a young woman
who refused to sell them vodka.
</P>
<P>
   The case of Alkhan-Yurt, however, has produced a somewhat
muddled response from Russian authorities. A Russian spokesman
threatened to sue Human Rights Watch for defaming the Russian
military, though the organization says it has been told a military
inquiry is under way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The actions of the Russian troops, including Interior Ministry
troops, are under the strict control of the military prosecutor's
office,'' said Alexander Mikhailov, a senior official at the
Russian government agency that organizes news coverage of the war.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The trouble in Alkhan-Yurt began after it was occupied by a
group of Islamic militants, including Chechen and Middle Eastern
fighters. Hoping to avoid a Russian attack on their settlement,
village elders sought to persuade the rebels to leave. They also
appealed to Gen. Vladimir Shamanov, the commander of the Western
Group of Forces, which had surrounded the town.
</P>
<P>
   But the militants threatened the villagers and insisted on
staying. Soon the town turned into a battleground. Russian forces
pummeled the town with artillery and then fought the militants for
control of the destroyed village.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers finally entered the village on Dec. 1 and appeared
to believe that the losses they had sustained in taking the town
gave them the right to loot it. The soldiers were ``kontraktniki,''
volunteers who join the Russian military for pay, residents say.
</P>
<P>
   The rampage continued for two weeks, but the villagers who fled
say the first five days were the worst. According to accounts by
Human Rights Watch, the Russian soldiers threw grenades into
civilian shelters and summarily executed villagers.
</P>
<P>
   Hanpasha Dudayev, 60, was one of the first to be killed. He was
shot when he tried to stop Russian troops from raiding his home in
what human rights workers said was a grisly pattern.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the Russian troops sought to prevent the villagers
from leaving. But three later bribed their way out and made their
way to Ingushetia, where talk about Alkhan-Yurt began to surface.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Malak Sidulayev, a millionaire Chechen
businessmen who comes from the town and supports the Russians in
the war, has sought to publicize the abuses. He arranged a visit by
the British Broadcasting Corp., which has asserted that more than
40 Chechens were killed by Russian troops.
</P>
<P>
   Sidulayev and Human Rights Watch say they believe that the
Russian military is investigating the episode. Human Rights Watch
has urged the United Nations to appoint an independent commission
to investigate human rights violations by Russian forces in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand that the military is now investigating what
happened, but it is imperative that international agencies also be
part of the investigation,'' Ms. Denber said.

 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    GUAMUCHIL, Mexico _ By now it is close to 4 a.m. in the outfield
of a small baseball park in the town of Guamuchil, located near the
Pacific Ocean in the Mexican state of Sinaloa. On stage, Los Tigres
del Norte are dressed in suits of turquoise satin and white fringe
and are bouncing through one of their popular `nortenos.'
 &HT;    In the outfield _ normally home to the `Garbanceros'
(Garbanzo-Bean Growers) _ hundreds of young people, primarily
teenage girls, crush together at stage front, mouthing lyrics to a
song recorded when most of them were in elementary school. Farther
back, older couples sashay to the polka beat. Nearby, chortling
along with Jorge Hernandez, Los Tigres' lead singer, groups of
reeling young men wearing white cowboy hats, silk shirts and cowboy
boots, are attempting to hold each other upright.
 &HT;    Fernando Cervantes, a young man standing unsteadily by the
stage, his eyes at half-mast, says, ``It's a miracle no one's
pulled a gun.''
 &HT;    The crowd of about 3,000 people is minuscule by Tigres'
standards. The group routinely plays crowds of 100,000 in Los
Angeles, Monterrey and Guatemala City. Lesser bands might even
consider it a step down. Yet the group plays Guamuchil every year.
Following a Tigres tour is to follow the spread of the Mexican
diaspora in North America: North Carolina, Tennessee, Minnesota,
Colorado, Oklahoma and, this year, Montreal, Canada, where a crowd
of 1,500 turned out.
 &HT;    This is the essence of the band, arguably one of North America's
most enduring pop acts ever. Remembering their roots and coming
back to play in towns like this have made Los Tigres _ four
brothers, a cousin and a friend who have played together now for 31
years _ the kings of Mexican pop.
 &HT;    Long before the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta)
forced Mexican companies to pay attention to their customers and
obsess about constant innovation, Los Tigres del Norte made it
their business to be available to their fans.
 &HT;    In Mexico, concerts begin at midnight and end when the crowd is
exhausted. Jorge Hernandez stops every show to take requests that
the audience scrawls on scrap paper and throws on stage _ a nightly
market survey. The band also breaks to take photos with fans who
line up backstage _ a source of income, since it charges for the
photos, and another way of maintaining contact with its consumers.
For this reason, the band's crowd is a regenerating crop of 18- to
25-year-olds, often children of its first fans, though half the
band members are well into their 40s.
 &HT;    Based on requests for ``El Triunfo'' off its new album,
``Herencia de Familia,'' the band recently decided to produce a
video based on the song. Tactics like these have led to the sales
of 30 million records. From Los Tigres' home base of San Jose,
California, they have also made 14 movies and won a Grammy. Many of
its tunes are now classics in Mexican popular music.
 &HT;    The band employs 34 people. Its logo is as well known as
Coca-Cola's in Mexico and Mexican communities in the United States.
The group tours 44 weeks a year, records albums when not on the
road and takes a break for only 4 weeks every year _ though the
band could have slowed down long ago. ``At first we never saw it as
a business,'' lead singer Jorge Hernandez says. ``I thought about
working, doing my art.''
 &HT;    Los Tigres emerged from a little-noticed migration starting in
the 1960s. As restless children in the United States were rebeling
through drugs and music, restless working-class Mexicans began
coming north. Their exodus was another rebellion of sorts. Mexico's
young were leaving corrupt Mexico, the Mexico that never gave a
poor man a chance, eager to re-create themselves in the fields and
restaurants of `Gringolandia.'
 &HT;    The irony was that in the United States these immigrants wanted
more than ever to be Mexican. They missed their `pueblo,'
girlfriend, Mom. Mostly, they asked from the United States what
Mexico never gave _ a chance to earn real money for hard work,
`progresar,' or advance.
 &HT;    As these immigrant numbers grew into one of the most important
cultural flows in the second half of this century, Los Tigres
became their chroniclers, spokesmen for a community largely
voiceless in both Mexico and the United States. The band's best
songs are stories distilling the essentials of Mexican
working-class life _ brutal machismo, piercing irony and the most
tender melodrama.
 &HT;    The group arrived in 1968, four kids at the border in Tijuana,
traveling with a music review contracted to play the Mexican
Independence Day parade in San Jose.
 &HT;    Because the oldest in the band was only 14, they had to convince
a middle-aged Mexican couple to pretend to be their parents. The
band had no name. But the immigration officer kept calling them
``little tigers.'' Because they were headed north and playing
`norteno' music, they became ``Los Tigres del Norte.''
 &HT;    Los Tigres never returned to Mexico to live. Their San Jose show
was broadcast over the radio and heard by Art Walker, an Englishman
who owned Fama Records, the first Spanish-language label in
California. Walker signed the band, gave the members music lessons
and suggested that they use electric instruments. ``We never
thought you could play `norteno' music with a full drum set and
electric bass,'' bass player Hernan Hernandez says. ``That was for
rock groups.''
 &HT;    Wiring up was the band's first of many important innovations to
`norteno' music, an accordion-based polka music indigenous to dusty
northern Mexico cantinas. Over the years, Los Tigres would infuse
the music with `boleros,' waltzes, `cumbias,' better recording
quality and sound effects such as machine guns and sirens to give
it an international pop style.
 &HT;    At that time, though, the band might have remained just another
cantina band were it not for a song that changed the group and
`norteno' music forever. In 1972, Los Tigres put out ``Contrabando
y Traicion'' (``Contraband and Betrayal''). The song tells the
story of a man and woman _ he an illegal, she a Chicana from Texas
_ smuggling marijuana from Tijuana to Los Angeles. After exchanging
the dope, the man says he's taking his share of the money and
visiting his girlfriend in San Francisco. However, his partner is
in love with him. Unwilling to share him, she shoots him and
disappears with the cash.
 &HT;    The song is a series of images _ news item fused with a twisted
love story _ that ends in sweet tragedy. ``It was like a film in
the mind's eye,'' Jorge Hernandez says. ``And it was the truth of
what was happening in those years. It spoke of the total chaos that
is drug trafficking. Perhaps, also, people had never heard these
things said so clearly in song.''
 &HT;    ``Contrabando'' was the first hit song about drug smuggling and
put Los Tigres on the map. It spawned two sequel songs and a movie.
Its two characters, Emilio Varela and Camelia La Tejana, are part
of every Mexican's cultural vocabulary. The band followed it with
``La Banda del Carro Rojo'' (``The Red Car Gang'') and dozens of
other ``narcocorridos,'' or drug ballads, over the years. Moreover,
the band awoke to the idea that news and song could work well
together.
 &HT;    The group stayed in tune with the concerns of the community and
the hits kept coming. In 1976, the band recorded ``Vivan Los
Mojados'' (``Long Live the Wetbacks''), an anthem to the importance
of immigrant labor to the United States. The Mexican immigrant
community sat up with a jolt. ``That's when we realized that there
was a market for this,'' Jorge Hernandez says. ``We began to see
that we needed to communicate with them.''
 &HT;    Immigrants bought records. They then took them home with them to
parts of Mexico where the band was unknown _ the Johnny Appleseeds
of Tigres music, as it were. After a first contact at a dance in
Bakersfield or Stockton, they took `norteno' music south into the
states of Michoacan and Guanajuato.
 &HT;    The band would return to the immigration theme as headlines
warranted, particularly as the U.S. Congress debated the 1986
immigrant-amnesty bill. Immigration provided Los Tigres with its
most bittersweet tunes: ``Pedro y Pablo,'' ``El Otro Mexico''
(``The Other Mexico''), ``Los Hijos de Hernandez'' (``The Sons of
Hernandez'') _ all dealing with the yearning to return home, love
lost through separation and the economic importance of immigrant
labor.
 &HT;    One song, ``La Jaula de Oro'' (``The Gold Cage''), recorded in
1984, is about an immigrant who's discovered he doesn't feel at
home in the country he tried so hard to enter. Even worse, his
children now speak English and reject their heritage. He aches to
return home but can't make a living in Mexico. It is a classic
Tigres tune, showing the band was keeping up with the concerns of
its public.
 &HT;    As civil war sent thousands of Central American immigrants to
the U.S., the band recorded ``Tres Veces Mojado'' (``Three Times a
Wetback'') _ a story of a Salvadoran refugee who crosses three
borders to get to America. The song made them heroes to Central
Americans. Los Tigres is still the only `norteno' band to regularly
play Guatemala City as well as Washington D.C. and Boston, U.S.
cities where Central Americans outnumber Mexicans.
 &HT;    Responding to California's Proposition 187, which would have
denied public health and education services to illegal immigrants
and their children if it hadn't been ruled unconstitutional in
1994, the band put several more immigrant ballads on its 1997
album, ``Jefe de Jefes'' (``Boss of Bosses''). ``El Mojado
Acaudalado'' (``The Wealthy Wetback'') is sung about a successful
immigrant who's going home with head held high. ``Mis Dos Patrias''
(``My Two Countries'') has a Mexican naturalizing, insisting that
he is not a traitor to his flag, that he's only protecting his
pension.
 &HT;    This year's ``Herencia de Familia'' has more than its share of
love songs, as if the band is willing to forget the Proposition 187
years, which weighed heavily on the band members and their public.
One heavily requested song is ``My Promise/Mi Promesa,'' sung in
English and Spanish _ a sign perhaps that the band's audience is
changing now that many immigrants have naturalized.
 &HT;    ``We try to analyze places we play. Sometimes people will yell
up to us, `Sing us a song about us,''' Jorge Hernandez says. ``It's
a form of perceiving the needs of those in the crowd.''

 &HT;    
 &HT;    GUAMUCHIL, Mexico _ By now it is close to 4 a.m. in the outfield
of a small baseball park in the town of Guamuchil, located near the
Pacific Ocean in the Mexican state of Sinaloa. On stage, Los Tigres
del Norte are dressed in suits of turquoise satin and white fringe
and are bouncing through one of their popular `nortenos.'
 &HT;    In the outfield _ normally home to the `Garbanceros'
(Garbanzo-Bean Growers) _ hundreds of young people, primarily
teenage girls, crush together at stage front, mouthing lyrics to a
song recorded when most of them were in elementary school. Farther
back, older couples sashay to the polka beat. Nearby, chortling
along with Jorge Hernandez, Los Tigres' lead singer, groups of
reeling young men wearing white cowboy hats, silk shirts and cowboy
boots, are attempting to hold each other upright.
 &HT;    Fernando Cervantes, a young man standing unsteadily by the
stage, his eyes at half-mast, says, ``It's a miracle no one's
pulled a gun.''
 &HT;    The crowd of about 3,000 people is minuscule by Tigres'
standards. The group routinely plays crowds of 100,000 in Los
Angeles, Monterrey and Guatemala City. Lesser bands might even
consider it a step down. Yet the group plays Guamuchil every year.
Following a Tigres tour is to follow the spread of the Mexican
diaspora in North America: North Carolina, Tennessee, Minnesota,
Colorado, Oklahoma and, this year, Montreal, Canada, where a crowd
of 1,500 turned out.
 &HT;    This is the essence of the band, arguably one of North America's
most enduring pop acts ever. Remembering their roots and coming
back to play in towns like this have made Los Tigres _ four
brothers, a cousin and a friend who have played together now for 31
years _ the kings of Mexican pop.
 &HT;    Long before the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta)
forced Mexican companies to pay attention to their customers and
obsess about constant innovation, Los Tigres del Norte made it
their business to be available to their fans.
 &HT;    In Mexico, concerts begin at midnight and end when the crowd is
exhausted. Jorge Hernandez stops every show to take requests that
the audience scrawls on scrap paper and throws on stage _ a nightly
market survey. The band also breaks to take photos with fans who
line up backstage _ a source of income, since it charges for the
photos, and another way of maintaining contact with its consumers.
For this reason, the band's crowd is a regenerating crop of 18- to
25-year-olds, often children of its first fans, though half the
band members are well into their 40s.
 &HT;    Based on requests for ``El Triunfo'' off its new album,
``Herencia de Familia,'' the band recently decided to produce a
video based on the song. Tactics like these have led to the sales
of 30 million records. From Los Tigres' home base of San Jose,
California, they have also made 14 movies and won a Grammy. Many of
its tunes are now classics in Mexican popular music.
 &HT;    The band employs 34 people. Its logo is as well known as
Coca-Cola's in Mexico and Mexican communities in the United States.
The group tours 44 weeks a year, records albums when not on the
road and takes a break for only 4 weeks every year _ though the
band could have slowed down long ago. ``At first we never saw it as
a business,'' lead singer Jorge Hernandez says. ``I thought about
working, doing my art.''
 &HT;    Los Tigres emerged from a little-noticed migration starting in
the 1960s. As restless children in the United States were rebeling
through drugs and music, restless working-class Mexicans began
coming north. Their exodus was another rebellion of sorts. Mexico's
young were leaving corrupt Mexico, the Mexico that never gave a
poor man a chance, eager to re-create themselves in the fields and
restaurants of `Gringolandia.'
 &HT;    The irony was that in the United States these immigrants wanted
more than ever to be Mexican. They missed their `pueblo,'
girlfriend, Mom. Mostly, they asked from the United States what
Mexico never gave _ a chance to earn real money for hard work,
`progresar,' or advance.
 &HT;    As these immigrant numbers grew into one of the most important
cultural flows in the second half of this century, Los Tigres
became their chroniclers, spokesmen for a community largely
voiceless in both Mexico and the United States. The band's best
songs are stories distilling the essentials of Mexican
working-class life _ brutal machismo, piercing irony and the most
tender melodrama.
 &HT;    The group arrived in 1968, four kids at the border in Tijuana,
traveling with a music review contracted to play the Mexican
Independence Day parade in San Jose.
 &HT;    Because the oldest in the band was only 14, they had to convince
a middle-aged Mexican couple to pretend to be their parents. The
band had no name. But the immigration officer kept calling them
``little tigers.'' Because they were headed north and playing
`norteno' music, they became ``Los Tigres del Norte.''
 &HT;    Los Tigres never returned to Mexico to live. Their San Jose show
was broadcast over the radio and heard by Art Walker, an Englishman
who owned Fama Records, the first Spanish-language label in
California. Walker signed the band, gave the members music lessons
and suggested that they use electric instruments. ``We never
thought you could play `norteno' music with a full drum set and
electric bass,'' bass player Hernan Hernandez says. ``That was for
rock groups.''
 &HT;    Wiring up was the band's first of many important innovations to
`norteno' music, an accordion-based polka music indigenous to dusty
northern Mexico cantinas. Over the years, Los Tigres would infuse
the music with `boleros,' waltzes, `cumbias,' better recording
quality and sound effects such as machine guns and sirens to give
it an international pop style.
 &HT;    At that time, though, the band might have remained just another
cantina band were it not for a song that changed the group and
`norteno' music forever. In 1972, Los Tigres put out ``Contrabando
y Traicion'' (``Contraband and Betrayal''). The song tells the
story of a man and woman _ he an illegal, she a Chicana from Texas
_ smuggling marijuana from Tijuana to Los Angeles. After exchanging
the dope, the man says he's taking his share of the money and
visiting his girlfriend in San Francisco. However, his partner is
in love with him. Unwilling to share him, she shoots him and
disappears with the cash.
 &HT;    The song is a series of images _ news item fused with a twisted
love story _ that ends in sweet tragedy. ``It was like a film in
the mind's eye,'' Jorge Hernandez says. ``And it was the truth of
what was happening in those years. It spoke of the total chaos that
is drug trafficking. Perhaps, also, people had never heard these
things said so clearly in song.''
 &HT;    ``Contrabando'' was the first hit song about drug smuggling and
put Los Tigres on the map. It spawned two sequel songs and a movie.
Its two characters, Emilio Varela and Camelia La Tejana, are part
of every Mexican's cultural vocabulary. The band followed it with
``La Banda del Carro Rojo'' (``The Red Car Gang'') and dozens of
other ``narcocorridos,'' or drug ballads, over the years. Moreover,
the band awoke to the idea that news and song could work well
together.
 &HT;    The group stayed in tune with the concerns of the community and
the hits kept coming. In 1976, the band recorded ``Vivan Los
Mojados'' (``Long Live the Wetbacks''), an anthem to the importance
of immigrant labor to the United States. The Mexican immigrant
community sat up with a jolt. ``That's when we realized that there
was a market for this,'' Jorge Hernandez says. ``We began to see
that we needed to communicate with them.''
 &HT;    Immigrants bought records. They then took them home with them to
parts of Mexico where the band was unknown _ the Johnny Appleseeds
of Tigres music, as it were. After a first contact at a dance in
Bakersfield or Stockton, they took `norteno' music south into the
states of Michoacan and Guanajuato.
 &HT;    The band would return to the immigration theme as headlines
warranted, particularly as the U.S. Congress debated the 1986
immigrant-amnesty bill. Immigration provided Los Tigres with its
most bittersweet tunes: ``Pedro y Pablo,'' ``El Otro Mexico''
(``The Other Mexico''), ``Los Hijos de Hernandez'' (``The Sons of
Hernandez'') _ all dealing with the yearning to return home, love
lost through separation and the economic importance of immigrant
labor.
 &HT;    One song, ``La Jaula de Oro'' (``The Gold Cage''), recorded in
1984, is about an immigrant who's discovered he doesn't feel at
home in the country he tried so hard to enter. Even worse, his
children now speak English and reject their heritage. He aches to
return home but can't make a living in Mexico. It is a classic
Tigres tune, showing the band was keeping up with the concerns of
its public.
 &HT;    As civil war sent thousands of Central American immigrants to
the U.S., the band recorded ``Tres Veces Mojado'' (``Three Times a
Wetback'') _ a story of a Salvadoran refugee who crosses three
borders to get to America. The song made them heroes to Central
Americans. Los Tigres is still the only `norteno' band to regularly
play Guatemala City as well as Washington D.C. and Boston, U.S.
cities where Central Americans outnumber Mexicans.
 &HT;    Responding to California's Proposition 187, which would have
denied public health and education services to illegal immigrants
and their children if it hadn't been ruled unconstitutional in
1994, the band put several more immigrant ballads on its 1997
album, ``Jefe de Jefes'' (``Boss of Bosses''). ``El Mojado
Acaudalado'' (``The Wealthy Wetback'') is sung about a successful
immigrant who's going home with head held high. ``Mis Dos Patrias''
(``My Two Countries'') has a Mexican naturalizing, insisting that
he is not a traitor to his flag, that he's only protecting his
pension.
 &HT;    This year's ``Herencia de Familia'' has more than its share of
love songs, as if the band is willing to forget the Proposition 187
years, which weighed heavily on the band members and their public.
One heavily requested song is ``My Promise/Mi Promesa,'' sung in
English and Spanish _ a sign perhaps that the band's audience is
changing now that many immigrants have naturalized.
 &HT;    ``We try to analyze places we play. Sometimes people will yell
up to us, `Sing us a song about us,''' Jorge Hernandez says. ``It's
a form of perceiving the needs of those in the crowd.''

   NEW YORK _ Here's a little post-holiday exercise for your
amusement: grab pen and paper and jot down your 10 favorite songs
dating from 1955 to now. Ponder carefully, or don't, depending on
whether you think music should be judged by the brain or the gut.
Call five friends and read them your list. Set up a date to argue
about it, to spin CDs and scream and shout. When you've done that,
you will have helped shape the rock 'n' roll canon.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always ask, how did the songs get in the hymnal? How do
they make that step?'' said the multi-instrumentalist and
songwriter Peter Holsapple, who helped decide which rock-era songs
could stand next to the likes of ``Take Me Out to the Ball Game''
and ``Summertime'' as the band leader at the year-ending ``Songs of
the Century'' program for arts at St. Ann's in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The great works of any art form are supposed to reveal its
potential. Shakespeare makes us realize how a play can encapsulate
a world. Picasso helps us ponder the fundamentals of seeing. And
despite recent scrutiny by those seeking to expand them, the canons
these artists occupy remain fairly solid. What orchestra doesn't
play the works of Beethoven and Brahms? Even other popular music
genres have their songbooks _ jazz players and cabaret vocalists
converse through standards, their experiments starting from the
same place.
</P>
<P>
   But the best of rock 'n' roll and its siblings, rhythm and blues
and rap, is messier, and always more in dispute. Its landmarks are
often beloved and despised in equal measure, like Led Zeppelin's
fairy-tale opus, ``Stairway to Heaven,'' or most of Elvis' oeuvre.
Even seemingly unbesmirched winners like Bob Dylan face detractors
who dismiss the whole ``classic'' era of the 1960s and hold up
canons full of disco-flavored cheese or obscure garage rock as the
real thing.
</P>
<P>
   Would-be canonizers, and every fan is one, can't even agree on
basic criteria. Rhythmic innovation matters to some, while others
live for the virtuoso guitar solo. Cultists argue for the bohemian
poeticism of artists like Patti Smith, while populists scorn such
pretensions. As for a work's influence, if you're a devotee of
funk, then the Beatles don't matter. If you're a power pop lover,
they're everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I learned most of all was that rock and soul is as
complex and self-contradictory as any living thing,'' critic Dave
Marsh wrote in the definitive work of rock 'n' roll canonizing, his
1989 book ``The Heart of Rock and Soul: the 1001 Greatest Singles
Ever Made.'' The movement is definitely afoot to establish a rock
'n' roll canon, but these efforts never feel complete, to the
credit of the music and its culture. To be a rock or rap or soul
fan is to make an argument. Perhaps the first one is with your
parents, who tell you to turn down that wretched music, but soon
after come the debates with pals who form tribes around their
favorite music styles. Because this intense, if sometimes
delusional, sense of individualism rules rock 'n' roll culture, its
canon is always exploding.
</P>
<P>
   Even the closest thing to an official list, the Rock and Roll
Hall of Fame's exhibit on the 500 most influential songs, seems
designed to stimulate contention. The exhibit, an interactive
display that allows museumgoers to listen to the tracks, includes
often-scorned fare like Duran Duran's ``Hungry Like the Wolf'' and
``U Can't Touch This,'' the M.C. Hammer song that many hip-hop
acolytes think virtually destroyed rap in the 1980s. The Rock Hall
maintains a lively online forum about the songs, allowing fans to
dissect the song list and suggest their own additions. Lightly
regarded artists like Grand Funk Railroad find their defenders,
while critical sacred cows like the Velvet Underground suffer the
jibes of the unconverted.
</P>
<P>
   The positive collision of values is what's made American
culture,'' said former Living Color guitarist Vernon Reid, who has
played rock canonizer at all-star events like this month's tribute
to Prince's 1982 album ``1999'' at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.
``It's the kind of thing where the snake eats its tail and likes
the taste.''
</P>
<P>
   Rock 'n' roll was born at a violated boundary _ between white
and black, rural and urban, commercial and folk _ and even into
middle age, the music thrives on the confusion of the busy
crossroads. Popular charts, industry-based awards and critical
writings compete with equally influential informal forces. Cover
bands maintain the lifespan of songs never nominated for a Grammy;
karaoke singers choose tracks journalists despise. Cultists make
their own collections of obscurities: lounge music revivalists
lionize Martin Denny, while hardcore punks admire Bad Brains.
</P>
<P>
   From these viewpoints a glorious yelling match about greatness
ensues, and those who dare to present their canons in public can
only try to regulate the din. The ``Songs of the Century'' program
at St. Ann's was staged like a classical recital, with five singers
_ Marshall Crenshaw, Jimmie Dale Gilmore, Sandra St. Victor, Beth
Orton and Martha Wainwright _ taking turns in front of a full band.
Holsapple and the night's other curators favored familiar choices,
like ``Blowin' in the Wind.'' Then they threw in a few surprises,
to represent rock's idiosyncratic edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were changing songs until an hour and a half before the
show,'' said Holsapple. ``It could have easily been a show of
standards, kind of a lounge thing, like Bill Murray singing
`Imagine' on `Saturday Night Live.' So it was important to also do
`I Just Wasn't Made for These Times.'''
</P>
<P>
   Such a comment suggests another central debate about whether
singles or albums represent the best of rock. As fine as it is, ``I
Just Wasn't Made for These Times'' is certainly not the most famous
or most perfectly rendered Beach Boys song. Yet many would canonize
it because it appears on the 1966 album ``Pet Sounds,'' which they
consider the Beach Boys' masterpiece, arguing that a classic album
carries more weight than even its own greatest single.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Events like the BAM performance of Prince's ``1999,'' with
singers like Joan Osborne, Corey Glover, Angelique Kidjo and Toshi
Reagon performing the double record in its original sequence, are
making albums seem like rock's equivalent to oratorios. ``The
album, as a form, is very important,'' said Reid. ``It is a song
cycle. There are climaxes and points where the record takes a left
turn; these are crucial things.''
</P>
<P>
   Some rock canonizers avoid this argument by including albums and
singles on their lists. National Public Radio's recently released
compilation of the 100 most important musical works of the century,
to be presented in segments on ``All Things Considered'' and
``Weekend Edition'' throughout the next year, includes nearly every
format and style of American music from modernist symphonies to
two-minute punk songs.
</P>
<P>
   The NPR list was selected by critics, fans and songwriters. Yet
Elizabeth Blair, the producer who coordinated the project, still
wonders if such a list can be truly representative. ``You can't
make a rock canon, because the industry is controlled. Even in the
'50s it was controlled, by company executives, critics and media
program directors,'' she said, neatly implicating herself.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that the demands of business and the tastes of
executives have long affected what music reaches the public. Yet
industry-generated lists can seem as idiosyncratic as those of the
oddest fan, as they cross the borders between good and bad taste.
</P>
<P>
   BMI, which, along with ASCAP, is one of the country's main music
performing rights organizations, recently tallied the contemporary
songs most played on television and radio and in film. No. 1 was
``You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin','' the booming plea for love sung
by the Righteous Brothers, produced by Phil Spector and written by
the stellar team of Barry Mann and Cynthia Weill.
</P>
<P>
   That song is a fairly indisputable work of genius. At its heels,
however, is the wedding reception favorite ``Never My Love'' by the
Association, a group that sounded more like youth choir Up With
People than the Beatles, who occupy the third spot with
``Yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   The BMI list continues this way, with schmaltzy soft rockers
holding their own against the milestones of rock and soul. One-hit
wonder Merilee Rush rates higher with ``Angel of the Morning'' than
the Supremes and Roy Orbison. The highest-ranking Elvis Presley
song isn't ``Hound Dog'' but ``Suspicious Minds.'' ``(I Can't Get
No) Satisfaction'' squeaks in at 91, ahead of its fellow classics
``Layla'' (93) and ``Imagine'' (96).
</P>
<P>
   The wildly varying quality on the BMI list may seem to confirm
the tendency of music programmers to promote watered-down product.
But consider another roster, this one determined strictly by fans.
``Karaoke's All Time Top 10,'' published online by Karaoke Scene
magazine, is a veritable exaltation of corn. Its critically lauded
songs, like the Patsy Cline tearjerker ``Crazy,'' are worn to the
bone. The rest is pure camp, whether deliberately fashioned, like
``Love Shack'' by the B-52s and ``YMCA'' by the Village People, or
made so by history, like Bette Midler's hyperbolic weeper ``The
Rose.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People are soppy creatures,'' said Gary Stewart, senior vice
president of Rhino Records, the leading label for anthologies.
``Ballads aren't better, but sometimes things that burn bright
don't burn long, and vice versa. I know that there's some music I
could never listen to again in the same way. Like the first Sex
Pistols record and the Clash and the early Who. Those records meant
more to me than any music did at the time. But then there are
perennials that didn't go as deep. Ballads go wide, but not deep.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart and his colleagues at Rhino have created an aesthetic
that jumps from wide to deep to reflect the rock era's intersecting
forces of silliness and profundity. The label's mid-1990s ``Have a
Nice Day'' series exhaustively chronicled pop in the 1970s, just as
that era was being reassessed by young connoisseurs who related
more to the glistening schmaltz of Sweden's Abba than the
overexposed relevance of the Rolling Stones.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart said that the interplay between pop's familiar center
and its hidden corners made anthologizing effective. ``I am against
obscurity for its own sake,'' he said. ``What's exciting to me is
finding the album cuts and the singles and the unreleased tracks
that make people say: `That's great! Why wasn't that a hit?'''
</P>
<P>
   Rhino's playful approach emphasizes the treasure-hunting spirit
that remains a key to the fan's experience of rock. Some collectors
lionize artists who have been kept from the spotlight by bad luck
or the challenging nature of their music. Less scholarly listeners
also find their treasures, often right out in the open. They create
private canons by using music in their daily lives and by
justifying their choices to their friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``The List,'' a popular new program on VH-1, captures that
process. It features celebrities, many hardly music experts,
arguing for their favorites in a given category: Best Love Song,
Sexiest Female Singer, Best Heavy Metal Group. The show evolved
from an older and far less successful program, ``Four on the
Floor,'' which had critics debating the merits of new releases.
``The List'' kept the spirit of argument but emphasized more
individual viewpoints.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized fun was more important than making the ultimate
list,'' said Jeff Gaspin, executive vice president of programming
at VH-1. ``Music is so personal _ that's what people want to share,
their personal tastes.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR;  &LR; (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Although legendary figures like John Lennon and Jimi Hendrix get
their due on ``The List,'' the show also tends to elevate current
artists and songs, reflecting the relative youth of the panelists.
The show's emphasis on what's hot right now reinforces another
truth about how people experience pop: what they think is classic
changes from year to year. Popular music is an art form people use
informally. Most don't study it in school or turn to it for
edification, as a reading group might turn to Henry James. People
use pop to get hyped up for an evening out, warm up a lover or have
a good cry.
</P>
<P>
   Most musicians also teach themselves a repertory ruled by their
personal tastes. Vernon Reid mastered guitar by playing along to
Santana's ``Caravanserai.'' Peter Holsapple learned songcraft from
the Beatles. ``They spoke to me as a child, as a teen-ager,'' he
said. ``I'm a middle-aged guy now; they're still talking to me.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, popular music itself contains a secret canon, as
musicians interpolate themes from old favorites into their own
songs without necessarily treating them like standards. Nowhere is
this approach more influential than in hip-hop, a genre literally
built from sonic fragments.
</P>
<P>
   There was a songbook, and it's called `Ultimate Breaks and
Beats,''' said ``Chairman'' Jefferson Mao, an editor at the rap
magazine Ego Trip and a co-editor of its just-published ``Ego
Trip's Book of Rap Lists.'' Mao was referring to a 25-volume album
series compiling the most frequently used breakbeats, or snippets
of songs, used by hip-hop DJs to construct their musical collages.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the 150 cuts on these albums, like ``Funky President''
by James Brown, are well-regarded, while others, like ``Apache'' by
the Incredible Bongo Band, are barely known. But each contained a
guitar lick, vocal whoop or drum roll that became part of hip-hop's
alphabet.
</P>
<P>
   After Lenny Roberts, an amateur collector, and the DJ Afrika
Bambaataa began assembling these anthologies in 1986, the treasure
hunt of hip-hop became a much easier game. ``There are songs that,
if you dissect the samples, they are all from volume such and
such,'' said Mao. ``People found a way to mix them in one song.
It's like using `l-m-n-o' as one letter. But they still were able
to flip it in a creative way.''
</P>
<P>
   With DJs besting each other with original twists on the same
breakbeats, hip-hop became an art of references. Although copyright
restrictions that arose when original artists started suing DJs
have limited the number of samples used, a trend classicists like
Mao deeply regret, the craft of crooked assembly still dominates
hip-hop's adventurous edge.
</P>
<P>
   Now that hip-hop is a quarter century old, it is being
institutionalized, like rock before it. The Ego Trip book is part
of that process, along with the publication of ``The Vibe History
of Hip-Hop'' and the major exhibit on the subject staged at the
Rock Hall this year. Yet Mao let forth a scornful laugh at the idea
there could ever be a definitive hip-hop canon.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way to do that,'' he said. ``We did lists of the
greatest MCs and producers. We didn't want to, but people would be
beefing.'' Readers wanted those lists, he said, so they could rip
them apart. ``Everyone wants to argue. Hip-hop and rap, it's all
debate.'' So the canon-making continues, in the tradition of all
the loudmouths who've loved rock 'n' roll.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    GUAMUCHIL, Mexico _ Son casi las 4 de la manana. En un pequeno
parque beisbolero del pueblo de Guamuchil, cerca del oceano
Pacifico, en el estado mexicano de Sinaloa, los Tigres del Norte
interpretan uno de sus populares nortenos. Visten trajes de satin
azul turquesa, con bordes blancos.
 &HT;    En el terreno (sede de los Garbanceros) cientos de jovenes, en
su mayoria muchachas, se amontonan al pie del escenario, coreando
la letra de una cancion grabada cuando casi todas estaban en la
escuela primaria. Al fondo, las parejas mayores bailan al ritmo de
la polca. Cerca, riendose junto con Jorge Hernandez, el principal
cantante de Los Tigres, varios jovenes pasados de tragos, vestidos
con camisas de seda, botas y sombreros blancos de vaquero, tratan
de mantenerse erguidos.
 &HT;    Fernando Cervantes, un joven que se tambalea en el escenario,
con los ojos caidos, dice: ``Es un milagro que nadie haya sacado
una pistola.''
 &HT;    La multitud de unas 3.000 personas es minuscula para los Tigres.
El grupo suele atraer multitudes de 100.000 personas en Los
Angeles, Monterrey y Ciudad Guatemala. Incluso bandas musicales
menores considerarian pequena la cifra. Pero el grupo actua todos
los anos en Guamuchil. Las giras de los Tigres siguen la ruta de la
diaspora mexicana en Norteamerica: Carolina del Norte, Tennessee,
Minnesota, Colorado, Oklahoma y, este ano, Montreal, en Canada,
donde se congregaron 1.500 fanaticos.
 &HT;    Esta es la esencia de la banda, una de las mas duraderas de la
musica pop en Norteamerica. Recordar sus raices y regresar a tocar
en pueblos como este han convertido a los Tigres (cuatro hermanos,
un primo y un amigo que tocan juntos desde hace 31 anos) en los
reyes del pop mexicano.
 &HT;    Mucho antes de que el Tratado de Libre Comercio de America del
Norte (TLC) obligara a las companias mexicanas a prestar atencion a
sus clientes y les inculcara la obsesion de la innovacion
constante, los Tigres del Norte pusieron su negocio a disposicion
de sus fanaticos.
 &HT;    En Mexico, sus conciertos comienzan a medianoche, cuando la
multitud esta exhausta. Jorge Hernandez hace un alto en todos los
espectaculos para que el publico pida canciones en pedazos de papel
que tiran al escenario, en una especie de encuesta nocturna de
mercado. La banda tambien se toma fotos con los fanaticos que hacen
cola al fondo del escenario. Es una fuente de ingresos, ya que
cobran por las fotos, y tambien una forma de mantener el contacto
con sus consumidores. Por esta razon, los seguidores de la banda
son una muchedumbre entre los 18 y los 25 anos, que se renueva
constantemente, muchas veces hijos de los primeros fans, aunque la
mitad de los miembros del grupo musical ronda los 45 anos.
 &HT;    Observando las numerosas peticiones de ``El Triunfo,'' una
melodia de su nuevo album, ``Herencia de Familia,'' la banda
decidio recientemente producir un video basado en la cancion.
Tacticas como estas han llevado a la venta de 30 millones de
discos. Desde su sede en San Jose, California, los Tigres tambien
han hecho 14 peliculas y han ganado un premio Grammy. Muchas de sus
melodias se han convertido en clasicos de la musica popular
mexicana.
 &HT;    La banda emplea a 34 personas. Su logo es tan conocido en Mexico
y en las comunidades mexicanas de Estados Unidos como el de la
Coca-Cola. El grupo esta de gira 44 semanas al ano, graba albumes
cuando no esta de gira y se toma un descanso de cuatro semanas cada
ano, aunque hace tiempo que la banda podria reducir su actividad.
``Al principio no lo consideramos un negocio,'' dice Jorge
Hernandez, el cantante principal. ``Lo que queria era trabajar,
desarrollar mi arte.''
 &HT;    Los Tigres emergieron de una emigracion casi inadvertida que
comenzo en los anos 60. Mientras los inquietos jovenes
norteamericanos expresaban su rebelion con las drogas y la musica,
los inquietos trabajadores mexicanos avanzaron hacia el norte.
 &HT;    Su exodo fue otra especie de rebelion. Los jovenes mexicanos
dejaban atras el Mexico corrupto, un pais donde los pobres no
tenian oportunidades, deseosos de rehacer sus vidas en los campos y
los restaurantes de Gringolandia. Ironicamente, en Estados Unidos
estos inmigrantes querian mas que nunca ser mexicanos. Extranaban a
su pueblo, a una novia, a su madre. Le pedian a Estados Unidos lo
que Mexico nunca les dio: una oportunidad de ganar dinero de verdad
con su trabajo duro, una oportunidad de progresar.
 &HT;    Cuando esta llegada de inmigrantes se convirtio en uno de los
flujos culturales mas importantes de la segunda mitad de este
siglo, los Tigres se convirtieron en sus cronistas, voceros de una
comunidad que en su mayor parte carecia de voz, tanto en Mexico
como en Estados Unidos. Las mejores canciones de la banda son
historias que reflejan los elementos esenciales de la vida de la
clase trabajadora de Mexico: un machismo brutal, una ironia
penetrante y un conmovedor melodrama.
 &HT;    El grupo llego en 1968. Eran cuatro chiquillos en la frontera,
en Tijuana, que viajaban con una revista musical contratada para
actuar en el desfile del Dia de la Independencia de Mexico en San
Jose.
 &HT;    Como el mayor de la banda solo tenia 14 anos, tuvieron que
convencer a una pareja mexicana de mediana edad para que fingieran
ser sus padres. La banda no tenia nombre. Pero el funcionario de
inmigracion los llamaba ``los tigrecitos.'' Como se dirigian al
norte y tocaban musica nortena, se convirtieron en los Tigres del
Norte.
 &HT;    Los Tigres nunca regresaron a vivir en Mexico. Su programa de
San Jose se transmitia por la radio y un dia lo oyo Art Walker, un
ingles propietario de Fama Records, la primera marca disquera en
espanol de California. Walker contrato a la banda, les dio a sus
miembros lecciones de musica y sugirio que usaran instrumentos
electricos. ``Nunca pensamos que se pudiera tocar musica nortena
con una bateria y un bajo electrico,'' dice Hernan Hernandez,
bajista del grupo.
 &HT;    Los instrumentos electricos fueron la primera de una serie de
importantes innovaciones de la banda a la musica nortena, que es
una polca tocada con acordeon, propia de las polvorientas cantinas
del norte de Mexico. Con el paso de los anos, los Tigres
incorporaron a ese tipo de musica boleros, valses, cumbias, una
grabacion de mejor calidad y efectos de sonido como ametralladoras
y sirenas para darle un estilo de pop internacional.
 &HT;    Sin embargo, en esa epoca la banda quiza no hubiera dejado de
ser una simple banda de cantina mas de no haber sido por una
cancion que cambio para siempre al grupo y a la musica nortena. En
1972, Los Tigres estrenaron ``Contrabando y traicion,'' que relata
la historia de un hombre y una mujer (el, un inmigrante ilegal, y
ella una chicana de Texas) que contrabandean marihuana de Tijuana a
Los Angeles. Despues de cambiar la droga, el hombre dice que se va
con su dinero a visitar a su novia en San Francisco. Pero su
asociada lo ama y por celos le dispara y se va con el dinero.
 &HT;    La cancion es una serie de imagenes, noticias vinculadas a una
loca historia de amor de tragico final. ``La vimos como una
pelicula,'' dice Jorge Hernandez. ``Y era la realidad, lo que
pasaba en esos anos. Hablaba del caos total que es el narcotrafico.
Es posible que la gente nunca hubiera oido hablar de esas cosas tan
claramente en una cancion.''
 &HT;    ``Contrabando'' fue la primera cancion exitosa sobre el
contrabando de drogas, puso a Los Tigres en las candilejas e
inspiro otras dos canciones y una pelicula. Sus dos personajes,
Emilio Varela y Camelia la Tejana, forman parte del lexico cultural
mexicano. El grupo siguio con ``La banda del carro rojo'' y decenas
de narcocorridos mas. Ademas, los musicos advirtieron que las
noticias y las canciones podian ir de la mano.
 &HT;    El grupo siguio tomandole el pulso a la poblacion mexicana de
Estados Unidos y los exitos se sucedieron. En 1976, la banda grabo
``Vivan los mojados,'' un himno a la importancia de la mano de obra
inmigrante en Estados Unidos. Fue una conmocion entre los
inmigrantes mexicanos. ``Entonces fue cuando advertimos que habia
un mercado para esta musica,'' dice Jorge Hernandez.
 &HT;    Los inmigrantes compraban los discos y los llevaban a Mexico, a
partes del pais donde no se conocia a la banda.
 &HT;    La banda volvio a tocar el tema de la inmigracion cuando los
titulares volvieron a recogerlo, sobre todo cuando el Congreso
norteamericano debatio la ley de amnistia a la inmigracion ilegal
en 1986. La inmigracion inspiro a Los Tigres sus melodias mas
conmovedoras: ``Pedro y Pablo,'' ``El otro Mexico,'' ``Los hijos de
Hernandez,'' todas sobre el ansia de regresar, sobre amores
destrozados por la separacion y sobre la importancia economica de
la mano de obra inmigrante.
 &HT;    Una cancion, ``La jaula de oro,'' grabada en 1984, trata sobre
un inmigrante que descubre que se siente ajeno en el pais al que
con tanto afan queria llegar. Todavia peor, sus hijos hablan ingles
y rechazan sus raices. Quiere volver a su patria pero no puede
ganarse la vida en Mexico. Es un tema clasico de Los Tigres, que
muestra que la banda reflejaba las inquietudes de su publico.
 &HT;    Cuando la guerra civil envio a miles de inmigrantes
centroamericanos a Estados Unidos, la banda grabo ``Tres veces
mojado,'' la historia de un refugiado salvadoreno que cruza tres
fronteras para llegar a Estados Unidos. La cancion puso a los
centroamericanos como heroes. Los Tigres todavia son la unica banda
de musica nortena que actua habitualmente en Ciudad Guatemala asi
como en Washington y Boston, las ciudades estadounidenses donde los
centroamericanos superan en numero a los mexicanos.
 &HT;    En respuesta a la Proposicion 187 de California, que le habria
negado atencion medica y educacion publica a los inmigrantes
ilegales y a sus hijos, y que en 1994 se declaro inconstitucional,
la bada compuso mas baladas sobre inmigrantes en su album de 1997,
``Jefe de jefes.'' ``El mojado acaudalado'' es sobre un inmigrante
exitoso que regresa a su pais con la frente en alto. ``Mis dos
patrias'' trata sobre un mexicano que adquiere la ciudadania
estadounidense y que reitera que no es un traidor a su bandera, que
solo quiere proteger su pension.
 &HT;    ``Herencia de familia,'' de este ano, tiene sobre todo canciones
de amor, como si la banda estuviera dispuesta a olvidar los anos de
la Proposicion 187, que ejercieron una gran influencia en los
miembros del grupo y en su publico. Una cancion muy solicitada es
``My Promise/Mi promesa,'' cantada en ingles y en espanol, quiza
una senal de que el publico de la banda esta cambiando ahora que
muchos inmigrantes se han hecho ciudadanos estadounidenses.
 &HT;    ``Tratamos de analizar los lugares donde actuamos. A veces la
gente nos grita: Canten sobre nosotros,'' dice Jorge Hernandez.
``Es una manera de percibir lo que quiere la multitud.''

de musica nortena que actua habitualmente en Ciudad Guatemala asi
como en Washington y Boston, las ciudades estadounidenses donde los
centroamericanos superan en numero a los mexicanos.
 &HT;    En respuesta a la Proposicion 187 de California, que le habria
negado atencion medica y educacion publica a los inmigrantes
ilegales y a sus hijos, y que en 1994 se declaro inconstitucional,
la bada compuso mas baladas sobre inmigrantes en su album de 1997,
``Jefe de jefes.'' ``El mojado acaudalado'' es sobre un inmigrante
exitoso que regresa a su pais con la frente en alto. ``Mis dos
patrias'' trata sobre un mexicano que adquiere la ciudadania
estadounidense y que reitera que no es un traidor a su bandera, que
solo quiere proteger su pension.
 &HT;    ``Herencia de familia,'' de este ano, tiene sobre todo canciones
de amor, como si la banda estuviera dispuesta a olvidar los anos de
la Proposicion 187, que ejercieron una gran influencia en los
miembros del grupo y en su publico. Una cancion muy solicitada es
``My Promise/Mi promesa,'' cantada en ingles y en espanol, quiza
una senal de que el publico de la banda esta cambiando ahora que
muchos inmigrantes se han hecho ciudadanos estadounidenses.
 &HT;    ``Tratamos de analizar los lugares donde actuamos. A veces la
gente nos grita: Canten sobre nosotros,'' dice Jorge Hernandez.
``Es una manera de percibir lo que quiere la multitud.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If it's December, we must be in Los Angeles. Which
means this year, at least, Cameron Teitelman will be home for the
holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Since joining the national tour of ``Les Miserables'' in July,
the 11- year-old Calabasas resident has traveled to Canada, across
the United States and back. He began in Washington, D.C. _ where he
performed at a private function for U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein,
D-Calif., then it was on to Montreal, Cleveland, Spokane, Portland,
Tempe, San Diego, Sacramento, Fresno, Colorado Springs...
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of cities,'' says the dark-haired Cameron, with a grin.
``I still feel more like I'm home here (in L.A.). I get to wake up
in my own bed, play with my own computer and my own toys. That kind
of stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Les Miserables,'' Cameron plays Gavroche, the resourceful
street urchin who lives by his wits and joins the student revolt
along the barricades in 1832 Paris. Gavroche _ a scene-stealer of a
role _ has a couple of musical solos, as well as a memorable, er,
exit scene that is Cameron's favorite part of the show. ``Les Miz''
plays at the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles through Feb. 12 before
heading to Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron works every other performance, sharing the role with
Christopher Carlson, who has become Cameron's new best friend. Also
on the tour are the two girls who play young versions of heroines
Cosette and Eponine, and a teacher travels along to make sure that
everybody keeps up with school work. Cameron's father, Sanford, a
television producer, travels with Cameron on the tour. On the road,
mom Judy, brother Brandon and kid sister Marissa visit whenever and
wherever possible.
</P>
<P>
   But this is no extended holiday for Cameron. He finds himself up
and in school at the theater by 11 a.m. Then it's dinner, and back
to the theater by 7 p.m. His day is done by 11 p.m, a couple of
hours sooner on the nights when Christopher Carlson performs.
</P>
<P>
   That's eight performances, six days a week, day in and day out,
from city to city, a schedule some kids his age might find a bit
trying. But Cameron is having a blast. Besides, in the Teitelman
family, where everybody except Sanford is a performer, there was no
thought about turning down a gig like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the call came that Cameron got the part,'' says Sanford
Teitelman, ``in that split instant, my wife acknowledged that `Yes,
he will go, he will do well, and we will live with it. And by the
way, Sandy, you're going to do the tour with him.' So I was
drafted.''
</P>
<P>
   The tour has no ending date, which means that Cameron can face
the bullets on the barricades as long as he's under 55 inches or
until he wants to quit. To hear him talk about his travels and the
friendships with fellow cast and crew members, Cameron seems in no
hurry to outgrow Gavroche's rags.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love this show. I love this show so much. When I first saw
it, I was dazzled. I was like, `Oh my gosh!''' says Cameron, who
saw two movie versions of ``Les Miserables'' before auditioning.
``Even when I went on audition, I was really excited. I am so lucky
to have gotten this part.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's Ts.HX6

COMMENTARY: ISRAEL'S SHAME 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Li Peng, China's hardest-line Communist leader _
the man famed for ordering the Tiananmen massacre _ was feted in
Israel this month.
</P>
<P>
   After a visit to the Holocaust memorial, foreign ministry
officials took him to the Israeli Aircraft Industries facility near
Ben-Gurion Airport. He inspected a Russian-built plane, owned by
the Chinese, on which Israel is installing an advanced AWACS
battle-management system called the Phalcon.
</P>
<P>
   Israel is charging a quarter of a billion dollars for the aerial
reconnaissance radar installation, and has a contract for three
more. It's a lucrative deal. It may also be the biggest
geopolitical blunder any Israeli government ever made.
</P>
<P>
   Free Chinese on Taiwan have no such high-altitude early warning
system. Combined with the new long-range and surface-to-air
missiles being installed by the PRC in Zhangzhou, China's Israeli
purchases will give it a ``qualitative edge'' in any military
confrontation in the Taiwan Strait. That would include, of course,
new ability for China to look down on and target any U.S. warships
sent to discourage invasion.
</P>
<P>
   Why is Israel, a small democratic nation threatened by powerful
neighbors, helping to menace Taiwan, another small democratic
nation threatened by a nearby tyranny?
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak has been ducking me on this (Shimon
Peres and Yitzhak Rabin were more courageous about facing
embarrassing questions), but here are the reasons behind Israel's
amoral policy:
</P>
<P>
   1. Arms exports enable Israel to improve its own defenses.
Besides, America's Boeing and Loral have done more to build
Beijing's military than all other nations combined.
</P>
<P>
   2. China offers a huge market for Israeli technology; moreover,
its position on the U.N. Security Council offers big-power
diplomatic engagement long limited to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   3. Israel has avoided the transfer of technology it received
from the United States to any third party without clearance;
Phalcon avionics were Israeli-developed. And the United States for
years did not object to Israel's efforts to follow the United
States into the Chinese arms market.
</P>
<P>
   4. China's vast network of human intelligence agents can, better
than U.S. satellites, relay secret information to Israel about
North Korea's sales of missiles to Iraq and Russia's nuclear
development of Iran.
</P>
<P>
   That's the case for Israel's supply alliance with China against
Taiwan. Here is the case against:
</P>
<P>
   This flies directly in the face of U.S. security interests. When
China last threatened Taiwan, President Clinton was forced to put
two U.S. aircraft carriers into the strait. When that happens
again, American forces will be directly threatened by Chinese air,
naval and missile forces emboldened by Israel's Phalcon battle
management.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the Senate Foreign Relations chairman, Jesse Helms,
long a supporter of Israel, wrote to its government privately on
Nov. 17: ``The Pentagon has informed me that this system may be
more advanced than the U.S. AWACS and will definitely enhance
China's power projection capabilities ... U.S. security will be put
at risk by the Phalcon and other Israeli sales to Beijing.''
</P>
<P>
   Though candidates for U.S. president today are fearful of
raising this question, American supporters of Israel want to know:
If Israel tips the technological military balance against a
democratic American ally in Asia, why should the United States
guarantee that Israel continue to have a ``qualitative edge'' in
the Middle East?
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Cold War, Israel and America were together on the
side of freedom. In the coming superpower rivalry in Asia, will
Israel choose neutralism? And when the multibillion-dollar bill
comes in to subsidize a settlement with Syrians and Palestinians,
will Israel's prime minister seek economic aid from his big new
Asian customer?
</P>
<P>
   Let's talk tachlis, Yiddish for ``brass tacks'': If the freedom
of an island with 22 million souls is of no concern to Israel, the
world will care even less about 6 million Jews getting pushed into
the sea. Israeli survival has one dependable guarantor, and the
powerful U.S.-Israel alliance is nothing without its moral
dimension.
</P>
<P>
   That's why some of us hope that after being shown around the
Holocaust museum and the Phalcon plant, the ``butcher of Beijing''
did not get an idea for the final solution to the Taiwanese
question.

PUT YOUR HEAD THROUGH THE HOLE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By  BARBARA DE WITT 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clint Eastwood wore them in westerns.
</P>
<P>
   Valerie Harper wore them as the hip window dresser Rhoda in
``The Mary Tyler Moore Show.''
</P>
<P>
   More recently they've been spotted on Sarah Jessica Parker in
that steamy new cable series, ``Sex and the City.''
</P>
<P>
   The subject is ponchos, those blankets with a hole in the center
and fringe on the edges that have been ridiculed for more than 20
years. Yep, right up there with the other p-word (polyester) and
leisure suits.
</P>
<P>
   Like other staples of the hippie-chick and handcrafted-fashion
era, the poncho has been resurrected. Once again that
one-size-fits-all item has style status, especially with those
new-again jeans sporting fabric trim and fringe around the ankles.
</P>
<P>
   But ponchos didn't always have such respectability. They got
their start as a utilitarian garment, mostly used as rain gear for
cowboys and soldiers, although they did inspire a type of women's
cloak in the late 1800s.
</P>
<P>
   Ponchos as we know them today were the creation of Bonnie
Cashin, an Oakland designer who was famous for clean, uncomplicated
designs. Back in the late '60s she made oversize plaid ponchos with
hoods in luxurious fabrics such as mohair and wool and teamed them
with plaid fringed skirts. Soon everybody was designing their own
version at all price levels and in all types of fabrics, including
corduroy.
</P>
<P>
   Now designers are doing it again. Max Azria of BCBG has short
red ones woven so loosely you can stick a fist through the
stitches, and J. Crew has designed them long and heavy enough to be
used as coats for a California winter.
</P>
<P>
   Others, such as Morgan De Toi, have made them light and airy in
mohair, while traditionalists such as Harve Benard have favored a
long-and-lean elegance. But if you're going to do the retro scene
with attitude, don't fool around with hybrids.

   Go for the one that screams '70s, from its stripes or granny
squares to its pompons at the neckline. Consider a hood (but don't
wear it on your head), and look for fringe made of yarn, instead of
the satiny lamp shade fringe.

 &HT;    Dump Rocker in a New York minute
 &HT;    By Mark Bradley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Don't send him to sensitivity training. Don't enroll
him in anger-management class. Don't fine him. Don't even suspend
him.
</P>
<P>
   Get rid of him.
</P>
<P>
   John Rocker should have no place on the Atlanta Braves. He has
dishonored the organization. He has offended everyone with a
functioning mind. He has stamped himself as a buffoon.
</P>
<P>
   Get rid of him.
</P>
<P>
   This shouldn't be a hard call. From a business perspective, can
the global conglomerate Time Warner stand to have one of its most
visible employees spewing bile _ that's bile as opposed to phlegm,
which is what Rocker disgorged at the now-infamous Georgia 400
tollbooth _ toward all points of the globe? This from Rocker:
``Asians and Koreans and Vietnamese and Indians and Russians and
Spanish people. ... How the hell did they get in this country?''
</P>
<P>
   Get rid of him.
</P>
<P>
   From a baseball perspective, Rocker has become clubhouse poison.
According to Sports Illustrated, he called a black teammate ``a fat
monkey.'' He ripped Ozzie Guillen for not making a play behind him.
He essentially called his manager a liar. Harmony in the workplace
is a key reason why the Braves win their division without fail. So
long as he remains here, Rocker will stand as an irrevocable
breach.
</P>
<P>
   Get rid of him.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves made a trade Wednesday, a big one, a good one. Nobody
much noticed. Everything was Rocker, Rocker, Rocker. Rudy Giuliani,
mayor of New York, demanded an apology. John Schuerholz, the
Braves' GM, was forced to conduct the most awkward news conference
in the history of telecommunications, addressing the trade first
and Rocker second, which was akin to a TV anchor saying, ``And in
other news today, Neil Armstrong set foot on the moon.''
</P>
<P>
   Get rid of him.
</P>
<P>
   Athletes are notoriously clannish. Ordinarily, they rally around
one another, extending the benefit of the doubt past the point of
common sense. They ``reserve judgment.'' They reach for the
``maybe-he-was-taken-out-of-context'' hook. That didn't happen
Wednesday. Brian Jordan and Leo Mazzone spoke at length on radio on
``790 The Zone,'' and neither offered even a tepid defense of
Rocker. Which says it all.
</P>
<P>
   Get rid of him.
</P>
<P>
   Back to the trade. The Braves acquired Quilvio Veras and Reggie
Sanders. Veras is from the Dominican Republic. Sanders is
African-American. Imagine the scene in spring training: ``Welcome
to the team, guys, and shake hands with John Rocker, our closer.
Here we like to think of ourselves as one big happy family.''
Imagine the day pitchers and catchers report, when Rocker greets
Javy Lopez, who is from Puerto Rico, or Eddie Perez, who is from
Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   Get rid of him.
</P>
<P>
   Through his agent, Rocker released a statement saying, ``I am
contrite,'' but noting that, hey, people make mistakes. The SI
story wasn't a mistake but a revelation, a deeper glimpse into a
troubled heart. It was only a matter of time before Rocker,
hurtling through life at 110 mph with the volume cranked up to 11,
slammed into something. The Braves needn't feel any obligation to
be there when he does it again. They can find another closer, and
if they can't _ well, better to lose with dignity than to win with
a lout.
</P>
<P>
   Get rid of him.

DEATH OF INJURED WORKER PUTS NEW PRESSURE ON JAPAN'S ATOMIC ENERGY
PROGRAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The death late Tuesday of a worker exposed to radiation
in Japan's worst nuclear accident brought renewed calls Wednesday
for curbs on the country's atomic energy program.
</P>
<P>
   The worker, Hisashi Ouchi, 35, was hurt on Sept. 30 in an
accident at a nuclear fuel plant near Tokyo that also critically
injured two other workers. Scores of nearby residents were exposed
to radiation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a victim of a myth perpetrated by the national
government and the nuclear power industry that nuclear energy is
safe,'' said Tatsuya Murakami, the mayor of Tokaimura, where the
accident took place. ``We must speak frankly to the government and
to the industry if we are to coexist with nuclear energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan's nuclear power industry has been on the defensive since
the accident, opening a rare chapter in this country's history
where citizens have effectively brought pressure to bear on the
tacit coalition between government and business in a major
industry.
</P>
<P>
   In a front-page commentary Wednesday, the Asahi Shimbun, a
leading newspaper, noted that the 1979 accident at Three Mile
Island had led to the end of the expansion of nuclear power in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's government may have been heedless about the dangers of
nuclear energy, the newspaper wrote. But after the accident in
Tokaimura, it said, the people ``are starting to feel genuine
horror and concern about nuclear power generation, perhaps for the
first time in their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi offered his condolences to Ouchi's
family, and said ``the government has been working so that such an
accident will never be repeated.''
</P>
<P>
   Far more than most people, many Japanese have associated all
things nuclear with death and destruction, a legacy of the atomic
bombings of this country by the United States in 1945. The nuclear
power industry, which supplies over 30 percent of the country's
electricity, was able to thrive here only after unstinting efforts
to cultivate an image of extraordinary safety.
</P>
<P>
   For many here, the Tokaimura accident, which resulted from
procedural lapses not only shattered the safety myth, but also,
given the gruesome conditions of Ouchi's death, will recall
memories of the bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Recent pressure by civic groups and a strong shift in public
opinion against nuclear power have already forced several of the
largest power plants to cancel or postpone plans to upgrade their
operations. A particular target of local opposition has been the
planned use of a hybrid fuel containing both uranium and plutonium
by so-called light-water plants that were originally designed to
burn uranium only.
</P>
<P>
   Local skepticism about the safety of such plans has been
heightened by the news that a British company that was Japan's
principal supplier for the new fuels falsified safety reports.
</P>
<P>
   The Tokaimura fuel reprocessing plant, where Ouchi worked, was a
cornerstone of Japan's ambitious program for plutonium use, which
stems from a dream for national energy independence in a country
that has no oil reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Under this plan, Japan has sought to recover plutonium from the
spent fuel rods of its many light-water reactors. Once purified,
the plutonium _ a raw ingredient for nuclear weapons _ is mixed
with uranium and then made into pellets for burning.
</P>
<P>
   Nuclear energy experts have long warned that the mixed fuel
increases the risk of rupture inside the cores of power plants.
Moreover, they say, in case of a catastrophic accident, plutonium
and its byproducts are far more lethal than uranium.
</P>
<P>
   What few had foreseen, though, was the kind of blunder that
occurred at Tokaimura, where poorly trained workers were following
crude shortcuts, mixing nuclear fuels by hand with steel buckets.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, these shortcuts, some of which were included in an
illegal manual distributed by the plant's management, led to a
miscalculation in which more than seven times the normal amount of
fuel was poured into a container. A result was a nuclear chain
reaction that took nearly a day to bring to a halt, and the
critical injury of the three workers directly involved.
</P>
<P>
   In the space of a few minutes, Ouchi, the worst-hit worker, was
exposed to 400 times the maximum amount of radiation a nuclear
plant worker is allowed to received in an entire year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Perhaps in part because of dread of the backlash against nuclear
power, the government went to extraordinary lengths to save Ouchi's
life.
</P>
<P>
   Although he had not regained consciousness since mid-October,
doctors at the University of Tokyo Hospital had been ordered to
spare no means to save him. According to the doctors involved in
his care, 10 liters of blood were transfused into his body daily in
recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In late November, Ouchi had to be resuscitated after his heart
failed. Since then, doctors said, his skin, which suffered severe
peeling after the accident and never healed, had been oozing more
and more bodily fluids.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said that despite the administration of huge amounts of
pain killing drugs, even in his unconscious state the patient
winced and showed other signs of agony when receiving treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned a lot from 81 days of unprecedented treatment,''
said Kazuhiko Maekawa, the doctor who led the team treating Ouchi.
``But we were also made aware of the limits of today's medical
science.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chemical analysis of dirty dishes and drinking cups found 42
years ago in a tomb in Turkey have given archaeologists revealing
clues to what ancients considered a feast fit for a king, perhaps
the King Midas of the legendary golden touch.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone dined on barbecued lamb or goat in a spicy stew with
lentils. They washed this down with a potent mixed drink of grape
wine, barley beer and mead. Judging by the size of three huge
bronze cauldrons _ the reservoirs of drink _ a good and not very
sober time was had by all.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion was a royal funeral 2,700 years ago at Gordion,
capital of the powerful Phrygian kingdom, where Midas ruled around
700 B.C. After eating and drinking, the mourners lowered the log
coffin of their king into the tomb, along with wooden dining tables
and hundreds of bronze serving vessels, drinking cups and pottery
jars. Out of either tipsy slovenliness or some custom, they did not
bother to wash the dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists at the University of Pennsylvania, using advanced
techniques of chemical analysis, have now made the most of the
dregs and leftovers. They describe the menu of the royal funerary
feast in a report being published in Thursday's issue of the
journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our findings have an important bearing on the cultural
antecedents of Midas' Phrygian kingdom and on the wider application
of molecular archaeological techniques to other ancient foods and
beverages,'' Dr. Patrick E. McGovern and colleagues wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The chemical examination of congealed clumps of leftovers in
pottery jars and other vessels produced traces of fatty acids,
cholesterol and triglycerides, identifying sheep or goat as the
entree. Carbon remains suggested that the meat had been barbecued.
</P>
<P>
   Other compounds showed that legume seeds, probably lentils, had
been added to the stew, along with olive oil, honey and wine. For
spice, the Phrygian chefs tossed in a dash of Mediterranean herbs,
either anise or fennel.
</P>
<P>
   Scrapings from the bronze cauldrons and the drinking cups
revealed the presence of tartaric acid, calcium oxalate and
beeswax, evidence of a wine-beer-mead punch known to the Greeks as
kykeon. And there seemed to be plenty to go around.
</P>
<P>
   Because about 100 drinking cups were found in the tomb and each
of the three cauldrons had a 33-gallon capacity, McGovern said in
an interview, each of the feasting mourners could have consumed a
gallon of joy.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists and other scholars at the University of Pennsylvania
Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology said the new findings
provided, in the words of one, ``dramatic, direct evidence of
ancient Mediterranean cuisine and custom.''
</P>
<P>
   Previous evidence of funerary feasts in antiquity came from a
few texts. The Hittites, whose empire flourished before the eighth
century B.C. in what is now southern Turkey and northern Syria,
left cuneiform tablets describing food being offered to mourners at
royal burials. In Homer's Iliad, the Trojans feasted and drank a
mixed fermented beverage at the burial of Hector.
</P>
<P>
   Now scholars can almost smell and taste the banquets they once
could only read about. Indeed, the Pennsylvania museum has
announced that it is planning to re-create a King Midas feast next
fall.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Because the practice of mixing fermented drinks was common in
the Greek world of the time, archaeologists say, finding the
residues of a similar drink at the Gordion tomb is compelling new
evidence that the Phrygians arrived in that region from Europe,
probably northern Greece or Bulgaria. The site of Gordion is in
what is now central Turkey, near Ankara.
</P>
<P>
   The tomb supposedly holding Midas was discovered in 1957 by a
University of Pennsylvania team of archaeologists led by Dr. Rodney
S. Young. Within a mound more than 150 feet high and 1,000 feet
wide, the archaeologists found the well-preserved wooden tomb and a
log coffin containing the skeleton of a king, age 60 to 65.
</P>
<P>
   Around the coffin stood elaborately inlaid wooden furniture,
some of the earliest and best-preserved furniture in the world. The
three bronze cauldrons were resting on iron tripods. Inside the
cauldrons were many of the smaller pottery vessels and the drinking
cups.
</P>
<P>
   The rancid smell of spoiled meat overwhelmed the archaeologists
when they opened the tomb. At first, they suspected that the
furnishings and the residues of food and drink might have been
placed there solely for the king's use in the hereafter.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Elizabeth Simpson, who has spent years studying the tomb
furnishings, said she was reminded more of the remains of a grand
feast in the manner of those associated with burials throughout the
ancient world. The feast, she said, was presumably held outdoors
near the tomb, there being no room inside for the many mourners.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the discovery, Dr. Simpson, a research associate at
the university museum and also at the Bard Graduate Center for
Studies of Decorative Arts in New York City, became the first to
propose the chemical study of the feast's leftovers. The results
then were inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have the kind of analytical instruments then that we
have now,'' McGovern said. ``We've really come a long way in 40
years. Most archaeology focuses on the examination of inorganic
materials. But it's the organic that can tell us what people ate
and drank, among other important things.''
</P>
<P>
   The samples extracted from the jars and bowls were analyzed by
such techniques as infrared spectrometry, high-performance liquid
chromatography-mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass
spectrometry. Collaborating with McGovern's group in the testing
were scientists from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, SmithKline
Beecham Pharmaceuticals, Vassar College and Scientific Instrument
Services. The research was supported by a grant from the J.M.
Kaplan Fund, a frequent underwriter of archaeological innovation.
</P>
<P>
   For McGovern, an archaeochemist, the Midas menu was the piece de
resistance to his years of research on the food and drink of
antiquity. He had previously examined residues of clay pots to
determine the earliest known wine, from 5400 B.C., and the earliest
known barley beer, from 3400 B.C. Both were found at ruins in the
Zagros Mountains of Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Gordion tomb has never been positively identified
as that of King Midas, McGovern's group said in the journal report,
the association ``is strongly supported by the monumental size of
the earthen mound built over the tomb, the richness of the burial
goods and the contemporaneous Assyrian inscriptions.''
</P>
<P>
   If the mourners were in fact feasting to the memory of the Midas
who later became a figure of mythology, the irony is inescapable.
He was a real king of the Phrygians (one of several of their kings
of that name) but is famously remembered through a legend of
avarice. It was said of Midas that everything he touched, even his
food and drink, turned to gold. And so, rich as he was, he nearly
starved to death.

MOZAMBIQUE SAYS PRESIDENT IS RE-ELECTED; RIVALS PROTEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (js)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ President Joaquim Chissano of
Mozambique was declared the victor Wednesday, after three days of
voting this month, touching off cries of protest from opposition
leaders who said the balloting was rigged.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the opposition, the Mozambique Resistance Movement,
known as Renamo, said their candidates had won the presidency and
control of Parliament, though results released by the National
Electoral Commission indicated otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   The Renamo officials said that they would petition the
Constitutional Court for a recount and that their newly elected
legislators would boycott Parliament until their concerns had been
addressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not accepting these results,'' a spokesman for Renamo,
Jafar Gulamo Jafar, said in a telephone interview. ``Our
information, our data, shows another picture. A manual recount
would give us some guarantees.''
</P>
<P>
   The fraud allegations marred an election that many people had
hoped would solidify a fledgling democracy. The balloting, on Dec.
3, 4 and 5, was the second free election since a 16-year civil war
ended in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing civil disturbances from angry Renamo supporters, the
government put the national police on alert for the third day in a
row, and Chissano and his opponent in the election, Afonso
Dhlakama, called for calm.
</P>
<P>
   The electoral commission reported that Chissano had won 52
percent of the vote and Dhlakama 48 percent. In Parliament, the
governing Mozambique Liberation Front, known as Frelimo, won 133
seats to 117 for Renamo, the commission reported.
</P>
<P>
   International monitors had declared the three days of voting
free and fair, although 8,000 citizens never voted because
officials could not deliver voting materials to several remote
districts made inaccessible by torrential rains.
</P>
<P>
   Western observers said the counting, which lasted more than two
weeks, had been hampered by computer glitches, mathematical errors
and other technical problems, leading to many contested votes.
</P>
<P>
   Renamo officials contend that fraud occurred when election
officials entered results into a computer and that their officials
were denied adequate access to monitor that process. Election
officials and Frelimo officials have denied the accusations.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Carter Center in Atlanta, which has a small team of monitors
in Mozambique, did not comment Wednesday on the elections. But in a
statement on Tuesday, officials said they had observed and assessed
the counting in virtually every province, even though the center
also said its monitors' access was inconsistent. The officials
commended the commitment and cooperation between the two parties in
the election.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Wednesday night, President Thabo Mbeki of South
Africa, who has been mentioned as a possible mediator in the
dispute, urged the parties ``to accept the election's outcome,
which has been declared free and fair by the Mozambican National
Electoral Commission and the International Observer Mission.''

BHUTAN, NEPAL AND U.N. GRAPPLE WITH LITTLE-NOTICED REFUGEE CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Bhutan, a Himalayan kingdom caught in a
decade-long refugee crisis that has opened the little-known country
to charges of ``ethnic cleansing,'' has released all prisoners that
human rights groups regarded as political detainees, according to
Bhutan's representative at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The case shows the limits of what the U.N. high commissioner for
refugees can do, even though tens of thousands of people say they
have been made refugees by events in Bhutan. The Bhutanese say that
the number is far smaller, and that only one side of the story has
been heard, through aid organizations, diplomats and politicians in
neighboring Nepal.
</P>
<P>
   With huge refugee crises elsewhere, there has been little effort
internationally to settle the dispute, which on the surface seems
not very complicated. In part because of the standoff, Bhutan ranks
low on international surveys of democracy, at least one of which
has been used as evidence by officials in New York to bar the
purchase of a property by the Bhutan government to house its U.N.
mission.
</P>
<P>
   Bhutan's representative at the United Nations, Om Pradhan, said
Monday that the decision to free about 200 prisoners, among them
many common criminals, had been made by King Jigme Singye
Wangchuck. ``We let them all go,'' Pradhan said.
</P>
<P>
   The king celebrated 25 years on the throne this year and has
gradually introduced political reforms in what was until very
recently an absolute monarchy.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 prisoners known as anti-nationals in Bhutan were among
those released, including Tek Nath Rizal, who was convicted of
leading an uprising against the king. The only prisoners not freed
were those in jail for murder and the desecration of sacred relics,
Bhutan's only newspaper, Kuensel, reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
   For the past decade, Bhutan, whose people are mostly ethnically
Tibetan Buddhists who speak a Tibetan-based language, has been the
target of an ethnic Nepali movement along the southern border. A
sparsely populated temperate and semitropical zone there was
drawing illegal immigrants from overpopulated Nepal and the
Darjeeling hill country and the northeast of India. The newcomers
to this area of Bhutan rapidly augmented the local ethnic Nepali
population, mostly Hindus, raising fears that they would eventually
outnumber the Bhutanese Buddhists.
</P>
<P>
   When Bhutan began expelling people it said were not citizens,
ethnic Nepalis around the region responded with accusations of
``ethnic cleansing,'' and a rebellion began in southern Bhutan.
Rizal, a former adviser to the king, first tried to have a census
stopped because, he said, it was alienating the people of the
south. The government said he then turned to persuading Bhutanese
Nepalis that the census was a ruse to expel them and take their
land.
</P>
<P>
   Rizal was first detained in 1988, then pardoned by the king. In
1989 he was arrested again after moving to Nepal to organize a
movement against Bhutan, and was sentenced by a court to life
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people fled or were forced out of Bhutan in the
years of unrest that followed. More than 80,000 are in refugee
camps in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
   Bhutan says most are probably not Bhutanese citizens but poor
ethnic Nepalis from India or Nepal drawn to the camps for the
benefits and to keep alive the anti-Buddhist campaign.

don't need a long-winded sales report to tell them sales are up
this holiday season. They just asked Santa. Photo sales at the
mall's Santa station are up 23 percent over last year, a surge in
business that is echoed at shopping centers across the region. And,
in the eyes of shop owners at least, the best is yet to come:

   SWISSAIR-MOVE (Los Angeles) -- Leaders in Antelope Valley north

in its impact -- or better -- than Lockheed Martin Skunk Works
moving to Palmdale in the early 1990s. ``I'm confident, but I'm not
going to say it's a done deal,'' said Palmdale Mayor Jim Ledford.

   BRUSH-HAZARD (Los Angeles) -- The dual fires that roared through
hundreds of acres early Wednesday in Glendale and near Ojai were
dramatic reminders of the extremely hazardous conditions this
winter. After weeks of dry, hot and windy weather -- the second
consecutive La Nina winter -- officials have extended fire season,
posted numerous red-flag alerts and warned residents that brush
clearance should now be considered a life-and-death matter.
Firefighters are predeploying 16 engines in the San Fernando Valley
and hopeful that efforts to make utilities, public agencies
including Caltrans, and large property owners comply with brush
clearance rules will prevent a major conflagration. By Harrison
Sheppard (Will move on the ``n'' California and the ``n'' national

<P>
   BATTLE-FIRE (Los Angeles) -- Working against darkness and 60 mph
high winds, 500 firefighters from departments throughout Southern
California bulldozed fire breaks and undertook risky helicopter
water drops to keep the fire above Glendale away from homes until
Super Scoopers could be brought in at daylight Wednesday, bringing
the 600-acre fire under control. With its resources taxed, traffic
nightmares and hours to go before the fire is expected to be out,
Glendale City officials declared a local state of emergency. With
update on investigation into cause. By Donna Huffaker (Will move on

<P>
   ORDEAL-FIRE (Los Angeles) -- Hundreds of Glendale and La Canada
Flintridge residents spent a tension-filled night watching flames
and smoke burn closer and closer to their homes. Fire officials
said as many as 100 homes were in harm's way. Many evacuated and
returned early Wednesday relieved to find homes in tact. Also

   FLU-SURGE (Los Angeles) -- Overwhelmed by calls for runs to
emergency rooms from cold and flu victims, Los Angeles city
paramedics are seeking permission from county officials to break
protocol and be allowed to return to duty before patients are
assigned hospital beds. It is the latest problem caused by the
seasonal surge in flu cases and a sharp rise in wind-worsened
respiratory ailments. Heavy smoke from Wednesday's fire above
Glendale was expected to aggravate respiratory conditions in
residents as far away as Venice. By Rick Orlov (Will move on the

   GIFTS-RESTORED (Los Angeles) -- Droves of do-gooders have more
than replaced the 60 gifts stolen by Grinch burglars at a North
Hollywood homeless shelter. More than 50 people -- most anonymous
-- donated at least 150 toys Wednesday. Some people also rolled up
their sleeves to help sort the toys, the executive director said.
Others are making cash donations and in one case, a Chatsworth man
who is walking around the world has volunteered to knock on doors
asking for donations while walking about 30 miles from Chatsworth

   AUDIT-LAUSD (Los Angeles) -- A state audit released Wednesday

site-selection process fails to provide information to decision
makers and doesn't effectively engage the community. By Terri Hardy

PRESIDENT ISSUES WARNING ON TERRORISM 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also TERROR-SEATTLE, moving in `a' category.) 
(rk) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton warned Americans Wednesday to be
watchful about terrorism during the coming holidays, as other
senior administration officials also urged caution but said there
was no specific information that any extremist group had planned an
attack in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking extraordinary efforts in the government to act
based on the incident out in the Pacific Northwest,'' Clinton said,
referring to the arrest last week of Ahmed Ressam, an Algerian who
was arraigned Wednesday in Seattle. Ressam is accused of trying to
enter Washington state from Canada in a car carrying explosive
chemicals and timing devices.
</P>
<P>
   The president's remarks culminated several days in which
government agencies have issued an unusual number of alerts,
warnings and security advisories that, taken together, reflect a
level of anxiety over potential terrorist acts that has peaked
higher than at any time in recent history.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials said that warnings were based in part
on intelligence assessments that the arrest of Ressam might not be
an isolated event, but indicative of a wider effort by terrorists
to enter the United States to attack Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In part, those fears stem from past threats against Americans by
Osama Bin Laden, who on Aug. 7, 1998 was indicted in the bombings
of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 220 people. He
is believed to be in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   But while the officials said that recent threats are genuine, as
in the case of the arrests in Jordan of suspects believed to be
connected to Bin Laden's network, they acknowledged that the
warnings were also an effort to avoid possible criticism. State
Department officials were stung by the accusations of some
lawmakers who said the agency's security personnel were inattentive
to advance warnings of the East Africa bombings.
</P>
<P>
   But such warnings can sometimes be extremely difficult to
interpret, the officials said. Domestic and overseas
counterterrorism agencies do not publicize it, but they receive a
number of threats each week against a variety of government and
private targets. Very few are legitimate, but in light of past
terrorist acts, all of them are examined.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, the officials said, the high state of alert
recently announced by government agencies is somewhat illusory.
Many agencies already stepped up security arrangements in
anticipation of possible computer problems in connection with the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Eric H. Holder Jr., the deputy attorney general,
asked Americans to be vigilant for anything or anyone that looked
suspicious, particularly at the sites of large holiday or
millennium events that might attract large crowds.
</P>
<P>
   At a Justice Department news conference, Holder said, ``We're
doing everything in our power to prevent any attacks from occurring
and to bring to justice those people responsible for planning any
such attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   The warning from the Justice Department came in the wake of a
State Department alert issued last Wednesday evening when the
agency said _ for the second time in 11 days _ that the government
believed that terrorists might be planning attacks against private
citizens and officials around the New Year. The warning focused on
Jordan where authorities recently arrested 13 suspected terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department warning followed an alert issued earlier in
the day by the Federal Aviation Administration that said travelers
at American airports should expect tightened security precautions,
including stricter enforcement of parking regulations.
</P>
<P>
   As the enhanced security precautions took hold, the State
Department's deputy spokesman, James Foley, said that an American
had been detained by U.S. Customs officials in the Bahamas as he
was about to board a flight to Miami en route to Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   Foley said that the suspect, who was not identified, was found
to be carrying wires, magnet coils, a putty-like substance,
batteries and circuit boards. After trying to flee an immigration
pre-clearance area, he was arrested. He told authorities that he
was an inventor, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Foley said the arrest interrupted routine operations at the U.S.
Embassy in the Bahamas while security personnel searched the
premises, but nothing suspicious was found. Later, the suspect was
transferred to Nassau for questioning by federal authorities
</P>
<P>
   But Foley followed Clinton's lead in trying to temper the
warnings with a calming tone. ``Panic is not in our vocabulary,''
Foley said, calling the warnings ``a cautionary light, not a red
light.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in his remarks Wednesday as he visited a soup kitchen
in Washington, said: ``For the citizens, I would say they ought to
go about their holidays and enjoy themselves and make the most of
it. But I would ask them to just be aware of their circumstances
and, if they see anything suspicious, to report it immediately, and
meanwhile to know that we are doing everything we possibly can.''

CLEVER `GALAXY' BOLDLY GOES FOR FUN
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: EMBARGOED until Friday, Dec. 24. Fact box below) 
Our rating: 3 stars 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While there hasn't been an official ``Star Trek'' movie this
year, fans of the show haven't been lacking for big-screen
entertainment. First came ``Trekkies,'' an engaging documentary
about die-hard followers of the series, which was followed in short
order by ``Free Enterprise,'' in which ``Trek'' fans evolve into
``Swingers''-style dudes who bond with a bumbling Bill Shatner.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes ``Galaxy Quest,'' an amusing and breezy comedy about
what happens when a group of sci-fi series has-beens gets confused
for real-deal action heroes by an alien race who watched their show
on some kind of intergalactic satellite dish. The naive
extraterrestrials believe that the actors really are space studs
(they also lament the misfortune of ``those poor people'' on
``Gilligan's Island'') and enlist them to battle their evil
crustaceanlike adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a playful send-up of science-fiction conventions
(both the conferences and the customs) that has enough laughs to
please audiences looking for something a little light among all the
year-end cinematic gloom.
</P>
<P>
   While the movie isn't completely geared toward ``Star Trek'' and
fantasy fans, the screenplay (written by David Howard and Peter
Gordon) contains plenty of sweet-natured humor that works on a
deeper level if you're familiar with series lore. Of course,
``Galaxy Quest'' never strives for profundity; in fact, on the few
occasions when director Dean Parisot (``Home Fries'') decides to go
for the heartstrings, the movie veers into a maudlin sentimentality
not at all suited to its one-joke premise.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, ``Galaxy Quest'' is mostly content to be clever,
and Parisot is aided quite ably by a talented cast. Tim Allen plays
the egotistical actor Jason Nesmith, the big-haired hambone who
headed the ``Galaxy Quest'' cast. His compatriots include the buxom
blonde, Gwen DeMarco (Sigourney Weaver), who was the show's token
babe, and Alexander Dane (Alan Rickman), a Shakespearean actor
forever typecast by his alien makeup.
</P>
<P>
   Since the show was canceled in 1982, Nesmith and his castmates
have worked the convention and grand-opening circuit, signing
autographs and eeking out a living. That changes when the
Thermians, whom Nesmith mistakes as overzealous fans, tab the
actors for real-life space work, beaming them up to a facsimile of
the ``Galaxy Quest'' ship.
</P>
<P>
   The film has knowing fun with a number of ``Trek'' cliches and
myths: the ways extras tended to be killed in an episode's first
five minutes, the bargain-basement sets and props, the petty
bickering among the actors and the love-hate relationship that
exists between fans and cast members. Everyone seems to be having
great fun here, particularly Weaver, who gets a rare chance to
display her comic chops, and the ascerbic Rickman, who nails every
note as the bitter thespian who has been straight jacketed by his
short stint as a Spock-like alien. Tony Shalhoub, Sam Rockwell and
Daryl Mitchell each make the most of their moments in finely drawn
supporting roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Galaxy Quest,'' like ``Star Trek'' itself, is hardly great
art, but it's certainly good fun. And in a season dominated by some
pretty serious fare, the movie has the gumption to boldly go to a
mostly unexplored region _ the audience's funny bone _ coming up a
winner in the process. &QL;

THE END OF A HOLLYWOOD ERA OF HIGH STYLE AND HIGH FAT  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 26) 
</HEADLINE>

   OFF THE MENU: THE LAST DAYS OF CHASEN'S &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1998; directed by Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini. New
Video. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   90 minutes. $24.95. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Frank Sinatra and Mia Farrow celebrated their first (and last)
anniversary there. When she was making ``Cleopatra,'' Elizabeth
Taylor had the chili flown to Rome. One evening Shirley Temple had
a drink invented especially for her. And on another occasion, as
Fay Wray tells the story, Orson Welles picked up a container of
flaming sterno and threw it at John Houseman.
</P>
<P>
   Frozen in time, swimming in cholesterol, Chasen's restaurant was
the very essence of Hollywood for six decades. When it closed in
1995, the so-called golden age went with it, or so it was said.
``This town knows it,'' claims a Chasen's habitue in Ms. Berman and
Pulcini's documentary about the restaurant and the celebrities who
crowded the place as if they were straight from the set of ``Sunset
Boulevard.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, the film is about the care and feeding of celebrity
by chefs, waiters, bartenders and maitre d's who, by virtue of
their position, served as links between the famous and the rest of
us. And serve they did, with pride and slavish devotion.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Hitchcock, Clark Gable, James Stewart, Barbara Stanwyck,
Kirk Douglas, Ava Gardner, Gary Cooper and their ilk patronized the
place nightly, as did a raft of producers, directors and
politicians and a menagerie of movers and shakers and their
hangers-on.
</P>
<P>
   In all those years, only Hitchcock and Lew Wasserman, head of
Universal, were granted regular tables. On any given night, it was
not uncommon to find J. Edgar Hoover at one table and the gangster
Mickey Cohen at another. ``When the Watergate crowd was in town,
what you saw on TV was in here that night,'' one observer comments.
</P>
<P>
   In the film, the hobo steak being cooked tableside is poked
across a lake of melted butter. ``No calories in that stuff,
right?'' says the producer David Brown, who points out that one of
Chasen's problems was that today there are no more eaters.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant was always a masculine place. A Mexican bartender
named Pepe Ruiz mixes an absolute killer of a drink for Ed McMahon,
Johnny Carson's ex-sidekick, who calls him the ``most important
Hispanic in Southern California.'' The famous could patronize at
will at Chasen's. The staff stays adoring.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was over. ``It's closing because we don't come here
anymore,'' says the television host Tom Snyder. The crowd was
gravitating to hipper, trendier places. In the last days, though,
they all piled into Chasen's: Sharon Stone, Quentin Tarantino, Jay
Leno, Madonna.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you die, everybody comes to the funeral,'' Ruiz says.
Sylvester Stallone is turned away with six people. The management
turns to ``loss prevention.''
</P>
<P>
   A woman friend of Daryl F. Gates, former police chief of Los
Angeles, tries to take a lamp. Across town, someone notes, a new
Chasen's has opened with lighter cuisine.

<TEXT>
<P>
   On New Year's Eve, many of the 1,000-some couples attending the
Memphis Junior League's charity ball at the Peabody Hotel will take
their children along. So the parents can be free to cavort, they
have corralled 40 baby sitters from the Annie's Nannies agency.
Each sitter will be paid $330 for the 11-hour affair, triple the
agency's usual rate.
</P>
<P>
   So it will be in most big cities and their affluent suburbs this
New Year's Eve. Baby sitters, whether teen-age amateurs or
professional adults like those from Annie's Nannies, stand to earn
up to $100 an hour for one night's work, or more than many a
partygoer's champagne.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents around here are really strapped,'' said 15-year-old
Emily Redburn of affluent Montclair, N.J. She said a friend at a
deli told her of a couple looking for a sitter for the night.
``Really cool,'' Emily said. ``It's two kids, ages 11 and 9.
They're going to call me.''
</P>
<P>
   In spite of reports of a more tranquil millennium-crossing than
first forecast, with many hotels and restaurants hoping for guests
and chopping prices, placement services say they are running short
of the nation's sitters _ baby sitters, pet sitters and building
sitters, or security guards _ who free others to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   By most accounts, demand for sitters and guards this New Year's
Eve far exceeds that of previous years. More people plan to go out,
and more businesses want protection against vandalism and system
and power failures if computers go awry. Meanwhile, the supply of
sitters is lower than usual, with more taking the night off
themselves. Many an agency's answering machine says its sitters are
booked through New Year's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting more requests than I've ever had,'' said Nate
Wood, a senior vice president at Blackhawk Inc. in Suitland, Md.,
near Washington, which places security guards. Blackhawk has
exhausted its reserve supply of guards filling the swollen demand
of regular clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants security,'' Wood said, ``for cabarets, for
special events. All of our banks want extra coverage. All of our
retail clients. We've been driven all the way to the end of our
means.''
</P>
<P>
   To feed and tend pets, Sit-a-Pet in Arlington, Va., normally
charges $17 for a half-hour visit with one pet once a day and $2
for each additional dog or cat. But to induce more of her 70
sitters to stay on the job, the agency's owner, Debbie Hollander,
said, ``We have a millennium policy. For anyone using us the 31st
or the 1st, it's an additional $25 a day.''
</P>
<P>
   But in terms of the pay, the cream of this crop is
entrepreneurial teen-agers and adult women who care for children.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen-year-old Ingrid Aguero of Miami and her cousin, Amy
Rejaian, 14, will watch children in Ingrid's home. They have lined
up three children so far, ages 8 months to 7 years to spend the
night. For the three, they will earn $135, and they are advertising
on the Internet for more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it would be too much to charge at first,'' Ingrid
said. ``But, really, almost everyone is going out, and they would
pay anything for a sitter on that night.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the New York suburb of Ridgewood, N.J., 13-year-old Alex
Ortiz, whose father will be at work on New Year's Eve and whose
mother will be at home, plans to have two or three children ages 3
to 6 come to his home around 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll eat dinner here,'' said Alex, who has honed his
sitting skills watching two younger sisters. ``And I'll entertain
them. They'll spend the night, and their parents will pick them up
around 10 or 11 in the morning.'' Alex plans to ask $150 per child
and has already signed one up.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the demand for sitters is ``high, high, high,''
said Heidi Davalos of the Baby Sitters Guild placement service. She
is charging a minimum of $250 for five hours for up to five
children. The $250 is deposited upon signing a contract and is
nonrefundable, a common arrangement for New Year's Eve. ``We're
fully booked,'' Ms. Davalos said, with 100 sitters assigned.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Tokayer, owner of Family Helpers in the town of Dobbs
Ferry, north of New York City, said she had not had many requests
for sitters, but in defiance of the law of economics that says low
demand means low prices, ``I keep hearing of people who will be
making hundreds and hundreds of dollars,'' Ms. Tokayer said. Rather
than quote a price, she refers callers directly to sitters to
negotiate one.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, Priscilla Garnache, owner of Boston's Best Baby
Sitters-Nannies, said, ``We're obviously very booked. We have
placed about 20 for New Year's Eve. If I had 200, I'm sure I could
place 200.'' She is charging a family with three children $225 for
five hours.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as Las Vegas has discovered, the sky is not the limit.
Anticipating a high demand from high rollers at the casino hotels
there, the Nannies and Grannies agency set a charge of $500 to
watch one or two children in the hotels' bedrooms for four hours,
or more than 10 times the usual fee of $45. But parents have been
balking, and as in other big cities, hotel bookings have been fewer
than expected. ``So we have readjusted that down to $350,'' H.D.
Hale, the agency's general manager, said.
</P>
<P>
   In all these cities, security guards also are in high demand.
Agencies say that calls for guards have soared, less in response to
a need for crowd control and crime deterrence than to worries that
buildings' computer-controlled locks, elevators and other systems
will go berserk when the clock strikes midnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mostly, people are concerned about access control,'' said
Michael Julian, New York City regional vice president for
Spectaguard. Banks, for example, link their vaults and doors to
clocks that could misread the debut of the millennium and open
after midnight, and apartment buildings could lock out returning
revelers. ``What we're talking about is locks more than anything
else,'' Julian said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Spectaguard will have 600 guards on the job on New Year's Eve in
New York, 200 more than on a typical weekend night.
</P>
<P>
   The guards, most of whom normally earn less than $10 an hour,
can expect big rewards for giving up their night on the town. ``You
have to give them some inducement to work,'' said Richard Hamilton,
president of Watson Security Agency of DC, who said he had more
than doubled his guards' pay, to $25 and $30 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Calvery, manager of the Burns International office in
Vienna, Va., said that for a lack of extra personnel, he had turned
down a customer who offered $80 an hour. In Chicago, Mike
Ragnanese, district manager for Pinkerton's there, declined to
disclose how much he charges. But he said that some agencies would
charge as much as $100 an hour for one guard.

to off-duty guards who stay home. Then, if the guards are called
in, they will receive holiday pay and an additional bonus. &QL;

VERY `TALENTED' INDEED
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: EMBARGOED until Friday, Dec. 24. Fact box below) 
Our rating: 3 1/2 stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' is as luxurious a psycho-thriller as
anyone could wish for. Sumptuous, sensual, stately and twisted,
it's a class act all the way _ especially in its insistence on
viewing abundant beauty with an uneasy eye.
</P>
<P>
   Filmed in just about every corner of Italy you'd ever want to
see, the movie is a sunny noir exercise in the tradition of
Hitchcock's continental romps _ but very, very different from the
master's work in its particular sense of dread.
</P>
<P>
   Screenwriter-director Anthony Minghella, who so successfully
cracked the all-but-unfilmable ``English Patient'' last time out,
has faithfully reproduced the peculiar, clammy atmosphere of
Patricia Highsmith's source novel while deepening its characters
and adding new ones, enriching their relationships, slightly but
significantly altering the time frame and investing the whole
narrative with subtle but lacerating social observations.
</P>
<P>
   Highsmith also provided the material for one of Hitchcock's
masterpieces, ``Strangers on a Train.'' This movie takes that
story's theme of criminal identity-swapping distressingly further.
The not-so-subliminal subtext here is that affection withheld can
be substituted, by those bold and desperate enough to take the
steps, by stealing the love object's very self.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Ripley, played more as a borderline personality than as the
book's calculating sociopath by a quicksilver Matt Damon, seems
such a decent, likable young man that he earns the trust of a
wealthy New York shipbuilder (James Rebhorn) on first sight.
Mistaking Ripley for a Princeton grad _ he was wearing a borrowed
school blazer while playing piano at a tony cocktail party _ Mr.
Greenleaf offers to pay the young man's way to Italy if he'll help
talk the industrialist's errant, ex-Princetonian son into returning
home and making something of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Ripley, who lives in a coldwater basement and works as a men's
room attendant at Carnegie Hall, jumps at the offer. It's the late
1950s, Italy is overrun with rich, high-living American jazz
hounds, and the second he sets foot on the sun-kissed peninsula, it
is evident that Ripley will not be in any hurry to accomplish his
mission. In fact, once he insinuates himself into the orbit of
charming hedonist Dickie Greenleaf (British actor Jude Law, perfect
as a gracious but utterly self-centered American aristocrat) and
Dickie's pleasant, well-bred girlfriend (who else but Gwyneth
Paltrow?), Ripley becomes so intoxicated with the sweet life that
it's not much of a surprise, later on, when he demonstrates the
capacity to kill in order to keep living it. Ripley also becomes
inordinately intoxicated with fickle benefactor Dickie, which isn't
hard but, we just know, can only lead to trouble.
</P>
<P>
   In one of recent cinema's more potent conspiracies between
director and actor, Minghella and Damon create a superficially
admirable if slightly pathetic chap whose unformed sexuality,
poignant neediness and uncanny ability to deceive his way through
any predicament _ except the ones that mean the most to him
emotionally _ turns viewers into non-resisting accomplices. Ripley
proves ruthless and conscienceless _ but Damon, rather
miraculously, never lets us think for a minute that he doesn't have
a soul. Between that, the forbidden yearnings (it is still the
1950s, after all) and the impressive mimickry the role requires,
Damon makes us complicit in acts and urges we would certainly never
really approve of. It's the trickiest, and one of the finest,
performances of the year.
</P>
<P>
   And he sings a decent ``My Funny Valentine'' to boot.
</P>
<P>
   Cate Blanchett, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Jack Davenport round
out the superb cast. John Seale's luscious, sparkling
cinematography captures all the natural and historic beauty of
Italy _ watching it is like taking the Grand Tour with a deranged
guide. The soundtrack boasts expertly chosen bop classics that
composer Gabriel Yared somehow manages to complement with a lush
classical score.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Ripley's'' overriding virtue, perhaps, is its unerring
intelligence. With sure takes on the entitled thoughtlessness and
capricious cruelty of the rich, the special kind of poison only a
disappointed father can distill and how the sexual politics of the
time rendered the most obvious of motives unthinkable (and
dismissed truth when a woman spoke it), ``Ripley'' is perceptive in
a manner more thrillers should be.
</P>
<P>
   And even though it takes its good time getting to the
suspenseful stuff _ which can fairly be viewed as either a strength
or the film's one notable flaw _ once the traps start springing,
the tension level is delicioso.

CANADA MOVES TO TIGHTEN SECURITY ALONG BORDER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ A Montreal woman arrested at a remote border crossing
in Vermont Sunday had made at least one earlier trip to New England
in recent days, raising fears that she may have already delivered
explosives or terrorist operatives, sources in the United States
and Canada said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Canada, meanwhile, moved to tighten security amid reports of
terrorist groups operating within its borders. The move came after
an unusual joint announcement by US Attorney General Janet Reno and
Canadian Solicitor General Lawrence MacAulay that the ``two
countries are working together to to deal with any potential threat
to security of citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators increasingly believe Montreal may be the key point
of connection in a radical Islamic terrorist conspiracy targeting
the United States. All of the three individuals arrested in Vermont
and Washington state have close ties to an ``Algerian underground''
in Canada's second-largest city.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent arrests came when Lucia Garofalo _ a 35-year-old
Quebecer with marriage ties to the Middle East _ was taken into
custody in Beecher Falls, Vt., after sniffer dogs trained to detect
bombmaking materials found trace amounts of explosives in her
Chrysler Neon. Accompanying Garofalo, and also still being held in
federal custody in Burlington, Vt., was Bouabide Chamchi, a
20-year-old Algerian living in Montreal, who was allegedly in
possession of an altered French passport.
</P>
<P>
   Like Ahmed Ressem, 32 _ the Algerian arrested in Washington
state last week with a carload of bombmaking gear _ Chamchi has
links to a Montreal-based ring of Algerian car thieves and break-in
artists whose criminal activities, police believe, are a way of
raising funds for terrorism abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Garofalo and Chamchi have only been charged with immigration
violations, including possession of a falsified French passport.
</P>
<P>
   However, Ressem was indicted by a federal grand jury in Seattle
Wednesday in connection with his Dec. 14 attempt to smuggle
nitroglycerine, timing devices and explosives material into the
United States from British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Ressem made his home in Montreal. News reports have linked him
to radical Islamic training camps in the Middle East. He has also
been linked to Algerian groups in France who use bank robbery and
other crimes to raise funds, a pattern similar to the groups with
which he may have been involved in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities on both sides of the border are especially alarmed
that on Dec. 6 Garofalo and an Algerian male _ tentatively
identified as Mustafa Roubici of Montreal _ crossed from Canada in
the same car in which she and Chamchi were apprehended on the later
trip. She crossed back into Canada on Dec. 12.
</P>
<P>
   In her successful entry to the United States, as as well as an
attempt on Dec. 15 in which she raised the suspicions of US border
authorities and was turned back, Garofalo went to extremely remote
border posts in Vermont and New Hampshire, none of them on a direct
route from Montreal to Boston, where she claimed to be headed. On
each occasion she was accompanied by different men of Middle
Eastern origin.
</P>
<P>
   The worst fear of investigators, although it remains only a
theory, is that on an earlier trip the car may have succesfully
carried bomb materials or terrorist operatives into the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's scarier than a carload of explosives?'' said an
investigator in Canada, answering his own rhetorical question: ``A
car with explosives residue that may have already made a successful
delivery somewhere. That's the very worst-case scenario.''
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement sources stressed, however, that the trace
amounts of explosives detected in her car could have an innocent
explanation _ such as the earlier transport of hunting weapons or
ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   A massive cross-border investigation into Garofalo, Chamchi,
Ressam, and other Montreal-based Islamic radicals continued as
federal, provincial and local police tried to piece together her
movements in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Little is known about Garofalo. According to a US official, her
husband is an Algerian recently deported from Canada who presently
resides in Europe. She may also have family ties to Libya,
according US prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 6, she and two male passengers entered the US through a
border crossing near Pittsburg, N.H., guarded only by a
surveillance camera and two-way speakers. A US immigration official
questioned her via the speaker but did not require the three
travelers to report to the nearest manned border post to show
identification.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 12, she returned to Canada at Stanstead, Quebec,
accompanied by the man identified as Roubici. Although he carried
no travel documents, he told Canadian authorities he was an
Algerian living in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   He was permitted to enter Canada, although officials there
reported his movement to US immigration officials since he appeared
to have been in the United States illegally.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 15, Garofalo attempted to enter the United States at
Pittsburg again. She was accompanied by a man who identified
himself as Ahmed Saheen of Pakistan. Because of the odd time, 2:35
a.m. and her curious route from Montreal, the US border inspector
grilled her more closely over the speaker system, and instructed
her to open the trunk of the vehicle. The surveillance camera
showed it to be full of boxes and luggage. She was instructed to
come around to a manned border station, but instead, law
enforcement officials say, she drove back to Canada.
</P>
<P>
   On all occasions, Garofalo said her destination was Boston.
</P>
<P>
   One law enforcment source speculated that Garofalo may work as a
``mule'' carrying illegal immigrants from the Middle East into the
United States, and may have no specific knowledge of their plans or
what they have in their possession.
</P>
<P>
   The Algerian facing charges in Seattle, Ressam, is suspected of
being an operative for a loose group of Islamic radicals with
connections to Canada and France. He had lived in Montreal after
applying for refugee status upon arriving in Canada from France in
February 1994. He claimed that the Algerian military had
``unjustly'' accused him of ``arms dealing'' on behalf of Islamic
radicals, according to Canadian news reports.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact he arrived carrying a fake French passport and
other falsified documents, Ressam was allowed to remain in Canada
with no restrictions other than a requirement that he check in
monthly with immigration authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials have not established a clear
connection between Ressam and Garofalo or Chamchi, the pair
arrested in Vermont. But sources said all three have strong links
to an underground of Algerian radicals residing in Montreal and
involved in criminal enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam was arrested on at least three occasions and convicted
once on charges of breaking into motor vehicles and stealing items
such as computers and cellphones. Chamchi has been charged at least
twice with stealing cars and breaking into motor vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Such crimes are the trademark of an Montreal-based Algerian
group, with links to France, suspected of using car theft and
extortion to raise money for ``financing terrorism,'' said a
Canadian intelligence official.
</P>
<P>
   According to authorities, Chamchi was in possession of an
``altered'' French passport in the name of Boudjemaa Ben Ali when
arrested in Vermont _ much as Ressam had carried false French
papers on his original entry to Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Chamchi and Garofalo told US officials that they drove
accidentally into Vermont while ``looking for a retaurant,''
according to federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   Canada Wednesday bowed to intense pressure from the United
States and critics at home to intensify anti-terrorist security at
airports and other entry points. The precautions include a
beefed-up guard by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police outside the US
Embassy in Ottawa. Closer checks of people entering Canada from
overseas were also being made at airports.

YANKEES TRADE IRABU TO MONTREAL 
</HEADLINE>

clients. Nonsubscribers can make individual purchase by calling
1-888-603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.) (th) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He was the American League pitcher of the month once
in each of the last two seasons, displaying the kind of dazzling
pitching the Yankees anticipated when they spent months three years
ago trying to secure the right to sign Hideki Irabu.
</P>
<P>
   But in too many other months Irabu confounded the Yankees with
his efforts, creating more consternation than congratulations.
</P>
<P>
   Those other months, plus the presence of Ed Yarnall, a young
left-hander, prompted the Yankees to look for a trade, and
Wednesday they sent the Japanese pitcher to another country. They
shipped him to the Montreal Expos for a minor league pitcher, Jake
Westbrook, and two young players to be selected from a short list
the teams agreed to.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos' new controlling owner, Jeffrey Loria, was so eager to
acquire Irabu, whose approval was needed for a trade to Montreal,
that he agreed to restructure the option year in his contract for
2001. The Expos guaranteed $2.5 million of the $4 million salary
and provided for more of it to be guaranteed incrementally
depending on the number of innings Irabu pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not doing this for the short term,'' said Loria, who
earlier in the week signed Graeme Lloyd, a former teammate of Irabu
to a three-year, $9 million contract. ``We're interested in
improving the starting rotation and he'll be one of the top three
starters. He's a tremendous addition to this rotation. Hideki's got
one of the meanest split-fingers I've ever seen. The exit sign has
been taken down, and we're looking to bring in quality players.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Nomura, the 30-year-old right-hander's agent, said Irabu was
``somewhat surprised'' by the trade, ``but he's happy with the deal
we cut with Montreal. He's happy that he's wanted up there. Jeff
Loria certainly was a big thing. He really supports Hideki.''
</P>
<P>
   Loria supported him with his checkbook. Irabu has a $2 million
salary for next season. Under the deal with the Expos, if he
pitches 150 innings next season, his 2001 salary will be $3
million; if 165 innings, $3.5 million; if 180 innings, the full $4
million.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees were interested in opening a spot in their rotation
for Yarnall, who impressed them with his aggressive style of
pitching during two brief stays with the team last season.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what the Yankees like about Yarnall, general manager Brian
Cashman said, ``What's not to like? He has no scare. He's
deceptive. His fastball gets right on the hitter in a deceptive
way. His arm angle makes him deceptive. Lefties and righties aren't
comfortable against him. Having the ability to pitch with deception
is key today, especially coming from the left side.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't that long ago that Yankees officials were talking that
glowingly about Irabu. More recently, however, the words that
reverberated around his name were fat and toad, which together
formed an appellation hung on him by George Steinbrenner, who was
displeased with Irabu's pitching and fielding effort in spring
training exhibition games.
</P>
<P>
   But in the winter of 1996-97, the owner was Irabu's No. 1 fan.
The San Diego Padres owned rights to him, but the Yankees pressed
them to trade those rights as Irabu made it known that he would
sign only with the Yankees. The Yankees gave the Padres $3 million
in the deal that was made April 22, 1997, then signed the pitcher
five weeks later to a four-year, $12.8 million contract.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When Irabu made his first major league start, against Detroit
July 10 of that season, he produced the kind of performance the
hype had promised, getting eight of his first 12 outs on strikeouts
and limiting the Tigers to two runs and five hits in 6 2/3 innings.
But Brian Hunter, the Tigers' center fielder, offered a note of
caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure he had some nice stuff,'' Hunter said, ``but you get a
team with a little more experience, he's not going to have that
success.''
</P>
<P>
   Five days later the Cleveland Indians battered Irabu for five
runs and nine hits in five innings.
</P>
<P>
   In May of 1998, Irabu was named AL pitcher of the month for his
4-1 record and 1.44 earned run average in six starts. But he had a
winning record in only one other month that season. He was pitcher
of the month again last July for his 4-0 record and 2.64 ERA in six
starts. That stretch was part of an eight-game winning streak that
lasted into August.
</P>
<P>
   ``He carried us with eight consecutive wins,'' Cashman said.
``We saw those flashes of brilliance that attracted us. But
obviously there were times when there were inconsistencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Cashman said that maybe Irabu will benefit from the change. ``He
was always under the microscope in New York,'' the general manager
said. ``Maybe he can relax more in Montreal, where expectations
aren't as high. In New York it's a tough situation. It's not for
everybody. I'm not saying it wasn't for Hideki. But playing
elsewhere can be easier for some players. That might be the case
with Hideki.''
</P>
<P>
   Yarnall came to the Yankees last February in the trade that sent
Mike Lowell, a young third baseman, to Florida. But Yarnall began
his professional career as the Mets' third-round pick in the 1996
amateur draft. He was part of the package the Mets gave the Marlins
for Mike Piazza in May, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In two starts and three relief appearances with the Yankees last
season, he had a 1-0 record and 3.71 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Westbrook was Colorado's first-round pick in the same draft but
now has been traded twice. The Rockies sent him to the Expos two
years ago in a deal for second baseman Mike Lansing. A 22-year-old
right-handed starter, he had an 11-5 record and 3.92 ERA for Class
AA Harrisburg last season. He has a 41-25 record in four minor
league seasons.

ANOTHER RENOIR MASTERPIECE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: EMBARGOED until Friday, Dec. 24) 
By ROB LOWMAN 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To be banned by the fascist states of Germany and Italy is
almost badge of honor enough. But the 1937 ``Grand Illusion'' is
undoubtedly a masterpiece in world cinema.
</P>
<P>
   Now the masterpiece has been digitally remastered so it is as
close to its original as we can hope and has been released on DVD
(Criterion; $39.95) with a number of extras, including a rare
filmed introduction by director Jean Renoir, a radio presentation
of Renoir and actor Erich von Stroheim accepting the film's best
foreign film award at the 1938 New York Film Critics Circle Awards,
essays on the film and cast bios.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, the film is a prisoner-of-war-escape tale, but
as critic Pauline Kael wrote, that's ``like saying that `Oedipus
Rex' is a detective story.''' Indeed, it is a graceful and
persuasive commentary about the borders and barriers that people
erect _ whether by class or nationalities.
</P>
<P>
   Renoir, the son of impressionist painter Pierre Auguste Renoir,
had as much of an impact on moving pictures as his father did on
still lifes. What set Renoir apart was his ability to imbue his
artistic concerns with a humanistic vision. Renoir followed
``Illusion'' with another masterpiece _ ``Rules of the Game'' _
before he had to flee to Hollywood, where his career suffered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Renoir has a lot of talent, but he isn't one of us,''
commented producer Darryl F. Zanuck, which explains a lot. Even
after he returned to Europe following World War II, Renoir never
regained his touch.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, we have ``Grand Illusion,'' which boast a number of
wonderful performances. The story, which takes place during World
War I, revolves around three French officers _ an aristocrat
(Pierre Fresnay), a rich Jewish banker (Marcel Dalio) and a
working-class captain (Jean Gabin) _ who are imprisoned in a German
prisoner-of-war camp run by an effete, arrogant German officer (von
Stroheim).
</P>
<P>
   Not unexpectedly, the French and German aristocrats share a
deeper cultural and class bond than they do with the middle-class
men of their own countries. And it's through these class divisions
that Renoir approaches his themes. While Kael calls the film an
``elegy for the death of the old European aristocracy,'' Renoir's
real affection is for humanity in general _ and our foibles.
</P>
<P>
   Take von Stroheim's character Von Rauffenstein: Renoir imbues
the stiff prison commander with a poignancy despite his inherent
ridiculousness. Trapped in his 19th-century aristocratic ways
during a brutal 20th-century war, Von Rauffenstein is as much a
prisoner as his inmates. That is Renoir's way of allowing us to see
the box in which he has put himself while not sacrificing the
character's human qualities.
</P>
<P>
   There are few directors that could do that well, and that is
only a very small part of a very large theme in a great movie. If
you haven't seen it, you're missing a big piece of cinematic
history. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
Recommended viewing &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It could be a long weekend, particularly if you have relatives
over that you're less than fond of. So, to help you survive, here
are some recommendations of recent films (in no particular order)
that you may have overlooked: Eric Rohmer's ``Autumn Tale''; Wim
Wenders' ``Buena Vista Social Club''; Robert Altman's ``Cookie's
Fortune''; ``Election,'' with Reese Witherspoon's Golden
Globe-nominated performance; the Watergate satire ``Dick''; ``The
Harmonists,'' a true story of a Jewish singing group in Nazi
Germany; ``The Red Violin,'' with Samuel L. Jackson; ``A Midsummer
Night's Dream,'' with Calista Flockhart and Kevin Kline; the
offbeat thriller ``Run Lola Run''; and Spike Lee's ``Summer of
Sam.'' &QL;

   BUCHAREST, Romania _ Iona Berbelescu wasn't going to let the
young man whose life she saved 10 years ago be forgotten. But she
was upset at how few other Romanians cared. There were 20 fat
wreaths from political parties leaning against the stone crosses in
University Square, but precious few of what she had brought _ a
single red carnation.
</P>
<P>
   In the chill wind blowing over the puddles where a wet snowstorm
had been stamped into slush, it took her five minutes to light her
candle, and then it guttered out against a wreath.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, on the night of Dec. 21, this square was jammed
with students demanding an end to the dictatorship of Nicolae
Ceausescu, waving the blue-yellow-red flags of Romania with
circular holes where the Communist Party emblem had been cut out.
</P>
<P>
   After darkness fell, armored cars had raced through the plaza,
then doubled back and opened fire. Red tracer bullets zipped into
some students; others were simply run down. A boy named Marius had
seen a friend nearly beheaded by a soldier swinging his trench
shovel; he had panicked and run to a girlfriend's house nearby. She
wouldn't let him in. Mrs. Berbelescu, a single mother with a
12-year-old daughter at home, had.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Ceausescu were still alive, I'd be in prison now,'' she
said, by way of explaining why she'd returned.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the police closed Magheru Boulevard to permit big
ceremonies at the crosses, which are on a traffic divider. Someone
had placed hundreds of candles in red jars along the center lane
dividers. They hardly needed to have bothered.
</P>
<P>
   The 1 p.m. wreath-laying ceremony drew fewer than 100 people.
The rest of the day saw a trickle of people like Mrs. Berbelescu.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, Romania was the only Eastern European country
whose government fell in a blood-soaked revolution. A richer
nation, a better-run nation, a nation less politically divided
would be treating itself to a huge 10th birthday party this week as
Germany and the Czech Republic did earlier this year. But Romania
is not a nation happy about itself.
</P>
<P>
   At 12:08 p.m. Wednesday, exactly 10 years from the moment when
the presidential helicopter snatched Ceausescu off the roof of the
Communist Party headquarters as a mob of 100,000 was surging
through its doors to lynch him, nothing much was happening. The
square outside the building on whose roof Ceausescu once stood was
full of parked cars.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs, Ion Iliescu, Romania's president from 1989 to 1996 and
leading in the polls for next year's vote, was alone in his office.
Ten years ago, he had pulled together the National Salvation Front
that took over after Ceausescu fled and that executed the dictator
and his wife three days later.
</P>
<P>
   Iliescu had spent the morning visiting the crucial spots of Dec.
22, 1989, with his comrades of those days: this building itself,
with the balcony from which Ceausescu had retreated from the booing
crowd; Studio 4 of the national television station, where Iliescu
had first told the nation, ``The dictator has fled''; the TV
conference room where the National Salvation Front was drawing up a
new constitution when bullets began crashing in.
</P>
<P>
   Only one reporter was there to walk with him. When he entered
Studio 4 to reminisce with the staff for half an hour, a monitor in
the corner showed what the station was broadcasting just then: a
movie about a giant squid.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Live television hasn't been Romania's forte since the
revolution, when it galvanized the nation but also poured forth the
rumors that knotted the country in fratricidal chaos: that Libyan
terrorists were fighting to save the Ceausescus, that the tapwater
was poisoned, that the Soviets were invading.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing a reporter along by the arm, Iliescu pointed out the
bullet holes in the window frames and broadcast equipment. The
trajectories showed that, as he said, some had been fired from a
helicopter. He pointed out the radiator that the fledgling
government had huddled behind, and the glass bridge between
buildings that they had crawled across, cut by flying glass but
missed by bullets. He described the man in the parking lot who drew
a pistol at his approach but was clubbed on the arm by a soldier
and ran off in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Even now, no one knows who started the shooting that evening,
which went on for five nights and faded only after the Ceausescus'
corpses were shown on television. The assumption is that the
bullets came from small, loyal sniper squads trying to create
panic, which they did.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a problem,'' Iliescu said. ``Over 1,000 people were
questioned, but it was never concretized _ who fired from here, who
organized this attack. Aren't there questions left over from your
Civil War? Look how long you investigated who shot Kennedy, and it
was only one man _ or maybe two.''
</P>
<P>
   Lingering mysteries aside, he was asked, why aren't average
citizens part of this anniversary? Why can't the nine political
parties _ including those that defeated him in 1996 _ get together
and celebrate just for a day?
</P>
<P>
   ``We did have speeches in Parliament about the revolution two
days ago,'' he answered. ``But the people are disappointed,
generally dissatisfied with life that is worse than it was in 1989.
And the people in power now are not those who were connected with
the revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, private TV stations and newspapers have made an
effort, using old pictures and new interviews with the principals.
But the coverage is largely mournful and angry: it concentrates on
those maimed, widowed or left childless. It describes their poverty
now, and their angry belief that their sacrifices were betrayed by
politicians, including Iliescu.
</P>
<P>
   The mood is not celebratory. Some Romanians say the government
fears riots, since a third of the country lives on less than $2 a
day and blames the government. The current president was shouted
down during a Dec. 1 speech and his prime minister was forced to
resign this month. The new government was sworn in Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, a street party that echoed 1989 _ two armored
cars were parked beneath a screen on which clips of the fighting
were projected and, this time, artificial fireworks went off _ drew
only about 1,200 people to the same square that held 100,000 a
decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the event started well behind schedule _ as someone there
pointed out, ``It's much colder than it was that night.''

LENGTHY US-CANADA BORDER REPLETE WITH LEAKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forest City, Maine, with its winter population of five, is
hardly a hot spot for illegal immigration from Canada. So trusting
are Immigration and Naturalization Service officials that,
normally, only a surveillance camera guards the border crossing
after the federal agent goes home for the day.
</P>
<P>
   But a lot has changed this week.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since the Persian Gulf War in 1991, US border
officials have been put on a heightened state of alert, and they
are particularly concerned about the 798-mile stretch of the border
along New England. Not only is the rural, wooded border lightly
guarded, but it is near the major Canadian cities of Montreal and
Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, smugglers of everything from cigarettes to
illegal aliens have found the New England border an easy target.
But the arrests this week in Vermont of two people amid speculation
they may be involved in terrorism has cast the smuggling issue in a
more sinister light.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned about the border out here. I'm wondering if it's
possible for (terrorists) to go across because it is such a remote
area. It would be an easy job at night,'' said Donna Gilman,
postmaster in Brookton, which provides mail to Forest City. ``It
gives me pause.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Immigration and Naturalization Service say they
have ratcheted up security along the 5,500-mile US-Canadian border
more as a precaution than in response to a specific threat.
Christmas vacations for Border Patrol agents are being cancelled,
and staff increased so that no one works alone and all official
border checkpoints, including tiny Forest City, have 24-hour
staffing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be on the safe side,'' said Raymond Kelly, director
of the US Customs Service, which manages border checkpoints along
with INS. ``It's prudent. It's not in response to any specific
threat. We just think it's wise to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   But, with only 107 Border Patrol agents assigned to guard the
entire region, some federal law enforcement officials believe more
are needed to pose a real threat to border jumpers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone wants to carry out an intelligent plan to cross the
border undetected, I'd say the chances of them getting through are
pretty good,'' said Jay McCloskey, the U.S. Attorney for Maine, who
has prosecuted numerous immigration cases during a 20-year-career.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's arrest of Bouabide Chamchi, an Algerian, along with
Canadian Lucia Garofalo, at the border crossing in Beecher Falls in
northeastern Vermont came very close to home for some people.
Coupled with the earlier arrest of an Algerian Ahmed Ressam in
Washington on charges of trying to smuggle bomb-making supplies
into the country, it put a threatening new focus on the world's
longest open border.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that some of these entry locations may have been
identified by terrorist groups and we've cancelled all annual
leave,'' said Roland Richardson, deputy chief with the US Border
Patrol in Houlton, Maine. ``All of our agents are on the job and
happy to be there given the possibility of entries that could be
coming through here.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the US-Canada border, unlike the US border with
Mexico, was never designed to be leak-proof. Families live on both
sides of the border in communities such as Calais, Maine, and St.
Stephen, New Brunswick, while part of the library in Derby, Vt., is
actually in Canada. For these communities, frequent border
crossings are a way of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``People might cross the border three times a day coming to the
store, going to visit grandma or whatever,'' said Jean Ouellette,
deputy director of the Immigration and Natural Service regional
office in Portland, Maine, noting these people tend to support
measures making border crossing easier.
</P>
<P>
   Ouellette estimates that one-third of the 15 million people who
enter New England from Canada each year come through just three
stations, including Calais. Some of the 36 other official border
crossings in the region, such as Pittsburg, N.H., receive fewer
than 100 border crossings a day.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, for long stretches of the 600-mile Maine border
with Canada, only unguarded logging roads connect the two
countries. In such rural areas, border crossers are either subject
to video surveillance or directed by a sign to check in at the
nearest staffed border crossing.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, New England's frontier has sometimes been
targeted by smugglers of both humans and material goods. Slightly
west of New England, the most notorious smuggling route is the
Akwesasne Mohawk Reserve between New York State and Ontario, near
Quebec. Illegal immigrants pay Indian guides to bring them to the
United States side every year, counting on Canadian and American
reluctance to crack down on an Indian reserve.
</P>
<P>
   However, Marcus Russell at the Immigration and Naturalization
Service in Houlton, Maine, estimates that less than one-tenth of
one percent of the 15 million people who come from Canada into New
England each year are attempting to do something illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Border Patrol agents detained just 3,025 people in the
last fiscal year in New England and eastern New York, a tiny
fraction of those arrested entering the United States from Mexico.
Some say the low numbers reflect the fact that the Border Patrol
has just 107 agents to patrol almost 1,000 miles of border, but
federal officials say sensors and video cameras hidden in the woods
increase the reach of their force.
</P>
<P>
   Along the border Wednesday, some residents accepted federal
reassurances, noting that many of these border regions are so tight
knit that strangers stand out.
</P>
<P>
   ``People know everybody here . . . Even if you cross in the
middle of a field here, someone's going to see you and you'll get
caught.'' John Martin of Richford, Vt.
</P>

WEB START-UP KNOWS VALUE OF ITS CONVENTIONAL BACK-OFFICE WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: optional sidebar at end of story) 
(bl) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jonas Lee has a Harvard M.B.A. and has worked for a
blue-chip management consulting firm. But he now knows that no
business school course or consulting firm project can possibly
prepare you for the daily frenzy at an Internet start-up,
particularly during a make-or-break holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   Lee is the 33-year-old president of GiftCertificates.com, an
online marketer of gift certificates. He ticks off a list of minor
mishaps, including running out of glue sticks used to seal
envelopes at 2 a.m. (``You go to every all-night convenience store
you can find'') and trying to fix an ink-choked printer that was
ruining envelopes at 3 a.m. (``You race out to the 24-hour Home
Depot in Queens and get a little vacuum cleaner.'')
</P>
<P>
   The fortunes of GiftCertificates.com, like those of so many
Internet retailers, will be determined largely by how well it copes
with such mundane matters as order-handling, packing, shipping and
answering customers' questions over the phone. And that means it
must deftly manage and motivate the people who do this work _ not
M.B.A.'s or techies, the expected dot-com denizens, but mostly high
school graduates.
</P>
<P>
   This is the home truth about e-commerce, as the Internet becomes
more mainstream _ that so much of it is old-fashioned ``commerce''
instead of the technological wizardry of ``E.''
</P>
<P>
   GiftCerticates.com occupies two floors of a building on Seventh
Avenue and 35th Street in Manhattan's garment district. Most of the
management team, the Web site designers and software programmers
are on the sixth floor, while the customer service, order-tracking,
packing and shipping operations are two floors up.
</P>
<P>
   The eighth floor hums through three shifts, round-the-clock,
with workers fielding customer calls in one room and tracking,
packing and shipping gift-certificates in another room. Work in the
order room is called ``feeding the green dragon,'' because the
small conveyor belt that ferries gray trays filled with
gift-certificate orders has a green metal frame.
</P>
<P>
   The floor is staffed mainly by workers in their teens to 30s,
mostly black and Hispanic, graduates of the city's public high
schools. They are paid hourly wages, and many are hired just for
the holiday season. Jeans and sweatshirts are the order of the day.
Two workers have brought their radios, one tuned to a rap station,
the other playing classic soul.
</P>
<P>
   Such hires have brought the GiftCertificates.com payroll to
roughly 140 people, more than double its size three months ago.
Among the temporary workers is Sparkle Taylor, 19, who says she has
had seven or eight jobs in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Taylor, a customer service representative, sits at a
personal computer, wearing a headset and navigating through
information on the company's Web site to answer questions. Some
callers want information about the more than 200 retailers and
restaurants whose gift certificates the company offers. Others are
newcomers to online shopping and simply want someone to talk them
through the process of buying by computer.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Taylor has done telephone work before, selling long-distance
service for a phone company and doing surveys for a market research
firm. ``That was all outbound _ people can get very hostile,'' she
said. ``In customer service, they need you. I like it here.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Like other temporary workers at GiftCertificates.com, she said
the company was paying pretty good wages _ $12 an hour in customer
service and $10.50 an hour in order fulfillment.
</P>
<P>
   The holiday season also provides an audition for permanent jobs.
``My short-term goal is to have them keep me full time,'' said Ms.
Taylor, who joined the company three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   If the company does well, Lee said, the plan is to keep a
payroll of 100 to 110 people, meaning about half of the temps would
be offered permanent jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stars have already been identified,'' Lee noted. ``You can
tell who really cares, especially in a wartime situation like
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Jose Camacho, who works in the order fulfillment room, is a
permanent worker at the company and a veteran by the standards of
GiftCertificates.com. He joined at the end of August, leaving a job
as a purchasing manager in art supplies store. Three months later
was promoted from fulfillment representative to supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yep, I'm moving up the ladder,'' said Camacho, 28, during his
4 p.m. to 1 a.m. shift last Wednesday. ``I've been here almost four
months and it feels like four years,'' he added, offering a
shop-floor view of Internet time as hiring, training and production
all go on all at once.
</P>
<P>
   Motivational signs alongside the conveyor belt encourage workers
to ``Do Us Proud'' and show the target number of orders to be
handled hourly at each station. A sign above the urinal in the
men's room reminds them of the ``Eight Steps'' in the fulfillment
process; a day earlier, there were ``Seven Steps.'' When a new
shipping record was set last week, each worker in the department
was given a $25 bonus on the spot _ in gift certificates.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   (The eighth-floor work force is proof that personal affluence
and technological literacy do is not necessarily go hand in hand.
Even though Ms. Taylor does not yet own a personal computer, she
has two free e-mail accounts, which she uses from friends'
computers or from work. Camacho learned of the job opening at
GiftCertificates.com one Sunday evening while browsing through
online classified ads using his WebTV.)
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   To further motivate its employees, both management and hourly,
GiftCertificates.com is offering stock options to every full-time
worker, as many Internet start-ups do.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``You bet the stock options are a big deal to me,'' said
Amaryllis Diaz, 28, a supervisor in the customer service
department.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Diaz left a customer-service job at an industrial printing
company she had held for years. Like others in operations at the
Internet start-up, who are typically paid annual salaries of
$20,000 to $40,000, she said she wanted to ``get in on a company
that had a lot of potential, just as it was taking off. It just
seemed more exciting than my other job.''
</P>
<P>
   She views stock options not as the equivalent of a winning
lottery ticket _ as they can be for the founding executives of a
startup _ but as potentially providing a modest nest egg. ``I've
got two kids,'' Ms. Diaz said. ``It could be a nice bonus.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The financial calculus of joining an Internet start-up was more
complicated for the 10 members of the management team at
GiftCertificates.com. If things go well, the payoff for them could
be many millions of dollars, but the risk can be greater, too, at
least in the near term.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Stephenson, the company's 35-year-old chief financial
officer, abandoned a roughly $1 million-a-year job as an investment
banker at Merrill Lynch in August to go to GiftCertificates.com,
where his salary is about one-tenth as much. Leland Harden, 37, the
executive vice president for business development, walked away from
$5 million in unexercised stock options, at current prices, when he
left a larger Internet company in April.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   When they speak of why they came on board, they sound very much
like Ms. Diaz. ``You can try to think it to death all you like,
but, heck, you really do it for the adventure,'' Harden said.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a shared adventure this holiday season on the eighth
floor. Every member of the management team pitches in to take
shifts ``picking and packing'' in the fulfillment department. So do
family members, including Stephenson's wife, Cathy, who is
expecting the couple's first child on Christmas eve.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Special steps have been taken for the eighth-floor employees.
Last week, for example, a masseuse was brought in to ease the
strain on the weary necks and shoulders of those picking and
packing at a frenetic pace.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Lee is often there, packing envelopes, picking trash off the
floor and offering words of praise and encouragement. ``A big part
of my job is being a cheerleader, doing things for people and
showing them you care,'' he said. ``If you don't, there is a real
potential for an upstairs-downstairs, us-and-them mentality to set
in. We can't afford that.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   With only two days left till Christmas, GiftCertificates.com
stands a chance of being one of the emboldened survivors of the
Internet winter of 1999. Its goal for the holiday season was about
$20 million in sales, and a steady surge of orders recently has
made that target seem attainable. ``A few weeks ago, I was worried
that we wouldn't hit it,'' Lee said. ``It's been a nail-biting
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   His anxiety is explained by the pace at which money is going out
the door. GiftCertificates.com, which raised roughly $24 million
this year in venture capital, plans to spend $12 million in the
last three months of the year on advertising alone _ in newspapers
and magazines, on billboards and buses, and over the radio,
featuring actress Sophia Loren as the Web site's spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The venture backers are optimistic but not patient. William
Ackman of Gotham Partners, a New York investment firm and a large
shareholder, observed, ``We'll know whether this company succeeds
or fails before long. Sometime next year.''
</P>
<P>

   &UR; GIFT CERTIFICATES MAY PROVIDE NICHE FOR A FEW E-COMMERCE FIRMS &QL; 
 &LR;   &UR; By STEVE LOHR &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   GiftCertificates.com is one of a handful of Internet start-ups
trying to build an online marketplace for gift certificates. The
Web retailing category, analysts say, may well prove to be a good
niche business for the winners.
</P>
<P>
   ``One or two of these companies could emerge with businesses of
a couple hundred million dollars annually over the next 5 or 10
years,'' said Ken Cassar, an analyst for Jupiter Communications.
``But I can't see one of these companies ever becoming a
multibillion-dollar business.''
</P>
<P>
   The business thinking behind a company like GiftCertificates.com
is that gift certificates are a sizable market _ more than $11
billion a year _ that is waiting to be transformed by the Internet.
Like books or records, gift certificates are something that
consumers do not necessarily have to inspect in person before
purchasing. And for most retailers, gift certificates represent a
couple of percent of yearly sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``For most retailers, gift certificates are an afterthought,''
said Jonas Lee, the president. ``For us, it's the only thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Retailers do tend to view gift certificate Web sites as a
complement to their bricks-and-mortar businesses instead of as a
threat.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``We see working with them as a way to drive business to our
stores _ a person who receives a gift certificate walks through our
doors to use it,'' said Michele Cerwin, a marketing executive at
Chanel Inc., one of the more than 200 retailers and restaurants
that offer their certificates on GiftCertificates.com.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   at GiftCertificates.com executives talk hopefully of helping to
transform the image of their product from a last-minute option into
``a new category, more of an everyday expression of love and
affection,'' said Bertina Ceccarelli, executive vice president for
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The company's offerings are shipped in a variety of packaging,
from gold envelopes to a velvet case with a ribbon. Web resellers
like GiftCertificates.com buy their certificates from retailers at
a 10 to 20 percent discount from their face value _ a discount
retailers are willing to offer because many consumers either don't
use the full value of the certificates or go to a store to use a
gift certificate and then buy additional merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   And as with certificates sold to anyone, the retailers also get
the immediate use of the cash on certificates they sell to
resellers before they are exchanged for goods.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   GiftCertificates.com and Giftpoint.com, analysts say, seem to be
the early leaders. In November, the most recent month for which
data is available from Media Metrix, a Web traffic monitor,
Giftpoint.com had slightly more visitors than GiftCertificates.com,
and both were well ahead of other rivals, including Flooz.com and
Webcertificates.com.
</P>
<P>
   More important than window shoppers, of course, are buyers. In
November, GiftCertificates.com showed the largest gain in online
purchases of any Web site from the previous month, up 462 percent,
according to Nextcard, which tracks the Internet buying of 100,000
Visa card holders. Still, its previous sales were modest, so it is
not yet clear how significant, or lasting, such a surge will prove
to be.
</P>
<P>
   There are hopeful signs, but they are preliminary ones at best.

LEADS IN TERRORISM THREAT LINKED TO BOSTON

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ US authorities were tracking leads from around the
world Wednesday amid worries over end-of-the-year terror attacks
following the arrests in Vermont and Washington state of two
Algerian men, one of whom sought to enter the United States with
bomb-making materials.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle Wednesday, a federal grand jury indicted Ahmed
Ressam, 32, who was charged with transporting explosives,
possessing unregistered firearms, smuggling nitroglycerin, and
giving false information to border guards.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the new leads, US officials said, were linked to New
England, specifically the Boston area. In addition, there was
generalized concern about higher risk in New England because of the
ease in slipping across the porous US-Canada border.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, seeking to awaken Americans to the threat of
terrorist attacks in the coming days and weeks, asked the public to
be watchful for any suspicious activity _ and if witnessed, to
contact police. Still, he said that Americans should not ``stop
their holiday activities. I think they ought to go and enjoy the
season.''
</P>
<P>
   In New England, one investigation focused on a Montreal woman,
arrested Sunday with Algerian native Bouabide Chamchi at the remote
Beecher Falls, Vt., crossing. She successfully crossed the
US-Canada border earlier in December with two Algerian nationals,
telling border officials her destination was Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators were also seeking three men in connection with a
bombing plot in Jordan, one of whom was last known to live at 15
Appleton St. in Everett, Mass. and has a Massachusetts driving
license. He was identified by law enforcement sources as Raed
Hajazi, 21.
</P>
<P>
   In the White House and at the State Department, Defense
Department, and other national security agencies, debate flourished
for the third consecutive day on how best to alert the public to
the threats while trying not to ruin the holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Said one US official who attended several of the high-level
meetings: ``The problem is, how do you make people concerned but
not send them running to the bomb shelters?''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, after visiting a Washington soup kitchen, said, ``For
all citizens, I would say they ought to go about their holidays and
enjoy themselves and make the most of it. But I would ask them to
just be aware of their circumstances and, if they see anything
suspicious, to report it immediately, and meanwhile to know that we
are doing everything we possibly can.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the government was making ``extraordinary efforts . . .
based on the incident out in the Pacific Northwest and what we
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities, however, still had not made any definitive
connection between the Algerian-born Ressem and Osama bin Laden, a
wealthy Saudi Arabian sought by the United States for masterminding
the 1998 US embassy bombings in Africa. There is a widespread
assumption among intelligence officials that Ressem has ties to bin
Laden associates, likely during time he spent in France three years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Carefully choosing his words at a news conference, Deputy
Attorney General Eric Holder assessed the threat of a terrorist
attack: ``We do not have any specific information about particular
targets.''
</P>
<P>
   US officials said Holder, and other top US officials, had agreed
to stick to the phrases ``specific information'' and ``particular
targets'' because they were technically true and also useful in
alleviating fears. US intelligence officials, though, had amassed
several leads on general threats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we have general reporting that concerns us? Absolutely,''
said an administration official, speaking on condition of
anonymity. ``That's why we have have taken steps to raise the alert
status on the borders and issued the two warnings'' for Americans
living or travelling overseas.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department issued a second warning late Tuesday that
said, ``The US government believes that terrorists may be planning
to conduct attacks including against official and non-official
Americans, in and around the New Year period (from now through
mid-January 2000) with particular emphasis on locations where large
groups of people may congregate for millennial or religious
festivities.''
</P>
<P>
   US officials believe that if a terrorist group decides to attack
Americans it could happen anywhere in the world, and it could
happen in coordinated fashion in multiple locations. In August
1998, bin Laden's organization was believed responsible for two
almost simultaneous attacks on US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania
that killed more than 200 people.
</P>
<P>
   If terrorist attacks were to happen in the United States, the
most vulnerable places may be New England, New York City and parts
of the West Coast, US officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very concerned the Osama bin Laden group has cells set
up in New York, a little on the West Coast, and in quieter areas of
the upper East Coast, such as Connecticut, Massachusetts, New
Hampshire, Vermont and Maine,'' said a second US official, speaking
on condition of anonymity and refusing to give further details.
``The reason we're so concerned about New England is that there has
been so little attention paid in the past to the border crossings
up there.'' Those border crossings have been substantially
tightened in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, another US official said he believed the government
warnings made it safer for people to attend public gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about specific information on threats in New England, the
official said, ``Anyone who was not taking these threats seriously
is taking it seriously now. It's going to be important for First
Night in Boston, and all the other First Nights going on around New
England, that people are vigilant. In the end, that benefits
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli expert on terrorism, Boaz Ganor, said the arrests of
the two Algerian men _ if either or both are linked to terrorist
plans _ may break up a ring of terrorists. ``There is going to be
concern about what those people say in custody,'' Ganor said.
</P>
<P>
   But Neil Livingstone, chairman of GlobalOptions, a security and
crisis management company in Washington, said he believed the
arrests represented only the ``tip of the iceberg'' of terrorists'
plans.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted 10 to 15 terrorist attacks globally around the turn
of the millennium, possibly coming from several groups ``because
terrorists know that by marking the millennium with whatever they
do, they will be immortalized.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingstone and several US officials noted that the threat
worldwide was perhaps greatest in Jordan and Israel, where
authorities expect upward of 1.5 million tourists to descend on the
tiny state in the holiday season. Also vulnerable are US troops
stationed in Bosnia because of lax security around the borders, US
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But Livingstone said from a terrorist's perspective, the biggest
target remains the United States. ``If you can score the United
States, that's like getting center on the bull's eye,'' he said.

CHINA'S INTERNET USERS GAIN SOME FREEDOM OF SPEECH IN CYBERSPACE 
</HEADLINE>
 (TRIMS) -NYT  (See also CHINA-ONLINE-BIZ, moved in `f' category)

 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ On a recent evening, Zhang Aijing sat at her terminal
at the Internet division of People's Daily, watching comments drop
from cyberspace into the Communist Party newspaper's chat room.
</P>
<P>
   An ``editor'' assigned to ``anchor'' discussions, Ms. Zhang is
also responsible for weeding out comments overly critical of the
party. With a click of her mouse, ugly thoughts disappear.
</P>
<P>
   She had just posted a notice on the site about a Western
reporter's visit and was watching intently to see what came in.
After all, unpredictable things happen here, where party propaganda
meets cyberspace and, as if to underscore that point, a screen
saver flashes smiling images of Diana, Princess of Wales, her
wedding and Prince William nearby.
</P>
<P>
   `'The U.S. is a killer _ we can't forget May 8,'' comes the
first reply, referring to the day last spring when NATO forces
bombed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade. Most Chinese reject NATO's
explanation that the attack was an accident. More angry comments
tumble in.
</P>
<P>
   But soon another message hits the screen: ``I want her to know
that we Chinese people don't like our government.'' And another:
``The Communist Party doesn't let Chinese people read newspapers
from overseas.'' The comments stand.
</P>
<P>
   `'We try to let the people speak,'' said Jiang Yaping, who heads
the Internet division, with a shrug. ``We are the main newspaper of
the party, so of course there are limits. But it would take
something much stronger than these to be removed.''
</P>
<P>
   With the ambivalent blessing of the government, locally produced
Web sites and chat rooms have spread rapidly here in the last two
years, giving China's estimated 7 million Internet users a forum
for public debate and discussion _ even a degree of dissent _ that
previously was unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   On the local Internet, Chinese are exposed to information and
opinions that could never appear in the tightly controlled Chinese
media, on topics like the crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in
Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989, and the mistreatment of people
with AIDS. Local governments are even using Web sites to poll
residents about policy issues, like bus fares.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is changing China,'' said Minxin Pei, a
researcher at the Carnegie Endowment for Peace in Washington. ``Now
we have people voting in cyberspace who cannot vote in political
space. That will certainly have an effect.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a delicate balancing act for China's leaders and for the
commercial Web sites. They must preserve the sense of freewheeling
openness that makes the Internet so popular while maintaining the
control over information and dissent that the Communist government
requires.
</P>
<P>
   For the government, the Internet has been, at times, a useful
tool: after the embassy bombing in Belgrade, for example, chat
rooms gave Chinese an outlet for their anger. But it is clearly a
double-edged sword. The banned Falun Gong spiritual group, whose
leader is now based in New York, has frequently used e-mail and the
Internet in its campaign for legal recognition and to help mobilize
its followers, although its Web sites are now blocked.
</P>
<P>
   This month, Information Minister Wu Jichuan announced that
government ministries would monitor Internet sites, but he did not
elaborate on what form that monitoring would take.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not allow the introduction of trash that is harmful to
the people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To experts, it is no surprise. ``I expect that the government
will be very deeply involved in regulating the Internet, for two
reasons,'' said Kenneth DeWoskin, a partner at
PricewaterhouseCoopers who spoke at a recent conference on the
Internet at Beijing University. ``The Chinese government has always
had a strong interest in managing information. And also, the
government has a strong commercial interest in the Net; it's a
major owner.''
</P>
<P>
   But control over a multi-headed, constantly morphing creature
like the Internet is difficult to achieve, as Chinese censors have
already learned. Although the government now restricts access to a
number of foreign Web sites, many technically savvy Beijingers know
how to get around the barricades.
</P>
<P>
   To get to The New York Times on the Web or to sites related to
Falun Gong, for example, Chinese who know the proper codes can dial
a device called a proxy server, which effectively masks the
identity of the site being visited. Some government officials use
proxy servers to read the Times Web site.
</P>
<P>
   But domestic Web sites face a great deal more direct pressure,
from readers hungry for the broadcast of more information and from
a government that wants less.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Sina.com is one of China's most popular Web sites, featuring a
creative blend of features, sports and entertainment. It runs
celebrity chat rooms, where Internet surfers can ``meet'' people
like the film director Zhang Yimou. This fall it made waves by
displaying China's first online birth: surfers could follow the
prenatal development and birth of a real baby called Dian Dian.
</P>
<P>
   But one of Sina.com's special strength is news, and that
requires especially deft handling.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike China's newspapers and magazines _ which are owned and
controlled by the government _ Sina.com is the product of a private
Chinese company, the Stone Group, which has offices in Beijing,
Hong Kong, Taiwan and California.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not under the media control of the Chinese
government,'' said Paul Jin, the executive deputy general manager
of Sina.com in Beijing. ``Still, we have to be very careful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to make sure that every article is suitable to the
Chinese government,'' Jin added, noting that the Sina.com's
mainland China Web site contained different offerings from its
Chinese-language web sites overseas. ``We make our own judgments.
News here has great value, but it also has risks.''
</P>
<P>
   When it started up just over a year ago, Sina.com included
dispatches from foreign news agencies, including Agence
France-Presse and Reuters. But after the government reiterated that
its own newspapers were not permitted to use text directly from
foreign news organizations, Sina.com dropped the practice as well.
Today, it writes some of its own dispatches but mostly buys copy
from the Chinese press.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To avoid conflicts with the government, many private Web sites
in China scrupulously avoid news _ especially political news _
altogether, even though urban Chinese are inveterate news junkies
and there is great market demand.
</P>
<P>
   And so, even though Dow Jones Co. is a major shareholder in the
Chinese web site Sohu.com, the site includes only Dow Jones'
business and financial news and not its broader news service.
</P>
<P>
   But it is in the chat rooms that the dicey stuff appears. ``We
don't worry too much about news items,'' Jin said. ``It's the chat
rooms that make us really nervous. Especially around sensitive
days, like June 4, we have to screen very carefully, since you
never know what will appear.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At Sina.com and People's Daily, the goal is to review all
comments within minutes after they drop and remove those deemed
inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   The People's Daily chat room got government permission to go
online on May 8, the day of the embassy bombing in Belgrade,
provoking an outpouring of popular anger. The chat room had already
been months in planning.
</P>
<P>
   The government ``thought that people had a lot to say at that
time,'' said Jiang, explaining the timing, ``although some people
criticized us for allowing this kind of discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he said, leaders have becoming increasingly
supportive of the enterprise, since the chat room, which gets more
than 2,000 visitors a day, gives citizens a chance to vent their
anger and also for China's officials to stay in touch with popular
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   But the heated chat room debates that occurred on many Chinese
Web sites in the month after the bombing showed that the Internet
could buttress, but also occasionally undercut, government policy.
</P>
<P>
   In early May, for example, most of the entries were attacks on
the United States, NATO and President Clinton, reflecting the
widespread view that the Chinese Embassy had been deliberately
chosen as a target.
</P>
<P>
   But by the end of the month, the anniversary of the June 4,
1989, crackdown in Tiananmen Square was fast approaching. Along
with thousands of patriotic entries, a few more controversial
thoughts occasionally made their way online _ if only for a few
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   On the chat room Netease, which was devoted to the embassy
bombing, one person ventured: ``June 4 is coming. What do you
think?'' The events of June 1989, when tanks moved into central
Beijing, killing hundreds of civilians, are among China's ultimate
political taboos.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, in a People's Daily chat room on AIDS run by an
expert from the Health Ministry, viewers got official statistics
(via the expert) as well as a embarrassing account (courtesy of a
Net surfer) of how a Chinese deputy health minister had been
heckled as he left the stage at a recent International AIDS meeting
in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Chinese take advantage of the relative anonymity provided by the
Internet to say things they might not utter in other public forums.
Although it is theoretically possible for a chat room to tell what
phone number a comment is coming from, many Chinese gain access to
the Internet through Internet cafes and it would be difficult to
connect a particular comment with a particular individual, experts
said.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts say that the quick growth of the Internet will push
the Chinese media to be more open _ and that it has done so
already.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is very international, and with the Net you
really cannot construct obstacles to prevent people from knowing
things,'' said Jiang, of People's Daily. ``So often it's better
that we inform people about something rather than have them learn
about it elsewhere. But we stand on behalf of the Chinese
government, and in some areas it better for us to keep quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   For the foreseeable future, the Chinese government will
certainly continue to try to exert control over the beast that has
been unleashed. But monitoring every entry in every chat room will
become increasingly cumbersome as the number of Internet users in
China grows.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a problem for us,'' Jiang said. ``Right now, we don't
know just what we will do.''

MEMORIES OF CHRISTMASES PAST EASE TRANSITION TO NEW AGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   My 3-foot-high Christmas tree shines brightly in one corner of
my condominium. It is there because of a sudden decision. I was
inside one of those giant stores that have almost everything, and
the little tree seemed to beckon.
</P>
<P>
   My tree was nearly as pitiful-looking as the meager tree that
Charlie Brown picked out in ``A Charlie Brown Christmas,'' that
classic TV offering and the first animated special made by the
great Charles Schulz.
</P>
<P>
   My tree was miraculously transformed, just like Charlie Brown's.
We strung red, green and yellow lights on it and added a silver
garland. A white angel with a halo glows on top. It looks good.
</P>
<P>
   Every time I walk into my living room, I switch on the lights
and admire the tree. For me, it recaptures the spirit of Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are many versions of how Christmas trees
originated, the practice stems at least partly from our
nature-worshipping ancestors in Northern Europe. They saw
evergreens as symbols of eternal life. Druids thought mistletoe was
magical.
</P>
<P>
   Some historians credit Martin Luther with starting the Christmas
tree custom. He is said to have been inspired by the sight of an
evergreen tree with bright stars shining above it. He put up his
own evergreen and decorated it with lighted candles.
</P>
<P>
   Many people without relatives at home don't bother to put up
Christmas trees. I've sometimes done that.
</P>
<P>
   But having a tree rekindles memories of the warmth and love of
past Christmases. During my childhood, our family Christmas trees
were centers of happy celebrations. We even had one of those
silvery aluminum trees. It still brightened our home.
</P>
<P>
   Starting before I can remember, our family cut our Christmas
trees from a tall evergreen on the farm where I was born in North
Texas. The tree still stands, although a little lopsided. We still
visit it. It brings back fond memories of a struggling but blessed
family.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the Christmas tree tradition is partially based on
non-Christian influences is not surprising. Early church fathers
were adept at taking over holidays of indigenous religions.
</P>
<P>
   The early church did not celebrate Christ's birthday. The focus
was on Christ's death and resurrection. Some thought it was sinful
to commemorate Christ's natural birth, believing that it diminished
his divine nature, according to ``Sacred Origins of Profound
Things,'' by Charles Panati.
</P>
<P>
   Many influences brought on the celebration of Christmas in Roman
times. One was a rival religion, called Mithraism, which was seen
as a threat to Christianity. The ruins of Mithran temples have been
excavated around the world, including one I saw last summer in the
heart of London.
</P>
<P>
   Mithra worshippers had a Dec. 25 holiday commemorating the birth
of Mithras, ``the invincible sun god.'' December was also the time
of the feast of Saturn, (Saturnalia) a time of wild merrymaking.
</P>
<P>
   When pagan festivals were outlawed during the fourth century,
the Dec. 25 date was adopted as the birthday of Jesus, according to
``The Illustrated Guide to World Religions.'' The style of
observance was prayerful, a Christ's Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Some Christian denominations, including Jehovah's Witnesses, do
not celebrate Christmas because of its association with
non-Christian festivals.
</P>
<P>
   But I prize this celebration of the birth of a child who brought
profound love into the world. During Christmas, we tend to take
more seriously Jesus' admonition to love our neighbors and even our
enemies. It is a time when we don't forget to share our love with
our family members and our friends.
</P>
<P>
   As Victor Hugo wrote in his 1862 novel ``Les Miserables,'' ``The
supreme happiness of life is the conviction that we are loved.''
And sharing that kind of love is the true meaning of this joyous
holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Merry Christmas.

 MERCHANTS WARY OVER LAST-MINUTE VISIT FROM FIRST PROCRASTINATOR 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton plans to embark on his annual
Christmas shopping trip on Friday afternoon, joining thousands of
other procrastinating holiday shoppers searching for the perfect
gift.
</P>
<P>
   The news has shopkeepers here alternating between delight and
dread at the prospect of a presidential visit and the disruption it
can create.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he is buying something, he is usually pretty generous,''
said Andrew Twillman, vice president of the Washington Pen Co. at
Union Station, a mall at the train station here. ``But if he
doesn't buy anything, you are shut down for nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Twillman, who noted that Clinton has made 11th-hour purchases
from him in the past, said that the section of the mall where the
president shops is blocked off from the rest of the shopping area.
And Clinton's last-minute shopping occurs at a prime time for
retailers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is publicity, but two hours of business as usual the day
before Christmas would be pretty good,'' Twillman added.
</P>
<P>
   Others like the novelty of seeing the president doing his own
shopping for the holiday.
</P>
<P>
   David Mowery, the historical consultant and salesman at
Political Americana, a shop in the Union Station mall that sells
political memorabilia, said he was expecting the president this
year, and would wait for him to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   The store displays old campaign buttons and bumper stickers,
``Mondale and Ferraro for America,'' and campaign posters,
``Kennedy for President _ Leadership for the 60's.'' Democratic
merchandise lines one side of the store, Republican items on the
other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will point him toward the Democrat side,'' Mowery said,
adding that the president, who he referred to as the First
Customer, has a collection of political buttons. ``I am absolutely
looking forward to it.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the store had some new FDR buttons, and one from
William Jennings Bryan, that he would like to show Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   A large photograph of the president inspecting the showcase of
political buttons hangs at the entrance to the store. Clinton
visited in 1997 while shopping with his daughter, Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Camp, manager of Brookstone, a specialty gift shop, said
he was ``well-informed of the traditional visit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to meet him, even with the checkered history,''
Camp said, adding that if the president asked for recommendations,
he would point to what he called the store's ``tempurpedic
products,'' which are promoted as relieving pressure and stress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I might suggest the massage chair,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Clinton did the bulk of his shopping at a store in
the Peace Corps headquarters in downtown Washington _ a building
that Hillary Rodham Clinton dedicated in September 1998 _ before
joining Chelsea for their traditional Christmas Eve shopping
excursion at the Union Station mall. The Peace Corps store sells
merchandise from countries around the world and uses the proceeds
to support Peace Corps volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   And for the first time this year, said Nanda Chitre, a White
House spokeswoman, Clinton skipped at least one early trip to the
mall in favor of shopping online. From his antique wooden desk in
the Oval Office, he used a Compaq laptop computer adorned with the
presidential seal to order jewelry and children's books. The
president ordered horsehair bracelets from a Web site run by a
private nonprofit group that helps raise money for the people of
the Oglala Lakota Nation in southwestern South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chitre said the president's practice was to pick things up
on trips, particularly international trips, so he might already
``have a stockpile of gifts.''
</P>
<P>
   Twillman, at the pen company, with his eye on the bottom line,
did finally yield a bit on the prospect of serving the president of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would welcome him with open arms,'' he said. ``I just wish
he would come back in January.''

CUBAN BOY TO REMAIN IN  MIAMI FOR CHRISTMAS, INS SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old Cuban refugee who was
rescued from an inner tube off the Florida Coast on Thanksgiving
Day, will remain in Miami at least through Christmas, immigration
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service faxed a letter to
Spencer Eig, Elian's lawyer, saying it had postponed an inspection
interview with the boy that was originally scheduled for Thursday.
The interview is part of the agency's procedure for determining a
person's admissibility into the United States while his immigration
status is decided.
</P>
<P>
   INS Commissioner Doris Meissner will ultimately rule on whether
the boy will stay with relatives in Florida, as Cuban exiles have
demanded, or be returned to his father in Cuba, as the father and
the Cuban government have demanded.
</P>
<P>
   The letter also offered reassurances that Elian will remain with
his Miami relatives and would not be placed in foster care. In
recent days there had been worried whispers that the boy would be
either taken away from his father's Miami relatives or even
deported to Cuba this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point we did not have all the information we needed to
complete his inspection,'' said Maria Cardona, an INS spokeswoman.
``We did not think it was important for him to come and meet with
INS inspectors. A decision is not going to be forthcoming this
week.''
</P>
<P>
   Eig said, ``I am very pleased with this development because
there was a concern that Elian would be railroaded out of the
country tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pleased about this because it gives Elian an
opportunity to relax and for him to obtain due process of law. Due
process is not the fastest way to make a decision, but it is the
fairest way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration service officials said their decision to postpone
the interview did not affect the more important question of who
will speak for the boy's interests. Since arriving here after a
journey that claimed the life of his mother and 10 others, the boy
has been at the center of an international custody dispute between
his father in Cuba and relatives in Miami, both of whom insist they
are looking out for the child's best interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision we need to make is who can speak on the child's
behalf regarding the immigration issues involved in this case,''
Ms. Cardona said. ``INS's decision in this regard can be made
before, during or after the inspection is completed. The January 21
inspection date is not magical and it has no bearing on our
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the frayed relations between the United States and Cuba,
the tug of war over Elian's fate has been fraught with larger
political meaning. Exile groups in Miami have embraced the child,
with local politicians visiting his Miami hone bearing gifts and
encouragement. Elian's lawyer has filed a request for political
asylum for the schoolboy, saying he had a fear of persecution
should he be returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would not go back to the custody of his father, he would go
into the custody of Fidel Castro for the purposes of being used as
a trophy in parades all around the country as a symbol of Castro's
victory over the United States,'' Eig said. ``We pointed out to the
INS that would be particularly horrifying to Elian because he would
be turned into a symbol of the regime that drove his own mother to
her death.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the custody impasse began, throngs of protesters in Cuba
have taken to the streets nine times to demand the boy's return. In
Havana on Wednesday, protesters with flags and banners brought
traffic to a standstill as they streamed through seaside avenue by
the American Interests Section chanting ``Free Elian.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban officials have accused the exile community of using the
boy as a political pawn, wooing him with toys and attention.
President Fidel Castro has also said that if the boy is returned,
there would be no triumphant parades. One Cuban official who spoke
on the condition of anonymity said that his government wanted to
see the child come back to as normal a home environment as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has been done in Miami is part of a show that the people
are doing every day,'' said the official. ``The boy is suffering.
His mother is dead and he has to be with his father.''

PUTTING NUMBERS TO THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Last weekend, Bill Bradley took Al Gore to
task for his gradualist approach on expanding health care coverage,
asking his rival again and again: ``Who would you leave out?''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the Bradley campaign provided its own answer: Melinda
Berg of Hillsborough, Tim Chrysostum of Canterbury, and Abbi
Orenstein of Manchester. The three, according to David Cutler, a
Harvard economist advising Bradley, are among the 81,000 of New
Hampshire's 94,000 uninsured people who would remain uninsured
under Gore's health care plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't afford to wait 10 or 20 years for health care,'' said
Orenstein, 24, a temporary agency worker without insurance
coverage. ``We need health care now.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's health care plan would start by insuring all children and
their parents and then moving toward universal health care down the
road. Bradley, on the other hand, would attempt to cover most
people by providing them with subsidies to purchase private health
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   By putting faces on the abstract policy debate, the Bradley
campaign was borrowing a page from the Gore playbook. Gore's New
Hampshire office has held several press conferences around the
state this year with people who are disabled and rely on Medicaid
for their health insurance. Those people have complained
vociferously that Bradley's plan would eliminate Medicaid and
replace it with an inferior alternative.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday it was the Bradley campaign's turn to worry aloud
about Gore's plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been fairly lucky, I've been healthy,'' said Chrysostum,
a 32-year-old who works at the Canterbury Shaker Village. ``But I
can't guarantee that will always be true, and at any moment I could
be one of the large group of people who become seriously ill and
have to be rushed to an emergency room without any way to pay for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Gore campaign produced its own numbers,
contending that over 100,000 of New Hampshire's Medicaid recipients
would be left in the lurch under Bradley's plan, and over 160,000
seniors on Medicare here would be made vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are tired of politicians making promises they don't
keep and Bradley's plan is one big promise he can't keep,'' said
Douglas Hattaway, Gore's spokesman here. ``Al Gore supports
universal health care but he's not promising that this problem can
be solved in one fell swoop.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While campaigning at West High School this week, Texas Governor
George W. Bush was asked about a federal report that said his state
was the second worst in the country for the percentage of hungry
households. Bush said he did not believe that five percent of Texas
children are suffering from hunger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I'm surprised a report floats out of Washington when I'm
running a presidential campaign,'' he said. ``It seems like a lot
of reports are floating out of Washington. You'd think the governor
would have heard if there are pockets of hunger in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that the embarassing report was spawned by the
Federal Food Security Measurement Project with the charge to
collect data annually to determine the amount of hunger in America.
And the president who signed the law that created the project that
churned out the report was none other than the candidate's father,
former President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Voters won't have long to wait before the first presidential
debates of the new millenium on January 5th and 6th. In keeping
with the new century, people can watch the debates on a live web
simulcast and answer questions from an online poll at
www.wiredvote.com, a new site sponsored by a variety of New
Hampshire corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore and Bill Bradley will participate in the Jan. 5 debate,
moderated by ABC's Peter Jennings. And the Republican candidates
will participate in the Jan. 6 debate, moderated by NBC's Tim
Russert. Both one-hour debates will be held at 7 p.m. at the
University of New Hampshire and broadcast by New Hampshire Public
Television, C-Span, New Hampshire Public Radio and a variety of ABC
and PBS stations across the country.

LENGTHY US-CANADA BORDER REPLETE WITH LEAKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forest City, Maine, with its winter population of five, is
hardly a hot spot for illegal immigration from Canada. So trusting
are Immigration and Naturalization Service officials that,
normally, only a surveillance camera guards the border crossing
after the federal agent goes home for the day.
</P>
<P>
   But a lot has changed this week.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since the Persian Gulf War in 1991, US border
officials have been put on a heightened state of alert, and they
are particularly concerned about the 798-mile stretch of the border
along New England. Not only is the rural, wooded border lightly
guarded, but it is near the major Canadian cities of Montreal and
Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, smugglers of everything from cigarettes to
illegal aliens have found the New England border an easy target.
But the arrests this week in Vermont of two people amid speculation
they may be involved in terrorism has cast the smuggling issue in a
more sinister light.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned about the border out here. I'm wondering if it's
possible for (terrorists) to go across because it is such a remote
area. It would be an easy job at night,'' said Donna Gilman,
postmaster in Brookton, which provides mail to Forest City. ``It
gives me pause.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Immigration and Naturalization Service say they
have ratcheted up security along the 5,500-mile US-Canadian border
more as a precaution than in response to a specific threat.
Christmas vacations for Border Patrol agents are being cancelled,
and staff increased so that no one works alone and all official
border checkpoints, including tiny Forest City, have 24-hour
staffing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be on the safe side,'' said Raymond Kelly, director
of the US Customs Service, which manages border checkpoints along
with INS. ``It's prudent. It's not in response to any specific
threat. We just think it's wise to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   But, with only 107 Border Patrol agents assigned to guard the
entire region, some federal law enforcement officials believe more
are needed to pose a real threat to border jumpers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone wants to carry out an intelligent plan to cross the
border undetected, I'd say the chances of them getting through are
pretty good,'' said Jay McCloskey, the U.S. Attorney for Maine, who
has prosecuted numerous immigration cases during a 20-year-career.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's arrest of Bouabide Chamchi, an Algerian, along with
Canadian Lucia Garofalo, at the border crossing in Beecher Falls in
northeastern Vermont came very close to home for some people.
Coupled with the earlier arrest of an Algerian Ahmed Ressam in
Washington on charges of trying to smuggle bomb-making supplies
into the country, it put a threatening new focus on the world's
longest open border.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that some of these entry locations may have been
identified by terrorist groups and we've cancelled all annual
leave,'' said Roland Richardson, deputy chief with the US Border
Patrol in Houlton, Maine. ``All of our agents are on the job and
happy to be there given the possibility of entries that could be
coming through here.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the US-Canada border, unlike the US border with
Mexico, was never designed to be leak-proof. Families live on both
sides of the border in communities such as Calais, Maine, and St.
Stephen, New Brunswick, while part of the library in Derby, Vt., is
actually in Canada. For these communities, frequent border
crossings are a way of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``People might cross the border three times a day coming to the
store, going to visit grandma or whatever,'' said Jean Ouellette,
deputy director of the Immigration and Natural Service regional
office in Portland, Maine, noting these people tend to support
measures making border crossing easier.
</P>
<P>
   Ouellette estimates that one-third of the 15 million people who
enter New England from Canada each year come through just three
stations, including Calais. Some of the 36 other official border
crossings in the region, such as Pittsburg, N.H., receive fewer
than 100 border crossings a day.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, for long stretches of the 600-mile Maine border
with Canada, only unguarded logging roads connect the two
countries. In such rural areas, border crossers are either subject
to video surveillance or directed by a sign to check in at the
nearest staffed border crossing.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, New England's frontier has sometimes been
targeted by smugglers of both humans and material goods. Slightly
west of New England, the most notorious smuggling route is the
Akwesasne Mohawk Reserve between New York State and Ontario, near
Quebec. Illegal immigrants pay Indian guides to bring them to the
United States side every year, counting on Canadian and American
reluctance to crack down on an Indian reserve.
</P>
<P>
   However, Marcus Russell at the Immigration and Naturalization
Service in Houlton, Maine, estimates that less than one-tenth of
one percent of the 15 million people who come from Canada into New
England each year are attempting to do something illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Border Patrol agents detained just 3,025 people in the
last fiscal year in New England and eastern New York, a tiny
fraction of those arrested entering the United States from Mexico.
Some say the low numbers reflect the fact that the Border Patrol
has just 107 agents to patrol almost 1,000 miles of border, but
federal officials say sensors and video cameras hidden in the woods
increase the reach of their force.
</P>
<P>
   Along the border Wednesday, some residents accepted federal
reassurances, noting that many of these border regions are so tight
knit that strangers stand out.
</P>
<P>
   ``People know everybody here . . . Even if you cross in the
middle of a field here, someone's going to see you and you'll get
caught.'' John Martin of Richford, Vt.

CLINTON URGES CAUTION IN WAKE OF TERRORISM FEARS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton led a chorus of federal officials
Wednesday in encouraging Americans to celebrate the holiday season
but to be extra cautious amid fears of year 2000-related terrorism
at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would ask them (Americans) to just be aware of their
circumstances and if they see anything suspicious to report it
immediately,'' Clinton said during a visit to a Washington soup
kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   The president said U.S. law enforcement agencies are ``taking
extraordinary efforts'' to thwart potential terrorism after the
arrest last week of a suspected terrorist in Washington state.
These steps include increasing the number of security personnel and
enhancing safety operations at U.S. airports, borders and docks.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   In Houston, as in other coastal U.S. cities, security will be
beefed up at the port. Also, Bush Intercontinental Airport, like
other facilities around the country, will have more uniformed
police and bomb-sniffing dogs on patrol, federal officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard and Customs Service have also increased staffing
in the Houston area, and the Port of Houston authority has
instructed its police to be on a ``heightened state of awareness,''
authority spokeswoman Esther De Ipolyi said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Senior Justice and Defense department officials joined Clinton's
call for cautious celebration between now and mid-January, saying
their agencies are working around the clock to uncover potential
terrorist threats before they can occur.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's comments came just hours before an
Algerian national pleaded innocent to charges related to his
alleged smuggling of bomb-making equipment into the United States.
The Dec. 14 arrest of Ahmed Ressam in Port Angeles, Wash.,
heightened federal and public concern that terrorists might strike
during the holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and Canadian officials are searching for three men
suspected of working with Ressam, The Associated Press reported.
Ressam, when arrested by the Customs Service, had enough
nitroglycerin and bomb-making materials in his car to bring down a
large building, law enforcement officials said.
</P>
<P>
   He could face up to 40 years in prison if convicted in a Seattle
federal court of all five charges on which he was indicted
Wednesday. The charges include smuggling bomb-making equipment,
transporting explosives, possessing unregistered firearms, carrying
explosives during a felony and lying to Customs Service officials.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. law enforcement officials suspect Ressam, 32, might be
linked to an Islamic fundamentalist group, based on unconfirmed
intelligence data, The New York Times reported Wednesday. The
newspaper also cited French officials as saying Ressam might have
links to an Algerian terrorist group that set off bombs in France
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But even before Ressam's capture, U.S. law enforcement was
already on increased alert to potential terrorism due to concern
that terrorists might strike at U.S. interests at the dawn of 2000,
federal officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder Jr. called a news conference
Wednesday to assuage public concerns about possible terrorism. He
said the government has received no specific threats of planned
terrorist attacks against specific U.S. targets.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Holder urged Americans to be on guard if they
attend crowded new year celebrations scheduled across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask people to be more cautious, more vigilant, more aware of
their surroundings,'' said Holder, the Justice Department's No. 2
official. But Holder downplayed growing public concern of potential
holiday terrorism, saying he ``would encourage people'' to attend
large outdoor celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not want to unnecessarily alarm people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant FBI Director Dale Watson, who heads the bureau's
counterterrorism division, said law enforcement agents are on ``a
heightened state of alert.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson, who joined Holder at the news conference, said the FBI
was reacting to no specific threat of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   As for threats abroad, Defense Secretary William Cohen said U.S.
intelligence agencies are ``cooperating worldwide with their
counterparts'' to uncover any planned terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a sharing of intelligence to make sure that we have
the latest possible information to make sure that we can deter and
detect and discourage any attempts on American lives anywhere in
the world,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the State Department late Tuesday night issued its
second travelers' warning in 11 days alerting Americans to the
possibility of terrorism abroad following the arrest of militants
in Jordan last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot rule out the possibility that attacks still may be
planned for this and other parts of the world,'' the department
said.
</P>
<P>
   The recent travel advisory followed the Jordanian capture last
week of 13 members of Osama bin Laden's terrorist group. The
terrorists said they were planning attacks against U.S. and Israeli
interests, Jordanian officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States suspects bin Laden, an exiled Saudi, of
masterminding the bombing last year of two U.S. embassies in East
Africa, which killed more than 250 people and injured more than
5,000 others. Bin Laden has made general threats of terrorism
against the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The terrorism concern also prompted federal and local police in
Washington, D.C., to search in vain Wednesday for a blue van, with
Texas license plates, that someone reported as looking suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, U.S. Customs Service agents in the Bahamas
detained an American who was acting suspiciously and was found
carrying wires and magnetic coils. FBI officials questioned him in
Nassau, but a thorough search of the suspect uncovered nothing more
alarming, the State Department reported.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL; 
A U.S. Customs spokesman in Washington said the man was wanted in
Texas but would not disclose the details of that case.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Also, federal officials Monday caught a second Algerian national
trying to sneak into the United States. Border Patrol agents in
Beecher Falls, Vt., captured Bouabide Chamchi, who was allegedly
carrying a fake passport.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials are investigating whether Chamchi and Ressam
are connected and whether either is linked to a terrorist
organization.

   CARACAS, Venezuela _ On Tuesday, Alirio Luque Diaz watched as
the body of his 5-year-old son, Yoel, was pulled from a pile of
rubble here and quickly interred in a mass grave. Wednesday he
stood dazed as rescue workers searched for his wife, Yaname, who
was 8 1-2 months pregnant when an avalanche of mud and rock
engulfed the family's small house on a mountainside here late last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've lost everything, even the will to live,'' said Luque, a
33-year-old electrician. ``But I want them to find her body so that
I can say goodbye to her and then leave here and never, never have
to see this place again.''
</P>
<P>
   As Venezuela struggles to recover from its worst natural
disaster of modern times, brought on by three days of torrential
rain that set off vast landslides and flooding, the suffering and
the death toll continue to mount.
</P>
<P>
   And here in the capital, no neighborhood has been harder hit
than Blandin, a squatter settlement perched precariously on a
hillside below a main highway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably should never have built houses along this ravine,
but when you are poor, you learn to be thankful for whatever you
can get,'' said Franklin Figuera, a 57-year-old chauffeur who has
lived in the area his whole life and saw both his own house and his
elderly mother's destroyed. ``We got away with it for a long time,
but now nature has returned to reclaim what is hers.''
</P>
<P>
   The devastation along Venezuela's northern Caribbean coast is so
widespread that a week after the rains began, authorities are still
having difficulty quantifying it. With more than 150,000 people
driven from their homes and confusion about the whereabouts of
many, estimates of the number of deaths range from 500 to 25,000.
</P>
<P>
   In Blandin, the task of recovering bodies and determining the
death toll has fallen to the same Caracas fire department unit that
found the bodies of Luque's son and a still unidentified adult on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In carrying out that job, the team is guided as much by the
stench of death, so powerful that it penetrates even sanitary
masks, as by the urging of residents who want them to excavate the
houses of neighbors who are missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are recovering hardly any whole corpses,'' said Capt.
Vicente Campos Ron, the head of the search squad. ``What we are
finding is a head here, an arm or a leg there, which makes it hard
to identify the bodies or calculate how many people have actually
died in this catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
   Campos said his men have recovered 32 bodies in Blandin so far.
But Solaine Diaz, a relief worker from the mayor's office,
estimated the death toll in the neighborhood at ``about 140,''
while Marlene Montero, leader of a community association, said she
feared 3,000 people have died.
</P>
<P>
   Relief workers have begun a census, but that process has been
slowed by continued bad weather, including a relatively light but
steady rain throughout the day Wednesday that may have contributed
to a helicopter crash that killed eight people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want our people getting caught in one of the little
landslides that are still occurring and then have to add them to
the casualty list,'' Ms. Diaz said.
</P>
<P>
   But when one worker called this morning on Wilton Pilligua, a
29-year-old bricklayer, Pilligua took a break from removing his
belongings from the remains of his house. The bodies of two of his
nephews, 9-year-old Kelvin and 4-year-old Estefan, have been
recovered, but his sister Irma, the boys' mother, is still missing,
and Pilligua handed over a photograph of her in hopes it can be
matched with a recovered corpse.
</P>
<P>
   As Pilligua looked through the family photo album, a friend
rushed in to tell him that someone had just made off with the
television set he had left at a nearby street corner. At that news,
Pilligua's wife, Mercedes, whose grandfather and two cousins are
missing, burst into tears and went off to try to protect the
couple's few remaining possessions.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuelans have been living with this disaster since Dec. 15,
the day they went to the polls and overwhelmingly approved a new
constitution that expands the powers of President Hugo Chavez and
his military allies. It rained heavily all that day; early the next
day, as many of Blandin's residents were asleep, the first
avalanche struck.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had minor flooding before, but this all happened very
quickly,'' said Jhonny Villegas, 28, a laborer. ``The mountain
began to shake and tremble, there was this terrible noise, and then
all of a sudden a gigantic wave of mud and debris was upon us and
we could do nothing but scramble up the side of the mountain and
pray that we would be spared.''
</P>
<P>
   The force of the initial landslide, which survivors describe as
being more than 20 feet high, swept away everything as it descended
the mountain, picking up speed and mass as it advanced. Wednesday
tree trunks, refrigerators, automobiles, even a passenger bus
remained half embedded in the fetid mud that has accumulated at the
bottom of a ravine.
</P>
<P>
   ``That boulder wasn't there before,'' said Figuera, pointing to
a rock formation the size of a house sitting in the middle of what
had been a street but is now a stream littered with clothing,
furniture, household appliances and Christmas decorations. ``God
only knows where it came from.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Authorities are now demanding that residents leave Blandin,
citing the lack of water and electricity, and the danger of more
landslides and disease.
</P>
<P>
   Though Fairee Hernandez, the only nurse working in the
neighborhood, warns of ``an epidemic of rabies'' and says she has
also diagnosed hepatitis and diarrhea, many survivors refuse to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to take care of this house because our family has
nothing else left and no other place to go,'' said Francisco
Portillo, 69, a mechanic who has taken in all his homeless in-laws
and their children. ``We can't leave here because robbers would
come and steal what little we have left, as they have already done
in the houses that have been abandoned.''
</P>
<P>
   This morning a military unit with a loudspeaker came through,
warning that anyone refusing to leave would be removed by force. To
step up the pressure, residents complain, people who leave Blandin
in search of food or water are being prevented from returning at
checkpoints the army and National Guard have set up.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to resettle us way off in the Amazon or the plains
because they say there is housing and plenty of land there,''
Wilmer Rodriguez, a 23-year-old student and warehouse employee said
dismissively. ``But there aren't any jobs in those places, so why
would we want to leave Caracas to go there?''
</P>
<P>
   But Carmen del Prado said she wanted to get her family out as
soon as she could. She is having trouble sleeping, she said,
because every time it begins to rain she fears the mountain will
come crashing down on her again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The smell of the dead is so dreadful, and I spend every waking
moment in anguish over the destruction of this community,'' she
said. ``What has happened can be told, but it cannot be believed.
It's all over for us here. There is nothing left, not even
memories.''

MILLOY'S FUTURE UP IN THE AIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ Lawyer Milloy, the only Patriots player to be named
to the AFC Pro Bowl starting team Wednesday, has dropped more than
a few hints that he may want to play football elsewhere next
season.
</P>
<P>
   One problem: The Patriots might not make it easy for him to walk
away.
</P>
<P>
   Milloy, who will be an unrestricted free agent at season's end,
was quite down Wednesday about the team's failure to make the
playoffs for the first time since being selected in the second
round out of Washington in 1996. Asked if he was returning to the
Patriots, Milloy said, ``I can't answer that question.''
</P>
<P>
   Milloy's comments about his Pro Bowl honor belied his feelings
about the status of the team: ``I'm tired of walking around like a
zombie,'' said Milloy. ``Not being able to vie for a championship
is very disappointing. We have so much talent on this team that to
be out of it . . . I'm disappointed. I'm team-oriented and I get
individual accolades through team success. . . . It's an individual
achievement. There's definite gratification for me and my family.
But when the team isn't involved, it doesn't mean as much to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Milloy and the Patriots negotiated during the bye week in
November and came to a philosophical understanding of where Milloy
would fit. Milloy also met with owner Robert Kraft and came away
feeling positive about a deal. No dollars were offered, but
Milloy's representatives made it clear that Milloy, now a two-time
Pro Bowler, would be the league's highest-paid safety, which meant
a six- or seven-year deal worth about $30 million-$35 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots, however, have the option of slapping a franchise
tag on Milloy, which means he would play for the team at the
average salary of the top five players at that position. Milloy, of
course, could still go elsewhere, but as a franchise player, his
new team would have to give the Patriots two No. 1 draft picks.
</P>
<P>
   Safeties aren't generally franchised, and the Patriots have
never franchised a player. They came close to doing it with Willie
McGinest last year, but in the end McGinest got his five-year deal
worth $25 million, including an $8 million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots vice president Andy Wasynczuk detests the franchise tag
and has avoided it all costs. Wednesday he hesitated but used it in
Milloy's case, feeling that he and Milloy's agent, Ray Anderson,
have negotiated in good faith and thinks there's no reason the
sides can't work something out.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of time for Ray and I to talk,'' said Wasynczuk.
``We'd made very good progress and we decided to pick it up at the
end of the season. We'll stick to that.''
</P>
<P>
   The league and the NFL Players Association have extended the
period a team has exclusive time to sign its own unrestricted free
agents. It used to be two weeks after the Super Bowl, but now it
will be March 1 before players can pursue other employment.
</P>
<P>
   The downside of franchising Milloy would be that he would likely
hold out if he was that unhappy, as did Seattle receiver Joey
Galloway and Cincinnati receiver Carl Pickens the last two years.
Milloy hasn't said he'll do that, either. But right now he's not in
a great state of mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be truthfully honest, I don't know what's going to happen
after this year,'' he said. ``Individually, I know that based on my
performance, I'm going to make a little more money than before.
That's certain being here or someplace else. I owe this
organization my exisiting contract. I owe my teammates two more
games and they're going to get my all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty much finished. Everything is gonna affect it. I'll
weight out every scenario. I'll put myself in position to win a
championship. I'm going to lay out every possible scenario. If you
know me, it doesn't matter how much money I make. I'd be miserable
if I don't win. You can get paid a lot of money and not be happy,''
said Milloy, dropping another hint.
</P>
<P>
   He was quick to add that looking around the room he wasn't the
only player who might be with another team next year, which worries
him about where the team might be going.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the only player in this situation,'' he said. ``One of
the players I respect so much a player who plays like me, but he's
on the other side of the ball is Troy Brown, and there's Shawn
Jefferson and Steve Israel . . . This team could drastically
change. That's why you have that zombie effect around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, he doesn't believe the Patriots belong watching the
playoffs. ``There's so much talent, that's the other reason it's so
frustrating,'' he said. ``Take nothing away from Cleveland and
Philly and Cincinnati, but we have the talent. We should have
beaten those teams.''
</P>
<P>
   He will get his happiness this Christmas, not necessarily from
the Pro Bowl berth, but more so from his daughter, who will visit
from the Seattle area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing some shopping, putting together a turkey, wrapping
presents by myself, and putting a Christmas tree up,'' he said.
``I'm looking forward to that. I'm trying to channel my negative
energy to her. You need family in your spare time. She always gives
me a smile, which is important to me because I'm not the best
person to be around when we're losing.''
</P>
<P>
   While some players and Pete Carroll speak of salvaging something
the rest of the season, Milloy already feels all is lost. He
doesn't believe anyone can save themselves in the next two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too late for that,'' said Milloy. ``I've already told you
guys that just because you do something the final two weeks that
doesn't make up for messing up.''

LEADS IN TERRORISM THREAT LINKED TO BOSTON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY AND JUDY RAKOWSKY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ US authorities were tracking leads from around the
world Wednesday amid worries over end-of-the-year terror attacks
following the arrests in Vermont and Washington state of two
Algerian men, one of whom sought to enter the United States with
bomb-making materials.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle Wednesday, a federal grand jury indicted Ahmed
Ressam, 32, who was charged with transporting explosives,
possessing unregistered firearms, smuggling nitroglycerin, and
giving false information to border guards.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the new leads, US officials said, were linked to New
England, specifically the Boston area. In addition, there was
generalized concern about higher risk in New England because of the
ease in slipping across the porous US-Canada border.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, seeking to awaken Americans to the threat of
terrorist attacks in the coming days and weeks, asked the public to
be watchful for any suspicious activity _ and if witnessed, to
contact police. Still, he said that Americans should not ``stop
their holiday activities. I think they ought to go and enjoy the
season.''
</P>
<P>
   In New England, one investigation focused on a Montreal woman,
arrested Sunday with Algerian native Bouabide Chamchi at the remote
Beecher Falls, Vt., crossing. She successfully crossed the
US-Canada border earlier in December with two Algerian nationals,
telling border officials her destination was Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators were also seeking three men in connection with a
bombing plot in Jordan, one of whom was last known to live at 15
Appleton St. in Everett, Mass. and has a Massachusetts driving
license. He was identified by law enforcement sources as Raed
Hajazi, 21.
</P>
<P>
   In the White House and at the State Department, Defense
Department, and other national security agencies, debate flourished
for the third consecutive day on how best to alert the public to
the threats while trying not to ruin the holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Said one US official who attended several of the high-level
meetings: ``The problem is, how do you make people concerned but
not send them running to the bomb shelters?''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, after visiting a Washington soup kitchen, said, ``For
all citizens, I would say they ought to go about their holidays and
enjoy themselves and make the most of it. But I would ask them to
just be aware of their circumstances and, if they see anything
suspicious, to report it immediately, and meanwhile to know that we
are doing everything we possibly can.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the government was making ``extraordinary efforts . . .
based on the incident out in the Pacific Northwest and what we
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities, however, still had not made any definitive
connection between the Algerian-born Ressem and Osama bin Laden, a
wealthy Saudi Arabian sought by the United States for masterminding
the 1998 US embassy bombings in Africa. There is a widespread
assumption among intelligence officials that Ressem has ties to bin
Laden associates, likely during time he spent in France three years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Carefully choosing his words at a news conference, Deputy
Attorney General Eric Holder assessed the threat of a terrorist
attack: ``We do not have any specific information about particular
targets.''
</P>
<P>
   US officials said Holder, and other top US officials, had agreed
to stick to the phrases ``specific information'' and ``particular
targets'' because they were technically true and also useful in
alleviating fears. US intelligence officials, though, had amassed
several leads on general threats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we have general reporting that concerns us? Absolutely,''
said an administration official, speaking on condition of
anonymity. ``That's why we have have taken steps to raise the alert
status on the borders and issued the two warnings'' for Americans
living or travelling overseas.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department issued a second warning late Tuesday that
said, ``The US government believes that terrorists may be planning
to conduct attacks including against official and non-official
Americans, in and around the New Year period (from now through
mid-January 2000) with particular emphasis on locations where large
groups of people may congregate for millennial or religious
festivities.''
</P>
<P>
   US officials believe that if a terrorist group decides to attack
Americans it could happen anywhere in the world, and it could
happen in coordinated fashion in multiple locations. In August
1998, bin Laden's organization was believed responsible for two
almost simultaneous attacks on US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania
that killed more than 200 people.
</P>
<P>
   If terrorist attacks were to happen in the United States, the
most vulnerable places may be New England, New York City and parts
of the West Coast, US officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very concerned the Osama bin Laden group has cells set
up in New York, a little on the West Coast, and in quieter areas of
the upper East Coast, such as Connecticut, Massachusetts, New
Hampshire, Vermont and Maine,'' said a second US official, speaking
on condition of anonymity and refusing to give further details.
``The reason we're so concerned about New England is that there has
been so little attention paid in the past to the border crossings
up there.'' Those border crossings have been substantially
tightened in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, another US official said he believed the government
warnings made it safer for people to attend public gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about specific information on threats in New England, the
official said, ``Anyone who was not taking these threats seriously
is taking it seriously now. It's going to be important for First
Night in Boston, and all the other First Nights going on around New
England, that people are vigilant. In the end, that benefits
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli expert on terrorism, Boaz Ganor, said the arrests of
the two Algerian men _ if either or both are linked to terrorist
plans _ may break up a ring of terrorists. ``There is going to be
concern about what those people say in custody,'' Ganor said.
</P>
<P>
   But Neil Livingstone, chairman of GlobalOptions, a security and
crisis management company in Washington, said he believed the
arrests represented only the ``tip of the iceberg'' of terrorists'
plans.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted 10 to 15 terrorist attacks globally around the turn
of the millennium, possibly coming from several groups ``because
terrorists know that by marking the millennium with whatever they
do, they will be immortalized.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingstone and several US officials noted that the threat
worldwide was perhaps greatest in Jordan and Israel, where
authorities expect upward of 1.5 million tourists to descend on the
tiny state in the holiday season. Also vulnerable are US troops
stationed in Bosnia because of lax security around the borders, US
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But Livingstone said from a terrorist's perspective, the biggest
target remains the United States. ``If you can score the United
States, that's like getting center on the bull's eye,'' he said.

CANADA MOVES TO TIGHTEN SECURITY ALONG BORDER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ A Montreal woman arrested at a remote border crossing
in Vermont Sunday had made at least one earlier trip to New England
in recent days, raising fears that she may have already delivered
explosives or terrorist operatives, sources in the United States
and Canada said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Canada, meanwhile, moved to tighten security amid reports of
terrorist groups operating within its borders. The move came after
an unusual joint announcement by US Attorney General Janet Reno and
Canadian Solicitor General Lawrence MacAulay that the ``two
countries are working together to to deal with any potential threat
to security of citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators increasingly believe Montreal may be the key point
of connection in a radical Islamic terrorist conspiracy targeting
the United States. All of the three individuals arrested in Vermont
and Washington state have close ties to an ``Algerian underground''
in Canada's second-largest city.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent arrests came when Lucia Garofalo _ a 35-year-old
Quebecer with marriage ties to the Middle East _ was taken into
custody in Beecher Falls, Vt., after sniffer dogs trained to detect
bombmaking materials found trace amounts of explosives in her
Chrysler Neon. Accompanying Garofalo, and also still being held in
federal custody in Burlington, Vt., was Bouabide Chamchi, a
20-year-old Algerian living in Montreal, who was allegedly in
possession of an altered French passport.
</P>
<P>
   Like Ahmed Ressem, 32 _ the Algerian arrested in Washington
state last week with a carload of bombmaking gear _ Chamchi has
links to a Montreal-based ring of Algerian car thieves and break-in
artists whose criminal activities, police believe, are a way of
raising funds for terrorism abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Garofalo and Chamchi have only been charged with immigration
violations, including possession of a falsified French passport.
</P>
<P>
   However, Ressem was indicted by a federal grand jury in Seattle
Wednesday in connection with his Dec. 14 attempt to smuggle
nitroglycerine, timing devices and explosives material into the
United States from British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Ressem made his home in Montreal. News reports have linked him
to radical Islamic training camps in the Middle East. He has also
been linked to Algerian groups in France who use bank robbery and
other crimes to raise funds, a pattern similar to the groups with
which he may have been involved in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities on both sides of the border are especially alarmed
that on Dec. 6 Garofalo and an Algerian male _ tentatively
identified as Mustafa Roubici of Montreal _ crossed from Canada in
the same car in which she and Chamchi were apprehended on the later
trip. She crossed back into Canada on Dec. 12.
</P>
<P>
   In her successful entry to the United States, as as well as an
attempt on Dec. 15 in which she raised the suspicions of US border
authorities and was turned back, Garofalo went to extremely remote
border posts in Vermont and New Hampshire, none of them on a direct
route from Montreal to Boston, where she claimed to be headed. On
each occasion she was accompanied by different men of Middle
Eastern origin.
</P>
<P>
   The worst fear of investigators, although it remains only a
theory, is that on an earlier trip the car may have succesfully
carried bomb materials or terrorist operatives into the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's scarier than a carload of explosives?'' said an
investigator in Canada, answering his own rhetorical question: ``A
car with explosives residue that may have already made a successful
delivery somewhere. That's the very worst-case scenario.''
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement sources stressed, however, that the trace
amounts of explosives detected in her car could have an innocent
explanation _ such as the earlier transport of hunting weapons or
ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   A massive cross-border investigation into Garofalo, Chamchi,
Ressam, and other Montreal-based Islamic radicals continued as
federal, provincial and local police tried to piece together her
movements in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Little is known about Garofalo. According to a US official, her
husband is an Algerian recently deported from Canada who presently
resides in Europe. She may also have family ties to Libya,
according US prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 6, she and two male passengers entered the US through a
border crossing near Pittsburg, N.H., guarded only by a
surveillance camera and two-way speakers. A US immigration official
questioned her via the speaker but did not require the three
travelers to report to the nearest manned border post to show
identification.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 12, she returned to Canada at Stanstead, Quebec,
accompanied by the man identified as Roubici. Although he carried
no travel documents, he told Canadian authorities he was an
Algerian living in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   He was permitted to enter Canada, although officials there
reported his movement to US immigration officials since he appeared
to have been in the United States illegally.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 15, Garofalo attempted to enter the United States at
Pittsburg again. She was accompanied by a man who identified
himself as Ahmed Saheen of Pakistan. Because of the odd time, 2:35
a.m. and her curious route from Montreal, the US border inspector
grilled her more closely over the speaker system, and instructed
her to open the trunk of the vehicle. The surveillance camera
showed it to be full of boxes and luggage. She was instructed to
come around to a manned border station, but instead, law
enforcement officials say, she drove back to Canada.
</P>
<P>
   On all occasions, Garofalo said her destination was Boston.
</P>
<P>
   One law enforcment source speculated that Garofalo may work as a
``mule'' carrying illegal immigrants from the Middle East into the
United States, and may have no specific knowledge of their plans or
what they have in their possession.
</P>
<P>
   The Algerian facing charges in Seattle, Ressam, is suspected of
being an operative for a loose group of Islamic radicals with
connections to Canada and France. He had lived in Montreal after
applying for refugee status upon arriving in Canada from France in
February 1994. He claimed that the Algerian military had
``unjustly'' accused him of ``arms dealing'' on behalf of Islamic
radicals, according to Canadian news reports.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact he arrived carrying a fake French passport and
other falsified documents, Ressam was allowed to remain in Canada
with no restrictions other than a requirement that he check in
monthly with immigration authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials have not established a clear
connection between Ressam and Garofalo or Chamchi, the pair
arrested in Vermont. But sources said all three have strong links
to an underground of Algerian radicals residing in Montreal and
involved in criminal enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam was arrested on at least three occasions and convicted
once on charges of breaking into motor vehicles and stealing items
such as computers and cellphones. Chamchi has been charged at least
twice with stealing cars and breaking into motor vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Such crimes are the trademark of an Montreal-based Algerian
group, with links to France, suspected of using car theft and
extortion to raise money for ``financing terrorism,'' said a
Canadian intelligence official.
</P>
<P>
   According to authorities, Chamchi was in possession of an
``altered'' French passport in the name of Boudjemaa Ben Ali when
arrested in Vermont _ much as Ressam had carried false French
papers on his original entry to Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Chamchi and Garofalo told US officials that they drove
accidentally into Vermont while ``looking for a retaurant,''
according to federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   Canada Wednesday bowed to intense pressure from the United
States and critics at home to intensify anti-terrorist security at
airports and other entry points. The precautions include a
beefed-up guard by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police outside the US
Embassy in Ottawa. Closer checks of people entering Canada from
overseas were also being made at airports.

<P>
   Bell Atlantic Corp. became Wednesday the first Baby Bell local
telephone carrier to gain federal approval to offer long-distance
service.
</P>
<P>
   After getting the go-ahead to enter the long-distance market in
New York, the company now will seek federal permission by the
middle of next year to offer the same service in Massachusetts,
followed by Pennsylvania and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   In a landmark decision that launches a new era of competition,
the Federal Communications Commission Wednesday said the nation's
second-largest local phone company can offer the same wide range of
voice and advanced data communications in New York that AT&AMP;T Corp.,
MCI Worldcom Inc. and other long-distance carriers provide. These
companies are expected to mount a vigorous defense in the
marketplace against Bell Atlantic's attempts to capture
long-distance residential and business customers in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC approval, which was expected, puts the Baby Bells back
into the lucrative $100 billion-a-year long-distance market, an
arena the Bells had been barred from since they were spun out from
AT&AMP;T Corp. in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FCC's actions in New York is the most important
telecommunications decision of this decade. This is the now the
beginning of the end of local monopolies across America,'' said US
Representative Edward J. Markey, a Democrat from Malden, Mass., who
is the ranking Democrat on the House telecommunications, trade and
consumer protection subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it is possible for Massachusetts and other states to get
in line. I think this decision is to telecommunications what the
collapse of the Berlin Wall was to freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   For consumers, more competition promises choice, better prices,
new services and the end of local phone monopolies _ the central
premise of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. The law specified
the market-opening steps that regional Bell companies were required
to make before they could enter the long-distance business.
</P>
<P>
   Until Wednesday, the FCC had denied five long-distance
applications by regional Bell companies. The FCC, in its decision,
said Bell Atlantic can begin offering service in New York early
next year, and the company set Jan. 5 as its kickoff date.
</P>
<P>
   ``The road to this moment has not been easy,'' said FCC chairman
William Kennard.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was pleased with Bell Atlantic's long-distance
entry into New York. AT&AMP;T said it is considering legal actions
challenging the FCC's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``While Bell Atlantic has made real progress in New York, its
application still falls well short of the law's requirement in at
least two areas critical to competition,'' said AT&AMP;T general
counsel Jim Cicconi, in a statement. One of those areas concerns
how quickly and smoothly orders from customers switching from Bell
Atlantic to another long-distance carrier are handled.
</P>
<P>
   MCI, by contrast, said it was looking forward to battling Bell
Atlantic in New York's highly competitive long-distance market.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Ivan Seidenberg, Bell Atlantic's chairman, said his
company expects to seek FCC approval during the first half of 2000
to offer long-distance service in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will build on this (New York) success as quickly as
possible,'' said Seidenberg, noting that Massachusetts is the next
state where Bell Atlantic will seek FCC approval, followed by
Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The New York phone giant serves 13
states from Maine to Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, SBC Communications Inc., the San Antonio-based phone
giant, said it plans to file its application to offer long-distance
service in Texas with the FCC in early January.
</P>
<P>
   Since September, Bell Atlantic has been testing its Bay State
computer and communications systems to meet a 14-point checklist
required for FCC approval. A key test requires Bell Atlantic to
quickly switch customers to a competitor upon the customer's
request. That means making sure telephone records, phone lines and
billing information are shifted smoothly through a computerized
operational support system.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, as in Massachusetts, this testing is overseen by
KPMG Worldwide, the giant accounting and consulting firm. In a
process involving parallel federal and state approvals, KPMG is
expected to complete its testing for the Bay State's Department of
Telecommunications and Energy in late March. On Tuesday, the DTE
completed a series of regulatory hearings on Bell Atlantic's
long-distance plans.
</P>
<P>
   DTE commmissioner Paul B. Vasington Wednesday said that the
commission could give its recommendation in June if Bell Atlantic
meets regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>
   He said Bell Atlantic then would file an application with the
FCC (the document was 88,500 pages long for New York) detailing how
it opened its local markets to competition and complied with the
Telecommunications Act of 1996. The DTE also would write a report,
based on the KPMG findings. Both documents then would be sent to
the FCC, which has 90 days to make its decision.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, AT&AMP;T and MCI are watching how Bay State regulators
handle Bell Atlantic's long-distance application, MCI claims the
local phone company is not far along in its testing yet. ``We're
watching them very closely,'' said spokeswoman Elena French.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T plans to offer local telephone service via cable when its
proposed acquisition of cable television giant MediaOne Group is
completed next year. Unlike New York, where AT&AMP;T has hardly any
cable ownership, MediaOne controls about 60 percent of the state's
cable TV industry with more than 1 million customers.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic shares were down 1 1/16 to close at 64 1/2
Wednesday.

PROTECTION PLAN COMMENT PERIOD AT END, FOREST SERVICE SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT BRAILE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A New Hampshire logger calls it ``totally ridiculous'' and a
Republican presidential candidate calls it ``the epitome of federal
arrogance,'' but the US Forest Service is rebuffing intense
pressure to back down from President Clinton's directive to protect
40 million acres of land in the national forests.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving more than one million letters, postcards, and
other responses since October, the service will end its public
comment period Thursday on the directive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to buckle,'' said Agriculture Department
Undersecretary Jim Lyons, in an interview Wednesday. ``We're
determined to complete this initiative as directed by the
president.'' In his view, he said, some of the criticism from
Capitol Hill has been ``disingenuous'' and intended ``to create
delay.'' He said the department rejected requests by critics to
extend the comment period by three months.
</P>
<P>
   To Rick Lessard, the owner of North Country Lumber in Freedom,
N.H. and a veteran logger in the White Mountain National Forest,
that means moving ahead with an initiative that ``is totally
ridiculous,'' he said. ``I agree that there are some areas that
should not be logged. But there are many that can and should be
logged.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Clinton unveiled his initiative to ban new roads for
logging and other uses on the 40 million acres, the agency that
must devise regulations in the coming year to carry it out _ the
Forest Service _ has been bombarded with criticism.
</P>
<P>
   In House and Senate hearings last month, Agriculture Secretary
Dan Glickman, Forest Service Chief Mike Dombeck, and Lyons were
lambasted by congressmen and senators who claimed the directive
circumvented Congress' role in managing the 192 million-acre
national forest system. The critics said the initiative would in
effect designate new wilderness areas in the forests, which by law
only Congress can do.
</P>
<P>
   Many congressmen and senators requested in letters that the
comment period be extended by three months. One letter from US Sen.
Judd Gregg, a New Hampshire Republican, was signed by 32 other
senators. New Hampshire Republicans Charles Bass and John Sununu
joined 46 other representatives in signing a second letter.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter from Republican senators Bob Smith, of New Hampshire
and Frank Murkowski of Arkansas, the two chairmen of committees
dealing with natural resources suggested that the Forest Service
has violated a major federal environmental law in failing to
provide the public with enough information and opportunity to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   This week, a presidential candidate chimed in. Arizona Senator
John McCain, a Republican, pledged while stumping in New Hampshire
to repeal the directive if elected. ``The idea that Washington
knows best and that local residents cannot be trusted to do what's
right in their own backyard is the epitome of federal arrogance,''
McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Forest Service says it has provided groups on all sides
of the initiative with ample information on it and time to comment,
including a three-day extension until Thursday and more than 200
meetings around the country. It adds that it is only starting work
on the regulations, trying to determine key issues, and there will
be more opportunities down the line for people of all persuasions
to have their say. ``We think we've already gone the extra mile,''
Lyons said.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative has been praised by environmental groups and
panned by industry groups because it would prevent roads from being
built on lands for logging and other activities.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, as on 43,000 acres in the White Mountains in New
Hampshire and Maine, they may be logged. As much as 150,000 acres
in total of the 774,000-acre forest could be protected by the
initiative. Vermont's 375,000-acre Green Mountain National Forest
would receive no immediate protection under the initiative, but
could if the current definition of a roadless area changes in the
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   To Lessard, who has logged in the White Mountains for 16 years,
the initiative ``is getting us away from a multiuse forest. When
the Forest Service took over that land, it was in deep trouble,''
he said, referring to reckless logging at the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've done a great job bringing it back, but as a multiuse
forest,'' he said. If responsible logging is limited any more than
it is now, ``I'm afraid the forest will revert to what it was.''

CANADA MOVES TO TIGHTEN SECURITY ALONG BORDER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ A Montreal woman arrested at a remote border crossing
in Vermont Sunday had made at least one earlier trip to New England
in recent days, raising fears that she may have already delivered
explosives or terrorist operatives, sources in the United States
and Canada said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Canada, meanwhile, moved to tighten security amid reports of
terrorist groups operating within its borders. The move came after
an unusual joint announcement by US Attorney General Janet Reno and
Canadian Solicitor General Lawrence MacAulay that the ``two
countries are working together to to deal with any potential threat
to security of citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators increasingly believe Montreal may be the key point
of connection in a radical Islamic terrorist conspiracy targeting
the United States. All of the three individuals arrested in Vermont
and Washington state have close ties to an ``Algerian underground''
in Canada's second-largest city.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent arrests came when Lucia Garofalo _ a 35-year-old
Quebecer with marriage ties to the Middle East _ was taken into
custody in Beecher Falls, Vt., after sniffer dogs trained to detect
bombmaking materials found trace amounts of explosives in her
Chrysler Neon. Accompanying Garofalo, and also still being held in
federal custody in Burlington, Vt., was Bouabide Chamchi, a
20-year-old Algerian living in Montreal, who was allegedly in
possession of an altered French passport.
</P>
<P>
   Like Ahmed Ressem, 32 _ the Algerian arrested in Washington
state last week with a carload of bombmaking gear _ Chamchi has
links to a Montreal-based ring of Algerian car thieves and break-in
artists whose criminal activities, police believe, are a way of
raising funds for terrorism abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Garofalo and Chamchi have only been charged with immigration
violations, including possession of a falsified French passport.
</P>
<P>
   However, Ressem was indicted by a federal grand jury in Seattle
Wednesday in connection with his Dec. 14 attempt to smuggle
nitroglycerine, timing devices and explosives material into the
United States from British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Ressem made his home in Montreal. News reports have linked him
to radical Islamic training camps in the Middle East. He has also
been linked to Algerian groups in France who use bank robbery and
other crimes to raise funds, a pattern similar to the groups with
which he may have been involved in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities on both sides of the border are especially alarmed
that on Dec. 6 Garofalo and an Algerian male _ tentatively
identified as Mustafa Roubici of Montreal _ crossed from Canada in
the same car in which she and Chamchi were apprehended on the later
trip. She crossed back into Canada on Dec. 12.
</P>
<P>
   In her successful entry to the United States, as as well as an
attempt on Dec. 15 in which she raised the suspicions of US border
authorities and was turned back, Garofalo went to extremely remote
border posts in Vermont and New Hampshire, none of them on a direct
route from Montreal to Boston, where she claimed to be headed. On
each occasion she was accompanied by different men of Middle
Eastern origin.
</P>
<P>
   The worst fear of investigators, although it remains only a
theory, is that on an earlier trip the car may have succesfully
carried bomb materials or terrorist operatives into the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's scarier than a carload of explosives?'' said an
investigator in Canada, answering his own rhetorical question: ``A
car with explosives residue that may have already made a successful
delivery somewhere. That's the very worst-case scenario.''
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement sources stressed, however, that the trace
amounts of explosives detected in her car could have an innocent
explanation _ such as the earlier transport of hunting weapons or
ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   A massive cross-border investigation into Garofalo, Chamchi,
Ressam, and other Montreal-based Islamic radicals continued as
federal, provincial and local police tried to piece together her
movements in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Little is known about Garofalo. According to a US official, her
husband is an Algerian recently deported from Canada who presently
resides in Europe. She may also have family ties to Libya,
according US prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 6, she and two male passengers entered the US through a
border crossing near Pittsburg, N.H., guarded only by a
surveillance camera and two-way speakers. A US immigration official
questioned her via the speaker but did not require the three
travelers to report to the nearest manned border post to show
identification.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 12, she returned to Canada at Stanstead, Quebec,
accompanied by the man identified as Roubici. Although he carried
no travel documents, he told Canadian authorities he was an
Algerian living in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   He was permitted to enter Canada, although officials there
reported his movement to US immigration officials since he appeared
to have been in the United States illegally.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 15, Garofalo attempted to enter the United States at
Pittsburg again. She was accompanied by a man who identified
himself as Ahmed Saheen of Pakistan. Because of the odd time, 2:35
a.m. and her curious route from Montreal, the US border inspector
grilled her more closely over the speaker system, and instructed
her to open the trunk of the vehicle. The surveillance camera
showed it to be full of boxes and luggage. She was instructed to
come around to a manned border station, but instead, law
enforcement officials say, she drove back to Canada.
</P>
<P>
   On all occasions, Garofalo said her destination was Boston.
</P>
<P>
   One law enforcment source speculated that Garofalo may work as a
``mule'' carrying illegal immigrants from the Middle East into the
United States, and may have no specific knowledge of their plans or
what they have in their possession.
</P>
<P>
   The Algerian facing charges in Seattle, Ressam, is suspected of
being an operative for a loose group of Islamic radicals with
connections to Canada and France. He had lived in Montreal after
applying for refugee status upon arriving in Canada from France in
February 1994. He claimed that the Algerian military had
``unjustly'' accused him of ``arms dealing'' on behalf of Islamic
radicals, according to Canadian news reports.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact he arrived carrying a fake French passport and
other falsified documents, Ressam was allowed to remain in Canada
with no restrictions other than a requirement that he check in
monthly with immigration authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials have not established a clear
connection between Ressam and Garofalo or Chamchi, the pair
arrested in Vermont. But sources said all three have strong links
to an underground of Algerian radicals residing in Montreal and
involved in criminal enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam was arrested on at least three occasions and convicted
once on charges of breaking into motor vehicles and stealing items
such as computers and cellphones. Chamchi has been charged at least
twice with stealing cars and breaking into motor vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Such crimes are the trademark of an Montreal-based Algerian
group, with links to France, suspected of using car theft and
extortion to raise money for ``financing terrorism,'' said a
Canadian intelligence official.
</P>
<P>
   According to authorities, Chamchi was in possession of an
``altered'' French passport in the name of Boudjemaa Ben Ali when
arrested in Vermont _ much as Ressam had carried false French
papers on his original entry to Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Chamchi and Garofalo told US officials that they drove
accidentally into Vermont while ``looking for a retaurant,''
according to federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   Canada Wednesday bowed to intense pressure from the United
States and critics at home to intensify anti-terrorist security at
airports and other entry points. The precautions include a
beefed-up guard by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police outside the US
Embassy in Ottawa. Closer checks of people entering Canada from
overseas were also being made at airports.

PUTTING NUMBERS TO THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Last weekend, Bill Bradley took Al Gore to
task for his gradualist approach on expanding health care coverage,
asking his rival again and again: ``Who would you leave out?''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the Bradley campaign provided its own answer: Melinda
Berg of Hillsborough, Tim Chrysostum of Canterbury, and Abbi
Orenstein of Manchester. The three, according to David Cutler, a
Harvard economist advising Bradley, are among the 81,000 of New
Hampshire's 94,000 uninsured people who would remain uninsured
under Gore's health care plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't afford to wait 10 or 20 years for health care,'' said
Orenstein, 24, a temporary agency worker without insurance
coverage. ``We need health care now.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's health care plan would start by insuring all children and
their parents and then moving toward universal health care down the
road. Bradley, on the other hand, would attempt to cover most
people by providing them with subsidies to purchase private health
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   By putting faces on the abstract policy debate, the Bradley
campaign was borrowing a page from the Gore playbook. Gore's New
Hampshire office has held several press conferences around the
state this year with people who are disabled and rely on Medicaid
for their health insurance. Those people have complained
vociferously that Bradley's plan would eliminate Medicaid and
replace it with an inferior alternative.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday it was the Bradley campaign's turn to worry aloud
about Gore's plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been fairly lucky, I've been healthy,'' said Chrysostum,
a 32-year-old who works at the Canterbury Shaker Village. ``But I
can't guarantee that will always be true, and at any moment I could
be one of the large group of people who become seriously ill and
have to be rushed to an emergency room without any way to pay for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Gore campaign produced its own numbers,
contending that over 100,000 of New Hampshire's Medicaid recipients
would be left in the lurch under Bradley's plan, and over 160,000
seniors on Medicare here would be made vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are tired of politicians making promises they don't
keep and Bradley's plan is one big promise he can't keep,'' said
Douglas Hattaway, Gore's spokesman here. ``Al Gore supports
universal health care but he's not promising that this problem can
be solved in one fell swoop.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While campaigning at West High School this week, Texas Governor
George W. Bush was asked about a federal report that said his state
was the second worst in the country for the percentage of hungry
households. Bush said he did not believe that five percent of Texas
children are suffering from hunger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I'm surprised a report floats out of Washington when I'm
running a presidential campaign,'' he said. ``It seems lot
of reports are floating out of Washington. You'd think the governor
would have heard if there are pockets of hunger in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that the embarassing report was spawned by the
Federal Food Security Measurement Project with the charge to
collect data annually to determine the amount of hunger in America.
And the president who signed the law that created the project that
churned out the report was none other than the candidate's father,
former President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Voters won't have long to wait before the first presidential
debates of the new millenium on January 5th and 6th. In keeping
with the new century, people can watch the debates on a live web
simulcast and answer questions from an online poll at
www.wiredvote.com, a new site sponsored by a variety of New
Hampshire corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore and Bill Bradley will participate in the Jan. 5 debate,
moderated by ABC's Peter Jennings. And the Republican candidates
will participate in the Jan. 6 debate, moderated by NBC's Tim
Russert. Both one-hour debates will be held at 7 p.m. at the
University of New Hampshire and broadcast by New Hampshire Public
Television, C-Span, New Hampshire Public Radio and a variety of ABC
and PBS stations across the country.

<P>
   These are exhilarating, and perhaps a bit frightening, times for
Zhang Yuan, 36, who is increasingly described in international film
circles as perhaps the most gifted and original filmmaker of his
generation, even though his movies have not been widely seen at
home or abroad.
</P>
<P>
   His past films, including ``Beijing Bastards'' (1992) and ``East
Palace, West Palace'' (1996), were banned in China because they
dealt with hidden subjects like alienated youths and furtive
homosexual encounters. That they were stylistically off-beat as
well _ ``Beijing Bastards'' was a deliberately raw, improvised
slice of life in the rock underground _ compounded his sins in the
eyes of Communist censors.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial market abroad for serious Chinese movies is quite
limited. But Zhang's seven feature films, including fiction and
documentaries, have become favorites on the international art-house
and film-festival circuit. Known for years as an intriguing
underground filmmaker, he is now swamped with invitations to appear
at festivals and seminars.
</P>
<P>
   Just in the last several weeks, Zhang _ a stocky man with a baby
face, the eyes of Edward G. Robinson and an explosion of curly hair
that could shame Gene Wilder _ attended a screening of his films at
the National Gallery of Art in Washington, spoke at a three-day
Zhang Yuan retrospective held by the Harvard Film Archive,
discussed his films at the University of Massac at Amherst,
traveled to London for a museum screening and then went on to
Argentina, where he helped judge a film festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize in his work a mastery of the medium,'' said Bruce
Jenkins, curator of the Harvard Film Archive, explaining why it
sponsored such a big program for a young, still-evolving director.
``You can already tell he'll have an impressive body of work, that
he'll be as important to his generation of filmmakers as Chen Kaige
and Zhang Yimou have been to theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins was referring to the ``fifth generation'' masters who
are in their late 40s and came out of the Beijing Film Academy
years before Zhang Yuan.
</P>
<P>
   More compelling to Zhang than the global acclaim, but also
potentially more perilous to his art, is the shaky bridge he is
crossing at home. Only two years ago, angry Chinese authorities
confiscated his passport when he tried to go to the Cannes
International Film Festival, where ``East Palace, West Palace'' had
been entered, and threatened him with prosecution if he tried to
make another film on the sly.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Zhang has just made two features in cooperation with the
government's film bureau, one fictional and one a documentary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been making films for almost 10 years now, and virtually
nothing has been seen by Chinese audiences,'' Zhang said in a
recent interview in Beijing, between trips to Boston and London.
``That's something that has really frustrated and pained me.''
</P>
<P>
   So to reach his home audience _ and avoid possible arrest _ he
allowed the censors to review the scripts and edited versions of
his new features. In the case of both the fictional feature,
``Seventeen Years,'' and the full-length documentary, ``Crazy
English,'' some last-minute cuts were required, Zhang said. And
now, ``Seventeen Years'' is scheduled to open commercially in
Beijing next month, and prospects are good for the documentary to
be released here, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``All artists have to make choices, and these become
limitations,'' Zhang said, obviously troubled by the subject and
aware that some younger artists here are wondering whether he has
lost his edge. ``Limitations are not necessarily all bad,'' he
continued, ``but as an artist you still have to make sure that what
you are doing remains real.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the background, Zhang is proud of his two new films and
at this stage would welcome more commercial success. While ``East
Palace, West Palace'' has played art houses in many countries and
brought in some money, Zhang has had to spend a large share of his
time over the last decade shooting commercials and rock videos for
a living, and trawling Europe and Asia for financial backers. He
and his wife, Ning Dai, a screenwriter, live well by Beijing
standards, but he still answers his own phone and makes all his own
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   In September, ``Seventeen Years'' won him the best-director
award at the Venice Film Festival. It does not yet have an American
distributor, but deals have been signed in Italy, Japan, Brazil and
several other countries.
</P>
<P>
   The film tells the story of a girl who murders her taunting
sister, then after 17 years in prison gets a leave to visit home to
see her aged, bitter parents. It will not be mistaken for a
Hollywood thriller: it proceeds quietly, the drama propelled by
silences and glances as much as by dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   But with its clean direction, Vermeeresque lighting and
memorable characters, and a simple, wrenching story with a happy
ending, the film may appeal to a broader audience here than Zhang's
more ponderous early films would have.
</P>
<P>
   The new documentary, ``Crazy English,'' is about Li Yang, a
wildly successful promoter who leads auditoriums full of Chinese in
shouting out English phrases _ the path, he says, to overcoming
inhibitions, learning English and making China strong. The feature
has no narration; rather, it just lets Li keep talking, and he is
so nimble and funny that the technique works.
</P>
<P>
   Some Western critics have suggested that the film is a subtle
expose of mob psychology, with allusions to Mao Zedong's Cultural
Revolution. Hearing that, Zhang laughs and says, ``That's going too
far.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if Li Yang does have that tendency, it's a funny and cool
one,'' he says. He hopes for a public television showing in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It's remarkable that Zhang ever got to make films at all, let
alone develop an original sensibility. He was born in 1963 in the
southern city of Nanjing. He had poor health, he says, and
cultivated a love of painting. Only at about age 20 did he become
interested in writing and film and learn that the Beijing Film
Academy, China's elite training ground, had reopened in 1978, after
the end of the Cultural Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, the academy advertised for a new batch of students.
Tens of thousands applied, including Zhang, who had little
knowledge of film but apparently did so spectacularly well in
essays and interviews that he was one of 16 students accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Up to that point the only foreign films that Zhang, like most
Chinese, had seen were from the Soviet Union, North Korea and
Yugoslavia. But the academy had copies of the best movies appearing
in the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was like someone who'd been starved for a long time,'' he
recalled. While specializing in cinematography, he devoured the
films of Martin Scorsese, watching ``Taxi Driver,'' ``Mean
Streets'' and others dozens of times. He also studied the work of
Italian directors like Antonioni and Fellini.
</P>
<P>
   But his biggest revelation, Zhang said, was seeing Chinese films
of the 1930s. ``That was a time when Chinese arts were at their
liveliest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   From the opening scene of his first film, ``Mama,'' about a
mother and her retarded child, which was completed in 1990, Zhang
established himself as a fresh cinematic voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nearly every one of Zhang Yuan's films has broken thematic and
stylistic ground,'' said Yaohua Shi, an expert on Chinese film at
the University of Massachusetts who served as host for Zhang and
his works recently. ``He has opted for a gritty, deliberately
unglamorous cinematic technique or the documentary style, often
avoiding visual pyrotechnics.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Zhang had made ``Mama'' through official channels, it
was not viewed favorably by officials and received almost no
distribution, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point I realized that if I really wanted to express my
own views about society, then I needed total independence,'' Zhang
said.
</P>
<P>
   The film he wanted to make next, ``Beijing Bastards,'' which
portrayed the amoral, apolitical lives of an underground youth
culture, could not remotely have passed official muster. ``They
couldn't have reviewed a script because we didn't have one!'' he
said of the 1992 film, which featured the alienated rock songs of
Cui Jian.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes called China's first independent feature, ``Beijing
Bastards'' was filmed with an intentionally rough quality
reminiscent of Andy Warhol, and it captured the attention of
cognoscenti.
</P>
<P>
   After a documentary about Tiananmen Square, Zhang made ``Sons,''
a realistic fiction about a father's alcoholism and insanity.
</P>
<P>
   ``East Palace, West Palace,'' in 1996, showed a new
sophistication and secured Zhang's reputation abroad. Showing the
gay underworld of city parks and a police officer's homoerotic pull
toward a masochistic cruiser, it examined themes that are simply
not discussed in public here.
</P>
<P>
   It may be no coincidence that in May 1996, China's cabinet
passed new ``Rules for Administration of Films'' that, among other
vague provisions, proscribed the making of movies that ``threaten
the security, reputation and interests of the state.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that the new film law specifically banned
independent filmmaking, outside the official studio system,'' said
Chris Berry, an expert on the Asian cinema at La Trobe University
in Melbourne, Australia. ``Before that it was a gray area.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhang says that after the 1997 clash over the showing of ``East
Palace, West Palace'' at the Cannes Film Festival, and the loss of
his passport, he knew he was at an impasse. ``If I had continued to
work the same way, I'd probably have lost my freedom,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After eight months of limbo, Zhang was given his passport back,
and he began intensive discussions with the film authorities,
leading to agreement in 1998 that he could resume making movies.
</P>
<P>
   Now, even as he eagerly anticipates his first Chinese commercial
release, he can't stop thinking about the strictures. ``An artist
has to express his point of view fully and without any
constraint,'' he said. ``If an artist can't do that, then there's
no hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Will he always be able to find topics that excite him and are
acceptable to the censors? ``I have no idea,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deng Xiaoping used a parable to describe how we should run our
economy,'' Zhang said, ```Crossing the river by feeling the stones,
one at a time.'''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I think China's artists also have to think this
way.''

LEADS IN TERRORISM THREAT LINKED TO BOSTON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY AND JUDY RAKOWSKY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ US authorities were tracking leads from around the
world Wednesday amid worries over end-of-the-year terror attacks
following the arrests in Vermont and Washington state of two
Algerian men, one of whom sought to enter the United States with
bomb-making materials.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle Wednesday, a federal grand jury indicted Ahmed
Ressam, 32, who was charged with transporting explosives,
possessing unregistered firearms, smuggling nitroglycerin, and
giving false information to border guards.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the new leads, US officials said, were linked to New
England, specifically the Boston area. In addition, there was
generalized concern about higher risk in New England because of the
ease in slipping across the porous US-Canada border.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, seeking to awaken Americans to the threat of
terrorist attacks in the coming days and weeks, asked the public to
be watchful for any suspicious activity _ and if witnessed, to
contact police. Still, he said that Americans should not ``stop
their holiday activities. I think they ought to go and enjoy the
season.''
</P>
<P>
   In New England, one investigation focused on a Montreal woman,
arrested Sunday with Algerian native Bouabide Chamchi at the remote
Beecher Falls, Vt., crossing. She successfully crossed the
US-Canada border earlier in December with two Algerian nationals,
telling border officials her destination was Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators were also seeking three men in connection with a
bombing plot in Jordan, one of whom was last known to live at 15
Appleton St. in Everett, Mass. and has a Massachusetts driving
license. He was identified by law enforcement sources as Raed
Hajazi, 21.
</P>
<P>
   In the White House and at the State Department, Defense
Department, and other national security agencies, debate flourished
for the third consecutive day on how best to alert the public to
the threats while trying not to ruin the holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Said one US official who attended several of the high-level
meetings: ``The problem is, how do you make people concerned but
not send them running to the bomb shelters?''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, after visiting a Washington soup kitchen, said, ``For
all citizens, I would say they ought to go about their holidays and
enjoy themselves and make the most of it. But I would ask them to
just be aware of their circumstances and, if they see anything
suspicious, to report it immediately, and meanwhile to know that we
are doing everything we possibly can.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the government was making ``extraordinary efforts . . .
based on the incident out in the Pacific Northwest and what we
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities, however, still had not made any definitive
connection between the Algerian-born Ressem and Osama bin Laden, a
wealthy Saudi Arabian sought by the United States for masterminding
the 1998 US embassy bombings in Africa. There is a widespread
assumption among intelligence officials that Ressem has ties to bin
Laden associates, likely during time he spent in France three years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Carefully choosing his words at a news conference, Deputy
Attorney General Eric Holder assessed the threat of a terrorist
attack: ``We do not have any specific information about particular
targets.''
</P>
<P>
   US officials said Holder, and other top US officials, had agreed
to stick to the phrases ``specific information'' and ``particular
targets'' because they were technically true and also useful in
alleviating fears. US intelligence officials, though, had amassed
several leads on general threats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we have general reporting that concerns us? Absolutely,''
said an administration official, speaking on condition of
anonymity. ``That's why we have have taken steps to raise the alert
status on the borders and issued the two warnings'' for Americans
living or travelling overseas.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department issued a second warning late Tuesday that
said, ``The US government believes that terrorists may be planning
to conduct attacks including against official and non-official
Americans, in and around the New Year period (from now through
mid-January 2000) with particular emphasis on locations where large
groups of people may congregate for millennial or religious
festivities.''
</P>
<P>
   US officials believe that if a terrorist group decides to attack
Americans it could happen anywhere in the world, and it could
happen in coordinated fashion in multiple locations. In August
1998, bin Laden's organization was believed responsible for two
almost simultaneous attacks on US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania
that killed more than 200 people.
</P>
<P>
   If terrorist attacks were to happen in the United States, the
most vulnerable places may be New England, New York City and parts
of the West Coast, US officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very concerned the Osama bin Laden group has cells set
up in New York, a little on the West Coast, and in quieter areas of
the upper East Coast, such as Connecticut, Massachusetts, New
Hampshire, Vermont and Maine,'' said a second US official, speaking
on condition of anonymity and refusing to give further details.
``The reason we're so concerned about New England is that there has
been so little attention paid in the past to the border crossings
up there.'' Those border crossings have been substantially
tightened in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, another US official said he believed the government
warnings made it safer for people to attend public gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about specific information on threats in New England, the
official said, ``Anyone who was not taking these threats seriously
is taking it seriously now. It's going to be important for First
Night in Boston, and all the other First Nights going on around New
England, that people are vigilant. In the end, that benefits
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli expert on terrorism, Boaz Ganor, said the arrests of
the two Algerian men _ if either or both are linked to terrorist
plans _ may break up a ring of terrorists. ``There is going to be
concern about what those people say in custody,'' Ganor said.
</P>
<P>
   But Neil Livingstone, chairman of GlobalOptions, a security and
crisis management company in Washington, said he believed the
arrests represented only the ``tip of the iceberg'' of terrorists'
plans.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted 10 to 15 terrorist attacks globally around the turn
of the millennium, possibly coming from several groups ``because
terrorists know that by marking the millennium with whatever they
do, they will be immortalized.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingstone and several US officials noted that the threat
worldwide was perhaps greatest in Jordan and Israel, where
authorities expect upward of 1.5 million tourists to descend on the
tiny state in the holiday season. Also vulnerable are US troops
stationed in Bosnia because of lax security around the borders, US
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But Livingstone said from a terrorist's perspective, the biggest
target remains the United States. ``If you can score the United
States, that's like getting center on the bull's eye,'' he said.

BELL ATLANTIC GETS LONG-DISTANCE OK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic Corp. became Wednesday the first Baby Bell local
telephone carrier to gain federal approval to offer long-distance
service.
</P>
<P>
   After getting the go-ahead to enter the long-distance market in
New York, the company now will seek federal permission by the
middle of next year to offer the same service in Massachusetts,
followed by Pennsylvania and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   In a landmark decision that launches a new era of competition,
the Federal Communications Commission Wednesday said the nation's
second-largest local phone company can offer the same wide range of
voice and advanced data communications in New York that AT&AMP;T Corp.,
MCI Worldcom Inc. and other long-distance carriers provide. These
companies are expected to mount a vigorous defense in the
marketplace against Bell Atlantic's attempts to capture
long-distance residential and business customers in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC approval, which was expected, puts the Baby Bells back
into the lucrative $100 billion-a-year long-distance market, an
arena the Bells had been barred from since they were spun out from
AT&AMP;T Corp. in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FCC's actions in New York is the most important
telecommunications decision of this decade. This is the now the
beginning of the end of local monopolies across America,'' said US
Representative Edward J. Markey, a Democrat from Malden, Mass., who
is the ranking Democrat on the House telecommunications, trade and
consumer protection subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it is possible for Massachusetts and other states to get
in line. I think this decision is to telecommunications what the
collapse of the Berlin Wall was to freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   For consumers, more competition promises choice, better prices,
new services and the end of local phone monopolies _ the central
premise of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. The law specified
the market-opening steps that regional Bell companies were required
to make before they could enter the long-distance business.
</P>
<P>
   Until Wednesday, the FCC had denied five long-distance
applications by regional Bell companies. The FCC, in its decision,
said Bell Atlantic can begin offering service in New York early
next year, and the company set Jan. 5 as its kickoff date.
</P>
<P>
   ``The road to this moment has not been easy,'' said FCC chairman
William Kennard.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was pleased with Bell Atlantic's long-distance
entry into New York. AT&AMP;T said it is considering legal actions
challenging the FCC's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``While Bell Atlantic has made real progress in New York, its
application still falls well short of the law's requirement in at
least two areas critical to competition,'' said AT&AMP;T general
counsel Jim Cicconi, in a statement. One of those areas concerns
how quickly and smoothly orders from customers switching from Bell
Atlantic to another long-distance carrier are handled.
</P>
<P>
   MCI, by contrast, said it was looking forward to battling Bell
Atlantic in New York's highly competitive long-distance market.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Ivan Seidenberg, Bell Atlantic's chairman, said his
company expects to seek FCC approval during the first half of 2000
to offer long-distance service in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will build on this (New York) success as quickly as
possible,'' said Seidenberg, noting that Massachusetts is the next
state where Bell Atlantic will seek FCC approval, followed by
Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The New York phone giant serves 13
states from Maine to Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, SBC Communications Inc., the San Antonio-based phone
giant, said it plans to file its application to offer long-distance
service in Texas with the FCC in early January.
</P>
<P>
   Since September, Bell Atlantic has been testing its Bay State
computer and communications systems to meet a 14-point checklist
required for FCC approval. A key test requires Bell Atlantic to
quickly switch customers to a competitor upon the customer's
request. That means making sure telephone records, phone lines and
billing information are shifted smoothly through a computerized
operational support system.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, as in Massachusetts, this testing is overseen by
KPMG Worldwide, the giant accounting and consulting firm. In a
process involving parallel federal and state approvals, KPMG is
expected to complete its testing for the Bay State's Department of
Telecommunications and Energy in late March. On Tuesday, the DTE
completed a series of regulatory hearings on Bell Atlantic's
long-distance plans.
</P>
<P>
   DTE commmissioner Paul B. Vasington Wednesday said that the
commission could give its recommendation in June if Bell Atlantic
meets regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>
   He said Bell Atlantic then would file an application with the
FCC (the document was 88,500 pages long for New York) detailing how
it opened its local markets to competition and complied with the
Telecommunications Act of 1996. The DTE also would write a report,
based on the KPMG findings. Both documents then would be sent to
the FCC, which has 90 days to make its decision.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, AT&AMP;T and MCI are watching how Bay State regulators
handle Bell Atlantic's long-distance application, MCI claims the
local phone company is not far along in its testing yet. ``We're
watching them very closely,'' said spokeswoman Elena French.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T plans to offer local telephone service via cable when its
proposed acquisition of cable television giant MediaOne Group is
completed next year. Unlike New York, where AT&AMP;T has hardly any
cable ownership, MediaOne controls about 60 percent of the state's
cable TV industry with more than 1 million customers.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic shares were down 1 1/16 to close at 64 1/2
Wednesday.

GENE TRANSFER TECHNIQUE USED IN MONKEYS MAY AID HUMANS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ore., Md., Calif., Hawaii)  (th) 
 By GINA KOLATA    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists in Oregon have installed jellyfish genes in monkey
embryos using a technique that might eventually be used to create
monkeys with added human genes, according to a report being
published on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Such a technique would allow those genes to be studied for the
development of treatments for human diseases. But the scientists
say they are acutely aware that their research raises a host of
troubling questions about reproductive technology.
</P>
<P>
   If scientists can add genes to monkey embryos, it should be
possible to add genes to human embryos, raising the emotionally
fraught issue of human genetic engineering.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are matters that need to be discussed,'' said Dr. Barry
Zirkin, who leads the division of reproductive biology at the Johns
Hopkins University School of Public Health in Baltimore, who was
not connected with the Oregon research.
</P>
<P>
   What stands out, some experts said, is how simple the method is.
If it is refined to be highly effective in monkeys, it could be
just a short step to using it to add genes to human embryos.
</P>
<P>
   Some genes might correct diseases or prevent them _ such as an
AIDS resistance gene, or one that might make a person less
susceptible to Alzheimer's disease. Adding such genes might be akin
to vaccinating a child.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of other genes might be more problematic. Dr. Inder
Verma, a molecular biologist at the Salk Institute in La Jolla,
Calif., who also was not connected with the work, gave the example
of a gene for the glutamate receptor protein in the brain, which
may improve memory.
</P>
<P>
   What if it worked and then humans wanted that gene? ``If
something can be done, people will do it,'' Verma said, though he
added that he was comforted by the thought that there would be very
few people who could afford such genetic engineering, and even
fewer who would want it.
</P>
<P>
   The current study being published Thursday in the journal
Molecular Human Reproduction, is more of a demonstration of
feasibility, experts said. To add genes to monkey embryos, Dr.
Gerald Schatten of the Oregon Primate Research Center at Oregon
Health Sciences University in Beaverton, and his colleagues began
by mixing jellyfish genes with sperm cells from rhesus monkeys. The
genes stuck naturally to the outside of the sperm cells.
</P>
<P>
   Then the scientists tried to use those sperm to fertilize eggs,
asking whether the added jellyfish genes became part of the
developing embryos. The gene encodes instructions for a protein
that gives jellyfish a green glow. If it got into the monkey
embryos and functioned, the embryo cells would glow green under a
fluorescent light.
</P>
<P>
   In one set of experiments, the scientists fertilized about 20
monkey eggs in vitro, mixing sperm and eggs in a petri dish. With
that method, which mimics natural fertilization, the sperm swims to
the egg and discards its protein coat as it enters. The extra gene
was discarded with the coat as the sperm penetrated the egg. Only
the sperm's genetic material got in.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists also fertilized 81 eggs by directly injecting
them with the gene-containing sperm. Then, they report, the
jellyfish genes entered the eggs with the sperm. The consequence
was clear when the scientists shined a fluorescent light on the
embryos. ``More than a third of the embryos fluoresced,'' Schatten
said.
</P>
<P>
   Using seven of the monkey embryos created by direct sperm
injection into eggs, Schatten and his colleagues tried to create
pregnancies and got a set of stillborn twins and one live male
monkey.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists have not found evidence that the gene was
incorporated into any of the monkeys' cells. But, they and others
say, they have no doubt that the method will work, because it was
recently shown to work in mice.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, in the journal Science, Dr. Ryuzo Yanagimachi
at the University of Hawaii and his colleagues reported that they
had mixed the same jellyfish gene with mouse sperm, injected the
sperm into mouse eggs and created pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   They reported that 11 of the 57 mice that were born had the
jellyfish gene: when they examined cells from the animals' tail
tips under a fluorescent light, the cells glowed green.
</P>
<P>
   Yanagimachi said that while he was disappointed that the first
monkeys did not have the added gene, ``this is just a matter of
time before it can be done.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Monkeys, Schatten said, can be invaluable in studies of human
disorders.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think of their value as a disease model or for
understanding cognition or mental disorders or all sorts of
diseases and disorders that appear in people, this is a very small
first step,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, the experiment raises darker questions about a
popular fertility treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The sperm injection method is a standby in fertility clinics,
where it is used 10,000 to 20,000 times a year in about 200
American clinics. Discovered by accident less than a decade ago,
the method, called intracytoplasmic sperm injection, or ICSI,
revolutionized the treatment of male infertility. It allowed men
whose sperm do not move, men whose sperm cannot penetrate an egg
and men whose sperm are not even ejaculated to become fathers.
</P>
<P>
   But ICSI (pronounced ICK-see) puts whole sperm, along with
whatever may be attached to them, into egg cells. Schatten noted
that viruses can attach themselves to sperm and no amount of
rinsing can get them off. With ICSI, these viruses would be
injected directly into eggs where, his work shows, their genes
could start to function. And while there is no proof so far that
babies born from ICSI procedures have unusual diseases, the
prospect has troubled some scientists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a significant concern,'' said Dr. Peter N. Schlegel, a
specialist in male infertility at the Weill Medical College of
Cornell University. But he noted that most of the monkey embryos
did not take up the genes that Schatten attached to the sperm.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paul Turek, a specialist in male infertility at the
University of California in San Francisco, says he will add the new
information from the monkey experiments when he is counseling
patients who are considering ICSI. ``They can decide whether they
want to go forward or not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Turek added that while he would continue with ICSI for those
who want it, he would not give a blanket recommendation to
everything that becomes technologically possible just because there
is a market for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fall back on the fact that I am an ethical religious man,''
he said. As such, he said, he continually questions where the
boundaries lie.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think technology is forging way ahead of biology,
ethics and common sense,'' Turek went on. ``All of us think about
this all the time. All of the clinicians wonder what we are
doing.''

LENGTHY US-CANADA BORDER REPLETE WITH LEAKS 
</HEADLINE>

 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forest City, Maine, with its winter population of five, is
hardly a hot spot for illegal immigration from Canada. So trusting
are Immigration and Naturalization Service officials that,
normally, only a surveillance camera guards the border crossing
after the federal agent goes home for the day.
</P>
<P>
   But a lot has changed this week.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since the Persian Gulf War in 1991, US border
officials have been put on a heightened state of alert, and they
are particularly concerned about the 798-mile stretch of the border
along New England. Not only is the rural, wooded border lightly
guarded, but it is near the major Canadian cities of Montreal and
Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, smugglers of everything from cigarettes to
illegal aliens have found the New England border an easy target.
But the arrests this week in Vermont of two people amid speculation
they may be involved in terrorism has cast the smuggling issue in a
more sinister light.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned about the border out here. I'm wondering if it's
possible for (terrorists) to go across because it is such a remote
area. It would be an easy job at night,'' said Donna Gilman,
postmaster in Brookton, which provides mail to Forest City. ``It
gives me pause.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Immigration and Naturalization Service say they
have ratcheted up security along the 5,500-mile US-Canadian border
more as a precaution than in response to a specific threat.
Christmas vacations for Border Patrol agents are being cancelled,
and staff increased so that no one works alone and all official
border checkpoints, including tiny Forest City, have 24-hour
staffing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be on the safe side,'' said Raymond Kelly, director
of the US Customs Service, which manages border checkpoints along
with INS. ``It's prudent. It's not in response to any specific
threat. We just think it's wise to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   But, with only 107 Border Patrol agents assigned to guard the
entire region, some federal law enforcement officials believe more
are needed to pose a real threat to border jumpers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone wants to carry out an intelligent plan to cross the
border undetected, I'd say the chances of them getting through are
pretty good,'' said Jay McCloskey, the U.S. Attorney for Maine, who
has prosecuted numerous immigration cases during a 20-year-career.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's arrest of Bouabide Chamchi, an Algerian, along with
Canadian Lucia Garofalo, at the border crossing in Beecher Falls in
northeastern Vermont came very close to home for some people.
Coupled with the earlier arrest of an Algerian Ahmed Ressam in
Washington on charges of trying to smuggle bomb-making supplies
into the country, it put a threatening new focus on the world's
longest open border.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that some of these entry locations may have been
identified by terrorist groups and we've cancelled all annual
leave,'' said Roland Richardson, deputy chief with the US Border
Patrol in Houlton, Maine. ``All of our agents are on the job and
happy to be there given the possibility of entries that could be
coming through here.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the US-Canada border, unlike the US border with
Mexico, was never designed to be leak-proof. Families live on both
sides of the border in communities such as Calais, Maine, and St.
Stephen, New Brunswick, while part of the library in Derby, Vt., is
actually in Canada. For these communities, frequent border
crossings are a way of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``People might cross the border three times a day coming to the
store, going to visit grandma or whatever,'' said Jean Ouellette,
deputy director of the Immigration and Natural Service regional
office in Portland, Maine, noting these people tend to support
measures making border crossing easier.
</P>
<P>
   Ouellette estimates that one-third of the 15 million people who
enter New England from Canada each year come through just three
stations, including Calais. Some of the 36 other official border
crossings in the region, such as Pittsburg, N.H., receive fewer
than 100 border crossings a day.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, for long stretches of the 600-mile Maine border
with Canada, only unguarded logging roads connect the two
countries. In such rural areas, border crossers are either subject
to video surveillance or directed by a sign to check in at the
nearest staffed border crossing.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, New England's frontier has sometimes been
targeted by smugglers of both humans and material goods. Slightly
west of New England, the most notorious smuggling route is the
Akwesasne Mohawk Reserve between New York State and Ontario, near
Quebec. Illegal immigrants pay Indian guides to bring them to the
United States side every year, counting on Canadian and American
reluctance to crack down on an Indian reserve.
</P>
<P>
   However, Marcus Russell at the Immigration and Naturalization
Service in Houlton, Maine, estimates that less than one-tenth of
one percent of the 15 million people who come from Canada into New
England each year are attempting to do something illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Border Patrol agents detained just 3,025 people in the
last fiscal year in New England and eastern New York, a tiny
fraction of those arrested entering the United States from Mexico.
Some say the low numbers reflect the fact that the Border Patrol
has just 107 agents to patrol almost 1,000 miles of border, but
federal officials say sensors and video cameras hidden in the woods
increase the reach of their force.
</P>
<P>
   Along the border Wednesday, some residents accepted federal
reassurances, noting that many of these border regions are so tight
knit that strangers stand out.
</P>
<P>
   ``People know everybody here . . . Even if you cross in the
middle of a field here, someone's going to see you and you'll get
caught.'' John Martin of Richford, Vt.

   HOLYOKE, Mass. _ Patrolman John DiNapoli wasn't supposed to be
on the beat Wednesday morning when he volunteered to help break up
a fight in a rough part of town. The impulse cost him his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could have kept on going and nobody would have known the
difference,'' Holyoke Police Chief Marc Cournoyer said. ``But that
would not have been John.''
</P>
<P>
   DiNapoli, a 21-year veteran whose normal duties involved
administrative work and classroom stints as McGruff the Crime Dog,
was killed when the suspect he was chasing spun around, drew a gun
and fired into DiNapoli's unmarked car, police said.
</P>
<P>
   DiNapoli, 52, wounded in the abdomen, shoulder, arm and heart,
died minutes later at a Springfield hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting touched off a massive, intense manhunt for the
suspect, Eddie Morales, who was charged in a warrant with
DiNapoli's murder and was still at large Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   DiNapoli, the father of two grown children, joined the force
after a friend who was a police officer was killed in the line of
duty in 1977. Officer James Gatzounas died from a heart attack
while breaking up a fight. Gatzounas was the last Holyoke officer
on the 130-person force to die in the line of duty and DiNapoli was
the first to die of gunshot wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Morales, 27, had lived in the neighborhood around Sergeant and
Walnut streets, the scene of the fight. Police said he was known to
authorities in both cities and Holyoke residents reported that
Morales was connected to a gang that patterned itself after the
Latin Kings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Morales, he's trouble,'' said Tom Obuchowski, a longtime
Holyoke resident who grew up with DiNapoli's children.
</P>
<P>
   After the killing several dozen city and State Police officers,
some dressed in SWAT team gear, searched buildings, blocked off
streets and put up checkpoints in a furious search for Morales. A
State Police helicopter hovered overhead and police ordered
children from some neighborhoods to stay in school until their
parents could retrieve them.
</P>
<P>
   The full-scale search ultimately was called off at about 2:30
p.m., but officers said they were still confident Morales would be
found.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, residents of the neighborhood where DiNapoli
was killed have complained that the area has been overrun by gangs,
drug dealers and prostitutes. Police have lately stepped up their
presence there, residents said. Some suggested that the shooting
may have been a response to their increased attention.
</P>
<P>
   DiNapoli had just dropped off a fellow officer at Juvenile Court
when he heard the call about the fight. The nearest on-duty
officers were several blocks away, Holyoke police officials said.
DiNapoli was a block and a half away, and figured he could help.
Police would not say whether he had a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he did this morning was typical of police officers and
typical of him. He responded to a call he thought he could assist
in.'' said Arthur Therrien, a training officer with the department,
who shared an office with DiNapoli.
</P>
<P>
   As police searched for Morales, residents hung out windows and
lingered on streetcorners, watching the spectacle. As the hours
passed, many shrugged and grumbled that the supsect was probably
long gone.
</P>
<P>
   Cournoyer issued a plea to Morales to give himself up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to stop looking for you until we find you,''
the chief said.
</P>
<P>
   Cournoyer said Morales shouldn't worry that police will mistreat
him because of the alleged crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would extend to him my personal guarantee he will be treated
with the utmost respect,'' Cournoyer said. ``One thing that's very
important to John DiNapoli is that he would not want anyone to
jeopardize their career or the investigation because of emotional
feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   He asked anyone with information about Morales to call the
police department at 413-536-6431.
</P>
<P>
   DiNapoli was the second police officer in the state to die on
duty this month. Wareham police Officer Christopher Argentinis was
killed when struck by a State Police cruiser as he tried to help
chase a suspect Dec. 11.

MILLOY'S FUTURE UP IN THE AIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ Lawyer Milloy, the only Patriots player to be named
to the AFC Pro Bowl starting team Wednesday, has dropped more than
a few hints that he may want to play football elsewhere next
season.
</P>
<P>
   One problem: The Patriots might not make it easy for him to walk
away.
</P>
<P>
   Milloy, who will be an unrestricted free agent at season's end,
was quite down Wednesday about the team's failure to make the
playoffs for the first time since being selected in the second
round out of Washington in 1996. Asked if he was returning to the
Patriots, Milloy said, ``I can't answer that question.''
</P>
<P>
   Milloy's comments about his Pro Bowl honor belied his feelings
about the status of the team: ``I'm tired of walking around like a
zombie,'' said Milloy. ``Not being able to vie for a championship
is very disappointing. We have so much talent on this team that to
be out of it . . . I'm disappointed. I'm team-oriented and I get
individual accolades through team success. . . . It's an individual
achievement. There's definite gratification for me and my family.
But when the team isn't involved, it doesn't mean as much to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Milloy and the Patriots negotiated during the bye week in
November and came to a philosophical understanding of where Milloy
would fit. Milloy also met with owner Robert Kraft and came away
feeling positive about a deal. No dollars were offered, but
Milloy's representatives made it clear that Milloy, now a two-time
Pro Bowler, would be the league's highest-paid safety, which meant
a six- or seven-year deal worth about $30 million-$35 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots, however, have the option of slapping a franchise
tag on Milloy, which means he would play  team at the
average salary of the top five players at that position. Milloy, of
course, could still go elsewhere, but as a franchise player, his
new team would have to give the Patriots two No. 1 draft picks.
</P>
<P>
   Safeties aren't generally franchised, and the Patriots have
never franchised a player. They came close to doing it with Willie
McGinest last year, but in the end McGinest got his five-year deal
worth $25 million, including an $8 million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots vice president Andy Wasynczuk detests the franchise tag
and has avoided it all costs. Wednesday he hesitated but used it in
Milloy's case, feeling that he and Milloy's agent, Ray Anderson,
have negotiated in good faith and thinks there's no reason the
sides can't work something out.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of time for Ray and I to talk,'' said Wasynczuk.
``We'd made very good progress and we decided to pick it up at the
end of the season. We'll stick to that.''
</P>
<P>
   The league and the NFL Players Association have extended the
period a team has exclusive time to sign its own unrestricted free
agents. It used to be two weeks after the Super Bowl, but now it
will be March 1 before players can pursue other employment.
</P>
<P>
   The downside of franchising Milloy would be that he would likely
hold out if he was that unhappy, as did Seattle receiver Joey
Galloway and Cincinnati receiver Carl Pickens the last two years.
Milloy hasn't said he'll do that, either. But right now he's not in
a great state of mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be truthfully honest, I don't know what's going to happen
after this year,'' he said. ``Individually, I know that based on my
performance, I'm going to make a little more money than before.
That's certain being here or someplace else. I owe this
organization my exisiting contract. I owe my teammates two more
games and they're going to get my all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty much finished. Everything is gonna affect it. I'll
weight out every scenario. I'll put myself in position to win a
championship. I'm going to lay out every possible scenario. If you
know me, it doesn't matter how much money I make. I'd be miserable
if I don't win. You can get paid a lot of money and not be happy,''
said Milloy, dropping another hint.
</P>
<P>
   He was quick to add that looking around the room he wasn't the
only player who might be with another team next year, which worries
him about where the team might be going.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the only player in this situation,'' he said. ``One of
the players I respect so much a player who plays like me, but he's
on the other side of the ball is Troy Brown, and there's Shawn
Jefferson and Steve Israel . . . This team could drastically
change. That's why you have that zombie effect around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, he doesn't believe the Patriots belong watching the
playoffs. ``There's so much talent, that's the other reason it's so
frustrating,'' he said. ``Take nothing away from Cleveland and
Philly and Cincinnati, but we have the talent. We should have
beaten those teams.''
</P>
<P>
   He will get his happiness this Christmas, not necessarily from
the Pro Bowl berth, but more so from his daughter, who will visit
from the Seattle area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing some shopping, putting together a turkey, wrapping
presents by myself, and putting a Christmas tree up,'' he said.
``I'm looking forward to that. I'm trying to channel my negative
energy to her. You need family in your spare time. She always gives
me a smile, which is important to me because I'm not the best
person to be around when we're losing.''
</P>
<P>
   While some players and Pete Carroll speak of salvaging something
the rest of the season, Milloy already feels all is lost. He
doesn't believe anyone can save themselves in the next two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too late for that,'' said Milloy. ``I've already told you
guys that just because you do something the final two weeks that
doesn't make up for messing up.''

SCUDDER KEMPER TO PAY $250,000 FOR IMPROPER TRADES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scudder Kemper Investments Inc. will pay a $250,000 fine to
settle federal allegations that a former employee in its Boston
office lost more than $16 million in unauthorized trades.
</P>
<P>
   Scudder and the former trader, Michael T. Sullivan, did not
admit to or deny the findings of an investigation conducted by the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   But Scudder agreed to the fine under an adminstrative order the
SEC issued Wednesday. Sullivan, who resigned after the improper
trades were discovered in 1998, will be barred from the securities
industry for at least five years. He lacks the resources to pay a
civil penalty, the SEC determined.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan's former supervisor, Gary Paul Johnson, was also cited
by the commission. He did not admit to or deny the charges, either,
but agreed to be suspended as an investment adviser for three
months and to pay a $10,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   According to the settlement documents, from at least July 1997
through October 1998, Sullivan ``repeatedly ignored loss limits''
and other financial controls and concealed his activities by
miscoding order tickets and forging supervisors' signatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had to disguise that activity, or theoretically his
supervisors would have known,'' said Juan Marcelino, the SEC's
district administrator in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators also faulted Johnson for not detecting the
losses. In addition, the SEC found that Scudder's ``controls and
procedures were not designed reasonably to prevent and detect the
trader's activities,'' according to the order.
</P>
<P>
   Scudder, the big mutual-fund company owned by Swiss-based Zurich
Financial Services Group, has about 1,000 employees in Eastern
Massachsetts, centered in downtown Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Scudder said it discovered the improper trades through its own
reviews and called them to the SEC's attention late last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This individual violated our written policies and practices,''
the firm said in a prepared statement. Scudder spokeswoman Eleanor
Mascheroni declined to discuss whether insurance covers the losses.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's attorney, Joseph Goldstein of the Kirkpatrick &AMP;
Lockhart firm in Washington, declined to comment. Efforts to reach
Sullian via his attorney didn't succeed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan, now 37, joined Scudder in 1984 and according to the
SEC was working as a derivatives trader in 1996, when the firm
implemented a trading program that gave him and other officers new
powers to initiate trades, within certain limits. From July 1997
until he left the company in 1998, Sullivan exceeded those limits
on 12 out of 20 institutional accounts.
</P>
<P>
   But he avoided detection by making it appear some of his trades
were of a type not subject to the program's limits, the SEC wrote,
using forged signatures on order tickets or simply failing to file
those documents as required.
</P>
<P>
   Scudder's Mascheroni declined to say who at Scudder first
noticed the losses, though Scudder has since halted the trading
program in question.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 50, left Scudder this year for reasons Mascheroni
declined to discuss. He previously had oversight of Scudder's
derivatives trading desk and, the SEC wrote, ``knew or should have
known of certain significant irregulaties.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor were porfolio managers given enough information to monitor
the trades that were conducted on behalf of their accounts, the SEC
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Scudder said that as a result of the investigation it has
``implemented enhancements to its policies and procedures related
to derivatives trading.'' Mascheroni declined to discuss specific
changes.

Looking for a smart, spoofy movie this holiday season? 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Populated with sitcom actors and a self-mocking Sigourney Weaver
and Alan Rickman, the cast of ``Galaxy Quest'' appears to be made
up of people who were left out of a hipster comedy like ``Mystery
Men'' _ and got their revenge by throwing a more entertaining
party. It can be a joy watching actors have a good time, especially
in this largely morose holiday-movie season, and ``Galaxy Quest's''
performers seem to be having the time of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The actors they're playing, however, aren't _ at least not at
the beginning of the movie. They're the stars of a long-canceled
``Star Trek''-like TV show called ``Galaxy Quest,'' apparently
doomed forever to a life of show-convention appearances and
reaching the point William Shatner did on a ``Saturday Night Live''
sketch when he began screaming, ``Get a life, people!'' at obsessed
fans.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out, though, that among ``Galaxy Quest's'' devotees are
four aliens disguised as humans (who apparently got their earthly
fashion sense from an old Devo album cover). They believe the show
is real and recruit the star, Jason Nesmith (Tim Allen), to aid in
their battle against some horrifically ugly enemy aliens (led by
British actor Robin Sachs, doing a great villain turn from within
an 80-pound costume).
</P>
<P>
   It's when Nesmith figures out that the aliens, and their ship,
are real that the movie really comes to life _ and it doesn't waste
a lot of time getting to that point. As Nesmith brings the rest of
his ``crew'' on board, Allen portrays him with growing childlike
glee, as if he were already thinking about counting his ``Toy Story
2'' money. His exuberance turns him into the movie's ``captain,''
inspiring his supporting cast to join the battle.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Quest'' has a tendency to lurch back and forth like a
starship in a meteor shower, switching from comedy to
straightforward science-fiction and throwing in scattered shrill or
maudlin moments, it always rights itself before it goes off course.
Credit that to director Dean Parisot's trust in his cast and his
ability to keep things flying at a fast pace.
</P>
<P>
   Parisot's trust allows for some sharp scene-stealing by Rickman,
whose comic disdain is perfectly suited to a dignified actor stuck
in pseudo-Klingon makeup, and by Tony Shalhoub, as the show's
technical sergeant who proves to have as much sardonic panache in
real life as he did on the show.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver and Daryl Mitchell show good-humored sportsmanship in
enduring the kind of token roles they would have had on a TV series
(Mitchell is probably happy to be in anything that's not
``Veronica's Closet''), while Sam Rockwell is the extraneous guest
star who seems destined not to survive the mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Galaxy Quest'' might look like goofy fun at first glance, but
it's actually very smart; this is the first live-action comedy in
recent memory to not include potty humor or crotch-injury jokes.
Screenwriters David Howard and Robert Gordon actually find humor in
words, with deceptively throwaway dialogue given sharp twists by
the timing of Allen, Rickman and Shalhoub. A smart, spoofy
major-studio comedy _ fortunately, it hasn't become an alien
concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``Galaxy Quest'' is rated PG for cartoonish violence, occasional
profanity, and Sigourney Weaver's cleavage. &QL;

   TAKE-BOS  
 BOSTON: ... of bounds.  8. Bird steals from Isiah: Bird picks off Isiah Thomas's inbounds
pass with five seconds left and feeds an off-balance pass to Dennis
Johnson for the winning basket in a 108-107 victory over the
Pistons in Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Finals, May 26, 1987. 
 
9. Parish belts Laimbeer: In the same game as the Bird steal,
Robert Parish and Bill Laimbeer get into a scuffle and Parish fires
off a few punches, which earns him a $7,500 fine and one-game
suspension, not to mention the adoration of Garden fans. 
 
10. Henderson's steal: Gerald Henderson steals James Worthy's pass
to Byron Scott with 13 seconds left and the game tied at 113 in
Game 2 of the Finals May 31, 1984. The Celtics go on to beat the
Lakers in overtime, 124-121. 
 
11. Heard's buzzer-beater: Phoenix's Gar Heard, taking an inbounds
pass with just one second showing on the clock, hits an improbable
22-footer to send Game 6 of the Finals into a third overtime,
setting up a 128-126 triple-overtime Celtics victory June 4, 1976. 
 
12. Magic's hook shot: In Game 4 of the Finals against the Lakers,
June 9, 1987 _ after Bird had hit a 3-pointer to put the Celtics
ahead _ Magic Johnson curls in a shot over the heads of Bird,
Parish, and McHale to give Los Angeles a 107-106 victory. 
 
13. Sam Jones grabs a chair: In a playoff game against the
Phiadelphia Warriors April 1, 1962, Jones is fouled _ hard _ by
Wilt Chamberlain. With thoughts of retaliation, but realizing he
was at a bit of a height disadvantage, Jones arms himself with a
photographer's stool, just in case. 
 
14. Cowens hits the floor: With the score tied in the final minute
in a playoff game against the Milwaukee Bucks May 10, 1974, Dave
Cowens, switching off his man, knocks the ball away from Oscar
Robertson, and dived after it to force a 24-second violation. The
Celtics eventually lost in overtime. 
 
15. Wilt vs. Russell: Bill Russell and Chamberlain jump center
court at Boston in 68 games, a total of more than 270 vertical
showdowns. 
 
16. McHale's towel: Before stepping to the free throw line, McHale
would go through a ritual that included making use of a towel left
under the basket to wipe off the sweat. 
 
17. Red's cigar: Opponents _ and everyone in the Garden _ knew when
coach Red Auerbach felt the Celtics had the game securely in hand,
as he would light up his famous victory cigar. 
 
18. A pigeon takes the floor: With the Celtics trailing Game 5 of
their playoff series with the Pistons, May 9, 1991, a pigeon
suddenly appears on the parquet, holding up play. Moments later,
the bird reappears as Parish is approaching the foul line. It must
have been a lucky pigeon, as the Celtics rally for a 109-103
victory. 
 
19. Keeping time: Tony Nota served as timekeeper at the Garden for
many years, though it was hard to keep track of how many times he
was fired _ then rehired _ by Auerbach. 
 
20. Heinsohn's hook: Celtics forward Tommy Heinsohn liked this spot
_ among others _ for his patented hook shot that was a big part of
his career 18.6 scoring average. 
 
21. Kareem's hook shot: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar hits an amazing hook
shot from the corner to give Milwaukee a 102-101 victory over the
Celtics May 10, 1974 to force Game 7 in the 1974 Finals. 
 
22. Bird's fractured cheek: Bird hits his face hard on the floor
with 4:23 left in the half of a deciding Game 5 with Indiana May 5,
1991. He's not on the court when the second half begins, but with
6:46 left in the third quarter, the crowd goes wild when Bird
emerges from the locker room and helps lead the Celtics to a
122-121 victory.

COMPELLING `ANGELA'S ASHES' LOSES SOMETHING IN TRANSLATION
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: EMBARGOED until Friday, Dec. 24) 
Our rating: 2 1/2 stars 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The film version of ``Angela's Ashes,'' Frank McCourt's Pulitzer
Prize-winning memoir, was probably a doomed venture from the
outset, given that the elements that made the book such a wonderful
read _ McCourt's language and inimitable voice _ simply cannot be
transferred to the screen. And while director Alan Parker manages
to capture the book's abject poverty and misery (perhaps a little
too well), his rather superficial adaptation too often fails to
convey McCourt's wry humor, which made the memoir so delightful.
</P>
<P>
   Parker, who co-wrote the screenplay adaptation with Laura Jones,
also made a fatal tactical error by deciding to re-create just
about every event in the book. That's a tall order, even given the
film's generous twp-hour, 25-minute running length. To cram
everything in, Parker rushes the audience from one episode to the
next, the economical treatment robbing the story of its emotional
wallop.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, there are plenty of wallop-packing events in
``Angela's Ashes.'' The McCourts _ long-suffering Angela (Emily
Watson); her alcoholic husband, Malachy (Robert Carlyle); and their
four children _ made the unusual move of emigrating back to Ireland
from the United States. Attempting to escape the poverty of New
York in the 1930s, the McCourts find conditions far worse in
Ireland. Their situation isn't helped much by the perpetual
dampness of Limerick and Malachy's northern accent. (Few will hire
him because of it.) When Malachy does work, he tends to take his
paycheck directly to the local pub.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiering through the cold and hunger is young Frank, the
oldest of the McCourt children. Parker employs three young actors
(Joe Breen, Ciaran Owens, Michael Legge) to portray Frank at ages
5, 10 and 16, and they do so with remarkable consistency and
cohesion.
</P>
<P>
   Readers of ``Angela's Ashes'' (and there are millions of them)
will undoubtedly enjoy seeing some of the book's scenes come to
life. Indeed, production designer Geoffrey Kirkland has re-created
the McCourts' lowly Limerick neighborhood with such incredible
detail that McCourt himself thought he had entered a time warp when
he visited the set one day. The film's washed-out photography,
combined with the eternal gray skies and moist landscapes,
marvelously evoke McCourt's Ireland and its miserable poverty.
</P>
<P>
   But to truly succeed and stand on its own, the movie needs to
illuminate more than soggy scenery. Parker's ``Angela's Ashes''
isn't a washout, but neither does it approach the book's soaring
lyricism. Mostly, it's just unnecessary. &QL; 
____ &QL; 
The film: ``Angela's Ashes'' (R; sexual content and some
language). &QL;

IN NEW YORK, THE MAYOR AND MRS. CLINTON TRADE CHARGE AND
COUNTER-CHARGE
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani asserted on Wednesday that
Democrats in Washington and New York were conspiring to discredit
him as he prepared to run for the U.S. Senate, while Hillary Rodham
Clinton suggested that Giuliani was consumed by an anger that could
undercut his effectiveness in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady and the mayor made their remarks at almost
precisely the same moment, though in different parts of the state
and without knowledge of what the other was saying.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bronx, Giuliani contended that Democrats acting at Mrs.
Clinton's behest were waging an orchestrated campaign to damage his
candidacy, taking note of an investigation by the Brooklyn district
attorney into his chief political adviser, Bruce Teitelbaum, and
the federal takeover of a $60 million city homeless program ordered
by Andrew Cuomo, the secretary of housing and urban development.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are all involved in politics,'' Giuliani declared at a
groundbreaking in Hunts Point. ``They are all thinking about how
they can help Al Gore, Hillary Clinton. I wish they would stop it.
It actually is silly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to be like living on Mars not to figure out what's
going on,'' he said. ``This is Clinton politics come to New York.
It's what they used to do in Arkansas.''
</P>
<P>
   In Syracuse, Mrs. Clinton went from packing Salvation Army
holiday food bags for poor families to a news conference in which
she described Giuliani as someone who was ``getting angry all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time Mrs. Clinton has raised what her aides
have advised her to make a central thrust of her campaign against
Giuliani, and she swiftly offered up the criticism when she was
asked her views on whether Cuomo had been politically motivated in
acting against the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it made the mayor angry,'' Mrs. Clinton said, smiling
broadly as she ratcheted her candidacy up to a new level. ``But you
know, the mayor always gets angered about things that go on, and I
think we ought to keep our focus on what is the best way to deliver
the services that people in need in New York City require.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have anything to add, other than I can't be responding
every time the mayor gets angry,'' she said. ``Because that's all I
would do.''
</P>
<P>
   But a moment later, in response to a question by a reporter,
Mrs. Clinton suggested that Giuliani's style would be problematic
in the U.S. Senate, as she previewed what is likely to be one of
her campaign's dominant themes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go to the United States Senate, you are one of 100,''
she said. ``If they don't vote for the position you want them vote
for, you can't fire them, you can't go out and hire yourself some
new senators from somewhere else in the country. You have to work
with them.''
</P>
<P>
   The comments of the two prospective candidates came on a brisk
winter day three days before Christmas, but sounded in tone and
intensity like the kind of charge-and-counter-charge that might be
expected three days before Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   For Giuliani, it was a day to display his hardest-hitting
campaign style, as he shifted from attacks on Cuomo to Mrs. Clinton
to Charles J. Hynes, the Brooklyn district attorney, to the media.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the day clearly marked a new phase in Mrs.
Clinton's voyage from being a first lady to being a candidate in
New York. As such, it might serve to calm the concerns of some
Democrats worried that she does not have the stomach for the kind
of political brawling that seems inevitable in the contest to
replace Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the Democrat who is retiring.
</P>
<P>
   And the first lady, facing a new round of questions about her
fund-raising practices, sought to gain the offensive by declaring
that she was prepared to renounce the use of so-called soft-money,
the largely unregulated campaign contributions that have already
played a prominent role in Clinton fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not unilaterally do that,'' she said. ``But I would
certainly entertain a complete agreement on the part of any
opponents in my race that everyone would avoid the use of soft
money and not permit any independent expenditures on a candidates'
behalf.''
</P>
<P>
   But Teitelbaum dismissed Mrs. Clinton's statement as a gimmick.
``The continued stories about abuses of the campaign finance law
and the Clintons' use of soft money is obviously a concern and this
is an attempt to head off the damage of further revelations that
will likely surface,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's remarks about Democratic efforts against him were in
response to two events that have buffeted City Hall. The first is
an investigation by Hynes, the Democratic district attorney of
Brooklyn, into whether Teitelbaum, when he served as Giuliani's
chief of staff, improperly intervened to help Orthodox Jewish
supporters in Brooklyn who were involved in a dispute with the
city's Buildings Department.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani called on Hynes to drop the investigation, describing
it as specious and unfair. Kevin Davitt, a spokesman for Hynes,
rejected the request. ``Absolutely not,'' Davitt said. ``It goes
forward. Despite the mayor's best wishes.''
</P>
<P>
   The second event was the announcement on Tuesday by Cuomo, a
Democrat who is one of Mrs. Clinton's top unofficial advisers, that
HUD was taking over control of homeless service grants that had
been administered by the city. Cuomo said he acted in response to a
federal court ruling that found that City Hall had improperly
blocked an AIDS service organization from receiving funds.
</P>
<P>
   But as he made that announcement, Cuomo affirmed his support for
Mrs. Clinton in the Senate race, in a remark that some of Mrs.
Clinton's supporters described on Wednesday as troublesome, because
it allowed Giuliani to discredit Cuomo's criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo was unavailable to comment on Giuliani's statements, an
aide said on Wednesday. But Mrs. Clinton disputed any suggestion
that Cuomo had acted politically. ``To me, the judge in the case is
the one who made the point the mayor has engaged in retaliatory
action, and there has been a conscious decision on the part of the
mayor's office to take away funding from some groups for political
purposes,'' she said.

HOW ``THE GRINCH'' GAVE CHRISTMAS TO ONE LITTLE BOY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is one ironclad, cannot-be-broken rule about Christmas in
my house:
</P>
<P>
   ``How the Grinch Stole Christmas!'' must be watched _ twice, if
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Frosty? Sure. The Scrooge? OK. Pick a version of it and get back
to me. ``A Christmas Story?'' Definitely. A football game? Dandy.
Knock yourself out;_ put on those thick comfy socks and a big ol'
comfy sweater, wrap the blanket around you (or, if you're fortunate
enough, you and your sweetie), top off the eggnog and kick back. I
understand.
</P>
<P>
   But I gots to have my Grinch. And poor little Max, with the
antlers tied to his head. And Cindy-Lou Who, asking ``Why Santy?
Why?'' And that moment when the Grinch realizes the errors of his
ways and hoists _ ``with the strength of 10 Grinches, plus two!'' _
the sleigh holding all the Whos' presents atop his shoulders and
his heart grows three times and he rides pell-mell down the side of
Mount Crumpit and goes from cad to cool daddy.
</P>
<P>
   Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, THIS is Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   I accept no substitutes.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this is because the TV adaptation of the classic 1957
Dr. Seuss book debuted in 1966, when I was 4. I saw it that first
year, or the next, and immediately fell in love _ not because I
loved Dr. Seuss (well, what child didn't?), but because it was a
rollicking good tale, the songs were fun and great to sing along
to. How can one resist a phrase like ``seasick crocodile,'' after
all? And at the end, everybody is happy and getting presents and
eating roast beast, which sounded good to a chubby little carnivore
like myself.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the Grinch came to represent Christmas to me _
not as much as getting to see the grandparents or acquiring more
free swag from the parents, naturally, but certainly more than
anything else on the tube. Living in Michigan, I just felt sorry
for those poor souls I saw shivering through Christmas parades. As
for football, well, it was great, but by the time the game was on I
was stuffed and sleepy and didn't much care who won or lost.
</P>
<P>
   So it was the Grinch who rocked my yuletide world. Thinking back
on it now, I can see myself sitting on our couch in front of the
TV, Dad in his La-Z-Boy to my right, Mom next to me. The tree is
set up, the lights glowing and flickering, and outside the big
front window there is snow swirling and a silent tableau of winter,
our lawn a smooth blue-white blanket.
</P>
<P>
   My dog, Finnegan, a St. Bernard as sweet as he is large and
prone to drooling on every available surface, is sitting on the
floor, having positioned himself so that his head and ears are
within easy reach for scratching. I no doubt have just come in from
a day of sledding or skating or both, and I am perfectly warm and
comfortable and secure.
</P>
<P>
   And what, plopped down in this Hallmark scene, am I watching?
Disgust, cunning, thievery and deceit on a grand scale and,
finally, redemption. ``Grinch'' is an uplifting tale, no question,
but perhaps the most interesting part of it is that we don't know
why this guy is so angry at the Whos, why he's up there on that
mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Was it a broken love affair? Being cast out of the societal unit
for general unpleasantness and bad teeth? Was he exiled by the Mob?
What?
</P>
<P>
   People compare the Grinch with Scrooge, and that's fair _ but
also beside the point. With Scrooge, the back story (how he came to
be such a, well, such a Grinch) IS the story: We can understand why
he has turned his back on everyone and turned inward.
</P>
<P>
   The Grinch has no back story; he's a man without a country or a
life or a history. Oh, we know he hates Christmas and the noise the
Whos make, and he isn't a big fan of roast beast, but that's
precious little to go on. What's his deal?
</P>
<P>
   Ask a little boy that, and you've created a monster. I thought
up all sorts of scenarios for the Grinch's lonely exile on the top
of the mountain and always wondered how he could stay warm up there
and where he got food. If things got really tight, would he eat
Max? And for that matter, why was Max _ a dog who clearly loved
Christmas _ up there with him? Had Max been kidnapped?
</P>
<P>
   There were no answers, which was at least part of the reason I
loved the show so much. ``The Grinch'' didn't declare; it suggested
and insinuated, which is always more fun. At the same time, what
most appealed was the knowledge that love would triumph over hate
and everyone would get their presents and the Grinch might someday
move down off that mountain and everyone would be friends, which
was important to me when I was 7 or 8.
</P>
<P>
   This was a good thing to believe at that age, and I believed it
_ believed it in the face of all the problems coming out of
Detroit, in the face of the body counts from Vietnam, in the face
of the riots and confrontations constantly on television. The
world, it seemed to me in 1968 and '69 and '70, had gone mad, or
maybe was always mad (I had nothing to compare the present with,
after all) and here, for one half-hour each year, was love
triumphing over hate.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't have articulated this back then, but I knew it in my
bones. A bad man becomes good, and everyone is happy. Cool!
</P>
<P>
   It was a good reminder of the innate goodness of people and the
season. I wanted my presents, don't get me wrong, but the gentle
message would always stick with me and help me remember that
friends and relatives really do matter.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't realize until years later what an amazing collaboration
``Grinch'' was: The Dr. Seuss book, which came out in 1957, told
the tale well enough, but it was the collaboration of Ted Geisel
and master animator Chuck Jones (and the music of Eugene Poddany,
and Boris Karloff's narration, and all the rest) that made it what
it was: Jones made the Grinch green and his eyes a sickly yellow
and the two, together, fleshed the story out. Karloff's narration
is tale-telling at its finest. The whole package works as a
morality tale and a rollicking good cartoon and a Christmas fable.
</P>
<P>
   I wouldn't understand all this for years, but when I did it made
viewing ``The Grinch'' even more of a once-a-year treat.
</P>
<P>
   It became a talisman of sorts, an unchanging sweetness that
called to mind what was a very safe, happy childhood indeed. Which
is perhaps why I never went in for Grinch coffee mugs and the rest.
The Grinch is not mine, of course, but the story and the experience
of watching the show are part of my celebration of the season and
part of the reason that even during my most obnoxious and cynical
teen-age years I always watched. And always will. Christmas Day is
within our grasp, as long as we have hands to clasp. Amen to that.

ANOTHER BOSTON SPORTS ICON FALLS TO PROGRESS

 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A security guard had been on watch since Tuesday, the
parquet being under a 24-hour watch. World-famous, you know, just
as the Celtics' name if not the Celtics' team these days.
</P>
<P>
   The security guard was leaning against stacks of new parquet,
all crated so nicely and crisply, but his eyes were on the old
parquet only feet away . . . the dingy parquet, the precious
parquet, stacked as always, slivers and bolts protruding
haphazardly.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night was turning into the wee hours of Wednesday
morning. And now the parquet was being lifted for its final trip,
out onto the floor, the A sections (A-1, A-2, A-3) being laid first
far down on on the west end of the FleetCenter, and then the B
sections and the C sections and on and on, all 264 pieces of the
sacred parquet.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the pieces, 5 feet by 5 feet. Pieces of maple, say some.
Pieces of oak, say others.
</P>
<P>
   (Truth is not easy to come by when it comes to the parquet
floor. Legends abound. Tales expand.)
</P>
<P>
   But pieces of Boston sports history, say all.
</P>
<P>
   Forklifts grabbed sections and whooshed away, pieces of
cardboard sticking out from the slabs of parquet _ old cardboard,
mind you, very old cardboard _ protecting one piece from the one
atop of it. This was all happening in a back area of the
FleetCenter, a desolate back area. A visitor walked by and peeled
off a sliver of wood from the G-2 section of parquet _ the foul
line for the east end was stacked right next to it. Slivers were
easy to come by.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people get really psyched up about all this,'' said Steve
Shannon of Malden, who's been hauling the parquet around for 10 or
so years now. ``But I'm not one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   No sentiment? No emotion? ``Yeahhh . . . I guess there's a lot
of history involved and stuff but . . . I'm not going to stand out
there and get all emotional about it,'' said Shannon. ``It's just a
floor . . . that's all . . . a floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Forklifts were whistling about, horns honking, so the subtle
nuances of history were hard to discern. But, out on the arena
floor, were the men of the bull gang, the ones who touch the
parquet scores of times a year, the men most close to the wood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nah, I'm not going to miss it,'' said a gravelly voice, the
voice of Charlie Gravell of Everett, who was standing where
midcourt would be in an hour or so, more or less overseeing the
bull gang place the parquet into place for the last time. ``It's
about time they got a new floor here.''
</P>
<P>
   Gravell has been with the bull gang since 1958, like so many of
the others who started first as a part-timer and then moved up to
full-time duty. ``Forty-one years is a long time with the floor,''
Gravell conceded, and he is the senior parquet-handler.
</P>
<P>
   No tears shed for the last time? ``Not me.''
</P>
<P>
   None? ``We needed a new floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Anything you're going to miss about the parquet? ``Yeah . . .
it's easy to put down. The new one's going to be harder.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now, it was early Wednesday morning and any evidence the Bruins
had been on the ice a few hours earlier was gone. Pieces of common,
everyday wood had been laid over the ice and the parquet _ piece by
piece _ was placed over the wood. The job takes about two hours
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never lost a piece,'' said Gravell, now 61. ``But some
pieces were broke . . . you know, people tried to steal it. The
only time I ever saw a piece break was during a high school
tournament . . . the piece broke right in the center, halfway up,
right during the game. We had to take it up and put a new piece
in.''
</P>
<P>
   The old myths that a sneaker could get lost in the holes in the
parquet are just that to Gravell _ myths. ``That's what they say,''
he said. ``But you're going to have a gap between the pieces anyway
. . . you can't put 'em tight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``.''Gravell added yet another voice to the revisionists who
swear this parquet floor is not the original parquet, but one that
was put in place during the early 1950s after the original had been
brought over from the Boston Arena, where the Celtics first played.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Bob) Cousy didn't like the other floor,'' said Gravell. The
parquet of the original floor was much thinner ``and about 8 feet
long,'' said Gravell. ``But Cousy didn't like it, so they took it
out and brought this one in.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins game had been over for some two hours. By now the
parquet had been laid out to the foul line extended on the east end
and Ed D'Onofrio was standing by a stack of parquet out near
midcourt. ``I'm the cardboard guy,'' said D'Onofrio.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, D'Ononfrio would whip away the protective piece of
elderly cardboard each time other bull gangers lugged away a piece
of elderly parquet. ``I've done everything,'' said D'Onofrio, also
of Everett, ``but since I'm the oldest one (63), I get to do
this.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More time passed. The parquet expanded. As men lugged a piece
from a forklift and put it in place, Al Fiore walked by with a long
screwdriver and aligned the bolts that fasten the board to its
adjoining piece.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years I've been on this floor,'' said Fiore.
</P>
<P>
   Any tears about leaving it? ``Nahh . . . except it's going to
take double the work with the new floor.''
</P>
<P>
   No attachment at all? ``Well, if we were still in the old
building . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Where the parquet was as much Boston Garden as the second
balcony. But this is the FleetCenter and the security guard was
still guarding the last pieces of parquet as the hours turned more
wee. Staring at a floor for hours can be . . . well, boring so,
from time to time, Mark Petit-ma would bring a soft drink to the
guard, whose eyes never left the parquet.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
MAJOR MOMENTS IN PARQUET HISTORY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Cousy's free throws: Bob Cousy hits 30 of 32 free throws
while playing 66 minutes as the Celtics win their first postseason
series with a 111-105 victory over Syracuse in four overtimes March
21, 1953. Cousy also hit a 30-footer at the buzzer of the third OT
to tie it again at 99. &QL; 
 &QL; 
2. ``Havlicek stole the ball'': John Havlicek grabs Hal Greer's
inbounds pass intended for Chet Walker, enabling the Celtics to
defeat the Philadelphia 76ers, 110-109, in Game 7 of the Eastern
Division finals, April 15, 1965. &QL; 
 &QL; 
3. Selvy's missed shot: Lakers guard Frank Selvy fails to hit an
open 12-foot, baseline jumper at the end of regulation, and the
Celtics go on to win Game 7 in overtime, 110-107, for their fifth
NBA title, April 18, 1962. &QL; 
 &QL; 
4. Jordan's 63-point game: Michael Jordan dunks over Kevin McHale
for 2 of his playoff-record 63 points in Chicago's 135-131
double-overtime loss to the Celtics in Game 2 of their Eastern
Conference first-round series, April 20, 1986. &QL; 
 &QL; 
5. Tree bites man: In the midst of a bench-clearing fight in Game 3
of their first-round playoff series, April 24, 1983, Atlanta's Tree
Rollins bites Danny Ainge's finger. Rollins is fined $5,000 and
suspended for five games. &QL; 
 &QL; 
6. Lewis collapses: Reggie Lewis falls to the floor with 6:26 left
in the first quarter against Charlotte April 29, 1993. He returns
in the third quarter, but leaves again with 5:45 left in the third.
He dies three months later. &QL; 
 &QL; 
7. Bird switche: In a 98-95 victory over Houston in Game 1
of the NBA Finals May 5, 1981, Larry Bird hits one of his most
famous shots _ a flying follow of his own miss that he converts by
switching from his right hand to left hand in midair, with his
momentum carrying him out of bounds. &QL;

GM AND FORD ARE EXPECCOMPETE FOR DAEWOO MOTOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SAMUEL LEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ Daewoo Motor Co. became the object of a
potential bidding brawl between the world's two largest automakers
Wednesday after the South Korean government decided to solicit
offers instead of negotiate with a single buyer.
</P>
<P>
   The government, which is overseeing Daewoo Motor's sale as part
of a broader dismantling of the Daewoo Group, the insolvent
conglomerate, decided to auction the automaker after Ford Motor Co.
expressed interest in buying it. Earlier, the government had
indicated it might bargain exclusively with General Motors Corp.,
which said last week that it wanted to buy Daewoo Motor.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how much buyers ultimately would be willing to pay
for Daewoo Motor, which carries more than $16 billion of Daewoo
Group's estimated $78 billion in debts. But GM reportedly had
offered as much as $7 billion for Daewoo Motor's assets, and the
assumption of an unspecified amount of the debt.
</P>
<P>
   For both Ford and GM, the acquisition of Daewoo Motor would
offer an instant expansion of their manufacturing and marketing in
Asia, which has rebounded from a 1997 economic crisis and is now
considered a most promising region for increased vehicle sales.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Financial Supervisory Commission, the government agency
responsible for the sale of Daewoo Motor, said it would ``take
place through a method where an investor with the best advantages,
selected from their letters of intent, will be given exclusive
negotiating rights.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   GM declined to comment on the government's decision, but it is
clearly a setback for the automaker, which had hoped to reach a
deal without rival interference by negotiating an exclusive
contract quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Ford said it intended to step up negotiations with Daewoo
Motor's South Korean creditors. Jim Bright, a Ford Motor spokesman
in Detroit, said that Paul Drenkow, a senior Ford manager in the
Asia-Pacific region, would lead a group meeting in early January
with Daewoo Motor's main creditor, Korea Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Projected growth in the global auto industry is going to occur
in other places than in North America and Europe, and most of that
growth is going to occur in Asia,'' Bright said. ``We're definitely
interested in Daewoo Motor.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ford and GM have jostled before in trying to acquire a South
Korean automaker. When Ford began a serious bid for Kia Motor
Corp., GM flirted briefly with that bankrupt company until Hyundai
Motor Co. beat Ford in October 1998.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea has spent the last year recovering from the Asian
economic crisis and car sales this year have doubled since the peak
of the recession in 1998, nearly catching up with levels seen just
before the crisis began in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Combined domestic and overseas car sales by Daewoo, Hyundai and
Kia totaled more than 300,000 vehicles last month. Ranked by
automobile sales, South Korea is second only to Japan in the Asian
market.

ITALY'S SEMI-NEW GOVERNMENT, 57TH SINCE THE WAR, IS SWORN IN 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Acting Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema presented a new,
lightly shuffled cabinet Wednesday that mostly underscored the
fierce infighting within his center-left majority that forced him
to resign on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema's new government _ Italy's 57th since World War II _
discarded ministers affiliated with three small parties that
mutinied last week. He replaced them with two representatives of
the Democrats Party, which was founded by his predecessor, Roman
Prodi, and had been demanding more of a voice since it won 7.7
percent of the vote in the elections in June for the European
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The key members of D'Alema's team, including Foreign Minister
Lamberto Dini, Treasury Minister Giuliano Amato and Economics
Minister Vincenzo Visco, remained in place.
</P>
<P>
   But Carlo Scognamiglio was replaced as defense minister by
Sergio Mattarella, a member of the Italian Popular Party, the
largest centrist party loyal to D'Alema.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema and his ministers were sworn in Wednesday morning by
President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, but the new team still needs to be
approved by the Italian Parliament in a vote of confidence. The
Senate approved the cabinet Wednesday night. The lower house is
expected to vote on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   When D'Alema resigned on Saturday, he said he did so to create a
``stronger, more stable'' government that could last until
parliamentary elections in 2001. But even if his government is
narrowly approved, as is likely, it is bound to remain vulnerable
to stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian political system, which still awards seats to even
tiny parties on the basis of their shares of the national vote, is
inherently fragile. D'Alema's majority, moreover, stretches
uncomfortably across the ideological spectrum, including Communists
but also centrists who, on many issues, lean right. Disputes over
issues like the budget and Kosovo caused Prodi to fall by one vote
in October 1998.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema has made electoral reform a key goal, saying a two-party
system would give Italy the political stability it sorely lacks.
Earlier this week, he held meetings with the three small parties,
known as the Clover Alliance, whose rebellion had forced his
resignation. But he was unable to convince them to support his plan
for electoral reform.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema wants to do away with proportional representation, but
that would in effect wipe out the small parties. ``The country is
looking ahead, while politics is struggling to turn over a new
leaf,'' he told Parliament on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema wants to complete formation of his new government by
Saturday, and the selection process was so speedy that some new
cabinet ministers found out about their new positions only when
they were announced on television.

HOW ``THE GRINCH'' GAVE CHRISTMAS TO ONE LITTLE BOY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is one ironclad, cannot-be-broken rule about Christmas in
my house:
</P>
<P>
   ``How the Grinch Stole Christmas!'' must be watched _ twice, if
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Frosty? Sure. The Scrooge? OK. Pick a version of it and get back
to me. ``A Christmas Story?'' Definitely. A football game? Dandy.
Knock yourself out;_ put on those thick comfy socks and a big ol'
comfy sweater, wrap the blanket around you (or, if you're fortunate
enough, you and your sweetie), top off the eggnog and kick back. I
understand.
</P>
<P>
   But I gots to have my Grinch. And poor little Max, with the
antlers tied to his head. And Cindy-Lou Who, asking ``Why Santy?
Why?'' And that moment when the Grinch realizes the errors of his
ways and hoists _ ``with the strength of 10 Grinches, plus two!'' _
the sleigh holding all the Whos' presents atop his shoulders and
his heart grows three times and he rides pell-mell down the side of
Mount Crumpit and goes from cad to cool daddy.
</P>
<P>
   Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, THIS is Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   I accept no substitutes.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this is because the TV adaptation of the classic 1957
Dr. Seuss book debuted in 1966, when I was 4. I saw it that first
year, or the next, and immediately fell in love _ not because I
loved Dr. Seuss (well, what child didn't?), but because it was a
rollicking good tale, the songs were fun and great to sing along
to. How can one resist a phrase like ``seasick crocodile,'' after
all? And at the end, everybody is happy and getting presents and
eating roast beast, which sounded good to a chubby little carnivore
like myself.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the Grinch came to represent Christmas to me _
not as much as getting to see the grandparents or acquiring more
free swag from the parents, naturally, but certainly more than
anything else on the tube. Living in Michigan, I just felt sorry
for those poor souls I saw shivering through Christmas parades. As
for football, well, it was great, but by the time the game was on I
was stuffed and sleepy and didn't much care who won or lost.
</P>
<P>
   So it was the Grinch who rocked my yuletide world. Thinking back
on it now, I can see myself sitting on our couch in front of the
TV, Dad in his La-Z-Boy to my right, Mom next to me. The tree is
set up, the lights glowing and flickering, and outside the big
front window there is snow swirling and a silent tableau of winter,
our lawn a smooth blue-white blanket.
</P>
<P>
   My dog, Finnegan, a St. Bernard as sweet as he is large and
prone to drooling on every available surface, is sitting on the
floor, having positioned himself so that his head and ears are
within easy reach for scratching. I no doubt have just come in from
a day of sledding or skating or both, and I am perfectly warm and
comfortable and secure.
</P>
<P>
   And what, plopped down in this Hallmark scene, am I watching?
Disgust, cunning, thievery and deceit on a grand scale and,
finally, redemption. ``Grinch'' is an uplifting tale, no question,
but perhaps the most interesting part of it is that we don't know
why this guy is so angry at the Whos, why he's up there on that
mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Was it a broken love affair? Being cast out of the societal unit
for general unpleasantness and bad teeth? Was he exiled by the Mob?
What?
</P>
<P>
   People compare the Grinch with Scrooge, and that's fair _ but
also beside the point. With Scrooge, the back story (how he came to
be such a, well, such a Grinch) IS the story: We can understand why
he has turned his back on everyone and turned inward.
</P>
<P>
   The Grinch has no back story; he's a man without a country or a
life or a history. Oh, we know he hates Christmas and the noise the
Whos make, and he isn't a big fan of roast beast, but that's
precious little to go on. What's his deal?
</P>
<P>
   Ask a little boy that, and you've created a monster. I thought
up all sorts of scenarios for the Grinch's lonely exile on the top
of the mountain and always wondered how he could stay warm up there
and where he got food. If things got really tight, would he eat
Max? And for that matter, why was Max _ a dog who clearly loved
Christmas _ up there with him? Had Max been kidnapped?
</P>
<P>
   There were no answers, which was at least part of the reason I
loved the show so much. ``The Grinch'' didn't declare; it suggested
and insinuated, which is always more fun. At the same time, what
most appealed was the knowledge that love would triumph over hate
and everyone would get their presents and the Grinch might someday
move down off that mountain and everyone would be friends, which
was important to me when I was 7 or 8.
</P>
<P>
   This was a good thing to believe at that age, and I believed it
_ believed it in the face of all the problems coming out of
Detroit, in the face of the body counts from Vietnam, in the face
of the riots and confrontations constantly on television. The
world, it seemed to me in 1968 and '69 and '70, had gone mad, or
maybe was always mad (I had nothing to compare the present with,
after all) and here, for one half-hour each year, was love
triumphing over hate.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't have articulated this back then, but I knew it in my
bones. A bad man becomes good, and everyone is happy. Cool!
</P>
<P>
   It was a good reminder of the innate goodness of people and the
season. I wanted my presents, don't get me wrong, but the gentle
message would always stick with me and help me remember that
friends and relatives really do matter.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't realize until years later what an amazing collaboration
``Grinch'' was: The Dr. Seuss book, which came out in 1957, told
the tale well enough, but it was the collaboration of Ted Geisel
and master animator Chuck Jones (and the music of Eugene Poddany,
and Boris Karloff's narration, and all the rest) that made it what
it was: Jones made the Grinch green and his eyes a sickly yellow
and the two, together, fleshed the story out. Karloff's narration
is tale-telling at its finest. The whole package works as a
morality tale and a rollicking good cartoon and a Christmas fable.
</P>
<P>
   I wouldn't understand all this for years, but when I did it made
viewing ``The Grinch'' even more of a once-a-year treat.
</P>
<P>
   It became a talisman of sorts, an unchanging sweetness that
called to mind what was a very safe, happy childhood indeed. Which
is perhaps why I never went in for Grinch coffee mugs and the rest.
The Grinch is not mine, of course, but the story and the experience
of watching the show are part of my celebration of the season and
part of the reason that even during my most obnoxious and cynical
teen-age years I always watched. And always will. Christmas Day is
within our grasp, as long as we have hands to clasp. Amen to that.

 &HT;    Braves acquire leadoff hitter
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On a distracting day, the Atlanta Braves quietly
morphed into something new Wednesday. Again.
</P>
<P>
   In a major deal that alters the club's offensive profile, the
Braves addressed their clearest deficiency, acquiring from San
Diego second baseman and leadoff hitter Quilvio Veras and
outfielder Reggie Sanders. The deal, rumored for weeks, was
expanded to include Wally Joyner, an Atlanta native who serves as
insurance against the cancer recovery of first baseman Andres
Galarraga.
</P>
<P>
   The cost _ second baseman Bret Boone, lifetime Brave Ryan Klesko
and pitching prospect Jason Shiell _ wasn't cheap. But the club,
diminished at the top of the order by losing free-agent outfielder
Gerald Williams, added a prototypical leadoff hitter in Veras.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt it was essential that we improve the upper part of our
lineup,'' general manager John Schuerholz said, ``and with the
acquisition of Sanders and Veras, who between them stole 66 bases
and scored a lot of runs (187) ... it provides us with a much
better opportunity to create and produce runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta saved money, sending nearly $15 million in payroll
obligation to San Diego for just over $10 million (Sanders at $3.7
million, Joyner at $3.375 million and Veras worth an approximate $3
million through arbitration). The finances fueled speculation that
Klesko, due nearly $11 million the next two seasons, might not last
long as a Padre.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know if it's one of these deals where you get traded
and the next thing you know, the next day you're traded again to
another team,'' said Klesko, who hit .297 with 21 homers and 80
RBIs last season.
</P>
<P>
   Veras, who missed 30 games due in part to leg trouble last
season, had a .377 on-base percentage, 42 points higher than
Williams. Boone, an All-Star two years ago, lasted just one year in
Atlanta (.252, career-high 112 strikeouts), though his desire to
leave the club was exaggerated in the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't ask for the trade,'' he said. ``I ended up not asking
for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves will have one of the game's tightest outfields _
Sanders in left, Andruw Jones in center and Brian Jordan in right.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ought to be able to cover two or three sections of foul
territory in left field and two or three sections in right field,''
Schuerholz said.

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas is counting on a
small group of conservative experts steeped in the intricacies of
arms control, military budgets and geopolitical security to counsel
him on a subject that has caused him the most trouble in his
presidential campaign: foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The task of helping Bush translate his core principles for
America's role in the world into concrete policies lies largely in
the hands of eight hawkish advisers with broad experience under
President Ronald Reagan or Bush's father, President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Like Reagan when he ran for president, Gov. Bush has no broad
foreign policy experience. But unlike Reagan, who had a long
history of preaching against communism, Bush has no similar guiding
philosophy. As a result, his foreign policy stumbles, like flubbing
a pop quiz on world leaders, have only amplified the role his
advisers play.
</P>
<P>
   After months of briefings and informal discussions, the
advisers' influence over Bush has become more evident with every
speech, news conference and debate. Perhaps even more than the
other candidates, it is not unusual to hear the advisers' words
coming out of Bush's mouth.
</P>
<P>
   This kitchen cabinet is a tight-knit, strong-willed group led by
Condoleezza Rice, a Russia specialist in President Bush's National
Security Council, and Paul D. Wolfowitz, a senior Pentagon official
in the Bush administration and former ambassador to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also consults with two unofficial senior advisers, Richard
B. Cheney, President Bush's secretary of defense, and George P.
Shultz, Reagan's secretary of state. Conspicuously absent is the
elder Bush, who has not sought a foreign policy role, largely to
give his son a degree of independence, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the advisers have known each other for more than a
decade, forging close ties as Cold Warriors combatting the Soviet
Union, as mediators helping to reunify Germany, or as Pentagon
strategists leading the allied victory over Iraq in the 1991
Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers bristle at the notion that they are tutoring a novice.
They argue that Bush surprised them by articulating a set of broad
foreign policy principles and priorities _ from missile defenses to
free trade to what he calls The Big Ones: Russia, China and India
_that need refining, not revamping.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this drill has involved is fleshing out the sense he has
about things, rather than introducing things he didn't know
anything about,'' said Dov S. Zakheim, a former deputy under
secretary of defense for Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's words have a familiar ring, at times echoing his
advisers' public pronouncements as well as their private counsel
given in hours of free-wheeling, rapid-fire discussions in
conference calls and in meetings at the governor's mansion here
over the last year. Advisers say he has yet to overrule them on any
major issue.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In August, for example, Ms. Rice, the governor's top foreign
policy adviser, described to The National Journal how a future Bush
administration would curtail the Clinton administration's penchant
for dispatching troops on far-flung humanitarian or peacekeeping
missions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would be more selective in our military involvements,'' she
said. ``One downside of having this extraordinary power, relative
to the rest of the world, is that you can easily become
overextended. That risks erosion of domestic support for America's
global role and international resentment of what many see as an
arrogant and reckless power.''
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks later, in Bush's defense policy speech on Sept. 23, he
issued a similar warning: ``We must be selective in the use of our
military, precisely because America has other great
responsibilities that cannot be slighted or compromised.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Several advisers, including Richard Perle, an assistant
secretary of defense under Reagan, have advocated that the United
States withdraw from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty if
Russia refuses to negotiate changes that would allow both countries
to field national systems to protect against limited long-range
missile attacks. The governor heartily embraced that position.
</P>
<P>
   Bush rarely has to choose between stark divisions in his
advisers. Last spring, his aides split over whether the United
States should support NATO military action to protect Kosovar
Albanians. Zakheim publicly opposed it. Wolfowitz supported it.
Bush reluctantly backed President Clinton's decision to intervene,
persuaded that broader European interests were at stake.
</P>
<P>
   His aides insist that they are often reinforcing and fine-tuning
Bush's gut instincts, making it difficult to single out any one
adviser's influence. ``It's like making sausage,'' Ms. Rice said in
an interview at Bush campaign headquarters here. ``We get in there,
slog through together, and ideas emerge.''
</P>
<P>
   The foreign policy team members, who call themselves the
Vulcans, after a statue of the Roman god of fire and metalworking
in Birmingham, Ala., Ms. Rice's hometown, sprang from a meeting in
August 1998 that President Bush set up at his summer residence in
Kennebunkport, Maine, between his son and Ms. Rice.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few months, Ms. Rice, who stepped down in June as
provost of Stanford University, agreed to head the governor's
foreign policy team. Together with Wolfowitz, she chose a seasoned
cadre of experts who, like Bush, champion internationalism, voice a
tougher security approach to dealing with China and Russia, and
promise an overhaul of Pentagon spending and strategy.
</P>
<P>
   But surprisingly for a candidate who preaches the virtues of the
global marketplace, Bush's foreign policy team has only one expert
in international economics _ Robert B. Zoellick, an undersecretary
of state in the Bush administration _ and no specialists in Africa
or Latin America. The campaign has a separate team of economic
aides, with whom Ms. Rice and Zoellick coordinate.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a weakness in the team, it's that it's heavy on
security issues,'' acknowledged Ms. Rice, who said she was seeking
to diversify the group.
</P>
<P>
   In their dealings with Bush, the advisers rely on a familiar
working model. ``This operation runs a little bit like we'd run the
N.S.C., with the daily briefing he gets, making sure there's press
guidance, and worrying about speeches where your policy gets
honed,'' said Ms. Rice, who studied international relations at the
University of Denver under Josef Korbel, the father of Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in some ways, the most important thing in a campaign is to
try to keep focused on the fact that there are a lot of audiences
reading what you're saying, including foreign audiences, foreign
governments,'' Ms. Rice said.
</P>
<P>
   To keep that message sharp, the team has a routine. At nine
o'clock every Monday morning, the advisers hook up by phone from
across the country _ sometimes from overseas _ to swap diplomatic
gossip, dissect world events and polish Bush's approach to
international affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Each Sunday evening, Ms. Rice, Wolfowitz, Bush and a few other
top aides here hold a conference call to review global hotspots and
talk about issues that have caught the governor's eye. ``It's a
little bit more relaxed opportunity to discuss foreign policy, and
a chance for him to talk directly to us,'' said Ms. Rice, who
shuttles between here and Stanford, where she is a senior fellow at
the Hoover Institution.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rice periodically reaches outside the foreign policy brain
trust for insights. Gen. Colin L. Powell, the former chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has met with Bush and critiqued his
defense policy speech.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Coverdell, a Georgia Republican on the Foreign
Relations Committee who is Bush's point man in the Senate, briefed
the governor's top aides on Senate Republicans' strategy to oppose
a global treaty banning underground nuclear testing. The Senate
rejected the pact in October. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The musings of Bush's advisers are also important because they
give a glimpse into the people who will undoubtedly fill the top
ranks of the Pentagon, State Department and National Security
Council if he is elected.
</P>
<P>
   When tensions in Asia ran high last summer over the rejection by
Taiwan's president, Lee Teng-hui, of the longstanding ``one China''
formula, Richard L. Armitage, a senior Pentagon official in the
Reagan administration, caused a stir in Australia when he told The
Australian Financial Review that Australia ``must stand ready to
give military support to the U.S. if Washington goes to war with
China'' over Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Armitage emphasized that Washington did not want to go to war
with China, and that there was a low risk of conflict. But if a
misjudgment triggered fighting, he said the United States would
expect Australia to help with ``the dirty, hard and dangerous
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven J. Hadley, a Pentagon arms control expert in the Bush
administration, has spoken eloquently on linking changes in the
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty to reductions in the U.S. and Russian
nuclear stockpiles, bringing them well below the levels allowed
under the Start II treaty.
</P>
<P>
   In the Persian Gulf, Wolfowitz has not ruled out using U.S.
troops to support Iraqi insurgents in toppling Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will take American forces to create a protected area in
which opposition forces can organize and to which units from
Saddam's army can defect,'' Wolfowitz wrote in The New Republic in
December 1998. ``This policy is risky. But it is less risky than
the present course, which is leading us to the day that we are
obliged to face Saddam ourselves, when he is armed with weapons of
unparalleled destructiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his father or Clinton, Bush is not likely to immerse
himself in the arcana of policy, leaving more running room for his
advisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not a policy wonk and he never will be,'' Perle said.
``But he's going to convey a sense of who he is and how he'd
exercise authority.''

`TITUS' TURNS BARD'S PLAY INTO A VISUAL TREAT
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: EMBARGOED until Friday, Dec. 24. Fact box below) 
Our rating: 3 1/2 stars 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Titus,'' Julie Taymor's deliciously pulpy, gorgeously stylized
and darkly inspired retelling of Shakespeare's grand guignol
tragedy ``Titus Andronicus,'' is a movie that brings new meaning to
the phrase ``vicious circle.''
</P>
<P>
   By far the bloodiest and least performed of the Bard's early
works, the play provides an excruciating account of the grisly
cycle of retribution unleashed by a proud and stoic Roman general,
and concludes with an unceremoniously corpse-strewn stage.
</P>
<P>
   Taymor's film, as entertaining as it is visually stunning,
reinterprets Shakespeare's vision as a three-ring Fellini-esque
theater of cruelty laced with absurdist humor and haunting poetic
imagery. It thereby turns what might have been a gruesome failure
into one of the year's most ambitious successes.
</P>
<P>
   Pushing beyond the hip period updatings of the recent remake of
``A Midsummer Night's Dream'' or Baz Luhrmann's ``Shakespeare's
Romeo and Juliet,'' Taymor and her design team have fashioned a
fully postmodern Shakespeare adaptation, with a look that ranges
from Bronze Age chic to leather-pants punk. The excellent ensemble
cast, headed by Anthony Hopkins and Jessica Lange, also succeeds
against stiff odds, finding soulfulness and coherency in some of
Shakespeare's most repugnant and psychologically splintered rogues.
</P>
<P>
   Reviled and ignored for centuries, ``Titus Andronicus'' was
rediscovered after a landmark 1955 production at
Stratford-upon-Avon proved its enduring relevance to a planet
racked by two world wars.
</P>
<P>
   Yet although it's packed with the kind of lurid sensationalism
and meat-grinder aesthetics that might endear it to our own jaded
times, the play is still a tough sell. Rape, maiming, murder and
even cannibalism make up its almost surreal quotient of violence.
Vengeance and hate are served raw, without the mellowing tonic of
Hamlet's bitter eloquence or Lear's majestic madness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Titus,'' however, refuses to take the play's seemingly
nihilistic atrocities simply at face value. Diving headfirst where
most debut filmmakers might fear to paddle, Taymor, whose career
encompasses opera, avant-garde theater and Disney's stage version
of ``The Lion King,'' makes a persuasive case that ``Titus'' is, if
not a great play, then at least an unnervingly relevant one that
prefigures Shakespeare's greatest tragedies.
</P>
<P>
   Deploying a visual style that's both emotionally symphonic and
intensely cinematic, Taymor brackets her film with a theatrical
prologue in which a young boy stages a vicious kitchen-table battle
with his toy action figures.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the make-believe war reaches its ketchup-spurting
climax, a bomb hits the room, plunging the boy down a tunnel and
directly into Shakespeare's story. Gradually, the boy metamorphoses
into one of the play's characters as well as the audience's
metaphorical stand-in.
</P>
<P>
   Neither more nor less brutal than most men of his station, Titus
(Hopkins) is a by-the-book professional warrior recently returned
from conquering the Goths and enslaving their rebel queen Tamora
(the tigresslike Lange) and her three feral sons, one of whom Titus
immediately sacrifices to appease the Roman gods.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, no good will come of this. By ignoring Tamora's plea
that ``sweet mercy is nobility's true badge,'' Titus unleashes
Tamora's own formidable blood lust.
</P>
<P>
   And when the Roman emperor-elect Saturninus (amusingly played by
Alan Cumming as a world-weary brat) picks Tamora for his consort,
Titus and his four sons, daughter Lavinia (Laura Fraser) and
brother Marcus (Colm Feore) are soon banished from Rome, where
they're even more vulnerable to Tamora's machinations and those of
her surviving sons (Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Matthew Rhys) and
their fiendish ally Aaron the Moor (Harry Lennix).
</P>
<P>
   It says much about the film's robust artistry that Lennix makes
the Moor less the racist caricature of Shakespeare's text than an
exquisitely ambivalent character, capable of both remorseless
cruelty toward his foes and great tenderness toward his infant son.
Lennix's superb portrayal is of such pure, concentrated malice, it
may make you giddy.
</P>
<P>
   In a barely less off-putting role, Lange does some of her best
film work, while Hopkins' rich, intuitive performance makes sense
of the consummate man of war who has little aptitude for peace.
Segueing effortlessly from brutal to avuncular, the actor even
provides a lip-smacking bit of comic relief when he finds the
perfect occasion to evoke Hannibal Lecter.
</P>
<P>
   In the first of many well-conceived set pieces, Taymor stages
Titus' initial entry into the Roman coliseum as a mud-splattered
pageant of robotic soldiers driving motorcycles and war machines
that could've leapt from the pages of Leonardo Da Vinci's
notebooks. The movie deliberately blurs historical eras, mixing
animal skins and armor with 1930s evening wear that recalls the
sleekly erotic decadence of Visconti's ``The Damned.'' Ancient
Roman ruins jostle pointedly with monumental fascist architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Taymor also makes sensational use of brief, expressionistic
montages to illustrate themes that Shakespeare's text only hints
at. In this way, she and production designer Dante Ferretti and
costume designer Milena Canonero give the film a retro-futuristic
look and feel that emphasize its timelessness and universality. For
all its primitive exoticism, the savage terrain of ``Titus,'' like
so many of Shakespeare's worlds, is uncannily and disturbingly
contemporary. &QL;

ACROSS NATION,  HOMELESS BECOMING PREY FOR VIOLENT TEEN-AGERS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., Va., Wash., Texas, Calif., Ore., Ill., S.D.,
Alaska)   (rk) 
 By EVELYN NIEVES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Denver, five were pummeled to death and two more beheaded. In
Richmond, Va., one was beaten, stabbed and beheaded, his head then
carried nearly a mile and placed for display on a footbridge. In
Seattle, one was stabbed 18 times, another beaten bloody, then
stabbed.
</P>
<P>
   There were others. One in Dallas, pelted with bullets from a
12-gauge shotgun for rummaging through trash. One in Chico, Calif.,
beaten to death for begging for spare change. Three in Portland,
Ore., strangled for who knows what.
</P>
<P>
   They were all homeless people killed over the last year. And
these were just the killings that made the news. Exactly how many
homeless people have been victims of savage attacks is unknown.
Police departments do not tabulate crimes against homeless people,
and in many cases, such as several beatings that have frightened
the large homeless population in San Francisco, those who survive
attacks often do not report them.
</P>
<P>
   What appears certain, advocates for the homeless say, is that
living on the streets is becoming more dangerous. In the last few
years, police departments across the country have reported more
frequent, more vicious attacks on those who are homeless. Nearly
always, the victims are ambushed as they sleep. Nearly as often,
the suspects, who are not always caught, are described as young men
who appear to attack for no reason. In some cases, suspects call it
``bum-bashing'' or ``troll-busting,'' police and advocates for the
homeless say.
</P>
<P>
   Attacks against homeless people rarely get attention, but
nationally, violence against people who are unsheltered is becoming
so common that the National Coalition for the Homeless is asking
Congress to consider ``homeless people'' as a maligned minority, or
protected class, in drafting any new legislation against hate
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have always been isolated instances of homeless people
being set on fire,'' said Michael Stoops, a community organizer for
the National Coalition. ``But what we're seeing now is a trend. And
what's most disturbing is that the likely suspects continue to be
young people.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on news reports, the coalition has counted 29 homeless
people who were killed in 1999 in 11 cities, from San Francisco to
Richmond, Va. It listed six others who barely survived attacks. The
youngest suspects in these cases were 14 years old, and most were
under 21.
</P>
<P>
   No one can say for sure why young people in particular seem to
be attacking homeless people in increasing numbers. But looking at
arrests in cases of violence against homeless people over several
years, by far the majority of the suspects were young teen-agers,
or even pre-teen-age boys, who bragged about the attacks afterward.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, for example, a 14-year-old middle school student was
convicted in March in the death of a 50-year-old homeless man. The
youth struck the victim repeatedly with a skateboard, robbed him,
then stabbed him to death with a pocket knife. He was caught a week
later, when witnesses told police he had been boasting about
killing a ``bum.'' In that same city, three teen-agers were charged
in August with the murder of a 46-year-old homeless man as he tried
to sleep beneath an interstate overpass. Prosecutors said that one
told friends, ``Let's just say there's one less bum on the face of
the Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   John Urquhart, a spokesman for the King County sheriff's office,
which covers Seattle, said he believed that the homeless were
singled out probably because they are accessible, anonymous and
stigmatized as ``throwaways of society.''
</P>
<P>
   Many advocates for the homeless blame increasing crackdowns on
homeless people for sitting, sleeping or lying in public spaces as
a significant factor in the increased attacks.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, a homeless man was doused with a flammable chemical
and set aflame as he slept on a park bench in July. He suffered
third-degree burns over 20 percent of his body. John Donahue,
executive director of the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless, said
that he had noticed more of these kinds of attacks with the
increased gentrification of the city, the fencing of lower Wacker
Drive, where an encampment of homeless people had lived undisturbed
for years, and the increased police enforcement of laws designed to
keep people off the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the underpinning of these hate crimes,'' he said. ``It
legitimizes them because these people don't count. These people are
criminals for being poor _ that's what the official position is
saying about these people.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoops of the National Coalition said that when he visits high
schools and asks students what they think about homeless people,
they often call them bums and drunks who are too lazy to work.
``We're obviously sending a message to our young people that
homeless people are not worthy of their respect,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Denver, where the only suspects in a spate of seven slayings
since September are a 16-year-old, an 18-year-old and a 20-year-old
charged with murder for the death of one victim (and accused of the
nonfatal beatings of five other homeless people), police are
investigating talk on the streets that a pack of young men has been
picking on homeless people for thrills. In the only case so far
with a witness, police said that someone reported several juvenile
male suspects beating a homeless man in a downtown alley.
</P>
<P>
   The perpetrators, said Lt. Judith Will of the Denver Police
Department, ``may get a sort of high or thrill by beating up
people, and homeless are such an easy target.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, instances where homeless people are
murdered simply because they provide convenient targets for a
deranged person. Such was the case in San Francisco last year, when
a man who believed he was a vampire slashed the throats of four
homeless people, one fatally, and then drank their blood.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, as one in San Francisco earlier this year where
a homeless man standing on a corner was killed by a bullet meant
for someone else, the victim is a bystander. And because many
people on the streets are mentally ill or drug addicted or both,
they are easier to victimize and harder to help, police say, since
they are often unable to describe the time and place of their
attacks or their attackers.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, police say that they can find no evidence of
attacks. In Rapid City, S.D., eight homeless men have drowned in a
trout stream in less than two years, including three this year. The
Rapid City Police Department initially considered the cases
accidental drownings because the men all had high blood alcohol
levels. But homeless men have insisted that the victims, six of
whom were Native Americans, had actually been pushed into the
stream by racist white youths while the victims lay passed out from
alcohol. Police Chief Tom Hennies said that the department, with
help from state and federal law-enforcement officials, is now
considering the drownings possible homicides, ``even though we
don't have a shred of physical proof.''
</P>
<P>
   In Anchorage, where three homeless people were murdered this
year, at least a dozen older, homeless men have said they were
attacked by bands of marauding youths. But they were not able to
provide concrete details of the crimes or suspects, the police
said.
</P>
<P>
   The only comprehensive survey done on violence against homeless
people was a study in New York City in 1994, after several attacks
where youths set fire to sleeping homeless people. The survey found
that 80 percent of homeless people had been victims of violent
crime.
</P>
<P>
   While there have been no spectacular incidents of violence
against homeless people in New York since the survey was done, Mary
Ann Brosnahan, director of the New York Coalition for the Homeless,
said the coalition occasionally hears anecdotal reports of
harassment. ``We know that homeless people are far more likely to
be the victims of violent crime,'' she said, ``than the
perpetrators.''

THE TALENTED MS. PALTROW

<P>
   It just doesn't seem like awards season without Gwyneth
Paltrow's name being mentioned everywhere. But after the whirlwind
year that culminated last March when she won the best actress Oscar
for ``Shakespeare in Love,'' the 27-year-old superstar is more than
happy to be out of the spotlight for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, I've only felt sort of the traumatic part of it,''
says the lithe, articulate actress, looking atypically dour with
her trademark golden hair dyed brunet. ``I haven't felt any of the
lightness and joy that everybody expects that I would be feeling,
or felt at some point.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, it's just so nerve-wracking,'' adds Paltrow,
whose weepy acceptance speeches earlier this year sometimes looked
more like a nervous breakdown. ``It goes on for months, and it's so
exhausting and draining. I mean, you think, `Is this some
popularity contest?' You just think about yourself in all these
different ways, what you're wearing ... and everybody is focusing
on you.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason why the focus is less intense this time
around is that although Paltrow's latest movie, ``The Talented Mr.
Ripley,'' is receiving glowing reviews and a good share of
preliminary nominations, her work in it is so subtly expert that,
at least according to her co- star, its brilliance is easily
overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's her best work, actually,'' says longtime pal Matt
Damon, who, like others associated with ``Ripley,'' received a
Golden Globe nomination this week. ``I hope it's noticed. I mean,
`Shakespeare in Love' was an incredible performance, but because
she played so many different characters, it attracted a lot of
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is so subtle, and it's such a wonderfully dark
journey that her character goes on,'' Damon continues. ``She looks
about a thousand years older at the end of the movie than at the
beginning. And all without any `Look at me, look at me'; just very
precise, beautiful work.''
</P>
<P>
   In a role expanded by screenwriter-director Anthony Minghella
(``The English Patient'') from Patricia Highsmith's source novel,
Paltrow plays Marge Sherwood, an aristocratic (of course) young
American trying to become a writer in 1950s Italy. She's happily
living La Dolce Vita with Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law), the
handsome, charming and totally self-absorbed heir to a shipping
fortune. When Dickie's disgusted father sends the slippery Tom
Ripley (Damon) to Europe in hope of retrieving his hedonistic son,
the underprivileged Ripley falls under Dickie's seductive spell,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ripley and Marge become good friends, she grows
suspicious of him after Dickie suddenly ditches both of them. By
the time she's tracked Ripley across the peninsula, she's convinced
of the worst.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Talented Mr. Ripley'' serves up more prestige power
than just about any other film this season (Minghella's ``Patient''
won loads of Oscars, including best picture, and Cate Blanchett,
another of last year's best actress nominees, is also in the cast),
its lying, murdering protagonist and bisexual undercurrents aren't
the usual elements of A-list Hollywood productions. But that's what
intrigued the actress, who made the film last year before the
awards madness hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was so different,'' Paltrow says. ``It had
qualities of a great, beautiful, epic Hollywood movie while being
totally subversive and un-Hollywood at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   The project also boasted the substantial added attraction of a
six- month shoot in Rome, Naples, Palermo, the pristine isle of
Ischia, Venice _ basically, everywhere you'd want to spend a lot of
time in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   But the faraway production was not a happy experience for the
normally travel-happy Paltrow. Her father, TV show producer and
director Bruce Paltrow, was ill during much of the period, and a
beloved grandfather was close to death. Although the cast and crew
did everything in their power to make Paltrow feel better, she
simply couldn't take her mind off of the troubles back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The actual work was cathartic,'' she explains. ``But you
didn't get to do it for very many minutes during the day. There was
a lot of sitting around, and that part was very hard for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all got homesick,'' she quickly adds, trying to avoid
sounding self-pitying. ``Everybody has this image of going to Italy
for six months being so great. But meanwhile, that's a long time to
be away from the people you love. You're mostly in a hotel room,
having room service and going, `This is my life?' It's just not
what people think.''
</P>
<P>
   The two movies Paltrow's made since ``Ripley'' were a little
easier to handle. For one thing, her father recovered substantially
enough to direct one of them, ``Duets,'' a romantic comedy set in a
karaoke bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was just the opposite'' of feeling isolated in Europe,
Paltrow says. ``He spoiled me so much! It was great.''
</P>
<P>
   It also felt good to make the romantic drama ``Bounce'' with
former boyfriend Ben Affleck. ``We had a great time doing it,'' she
says. ``We are still great friends in the real sense of the word.''
</P>
<P>
   But even though it was wonderful to reach out and have others
there after a year of tumultuous highs and lows, Paltrow realized
that what she really needed to do was work on herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, for a long time, `Oh, if I get to this level I'll
be happy' or `If I earn this amount of money I'll be happy' or `If
I could just buy that, I'll be happy,''' she reveals. ``What I've
come to realize is _ and I think that I am successful to have
learned this lesson _ that nothing I can buy, no boy, no painting,
no anything fulfills you. It's all within you, and people are
looking in the wrong direction.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past year, Paltrow has seriously pursued yoga and
meditation, searching for inner peace while trying to detach
herself from worldly concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We forget that we are spirits, not just heads that walk around
on these bodies,'' she observes. ``Once you realize that you're
just humble and little, you feel a lot of power.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Paltrow has basically learned the essence of most
fables, religions and philosophies here. But actually feeling it,
this most accomplished of young actresses acknowledges, is a
different thing from reading or hearing about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely something you have to discover yourself,'' she
says. ``Like with any real lesson in life, nobody can tell you
anything. You've got to experience it, you've got to go through it,
you've got to understand it for yourself. That's how you learn, by
making big mistakes and saying, `I should've listened to my
parents.'''
</P>
<P>
   If she had listened to her parents, Paltrow might be a lawyer
now. Though her dad oversaw such acclaimed shows as ``St.
Elsewhere'' and ``The White Shadow,'' and her mother, Blythe
Danner, has long been a respected stage and screen actress, they
weren't necessarily thrilled with their daughter's decision to
pursue show business.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted me to finish college,'' she recalls. ``But after
Daddy saw a dress rehearsal of a play I was doing, he came
backstage, and he was kind of misty-eyed _ we have a crying problem
in my family _ and he said, `Y'know, I don't think you should go
back to college.'''
</P>
<P>
   How many kids hear those golden words? And Dad was right.
Paltrow made an indelible impression in her first adult film role
as a hard-hearted grifter in ``Flesh and Bone.'' She soon
established herself as an indie film princess (James Ivory's
``Jefferson in Paris,'' Paul Thomas Anderson's ``Hard Eight''), a
deft mimic of British accents (``Emma,'' ``Sliding Doors,''
``Shakespeare in Love'') and a reliable Hollywood star (``Seven,''
``A Perfect Murder'').
</P>
<P>
   In the process, she also became a reluctant celebrity. Her
romance with Brad Pitt was a media circus of major proportions, but
even at its most intrusive, she handled the press with
characteristic poise and humor.
</P>
<P>
   But that, understandably, has gotten more than tiresome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wish that I could find a way to be less out there,''
Paltrow says. ``But it's hard. You do a film, and the studio wants
you to support the movie, do magazine covers and press, and that
just puts you out there more.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I would think, at a certain point, the American public
just can't take any more,'' she adds with a chuckle. ``You would
hope, anyway. You would hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the media tires of Gwyneth-watching or not, perhaps the
most important lesson Paltrow has learned from her year of
astounding highs, shattering lows and quiet contemplation is
something that she really already knew: that she's in the movie
game because she loves it. And that she can only play it on her own
terms, not according to the demands of stardom or commerce _ or
even awards considerations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even think about that,'' she admits. ``I just want to
do what I want to do, and I want to do things that I respond to. If
I let outside influences or pressure in terms of what other
people's expectations are of me affect my choices, then I'm not an
artist anymore. Then I'm a businesswoman, and that's not who I
am.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Even Braves offended by Rocker rant
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ John Rocker went to bed Tuesday night a brash, young
baseball star. He awoke Wednesday morning a pariah.
</P>
<P>
   In a scathing published report that sent shockwaves through
baseball, Rocker lashed out at minorities, questioned the Atlanta
Braves' competitiveness and despaired of riding a New York subway
system sitting ``...next to some queer with AIDS, right next to
some dude who just got of jail for the fourth time. ...''
</P>
<P>
   And he was just warming up. In the new issue of Sports
Illustrated, Rocker went on to disparage women, Asians, Russians
and even Hispanics, a remarkable comment given that both his
catchers with the Braves, Javy Lopez and Eddie Perez, are Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   If Rocker's on-field tirades against New York fans were ever
truly entertaining, they aren't anymore. He faces fines or
suspension from Major League Baseball, though both the
commissioner's office as well as the Braves put off any punitive
response until Rocker has a chance to account for his remarks.
``While John admitted having said these things,'' Braves general
manager John Schuerholz said, ``he told me (Wednesday) that over
the course of a 7 1/2-hour conversation with this writer (SI's Jeff
Pearlman) in the presence of his girlfriend, that these comments
weren't offered _ and again, I'm not offering a defense for John
Rocker; I'm just saying what he said to me _ in the vein or in the
spirit that they appeared in this article.''
</P>
<P>
   Club owner Ted Turner, out of town on a holiday vacation, had no
immediate response, nor did manager Bobby Cox, who has enjoyed
uncommon tranquility during his current 10-year stint in the Braves
dugout. But Rocker, who was able to inflame the passions of New
York fans in both Shea Stadium and Yankee Stadium, this time has
offended a legion of fans, his teammates and the game itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can issue all the apologies you want,'' pitcher Tom
Glavine said, ``but you're still going to have to face some angry
people, particularly the players, the African-American guys, Latin
guys, all the people he offended, and that by no means excludes the
rest of us, either. I could not stand any further from what he
said.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker, who was in Orlando, Fla., participating in a charity
softball game for Nicaragua relief, was not initially available for
comment. But his Texas-based agent, Randal Hendricks, released a
statement in which Rocker explained that what had begun as another
rant against New York grew in focus and rage the longer he went.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone makes mistakes and I hope everyone can put this aside
and begin with a fresh start in the 2000 season,'' Rocker's
statement read. ``I am contrite.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be more difficult than he anticipates. Some of the
strongest response came from within Rocker's team.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I read, there was enough to make anybody angry,
especially your teammates and members of management,'' said right
fielder Brian Jordan, who suggested the Braves trade Rocker.
``That's pretty bad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a society now where people are not afraid of the
ramifications of what they say and what they do,'' Glavine added.
``You can say and do whatever you want and just go ahead and issue
an apology and everything's OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it's not. It's not right. You can read all the apologies
you want but this will carry a whole lot more weight in our
clubhouse than what it will carry anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker, who just completed his first full year in the majors,
emerged from being just another kid with a fastball last season
into one of the game's most wicked closers, reaching speeds of 97
mph while striking out 104 batters in 72 1/3 innings. His 38 saves
were the second most by a reliever in Braves history and his
reputation only grew in the postseason, when he recorded a win and
two saves and allowed just five hits and no earned runs over 13
October innings.
</P>
<P>
   But his tirades against New York fans, punctuated by spitting
and obscene gestures, drew as much attention. The Braves, including
Cox, cautioned Rocker to tone down his act but he declined, and in
this week's article he denied Cox or anyone ever addressed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very disappointing and upsetting,'' said pitching coach
Leo Mazzone. ``Baseball is a very humbling game and the kid's going
to end up being humbled physically and mentally or be out of the
game. And from somebody with only one full season? I mean, look in
the clubhouse and see the class of the Glavines and the Smoltzes
and the Madduxes.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Rocker's harshest targets was the Braves themselves.
Ridiculing the club's quiet, buttoned-down image, he took issue
with the stoicism that Glavine, John Smoltz and Greg Maddux have
perpetuated.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the fiery guys _ we get annoyed at their stoicism,''
Rocker is quoted as saying. ``There needs to be more atmosphere in
our clubhouse. I don't mean loud music and hooting and hollering.
But I don't think having the atmosphere of a doctor's office
helps.''

ALLEGED NEGLIGENCE RESULTS IN DOCTOR'S SUSPENSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Massachusetts officials have summarily suspended a
doctor's license to practice because of repeated instances of
alleged negligent care _ the first time in years that the state has
cited medical malpractice in taking such an emergency action.
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Registration in Medicine has charged 61-year-old
Dr. Joseph P. Whalen of Concord with missing obvious heart attacks
in two patients and misdiagnosing prostate and colon cancer in two
others. One of the four patients, a 43-year-old man, died.
</P>
<P>
   Whalen, a 1965 Boston University Medical School graduate, is a
former Harvard Community Health Plan staff member now employed as a
prison doctor at Nashua Street Jail and other state and county
correctional facilities. Neither he nor his attorney could be
reached.
</P>
<P>
   The medical board has previously used its summary suspension
powers against physicians accused of sexually abusing patients or
selling drugs, or those who are clearly impaired by alcohol or drug
abuse, said Nancy Achin Sullivan, the board's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is significant,'' Sullivan said of the action against
Whalen. To suspend a license, the seven-member board must find that
the public safety, health, or welfare would be endangered by
allowing the doctor to practice pending sometimes-lengthy
disciplinary proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to ``a pattern of substandard practice between 1990
and 1996,'' the board charged Whalen with lying on his 1997 license
renewal application when he answered ``no'' to a question on
whether he had been subject to disciplinary actions in the previous
two years.
</P>
<P>
   The board said that in one case involving a 75-year-old diabetic
man, Whalen allegedly failed to diagnose a heart attack over a
12-day period, despite repeated abnormal electrocardiograms that
documented the ailment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, even to a layman, this patient was in the midst of an
acute cardiac event,'' the board's expert consultant on the case,
Dr. Henry Maltz, a Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates doctor from
Wellesley, wrote in a letter to the licensure panel.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, a 43-year-old male patient at a Harvard
Community Health Plan in Chelmsford died from widely spread colon
cancer after Whalen allegedly failed to diagnose the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The colon cancer patient had been seeing Whalen for more than a
year, complaining of rectal bleeding, before the malignancy was
finally diagnosed in June, 1991. Whalen never ordered appropriate
tests for colon cancer and assured the patient ``that he had
nothing wrong with him aside from hemorrhoids,'' according to
medical board documents.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, Whalen's alleged error was compounded by another
physician, who thought the patient's fatigue was caused by anemia
and prescribed iron supplements rather than investigate the cause
of the bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   The second physician was not named in documents on Whalen's
case, and board officials could not say whether that doctor also
worked at Harvard Community Health Plan. By law the board may not
comment on complaints or investigations that are pending.
</P>
<P>
   After that episode, Whalen continued to work at the Harvard
Plan's Chelmsford center until the spring of 1997, when the health
plan suspended his clinical privileges following his alleged
misdiagnosis of the diabetic patient's heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the board in May, 1997, Whalen admitted fault in
failing to take adequate steps to evaluate the patient's abnormal
electrocardiogram and said he resigned ``because of my chagrin and
dismay over my handling of this case.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he told the board that the heart attack case was ``an
isolated incident'' and said he had worked at the Harvard Plan
since 1989 ``without incident,'' failing to mention the 1990 colon
cancer misdiagnosis or another 1994 misdiagnosis of a severe heart
problem.
</P>
<P>
   The board also listed 15 other complaints against Whalen by
Harvard Plan patients, including another alleging cancer
misdiagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   The 1994 case involved a 63-year-old woman who came to the
Harvard Plan's Peabody center, moaning and complaining of back
pain. A nurse noted her skin had ``a grayish pallor'' and asked
Whalen to look at the woman's electrocardiogram results, according
to board documents.
</P>
<P>
   Maltz, the expert consultant, told the board earlier this month
that the woman's EKG showed she was having a heart attack. ``This
is NOT a subtle finding,'' Maltz wrote. ``I believe that an average
third-year medical student could have properly interpreted this
EKG.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Whalen diagnosed a chronic kidney problem and sent her
home, according to the investigation. Three days later she was
rushed to Salem Hospital, where doctors diagnosed the heart attack,
heart failure, and an electrical problem called total heart block,
which required emergency surgery for insertion of a pacemaker. She
also suffered a minor stroke. She subsequently filed a malpractice
suit against Whalen.
</P>
<P>
   In a fourth case, a 57-year-old man had an abnormal blood test
possibly signalling prostate cancer, but the board's investigation
found that Whalen attributed the result to nonmalignant prostate
enlargement.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-six months later, a repeat blood test showed an even
higher abnormal result. A urologist then performed a biopsy showing
prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   In a complaint to the state board, the prostate cancer patient
stated ``that he was very, very angry and distraught, and that his
chances for a cure. . . may have been extremely compromised,'' a
board investigator wrote. The patient has filed a malpractice suit.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, Whalen told the board that the abnormal blood test
came back late. ``There is no question that there were problems at
that time with reporting of lab results,'' Whalen told the board.
``I could have kept a log of patients who had pending lab results,
but the volume was too great.''
</P>
<P>
   Whalen is entitled to a hearing on the board's action within
seven days.

<TEXT>
<P>
   RAMALLAH, West Bank _ Despite speculation that the resumption of
Israeli-Syrian talks would derail the Palestinian peace track,
significant progress appeared to have been made early Wednesday
morning in an intimate meeting here overnight between Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time that an Israeli prime minister had
ventured into a Palestinian-controlled city for a peace meeting,
which in itself broke a barrier in the relationship. And the
setting was very casual: Barak and Arafat met in the elegant home
of the Palestinian leader's second-in-command, Mahmoud Abbas,
better known as Abu Mazen, his revolutionary name.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the villa, the two leaders talked for three hours, from
late Tuesday until early Wednesday, gathered with associates around
a banquet of Arabic salads and meat dishes. The security, both
Israeli and Palestinian, was tight, but the meeting and its
location had been kept secret and there were no disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, both sides said that two deadlocked issues
that have bedeviled progress were essentially resolved. An Israeli
transfer of 5 percent of the West Bank, which has been delayed for
five weeks, is now likely to take place within a week, both sides
said. And the Israelis are also expected to release more prisoners
as a gesture for Ramadan, the Islamic holy month, which ends early
next month.
</P>
<P>
   The details were left to negotiators who did not attend the
talks, and Saeb Erekat, a senior Palestinian negotiator, had left
an early evening session in Jerusalem declaring that not a single
issue had been resolved.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether Erekat was sincerely downbeat or adopting
a tough posture. His stance contrasted with the comments from two
senior Palestinians who attended the late-night meeting. Exuding
confidence, one of them, Nabil Abu Rudeineh, a spokesman for
Arafat, said early Wednesday that the Palestinians would ``witness
results in the very near future.''
</P>
<P>
   Another senior Palestinian had suggested that the Palestinians,
who had held up the land transfer because its is largely
unpopulated desert, were persuaded to accept the original offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah, we still have two other redeployments,'' the official
said, referring to land transfers, the first scheduled for January.
The official suggested that the Palestinians had been given
assurances that more populated territory would be included in the
next Israeli withdrawals from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides reported that the atmosphere at the late-night
meeting was good and open, and that they would now accelerate
talks, including more face-to-face sessions between the two
leaders, in preparation for a possible meeting in the United States
in February.
</P>
<P>
   The talks ``renewed the trust and cooperation between the two
sides,'' Foreign Minister David Levy said on Israel radio, adding
that the transfer of land was imminent.

   During the talks, Arafat was accompanied not only by Abu Mazen
but also by Abu Ala, the speaker of the Palestinian Legislative
Council. Abu Ala (also a revolutionary name) was senior negotiator
of the Oslo peace accord, but is technically no longer a
negotiator.
</P>
<P>
   But with his calm, businesslike manner, he, as one Palestinian
analyst said, is ``the man who has the keys in his hands when
things get stuck.''
</P>
<P>
   Abu Ala reportedly met more than a dozen times with former Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

<P>
   Barak was joined by Levy and Danny Yatom, his security adviser,
both of whom accompanied him to Washington last week.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the meeting, Barak gave Arafat a 40-minute
briefing on his meetings in Washington with the Syrian foreign
minister, Farouk al-Sharaa.
</P>
<P>
   While the Israelis and Syrians were meeting in Washington, the
Palestinians publicly expressed support for the idea that another
peace front had been re-opened. But they privately voiced concern
that their negotiations would suffer, especially because the
Palestinians and Syrians, with bad blood between them, are unlikely
to work as allies against Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians said they feared Barak would adopt a firmer
line on territorial concessions in the West Bank because he is
considered likely to return the Golan Heights to Syria; the Israeli
public, it was predicted, could not swallow too much at once. The
Israelis also worried that Barak would not have time to conduct two
full-scale rounds at once.
</P>
<P>
   But Barak pledged to the Palestinians that he would strive to
prove their fears unjustified.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told Arafat that he told al-Sharaa that we have a
commitment toward Palestinians, and that everything should be
honest and decent,'' a senior Israeli official said. ``He told him
that he told al-Sharaa that we are not going to play or use one
track against the other because we will lose. We will continue
simultaneously. And he said that al-Sharaa responded positively and
said he appreciated, understood and respected all that.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli prime ministers have stepped onto Palestinian soil,
crossing a few yards over the border at the Erez checkpoint in
Gaza. But this represented the first genuine foray into the heart
of the Palestinian Authority's territory, and a kind of submission
to their turf. The Palestinians were decidedly the hosts at the
white stone and red brick villa in a quiet neighborhood. And they
sounded very upbeat afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will witness starting from next week progress in all
respects,'' a senior Palestinian official said. ``Barak promised to
honor all his commitments in the interim agreements. We told him
that this will create a positive atmosphere. Barak also spoke a lot
of settlement activity, and he gave positive promises. But on that
front, it's premature. We have to wait and witness that he does
what he says.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak, whose government has angered Palestinians by authorizing
new construction at Jewish settlements in the West Bank, has
promised to freeze the expansion. He has acknowledged that it was
counter-productive in his pursuit of a final status framework
agreement by mid-February.
</P>
<P>
   But the Palestinians are wary. Formal final status negotiations
have stalled because of their concern, though quiet talks have
continued. One Palestinian participant in talks on land and borders
says even Jerusalem, a subject Israel says is nonnegotiable, has
been broached.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Israelis keep talking about the Al-Aksa mosque and the
Mount of Olives,'' he said, ``which means they are talking about
the fate of Jerusalem.''

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT TO APPOINT MONITOR TO OVERSEE NEW JERSEY STATE
POLICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Citing extensive evidence that New Jersey State
Police officers have discriminated against minority motorists, the
Justice Department announced on Wednesday that it will appoint an
outside monitor to oversee the police agency and to ensure that it
enacts reforms.
</P>
<P>
   The monitor, who will be chosen by the U.S. attorney in New
Jersey and report directly to a federal judge, will have broad
powers to inspect virtually any function of officers and their
supervisors, but will specifically order them to keep records of
arrests and traffic stops by race to make sure that minorities are
not being singled out.
</P>
<P>
   The monitor will also be charged with following through on the
Justice Department's recommendations that New Jersey overhaul the
Police Department's secretive internal affairs system, which many
civil rights advocates and former troopers said was used to protect
abusive and bigoted officers.
</P>
<P>
   The state would face contempt of court charges if it failed to
comply.
</P>
<P>
   The outside oversight, which was announced as part of a legal
agreement between the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division
and the state, is the first time federal officials have installed a
monitor to supervise a police agency specifically because of
evidence that officers were focusing on members of minorities
during traffic stops.
</P>
<P>
   Two other law enforcement agencies, the Police Departments in
Pittsburgh and in Steubenville, Ohio, have also reached settlements
with the Justice Department to resolve accusations that their
officers engaged in misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of a monitor was also a political rebuke to Gov.
Christie Whitman, who denied that there was any pattern of
discrimination by troopers until April, nearly three years after a
state judge in Gloucester County ruled that there was compelling
evidence of widespread use of the practice, known as racial
profiling.
</P>
<P>
   The governor did not attend the joint news conference with
Justice Department officials, and in a written statement she said
she was gratified that the federal government had endorsed many of
the same reforms the state attorney general proposed earlier this
year. But Justice Department investigators, who spoke only on the
condition of anonymity, said that they found the discrimination to
be more serious and widely accepted by officers and supervisors
than the state attorney general's office had acknowledged in its
report.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Lann Lee, acting assistant attorney general for civil
rights, would not characterize the specific findings of the Justice
Department's three-year investigation. Lee said, however, that the
agreement with the state and the appointment of the outside monitor
would end the inattentive supervision, training and disciplinary
practices that the Justice Department said allowed some officers to
single out black and Hispanic motorists with impunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This agreement will establish real safeguards against racially
discriminatory stops and searches for motorists who drive on New
Jersey highways,'' Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   By entering the agreement, called a consent decree, with New
Jersey officials, the Justice Department will drop its threat to
file a civil lawsuit against the state for failing to protect the
rights of minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement signed on Wednesday, troopers are forbidden
to use race as a factor in traffic stops or in decisions to conduct
a search except when they are pursuing a specific criminal suspect
and have a detailed description.
</P>
<P>
   Troopers will also be required to document the race, gender and
ethnicity of all drivers who are stopped, and state police
supervisors and the federal monitor will review officers'
activities on a computer database.
</P>
<P>
   The state police, an agency so independent that it has often
refused to provide information to lawmakers and other state
officials, has also agreed to issue public reports twice a year and
to provide a breakdown of arrests and traffic stops by race.
</P>
<P>
   Carson Dunbar Jr., who was appointed superintendent of the
2,700-member police force after his predecessor, Col. Carl A.
Williams, was dismissed for making racially insensitive comments,
said that the new policies would provide a road map for supervisors
trying to improve the force.
</P>
<P>
   The state attorney general, John J. Farmer Jr., said that the
intense scrutiny from both state officials and the federal monitor
would provide a strong deterrent to any officer inclined to
discriminate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is simple,'' Farmer said. ``If discriminatory
treatment is made difficult to conceal, it will be unlikely to
occur.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department began to examine the department in 1996,
when a judge in Gloucester County found evidence of discrimination
by state troopers after hearing that black drivers on the New
Jersey Turnpike were five times more likely than whites to be
stopped.
</P>
<P>
   The federal inquiry intensified in April 1998, when officers
shot three unarmed minority men during a traffic stop on the
turnpike, and racial profiling instantly became a dominant
political issue in New Jersey and the most troubling crisis of
Whitman's tenure as governor.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Steven H. Rosenbaum, who led the Justice Department
investigation, said that federal authorities found ``extensive
problems'' in the tactics used by some officers and their
supervisors' failure to address discrimination complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The monitor will oversee sweeping changes in the state police's
internal affairs office, which has long been accused of cronyism
and cover-up. Rosenbaum said that in other police departments under
federal supervision, the monitors review internal affairs cases and
can demand a reinvestigation if the findings or investigative
techniques appear dubious.
</P>
<P>
   If the state police balk at any of the monitor's requests,
Justice Department officials can ask a federal judge to find the
department in contempt of court for violating the decree. But Lee
said that the Whitman administration had cooperated throughout the
investigation and that he hoped to use the proposed reforms as a
model for other law enforcement agencies accused of selective
enforcement and racial discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights leaders in New Jersey were relieved that the
Justice Department insisted on outside oversight. Although Whitman
dismissed the former police superintendent in February and has
since installed several layers of supervision within the attorney
general's office, many black and Hispanic leaders feared that the
state might not follow through on its plans to revamp the force.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the consent decree is tough and can ensure that the
state helps to end racial profiling and discrimination,'' said the
Rev. Reginald T. Jackson, director of the Black Ministers Council
of New Jersey. ``The facts speak for themselves. You have a new
superintendent, a new attorney general and a new assistant attorney
general. But the Justice Department recognizes that we need someone
else to watch them because they were so slow to respond in the
first place.''

U.N. PANEL AGREES ON TWO-YEAR BUDGET 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ A General Assembly committee reached agreement
Wednesday on a two-year budget for the organization that U.S.
diplomats hope will fall within the ``nominal no-growth'' spending
demanded by the U.S. Congress in return for releasing money to pay
overdue U.S. debts.
</P>
<P>
   The budget is expected to be approved by the full General
Assembly on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The two-year budget for the headquarters _ not including money
to be spent on agencies like UNICEF or the World Heath
Organization, which raise their own funds _ has been held to $2.535
billion, $2 million more than the previous budget, diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   The American demand for a no-growth budget, which some U.N.
officials see as hamstringing the organization for domestic
political reasons in Washington, was one of many conditions that
Congress attached to payments to the United Nations. The United
States is now more than $1 billion in debt, a sum close to the U.N.
operating expenses for one year.
</P>
<P>
   The most difficult congressional condition remains to be
settled, a demand to lower U.S. payments to the organization. The
payments are linked to the proportion of the world economy in the
hands of the United States. That issue will be taken up in the new
year.

   Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott discussed arms control
and other issues with Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, but the two
appeared to make little headway. The Defense Ministry again
ridiculed United States proposals to alter the 1972 antiballistic

ALTON A. LINDSEY, 92, DIES; ECOLOGIST LEFT GLOBAL IMPRINT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Okla.)  (js) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alton A. Lindsey, a pioneer ecologist who was believed to be the
last living scientist from the Antarctica expeditions of Adm.
Richard E. Byrd, died on Sunday at his home in Tulsa, Okla. He was
92.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey lived his life at the environmental ramparts. He studied
penguins and seals in the Antarctic, permafrost in the Arctic and
an enormous lava bed in New Mexico that became the 114,000-acre El
Malpais National Monument. He studied starlings, volcanic
vegetation, ducks and the sand dunes on the Indiana shore of Lake
Michigan, which became the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore partly
as a result of his labors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Few investigators, past or present, have achieved excellence
in such varied aspects of ecology,'' the Ecological Society of
America said in naming him ``eminent ecologist for 1976.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey's influence is suggested by the many things named after
him. At Byrd's suggestion, 12 islands on the coast of Antarctica
are called the Lindsey Islands. A new genus and species of bug was
named after him, the Lindseyus coastus. The University of Arizona
named the oldest dated wood in the American Southwest the Lindsey
Ancient Tree Site. The wood, in El Malpais National Monument, was
traced to 190 B.C. through radiocarbon dating.
</P>
<P>
   Fellowships at Purdue University and Goshen College in Indiana
were named for him. In 1988, the National Park Service presented
the first Alton A. Lindsey Award in Science and Research
Stewardship. Two months ago, Purdue University dedicated the Alton
Lindsey Field Laboratory at its Ross Biological Reserve, which
Lindsey founded 50 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But Lindsey's warm, soft-spoken touch, not to mention his bad
puns, were at the core of people's memories. He recalled with awe
the first time he witnessed the Aurora Australis, the southern
lights. He laughed about the time Byrd fell off a dogsled he was
steering. He penned a volume of ecological limericks under the pen
name ``Windan Waters.''
</P>
<P>
   Alton A. Lindsey, the son of a Methodist minister in the
Pittsburgh area, was born on May 7, 1907. He loved the outdoors and
became an Eagle Scout. He studied wildlife, sometimes capturing
live birds to examine. When a family cat ate one, the cat
disappeared, though the nephew who tells the family story, Ralph
Levering, a historian, does not remember being told exactly how.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey graduated from Allegheny College and went on to Cornell
University to study for his doctorate in biology. He interrupted
his studies to serve as the vertebrate biologist from 1933 to 1935
on Byrd's second trip to the Antarctic. While Byrd and others
traveled into the interior toward the South Pole, he stayed on the
coast to study penguins, seals and other animals.
</P>
<P>
   On graduation from Cornell, he took a teaching job at American
University in Washington, where he spotted a coed named Elizabeth
Smith. A few days later, he offered to carry her books home. Byrd
attended their wedding reception.
</P>
<P>
   After his wife graduated from American, they spent their first
summer together working at Glacier National Park as rangers, and
their second summer at Mount Rainier, where Lindsey developed his
interest in the patterns and complexities of vegetation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1940, the Lindseys moved to the University of the Redlands in
California, and then to the University of New Mexico. In 1947, he
accepted an appointment as professor of forest ecology at Purdue
University, where he stayed until his retirement in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   In 1951, he served as ecologist on an Arctic expedition to study
permafrost, sponsored by the U.S. and Canadian governments.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1940s, he became an early and strong proponent of
the natural areas preservation movement. He was a charter member of
the Nature Conservancy and its Indiana chapter. He is credited with
establishing the Pine Hills Nature Preserve and the Big Walnut
Natural Area in Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey wrote 10 books, 15 magazine articles and 70 technical
papers, as well as serving as the editor of numerous magazines and
journals. More playful were his limericks, many of which linked
social and scientific concerns. One concerned the habits of African
hornbills:
</P>
<P>
   ``In a tree hole the female must stay.
</P>
<P>
   Fed by the male through a hole in the clay.
</P>
<P>
   She's beginning to hate
</P>
<P>
   Being jailed by her mate.
</P>
<P>
   So the wife now supports ERA.''
</P>
<P>
   After retirement, he remained active in conservation causes, his
family said. On occasion, he would wear immense fake whiskers and
carry a long walking stick to impersonate the naturalist author
John Burroughs and recite from Burroughs' books about natural
phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   He also remained a steadfast exponent of scientific rigor. As
the debate over creationism versus Darwinism heated up in Oklahoma,
he remained convinced that the overwhelming weight of evidence
favored evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey is survived by his wife; a son, David Earl Lindsey of
Alexandria, Va.; and a daughter, Louise W. Lindsey of Tulsa.
</P>
<P>
   In a conversation with his minister five days before his death,
Lindsey said: ``I've spent my life marveling at the beauty of what
God created through evolution. And so many people these days miss
seeing God's hand.''
</P>
<P>
   In his final days, when he could neither read nor talk, Lindsey
listened to tapes of the songs of birds.

WALDON MAY BE THIS YEAR'S SURPRISE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
 &HT;     By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KAIE, Hawaii _ This time last year, Wally Szczerbiak was best
known as the guy with the spelling-bee name. By March, the
Miami-Ohio forward was a consensus All-American. By June, he was a
lottery pick.
</P>
<P>
   Who's the next Szczerbiak _ the next great player to emerge from
a mid-level school, dominate March Madness and attract hoards of
NBA scouts?
</P>
<P>
   The Pearl Harbor Classic seems a good place to start, since the
best player in the eight-team event is not a McDonald's
All-American from UCLA but B.B. Waldon, South Florida's unknown
sophomore forward.
</P>
<P>
   Waldon, from Lakeland, Fla., was a teammate of UCLA receiver
Freddie Mitchell at Kathleen High. He did not attend summer camps
following his freshman and sophomore seasons, so he existed outside
national recruiting radar.
</P>
<P>
   Miami, Florida and West Virginia showed some interest, but
Waldon, whose given name is Benitez Bernard, chose South Florida,
in Tampa, 25 minutes from Lakeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Waldon) bought into the vision we sold him on, which was that
we'd build around him,'' said Bulls coach Seth Greenberg, the
former Long Beach State boss. ``Out of high school, he wasn't a
great student. He was a good student, and I think that scared some
people off. But mostly, he's a hometown kid. He's homesick right
now (in Hawaii). He's very much a homeboy. His parents attend every
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Waldon, a skinny 6-8 forward, averaged 16.3 points and seven
rebounds last year. Tuesday night, in a victory over The Citadel,
he made 12 of 15 shots and scored a career-high 31. He is quick, he
has a soft touch, he rebounds, and he's a dedicated passer. He can
score from the low post or the 3-point line. Give him two years to
add strength and refine his perimeter game, and he's a first-round
draft pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I followed Szczerbiak last year, but not real closely,''
Waldon said. ``He's a great player. I'm hoping that one of these
days, people will find out there's a guy at South Florida they
should watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Impressive company:!off! Waldon isn't the only player with a
small reputation and a big game. Here's five names to watch in
March and beyond:
</P>
<P>
   _Bradley wing guard Rob Dye. A converted point guard, Dye is the
best player in the Missouri Valley Conference, and Bradley's the
best team. A 6-1 senior, Dye's averaging 17.6 points and played his
best game against Illinois: 19 points, seven rebounds and four
steals.
</P>
<P>
   _Oakland (Mich.) forward Dan Champagne. A 6-6 junior, Champagne
is out several weeks with dislocated bones in his hand. He played
in six games before the injury, averaged 18 points and 6.3 rebounds
and shot 56.3 percent from the field. He scored 26 against
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   _Siena shooting guard Marcus Faison. The much-traveled son of a
military man, Faison was prepared to sign with New Mexico out of
high school. When the Lobos landed Lamont Long, Faison switched to
Siena. A 6-5 senior, he averages 18.6 points and seven rebounds.
He's also shooting 50 percent from 3-point range. Count Siena as a
team to avoid in March.
</P>
<P>
   _Texas Christian's Marquise Gainous. A nagging ankle injury has
limited Gainous' production this season, but when he gets healthy,
watch out. A 6-9 senior, Gainous scored 40 points twice last season
and will have several NBA scouts watching when the Horned Frogs
play Louisiana Tech tonight.
</P>
<P>
   _Austin Peay wing man Trenton Hassell. The best player in the
Ohio Valley Conference, Hassell is a superb rebounder for his 6-5
frame (8.5 per game). He's also averaging 19 points and 5.3 assists
and shooting 58.5 percent from the field. If Austin Peay can squirm
its way into the NCAA Tournament _ Murray State is the league
favorite _ Hassell will have a national audience for the first time
in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Season to forget? After losing to Wofford, Wisconsin-Green Bay
and Oregon State (by 18 points), Clemson is being compared to the
worst teams in ACC history.
</P>
<P>
   That short, ignominious list includes 1955 Clemson (2-21), 1986
Wake Forest (8-21) and 1989 Maryland (9-20). The Tigers were 5-5
entering Wednesday night's game against George Washington, and they
don't figure to win many in conference play.
</P>
<P>
   The showdown: Barring an upset, Stanford will be undefeated and
ranked No. 1 when the Cardinal hosts Arizona on Jan. 8.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, coach Mike Montgomery downplayed Stanford's ascention
to the top spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's other stuff,'' he said. ``We've just got to be good
enough to compete in our conference.''
</P>
<P>
   That shouldn't be a problem. Stanford and Arizona are the
early-season favorites, while UCLA must prove itself: The Bruins
have lost three of their last four to Arizona and six of their last
seven to Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   Around the Pac-10: The fire alarm at Cal's new Haas Pavilion
went off six minutes before tipoff last weekend against UC Irvine,
forcing evacuation. It was the second consecutive game the alarm
has sounded.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon State coach Eddie Payne is worried the Beavers have lost
their defensive passion. After an offseason of compliments and
lofty (for them) preseason predictions, perhaps expectations have
softened the Beavs.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Consistent: Arizona State guard Eddie House was 0 of 16 from
the field against Brigham Young. In his next game, 11 days later,
House scored 46 points, on 18-of-29 shooting, against San Diego
State.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's reserve center Robertas Javtokas is disgruntled about
playing time and didn't show for the Nebraska game last week. He'd
be the third player to leave Arizona this season, following Ruben
Douglas and Luke Recker. Yes, depth is a concern in Tucson. &QL;

MICROSOFT'S CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER TO BECOME CEO OF WORLDWIDE
FIBER 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: This replaces MICROSOFT-ANTITRUST)  
(lh) 
 By STEVE LOHR and JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft's chief financial officer, Gregory Maffei, resigned
Wednesday to join a Canadian builder of high-speed
telecommunications networks, becoming the latest Microsoft
executive to depart for entrepreneurial opportunities elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Maffei, 39, will become the chief executive of Worldwide Fiber
of Vancouver, British Columbia, a private company that is
aggressively building a fiber-optic network in North America and
across the Atlantic Ocean. Such high-speed networks are seen as
increasingly valuable assets as Internet traffic and data
communications surge.
</P>
<P>
   Maffei's departure, according to industry analysts, should have
little impact on Microsoft Corp. His resignation was announced
after the close of trading Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Maffei had displayed some restlessness at
Microsoft, showing an interest in finding the top job at another
company. Earlier this year, Bill Gates, the Microsoft chairman,
vetoed an effort to recruit Maffei to Roadrunner, a high-speed
Internet service in which Microsoft had a 10-percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, it was Maffei who had negotiated that veto power
for Gates, as Microsoft's lead negotiator in the flurry of
investment deals the company has made with cable television and
telecommunications companies in the last couple of years. When
Gates used that veto to prevent Maffei from leaving, analysts say,
it was probably only a matter of time before his top financial
strategist left.
</P>
<P>
   ``That had to put a strain in the relationship,'' said Richard
Sherlund, an analyst for Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. ``Besides, if you want
to be a chief executive officer, the opportunities are pretty
limited at Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Gates and Mics president, Steven Ballmer, are young
and show no signs of wanting to leave.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone call from Jamaica, where he was vacationing,
Maffei said he had no animosity whatsoever toward the Microsoft
leadership. ``Microsoft has been a tremendous place to be for my
seven years,'' he said. ``But I was interested in running my own
company, and this is a great opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   To build its fiber-optic networks, Worldwide Fiber has tapped
the private capital markets and developed close relations with Wall
Street investment bankers. It was one of those investment bankers,
Jill Greenthal of DLJ, that first approached Maffei with the idea
of heading up the Canadian company, Maffei said.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two months, Maffei sold Microsoft shares worth about
$35 million, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. The filings stated he held options on another 1.71
million shares, and 1.14 million of those options could be
exercised. The rest he will leave on the table when he departs in
January.
</P>
<P>
   Maffei is expected to receive some compensation for Worldwide
Fiber for those unexercisable options. Besides, the Canadian
company plans to sell shares to the public sometime during the
first half of 2000. The initial public offering, if successful,
could prove a handsome payoff for the new chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At Microsoft, Maffei will be succeeded by John Connors, 40, an
11-year veteran at Microsoft, who has served as controller, chief
information officer and, most recentd of the enterprise
sales group. Connors said he expected a ``seamless transition'' to
his new job, noting he had either hired or worked with many of the
800 people in finance and administration who he will now be
overseeing.
</P>
<P>
   Among the possible financial challenges that lie ahead is the
company's potential exposure in a series of civil class actions.
Fortified by the judge's partial verdict last month in the
government's antitrust case against the software giant, lawyers
nationwide have filed about 70 private suits against Microsoft in
the last month.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, at least 45 lawyers attended a meeting at a
Washington law firm or joined by conference call in an effort to
coordinate their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``A large majority of the people who have filed state or federal
actions participated,'' said Michael Hausfeld, a lawyer in the
Washington firm Cohen, Milstein, Hausfeld &AMP; Toll, where the
two-hour conference was held. ``There are a lot of different
issues, divergent views, and we are attempting as best we can to
coordinate. It was a very interactive process.''
</P>
<P>
   The suits vary. Many accuse Microsoft of overcharging buyers for
the Windows operating system and seek triple damages. That charge
is based on Microsoft's admission, in documents, that it charged
$89 for Windows 98, the highest reasonable profit-maximizing price
_ an admission that the judge cited to support his finding that
Microsoft holds monopoly power.
</P>
<P>
   But even the suits raising that charge differ in the length of
time they claim Microsoft is guilty of overcharging. And other
suits raise entirely different issues, leading the lawyers to admit
that it would be no easy task consolidating them. Still, they
described consolidation as essential.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of case needs to be organized,'' said Stanley
Chesley, a Cincinnati lawyer. ``Microsoft is very well organized.''

AMERICAN HOME PRODUCTS AGREES TO SETTLEMENT OF MISSISSIPPI FEN-PHEN
CASES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miss., Mass.)  (rk) 
 By DAVID J. MORROW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   American Home Products Corp. agreed late Tuesday to pay $350
million to settle 1,400 injury cases brought in Mississippi over
its diet drug combination fen-phen, a liability that could endanger
the company's proposed $70 billion merger with Warner-Lambert.
</P>
<P>
   American Home Products moved to settle the cases after a
Mississippi jury had awarded $150 million in compensatory damages
to five plaintiffs, four of whom said the drugs had caused them to
develop primary pulmonary hypertension, an often fatal lung
illness.
</P>
<P>
   The Mississippi settlement touched off debate among analysts
Wednesday as to whether American Home Products' merger with
Warner-Lambert would be completed. Pfizer has made an $82.4 hostile
bid for Warner-Lambert and has shown little mercy in pointing out
American Home Products' weaknesses, including the company's
lingering liabilities involving fen-phen.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Wednesday's closing stock price, Pfizer's offer for
Warner-Lambert was valued at $72.4 billion, while American Home
Products' bid was $51.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Warner-Lambert said in a statement late Wednesday that it
remained committed to its merger with American Home Products. But
Pfizer wasted little time in questioning the wisdom of such a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have offered a 41 percent premium over the American Home
Products' offer,'' said Lou Clemente, executive vice president for
corporate affairs at Pfizer. ``That's a $21 billion difference.
That tells us something anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors did not react so negatively to American Home Products'
latest woes. The company's shares fell 56.25 cents, or 1.4 percent,
to $40. Warner-Lambert increased $1.125, or 1.4 percent, to
$82.9375. Pfizer's shares rose $1.125, or 4.9 percent, to $33.75.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I don't think the merger between American Home
Products and Warner-Lambert will go through, but not because of the
Mississippi settlement,'' said Sergio Traversa, a pharmaceutical
analyst with Mehta Partners. ``But it doesn't help. It's just one
more reason Warner-Lambert should not merge with American Home.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have expressed concern that American Home Products has
yet to put its fen-phen liabilities behind it. Since Pondimin,
American Home Products' brand name for fenfluramine _ the ``fen''
in fen-phen _ and Redux, a similar drug, were removed from the
market in September 1997, 6,500 lawsuits covering 11,000 people
have been filed.
</P>
<P>
   American Home Products agreed in October to pay $3.75 billion to
settle claims that the diet drugs had been harmful. Many analysts
applauded the national agreement, but others thought that it did
not do enough to limit the company's liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, which has yet to receive final approval from a
federal judge, did not include primary pulmonary hypertension cases
and does not prevent fen-phen users from taking their cases to
court. Some plaintiffs' lawyers said Wednesday that after the
Mississippi jury verdict, many fen-phen sufferers would choose to
pursue their claims in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my view, American Home Products' global settlement is now
dead,'' said Ed Blizzard, a plaintiffs' lawyer in Houston who is
involved in many fen-phen cases. ``A lot of people won't go into
the national settlement. If you look at that $150 million award, it
just shows you how angry ordinary citizens get when they hear about
these charges.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though American Home Products moved quickly to settle the
claims, the company told analysts Wednesday that the legal
environment in Mississippi was anything but ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   American Home Products noted in a release Wednesday that even
though Jefferson County, the site of the fen-phen case, had only
8,500 residents, the Circuit Court there had liability claims
pending from more than 10,000 plaintiffs. About 500 of the fen-phen
cases filed in Mississippi were from plaintiffs who lived
elsewhere, including places as far away as Maine and Hawaii,
American Home Products said.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Hoynes, American Home Products' general counsel, also told
analysts that the settlement amount, which was confidential, was
substantially less than $500 million, which had been cited in
earlier news reports. Analysts said Wednesday that the total payout
for the Mississippi cases was estimated at $350 million.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear, though, just how many of the fen-phen plaintiffs
would pursue their own cases or join the national settlement. After
the national agreement had been signed, many lawyers had said that
it would allow many sufferers to receive a monetary award faster
than if they were to go to court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with the Mississippi settlement, the national agreement
will still go forward,'' said Stanley Chesley, a partner with
Waite, Schneider, Bayless &AMP; Chesley in Cincinnati, one of the chief
negotiators of the national agreement. ``It is not meant to include
every case in every state.''
</P>
<P>
   The settlement in Mississippi won't be American Home Products'
last day in court. The company said that it faces a similar case
next month in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the series of lawsuits filed between Pfizer and
Warner-Lambert regarding Pfizer's hostile takeover bid will begin
Jan. 10 in Delaware Chancery Court.  &QL;

SUSPECT'S POSSIBLE CONNECTION TO ARMED ISLAMIC GROUP PROBED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT SUNDE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even in the world of terrorism, where car bombings, political
assassinations and hijackings are the norm, the Armed Islamic Group
is extreme.
</P>
<P>
   The terrorist organization has made women who don't wear veils
in its native Algeria military targets, called massacres of
villagers ``an offering to God'' and loaded a hijacked Air France
jetliner with dynamite to spread flaming wreckage on Paris.
</P>
<P>
   It is the group mentioned by law enforcement officials as having
possible connections with Ahmed Ressam, who sits in a federal
detention center in Seattle and is charged with bringing
nitroglycerin into the United States from Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Customs Service inspectors also found urea _ a component for
fertilizer and powerful explosives _ and four timing devices in his
rental car last week when he arrived in Port Angeles by ferry from
Victoria.
</P>
<P>
   French authorities still want to question a former roommate of
Ressam's and an Alergian national about a Paris subway bombing
blamed on the Armed Islamic Group, Canadian authorities say. News
reports suggest Ressam may also have ties to a second Algerian who
is a veteran of the war in Afghanistan and may be responsible for
bombings in northern France three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the Armed Islamic Group may also have ties to
Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born terrorist blamed for bombing two
American embassies in Africa last year.
</P>
<P>
   The link is Afghanistan, whose war to drive the Soviet Union
from its borders drew volunteer fighters from throughout the
Islamic world. Ressam may have been one of them, according to
unconfirmed intelligence reports cited by The New York Times. That
would make him an ``Afghan,'' something of a term of awe in the
Islamic world for the men who fought in that war.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators are continuing to piece together Ressam's
connections, if any, to terrorist organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam, a would-be grocer and accused thief in his adopted city
of Montreal, has been accused of terrorist connections before.
Immigration documents released this week in Canadian courts show
Ressam was accused of arms dealing and belonging to a terrorist
group in Algeria. He denied both allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ``To them, I was simply an Islamic terrorist, even though I had
never been associated with Islamic movements,'' he states in the
documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent a few hellish days in a jail cell. I was tortured with
a rag doused with soap and bleach ...
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result of this suffering and injustice to an innocent
man, I fear that the legal system is working against me. For that
reason, I have decided to seek exile.''
</P>
<P>
   Ressam, who arrived in Montreal in 1994 with a fake French
passport, was considered to have given up his request for refugee
status in Canada. Officials later issued a warrant for his arrest
when he failed to show up for a hearing that could have prompted
his removal from Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The facts of the most recent criminal case he faces in the
United States trouble experts on terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   It may mean that the Armed Islamic Group, which so far has
confined its activities to Algeria and France, is expanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are anti-Western and anti-foreigner,'' said Martha
Crenshaw, an expert on terrorism and government professor at
Connecticut's Wesleyan University. ``As far as I know, they have
never acted outside the context of France and Algeria.''
</P>
<P>
   David Harris, a former Canadian intelligence official, said
Ressam's actions may say something about the organization behind
him.
</P>
<P>
   The results of surveillance may be the reason that Ressam tried
to cross into the United States at out-of-the-way Port Angeles,
said Harris, former chief of strategic planning of the Canadian
Security Intelligence Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could argue that the slow-boat-to-China approach is in a
way a little pedestrian. But maybe it was regarded as the least
suspicious. There may have been a reconnaissance cell that decided
security was not as tight there.''
</P>
<P>
   There also has been speculation that Ressam may have been only a
courier. He had reservations for one night in Seattle and plane
tickets for London the next day.
</P>
<P>
   That would mean a larger organization _ one that had taken some
care in planning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it may have been that he was just a courier,'' Harris
said. ``But that division of labor is itself ominous.''
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw doubts that the Armed Islamic Group has designs on the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam may be ``a kind of freelancer, not representing the
Algerian group,'' said Crenshaw, whose first book was about
terrorism in Algeria.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's the plausible motive? It's more likely the bin Laden
group and not the Armed Islamic Group,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She and Harris said there are likely connections between
Algerian terrorist groups and bin Laden. Some members of the Armed
Islamic Group fought with other Islamic rebels in Afghanistan and
are called ``Afghans.''
</P>
<P>
   To many inside the group, the ``Afghans'' were regarded as
especially tough, veteran fighters, Crenshaw said.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden has training camps in Afghanistan and has reportedly
trained Algerians there.
</P>
<P>
   The Armed Islamic Group, as well as the ongoing blood-letting in
Algeria, has its roots in the early 1990s. Islamic fundamentalists
won a majority of seats in the Algerian National Assembly in
elections in December 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The government canceled a second round of elections set for
January 1992, throwing the country into civil war. One terrorist
group, the Islamic Salvation Front, began violently resisting the
government. A few years ago, however, it called a truce.
</P>
<P>
   The Armed Islamic Group has no interest in truces, negotiations
or compromises. It is known by the acronym GIA, for its name in
French, Groupe Islamique Arme.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the group issued an ultimatum ordering all foreigners
to leave Algeria. It has since been blamed for the deaths of at
least a hundred foreigners there, according to the U.S. State
Department. And members have no regrets for killing women not
wearing the traditional hijab, or veil.
</P>
<P>
   The GIA is thought to operate in autonomous cells, each
commanded by an emir. Its numbers may run into the hundreds or
thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Algeria, the GIA has been blamed for the massacres of
entire villages. There have been reports of women who have been
raped and disemboweled, and babies who have had their throats cut,
then been burned in ovens.
</P>
<P>
   The GIA has declared the government and its supporters, and
civilians who don't oppose the government, its enemies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The seemingly indiscriminate and horrific violence against
civilians _ including women and children _ was condemned widely in
domestic and international circles and eroded Islamic support for
the group abroad,'' the State Department reported last year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the GIA took its campaign to France. Algeria was once a
French colony, and France continues to provides nearly $1 billion
annually to the Algerian government.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were on the A-team of Islamic extremists in France,''
Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   On Christmas Eve 1994, four hijackers with the GIA seized an Air
France jet in Algeria, killed three passengers and rigged 20 sticks
of dynamite on the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Their plan was to blow up the plane, which carried 173
passengers and crew, over Paris. However, the plane landed at
Marseille, where French commandos stormed the plane and killed the
hijackers. The GIA claimed responsibility for the hijacking.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the GIA embarked on a campaign of terror in Paris,
according to French investigators. In July 1995, a subway bombing
in Paris killed seven people and wounded more than 80.
</P>
<P>
   The GIA may be getting sustenance from North America. Police
have warned that a ring of thieves and extortionists in Montreal
may be using their proceeds to help bankroll terrorist groups in
Algeria. Montreal is home to an estimated 15,000 Algerian
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may sound like amateur hour,'' said Harris, ``but it's a
very fundamental way to raise money that kills.''
</P>
<P>
   Groups like the Irish Republican Army have used bank robberies
and other crimes to finance terrorism, he said.

   HOUSTON _ A pair of spacewalking astronauts on Wednesday began
the intricate process of repairing the dormant Hubble Space

Johnson Space Center, said the three new units containing the
crucial gyroscopes necessary to point and steady the telescope had
been activated and seemed to be working properly.
</P>
<P>
   ``All appears at this point to be in good shape with Hubble
essentially back in business,'' Herring said.
</P>
<P>
   The astronauts, Steven L. Smith and John M. Grunsfeld, started
the first of three planned spacewalks at 1:54 p.m., about an hour
earlier than scheduled to tackle the most important and difficult
part of the repair mission.
</P>
<P>
   Stepping out of an airlock as the shuttle Discovery passed over
Australia, Smith, a veteran spacewalker who has flown on two
previous shuttle missions, said to his colleague, ``You ready to
go?'' and added, ``Hubble needs us.''
</P>
<P>
   Grunsfeld, a physicist on his third shuttle flight but a novice
spacewalker, said ``Beautiful sight out here'' as he stepped into
Discovery's cargo bay. ``Hello Hubble,'' he said looking up at the
43-foot observatory towering above him, ``That's one beautiful
telescope.''
</P>
<P>
   Hubble has been out of commission since Nov. 13, when a fourth
gyroscope failed, rendering the telescope incapable of holding
steady enough to conduct scientific observations. The observatory
powered down and went into a protective ``safe mode'' awaiting its
orbital repair crew.
</P>
<P>
   Working from lockers in the payload bay that contain scores of
tools and replacement parts, the astronauts repeatedly carried new
equipment up to the 25,000-pound telescope secured to a cradle
above and brought down old parts that will be returned to Earth for
examination.
</P>
<P>
   After the gyroscope exchange, which took about an hour longer
than expected, the spacewalk team moved to open valves on a cooling
unit attached to a disabled infrared camera to purge nitrogen
coolant. This was to prepare the camera unit, inoperative because
of an earlier coolant leak, for a replacement cooling device to be
installed on a service mission set for 2001. The astronauts
initially could not remove caps covering the valves, but later
forced them off and completed the task.
</P>
<P>
   Next, Smith and Grunsfeld installed voltage regulator kits on
Hubble's six aging batteries. The six Voltage-Temperature
Improvement Kits were designed to improve the batteries' efficiency
while keeping them from overcharging and overheating during periods
of low power use.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a team made up of the NASA astronaut C. Michael
Foale and Claude Nicollier of the European Space Agency is to
conduct the second spacewalk starting in the early afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The astronauts are to replace Hubble's central computer with a
new, faster model and exchange one of the telescope's three Fine
Guidance Sensors with a refurbished unit. These sensors let the
telescope locked onto a target for hours or days at a time.

   ROCK-ERA-SONGS (Undated) _ Here's a little post-holiday exercise
for your amusement: grab pen and paper and jot down your 10
favorite songs dating from 1955 to now. Ponder carefully, or don't,
depending on whether you think music should be judged by the brain
or the gut. Call five friends and read them your list. Set up a
date to argue about it, to spin CDs and scream and shout. When
you've done that, you will have helped shape the canon of rock 'n'
roll. By Ann Powers. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   HURRICANE-FILM (Hollywood) _ Norman Jewison is not Hollywood
hip. At the age of 73, the director of such films as
``Moonstruck,'' ``Fiddler on the Roof,'' ``A Soldier's Story,'' and
``In the Heat of the Night,'' (which won an Academy Award in 1968
as best picture) is hardly on the current A-list of trendy
directors pursued by studio executives and producers. In fact,
executives at Universal Pictures, which is releasing Jewison's
newest drama, ``The Hurricane,'' were skittish about hiring him to
direct the somber drama about Rubin ``Hurrican'' Carter, the boxer
wrongfully accused of murder (portrayed by Denzel Washington.) The
film will open on Wednesday in New York, Los Angeles and a few
other cities in order to qualify for Academy Award consideration.
By Bernard Weinraub. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   MR.-DEATH-FILM (Undated) _ ``Mr. Death: The Rise and Fall of
Fred A. Leuchter Jr.,'' Errol Morris's new film, opens Wednesday.
Fred A. Leuchter Jr., is an earnest dweeb with a thick
Massachusetts accent and a fondness for death chamber technology,
who drinks 40 cups of coffee and smokes six packs of cigarettes a
day, meets his wife-to-be at the local Dunkin' Donuts and then jets
off with her to Auschwitz, and is partial to comments like, ``Every
time there's a gas execution, it's an accident waiting to happen.''

</P>
<P>
   CHINA-FILMS (Beijing) _ These are exhilarating, and perhaps a
bit frightening, times for Zhang Yuan, 36, who is increasingly
described in international film circles as perhaps the most gifted
and original filmmaker of his generation, even though his movies
have not been widely seen at home or abroad. His past films,
including ``Beijing Bastards'' (1992) and ``East Palace, West
Palace'' (1996), were banned in China because they dealt with
hidden subjects like alienated youths and furtive homosexual
encounters. But Zhang's seven feature films, including fiction and
documentaries, have become favorites on the international art-house
and film-festival circuit. Known for years as an intriguing
underground filmmaker, he is now swamped with invitations to appear
at festivals and seminars. By Erik Eckholm. (Moved).

   FILMS-REINVENT (Undated) _ The major film motif of 1999 was
reinvention, both on and off the screen. Characters and filmmakers
alike found significant ways to renew themselves. By Janet Maslin.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   CHASEN-VIDEO (Undated) _ Frozen in time, swimming in
cholesterol, Chasen's restaurant was the very essence of Hollywood
for six decades. When it closed in 1995, the so-called golden age
went with it, or so it was said. By Peter M. Nichols. (Moved).

   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BROADWAY-PLAYS (New York) _ A look at an assortment of Broadway

productions of the same sensibility. By Ben Brantley. (Moved).

<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   HUNGARIAN-DANCE-TROUPE (New York) _ The Budapest Ensemble calls
its touring folk dance program ``Csardas: The Tango of the East.''
A producer of the show readily volunteers comparisons with the
popular Irish revue ``Riverdance.'' Clearly, a few bets are being
hedged here. But scratch the surface of the marketing campaign and
genuine passion and pride are quickly evident. The csardas is not
only the Hungarian national dance, it seems, but an embodiment of
Hungarian soul and the country's respect for dance in all forms.
``Csardas'' opens its monthlong tour of the United States and
Canada on Jan. 14 at the State Theater in New Brunswick, N.J. By
Jennifer Dunning. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   BLACK-CHOREOGRAPHERS (Undated) _ BlAck choreographers,
especially a younger generation, stepped into the spotlight as a
group this year. All had an individual stamp, but many shared an
attraction to African dance movement that they stylized and
absorbed into a personal vocabulary. By Anna Kisselgoff. (Moved).

   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-YEAREND (Undated) _ The year took its time before
delivering its best. The delay is understandable, given the
millennial nature of the moment. Some of the best experiences came
from abroad: from the Salzburg Festival and from festive reopenings
at the Theatre du Chatelet in Paris and the Royal Opera House in
London. But New York may have ended up with the prizes. By Bernard
Holland. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   ELECTRONIC-MUSIC (Undated) _ One thing the 20th century has left
us with is electronic music. The first electrical machines for
making sounds were built just before, but lasting possibilities of
producing music by electronic means arrived and grew during the
century now ending. In the 1920s and '30s came the earliest
electronic instruments that would survive: some are still in
occasional use, including the theremin and the ondes martenot, both
generating the weird effect of voicelike sounds coming from
inexplicable sources, and the electronic organ. By Paul Griffiths.

<P>
   RUBINSTEIN-MUSIC (Undated) _ RCA Red Seal has released Arthur
Rubinsten's entire discography in a deluxe boxed set, ``The Arthur
Rubinstein Collection'': 94 CDs in 82 volumes, more than 106 hours
of music, making it the biggest and most expensive special
collection yet issued. (Retail cost is about $1,300.) Everything is
here: the early HMV recordings; many RCA recordings that have long
been absent from the catalog; all of the many chamber and concerto
performances; recordings of live concerts that were released
commercially; and some items that have never previously been
issued. By Anthony Tommasini. (Moved).

   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ART-SHOWS (Undated) _ The year's handsomest shows of old art, by
medium: bronzes by the sculptor Adriaen de Vries at the Getty,
drawings and paintings by Ingres, and photographs by Carleton
Watkins, both at the Metropolitan. The biggest surprise of the
year: Frank Hurley's photographs, at the American Museum of Natural
History, from Ernest Shackleton's epic 1914 expedition to
Antarctica, one of the great stories of modern exploration, which
turned out to have produced remarkable pictures of the end of the
earth. By Michael Kimmelman. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   NY-ARCHITECTURE (New York) _ For too long, the architectural art
form has been riding on the coattails of architectural preservation
_ coasting on the past, that is to say, instead of generating the
forward movement on which a great city's vitality depends. This
year, however, brought a few welcome signs that New York's
architecture may beg itself from its Sleeping Beauty coma.
By Herbert Muschamp. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   TURKEY-ART (Istanbul, Turkey) _ Rome was ever Rome, and thus
counts as eternal. Istanbul bears a more recent name, but its
history as Constantinople and Byzantium goes back just as far. By
comparison, New York was born yesterday. Which may account for the
uproar over Chris Ofili's ``Holy Virgin Mary'' at the Brooklyn
Museum of Art's much-scrutinized and reviled &UR;  &LR; show ``Sensation.''
Could the same thing have happened on the Bosporus? As it happens,
Ofili was among the 56 artists from 32 countries invited to the
sixth International Istanbul Biennial this fall (Sept. 17-Oct. 30).
His hip, jazzy pieces gave the catalog its most eye-catching pages.
By Matthew Gurewitsch. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TV-MOONLGHTING (Undated) _ It was a match made in hell: she with
the cool gaze and the silky long legs, he with the rhythm-and-blues
soul and that incessant smirk. And from the moment Bruce Willis
called Cybill Shepherd a rude five-letter name and she returned the
compliment with a quick hand across his face, viewers were smitten
by the bickering sweethearts and their television love nest,
``Moonlighting.'' Fifteen years later, their chemistry seems as
potent as ever. Which is exactly what Bravo was banking on when it
acquired 65 episodes of the ABC series and annointed them ``TV too
good for TV,'' an honor already bestowed on 1980s classics like
``Max Headroom'' and ``Brooklyn Bridge.'' Next Sunday at 1 p.m.,
Bravo will introduce its newest addition with a mini-marathon of
the first seven episodes before adding ``Moonlighting'' to its
weeknight lineup at 7 p.m., beginning the next day. By Kathryn
Shattuck. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   TV-YEAREND (Undated) _ Doesn't it seem ``The Sopranos'' has been
around forever? And that the Barbara Walters-Monica Lewinsky
interview became part of pop-cultural history long ago? The
revealing detail about this year's most significant television
events is how quickly they have become absorbed, a testament to the
sound-bite speed of television and the ever-quickening pace of the
world it chronicles and shapes. By Caryn James. (Moved).

   SEATTLE _ Ahmed Ressam, the 32-year-old Algerian man arrested
last week when Customs agents discovered what they said was a cache
of bomb-making components in his rental car moments after he drove
off a ferry from Canada, was indicted by a federal grand jury
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Under heavy security, Ressam was led into the U.S. Courthouse
here, and he listened intently as the proceedings were explained to
him in Arabic by a court translator. Through his lawyer, Tom
Hillier, the chief public defender in Seattle, Ressam pleaded not
guilty to the five counts in the indictment, which charges him with
illegally carrying explosives and making false statements to
customs authorities.
</P>
<P>
   But the indictment made no mention of any broader plot linking
Ressam to any terrorist network. The authorities here and in Canada
say they are looking for others who may have been associated with
Ressam, including an unidentified man who stayed with him for
nearly three weeks in a motel in Vancouver, British Columbia, just
before Ressam left for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Other than briefly saying yes in Arabic to the translator when
he was asked if he understood the charges against him and his pleas
to them, Ressam said nothing during his appearance before a U.S.
magistrate, John Weinberg, who ordered Ressam to remain held
without bail.
</P>
<P>
   Francis J. Diskin, an assistant U.S. attorney, told the
magistrate that the materials found in Ressam's car, including a
nitroglycerine-type chemical, urea powder and timing devices, could
``easily have taken down a building'' had they been assembled into
a bomb.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted of the charges, Ressam could face up to 40 years in
prison. Federal prosecutors may also try to indict him on
additional or superseding charges if they assemble evidence of a
broader conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Hillier declined to discuss any of his conversations with
Ressam. Speaking to reporters outside the courthouse Wednesday
afternoon, he did say of his client: ``He's scared. He's in a
foreign country, in difficult circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Katrina C. Pflaumer, the U.S. attorney in Seattle, declined to
say whether federal officials had concluded that Ressam was part of
a larger plot to set off bombs during the holiday season in the
United States. In characterizing the charges lodged against Ressam
Wednesday, she said: ``This is not a terrorism indictment.''
</P>
<P>
   But she did issue what amounted to an unusual plea to anyone who
might have been involved in such plots to renounce them by
contacting authorities now.
</P>
<P>
   ``For anyone out there with any information about any similar
devices or plots,'' she said, ``we urge them to come forward.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was arrested last Tuesday shortly after driving off the
ferry at Port Angeles, Wash., Ressam possessed two ferry ticket
stubs, prompting some speculation that an accomplice may have
walked off the boat as a foot passenger and taken off once Ressam
was detained. The FBI asked the public for help on Wednesday in
identifying everyone who traveled on the ferry Coho from Victoria,
British Columbia, on Dec. 14, the day Ressam was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   And the hunt for the man who stayed with Ressam in Vancouver,
described by motel employees as a light-skinned man who speaks
English without a discernible accent, continued in both countries
Wednesday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In ordering Ressam held without bail, Weinberg cited the
evidence suggesting that he was carrying material for a powerful
bomb, his outstanding warrants in Canada for theft charges, the
fact that he held plane tickets to leave the United States the day
after he had planned to stay in Seattle, and his use of a fake
passport and Quebec driver's license.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no conditions that can be set that would ensure his
appearance and the safety of the community,'' said Weinberg.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam, a short, slight man with close-cropped black hair,
appeared to listen intently during the brief proceedings,
occasionally rubbing his eyes or the bridge of his nose. He stared
at the magistrate and looked around the room at one point, but he
showed no visible emotions. He was dressed in a light blue
short-sleeved shirt and blue pants.
</P>
<P>
   In Canada, authorities said Wednesday they are continuing to
investigate Ressam's possible ties to a low-level crime ring, based
in Montreal, that is believed to have helped finance an armed
Islamic group seeking to overthrow the Algerian government and
replace it with an Islamic ruling body. Ressam has a criminal
record for petty theft in Montreal, and is wanted on other theft
charges in the province of Quebec.

ANALYSIS: SOME QUESTIONS ON BELL ATLANTIC'S FEAT 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Reed Hundt was asked Tuesday evening to comment on the
Federal Communications Commission's imminent approval of the
application by Bell Atlantic to sell long-distance services in New
York state, his first words were, ``Talk about a
better-late-than-never situation.''
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of the FCC from 1994 to 1997, Hundt was hardly a
champion of the long-distance aspirations of the Baby Bells. He
seemed to believe, in fact, that the local offsprings of Ma Bell
had not opened their networks enough to merit approval.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time the commission formally approved Bell Atlantic's
petition Wednesday, Hundt, like many others in government and
industry, had come to think that the time was right to allow the
first Bell to enter the $80 billion long-distance market since the
break-up of American Telephone &AMP; Telegraph in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic, the second-largest local phone carrier, behind
SBC Communications Inc., clearly went an extra mile beyond earlier,
unsuccessful petitions by the other Bells.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond that, a host of political considerations in
Washington _ led by the Bells' considerable lobbying heft and a
general impatience with the pace of communications deregulation _
had all but ensured that Bell Atlantic's application would at least
receive a sympathetic hearing. Had it been rejected outright, the
very viability of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, a complex
framework for deregulation and increased competition, might have
come into question on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the commission has got the Bell long-distance monkey
off its back and now that Bell Atlantic has won, at least in one
state, what all the Bells have been clamoring for, some new
questions emerge about how consumers will reap the benefits of
enhanced competition and how the telecommunications behemoths will
align themselves to provide it.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious effect of Bell Atlantic's New York victory would
appear to be increased long-distance competition. Last week, the
company could not sell long-distance communications services to the
6.6 million households it serves in New York state. Now it can.
Simple.
</P>
<P>
   One interpretation coming out of the FCC on Wednesday was that
the ruling was also an important validation of growing competition
in local phone markets, the Bells' traditional bastions of monopoly
power. The commission is supposed to evaluate long-distance
applications largely on the basis of the companies' openness to
competitors, so the argument about local competition is a bit
circular. But it holds an important kernel of truth.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic's long-distance approval in New York will almost
surely accelerate the pace of local competition, and as other Bells
get approval in other states, the established long-distance giants
_ AT&AMP;T, MCI Worldcom and Sprint Corp. _ will feel even more urgency
than they do now to counterattack in local markets.
</P>
<P>
   For consumers, that means more choices and, theoretically, a
competitive drive to lower prices and improve the quality of
service. After years of false starts and hot air, AT&AMP;T and MCI
Worldcom, the two biggest long-distance carriers, finally seem
serious about signing up local phone customers in New York. If the
Bells continue to make progress on the long-distance front, AT&AMP;T
and MCI Worldcom may well accelerate their local efforts in other
states.
</P>
<P>
   After at least 18 months of patient work with regulators,
getting long-distance approval in New York was a big deal for Bell
Atlantic, no doubt. But there is also little doubt that in some
important ways the long-distance prize is less valuable now than it
was in 1996, when the Telecommunications Act was passed.
</P>
<P>
   The act held out the long-distance market as the carrot that was
meant to entice the Bells to open their networks to competitors.
But since 1996, a number of vicious price wars have made the core
residential long-distance telephone market much less attractive.
Revenue growth has slowed (or, in AT&AMP;T's case, ended), and it has
become more difficult to maintain profit margins as prices have
continued to fall (though for the long-distance carriers that
process has been offset somewhat by lower per-minute payments to
the Bells for beginning and ending calls).
</P>
<P>
   From Bell Atlantic's perspective, it is next to impossible to
argue with the company's regulatory strategy. Rather than throw a
bunch of half-hearted long-distance applications at the FCC and
hope one might stick, as BellSouth did, Bell Atlantic chose a more
patient, methodical path. And it worked. Bell Atlantic executives
are thrilled at their victory, not least because New York is home
to a disproportionate share of the lucrative international calling
market.
</P>
<P>
   For Bell Atlantic, the New York process may well have gone as
quickly as it could have. But it appears that the prize won at the
end of the process was at least a bit less impressive than the
prize coveted at the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to Bell Atlantic have said the company does not
want to set off an all-out price Armageddon in the long-distance
market. But it may be difficult for the company to sign up the
million long-distance customers it wants in New York by the end of
2000 without provoking a price-slashing response from AT&AMP;T and MCI
Worldcom.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, executives close to Bell Atlantic have said that
the company does not intend to charge monthly fees in connection
with its plans that offer low per-minute rates. If the per-minute
fees are competitive with the best plans from AT&AMP;T and MCI
Worldcom, those two companies would be hard pressed not to
eliminate or cut the monthly fees they already charge.
</P>
<P>
   One possible scenario lurking in the shadows is that the
competition touched off by Bell Atlantic's entry would make New
York's consumer long-distance market so unprofitable that other
Bells might decide not to invest the time and money needed to win
such approvals in the first place.

MISCAST AND TOO-PRETTY, `RIPLEY'S' STILL ADMIRABLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Matt Damon, with his All-American go-getter's intensity, is
often reminiscent of the young Tom Cruise, but with a greater
emotional range. (Even the grin, pulled across an endless expanse
of teeth, is similar.) On the face of it, Damon seems perfect for
Anthony Minghella's adaptation of ``The Talented Mr. Ripley,''
about a young man who sticks himself onto the side of the American
upper crust like a piece of Silly Putty _ slightly tacky but with
the ability to pull away a remarkable resemblance. In that respect,
he's all talent _ and eagerness _ without direction, Nick Carraway
and Jay Gatsby rolled into one.
</P>
<P>
   Two rich New Yorkers hire Ripley to track down their son, who's
living in Italy and squandering his life. Ripley uses the sinuous
bop of 1950s hipster jazz to slip into the world of the son (Jude
Law) and his girlfriend (Gwyneth Paltrow). The jazz gives
``Ripley'' some juice. Particularly the use of the music of Chet
Baker, whose effeminate good looks, tendency to flirt with the
wrong side of the law and almost reflexive ability to exploit those
around him made the singer-trumpeter seem like a real live version
of Tom Ripley. (Perhaps that's why Damon can be heard imitating
Baker's version of ``My Funny Valentine'' on the soundtrack.)
Minghella's interest in burrowing into the heart of romantic love
adds an element of honest sentiment, too.
</P>
<P>
   Novelist Patricia Highsmith's amoral cruiser Tom Ripley has been
brought to the screen before. The book, which was also used as the
source material for the French film ``Purple Noon,'' is all about
appetites. In the book and in ``Purple Noon,'' there is a teasing
undercurrent of homoeroticism. But rather than dance around the gay
element, Minghella ``(The English Patient)'' chooses to be far more
explicit with fabric that was woven in more subtly in previous
versions.
</P>
<P>
   Taking on this role is a sign of Damon's ambition _ almost a
neon sign. His Ripley feels a little unformed, despite Minghella's
filling in the blanks. It's audacious of Damon to set his
reputation on its ear like this. He's working out the character in
front of us, which dispels the vague chill of the original material
(and ``Purple Noon''). But this also makes the center of the movie
feel not quite worked out.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the movie might have been better served had the
roles been reversed. Law, boneless and ``soi disant,'' would've
been a perfect Tom Ripley. He's bulked up here, physically and
spiritually, to play the coarse, spoiled American who gets his
comeuppance at the hands of the man who loved him not wisely, but
too well. It would have been just as daring for Damon to play a
charismatic, landed-gentry jerk made oblivious by old money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ripley'' suffers from another American problem. It's all-that
gorgeous. In fact, it's a little too lush, lost in the glaze of
production design, and it bogs down in an impersonal prettiness.
It's odd to see a tense, tight psychological story with noir
elements given the arty/epic treatment, glamorized to within a
centimeter of its life. But it's an admirable effort.

SPORTS COLUMN: ISN'T ANYONE LISTENING? 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kathy Redmond cried when she first heard the name, and the
horrible story that went with it. This was when the breath of life
was still within Cherica Adams. Rae Carruth, the Carolina Panthers'
wide receiver whose son Adams was carrying, was already implicated
in the shooting by law enforcement in Charlotte, N.C. But where was
the national news media? Where was the outcry?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not until she died, not until Carruth fled, did people pay
attention,'' Redmond said Wednesday. ``Not until it was another
O.J. story.''
</P>
<P>
   Having absorbed the sordid allegations, Sound Bite City was
already moving blindly past the larger lesson and on to fresh, new
outrages, including the rock-headed ramblings this week in a
national sports magazine of the Atlanta Braves' reliever, John
Rocker, on urban diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Not Redmond, though. She wasn't about to let go of the story
that hit home, like a sickening yet somewhat predictable punch to
the stomach.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, what happened, if it's what they're saying it is, is
not shocking,'' said Redmond, the 26-year-old founder of the
growing National Coalition of Women Against Violent Athletes.
``I've been saying that we're going to see a lot more of this until
people start admitting that the situation with athletes is out of
control.''
</P>
<P>
   If Carruth was, as charged, the mastermind of a plot to rid
himself of his pregnant girlfriend, we should make no mistake about
it: This tragedy will not stand alone, based on its sheer
cold-bloodedness. It will, more than anything, have been the
inevitable climax to a late 20th century nightmare of sustained
violence perpetrated by athletes against women. It may be the last
wake-up call to every coach and commissioner, every university
administrator and back-room enabler.
</P>
<P>
   From her desk at the communications position she holds in
Denver, Redmond said that she was, sadly, already seeing the
familiar trappings of how such stories are spun. She was
remembering how athletes are acquitted of crimes at a far greater
rate than anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   She has seen the portrayals of Carruth as a well-meaning, if not
monogamous, soul _ a young man who leaped from the American
underclass into the jock elite world of money and fame. She has
seen the portrayal of Adams as a woman who sought the company of
athletes and partied hard.
</P>
<P>
   If Adams' lifestyle is instructional, it should only be as a
window into the athletes' lives. You hear about the paternity suits
and ask why these guys can't just use condoms. Anyone who has spent
time around famous athletes knows that many regard women in the
same vein _ easily obtainable, utterly disposable.
</P>
<P>
   As a college junior, Redmond stepped forward to charge Christian
Peter with raping her, two weeks after she first arrived at the
University of Nebraska. Peter, then a Cornhuskers star, now with
the New York Giants, was a white kid from the New Jersey suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're speaking to somebody who has heard complaints and
charges of women about men from every race, every class,'' Redmond
said. ``This issue is about guys who are taught to believe they are
above the rules, above the law, no matter where they are from.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked Redmond if she had read Bernard Lefkowitz's 1997 book,
``Our Guys'' (University of California Press). The story of the
1989 rape of a 17-year-old ``educable mentally retarded'' girl by a
gang of high school athletes in affluent Glen Ridge, N.J., was a
chilling condemnation of how our athletically gifted are raised.
</P>
<P>
   She had not read the book, but said, interestingly, that it was
making the rounds at Columbine High in Littleton, Colo. Redmond, a
1991 graduate of that tortured school, was outspoken after last
spring's shootings. She said she believed that the school's
athletes were living in the wild, wild west.
</P>
<P>
   Social scientists will never know how much, if at all, that
figured in the bloodshed. But then, Redmond would argue that the
wrong message continues to be sent. She wonders why $10 million has
been appropriated for a new athletic stadium at the school, while
parents raise money to repair the damage to the shot-up library.
</P>
<P>
   We could ask hundreds of elected officials similar questions.
Few people seem to have the courage or energy to even attempt to
treat the sickness in sports. Redmond, for her part, has developed
``Out of Bounds,'' a proactive program for athletes deemed
potentially violent. She offered it to Columbine, and other schools
in the district. The school board told her it was too expensive and
she was too outspoken.
</P>
<P>
   Now Redmond is talking to the Dallas Cowboys. They are, for now,
listening. She promises to keep talking, until more people listen.

 _ SF CHRON   Bloomberg Uncovers Hush-Hush Stories 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 Chronicle Publishing Company &QC;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
When publicly traded companies have information that will likely
affect their stock price, many of them give that information to big
investors and analysts.
</P>
<P>
   As the fictional tabloid publisher Sid Hudgens said in ``L.A.
Confidential,'' that information is often imparted ``off the
record, on the Q.T. and very hush-hush.'' Only once the stock price
moves does the company then release the news to small investors,
the press and the public.
</P>
<P>
   While the Securities and Exchange Commission contemplates a new
rule change cracking down on that sort of ``selective disclosure,''
Bloomberg News has been hammering the issue for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Bloomberg launched a new category on its proprietary
news terminals. Labeled ``Hush,'' the Princeton, N.J., financial
news service wrote a story every time a company excluded the press
or public from a conference call or investor conference.
</P>
<P>
   Such exclusions happen quite regularly, although that may be
changing, thanks in part to the Internet, and thanks to SEC
Chairman Arthur Levitt, who is pushing for the new rules. And
thanks, also, to Bloomberg and others in the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the bull market of the 1990s, the most disturbing
characteristic has been the unlevel playing field that's developed
between bigger institutions and individual investors,'' Bloomberg
News Editor in Chief Matt Winkler said this week, while in San
Francisco to inspect his troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's necessary to document with depth reporting the most
explicit examples of where selective disclosure has led to some
shareholders having an advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Bloomberg reporters have found their way onto a call
that companies wanted to restrict; firms such as Microsoft, Fane and General Motors have all threatened Bloomberg with lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have welcomed it,'' Winkler said. Even though his
lawyers said he'd lose such a fight, ``I thought, it's better to
lose than to capitulate.''
</P>
<P>
   Not too many people see Bloomberg's ``Hush'' stories, and very
few news outlets pick them up. But the companies know they're
there, and it rankles.
</P>
<P>
   Papers like the Miami Herald did pick up a big  &LR; Bloomberg story
at the end of 1998, Winkler said, that described a lavish
conference in Phoenix conducted by Credit Suisse First Boston, at
which disk-drivemaker Western Digital Corp. revealed it would have
a banner year in 1999, causing its stock to jump 37 percent in one
day _ its biggest one-day gain ever.
</P>
<P>
   Winkler said he's leaned on Levitt at the SEC to pick up the
issue. An SEC spokesman said Levitt's been outspoken on the issue
since February 1998 and is now pushing the new rules, which could
require companies to release information to the SEC or the press at
the same time they give it to analysts and big investors. The rules
would carry monetary penalties.
</P>
<P>
   ``The press has played an important role in shedding light on
this issue,'' said Chris Ullman, director of public affairs at the
SEC.
</P>
<P>
   Some trade associations opposing the new regulations have argued
that requiring equal disclosure will mean less disclosure _ that
companies will be so fearful of accusations of selective disclosure
that they won't disclose anything.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, they argue that while sophisticated Wall Street
analysts can interpret their complex information, individual
investors might overreact.
</P>
<P>
   Neal Lipschutz, a senior editor and columnist for Dow Jones
Newswire, called such a position ``paternalistic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't wash,'' Lipschutz said. ``If someone loses money,
that's their responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he said, the same companies often accuse the
``sophisticated'' analysts of misinterpreting their statements into
something that moves the market.
</P>
<P>
   Dow Jones is among the media firms that have picked up the
crusade. The company, which also publishes the Wall Street Journal,
backed out of Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette's investor conference
earlier this month when it learned that the bank was not allowing
reporters in to cover the presentations.
</P>
<P>
   With the rise of the Internet, more and more companies are
finding it easier to open up their conference calls and
presentations. While only one-third of public companies had done so
a year ago, the figure is now up to 50 percent, said the SEC's
Ullman.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg plans to keep pounding away at the issue, firm in its
conviction it's on the side of open access to information _ an easy
principle for a media watchdog to uphold.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing like transparency to expose something that's
unfair,'' Winkler said. ``That's what makes being a journalist so
much fun.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
MONKEYING AROUND &QL; 
Former San Francisco Examiner reporter Steven Chin seems like the
perfect guy to build a Web portal for Asian Americans, and now he's
going to get the chance.
</P>
<P>
   Chin, who built a journalistic career covering the Bay Area's
Asian American communities, just sold his Web design firm, Monkey
King Media, to A.Media, publishers of A.Magazine: Inside Asian
America. He now has the resources and the platform to launch a
comprehensive site for Asian Americans, to debut next year at the
Web address of www.a-space.com. (That hyphen is not especially
elegant; the company would prefer to have www.a.space.com, but it
would need to buy that address from Space.com, former CNN Moneyline
anchor Lou Dobbs' portal for all things outer space.)
</P>
<P>
   Chin wouldn't disclose how much Monkey King sold for, but he
noted that A.Media just closed a round of angel investor financing
to the tune of $1.5 million, and he'll be able to triple the size
of his staff, now at five people. He'll stay in San Francisco, and
become executive vice president of internet development for New

TA-TA, TISH &QL; 
Just as Upside magazine prepares to substantially beef up its Web
presence, it's losing its star columnist, Tish Williams, to
TheStreet.com.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who wrote the gossipy Daily Tish for www.upside.com,
will write the same sort of column three times a week for TheStreet
starting in January.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 27, started at Upside in a swirl of controversy. She
had written a weekly sex column for the Stanford Daily while an
undergraduate, then took a job as a technical writer for a
telecommunications consulting firm. Upside chief executive David
Bunnell brought her in to add life to the fledgling Web site four
years ago, but some employees quit WHY? &LR;   &LR; and another Web site
published rumors of her outsized salary.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Bunnell said, Williams helped build the foundation
for a successful Web operation _ one that should benefit from a
soon-to-be announced $10 million round of financing. ``She's had a
big role in helping me get the online operation off the ground,''
he said. ``We're sorry to see her go. She'll do really well at
TheStreet.''
</P>
<P>
   TheStreet Editor in Chief Dave Kansas said adding Williams to
his stable of established columnists such as Herb Greenberg and
Adam Lashinsky is a coup. ``One of the big questions about
independent online publications is, can they get the talent?'' he
said. ``We're one of the few that has succeeded in getting
high-profile talent to come on board.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams is excited to join a lineup TheStreet has advertised as
``Murderers' Row.'' As her own fame grows, she quipped, ``Next
year, I'll be bringing out a line of crafts and home accessories.''

Even by the go-go standards of the high-flying New Economy

the roof. In a little over a year, the Herring will have nearly
tripled its staff, from 80 at the start of this year to more than
220 by next year.
</P>
<P>
   The hiring binge went into high gear about two months ago at the
Herring headquarters in the old Hamm's brewery building in
Multimedia Gulch. More than 30 people have been hired, bringing
head count at year's end to 170, according to company president and
CEO Chris Alden. Even as it woos writers away from Forbes, Wired

GENE TRANSFER TECHNIQUE USED IN MONKEYS MAY AID HUMANS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Corrects location of Salk Institute to San Diego. No other

 By GINA KOLATA    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists in Oregon have installed jellyfish genes in monkey
embryos using a technique that might eventually be used to create
monkeys with added human genes, according to a report being
published on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Such a technique would allow those genes to be studied for the
development of treatments for human diseases. But the scientists
say they are acutely aware that their research raises a host of
troubling questions about reproductive technology.
</P>
<P>
   If scientists can add genes to monkey embryos, it should be
possible to add genes to human embryos, raising the emotionally
fraught issue of human genetic engineering.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are matters that need to be discussed,'' said Dr. Barry
Zirkin, who leads the division of reproductive biology at the Johns
Hopkins University School of Public Health in Baltimore, who was
not connected with the Oregon research.
</P>
<P>
   What stands out, some experts said, is how simple the method is.
If it is refined to be highly effective in monkeys, it could be
just a short step to using it to add genes to human embryos.
</P>
<P>
   Some genes might correct diseases or prevent them _ such as an
AIDS resistance gene, or one that might make a person less
susceptible to Alzheimer's disease. Adding such genes might be akin
to vaccinating a child.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of other genes might be more problematic. Dr. Inder
Verma, a molecular biologist at the Salk Institute in San Diego,
who also was not connected with the work, gave the example of a
gene for the glutamate receptor protein in the brain, which may
improve memory.
</P>
<P>
   What if it worked and then humans wanted that gene? ``If
something can be done, people will do it,'' Verma said, though he
added that he was comforted by the thought that there would be very
few people who could afford such genetic engineering, and even
fewer who would want it.
</P>
<P>
   The current study being published Thursday in the journal
Molecular Human Reproduction, is more of a demonstration of
feasibility, experts said. To add genes to monkey embryos, Dr.
Gerald Schatten of the Oregon Primate Research Center at Oregon
Health Sciences University in Beaverton, and his colleagues began
by mixing jellyfish genes with sperm cells from rhesus monkeys. The
genes stuck naturally to the outside of the sperm cells.
</P>
<P>
   Then the scientists tried to use those sperm to fertilize eggs,
asking whether the added jellyfish genes became part of the
developing embryos. The gene encodes instructions for a protein
that gives jellyfish a green glow. If it got into the monkey
embryos and functioned, the embryo cells would glow green under a
fluorescent light.
</P>
<P>
   In one set of experiments, the scientists fertilized about 20
monkey eggs in vitro, mixing sperm and eggs in a petri dish. With
that method, which mimics natural fertilization, the sperm swims tegg and discards its protein coat as it enters. The extra gene
was discarded with the coat as the sperm penetrated the egg. Only
the sperm's genetic material got in.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists also fertilized 81 eggs by directly injecting
them with the gene-containing sperm. Then, they report, the
jellyfish genes entered the eggs with the sperm. The consequence
was clear when the scientists shined a fluorescent light on the
embryos. ``More than a third of the embryos fluoresced,'' Schatten
said.
</P>
<P>
   Using seven of the monkey embryos created by direct sperm
injection into eggs, Schatten and his colleagues tried to create
pregnancies and got a set of stillborn twins and one live male
monkey.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists have not found evidence that the gene was
incorporated into any of the monkeys' cells. But, they and others
say, they have no doubt that the method will work, because it was
recently shown to work in mice.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, in the journal Science, Dr. Ryuzo Yanagimachi
at the University of Hawaii and his colleagues reported that they
had mixed the same jellyfish gene with mouse sperm, injected the
sperm into mouse eggs and created pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   They reported that 11 of the 57 mice that were born had the
jellyfish gene: when they examined cells from the animals' tail
tips under a fluorescent light, the cells glowed green.
</P>
<P>
   Yanagimachi said that while he was disappointed that the first
monkeys did not have the added gene, ``this is just a matter of
time before it can be done.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Monkeys, Schatten said, can be invaluable in studies of human
disorders.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think of their value as a disease model or for
understanding cognition or mental disorders or all sorts of
diseases and disorders that appear in people, this is a very small
first step,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, the experiment raises darker questions about a
popular fertility treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The sperm injection method is a standby in fertility clinics,
where it is used 10,000 to 20,000 times a year in about 200
American clinics. Discovered by accident less than a decade ago,
the method, called intracytoplasmic sperm injection, or ICSI,
revolutionized the treatment of male infertility. It allowed men
whose sperm do not move, men whose sperm cannot penetrate an egg
and men whose sperm are not even ejaculated to become fathers.
</P>
<P>
   But ICSI (pronounced ICK-see) puts whole sperm, along with
whatever may be attached to them, into egg cells. Schatten noted
that viruses can attach themselves to sperm and no amount of
rinsing can get them off. With ICSI, these viruses would be
injected directly into eggs where, his work shows, their genes
could start to function. And while there is no proof so far that
babies born from ICSI procedures have unusual diseases, the
prospect has troubled some scientists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a significant concern,'' said Dr. Peter N. Schlegel, a
specialist in male infertility at the Weill Medical College of
Cornell University. But he noted that most of the monkey embryos
did not take up the genes that Schatten attached to the sperm.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paul Turek, a specialist in male infertility at the
University of California in San Francisco, says he will add the new
information from the monkey experiments when he is counseling
patients who are considering ICSI. ``They can decide whether they
want to go forward or not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Turek added that while he would continue with ICSI for those
who want it, he would not give a blanket recommendation to
everything that becomes technologically possible just because there
is a market for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fall back on the fact that I am an ethical religious man,''
he said. As such, he said, he continually questions where the
boundaries lie.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think technology is forging way ahead of biology,
ethics and common sense,'' Turek went on. ``All of us think about
this all the time. All of the clinicians wonder what we are
doing.''

 Procrastinators Rejoice Over Easy-to-Send E-mail
Holiday  Greetings 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Carrie Kirby &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 Chronicle Publishing Company &QC;  &LR; 
 &LR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &LR; 'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Not a creature was stirring, except for my mouse. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  I selected the image and message with care, &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Clicked ``send,'' and in seconds my cards all were there. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   So you waited until it was too late again, and you can't settle
down for that long winter's nap with the guilt of all those unsent
season's greetings piled on the desk.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get your kerchief in a bundle, Mamma. This is 1999 and the
Internet is there to bail you out.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic greeting cards, cards that you send by e-mail, have
been around for several years, and they're getting easier to use
and more customizable. To send one, you go to an e-greeting site
such as Hallmark.com, choose a card, type in a friend's e-mail
address and a personalized message and click Send.
</P>
<P>
   The way your friend views the card depends on the Web site you
use; some send cards right in an e-mail message, while others send
a link to the card's location on their Web site. Sometimes, the
recipient has to visit the Web site and type in a code number to
retrieve the card. Of course, the easier it is for your friend to
retrieve the card, the more likely it is that he or she will bother
to view it.
</P>
<P>
   It seems like there are more Web sites offering free e-cards
than there are toys in the jolly old elf's sack. And it's not just
Christmas. You can fire off greetings for Kwanzaa, Ramadan, New
Year's and winter solstice just as easily.
</P>
<P>
   You don't hear a lot of people saying they're sending e-cards
instead of paper ones _ maybe it's the stigma of doing something
easy while others are wearing their fingers down to nubs addressing
hundreds of envelopes.
</P>
<P>
   But someone's out there doing it, because Web sites that offer
e-cards surge in popularity every year during the holiday season,
according to Media Metrix. During the week ending December 12,
flowers, gifts and greetings sites grew 36 percent compared with
the week before, more than any other category that Media Metrix
measures. Hallmark.com and Egreetings.com both showed up on Media
Metrix's lists of Web sites with the fastest popularity growth in
November and the beginning of December.
</P>
<P>
   Egreetings.com went public December 17, priced at $10, but its
share price has declined to less than $9. Its visitor count, on the
other hand, has increased 120 percent over this time last year.
</P>
<P>
   As a symbol of this field's success, consider ExciteAtHome's
purchase of Blue Mountain Arts for nearly $780 million earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Media Metrix spokesperson Stacie Leone credits a unique traffic
model for the success of Blue Mountain Arts and other e-cards
sites. ``When you're sent a greeting card, you have to go back to
the site to receive it,'' Leone said. That at least doubles a
site's traffic, and card recipients may stick around to send a card
to someone else, creating a seamless word-of-mouth advertising
force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blue Mountain Arts didn't do any advertising when they started
(in 1996), and look at them now,'' Leone said.
</P>
<P>
   After sending a few e-cards this year, San Francisco resident
Jack Karp said he'll never go back to paper cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sent out 30 or 40 cards in an hour. There's a better range
of cards than you would find in the store _ they even have
interfaith cards that say `Happy Everything.' And if I had done all
those paper cards it would have cost me $30 and taken an entire day
to mail them,'' Karp said.
</P>
<P>
   While some e-cards look a lot like traditional greeting cards,
with a static picture and a space for a personal message, others
are interactive experiences, with animated shorts, music and even
games.
</P>
<P>
   Your e-card experience can be as personal as you want it to be.
Some people pick one picture they like, type in all their friends'
e-mail addresses, slap on a standard greeting, and dispense with
the whole holiday tradition in 10 minutes. Others select a
different image for each recipient or insert a photograph of their
own family, write long personal messages, choose a special tune to
accompany each card, and even manipulate the background color and
font. The end result is a lot more intimate than receiving one of
200 identical cards with a photocopied holiday letter inside.
</P>
<P>
   E-cards can be a lifesaver for Americans living abroad who would
otherwise need to send cards weeks early and invest heavily in
postage. Leslie Burgoine, an American copy editor who lives in
Beijing, sent most of her cards on the Internet this year and
enjoyed the experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only drawback is that you can't decorate with e-cards like
you can with real cards _ you can't really stand them on your
mantel,'' Burgoine said.
</P>
<P>
   You could always print your e-cards on a color printer and tape
them up, but any animation and sound effects are lost. Capturing
e-card images as desktop patterns is easier than printing, but
equally limited.
</P>
<P>
   If you also forgot to buy a present for someone on your list,
the spirit of e-commerce can rescue you there too. Blue Mountain
Arts lets you charge a donation to charity on your credit card and
send someone a note that you have donated in their name. A whole
range of sites, including AOL Shopping and GiftCertificates.com,
let you send a gift certificate by e-mail or print one out directly
from the Web site.

EX-FBI AGENT CHARGED IN DEALINGS WITH MOB FIGURES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHELLEY MURPHY AND JUDY RAKOWSKY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In a stunning blow to the Boston office of the FBI, a
former star agent was charged Wednesday with committing crimes to
protect his prized informants, including tipping off South Boston
crime boss James ``Whitey'' Bulger to a 1995 racketeering
indictment so he could flee.
</P>
<P>
   John J. Connolly Jr., the agent once lionized and lauded by his
superiors for his skill at cultivating top-level informants such as
Bulger and cohort Stephen Flemmi, was named, along with them, in a
five-count federal indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly, 59, was charged with alerting Bulger and Flemmi to
investigations, falsifying reports to hide their crimes, and
funneling $7,000 in payoffs from them to his former supervisor,
John Morris.
</P>
<P>
   Looking nothing like the flamboyant agent who once helped collar
Boston's most notorious Mafiosi, Connolly appeared in court early,
within hours of being arrested by FBI agents at his suburban home
in Lynnfield, where he was suffering from the flu.
</P>
<P>
   Gone were the trademark tailored suits, replaced by a gray sweat
shirt, black jeans, and sneakers, the usually perfectly coiffed
hair matted down.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment of Connolly came just as the five-year statute of
limitations was about to run out on the alleged crime at the heart
of the indictment: the tip to Bulger in December 1994 that he was
about to be indicted, along with his Mafia cohorts, in a landmark
racketeering indictment. Bulger has been a fugitive ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Without that alleged crime, prosecutors would not have been able
to build a racketeering case, since the statute of limitations on
all the other alleged crimes had long since expired.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment of Connolly, now an executive with Boston Edison
Co., is the latest blow to the Boston office of the FBI, which has
been rocked since allegations first surfaced more than two years
ago that former agents may have crossed the line into criminality
in their shadowy dealings with criminal informants.
</P>
<P>
   He pleaded not guilty in US District Court in Boston to
racketeering and obstruction of justice charges that allege he
conspired with Bulger and Flemmi from 1975 to 1995 to protect them
from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Bulger fled five years ago on the eve of the January 1995
racketeering indictment and remains a fugitive. Flemmi has been
jailed without bail since January 1995, awaiting trial in that
case.
</P>
<P>
   Facing reporters at a news conference minutes after Connolly's
arraignment, Barry Mawn, special agent in charge of the FBI's
Boston office, said, ``I am somewhat saddened to learn of these
actions and I am angered.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said the acts of a few should not be used to judge the
many who put their lives on the line every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``These acts do not define today's FBI office or the past FBI
office,'' said Mawn, who was not in charge of the Boston office
during Connolly's tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly left the courthouse without comment after being
released on a $200,000 unsecured bond by US Magistrate Judge
Marianne Bowler. But his attorney, R. Robert Popeo, accused
prosecutors of making Connolly ``a scapegoat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This indictment is nothing short of outrageous,'' Popeo said.
``It will forever be a stain not only on the life of John Connolly,
but on the reputation of the Department of Justice and the FBI.''
</P>
<P>
   Popeo said the case against Connolly flows from the earlier
``ill-conceived'' indictments of Bulger and Flemmi that led to the
public disclosure that Bulger had been an FBI informant since 1975
and Flemmi since 1965.
</P>
<P>
   During lengthy pretrial hearings last year, the FBI's cozy
relationship with Bulger and Flemmi was exposed as US District
Judge Mark L. Wolf considered Flemmi's request to dismiss the case.
Flemmi claimed the FBI assured them they could continue to commit
crimes, short of murder, as long as they provided information about
their Mafia rivals.
</P>
<P>
   A parade of former FBI agents, underworld figures, extortion
victims, as well as Flemmi, testified at the hearings. But Connolly
refused to take the stand, citing his Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination. In numerous press interviews, however, he said
Flemmi and Bulger were given permission to continue their gambling
and loansharking operations while acting as informants, but not the
blanket immunity Flemmi claimed to have.
</P>
<P>
   It was Morris, who was granted immunity from prosecution, who
offered some of the most damning testimony against Connolly during
hearings in federal court last year that unmasked the unholy
alliance among Connolly and Morris and the criminals they had
recruited as informants.
</P>
<P>
   Morris admitted pocketing $7,000 in payoffs from Bulger and
Flemmi and claimed Connolly delivered two payments of $1,000 each,
one tucked in the bottom of a case of expensive wine that Connolly
delivered to Morris in the garage below the FBI's Boston offices,
according to Morris.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly rebutted Morris's allegations at the time, saying: ``In
my entire career with the FBI I never compromised my personal or
professional integrity. If Mr. Morris did so, shame on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the evidence that emerged during the hearings was
pursued by a team of out-of-town FBI agents brought in to
investigate the conduct of Connolly and other agents. The
indictment was returned by a grand jury in US District Court in
Worcester.
</P>
<P>
   US Attorney Donald K. Stern and Mawn stressed that it was at
their request that a task force was convened to investigate the
allegations of FBI misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting five-count indictment charges Connolly, Bulger,
and Flemmi each with two counts of racketeering; Connolly with two
counts of obstruction of justice; and Flemmi with one count of
obstruction of justice.

ON PRO FOOTBALL: MOOD SWINGS AND ALL, MOSS RULES
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Where Randy Moss goes, a crowd will follow. On the
field, it is usually an army of defensive backs trailing him like
puppies. Off the field, there may be no athlete in professional
football whose every word, movement or action is dissected like
those of Moss, the moody Minnesota Vikings wide receiver who is
redefining his position.
</P>
<P>
   Moss is fretted over like a grandmother crossing a busy street.
When he sneezes, the owner of the Vikings catches a cold.
</P>
<P>
   And on Monday night outside of the Metrodome, it was freezing
cold, about minus 4. Balmy for Minnesota this time of year. But
Moss was sweating, because inside the steamy locker room it was 80
degrees warmer and he was still perspiring from yet another
impressive game. It was a performance that would make even the most
cynical, hardened football observer simply say, ``Wow.''
</P>
<P>
   Moss is being chased again, this time by the news media, which
have surrounded him, circling, waiting to hear what he has to say
as he squeezes his wiry 6-feet-4 inch frame into that tiny space.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Green Bay Packers on Monday, he had five catches for
131 yards and two touchdowns, again showing up big in a big game.
This is becoming the Moss way. The larger the stakes, the quicker
he comes out of that telephone booth sporting his purple helmet and
cape. The only thing missing is X-ray vision.
</P>
<P>
   Moss, who will test the New York Giants on Sunday at the
Meadowlands in a crucial game for New York, fielded questions
mostly about the game; but a few were about Moss' strange demeanor
these last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   This may come as a surprise to some, but Randy Moss gets bored,
even on the field, even with all of that furious action going on
around him.
</P>
<P>
   He tires of sitting all day in hotel rooms, on game day, waiting
for the game to begin. He gets irked when the ball does not come
his way. He mopes. He pouts. He boycotts the local news media.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings' owner, Red McCombs, a less overbearing version of
the Washington Redskins' owner, Daniel Snyder, challenged Moss'
recent habits on the field, which have been erratic. Moss has
seemed uninterested and frustrated at times; he will make a blazing
touchdown catch one minutes, then a few minutes later will fumble a
punt return. McCombs asked Moss, publicly, to display more of the
``spectacular'' and less of the ``garbage.''
</P>
<P>
   The response? ``He's our owner; he owns me,'' Moss said. ``He
owns this team. He owns our coaches. He owns coach Green, and I
think he's entitled to say anything he wants to.''
</P>
<P>
   Moss admitted that he has not been completely into football for
much of the last half of the season, which is scary, because this
year he set a team record with six 100-yard receiving games. He has
10 touchdown catches, making Moss and Cris Carter the only players
in Vikings history to have consecutive 10-touchdown seasons. His
1,214 receiving yards after 14 games are also a team record.
</P>
<P>
   This is disinterested? The Giants would take 10 years of Moss'
disinterest.
</P>
<P>
   What Moss has demonstrated more than anything is exasperation,
and such bouts tend to make him seem spoiled. The best example of
this happened against Tampa Bay on Dec. 6, when Moss turned his
back to the sideline while Buccaneers defensive back Donnie Abraham
was returning an interception.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two weeks, Moss has dropped seven passes and has
fumbled three times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wasn't into my game recently,'' he said. ``I was
moping around. I was always wondering if we were going to get the
ball to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Moss was asked to explain further. ``I really don't want to say
`bored,''' he said. ``I think I'm just being too relaxed. There
have been times when I've been bored, just dragging along and stuff
like that, on the field and off the field. I don't think I've been
moping around in a bad way. It's just how I feel on game day.''
</P>
<P>
   Moss also said that one of the toughest things he has to do is
sit in his hotel room all day waiting for the game to start. His
lower back apparently has been stiffening, and the waiting,
especially on the road, takes its toll on his concentration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laying in that hotel bed all day, my back has been bothering
me,'' he said. ``It has been hard for me to get motivated.''
</P>
<P>
   Moss is a strange mix of superstar and simple man. He still uses
words like ``golly'' when talking, but is becoming a well-known
commercial commodity. His face is increasingly popping up on the
tube.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that Moss is experiencing a sort of sophomore slump,
though it seems ridiculous that such a label would apply,
considering the tremendous year he is having. But this is a
different Moss than the one who burst onto the scene as a rookie
last season. Moss still has not adjusted to the fact that as great
as he is, he is still just one of many weapons on the Vikings
offense. He will never again be the only weapon, like he was at
Marshall University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy has had a good year,'' Dennis Green said. ``He's not
perfect. He hasn't had a perfect season, but he is a tremendous
player and he's a weapon returning kicks.''
</P>
<P>
   Green has not received enough credit for making the smart
decision to use Moss on punt returns. The same way Deion Sanders
causes the entire stadium to hold its breath when he lines up for a
return, Moss is having the same effect.
</P>
<P>
   Green was asked if he fears losing his star player to punt
returns, the way the Giants lost cornerback Jason Sehorn for all of
last season to a knee injury while returning punts.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Green said. ``Jason was a defensive player making the
adjustment to an offensive type of position. Randy has been playing
offense his entire life. That does make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   That is Moss: a difference maker. No one scares a defense like
he does. Which means a lot of teams will be frightened for a long
time to come.

ADVERTISING: KODAK GIVES ITS TIMES SQUARE BILLBOARD A FACE LIFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By COURTNEY KANE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One of the original extravagant signs at the
crossroads of the world has undergone a face lift to keep up with
its glitzy high-technology neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   After 15 years, Eastman Kodak Co. recently renovated its
billboard, which has been a fixture in Times Square since it was
designed as part of the exterior of the Marriott Marquis Hotel on
Broadway between 45th and 46th Streets.
</P>
<P>
   The gigantic billboard _ which outdoor-advertising executives
refer to as spectaculars _ has always featured an illuminated image
of stunning photography accompanied by the Kodak logo. Now, the new
sign, which is 52 feet high by 70 feet wide, is not only 20 percent
larger than its predecessor but is brighter and features a
state-of-the-art Sony Jumbotron screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Signage in Times Square has been changing dramatically over
the past several years,'' said Mike Ianzito, director for marketing
communications at Eastman Kodak, which is based in Rochester. ``It
was really our goal to bring it up to current times. With all the
advances in technology, we decided to recreate the Kodarama with a
completely new concept in lighting and imagery.''
</P>
<P>
   The new 1,800-square-foot Kodak image area, which the company
refers to as the Kodarama, is divided into three areas: a 15-by-60
foot primary display that takes up the lower half featuring
eye-catching photographs like those its predecessor displayed over
the years. In the upper right portion is the Sony Jumbotron video
screen. And the other section is either used as an extension of the
main display or to show images of Kodak products and promotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the new video capability, we can show our commercials or
do live telecasts from the Olympics or other venues,'' Ianzito
said. In addition, Kodak will be able to create direct links to its
Web site, displaying Web pages like Kodak Photoquilt, where
consumers send in their most meaningful photos.
</P>
<P>
   The content of the billboard, created by the New York office of
the Ogilvy &AMP; Mather Worldwide unit of WPP Group, will ideally
change every few months or so, Ianzito said. But through January
the display will feature Kodak's ``millennium gallery,'' which will
cycle through images of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   The entire image area features a black-and-white aerial view of
a construction worker waving from a girder above the Manhattan
skyline in the 1930s. The picture remains for five seconds, then
the screen dissolves into a three-minute slide show of images from
famous to everyday moments in this century. At various times, title
cards state: ``A picture speaks so loudly . . . just listen.''
</P>
<P>
   One image, for instance, is Winston Churchill flashing his ``V''
for victory sign, fading into Mickey Mantle with his four fingers
up in the air signifying a grand slam home run, to President
Richard M. Nixon bidding farewell in front of a helicopter. Those
famous moments in 20th century history, which are in no particular
order, are interspersed with ordinary moments like people at the
beach in the 1920s or a picture of a family having dinner.
</P>
<P>
   The renovation of the sign is indicative of the ever-changing
Times Square landscape. The Kodak sign is the second spectacular to
be revamped, after the transformation of the Coca-Cola billboard
eight and a half years ago. In the mid-1980s, those two were the
only major American companies with billboards in Times Square, when
the area's bleak, seedy appearance discouraged tourists and New
Yorkers alike.
</P>
<P>
   But over the years, the improvements in Times Square's economic
and physical health transformed the lineup of marketers planting,
or replanting, their brands on billboards there. And the square is
now bursting with electronic spectaculars that feature huge video
screens, message centers, electronic strips or ribbons, printed
vinyl that changes and, of course, flashing neon.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Forte, chief executive of Spectacolor Communications
Inc. in New York, which specializes in Times Square signs and is
handling Kodak's job, said: ``Everybody gives the credit to Disney
as the turning point to Times Square. But Times Square has always
been Times Square. It was always an entertainment mecca. Although
it had its slow days, I think people always wanted Times Square to
come back.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``great signs'' in the square now have three components in
common, Forte said. ``They all have something that is permanent for
the corporate name. They all have something that is spectacular,
and something that is changeable.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Kodak nor Spectacolor would disclose the cost of the
Kodak sign or discuss the multiyear contract to lease the space.
However, leases usually cost millions, plus there are millions more
to build, operate and maintain the billboards. &QL;

U.S. WINS ROUND IN TRADE WAR WITH EUROPE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The World Trade Organization has backed the United
States in a trade battle with Europe, ruling that Washington can
still use a much-contested law to take retaliatory measures against
nations it deems guilty of unfair trade practices.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling is a narrow but important victory for the United
States. The Clinton administration suffered a humiliating blow in
Seattle earlier this month, when it hosted global trade talks that
collapsed amid sometimes violent street protests and sharp
disagreements among major trading partners.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials had worried that if the trade organization ruled
against the United States and demanded that it change domestic
trade laws, some members of Congress, as well as unions, consumer
and environmental groups, would have new reasons to attack the
Geneva-based trade group and thwart Washington's hopes of beginning
a new round of world trade liberalization.
</P>
<P>
   A report by a trade organization panel released Wednesday in
Geneva found that Section 301 legislation, which empowers the
United States to impose sanctions against foreign governments in
trade disputes, does not violate international trade agreements.
The European Union and many other countries that joined Europe's
case have long argued that the United States uses the law to punish
countries unilaterally, flying in the face of international trade
norms.
</P>
<P>
   The case, brought in late 1998, was a response to Washington's
action in a dispute over Europe's rules on importing bananas. The
trade organization sided with the United States in that dispute.
But under Section 301 Washington began taking retaliatory action _
drawing up a list of European exports to be taxed at punitive rates
_ before the trade organization gave the go-ahead.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Washington did not impose the sanctions until it got
trade organization approval. The ruling on the validity of Section
301, which can be appealed, suggested that the United States can
take retaliatory steps against unfair trade practices provided that
the law is not used to circumvent the trade organization, trade
experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have maintained all along that Section 301 is consistent
with our WTO obligations, and are pleased that the panel concurs,''
Charlene Barshefsky, the U.S. trade representative, said in a
statement. ``Section 301 has served, and will continue to serve, as
a cornerstone of our efforts to enforce our international trade
rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Section 301 has rankled America's major trading partners since
Congress first passed the law in 1974. During trade battles with
Japan in the 1980s and early 1990s, for example, the United States
used the law to retaliate against what it called Japan's predatory
trade practices, prompting Japan to complain that Washington was
taking international trade rules into its own hands. Japan was
among the 16 countries that joined as third parties in Europe's
case against the United States.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Any trade organization ruling in favor of Europe in this case
would have been a double blow to the Clinton administration, which
has not only sought to protect the law but also to strengthen the
tepid support for the trade group. In Seattle, opponents of the
administration's trade agenda orchestrated a large protest against
globalization. One key charge: the trade organization violates the
sovereignty of member nations by forcing them to repeal laws that
restrict trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Psychologically it's a very important victory,'' said Claude
E. Barfield, a trade policy expert at the American Enterprise
Institute. ``Otherwise you would have had people saying that it's
another example of the WTO ruling against us.''

<P>
   BEIJING _ On a recent evening, Zhang Aijing sat at her terminal
at the Internet division of People's Daily, watching comments drop
from cyberspace into the Communist Party newspaper's chat room.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Zhang is an ``editor'' assigned to ``anchor'' discussions,
and her responsibilities include weeding out comments overly
critical of the party. With a click of her mouse, ugly thoughts
disappear.
</P>
<P>
   She had just posted a notice on the site about a Western
reporter's visit and was watching intently to see what came in.
After all, unpredictable things happen here, where party propaganda
meets cyberspace and, as if to underscore that point, a screen
saver flashes smiling images of Diana, Princess of Wales, her
wedding and Prince William nearby.
</P>
<P>
   `'The U.S. is a killer _ we can't forget May 8,'' comes the
first reply, referring to the day last spring when NATO forces
bombed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade. Most Chinese reject NATO's
explanation that the attack was an accident. More angry comments
tumble in.
</P>
<P>
   But soon another message hits the screen: ``I want her to know
that we Chinese people don't like our government.'' And another:
``The Communist Party doesn't let Chinese people read newspapers
from overseas.'' The comments stand.
</P>
<P>
   `'We try to let the people speak,'' said Jiang Yaping, who heads
the Internet division, with a shrug. ``We are the main newspaper of
the party, so of course there are limits. But it would take
something much stronger than these to be removed.''
</P>
<P>
   With the ambivalent blessing of the government, locally produced
Web sites and chat rooms have spread rapidly here in the last two
years, giving China's estimated 7 million Internet users a forum
for public debate and discussion _ even a degree of dissent _ that
previously was unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   On the local Internet, Chinese are exposed to information and
opinions that could never appear in the tightly controlled Chinese
media, on topics like the crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in
Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989, and the mistreatment of people
with AIDS. Local governments are even using Web sites to poll
residents about policy issues, like bus fares.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is changing China,'' said Minxin Pei, a
researcher at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in
Washington. ``Now we have people voting in cyberspace who cannot
vote in political space. That will certainly have an effect.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a delicate balancing act for China's leaders and for the
commercial Web sites. They must preserve the sense of freewheeling
openness that makes the Internet so popular while maintaining the
control over information and dissent that the Communist government
requires.
</P>
<P>
   For the government, the Internet has been, at times, a useful
tool: after the embassy bombing in Belgrade, for example, chat
rooms gave Chinese an outlet for their anger. But it is clearly a
double-edged sword. The banned Falun Gong spiritual group, whose
leader is now based in New York, has frequently used e-mail and the
Internet in its campaign for legal recognition and to help mobilize
its followers, although its Web sites are now blocked.
</P>
<P>
   This month, Information Minister Wu Jichuan announced that
government ministries would monitor Internet sites, but he did not
elaborate on what form that monitoring would take.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not allow the introduction of trash that is harmful to
the people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To experts, it is no surprise. ``I expect that the government
will be very deeply involved in regulating the Internet, for two
reasons,'' said Kenneth DeWoskin, a partner at
PricewaterhouseCoopers who spoke at a recent conference on the
Internet at Beijing University. ``The Chinese government has always
had a strong interest in managing information. And also, the
government has a strong commercial interest in the Net; it's a
major owner.''
</P>
<P>
   But control over a multi-headed, constantly morphing creature
like the Internet is difficult to achieve, as Chinese censors have
already learned. Although the government now restricts access to a
number of foreign Web sites, many technically savvy Beijingers know
how to get around the barricades.
</P>
<P>
   To get to The New York Times on the Web or to sites related to
Falun Gong, for example, Chinese who know the proper codes can dial
a device called a proxy server, which effectively masks the
identity of the site being visited. Some government officials use
proxy servers to read the Times Web site.
</P>
<P>
   But domestic Web sites face a great deal more direct pressure,
from readers hungry for the broadcast of more information and from
a government that wants less.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Sina.com is one of China's most popular Web sites, featuring a
creative blend of features, sports and entertainment. It runs
celebrity chat rooms, where Internet surfers can ``meet'' people
like the film director Zhang Yimou. This fall it made waves by
displaying China's first online birth: surfers could follow the
prenatal development and birth of a real baby called Dian Dian.
</P>
<P>
   But one of Sina.com's special strength is news, and that
requires especially deft handling.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike China's newspapers and magazines _ which are owned and
controlled by the government _ Sina.com is the product of a private
Chinese company, the Stone Group, which has offices in Beijing,
Hong Kong, Taiwan and California.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not under the media control of the Chinese
government,'' said Paul Jin, the executive deputy general manager
of Sina.com in Beijing. ``Still, we have to be very careful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to make sure that every article is suitable to the
Chinese government,'' Jin added, noting that the Sina.com's
mainland China Web site contained different offerings from its
Chinese-language web sites overseas. ``We make our own judgments.
News here has great value, but it also has risks.''
</P>
<P>
   When it started up just over a year ago, Sina.com included
dispatches from foreign news agencies, including Agence
France-Presse and Reuters. But after the government reiterated that
its own newspapers were not permitted to use text directly from
foreign news organizations, Sina.com dropped the practice as well.
Today, it writes some of its own dispatches but mostly buys copy
from the Chinese press.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Many private Web sites in China avoid news that has not been
sanctioned by the government, especially political news, even
though urban Chinese are inveterate news junkies and there is great
market demand.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Dow Jones Co. is a major shareholder in Sohu.com,
popular Chinese general-interest Web site, the site offers only Dow
Jones' business and financial news, not its broader news service.
</P>
<P>
   But it is in the chat rooms that the dicey stuff appears. ``We
don't worry too much about news items,'' Jin said. ``It's the chat
rooms that make us really nervous. Especially around sensitive
days, like June 4, we have to screen very carefully, since you
never know what will appear.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At Sina.com and People's Daily, the goal is ew all
comments within minutes after they drop and remove those deemed
inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   The People's Daily chat room got government permission to go
online on May 8, the day of the embassy bombing in Belgrade,
provoking an outpouring of popular anger. The chat room had already
been months in planning.
</P>
<P>
   The government ``thought that people had a lot to say at that
time,'' said Jiang, explaining the timing, ``although some people
criticized us for allowing this kind of discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he said, leaders have becoming increasingly
supportive of the enterprise, since the chat room, which gets more
than 2,000 visitors a day, gives citizens a chance to vent their
anger and also for China's officials to stay in touch with popular
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   But the heated chat room debates that occurred on many Chinese
Web sites in the month after the bombing showed that the Internet
could buttress, but also occasionally undercut, government policy.
</P>
<P>
   In early May, for example, most of the entries were attacks on
the United States, NATO and President Clinton, reflecting the
widespread view that the Chinese Embassy had been deliberately
chosen as a target.
</P>
<P>
   But by the end of the month, the anniversary of the June 4,
1989, crackdown in Tiananmen Square was fast approaching. Along
with thousands of patriotic entries, a few more controversial
thoughts occasionally made their way online _ if only for a few
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   On the chat room Netease, which was devoted to the embassy
bombing, one person ventured: ``June 4 is coming. What do you
think?'' The events of June 1989, when tanks moved into central
Beijing, killing hundreds of civilians, are among China's ultimate
political taboos.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, in a People's Daily chat room on AIDS run by an
expert from the Health Ministry, viewers got official statistics
(via the expert) as well as a embarrassing account (courtesy of a
Net surfer) of how a Chinese deputy health minister had been
heckled as he left the stage at a recent International AIDS meeting
in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Chinese take advantage of the relative anonymity provided by the
Internet to say things they might not utter in other public forums.
Although it is theoretically possible for a chat room to tell what
phone number a comment is coming from, many Chinese gain access to
the Internet through Internet cafes and it would be difficult to
connect a particular comment with a particular individual, experts
said.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts say that the quick growth of the Internet will push
the Chinese media to be more open _ and that it has done so
already.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is very international, and with the Net you
really cannot construct obstacles to prevent people from knowing
things,'' said Jiang, of People's Daily. ``So often it's better
that we inform people about something rather than have them learn
about it elsewhere. But we stand on behalf of the Chinese
government, and in some areas it better for us to keep quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   For the foreseeable future, the Chinese government will
certainly continue to try to exert control over the beast that has
been unleashed. But monitoring every entry in every chat room will
become increasingly cumbersome as the number of Internet users in
China grows.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a problem for us,'' Jiang said. ``Right now, we don't
know just what we will do.''

MARKET PLACE: MANNESMANN-VODAFONE FIGHT TAKES ON DECIDEDLY AMERICAN
TONE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The battleground for the struggle between Mannesmann
A.G., the German telecommunications conglomerate, and its unwanted
suitor, Vodafone AirTouch of Britain, may be in Europe, but it has
all the trappings of a Wall Street scuffle, complete with Wall
Street investment bankers and tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Upset by the refusal of Mannesmann's board to negotiate with
Vodafone, a prominent American arbitrager who has bought shares in
Mannesmann said Wednesday he would wage a campaign to oust the
company's management if it did not seek to strike a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Guy Wyser-Pratte, the Wall Street investor known for his
penchant for starting proxy fights against management boards he
considers obstinate, said he would immediately begin seeking powers
of attorney from Mannesmann shareholders to vote to withdraw
confidence from Mannesmann's management and to convene a special
meeting if they refused to negotiate with Vodafone, the British
mobile phone operator.
</P>
<P>
   Wyser-Pratte's move came as Chris Gent, Vodafone's chief
executive, was preparing to present the company's formal offering
document to Mannesmann and its shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   That presentation, set for Thursday, officially begins
Vodafone's all-stock bid, which was worth $127.7 billion when first
made a month ago and is now worth substantially more because the
share values of both companies have risen. Vodafone has said it
would exchange 53.7 of its shares for each Mannesmann share.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vodafone has a lucrative bid on the table and they say they
are willing to talk and these Mannesmann fellows say: `fortress
Germany,''' Wyser-Pratte said in a phone interview from his office
on Wall Street. ``Our hope is that Mannesmann will do the right
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann officials have called Vodafone's offer too low, and
the company's chief executive, Klaus Esser, has said he does not
want to merge with Vodafone regardless of price.
</P>
<P>
   As an arbitrager, who makes a living by buying and selling
shares based on where he thinks their value is headed, Wyser-Pratte
has a vested interest in seeing Mannesmann reach an agreement with
Vodafone; he bought shares of Mannesmann hoping that the company
would be sold to Vodafone at far more than he paid. Wyser-Pratte
would not say how many shares of Mannesmann he owns or what they
cost him.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for Mannesmann and Vodafone declined to comment on
Wyser-Pratte's plan to pressure the Mannesmann board.
</P>
<P>
   Several Mannesmann shareholders here and in the United States,
who spoke on the condition on anonymity, said they were unsure
Wyser-Pratte would be able to persuade enough shareholders to kick
out Mannesmann's board.
</P>
<P>
   But at the very least, they said, he might create shareholder
resentment toward the company's management, depending on how
Mannesmann deals with his threat. If it treats him dismissively,
they said, that may be regarded as a sign of arrogance that could
ultimately create support for Vodafone.
</P>
<P>
   Wyser-Pratte pledged to ``introduce a withdrawal-of-confidence
resolution at the Year 2000 ordinary shareholders meeting, if the
extraordinary meeting is not held in a timely fashion.'' For
Wyser-Pratte to even call a special meeting, he needs to persuade 5
percent of Mannesmann's shareholders to vote for one. Wyser-Pratte
has hired Innisfree M &UR;  &LR; &AMP; &UR;  &LR; A, a firm that specializes in proxy
soliciting, to help him rally shareholders to call the special
meeting. It is unclear how many votes Wyser-Pratte would need to
win to oust Mannesmann's board.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the chances of calling a meeting are excellent,''
Wyser-Pratte said. ``Just look at the stock price,'' he added,
noting that Mannesmann shares are still trading for less than
Vodafone's offer price.
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann stock closed Wednesday at 231.15 euros, or about
$233, a share, while Vodafones offer values the company at 254
euros, or about $256.54, a share.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of both Mannesmann and Vodafone fell Wednesday.
Mannesmann dropped 2.7 percent. Vodafone fell 1.75 pence, to 296.75
pence, or about $4.78, a share.
</P>
<P>
   Wyser-Pratte is not the first Mannesmann shareholder to try his
hand at persuading the company to negotiate with Vodafone, though
he is the first to do it through a proxy fight.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, three German shareholders tried to prevent
Mannesmann from opposing Vodafone's offer in a lawsuit, but a
German court rejected the shareholders' case.

RUTH WELTING, 51, A SOPRANO ADMIRED FOR COLORATURA ROLES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Tenn.)  (js) 
 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ruth Welting, a soprano who sang a wide variety of roles at the
Metropolitan Opera between 1976 and 1994, died on Dec. 16 at her
home in Asheville, N.C. She was 51.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cervical cancer, said her manager, Robert
Lombardo.
</P>
<P>
   Through most of her career, Ms. Welting was admired for the
strong upper register that allowed her to play coloratura roles
with an unusual fluidity. Among her specialties were the Queen of
the Night in Mozart's ``Zauberfloete,'' Olympia in Offenbach's
``Tales of Hoffmann'' and Zerbinetta in Strauss' ``Ariadne auf
Naxos,'' all of which she sang at the Met. Zerbinetta was her debut
role in 1976, as it had been at the Royal Opera in Covent Garden in
London in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   She also gave notable performances as the Fairy Godmother in
Massenet's ``Cendrillon'' in Paris, Washington and San Francisco,
and Marie in Donizetti's ``Fille du Regiment'' in Barcelona and
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Welting was born in Memphis in 1949 and studied voice
privately with Daniel Ferro in New York, Luigi Ricci in Rome and
Jeanne Reiss in Paris. In 1968 she was a winner of the Metropolitan
Opera National Council Auditions, and in 1970 she made her debut at
the New York City Opera as Blonde in Mozart's ``Abduction From the
Seraglio.'' She was also praised for her City Opera performances as
Zerbinetta and as Gilda in Verdi's ``Rigoletto.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Ms. Welting began quietly cutting back on her
performances, having grown disillusioned with the music business
and tired of repeating the roles she had been singing for 20 years.
Intent on pursuing a more recent interest in government and foreign
affairs, she entered Syracuse University in 1994 and graduated in
1998 with a degree in liberal studies. She was continuing her
studies at the Maxwell School of Government at Syracuse University
at the time of her death.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Welting is survived by her mother, Mary Frances Welting, and
two sisters, Rozelind Merryman and Elizabeth Childers, all of
Memphis.

N.J. MAN ARRESTED IN BOMB THREAT TO NEW YORK CITY TUNNELS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By KEVIN FLYNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The authorities posted police officers and
bomb-sniffing dogs at several tunnels leading into New York City on
Wednesday morning after a New Jersey man posted a threatening
message on the Internet saying that a van filled with explosives
would be left in a tunnel leading into the city, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents later arrested a Newark, N.J., man, Renato
DeSousa Flor, and charged him with having sent the threatening
message to a chat room operated by America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Although no explosives were recovered at Flor's home, the
authorities had taken the threat seriously and earlier in the day
had assigned the police to check trucks entering the Holland and
Lincoln Tunnels from New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   America Online contacted the authorities after reading the
threatening message, and members of the Joint Terrorism Task Force
arrested Flor at his home, according to an FBI statement released
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet message had been posted early Wednesday to an
e-mail address used by Flor, according to the criminal complaint.
</P>
<P>
   In the complaint, FBI Agent Jeffrey A. Farrar said the message
warned the FBI and CIA that a blue van with explosives, accompanied
by two cars, would be parked sideways in the middle of a tunnel.
``Then the driver will get inside one of the cars and exit the
tunnel,'' the message said.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear from the complaint whether the threat had
specified a particular tunnel, but the FBI statement said the
message had specified the Holland and Lincoln Tunnels. The
complaint said Flor had admitted sending the e-mail message.
</P>
<P>
   The rapid response to an Internet threat was an indication of
how carefully the authorities are taking security precautions for
the millennial New Year's Eve celebration. But New York officials
have said they have not received any credible threats against the
city.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no guarantees against terrorism when you live in a
free society,'' Police Commissioner Howard Safir said at a news
conference Wednesday. ``But I believe that we are doing everything
humanly possible to make sure that it is a safe and enjoyable
millennium celebration for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Safir said 35,000 police officers, double the usual number, are
assigned to work during the celebration, which will last until 6
a.m. on New Year's Day. In addition to confiscating open containers
of alcohol, Safir said the officers would look out for people
carrying ``packages, knapsacks and briefcases that may be
suspicious.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, ``we will be doing lots of sweeps with
both dogs and other equipment to make sure that all of the venues
that are going to be used are safe.''

SHUTTLE ASTRONAUTS ACCOMPLISH CRUCIAL HUBBLE REPAIRS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Floating outside the Hubble Space Telescope,
spacewalking astronauts from the shuttle Discovery on Wednesday
accomplished the major task of restoring the observatory's disabled
pointing system.
</P>
<P>
   The effort is expected to allow scientists next month to resume
studying the frontiers of space. Launched in 1990, Hubble is one of
the world's most powerful astronomical observatories.
</P>
<P>
   Astronauts Steve Smith and John Grunsfeld replaced the
telescope's six faltering gyroscopes during the spacewalk that
lasted about eight hours.
</P>
<P>
   The gyro exchange was the most important assignment for
Discovery's eight-day Hubble repair mission that began earlier this
week. The seven-man shuttle crew rendezvoused with the 42-foot-long
telescope late Tuesday, securing it in the ship's cargo bay with
Discovery's robot arm, setting the stage for the first of the
mission's three spacewalks.
</P>
<P>
   ``All appears at this point to be in good shape, with Hubble now
essentially back in business with six new gyroscopes,'' said NASA
spokesman Kyle Herring, as commands from ground controllers
confirmed a proper installation by the spacewalkers. A more
elaborate evaluation of the work was planned overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Hubble observations came to a halt in mid-November as the
telescope experienced its fourth gyro failure in two years, sending
the instrument into an electronic slumber. The fast revving
turbines in the small gyroscopes are a crucial component of a
pointing mechanism that enables the 12.5-ton instrument to be aimed
at celestial targets selected by ground-based astronomers with
unprecedented precision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a beautiful sight out here, beautiful day,'' said Smith
as he emerged from Discovery's airlock shortly before 1 p.m. CST to
kick off the first excursion.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle sped more than 360 miles over the Pacific Ocean west
of Australia as Smith surveyed his new surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello, Hubble,'' gasped Grunsfeld, who traded a career as an
astronomer to become an astronaut. ``That's a big telescope.''
</P>
<P>
   The two men purposefully began what was to be a six-hour
spacewalk nearly an hour early. They were hopeful the head start
would enable them to recover some of the repair tasks dropped from
the flight as Discovery lifted off Sunday after a record nine
launch delays. In order to complete the flight before New Year's
Eve and a potential Y2K conflict, mission managers trimmed the
flight from 10 to eight days and cut the number of spacewalks from
four to three.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy proved wise as the nearly three hours alloted for
the gyro replacement took almost four hours. At times, the men
struggled with the demanding, hand-intensive work.
</P>
<P>
   The cupboardlike doors of a large enclosure at the base of the
telescope housing the gyros proved difficult for the astronauts to
open, slowing their efforts. Then some of the bolts securing the
three toaster-sized assemblies holding the six gyros resisted the
first efforts by the spacewalkers to remove them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Got some curve balls, got some knuckle balls today,'' Smith
muttered at one point.
</P>
<P>
   Working as a team, Smith leaned into the telescope enclosure on
his back, while Grunsfeld held his weightless colleague in place at
the feet. Using battery-powered ratchets, they removed one gyro
assembly and replaced it with a new one before moving to the next.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers believe the older gyros failed as hair-thin electrical
wires corroded and broke. Five of the six new gyros were modified
to prevent a recurrence. The space agency says it ran out of time
to produce the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and Grunsfeld also struggled with a second task, freeing a
pair of small valves to release nitrogen gas from a failed cooling
system for the telescope's infrared camera. Engineers want nitrogen
frozen in the cooling lines to vent away before a replacement
refrigerator is installed during a shuttle visit in mid-2001.
</P>
<P>
   Alloted 15 minutes, the task took more than 90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and Grunsfeld regained their stride with the installation
of small voltage regulators on each of the Hubble's six power
storage batteries.
</P>
<P>
   The devices are designed to keep the near 10-year-old batteries
from overheating as they are re-charged with power generated by the
telescope's solar arrays. The electricity is consumed by the
telescope's science instruments and electronic gear.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, astronauts Mike Foale and Claude Nicollier will
embark on the mission's second spacewalk. They plan to install a
new flight computer and fine guidance sensor, a large optical
instrument that is crucial to pointing accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   The new computer will replace a custom-made model developed in
the late 1970s but augmented with a faster co-processor by visiting
shuttle astronauts six years ago. The new device has 20 times the
processing speed with six times as much memory as its predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   The computer swap is considered one of the mission's most
challenging tasks because of the number of small fasteners and
connectors that must be removed and re-installed. Among them are
seven data cables, each with a connector housing 100 small gold
pins that cannot be bent as they are mated.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I add up the number of pins, it scares me,'' Foale said
during a pre-mission interview. ``They are all very fragile.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's second major task is Nicollier's installation of a
fine guidance sensor, an optical instrument shaped like a baby
grand piano with a mass of 500 pounds. Hubble is equipped with
three of the devices.
</P>
<P>
   With a successful conclusion to the second spacewalk, NASA would
consider Discovery's repair mission to the space telescope a full
success.
</P>
<P>
   During a third spacewalk, however, the astronauts plan to
install a new data recorder and transmitter as well as to patch
damage to the exterior of the telescope caused by its exposure to
solar radiation.

EDITORIAL: STRENGTHENING CASTRO'S HAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Dec. 23:
</P>
<P>
   Forty-one years after he came to power and a decade after the
end of the Cold War, Fidel Castro maintains his repressive rule
over Cuba, in part with the unwitting collusion of the United
States. The resolution this week of a hostage standoff with Cuban
detainees in a Louisiana jail and the unresolved custody battle
over 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez in Florida are examples of how an
outdated U.S. attempt to isolate Cuba and weaken Castro's regime
accomplishes just the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   Both of these events are symptoms of an obsolete and
increasingly counterproductive U.S. estrangement from Cuba. In
Louisiana, U.S. officials ended the six-day standoff by striking a
deal with the Cuban government that permitted six of seven Cuban
inmates at the center of the uprising to be deported back to Cuba.
The inmates had come here in the 1980 Mariel boatlift, during which
Castro sent thousands of criminals to the United States. The
inmates had completed prison sentences for crimes committed in the
United States but were being held indefinitely because their
deportation had been blocked by Castro.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement by which Castro dropped his opposition would
appear to be a laudable example of all-too-infrequent cooperation
between the two countries. But it should not have been necessary.
Because the United States lacks normal diplomatic relations with
Cuba, some 2,400 Cuban inmates are languishing in local jails
across America under similarly combustible circumstances. Instead
of deporting them routinely, the United States has to rely on
Castro's political calculation that he can play the statesman,
thereby enhancing his stature at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the unseemly custody battle over Elian Gonzalez was
partly a symptom of the embargo and related laws. The boy was
rescued off the Florida coast Nov. 25 after surviving a boat
capsizing that claimed the lives of his mother and stepfather. The
U.S. ban on all exports to Cuba, including food and medicine, fuels
the very hardships that drive Cubans to flee the island. The Cuban
Adjustment Act of 1966, in turn, which enables Cubans to circumvent
immigration requirements that apply to all other nationals, has
become a strong incentive for the kind of smuggling enterprise
using overloaded powerboats that nearly cost Elian his life.
</P>
<P>
   The act also made it possible for the boy to be immediately
turned over to relatives in Miami, who have allowed him to be
cynically exploited by exiles bent on discrediting Castro. Now we
are confronted with the spectacle of Castro, whose police state has
ruined countless families, demanding that Elian be returned to his
father and grandparents. The case must be resolved in a manner that
best serves the boy's needs, not those of Castro or his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   With his Soviet benefactors long gone and his state-controlled
economy on its knees, Castro has little left with which to mobilize
popular support beyond his stature as defender of the homeland
against U.S. economic aggression. The Clinton administration has
moved in the last year toward a slight thawing on the margins,
allowing cultural exchanges and increasing travel opportunities,
for example. But on the larger issues of trade and diplomacy it
remains trapped in a futile policy from the Cold War past.

DOCTORS COMPLAIN ABOUT PROMISE BY H.M.O.
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATT: Minn., N.Y., N.J., Md.)   (rk) 
 By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   UnitedHealth Group, the big managed-care company, was widely
praised last month after it said it was eliminating tight controls
over decisions by physicians, which the doctors derided as
``second-guessing.'' United said that doctors would no longer need
advance authorization for most treatments and that the company
would not refuse payment afterward.
</P>
<P>
   But doctors in the UnitedHealthcare network said Wednesday that
guidelines they had just received were still highly restrictive.
They said United was still requiring prior approval, called
``pre-certification,'' for expensive computerized imaging tests,
physical rehabilitation and prescription drugs as well as mental
health and drug and alcohol treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Silverstein, a marketing vice president of United, based in
Minnetonka, Minn., said the authorization requirements would end as
subcontracts are revised with companies that supervise the
arrangements. He said most prior approvals would be eliminated by
Jan. 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Even without the approvals, United will still require advance
notification for many such procedures. But Dr. Craig Keyes, chief
medical officer of the United units in New York and New Jersey,
said that even the notifications might be dropped if, for example,
``over the next two or three months we find it is not helpful to
call someone before doing a CT scan.''
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors were skeptical about the new policies. ``They made
everybody think that they didn't have to get all this
pre-certification, and it's not true,'' said Dr. Patricia Klein, a
neurologist in Westwood, N.J. Dr. Klein, who heads a legislative
policy group of the New Jersey Medical Society, said she was
considering leaving the United Healthcare network.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a subcontractor, you control the subcontractor,''
said Dr. Ted Lewers, board chairman of the American Medical
Association, which praised United's announcement last month. He
said the company might have to buy out some subcontracts but ``if
they are going to give their word, they should stand by the word.
It appears they are not doing so,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to specialist physicians in the New York and New
Jersey area, the company also said this month that it had hired
Magellan Specialty Health, a company in Columbia, Md., that reviews
charges by physicians. It said Magellan would ``provide support''
in carrying out its new programs.
</P>
<P>
   Magellan said, in an undated letter that some specialists
received on Dec. 10, that these doctors would have to supply
medical records to justify higher-level payments for difficult
cases. Without the paperwork, payments would be lower, it said.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors in the area have dealt with the company before. The New
Jersey Medical Society said Magellan ``had presented great
difficulties to New Jersey physicians in the past and has been
dropped by other HMOs in the state.'' Dr. Klein said that Magellan
had routinely lowered her payments when it worked for another
insurance company, NYLcare.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes said he was aware of the complaints. He said Magellan had
controlled the payments of claims for NYLcare. Under its contract
with United, Magellan will be limited to an advisory role; United
will make its own decisions about payments, he said. &QL;

ROBINSON IS A TRAIL BLAZER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH MARTIN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hikers look forward to the new and unanticipated
beyond the next bend. For John W. Robinson, that has included a
writing trail that started with youthful jaunts and matured with a
role as unofficial interpreter of Southern California's mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, 70, of Fullerton has written 12 books, a few of them
local classics, including ``Trails of the Angeles,'' now in its
18th printing with 80,000 sold, and a history of its rugged high
country called ``San Gabriels.'' Other histories revolve around the
San Jacinto and San Bernardino mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people who don't know about these
mountains,'' Robinson said, describing the San Gabriels, in
particular, as overused yet underappreciated. ``Many people don't
know the treasure they have.''
</P>
<P>
   To those who do, it is Wilderness Press' ``Trails of the
Angeles: 100 Hikes in the San Gabriels'' that peak-baggers consider
their bible; they all but hold its author up on a pedestal.
</P>
<P>
   It all began ordinarily enough for the man who would be king of
the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   As a youth, he hiked in the Sierra Nevada mountain range, went
on YMCA treks and attended summer camp. His first local trip was to
the top of San Gabriel Peak; adult guides ``told kids there were
watermelons on top,'' he said. Yeah, right, like there are
strawberries atop Strawberry Peak.
</P>
<P>
   He graduated from USC in 1951 with a major in social studies and
a minor in history, long before the other John Robinson had any
association with the university. Following a two-year stint in the
Army he began what would become a 33-year teaching career. He
started a routine that lasted until his retirement in 1988:
teaching during the week, hiking once a weekend.
</P>
<P>
   A few of the sojourns spurred Robinson's early interest in
history. Walking among the Mount Lowe ruins _ a railway to its
zenith past broken- down resorts and near-abandoned mines piqued
his curiosity. Soon he was devoting one day a weekend to research
and the other to hiking.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson first intended to write a book only about Mount Lowe,
but his interest expanded. The result _ his third book after a
couple of what he termed minor efforts _ was ``Trails of the
Angeles,'' a mix of generous portions of the past and detailed
trail descriptions. The winning combination is endearing to
wafflestompers.
</P>
<P>
   Hikers scrambling through boulders on the 6-mile Mount Hillyer
Trail near Chilao learn it was a hideout of late 19th century
bandit Tiburcio Vasquez (who also took to holing up in an area
farther to the west that would later be known as Vasquez Rocks).
The 230-page ``Trails of the Angeles'' also reveals to those on a
couple of trails from Vincent Gap that Charles Tom Vincent was a
fugitive who discovered a gold lode in 1894.
</P>
<P>
   Although Robinson is most associated with the San Gabriels, he
has hiked many of the prime backcountry in North America.
Regionally, the San Jacintos west of Palm Springs are his favorite
mountains. He backpacks in the Sierra every summer and has visited
Alaska a half-dozen times. Among the high points of his hiking
experience was seeing five grizzly bears in Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting Alaska, he said, allows ``a feeling of true primeval
wilderness. It's a feeling you don't get in the Lower 48, like
you've gone back 1,000 years in time.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's latest book project, tentatively titled ``Gateways to
Southern California,'' is a history of the travel routes into the
state's lower end horse trails, wagon roads and early highways.
Like many of his projects, it started as something else _ a history
of mountain passes _ and has kept evolving.
</P>
<P>
   And like all his books, this one involves extended periods in
the library. He has spent hundreds of hours reading Southern
California papers printed from 1851 to 1890. But he enjoys research
and meeting people, especially old-timers with choice stories and
anecdotes.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's travels have taken him to trails both well-trod and
not taken, but their point of departure is familiar: a love of the
outdoors and a natural curiosity about the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just feel good being in the mountains,'' he said. ``Even
though you're exhausted, you're spiritually refreshed. I need this
experience to keep me a whole person.''
</P>
<P>
   That zeal is duplicated in the completeness of his writing. For
example, ``Trails of the Angeles'' functions as a trailhead for
``San Gabriels,'' which, with his titles chronicling the San
Bernardinos and San Jacintos, is part of his trilogy of ``urban
mountain ranges.''
</P>
<P>
   ``San Gabriels'' shows that the need for watershed protection
was a major impetus to the development of Angeles National Forest
as a protected area. Robinson follows each slow step in the
building of Angeles Crest Highway from 1929 to 1957, starting with
pressure from the automobile and gas lobbies and a series of
disastrous blazes in the 1920s that kept burning because they could
not be reached by firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   He considers the trilogy most important among his books because
of the importance of explaining the wilderness experience and the
need for preservation.

   Bridge to Nowhere hike &QL; 
is a winter wonderland &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
By Rich Martin
</P>
<P>
   John W. Robinson had a hard time listing his favorite hikes of
the San Gabriel Mountains, and rated the top one in part for
seasonal reasons: It's a good trip during the winter, when snow and
cold weather can make the higher mountains impassable.
</P>
<P>
   His choice: The so-called Bridge to Nowhere hike, reached by
taking the Foothill Freeway (210) east and traveling north on
Highway 39 in Azusa. Turn right on San Gabriel Canyon Road and
drive 8 miles to the ranger station.
</P>
<P>
   The 9-mile hike crosses and recrosses the East Fork of the San
Gabriel River to a site known as the Narrows.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a little bit of variety,'' he said, with the deepest,
``most spectacular gorge in Southern California.'' All is contained
in a stunning forest in the shadow of an 8,000-foot peak.
</P>
<P>
   The route ends in an oddity _ a bridge that survived a 1938
flood. Most of a long-ago highway was washed out by the deluge and
not rebuilt, leaving the bridge span as an eerie testimonial to
nature's wrath.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Can't fail trails &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Other hikes in the Angeles National Forest particularly revered by
John W. Robinson:
</P>
<P>
   _Crystal Lake (reached by taking Highway 39 north) to Windy Gap,
and from there to Mount Islip.
</P>
<P>
   _Dawson Saddle, highest point along Angeles Crest Highway east
of Mount Williamson, to Throop Peak or Mount Baden-Powell.
</P>
<P>
   _Mount Waterman from Buckhorn.
</P>
<P>
   _Icehouse Canyon in the Mount Baldy area, which affords ``all
kinds of options,'' including loop trails and peak-bagging.
</P>
<P>
   Others he enjoys are San Gabriel Peak (near Red Box), Mount
Hillyer in the Chilao area and the so-called Bridge to Nowhere,
reached by taking Highway 39 north.

BRAVES' ROCKER BLASTS NEW YORK, DRAWING IRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The latest anti-New York remarks by Atlanta Braves
reliever John Rocker have managed to unite such disparate types as
Mets fans and Braves fans, and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and first
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani and Mrs. Clinton, the potential Senate election
opponents, each said Wednesday that baseball should punish Rocker
for comments published in the latest issue of Sports Illustrated.
</P>
<P>
   In the three-page article, Rocker makes offensive remarks about
different groups, including homosexuals, AIDS patients, single
mothers, African-Americans, Japanese, Koreans, Vietnamese, Indians,
Russians and anyone who speaks Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   In the article, Rocker talked about the subway to Shea Stadium:
``Imagine having to take the 7 train,'' riding through ``Beirut
next to some kid with purple hair, next to some queer with AIDS,
right next to some dude who got out of jail for the fourth time,
right next to some 20-year-old mom with four kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker admitted Wednesday that he went ``way too far.''
</P>
<P>
   In his statement Wednesday, Rocker said: ``While I have
evidenced strong competitive feelings about New York fans in the
past, and take responsibility for things I have said publicly,
including the Sports Illustrated article, I recognize that I have
gone way too far in my competitive zeal. Even though it might
appear otherwise from what I've said, I am not a racist.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves were not amused. Braves general manager John
Schulerholz said in statement that Rocker's viewpoints ``in no way
represent those of the Atlanta Braves organization.'' He spoke with
Rocker for 10 minutes Wednesday and said he planned to meet with
him later ``to discuss what actions the organization will take.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball commissioner Bud Selig called Rocker's remarks
``inappropriate and offensive'' and said they are being reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Braves outfielder Brian Jordan told Atlanta's WQXI-AM, ``You
can't respect a guy that makes comments like that publicly.'' Fans
in Atlanta echoed that sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   At his daily news conference in Manhattan, Giuliani pointed out
that his Yankees had beaten Rocker's Braves in the World Series.
Then he implied that Rocker's attitude underscored why the Braves
won only one World Series in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Braves have some great players who are immigrants and
foreigners, so maybe that kind of tension created on a team is the
reason why the team underperformed in the World Series throughout
the decade,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton said in her statement: ``These bigoted remarks were
outrageous and unacceptable and send a terrible message to kids.
New Yorkers are proud of the city's diversity.''  &QL;

REFS TO BE SEEN, HEARD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The NBA's latest fan-friendly innovation _
microphoned referees _ makes its debut Saturday, when the Lakers
play host to the San Antonio Spurs on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   To Lakers coach Phil Jackson, the NBA's ``fan''-tastic marketing
ploy is anything but fantastic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ridiculous,'' he said, ``but that's part of the
showmanship that the commissioner has done with this league, and
it's been successful, because he's been open. And I don't know if
they're pushing the envelope on this one or not, but I can tell you
an occasion when a referee was miked, and I thought he cost us a
ballgame in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the 1992 Finals against the Portland Trail Blazers, and
referee Jess Kersey was wearing a microphone for an NBA
Entertainment video (not the TV audience), and as Jackson recalls,
Michael Jordan used a profanity while complaining to Kersey about a
call.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Jess felt he had to call a technical (foul) on him,''
Jackson said, ``and really it was an embarrassing situation for him
and for Michael. It wasn't a big protest, but it balanced out the
scale on some level they got a basket, a technical, suddenly it's a
six-point game with three minutes to go and changed the nature of
the ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I complained after that about miking referees and I'm
surprised that they would consider it,'' he said. ``I think it
takes away from the judgmental nature, because...instead of being
able to do your job consciously, without thought, you have to be
self-conscious, and that's going to screw things up.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch report: Travis Knight, on the injured list since Dec.10
because of a right-ankle sprain, might be activated in time for
Saturday's game. Considering the Spurs' twin-tower lineup of
7-footers Tim Duncan and David Robinson, the Lakers are likely to
need every available big body.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thought is there, and we will consider (activating
Knight),'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal has gotten into foul trouble in the past
dueling Duncan and Robinson, and the Lakers' only active backup
center is 6-11 John Salley. The 7-foot Knight has played sparingly
this season. He's made just 15 appearances, averaging 5.1 minutes,
1.6 rebounds and 0.7 points.
</P>
<P>
   All-Stars: O'Neal is the top vote-getter among all Western
Conference players in the first All-Star fan balloting returns.
O'Neal has 275,487 votes, and a huge lead over the Spurs' Robinson
(98,944) among West centers.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant is currently third among Western Conference guards,
with 142,328 votes. He trails Seattle's Gary Payton (146,360) and
Phoenix's Jason Kidd (165,727).
</P>
<P>
   Glen Rice is seventh among forwards, with 43,926 votes.

TWO REACTORS BEING SOLD TO UTILITY COULD PROVIDE CHEAPER
ELECTRICITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La.)  (rk) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A utility in upstate New York said Wednesday it was
buying the controlling share of two nuclear reactors, including the
state's biggest, most expensive reactor, at a small fraction of
what they cost to build, and would turn the reactors over to an
outside group to operate.
</P>
<P>
   The utility, Rochester Gas and Electric, said the deal would
make nuclear power cheap enough to benefit consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Entergy, the New Orleans-based company that would operate the
two plants, Nine Mile Point 1 and 2, already owns and operates six
reactors in the South. It said it would also like to run three more
of the six reactors in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   Rochester Gas and Electric said that Entergy would take over
much of the financial risk of operating the plants. The utility is
paying about $210 million for the controlling interest it is
buying.
</P>
<P>
   Entergy is already negotiating to buy two more New York nuclear
reactors, FitzPatrick and Indian Point 3, both owned by the New
York Power Authority, and Wednesday expressed interest in a fifth,
Indian Point 2, which Consolidated Edison said last week it was
considering putting on the block.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a first-of-a-kind agreement,'' said Thomas S.
Richards, president and chief executive of Rochester Gas and
Electric's parent company, RGS Energy. ``It benefits customers,
benefits the company and benefits upstate New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, operating and maintenance costs will be covered
by Entergy, which will earn revenue only by selling power; thus if
the plants do not run, the cost falls on the shareholders of
Entergy, not the utility's customers.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction announced Wednesday represents another step
toward consolidation in the business of running nuclear plants that
some experts predict will eventually swallow all but a handful of
the nation's 103 operating reactors, leaving them in the hands of a
tiny number of operating companies. It also confirms that the
market value of such reactors, a number calculated by profit-making
companies based on their expectations of how much electricity the
plants can make and what they will cost to run, is an extremely
small fraction of what they cost to build.
</P>
<P>
   A vice president of Entergy, Michael Kansler, said at a news
conference in Rochester that his company intended to make its
profit by improving the plants' reliability and keeping them in
service about 90 percent of the time, rather than the current
average, in the low 80s.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators may be skeptical. At the New York Public Service
Commission, David C. Flanagan, a spokesman, said that the
commission had been trying to have utilities sell their generating
assets, to enhance competition. ``Rochester Gas and Electric will
bear a significant burden in terms of proving that this proposal is
consistent with the commission's competitive agenda, and in the
overall public interest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The plants will come from the sellers with what amounts to a
decommissioning dowry of about $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risk of operating and decommissioning the plant is
substantially reduced,'' said Richards. ``We now pay for power
only. If Entergy produces power, we pay for it. If they don't, we
don't.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal will not raise anyone's electric rates, executives of
Rochester Gas &AMP; Electric and Entergy promised Wednesday.

TOYS `R' US FALLS BEHIND ON SHIPPING
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What could possibly be worse than venturing into a toy store two
days before Christmas?
</P>
<P>
   Having to go to the toy store when you thought you had your toy
shopping done a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   Toys R Us said Wednesday that its Internet site will not be able
to fulfill all of the orders it had promised to ship by Christmas.
And to make good, it sent those customers left in the lurch free
$100 gift certificates that it says will arrive by overnight
courier Thursday morning. That gives parents two days to take those
gift certificates into local Toys R Us stores to try to buy a gift.
Or they can simply give the certificates to their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sat down yesterday and felt that there were some orders
that we were not able to ship for Christmas,'' John Barbour, the
chief executive of Toysrus.com said Wednesday.
   ``Rather than take the risk of disappointing people, we wanted
to make sure people had time to make other arrangements.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbour said that fewer than 5 percent of the company's holiday
orders are affected, but he declined to be more specific or to say
the total cost of the gift certificates.
</P>
<P>
   Since the average order is about $60, Barbour said, most
customers will be able to buy more or bigger gifts than they had
planned on.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, we're trying to appease people for letting them
down,'' he said. Customers will have the option of canceling their
order from the online service or waiting for shipment after
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Customers said the move is hardly enough, especially because
many of the most popular toys are sold out in stores by now.
</P>
<P>
   ``This does nothing to appease a child on Christmas morning when
he doesn't find his present,'' said Kevin Davitt, who is still
waiting for an order from Toysrus.com. ``A 6-year-old doesn't want
a gift certificate, he wants his Nintendo or his Pokemon.''
</P>
<P>
   Davitt, a publicist from Glen Rock, N.J., ordered two video
games for his 6-year-old son on Dec. 13, agreeing to pay $19.90 for
express shipping. Toysrus said the shipment would arrive in five
days.
</P>
<P>
   Toys R Us was a small player on the Internet until the middle of
November when it mailed out 62 million catalogs offering free
shipping for orders from its Web site. Since then its Web site has
been so busy that many customers couldn't even get in, and those
that did place orders found that items often arrived weeks after
they were promised, if at all.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it could not promise Christmas delivery for
customers who ordered with regular shipment after Dec. 10 and with
express shipment after Dec. 15.
</P>
<P>
   This hardly dented traffic to the company's Internet site. Last
week, Toysrus.com was the fifth most visited online store, with 1.6
million visitors, according to Media Metrix, a New York research
firm.
</P>
<P>
   Barbour said that the problem is largely in the company's
warehouse, which has not been able to pack and ship the orders,
even though the toys are sitting on its shelves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's taken us longer to get through the complex process of
fulfilling orders than anyone expected,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other online companies have also run into problems fulfilling
all their orders. EToys, for example, says there is a ``small
percentage'' of purchases that it won't be able to ship by
Christmas. Unlike Toysrus, the problem at eToys is that its Web
site continued to sell some hot items, like Pokemon toys, even
after its warehouse ran out of stock. The company has sent e-mail
to these customers, an eToys spokesman said, in recent days,
suggesting alternate items. While eToys has given away some gift
certificates, they have generally not been amounts as large as
$100.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many customers say their biggest frustration with
Toysrus has been that the company wasn't able to accurately predict
its shipping time.
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest beef in retrospect was the total absence of any
customer service,'' said Joseph C. Petillo, an attorney in East
Windsor, N.J. He just received an order placed with Toysrus at the
end of November, just in time for his son's birthday on Thursday.
``I wouldn't have felt so bad if they had given me the opportunity
to cancel and shop elsewhere.''

WEIS MARKETS TO CONSIDER A SALE, PLEASING DISSIDENT SHAREHOLDERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The two groups of cousins who jointly control Weis Markets
agreed Wednesday to explore all options for enhancing shareholder
value, including selling the 164-store chain of supermarkets,
ending the threat of a proxy fight by one faction.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement could be a first step toward determining a price
at which the cousins who run Weis could buy out the shares owned by
their cousins or, perhaps, to a sale of the 92-year-old company.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Weis, which have risen about 18 percent in recent
weeks, closed Wednesday at $41.4375, off 50 cents. With the recent
run-up, shares now trade at about the same level as 12 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   For some time a group including Janet Weis, the 80-year-old
widow of Sigfried Weis, the company's former chairman, and the
families of their three daughters, have wanted to sell the chain
and cash out their 41 percent interest; at the current share price,
that stake is worth about $700 million. They formed a committee and
were threatening a proxy fight to add two more seats to the
company's seven-member board, but they agreed Wednesday to drop
those efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Robert F. Weis, the current chairman whose family also owns 41
percent of the company, said after the stock market closed: ``We
have initiated a process that will allow the full board of Weis
Markets to determine what is in our collective best interest with
full information concerning our financial and strategic
alternatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Weis reiterated that the company was not for sale. ``However, in
an effort to avoid the continuing disruption to our company of a
proxy contest and the inevitable attendant litigation,'' he said,
``we have agreed to include this alternative and a recapitalization
within the range of options that we have asked Morgan Stanley to
explore.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Weis and another dissident shareholder, Sidney Apfelbaum,
issued a statement saying that ``we are pleased that we can proceed
forward on a consensual basis.''
</P>
<P>
   The statements suggested that the company's investment banker,
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, would fully share information with the
dissidents' adviser, Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Weis Markets, which is based in Sunbury, Pa., has long been an
exceptionally profitable chain, at one time earning a third as much
in profits as the giant Safeway chain on sales volume only 5
percent as large, according to Forbes magazine. But Walmart Stores'
the recent drive into Weis territory has raised questions about the
chain's future.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for both sides declined further comment Wednesday
night.

EDITORIAL: WRONG CALL ON BELL ATLANTIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Dec. 23:
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission's approval of Bell
Atlantic's application to enter the market for long-distance
service in New York state looks more like a bow to political
pressure than to consumer protection. The 1996 Telecommunications
Act requires that for Bell Atlantic to gain permission to go after
the long-distance customers of AT&AMP;T and other competitors, it must
first open up its own network of wires and switches so that these
competitors get a fair shot at wooing Bell Atlantic's customers for
local service. Bell Atlantic comes close, but does not pass some
key tests.
</P>
<P>
   The commission could have held up approval for a couple of
months until Bell Atlantic showed it was fully ready. But having
already turned aside several previous applications from Bell
companies, it responded to pressure to prove the '96 act was
creating competition by finally approving one. The danger with
compromised standards is that Bell Atlantic could wield its power
to wall off its local market even as it moves to crush competitors
in long-distance and Internet services.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic owns the only telephone wire into most homes and
businesses. The '96 act requires that Bells rent their wires,
switches and other equipment to AT&AMP;T and other potential
competitors so that they can reach local customers, offering them
an attractive combination of local, long-distance, Internet and
wireless services. Then the act invites Bell to offer the same
services so that customers would get a battle for their business.
The commission's job is to ensure that Bell Atlantic does not use
its chokehold over its network to create problems for customers who
ask to switch to AT&AMP;T, MCI Worldcom or others.
</P>
<P>
   Under the heavy thumb of the New York Public Service Commission,
Bell Atlantic has taken tremendous strides over the past 18 months
or so to comply with the '96 act. The state authority even had an
independent company, KPMG Peat Marwick, create a fictitious
telephone company, placing orders to see if Bell Atlantic met its
demands for equipment rental. The state authority also kept track
of actual orders placed by MCI and others.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic made an excessive number of mistakes, even putting
a few customer phones out of order when it switched their wires. It
also fumbled too often when providing equipment for high-speed
Internet access and renting its entire network of switches and
wires to competitors. Despite these shortfalls _ each correctible
within a couple of months if not weeks _ the state authority
recommended to the FCC that it approve Bell Atlantic's application.
The Department of Justice, scrutinizing the state's data,
disagreed. Wednesday the commission waved Justice's objections
aside and settled for what Bell Atlantic had already achieved,
threatening stiff penalties if its performance deteriorates after
it gains entrance into long distance.
</P>
<P>
   Having acted prematurely, the commission faces two challenges.
The first is to carry out the threat to hammer Bell Atlantic with
fines if its actions prevent competitors from serving their
customers as well as Bell Atlantic serves its own. The second is to
make sure that every other application by a Bell company to enter
long distance is held to no lower standard than has been set for
Bell Atlantic in New York. If it does both, the commission might
still create the strong competition that Congress promised and
consumers expect.

ISRAEL TO IMPORT NATURAL GAS FROM EGYPT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Egypt will provide natural gas to Israel through a
long-delayed ``peace pipeline'' across the Sinai Desert, the prime
minister's office said Wednesday night, announcing a deal that will
radically change Israel's energy policy and its economic
relationship with its most powerful neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Gas should be flowing to Israel within two years, a spokesman
for Prime Minister Ehud Barak said, though pricing and other
details must still be negotiated by the Israeli and Egyptian
companies directly handling the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   For Israel, which has never relied on a Middle Eastern energy
supplier, the Egyptian gas deal represents a profound strategic and
psychological shift.
</P>
<P>
   And for Egypt, a pipeline from the Nile Delta to Israel's
Mediterranean coast represents a significant thawing of what has
been termed the ``cold peace'' with its Jewish neighbor. Two
decades after the signing of their landmark Camp David peace pact,
Egypt and Israel have maintained a frigid diplomatic distance, and
only minimal economic ties.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt's approval of the gas deal is clearly intended as a reward
for what it sees as Barak's serious peacemaking efforts in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   By some industry estimates, gas exports to Israel through the
new pipeline could reach 4 billion cubic meters yearly, a deal
worth billions over the pipeline's lifetime. The deal would foster
unprecedented interdependence: Egypt would become Israel's most
important energy supplier, and Israel would become a major source
of Egyptian export earnings.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The announcement Wednesday also constitutes a business triumph
for the Italian-Egyptian consortium that began building the
pipeline last year, when a bilateral sales pact appeared far from
certain. Officially, the 150-mile pipeline was destined only for El
Arish, a Sinai beach town 30 miles from Israel. A spur line from El
Arish to a small new power plant in the Gaza Strip was discussed
with the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   But ENI-Agip, the Italian oil and gas company financing the
pipeline, had acknowledged that its real goal was to supply gas to
Israel _ and, later, via undersea pipeline up the eastern
Mediterranean shore, to Lebanon, Syria, and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Out-pumping Shell, British Gas, and BP-Amoco, ENI-Agip has
become the largest foreign developer of Egypt's gas fields, which
produce 2.3 billion cubic feet a day. Its Sinai pipeline venture is
a partnership with the state-owned Egyptian General Petroleum Corp.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Israel has always been wholly dependent on imported fuel, buying
oil from Norway, Mexico and other distant non-OPEC suppliers, and
shipping in coal for power plants from Colombia, South Africa and
Australia. For most of its independent life, Israel was prevented
by boycotts from buying oil or gas from its Arab neighbors. But
even as Egypt and some Persian Gulf exporters tentatively expressed
a willingness to sell, some Israeli political leaders and military
strategists argued that Israel should continue to rely only on
suppliers far removed from the enmities of the Middle East.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   State power company officials in Israel had long favored
importing Egyptian gas, a cheaper and cleaner alternative to their
present imports. A national energy plan stated that Israel should
aim to produce a quarter of its electricity with natural gas by
2005. But diplomatic friction intervened. Breaking the impasse,
Barak discussed the project ``extensively'' with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak earlier this year, expressing Israel's desire to
purchase the gas, the prime minister's office said Wednesday
evening.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday morning, in a meeting in the parliament building here,
the Egyptian ambassador to Israel notified Barak that his
government had formally approved the sale of gas to Israel. Barak's
response _ that Israel is equally willing to buy _ was certain to
be welcomed by industrialists and environmentalists but criticized
by the right-wing opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak had refused to authorize gas sales to the previous
Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu. Angering Netanyahu, the
Egyptian leader openly linked the gas deal to progress in peace
talks with the Palestinians. In response, the Netanyahu government
suggested that such political considerations could make Egypt an
unreliable long-term supplier, even if Egypt were willing to
proceed with the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Ariel Sharon, now the leader of the right-wing opposition, led
resistance in the last government to Egyptian natural gas imports.
He vigorously argued in favor of costly but in his view safer
alternatives, such as liquefied natural gas terminals and undersea
pipelines from Turkey or Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Despite opposition skepticism, the gas import deal could be a
prelude to further energy cooperation with Egypt, analysts believe.
Jordan and Egypt recently connected their electricity networks with
a cable under the Red Sea. Israel and the Palestinian Authority are
now expected to discuss linking their interconnected power grids
with the two neighboring countries.

EDITORIAL: 'TIS THE SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Dec. 22:
</P>
<P>
   What is it about this Christmas that is driving New York's
political leaders into a frenzy of vilification? The answer is that
two strong candidates for Senate are preparing for a titanic
struggle with a level of bitterness already at full boil. On
Wednesday Mayor Rudolph Giuliani asserted that the Democrats were
conspiring to get him, while Hillary Rodham Clinton declared that
the mayor lacked the temperament to serve in the Senate.
Specifically, Giuliani sees politics in a decision by Andrew Cuomo,
secretary of housing and urban development, to seize control of a
federally funded homelessness program, as well as in a separate
grand jury investigation into City Hall's handling of building
inspections.
</P>
<P>
   As housing secretary, Cuomo has the right to ensure that federal
money is spent properly. But seizing control of a $60 million
program was an abrupt and extreme step. Since the secretary is a
booster of Mrs. Clinton's candidacy, the mayor was also within his
rights to see politics behind Cuomo's action. The mayor, on the
other hand, has little justification in criticizing the
investigation by the federal and local prosecutors in Brooklyn into
whether his former chief of staff, Bruce Teitelbaum, tried to help
politically connected developers in their disputes with the city's
Buildings Department.
</P>
<P>
   Under Giuliani, New York City has kept up a multifaceted
approach on homelessness, emphasizing mental health and drug
rehabilitation services as well as shelter. Lately, however, the
mayor has stirred a furor with a series of excessively harsh policy
initiatives, some of which are being challenged in court. At issue
in the dispute with Cuomo, however, is not the move to arrest
homeless people or force them out of shelters and possibly remove
their children if they refuse to work. Rather it is a federal court
ruling in November that the city had improperly withheld funds from
a group called Housing Works in retaliation for its rallies
attacking Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo says the court decision forced him to act to protect the
integrity of federal funding for homeless services. But the court
ruling dealt with only a small part of the $60 million, and City
Hall has said that it is prepared to finance Housing Works if its
appeals in court are rejected. It would have been better if Cuomo
had allowed the legal process to work. But now that he has acted,
he must follow through on his pledge to put the decision on
distributing federal money into the hands of a nonpolitical entity
in the city.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Brooklyn inquiry, it ill behooves Giuliani, a former
federal prosecutor, to charge politics in an effort to investigate
a matter that came to light when a building collapsed in Brooklyn
last month, killing one person. According to reports in The New
York Times, a former building commissioner has told prosecutors
that Teitelbaum, the mayor's former chief of staff and now the
director of his Senate campaign, pressured him to remove an
inspector who had had run-ins with politically connected developers
in Williamsburg. Such an allegation is serious and must be cleared
up by a pursuit of the facts. By attacking the prosecutors in this
fashion, Giuliani is imitating President and Mrs. Clinton's least
attractive political tactic.

GORE, IN IOWA, JABS AT BRADLEY OVER FARM PROBLEMS AND PRESCHOOL
FUNDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Updates with Gore's comments from farm forum, Bradley calling
Gore's preschool proposal a voucher program.) 
 (nk) 
 By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMES, Iowa _ Vice President Al Gore campaigned through central
Iowa on Wednesday and sparred at long distance with former Sen.
Bill Bradley over farm problems and pre-school education.
</P>
<P>
   Before speaking here at a forum sponsored by the Iowa Farmers
Union, Gore used half a dozen radio and television interviews to
complain that Bradley had declined to debate him over farm issues
here Wednesday or next month in Cedar Rapids. ``Senator Bradley has
refused to have a specific debate on farm policy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's spokesman, Eric Hauser, responded from West Orange,
N.J., that there were other forums where the two would appear
together. ``We'll be talking about agriculture a lot with Al Gore
in Iowa, and we look forward to it,'' Hauser said.
</P>
<P>
   Then Bradley, the former three-term senator from New Jersey,
said through his campaign staff: ``For seven years, the
Clinton/Gore administration has presided over a farm crisis of
historic proportions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've needed strong leadership for fundamental changes in our
farm programs, and the administration has not provided it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Farmers Union forum, the vice president renewed his
criticism of Bradley's absence and promised that in a Gore
administration, farm policy would be ``explicitly directed at
saving the viability of family farms.'' Among other things, he
vowed that the Packers and Stockyards Act would be enforced to
prevent price discrimination by packers against small farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Much of his criticism was directed at the Freedom to Farm Act of
1996, passed by a Republican-controlled Congress but signed into
law by President Clinton. The vice president said it had an
inadequate safety net to protect farmers when prices slumped.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the only presidential candidate who has not stopped
stumping for Christmas, began his campaign day Wednesday at 6 a.m.
at a Des Moines school by appearing at a ``town meeting''
sponsored, and briefly broadcast, by ABC's ``Good Morning
America.'' There he sketched a 10-year, $50 billion proposal for a
``universal preschool initiative that will make high quality
preschool available to every 3 year old in America and expand
coverage to 3-year olds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most learning takes place in the first few years of life,'' he
said, ``and if kids get off to a great start before they ever get
to kindergarten, the chances for them to succeed in life, to have
good jobs, to lead fulfilling lives, is greatly enhanced.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the Gore proposal, federal matching grants to states would
allow 4-year-olds greater access to preschool. With some parents
sure not to take advantage of the opportunity, he said, the
leftover funds could be used for programs for 3-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley campaign promptly criticized the proposal as
delivering less than it promised. Based on a Gore campaign estimate
that 75 percent of 4-year-olds would be enrolled, it noted that 64
percent now were in preschool. ``Al Gore,'' the Bradley campaign
said, ``would spend $50 billion to enroll an additional 11 percent
of the nation's 4-year-olds in preschool.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley campaign also described the approach envisioned by
Gore as a voucher program, since it would allow parents to use
public money to place their children in private-school programs.
Bradley aides suggested that the vice president was being
hypocritical, because he has criticized Bradley for having
supported an experimental school voucher program when he was a
senator.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's campaign said that what he proposed was different
from a voucher system, because it would give money not to
individual families but to the states, which would run the program.
</P>
<P>
   The sniping proceeded. Gore spokesman Chris Lehane issued a
statement saying Bradley was launching ``misleading attacks on
Gore's bold plan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Since Bradley has failed to offer a comprehensive education
plan and is running from his 18-year-record of supporting private
school vouchers and tax credits,'' the statement said, ``all his
campaign can do is divert and attack.''
</P>
<P>
   In a more general campaign appearance at a breakfast meeting
with Jewish supporters in Des Moines, Gore stressed his experience,
saying he knew how to ``keep the economy going,'' and said he had
maintained a 100 percent pro-Israel voting record in the House,
``compiled on the basis of inner instinct,'' despite having almost
no Jewish constituents to lobby him.
</P>
<P>
   He took credit for his 1991 vote to authorize President Bush to
make war on Iraq, a position Bradley, as senator, opposed. But for
Congress' voting to support the war, he said, Saddam Hussein
``would still be in Kuwait.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehane said that after Gore returned to Washington on Wednesday
night, the vice president would not campaign again until next year.
although he might issue some statements next week.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ After interviewing refugees from the fighting in
Chechnya, an international human rights group said Wednesday that
Russian troops had pillaged a small village there this month and
killed 17 civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The group, Human Rights Watch, said it had conducted interviews
with 15 survivors and that the killings took place in the village
of Alkhan-Yurt, a settlement 10 miles southwest of the Chechen
capital, Grozny, which has been the scene of fierce fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The allegation has emerged as an important test of the Russian
military's credibility, its ability to maintain discipline in its
ranks and its concern for Chechnya's civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Russian military spokesmen have denied that the episode could
have taken place, even as an investigation by Russian authorities
appears to be under way.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of Human Rights Watch have been interviewing
Chechen civilians as they have fled to neighboring Ingushetia,
chronicling abuses by both Russian troops and Chechen rebels.
Residents from Alkhan-Yurt have told them that Russian soldiers
engaged in widespread looting, shooting anyone who tried to stop
them.
</P>
<P>
   Khamid Khazuyev, a local policeman, was one of the victims,
according to Rachel Denber, a deputy director of Human Rights Watch
who helped document the episode. Many of the town's residents had
given Khazuyev their possessions to look after. Russian soldiers on
an armored personnel carrier shot him dead on Dec. 4, raided his
house and burned the home, according to accounts provided to Human
Rights Watch by Khazuyev's wife and neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have interviewed 15 people from this town whose testimony
was credible and mutually confirming,'' Ms. Denber said. ``It has
given us a pretty clear picture of the atrocity that happened at
Alkhan-Yurt.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time that Chechnya's civilians have
complained of abuses on the part of the Russian military. During
the 1994-1996 war, Russian troops went on a rampage in the village
of Samashki, throwing grenades into cellars occupied by civilians.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Moscow asserts, it is determined to win over the
Chechen population by restoring basic services and opening schools
and to deprive the Islamic fighters of the popular support that
would make it easier for them to wage a prolonged guerrilla war.
</P>
<P>
   When there have been abuses, the Russians have sometimes made a
show of punishing the culprits. Russian authorities arrested a
group of soldiers who drove their armored personnel carrier into
the market at Ordzhonikidzevskaya in Ingushetia and killed a young
woman who refused to sell them vodka.
</P>
<P>
   The case of Alkhan-Yurt, however, has produced a somewhat
muddled response from Russian authorities. A Russian spokesman
threatened to sue Human Rights Watch for defaming the Russian
military, though the organization says it has been told a military
inquiry is under way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The actions of the Russian troops, including Interior Ministry
troops, are under the strict control of the military prosecutor's
office,'' said Alexander Mikhailov, a senior official at the
Russian government agency that organizes news coverage of the war.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The trouble in Alkhan-Yurt began after it was occupied by a
group of Islamic militants, including Chechen and Middle Eastern
fighters. Hoping to avoid a Russian attack on their settlement,
village elders sought to persuade the rebels to leave. They also
appealed to Gen. Vladimir Shamanov, the commander of the Western
Group of Forces, which had surrounded the town.
</P>
<P>
   But the militants threatened the villagers and insisted on
staying. Soon the town turned into a battleground. Russian forces
pummeled the town with artillery and then fought the militants for
control of the destroyed village.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers finally entered the village on Dec. 1 and appeared
to believe that the losses they had sustained in taking the town
gave them the right to loot it. The soldiers were ``kontraktniki,''
volunteers who join the Russian military for pay, residents say.
</P>
<P>
   The rampage continued for two weeks, but the villagers who fled
say the first five days were the worst. According to accounts by
Human Rights Watch, the Russian soldiers threw grenades into
civilian shelters and summarily executed villagers.
</P>
<P>
   Hanpasha Dudayev, 60, was one of the first to be killed. He was
shot when he tried to stop Russian troops from raiding his home in
what human rights workers said was a grisly pattern.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the Russian troops sought to prevent the villagers
from leaving. But three later bribed their way out and made their
way to Ingushetia, where talk about Alkhan-Yurt began to surface.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Malak Sidulayev, a millionaire Chechen
businessmen who comes from the town and supports the Russians in
the war, has sought to publicize the abuses. He arranged a visit by
the British Broadcasting Corp., which has asserted that more than
40 Chechens were killed by Russian troops.
</P>
<P>
   Sidulayev and Human Rights Watch say they believe that the
Russian military is investigating the episode. Human Rights Watch
has urged the United Nations to appoint an independent commission
to investigate human rights violations by Russian forces in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand that the military is now investigating what
happened, but it is imperative that international agencies also be
part of the investigation,'' Ms. Denber said.

HE'S OFF HIS ROCKER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Matthew Prior was a satirist, not a sportswriter.
There was a difference, back in the late 1600s and early 1700s when
Prior was at the top of his game.
</P>
<P>
   Prior, an English poet, pitched observations like they were
high-and-tight fastballs. All these centuries later, his words have
lost none of their zing.
</P>
<P>
   Lord knows they're as accurate as ever. Prior could have been
targeting the modern-day athlete when he wrote, ``They always talk,
who never think.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, athletes continue to flock to Reggie White's
congregation for the incongruous and just plain insensitive.
</P>
<P>
   This past fall alone we saw Florida State receiver Peter Warrick
wonder what all the fuss was about when his deep clothing discount
unraveled. As he put it, ``It's not like I killed the president.''
</P>
<P>
   We heard Houston Rockets forward Charles Barkley's knee tear and
then we heard him crack, ``Just what this country needs. Another
unemployed black man.''
</P>
<P>
   And just when we thought there wasn't a runaway quote that could
blindside us, along came Atlanta closer John Rocker's drive-time
commentary on traffic and other such nuisances with a Sports
Illustrated reporter riding shotgun.
</P>
<P>
   By the time we reached the end of Jeff Pearlman's article on
Rocker in this week's issue, we were clear on one thing:
</P>
<P>
   Rocker may be able to tune out a stadium of screaming New
Yorkers and throw fireballs without getting burned, but he can't
drive and think at the same time. You don't have to be Jeff Gordon
to recognize a caution flag automatically comes out whenever your
passenger is a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   It's never expedient to swear at other drivers and flip them off
and trash an entire culture's acumen behind the wheel of an Acura.
But it's especially inadvisable when it's done in front of someone
with whom you are conducting a piece of business.
</P>
<P>
   There's putting your best foot forward and then there's putting
your foot in your mouth. Rocker was guilty of the latter, and not
just in his harsh assessment of female Asian drivers.
</P>
<P>
   His description of New York City subway riders was colorful in
the way a 3-year-old's crayon drawings are.
</P>
<P>
   And Rocker certainly isn't going to win himself any fans with
his condemnation of the city's rainbow of residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a big fan of foreigners,'' Rocker said, never minding
that there are plenty of people who regard his home state of
Georgia as a kind of alien land.
</P>
<P>
   John is really off his Rocker if he thinks all his teammates
will be cool with him calling out reserve shortstop Ozzie Guillen
for his awkward handling of a John Olerud bouncer up the middle
that scored two runs and effectively handed Game 4 of the National
League Championship Series to the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Walt (Weiss) is playing shortstop instead of Ozzie, that's
not a hit and we win,'' Rocker said. ``But we had a (35-year-old)
guy playing shortstop and he can't make that kind of play.''
</P>
<P>
   That turned out to be a mild rebuke, next to Rocker's
description of an overweight black teammate as ``a fat monkey.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Marge Schott has company in baseball's bullpen of
bigotry.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Rocker doesn't see the connection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a racist or prejudiced person,'' he told Sports
Illustrated. ``But certain people bother me.''
</P>
<P>
   All it takes is a couple of emotional exhibitionists baring
their souls to get us thinking that maybe Knicks star Patrick Ewing
has the right idea: If you can't say anything that won't end up in
big, bold headlines, don't talk to the press at all.
</P>
<P>
   It pains us to admit we've reached the point of semi-yearning
for the olden days when star athletes were unfinished portraits,
the better to allow the public to color in their personalities as
it liked.
</P>
<P>
   Time was when we thought it a noble calling, poking and prodding
until we uncovered precisely what makes the very best athletes
tick. We cast our curiosity into the sea of sports and were
henceforth hooked.
</P>
<P>
   Little did we realize then that to wade deeper into the psyches
of athletes is to risk ending up feeling as out of sorts as the
cowcod reeled in from the ocean's depths. In our naivete, it never
dawned on us that the physical aggression that is rewarded on the
field can be harder to turn off than the television.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't stop to consider that stardom can be an addictive
drug, impairing the judgment of the person in the spotlight and
leading to illegal, immoral and unimaginable behavior.
</P>
<P>
   It never crossed our minds that athletes are driven to excel not
only by desire but by demons.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't stop to ponder the possibility that the pitcher who'll
pugnaciously challenge the game's best hitters and the league's
orneriest fans was acting consistent with his personality and not
merely acting.
</P>
<P>
   It never seemed conceivable that a receiver so good at running
from defenders might have have reason to flee the police.
</P>
<P>
   To know better, we have discovered, is to feel worse. &QL;

CHRISTMASTIME MANHATTAN, ALWAYS FRENZIED, GOES MOONSTRUCK
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By GLENN COLLINS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In this, the last holiday aria of the century, New
York is a town of signs and portents. It's a pre-millennial
menagerie, a sideshow city, a place of small curiosities and large
paradoxes.
</P>
<P>
   Regard the handwritten signs posted Wednesday in Forbidden
Planet, the science-fiction comic-book emporium on East 13th
Street. Decorated with cheery plastic holly and red ribbons, they
proclaimed a message to the future: ``Merry Christmas from the 20th
century.''
</P>
<P>
   But merry Christmas to whom? Consider the conservatively dressed
gentleman in the silk tie and black cashmere overcoat who
tirelessly roamed midtown Manhattan in recent days. Like a prophet
of doom, he bewildered tourists with his messages of millennial
wrath.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the moonstruck Christmas _ celebrated under the
brightest, closest moon of the year _ or call it fin-de-siecle
lunacy. Whatever. The fact is that Susie Gaeta, a full-time
professional dog walker for Lee's Pet Care, finally succumbed to
the urge to dress her dogs in Santa suits this week. Strutting in
Midtown, Minnie the Italian greyhound, Amelia the Irish setter mix,
Zachary the Wheaton terrier and Remi the short-haired pointer _ all
of them drew oohs and aahs from adoring crowds at the apparition of
their red-and-white caps and coats (with black buttons, of course).
They had attained the status of seasonal wonder.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the greatest oddity of this week was the New York
Paradox: In certain places, at certain times, the city had an eerie
emptiness, revealing the defection of office workers who had
already taken that early holiday slide. But elsewhere? Let's just
say it took about an ice age for shivering skaters to traverse the
overflowing lines at the Rockefeller Plaza rink.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though some office workers are on vacation, there are many
more tourists driving into Manhattan,'' said Inspector James
Hegarty, commander of the Traffic Control Division. The net effect,
he explained, is that ``the week before Christmas is the busiest of
the year.''
</P>
<P>
   How busy? Even the clerks and secretaries in the division have
been directed out into the streets for enforcement duty in recent
days, Hegarty said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet on Wall Street, so many people have been taking
pre-Christmas days off that at odd times the cathedral-ish spaces
of the World Financial Center have been strangely quiet, though
incongruously a-riot with golden cascades of Christmas lights.
</P>
<P>
   Tanya Kolenko and her 67-year-old father-in-law, Anatoly, were
taking a breather there in splendid isolation on a quiet bench
under a titanic palm tree. They had logged just about enough
wonders for a while, thank you. ``I'm taking him sightseeing, and
this place is really a sight,'' she said. Kolenko, who lives in
Chisinau in Moldova, is spending the week visiting his son's family
in Bensonhurst.
</P>
<P>
   Across West Street, Tom Costanzo, an engineer for the Port
Authority, waited at the America's Coffee shop outside One World
Trade Center while his favorite barista, Peter Harris, barista-ized
his coffee. Harris allowed that he didn't mind holiday vacation
absences all that much. ``It's a great opportunity,'' Costanzo
said, ``when the phones stop ringing. You can really catch up on
your work.''
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, for the first time this year customers ``want
silver and gold trim on their wreaths and flower arrangements,''
said Thomas Barbagianis, an owner of Ariston Florist on Fifth
Avenue at 14th Street, ``probably because everyone hopes to get
rich in the millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   If the city trembled with terrorist jitters or Y2K paranoia, all
of that seemed to be repressed in a frenzy of shop-till-you-drop
acquisitiveness. Lorenzo Gori-Montanelli, a photographer who lives
in Lower Manhattan, did brisk business at his Curbstone Inc. stall
in the Union Square flea market selling his original photographs of
fire hydrants, manhole covers and wooden water towers. He had
transformed them into refrigerator magnets, T-shirts and clocks.
``It's a tricky way to get people to buy your photography,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   At times, lines at the Saks Fifth Avenue and Macy's store
windows were longer than ever, but conditions were sort of chancy
outside the stores this season as they were everywhere else. The
trip into the big town was nothing less than ``our big American
extravaganza,'' said Sarah Ahlgrim, who had driven from Westport,
Conn., with her three children and her 68-year-old father, Jim
Conduit. He was visiting from his home in Nottingham, England.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this place is a zoo now, what would you call it at the
millennium?'' asked Chuck Re, who was strolling nearby at
Rockefeller Plaza, holding hands with his wife, Judi. Re, a
storage-company manager from Southbury, Conn., had hoisted his
2-year-old daughter, Maggie Murphy Re, to his shoulders. The family
was ``doing the Music Hall, doing Macy's, doing Schwarz's,'' he
explained, referring to F.A.O.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere, holiday spells had transformed the mundane.
Wednesday, World Financial Center workers who rushed to the
mainland over the no man's land of West Street on the enclosed
pedestrian bridge were in actuality traversing the Holiday Bridge
Market. The collection of more than a dozen temporary stores formed
``Santa's Winter Wonderland,'' the signs announced.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, while New York puzzled over the signs and portents
of all that is new, the city seemed to find comfort in much that is
old. People flocked to the traditional, to the tried-and-true, to
St. Patrick's Cathedral, to Saks Fifth Avenue, to the twin towers.
And of course, they swarmed to Gage &AMP; Tollner, a restaurant on
Fulton Street in Brooklyn, which is 120 years old ``and now
celebrating the turn of the century for the second time,'' said
Nato Giordano, the general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night at 6 _ just as it will be done Thursday night
and just as it was done on the last Christmas of the last century _
a waiter held high a glowing wax candle wick. Methodically, he
lighted the 36 brass gas lamps in the venerable dining room.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a calming thing,'' Giordano said, gazing at the lamps as
they imparted a soft glow to the wreaths about the dining room.
``People are more stressed out this year than I can remember,'' he
said. ``Then they step through those revolving doors, and they're
in this whole other world. I think they can't wait until all this
is over.''

EWING COMES THROUGH AS KNICKS EDGE RAPTORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He had not taken a shot in the fourth quarter and for
all of 47 minutes stood in the background like an old sofa. Patrick
Ewing was comfortable and still usable, but no longer the focal
point of this plush, new living room. With 21.3 seconds left and
the game against the Raptors tied, the Knicks seemed
discombobulated on offense when Larry Johnson dumped the ball
inside to the aging warrior.
</P>
<P>
   But with the shot clock about to expire, Ewing turned around on
Antonio Davis and released a soft, fall-away jump shot a few inches
right of the free-throw line. It rattled in, Madison Square Garden
rose and roared, and suddenly all of Vince Carter's scintillating
vertical leap and Latrell Sprewell's scoring savvy mattered little.
</P>
<P>
   In the last game of the century inside Madison Square Garden,
the old man delivered a 91-90 victory over the Toronto Raptors.
Despite some shaky free-throwing shooting in the final seconds from
Sprewell, the Knicks managed to survive and record their seventh
victory in the last eight games.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell was awesome for 10 minutes of the second half, ending
with 25 points to lead New York. And Allan Houston was his reliable
self from the perimeter for most of the night, chipping in 18
points. But Ewing (eight points, eight rebounds) brought the Knicks
home after a wild Toronto comeback from 15 points down in the final
eight minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, the brilliant rookie, threw down five dunks and led
everyone with 36 points. He made 13 of 25 shots, none bigger than a
rainbow jumper with 40.7 seconds left. Coming off a screen from
Davis, his right foot slightly kicked up like, yes, Michael Jordan,
Carter tied the game at 86-86 with that shot.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks came down on offense with no cohesion. Johnson had
the ball at the top of the key and kept motioning for Sprewell to
go down in the post to start the play. But Sprewell stood there on
the perimeter, unsure of where to go. Sensing doom, Johnson tried
to dribble out of trouble before finding Ewing, who essentially
brought an end to a regular-season keepsake.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell went to the line with 2.3 seconds left and New York
nursing only a one-point lead. Having missed one free throw
already, he missed the first and, it seemed, purposely missed the
second free throw. Doug Christie's off-balance half-court, runner
from the right side then barely grazed the rim as the Knicks
escaped.
</P>
<P>
   New York had an 82-67 lead with 8:34 left, but Toronto made it a
game, going on a 15-2 run that trimmed the lead to just 84-82 with
2:11 left. Carter scored the last four points of the run as the
Knicks collapsed on offense and rotated badly on defense.
</P>
<P>
   Before then, it was all Sprewell.
</P>
<P>
   In a burst somewhat reminiscent of his Game 5 explosion in the
playoff finals last June, Sprewell scored 12 straight points at the
end of the third quarter and the outset of the fourth to help the
Knicks pull away. Losing his man by dribbling hard and driving to
either side, he would stop and pull up for medium-range jump shots
that fell softly through the net, his right arm held high,
following each shot through the rim.
</P>
<P>
   He was feeling it, and there was nothing the Raptors could do to
simmer him down.
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight game, Van Gundy elected to go with a
bigger lineup featuring Houston and Sprewell in the backcourt,
Marcus Camby alongside Johnson and Ewing on the frontline and
Charlie Ward on the bench to start the game.
</P>
<P>
   The move paid dividends in overtime against the Charlotte
Hornets on Monday night, and the Knicks parlayed that performance
into an even more convincing effort for most of the evening
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   They still had to contend with Carter, the most breathtaking
player in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   So explosive around the basket, the muscular 6-foot-6-inch
forward resembled a young Dominique Wilkens in the first half. He
wowed the Garden early, catching what appeared to be an errant
alley-oop pass from Doug Christie somewhere near the rafters. He
caught the ball at its apex before throwing it down hard with his
right hand.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, he caught a pass on the right block, took one
power dribble underneath the basket and slammed the ball through as
Sprewell fouled him. He was not only too quick and athletic; at 22
years old he was also too strong.
</P>
<P>
   When he wasn't dunking, Carter was depositing long jumps shots
with regularity. He had 18 points at intermission, hitting 7 of 11
shots over whatever helpless Knicks defender was assigned to guard
him. At times, though, he became such a focal point of Toronto's
offense that the other Raptors scorers, including Tracy McGrady and
Christie, were reduced to minor roles.
</P>
<P>
   Even with Sprewell's second-half binge, other Knicks contributed
and blended in seamlessly. Toronto has the amazing player. For now,
New York still has the better team.  &QL;

ELIAS SCORES TWO GOALS AS DEVILS WIN BY ONE

<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The Devils and the Flyers, the strongest
teams in the Atlantic Division as the season nears its midway
point, met for the third time Wednesday night and the Devils got
the upper hand with a 3-2 victory.
</P>
<P>
   But even though this was a game between two of the league's best
teams and longtime divisional rivals, there were still 1,000 empty
seats at Continental Arena, which has yet to see a sellout after 19
games this season. The Devils failed to sellout even a game against
the Rangers on Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   A large contingent in the crowd of 18,098 Wednesday cheered for
the visitors, but everyone in the building cheered for Coach Roger
Neilson of the Flyers, who is undergoing chemotherapy for bone
cancer and will have a bone marrow transplant late in February.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils posted their second victory of the season over the
Flyers (19-11-5), who lead the division with 44 points, 1 more than
the Devils (19-11-3).
</P>
<P>
   Patrik Elias' second goal of the game, on a power play 7 minutes
30 seconds into the third period, broke a 2-2 tie as the Devils
bounced back after they lost to the Islanders Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Elias opened the scoring with 5:36 left before the first
intermission when he picked up the puck off the left boards and
beat John Vanbiesbrouck from close range. It was his fifth goal of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Arnott gave the Devils a two-goal lead 6:03 into the
middle period. He sneaked behind the Flyers' defense on the left
and converted a pass from Elias. The goal was Arnott's ninth of the
season and came during the first manpower advantage for the Devils.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers, who came into the game as the league's most
efficient team on the power play, failed on their first advantage,
which lasted only 43 seconds. But they capitalized on their second
one, only 20 seconds after it started.
</P>
<P>
   John LeClair scored the goal, his 19th, as he swatted the puck
out of the air after a shot by Eric Desjardins with 6:10 left in
the period.
</P>
<P>
   It got worse for the Devils. Keith Jones tied the game 30
seconds later, when he scored on a rebound from a shot by LeClair
and scored his third goal of the season. It sent the teams into the
second intermission tied at 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   On a night of emotion for the ailing Flyers' coach, the first
truly warm moment came in the sixth minute of the game, when
Neilson was greeted with a standing ovation after he appeared on
the scoreboard screen standing behind the Flyers' bench during a
break. A graphic on the scoreboard read ``Good Luck, Roger. Our
Thoughts &AMP; Prayers Are With You.''
</P>
<P>
   Neilson waved to the crowd in appreciation. Before the game,
standing against the wall outside the Flyers' dressing room, the
67-year-old coach said he was touched by the outpouring of support
from people in hockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hockey community is a little closer than most sports,''
Neilson said. ``I've heard from a couple of players and coaches
from every team. Even from referees.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Wednesday night's referees, Paul Stewart, who was treated
for colon cancer last year, held a cordial conversation with
Neilson before the game. &QL;

FILMMAKER SAYS U.S. SUPPRESSED HIS WORK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Mich.)  (js) 
 By C.J. CHIVERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Last summer, as he contemplated the news media's
coverage of plans for New Year's Eve, Michael Zieper, an
independent film maker, conceived a script that would explore the
themes of distrust for the government and public anxiety over the
new century. What if, he wondered, the U.S. Army were to incite an
enormous race riot at the stroke of midnight on Dec. 31, as the
streets become darkened by computer-related power failures? What if
it were to happen in Times Square?
</P>
<P>
   Zieper's musings became the subject of ``Military Takeover of
New York City,'' a six-minute film he produced and posted on the
Internet in October. Wednesday, the authorities' response to the
film became the subject of a federal lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on behalf of Zieper, 39, and Mark Wieger, 38, an
independent Web site operator, the American Civil Liberties Union
filed a suit claiming that the FBI and the U.S. attorney's office
in New York used coercion to suppress the film, which was made as
if it were a secret military training tape of ways to provoke a
Midtown riot.
</P>
<P>
   According to the suit, an FBI special agent and an assistant U.
S. attorney pressured Wieger to block access to the movie's Web
address, which is http://www.crowdedtheater.com, telling him by
telephone in November that they did not want any more people
viewing it and that his business could suffer if he did not comply
with their wishes.
</P>
<P>
   Wieger at first agreed to the request, deleting the film from
the Web on Nov. 15. But about 10 days later, after being inundated
with complaints from Internet users, he restored the movie to his
server, where it remains available for viewing, albeit with a new
link Zieper designed to explain that it is fiction. Zieper, who
lives in New Jersey, and Wieger, who lives in Michigan, said that
the government had not inquired further about the movie since it
was restored to the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The suit claims that the FBI and the U.S. attorney's office
violated Zieper's and Wieger's rights to due process and free
speech by pressuring them to restrict access to the film without
any court review of the film's contents. It seeks unspecified
monetary damages, lawyers' fees and a court declaration that
``Military Takeover of New York'' is constitutionally protected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make it very clear today that we applaud the FBI's
effort to fight real threats of terrorism, including those that
surround the millennium,'' said Ann Beeson, a lawyer with the Civil
Liberties Union. ``But censoring artists is certainly not the way
to make people safe this New Year's Eve.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the FBI and the U.S. attorney's office declined to comment.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Military Takeover of New York City'' has only one character:
an Army officer whose face is never seen. He is merely a voice
talking over a tape of Times Square traffic, telling his soldiers _
Cracker, Raven, Hobo and Boyzen _ what their missions will be on
New Year's Eve. The officer's plan is simple. A woman will falsely
claim that she was raped. Soldiers in civilian clothes will
circulate through the crowd and spread rumors and fear. And as
computer glitches cause power failures and confusion, the crowd's
unease will erupt in violence and chaos, forcing the military to
``sweep and clear'' Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is how it all goes down; I'm going to walk you through
it,'' the officer says, and then he does, giving each of his team
members instructions in blunt, sometimes profanity-laced language.
</P>
<P>
   Zieper and the ACLU say that the film is meant to provoke
serious discussion of serious issues: the public's concerns about
millennium-related problems, the depth of the nation's racial
problems and distrust for the government. And they say the film was
made in the spirit of Orson Welles' ``War of the Worlds,'' a 1938
radio drama about an alien invasion that some listeners mistook for
a newscast.
</P>
<P>
   Emily Whitfield, a Civil Liberties Union spokeswoman, said the
government had overreacted. ``It's akin to them hearing about `The
Blair Witch Project' and running off into the woods to hunt down
the witch,'' she said.

RETIRED FBI AGENT IS ACCUSED OF CONSPIRING WITH MOBSTERS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A federal grand jury here indicted a retired FBI agent
Wednesday on charges that he conspired in crimes with two reputed
mob leaders who had been longtime FBI informers.
</P>
<P>
   The agent, John J. Connolly Jr., who has denied all wrongdoing,
has been a central figure in a long-playing federal case here
against the reputed mobsters, James Bulger and Stephen J. Flemmi,
that has raised questions about just how much FBI agents protected
their criminal activities. The case has been an embarrassment to
the FBI and could have broad implications for the often-murky
relationships between law-enforcement officials and criminal
informers.
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi has testified that one of his FBI handlers (not Connolly)
told him, ``You can do whatever you want, just don't clip
anybody.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Connolly's lawyer, R. Robert Popeo, said Wednesday night that
his client was being prosecuted for doing his duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I characterize this indictment as outrageous,'' Popeo said,
adding that Connolly ``did his job, he did it well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has been embarrassed by the Bulger case,
he said, and ``that's fine but don't change the rules of the road
retroactively.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Connolly pleaded not guilty Wednesday night to charges of
racketeering, obstruction of justice and conspiring to commit
racketeering and obstruction of justice. He was released on
$200,000 bail, Stern said.
</P>
<P>
   The racketeering charge accuses Connolly of taking a series of
gifts and cash from Bulger and Flemmi for his superior, John
Morris, between 1981 and 1987. Morris, who has been granted
immunity, has admitted in court that he took the gifts.
</P>
<P>
   The racketeering charge also involves the FBI's failure to
investigate accusations that Bulger and Flemmi had illegally taken
over a liquor store.
</P>
<P>
   The obstruction of justice charge concerns an accusation that
Connolly, who retired in 1990, tipped off Flemmi in 1988 about an
FBI wiretap and in 1995 about a grand jury indictment that was
about to come down against Flemmi, Bulger and others.
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi is in prison awaiting trial on other racketeering
charges, but Bulger fled and remains on the run, one of the FBI's
10 most wanted fugitives.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly has maintained that he knew that Bulger and Flemmi,
were no angels, but that he was following accepted procedure and
kept his superiors informed of the criminals' doings.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship with the mobsters began during a period in the
1960s and '70s when the FBI was intent upon crushing La Cosa
Nostra, he has said, and was willing to strike deals with criminals
perceived as lesser threats.
</P>
<P>
   Donald K. Stern, the U.S. attorney here, said Wednesday night
that ``these charges are serious and reflect a corrupt and
long-term relationship between persons in the business of
extortion, bribery and loan-sharking, and an FBI agent who
protected them from prosecution.''
</P>
<P>
   The indictments stem from months of investigation by a special
Justice Department task force composed of prosecutors and FBI
agents with no Boston ties.
</P>
<P>
   The practices used in the handling of Bulger and Flemmi, as they
have emerged in federal court here, have been so disturbing that
they spurred a monthslong policy review by the Justice Department
that, officials said this spring, would surely lead to new rules
requiring agents to share more about the relationships with
informers.
</P>
<P>
   Such relationships tend to be so delicate that they are often
agents' most closely guarded secrets _ and can often lead to their
greatest coups. Much has been made of the fact that Connolly and
Bulger came from the same South Boston neighborhood, and that their
personal rapport powerfully bolstered their professional
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly has refused to testify in the federal court case, but
he said in an interview earlier this year that he believed Flemmi
and Bulger should receive immunity for crimes, like loansharking,
that they committed with the government's knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   It was understood, he said, that they could commit crimes, so
long as they were not violent. There was a very basic calculation
at work, he said: ``We were going to use a gang of two to get rid
of a gang of 42.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Chemical analysis of dirty dishes and drinking cups found 42
years ago in a tomb in Turkey has given archaeologists revealing
clues to what ancients considered a feast fit for a king, perhaps
the King Midas of the legendary golden touch.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone dined on barbecued lamb or goat in a spicy stew with
lentils. They washed this down with a potent mixed drink of grape
wine, barley beer and mead. Judging by the size of three huge
bronze cauldrons _ the reservoirs of drink _ a good and not very
sober time was had by all.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion was a royal funeral 2,700 years ago at Gordion,
capital of the powerful Phrygian kingdom, where Midas ruled around
700 B.C. After eating and drinking, the mourners lowered the log
coffin of their king into the tomb, along with wooden dining tables
and hundreds of bronze serving vessels, drinking cups and pottery
jars. Out of either tipsy slovenliness or some custom, they did not
bother to wash the dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists at the University of Pennsylvania, using advanced
techniques of chemical analysis, have now made the most of the
dregs and leftovers. They describe the menu of the royal funerary
feast in a report being published in Thursday's issue of the
journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our findings have an important bearing on the cultural
antecedents of Midas' Phrygian kingdom and on the wider application
of molecular archaeological techniques to other ancient foods and
beverages,'' Dr. Patrick E. McGovern and colleagues wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The chemical examination of congealed clumps of leftovers in
pottery jars and other vessels produced traces of fatty acids,
cholesterol and triglycerides, identifying sheep or goat as the
entree. Carbon remains suggested that the meat had been barbecued.
</P>
<P>
   Other compounds showed that legume seeds, probably lentils, had
been added to the stew, along with olive oil, honey and wine. For
spice, the Phrygian chefs tossed in a dash of Mediterranean herbs,
either anise or fennel.
</P>
<P>
   Scrapings from the bronze cauldrons and the drinking cups
revealed the presence of tartaric acid, calcium oxalate and
beeswax, evidence of a wine-beer-mead punch known to the Greeks as
kykeon. And there seemed to be plenty to go around.
</P>
<P>
   Because about 100 drinking cups were found in the tomb and each
of the three cauldrons had a 33-gallon capacity, McGovern said in
an interview, each of the feasting mourners could have consumed a
gallon of joy.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists and other scholars at the University of Pennsylvania
Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology said the new findings
provided, in the words of one, ``dramatic, direct evidence of
ancient Mediterranean cuisine and custom.''
</P>
<P>
   Previous evidence of funerary feasts in antiquity came from a
few texts. The Hittites, whose empire flourished before the eighth
century B.C. in what is now southern Turkey and northern Syria,
left cuneiform tablets describing food being offered to mourners at
royal burials. In Homer's Iliad, the Trojans feasted and drank a
mixed fermented beverage at the burial of Hector.
</P>
<P>
   Now scholars can almost smell and taste the banquets they once
could only read about. Indeed, the Pennsylvania museum has
announced that it is planning to re-create a King Midas feast next
fall.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Because the practice of mixing fermented drinks was common in
the Greek world of the time, archaeologists say, finding the
residues of a similar drink at the Gordion tomb is compelling new
evidence that the Phrygians arrived in that region from Europe,
probably northern Greece or Bulgaria. The site of Gordion is in
what is now central Turkey, near Ankara.
</P>
<P>
   The tomb supposedly holding Midas was discovered in 1957 by a
University of Pennsylvania team of archaeologists led by Dr. Rodney
S. Young. Within a mound more than 150 feet high and 1,000 feet
wide, the archaeologists found the well-preserved wooden tomb and a
log coffin containing the skeleton of a king, age 60 to 65.
</P>
<P>
   Around the coffin stood elaborately inlaid wooden furniture,
some of the earliest and best-preserved furniture in the world. The
three bronze cauldrons were resting on iron tripods. Inside the
cauldrons were many of the smaller pottery vessels and the drinking
cups.
</P>
<P>
   The rancid smell of spoiled meat overwhelmed the archaeologists
when they opened the tomb. At first, they suspected that the
furnishings and the residues of food and drink might have been
placed there solely for the king's use in the hereafter.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Elizabeth Simpson, who has spent years studying the tomb
furnishings, said she was reminded more of the remains of a grand
feast in the manner of those associated with burials throughout the
ancient world. The feast, she said, was presumably held outdoors
near the tomb, there being no room inside for the many mourners.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the discovery, Dr. Simpson, a research associate at
the university museum and also at the Bard Graduate Center for
Studies of Decorative Arts in New York City, became the first to
propose the chemical study of the feast's leftovers. The results
then were inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have the kind of analytical instruments then that we
have now,'' McGovern said. ``We've really come a long way in 40
years. Most archaeology focuses on the examination of inorganic
materials. But it's the organic that can tell us what people ate
and drank, among other important things.''
</P>
<P>
   The samples extracted from the jars and bowls were analyzed by
such techniques as infrared spectrometry, high-performance liquid
chromatography-mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass
spectrometry. Collaborating with McGovern's group in the testing
were scientists from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, SmithKline
Beecham Pharmaceuticals, Vassar College and Scientific Instrument
Services. The research was supported by a grant from the J.M.
Kaplan Fund, a frequent underwriter of archaeological innovation.
</P>
<P>
   For McGovern, an archaeochemist, the Midas menu was the piece de
resistance to his years of research on the food and drink of
antiquity. He had previously examined residues of clay pots to
determine the earliest known wine, from 5400 B.C., and the earliest
known barley beer, from 3400 B.C. Both were found at ruins in the
Zagros Mountains of Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Gordion tomb has never been positively identified
as that of King Midas, McGovern's group said in the journal report,
the association ``is strongly supported by the monumental size of
the earthen mound built over the tomb, the richness of the burial
goods and the contemporaneous Assyrian inscriptions.''
</P>
<P>
   If the mourners were in fact feasting to the memory of the Midas
who later became a figure of mythology, the irony is inescapable.
He was a real king of the Phrygians (one of several of their kings
of that name) but is famously remembered through a legend of
avarice. It was said of Midas that everything he touched, even his
food and drink, turned to gold. And so, rich as he was, he nearly
starved to death.

SITES CHALLENGE, BUT DON'T NECESSARILY TOP BCS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Someone is either defending the process or they're looking for
an alternative to the Bowl Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   And if you're looking for a good argument about the computer
system that determines college football's top two teams, try
cyberspace. Scores of amateur Webmasters have set up sites touting
their own rankings or power-rating formulas, and they all put in
their 2 cents on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Billingsley of Nashville, Tenn., who updates his
rankings weekly on the College Football Resource Center (cfrc.com),
said the idea of incorporating computers into the football
championship picture works for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I also recognize that very few computer formulas actually
reflect a purely objective poll,'' Billingsley said. ``A program is
only as good as the programmer.''
</P>
<P>
   Billingsley said the BCS rankings is a nice balance between
polls subjective to emotional and personal input, such as The
Associated Press and the USA Today/ESPN Coaches' Poll, and those
that are objective, such as the computer polls.
</P>
<P>
   But ``I would be absolutely against using only computers to
determine the championship game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Palm, a systems bank analyst in Chicago who operates his
own rankings at CollegeRPI.com, ``prefers'' using computers and a
formula to determine playoff teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each of these computer rankings is essentially one man's
opinion,'' he said. ``I think it helps to have some statistical
measure of teams to use at least as a guideline, and the more
opinions, the merrier.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Massey, a Virginia Tech graduate student in Vicksburg,
Va., who ranks teams on his Massey's Ratings and Rankings site
(www.mratings.com), has an interesting spin on the matter. It's one
that, if used by the BCS, would have taken Virginia Tech out of the
Nokia Sugar Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Massey said he'd like to see the BCS ratings used as a guide
rather than the rule. A final decision could be vetoed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This might answer some concerns of a cold, hard math formula
in a game full of emotions and circumstances that don't show up in
the numbers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's not all amateurs who have their eye on determining playoff
finalists. ISL United States, a marketing group in Norwalk, Ct.,
launched College Football Playoff 2000 (collegefootballplayoff.com)
to solicit support for a $3 billion playoff proposal. Fans can
voice their support with e-mail postcards directed at Division I-A
university presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Fans who support the official line can access the Bowl
Championship Series official site (abccfb.go.com), which is
operated by ABC Sports Online. The site has interactive and
multimedia features and updates.
</P>
<P>
   The unofficial word, of course, is all over the 'Net. David
Wilson of Madison, Wis., recognized the varying opinions and
created a portal (www.cae.wisc.edu/(tilde)dwilson/rsfc/rate).
</P>
<P>
   Massey said he recognizes the healthy debate caused by the BSC.
</P>
<P>
   ``While there may be room for some improvement, the BSC has
worked successfully in its two years of existence,'' he said. ``And
it has been a great topic of discussion for college football
fans.''
</P>
<P>

IT WAS DESTINY FOR WILLINGHAM

<P>
   SANTA MONICA _ Win or lose Jan. 1, Stanford head coach Tyrone
Willingham stands shoulder-to-shoulder with greatness.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the only other Cardinal coaches who have won the
conference and earned a Rose Bowl berth are legends named Pop
Warner, Clark Shaughnessy, Chuck Taylor and John Ralston. It's
something that even Bill ``the Genius'' Walsh never accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   As the 20th Century draws to a close, Willingham will forever be
remembered as the first coach of African-American descent to coach
a team in the ``Granddaddy of them All.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it carries some significance,'' Willingham said.
``It's not as important to me as it is to some others . . . I'm
just saddened that it's coming at this time and not a lot sooner.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, perhaps it was Willingham's destiny.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Jacksonville, N.C., Willingham, who turns 46 next
week, earned his degree in physical education from Michigan State
University in 1977. He also earned three letters there in both
football and baseball as a walk-on.
</P>
<P>
   As the Spartans' quarterback, Willingham was named the team's
most inspirational player in 1976. The next year he was awarded the
Big Ten Medal of Honor as the outstanding Scholar-Athlete in the
conference. In baseball he received the Sportsmanship Award in 1975
and was an All-Big Ten selection in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   From there Willingham went on to coaching assignments at Central
Michigan, Michigan State, North Carolina State, Rice University,
Stanford and the Minnesota Vikings before taking the head coaching
job at Stanford in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Willingham led the Cardinal to the Liberty Bowl in 1995 and the
Sun Bowl in 1996. Doing so made him just the third coach in
Stanford history to lead the team to consecutive bowl games in his
first two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But Willingham cautions those who would look to him as a hero or
desire to follow in his footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that no kid looks at me and says he wants to be like
me,'' Willingham said. ``I hope that that kid's eyes are set on
being better than coach Willingham. He should say, `I want to be
better, not just the same as coach Willingham.' ''
</P>
<P>
   That said, Willingham does admit there are those who had a big
influence on his career. His role models include his mother and
father as well as Dennis Green, head coach of the Minnesota Vikings
and a former head coach at Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a question, my mother and father have been my greatest
role models,'' Willingham said. ``I must include Dennis Green as
one of my influences. I spent six years coaching with Denny and
enjoyed his philosophy and could see the vision he had, not only
for himself but for the young men in his program.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching Willingham coach his team at Santa Monica College, it's
hard to imagine the soft-spoken guy with the polo shirt, khaki
shorts and perfectly fit Stanford cap has a reputation as a
disciplinarian.
</P>
<P>
   Then he takes the whistle dangling around his neck on a thick
cord that says ``Stanford'' and blows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the description of being a disciplinarian is true,''
Willingham admits. ``But, more importantly ... it has to be timely
... I think I have to be tough in some cases and a grandfather in
other cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever he is, Willingham, whose record at Stanford is 30-26-1,
is revered by his players and those who know him.
</P>
<P>
   He took a team that was 3-7-1 in 1994 and turned it into a 7-4-1
bowl team in 1995. In 1996, the team went 7-5 overall beating
Michigan State 38-0 in the Sun Bowl. In 1997, the
Willingham-coached Cardinal finished 5-6. Last year they were a
disappointing 3-8, but the turnaround has earned Willingham several
admirers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Tyrone a whole lot,'' said former Cardinal quarterback
Jim Plunkett, who led the team to the 1971 Rose Bowl. ``I'm glad to
see him doing so well and winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Troy Walters, who was offered a scholarship to
Stanford by Willingham when every other Division I-A school had
turned him down, was just as kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's probably the best coach I've ever had,'' Walters said.
``He's right up there with the great ones.'' &QL;

MCCAIN, GAY REPUBLICANS HAVE PUZZLING RELATIONSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an intriguing campaign dance, John McCain has
collected tens of thousands of dollars in contributions from
members of a gay Republican group with whom he disagrees on a broad
range of issues, from job-discrimination protection to benefits for
same-sex couples.
</P>
<P>
   The Log Cabin Republicans, whose spokesmen praised McCain's
willingness ``to have a dialogue,'' have chosen to help him despite
his disagreement with them on matters such as the decision Monday
by the Vermont Supreme Court that homosexual couples are entitled
to the same benefits as wedded couples.
</P>
<P>
   McCain spokesman Dan Schnur told ``The Arizona Republic'' that
the senator ``has indicated that he disagrees with the decision''
by the Vermont court.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also backs the ``Don't ask, don't tell'' policy on gays
in the military, putting him at odds with Steve May, a prominent
Log Cabin Republican supporter in Phoenix who is threatened with an
Army discharge because of his sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Yet on Dec. 14, McCain's campaign manager, Rick Davis,
simultaneously addressed members of the Log Cabin Republicans by
satellite television at fund-raisers in Boston, Chicago,
Minneapolis, New Orleans, New York, Seattle and Washington, D.C.,
and raised about $40,000 for the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix was not included because many members there had already
contributed to McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between the senator and gay Republicans was
noted earlier this month in the ``Washington Blade,'' a gay
newspaper that labeled McCain an ``enigma.''
</P>
<P>
   ``While he has an avowed `visceral dislike' of discrimination,
which presumably includes discrimination against gays, he has
consistently chosen to vote anti-gay. His actions over the years
have likewise sent mixed messages to gay voters,'' the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, McCain helped ensure the defeat of a bill, which lost
on a 50-49 vote, that would have barred employment discrimination
on the basis of sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Three years earlier, McCain was denounced by the National Gay
and Lesbian Task Force for agreeing to be keynote speaker at a
fund-raiser for an Oregon group that sponsored a ballot initiative
condemning homosexuality as ``perverse.'' His aides said at the
time that McCain's appearance didn't constitute an endorsement of
the group's views and that McCain considered tolerance a ``bedrock
value.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan to hold the joint December fund-raisers was the
brainchild of May, an openly gay Army reservist and state lawmaker
who says he supports and admires McCain but disagrees with him on
the policy permitting gays to serve in the military only as long as
their sexual orientation is not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the policy, the Army is moving to discharge May, who has
been open about his sexual orientation since he first ran for
office in 1996. May was honorably discharged in 1995, recalled this
year, and is now appealing to end what he calls the ``ludicrous''
policy that threatens his service even though he has earned stellar
performance evaluations.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, May's sister, unbeknownst to May, asked McCain about
the ``Don't ask, don't tell'' policy during the question-and-answer
portion of a speech the senator was giving at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   McCain told Shannon May, a Harvard senior, that if there were
problems with the policy, they should be looked into. But he
repeated his support for the policy, saying, according to the
Associated Press: ``Colin Powell, Norman Schwarzkopf, all the
military leaders I admire, came up with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve May sounded disappointed in an interview immediately after
he heard about McCain's response.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess McCain basically hid behind Generals Powell and
Schwarzkopf, didn't really want to address the question,'' he said.
``I really admire his leadership. He's a man I want in the Oval
Office. But I just hope that he is really willing to examine the
immorality, impracticality and absurdity of this (policy).''
</P>
<P>
   McCain recently told moderator Tony Snow on ``Fox News Sunday,''
``I want to sit down with (May), and look at the specifics of his
case.'' A meeting has been scheduled for Dec. 30 in Phoenix,
according to May.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope McCain's not saying he's going to meet with me so he
can deflect the issue. We never had a meeting scheduled until Tony
Snow asked him if he was going to meet with me,'' May said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was campaigning in South Carolina and could not be
interviewed, his campaign said. But Schnur, McCain's spokesman,
said, ``The Steve May story broke over a weekend. Upon hearing
about it, Senator McCain indicated that he wanted to meet with May
to find out the particulars of the way the case was handled.
Logistically, it wouldn't have been possible for him to arrange the
meeting before Snow asked him about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Schnur said that although McCain might disagree with Log Cabin
Republicans on some issues, they were in agreement on such things
as ``lower taxes and a strong national defense.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to GOP presidential front-runner George W. Bush, who
has thus far declined the group's invitation, McCain sat down with
members of the Log Cabin Republicans last month and said that he
would work to end discrimination, and that appears to be enough for
many gay Republicans, particularly when the senator's position is
compared with those of other presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking about those kind of values (McCain's) versus
people like Pat Buchanan, Gary Bauer and others who have
historically said that gays should not be in the Republican Party,
that we are people who should not have civil rights, that we should
be in programs because we're mentally ill,'' said Kevin Ivers, the
Log Cabin group's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said on ``Meet the Press'' last month that he would
``probably not'' meet with the group, adding, ``I am someone who is
a uniter, not a divider. I don't believe in group thought, pitting
one group against another.''
</P>
<P>
   Log Cabin members said they were confused by Bush's remarks, and
some wondered whether he might be fearful of repercussions from the
right. Southern lawmakers in particular were incensed at President
Clinton's proposal early in his first term to lift the ban on gays
in the military. When the plan was subjected to harsh congressional
criticism, Clinton modified it into what became popularly known as
``Don't ask, don't tell.''
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina's February primary is central to McCain's
campaign strategy, and he could be subject to attacks from
religious conservatives if they believed he had gone too far in
including gays under the Republican ``big tent.'' &QL;

MENIAL TASKS DEMEANING? NOT EVERYBODY SEES IT THAT WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Whaddya wanna do? Flip burgers yer whole
life?
</P>
<P>
   Flipping burgers is the cliche of the moment. We use it to mean
a low-wage, low-skill, limited-future job. We assume the listener
will say, ``No way, man,'' and be imbued with ambition and
career-climbing goals.
</P>
<P>
   Beware of that assumption.
</P>
<P>
   Last week I visited two sheltered workshops where four workers
were each honored for completing 30 years of simple assembly and
piecework _ with nearly perfect attendance records.
</P>
<P>
   On the day I visited IBS Industries in Blue Springs, Dennis
Parish's work consisted of putting two clear plastic vials and two
white plastic caps in a small clear plastic bag and putting the
assembled bag in a box with others. Then doing it again and again
and again.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, do you still like coming to work after all these years?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not?'' Dennis responded, with an economy of words but an
expression that spoke volumes.
</P>
<P>
   After a short time with him and his best friend and co-worker,
Butch Baker, it was easy to interpret his ``Why not?''
</P>
<P>
   What he said was: Why wouldn't I like coming here, where I joke
with my friends, where I'm complimented on a job well done, where
I'm rewarded for my efforts (even if it's just a fraction of the
minimum wage) and where I am a productive member of society who
adds value to my employer and to the companies with which it does
business?
</P>
<P>
   So, congratulations to Dennis Parish, Butch Baker, Marty Mann in
Blue Springs and Jimmy Campbell in Independence, and to their
fellow IBS workers who, whether they have 30 years on the job or
three, show diligence, a positive attitude and joy in their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't necessary, of course, to look to workers who have Down
syndrome to find examples of fulfillment at work. I have, over
several months, corresponded with a man who had been looking for
work, found temporary employment with the state of Missouri and
then re-entered the job market.
</P>
<P>
   A family at his church recognized he needed income and offered
him work in a Dairy Queen they own and operate in Cameron, Mo. Phil
Luebbert said he wrestled with himself but quickly ``made the
mental adjustment'' to be a burger flipper.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a blessing this job has turned into,'' Luebbert wrote.
``The little job here at Dairy Queen has intangible (psychological,
spiritual, moral) benefits which far outweigh what we usually think
of as job benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although this DQ pays less than half of what I earned at the
state, in many ways I have received more permanent, personal
benefits, such as faith in people, the existence of fairness, a
cheerful work environment...
</P>
<P>
   ``This job is so valuable, for I can weigh future jobs against
it (do they measure up?), and I have a renewed attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Luebbert thanks his DQ owners, Joe and Velma Seuferling, and
managers, Rita and Rodney Long, for that renewal.
</P>
<P>
   All the workers named in this column have found fulfillment at
work _ sometimes to the top of their abilities, sometimes only a
surface tap. That peace is a lovely gift.
</P>
<P>
   I hope you get it, too.

GOVERNOR CALLS ON STATE LEGISLATORS TO QUICKLY ENDORSE CUTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN A. DVORAK  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOPEKA, Kan. _ Proposed reductions in the Kansas budget are
going deeper than expected, and Gov. Bill Graves called on state
legislators Wednesday to quickly endorse cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a pretty tight fiscal situation,'' Graves said. He
added that legislators needed to realize the severity of the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Putting off tough decisions, he warned, will lead only to more
uncertainty over state spending in 2000 and worse trouble in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Graves said his proposed reductions in the general tax money
state agencies spent would average 1.6 percent. That equals about
$70 million altogether. Several months ago Graves said he would
institute reductions of 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The budget pinch comes despite a healthy Kansas economy. Boom
times have slowed a bit, however. Also, legislators in the past _
with support from Graves _ approved big tax cuts without curtailing
spending.
</P>
<P>
   Money will be one of the thorniest issues when the 2000 session
of the Kansas Legislature begins Jan. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Graves, a Republican, refused Wednesday to specify the state
programs he wanted reduced. Aid to public schools, however,
represents a possible target for cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Increasing the reductions from 1 percent to 1.6 percent does not
indicate that budget problems have worsened, the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we've gone through, on an agency-by-agency,
budget-by-budget review, we found places where we thought we could
shave more,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not all agencies will see their budgets lowered. ``We found
places where we needed to add money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Leading members of the Senate and House reacted differently
after hearing Graves' request for fast decisions next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll pull together,'' said Senate President Dick
Bond, an Overland Park Republican. ``If it isn't done early, then
it won't be done at all, and the budgetary process will be in
chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor said he would like a budget reduction bill passed
by about Jan. 21, and Bond echoed the call.
</P>
<P>
   However, Rep. Bill Reardon of Kansas City urged caution.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of state tax revenue coming in for 2000 is not
certain yet, said Reardon, top Democrat on the House Budget
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might well be better off to wait,'' he said. Of the call
for fast action, Reardon said: ``It's being portrayed as good
government, but I'm not sure it is good government.''
</P>
<P>
   Reardon said he feared that programs strongly favored by
Democrats, such as aid to public schools, faced cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans outnumber Democrats in the Legislature. But
Republicans have feuded among themselves for several years. As a
result, Graves and his GOP allies do not always get their way.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Adkins, a Leawood Republican who is chairman of the
House Appropriations Committee, said he wanted legislators to pass
a budget bill quickly, maybe in just one week.
</P>
<P>
   But the House is not always predictable, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are factions in the House who might see this as an
opportunity to throw a wrench in the works,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the pressure will be interest groups that will lobby
hard in an attempt to avoid reductions in state programs they
favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would expect,'' Graves said, ``that every constituency that
is negatively affected will express their concerns.''

 Politicians can't ignore flip-flops' potential fallout  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ 'Tis the season to be wary, as candidates on the
road to the White House engineer some sharp political U-turns that
may be detours from their past.
</P>
<P>
   Take Pat Buchanan, one of the more rigidly conservative
combatants ever to sport a lapel button. Seeking the presidential
nomination on the Reform ticket, he bolted the Republican Party,
where his roots go back three decades to Richard Nixon's
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan has welcomed the endorsement of longtime liberal
activist Lenora Fulani and said he would accept help from
homosexuals _ provided they lead scandal-free lives. This is the
same Pat Buchanan who delivered a fire-breathing speech against
liberalism at the 1992 GOP convention.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic hopeful Bill Bradley, meanwhile, embraced federal
subsidies for ethanol once he hit the campaign trail in Iowa.
Ethanol is a corn-based alternative fuel that potentially opens
another market for farmers. As a senator from New Jersey, Bradley
opposed such subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   The political flip-flop. It's a staple of the campaign season
and a time-honored tool to adjust to changing political
circumstances. But beware of the possible fallout.
</P>
<P>
   Former President George Bush learned that after reneging on his
``read my lips, no new taxes'' pledge in 1988. It came back to
haunt him in the 1992 campaign after he had supported a tax
increase as part of a budget deal with Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't help him any,'' said Ron Kaufman, a former political
director in the Bush White House. ``If a candidate is perceived to
be less than genuine or perceived to be hypocritical, it hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   Politicians should be allowed to change their positions, of
course, whether or not a campaign is on the horizon. Conditions
shift, and people are expected to adapt.
</P>
<P>
   The time frame, however, can be crucial. ``If someone changes
his view over 10 years, it's less damaging than if someone changes
over 10 days,'' said John Green, director of the Ray Bliss
Institute of Politics at Ohio's University of Akron.
</P>
<P>
   That was evident at a recent debate between the Republican
presidential candidates, when Texas Gov. George W. Bush thought he
had ensnared publisher Steve Forbes in his own words. Noting that
Forbes now opposes raising the eligibility age for Social Security
benefits, Bush unearthed a 1977 column in which Forbes had written
just the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   That was his opinion ``20-some-odd years ago when the system was
in crisis,'' Forbes countered, not now.
</P>
<P>
   In a more recent change of political emphasis, Forbes has been
outspoken against abortion, hoping to attract support from
religious conservatives. During his first presidential campaign
four years ago, however, Forbes avoided all talk on the subject,
saying only that he hoped abortion would ``vanish.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore has flip-flopped on tobacco. The
Democratic front-runner once touted his past as a tobacco farmer,
and he also has benefited from tobacco-industry contributions. But
at the 1996 Democratic convention, Gore gave a heartfelt speech
about the death from lung cancer of his sister, a longtime smoker.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impact his sister's death took awhile to really seep in
and what it meant about the impact of tobacco,'' Gore spokesman
Chris Lehane said. ``There is no one who has been a more outspoken
critic of the tobacco industry than Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign, meanwhile, has set its sights on Bradley's
political pivots. The two Democrats are in a dead heat as they
battle for votes in New Hampshire, scene of the first presidential
primary on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has charged that Bradley has flip-flopped on school
vouchers because he supported some experimental programs while in
the Senate but now says he opposes them. Bradley's ``view is
vouchers are not the answer, but if they improve public education,
we'd be foolish to write something off that could help kids,''
Bradley campaign spokesman Eric Hauser said.
</P>
<P>
   There also is the switch on ethanol, to which Hauser readily
pleads ``guilty.'' But Hauser said that in running for president,
Bradley adopted a broader view because he saw that the subsidy
could help a state whose farm economy was in bad shape. Hauser also
said the benefits of the subsidy were no longer going to just a
single company, as they had previously.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians such as Bradley and Gore often are susceptible to
flip-flops because they have such long track records.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an accident that we rarely elect presidents from
Congress,'' said Will Marshall, president of the Progressive Policy
Institute, a centrist Democratic think tank. ``Members of Congress
are forced to take thousands of votes on myriad issues....A lot of
times, the meaning of them is misrepresented.''
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, the GOP front-runner and son of the former
president, has not been in the public eye for very long, but the
Democratic National Committee says he has made a political
about-face or two.
</P>
<P>
   They accuse him of waffling on guns by supporting a bill
requiring background checks for weapons buyers at gun shows only
after the bill died in committee in the Texas Legislature. They
also charged that he refused to revive it.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said the background check bill
affected only storefront sales of guns, not sales at shows, so it
wouldn't have had any practical effect.
</P>
<P>
   Many voters already are so cynical about politics that one more
perceived flip-flop may hardly cause a wrinkle in the political
landscape. They've come to expect it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If candidates were more open when they're accused of changing
their positions, it wouldn't feed the cynicism,'' said Wayne
Fields, an expert in political rhetoric at Washington University in
St. Louis. ``Honesty works far better.''

PARENTS REACT TO DISTRICT'S PLAN FOR SATURDAY CLASSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN HOFFMANN  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The reaction was mixed Wednesday to the
announcement that the Kansas City School District had selected more
than 2,000 students to attend Saturday classes to avoid being held
back a grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love for my son to go,'' said Latonya Thomaston, whose
fourth-grade son, Michael, was selected for the courses. ``If they
see he is behind in certain areas and they think it will help him
get his grades back up, I'm all for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomaston said she liked the fact that the district would
provide busing, because she lacked transportation. She said Michael
typically spent his Saturdays ``getting out of bed, eating
breakfast and then playing a game.'' She said he could skip a few
hours of video games if it would help him in math and reading.
</P>
<P>
   Several parents expressed similar thoughts about their children.
But others connected to the district were concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton Adams, who has a daughter at Lincoln Prep High School,
said he was not opposed to the concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``What worries me is whether they are going to change the method
of instruction so that this extra day actually benefits the kids,''
Adams said. ``Simply adding another day of sitting at a desk won't
cut it.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams said he hoped that the district would attract only
top-quality teachers for the Saturday classes and that they would
find innovative ways to teach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a challenge for them because if these kids aren't
picking it up (in class) Monday through Friday, it's not going to
be any easier on Saturday,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   District officials sent out letters to teachers on Tuesday
explaining the program and asking for instructors. Officials had
not determined how many teachers would be willing to give up free
time on Saturdays. Teachers who signed up for the duty would be
paid extra.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Morgan, president of the local teachers union, could not be
reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Besides district teachers, school officials would use
paraprofessionals and volunteers to help instruct the youths. On
Wednesday three persons phoned The Star to ask how they could
volunteer their time for the Saturday classes.
</P>
<P>
   Because district officials were still working out details of the
program, it was unclear how much support staff, such as custodians,
security officers, administrators and secretaries, might be needed.
The district will provide free lunch and transportation to all
students who take the classes.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of the program also had not been determined, but state
funding was made available by the same legislation that allowed
districts to mandate Saturday school.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Sitze, director of the Missouri Student Improvement
Program, said the idea of Saturday school was not unique to the
Kansas City district.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been a lot of districts looking at this and saying,
`We've got kids that could use this' &UR; '' Sitze said. ``A number of
them are taking advantage of the legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   The law, enacted in August, states in part that ``no public
school student shall be promoted to a higher grade level unless
that student has a reading ability at or above one grade level
below the student's grade level.'' The law also allows school
districts to require remediation for any student in danger of
failing.
</P>
<P>
   Classes are to run from 8 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. each Saturday
beginning Jan. 22. The classes will be at 11 district schools,
including Van Horn and Southeast high schools, Central and King
middle schools and Troost, Gladstone and Weeks elementaries.
Classes for elementary and middle school students run through March
25; high school students will take classes until May 20.
</P>
<P>
   Students were chosen because they were in danger of failing
their grade level and had scored low on standardized tests.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Hammock, a spokeswoman for the district, said letters had
been mailed to parents and guardians of about 2,000 elementary and
middle school students. Those students will be required to attend
the classes, which focus on math and language arts.
</P>
<P>
   That is ideal for Julia Lee Harbin, whose granddaughter, Deauna
Harbin, has been chosen to attend Saturday school. Deauna is a
fourth-grader at Knox Elementary.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wanted me to get her (extra help) for reading,'' the
grandmother said. ``She's up on Saturday (mornings) anyway. This
will help her.''
</P>
<P>
   Letters soon will go out to about 300 high school students
selected by the district. The high school students are not required
to attend the Saturday classes but will receive one-half credit if
they do. An African-American history class, necessary to graduate
from the district, will be offered to seniors who attend, along
with math and language arts instruction.

VIOLENCE NOT ON MILITIA'S Y2K LIST
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DENNIS WAGNER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Steve Porak, a Phoenix patriot, doesn't mind sharing his plan
for New Year's Eve:
</P>
<P>
   ``At 10 o'clock, I'm going to be in bed, sleeping,'' Porak said.
``If something's going to happen, it'll be there when I wake up in
the morning. . . . Y2K is a bunch of baloney.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Porak says, those who fear terrorism from militias
don't understand the U.S. Constitution or the people who zealously
defend it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The militias' goal is to preserve the union of the 50 states.
The militia are you and me.''
</P>
<P>
   That argument echoes the stand ard line from constitutionalist
out fits sprinkled across the nation, including Arizona:
</P>
<P>
   If you're worried about mayhem on New Year's Eve, don't worry
about them.
</P>
<P>
   They disavow Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh as well as an
Arizona Patriots unit that plotted similar attacks here 13 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   They claim the federal govern ment framed 12 Team Viper militia
members who allegedly plotted a terror campaign in Arizona in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   They know nothing of the 1996 sabotage of an Amtrak passenger
train west of Phoenix by some group calling itself ``Sons of the
Gestapo.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that militia members pretend to be passive. They defy the
Internal Revenue Service, defend the right to bear arms and decry
anything re sembling a New World Order.
</P>
<P>
   But, mostly, they keep to them selves _ shunning publicity as
they spread their dogma across the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Lieberman, chairman of the Anti-Defamation League in Ari
zona, said many militias are truly patriotic, but their membership
is infiltrated by violent racists.
</P>
<P>
   Because the ADL is ``a typical target of those groups,''
Lieberman added, staff members are on alert through New Year's Eve,
and Jewish synagogues have been advised to beware.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the national ADL just released a newsletter, Y2K
Paranoia, about extremist fears and plans for marking the
millennium. The report describes apocalyptic fears and Ar
mageddonlike fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope, certainly, that nothing happens,'' Lieberman said.
``We're taking precautions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Southern Poverty Law Cen ter, a non-profit organization that
tracks anti-government groups, lists 171 militias nationwide among
435 active patriot organizations. A dozen were identified in
Arizona, going by names such as Unorganized Militia of Arizona and
First Mounted Rangers. But experts point out that other groups
operate clandestinely.
</P>
<P>
   FBI spokeswoman Susan Her skovits, asked about Y2K terrorist
concerns, said there is no informa tion she can share with the
public. Earlier this year, FBI special agent in charge, Guadalupe
Gonzales, noted that Arizona has more anti-government groups than
other states, but law enforcement cannot investigate them unless
there is a threat of violence.
</P>
<P>
   Patriot outfits are diverse and disjointed. Many subscribe to
the motto on an Arizona Viper Reserves Web page: ``Never initiate
force, nor tolerate tyranny.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, such groups may see tyranny where others do
not.
</P>
<P>
   That's apparent on the Internet. Lieberman said the ADL keeps
tabs on 800 far-right Web sites, many of which mix elaborate
conspiracy theories with anti-Semitism, herbal health tips,
survivalist guides, gun sales and get-rich-quick schemes.
</P>
<P>
   William Cooper, a shortwave ra dio broadcaster from Eagar,
touted his non-violence even while threat ening bloodshed against
federal agents if they tried to arrest him on indictments for tax
evasion and bank fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Jack McLamb, a former Phoenix sergeant who founded Police
Against the New World Order, consistently downplays violence as as
he encourages sovereign citizens to organize and arm themselves
against the ``globalists.''
</P>
<P>
   And, although Porak and others insist that Timothy McVeigh was
not part of the militia movement, there is contrary evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Long before he killed 168 people and wounded hundreds more in
Oklahoma City, McVeigh was a fan of Cooper's broadcasts _ and of
McLamb's anti-government tracts.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many insist, the media have misportrayed militia outfits
as ag gressors when their real purpose is to protect the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anybody that believes the garbage you guys are
printing,'' Porak noted.
</P>
<P>
   Michael ``Big Mike'' Stevens, a self-described ``anti-liberal''
who publishes the SHF News, said the true believers he knows will
be hunkered down until the Y2K ca lamity ends.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if militia types might launch an offensive, Stevens said,
laughing, ``Nobody in their right mind. They aren't the ones who
will go out and start (stuff).'' &QL;

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Sauteed mushrooms and apricot chutney were
among the scents emanating from the Kansas City Community Kitchen
on Wednesday as culinary students busily prepared for their
graduation meal Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The five students are the first graduates of Culinary
Cornerstones, a free, 12-week career development program aimed at
the unemployed, the underemployed and the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   The students enrolled this session are either living with
relatives or in transitional housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted a program that would feed the total person _ mind,
body and soul,'' said Jane Tally, executive director, ``and the
outcome was this training program.''
</P>
<P>
   The curriculum is similar to that of a traditional culinary
school and is the only career development program endorsed by the
Greater Kansas City Restaurant Association.
</P>
<P>
   The training is intensive, said Mike Osadchey, a student who has
landed a job with a major restaurant chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The program was excellent and covered a lot of ground in short
amount of time. Now we are ready to be employed because we all
understand the basics and have the necessary techniques,'' Osadchey
said.
</P>
<P>
   Students learned to prepare fancy foods _ no burgers or fries.
The graduation menu consisted of bourbon roast turkey, roast leg of
venison and fried shrimp diaoble.
</P>
<P>
   All the graduating students already have jobs lined up and have
received certification from the National Restaurant Association as
well as a licensed nutritionist.
</P>
<P>
   One of the students, Ricky Lewis, will start work at Bishop
Spencer Place, a retirement community, on Wednesday. Lewis said the
program helped get his life back on track.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family had a restaurant, and I had already been a cook,''
Lewis said while slicing mushrooms for a chicken strudel. ``But the
restaurant went under and I had some personal health problems and
other trials and tribulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was here eating one day and saw a notice about this program
and decided to check it out. I am glad I did, because I was feeling
down, and this program inspired me.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides learning culinary skills, the students are taught life
skills, said Bob Brassard, program director and a certified
executive chef.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting a job is not good enough,'' Brassard said. ``The
students need to have a balance in their professional and private
lives. We teach them stress management, time management and how to
deal with conflicts. The first 12 weeks of their new jobs will be
like an internship period, and we will also mentor the students for
two years after graduation.''
</P>
<P>
   While in the program, the students receive a $25 per week
stipend and tokens for transportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we ask is for them to be drug- and alcohol-free and come
to class every day,'' Brassard said. ``And we do conduct random
drug and alcohol tests during the program. Their payment to us is
their daily effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Culinary Cornerstones is supported through community donations
and operates out of the Community Kitchen at 415 W. 13th St.
</P>
<P>
   The next class starts early next month and 15 students will be
enrolled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope these students are the first of many to follow,''
Brassard said of Thursday's graduating class, ``and that they will
be mentors to future students.''
