<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton Takes to the Stage  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- After more than seven years of enduring
barbs as first lady, Senate candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton got
her chance Saturday night to offer up zingers of her own as she
took the stage -- with a carpet bag in hand -- at the nation's oldest
continuous political gridiron show.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just like every other New Yorker with Secret Service
protection,'' said the first lady, who moved into New York in
January.
</P>
<P>
   She noted she was already on her second opponent, and provided
the audience of 500 at the 100th annual Legislative Correspondents
Association dinner in Albany with a slide show of home photos -- all
of them showing her wearing a New York Yankees' hat.
</P>
<P>
   She was even wearing the hat, thanks to a digital enhancement,
during her husband's first inaugural walk down Pennsylvania Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's Republican opponent in the Senate race, Rep. Rick
Lazio, attended the show as well, but declined an invitation to
speak. Aides said Lazio's late entry into the race, after New York
City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani quit the campaign last month to deal
with prostate cancer, had left them with too little time to prepare
for the appearance.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. John Sweeney, a former top aide to Gov. George Pataki,
delivered the Republican response at the conclusion of the show.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney showed a video takeoff on the hit movie ''The
Gladiator,'' in which Clinton was ''Statelessius'' in a fight
against ''Split Lipitus.'' In Sweeney's video, the gladiator with
the split lip -- a reference to Lazio's fall in a recent parade that
left him with a fat lip -- won the battle.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Lazio shook hands before the show began but spoke
only briefly and sat at opposite sides of the front table.
</P>
<P>
   The $200-a-person black-tie gala raises money for charity and
attracts the movers and shakers of New York politics and
government.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady's turn on the stage came only after reporters who
write about state government had a chance to skewer her and other
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Karen DeWitt of the New York Public Radio Network portrayed
Clinton in a musical skit, singing to the tune of ''Can't Take My
Mind Off of You'':
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just too crass to be true, even said I was a Jew.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll do whatever it takes,
</P>
<P>
   ''Cause my self-worth is at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   The LCA show was held at the Empire State Plaza Convention
Center adjacent to the state Capitol.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton takes stage at political satire show  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - After more than seven years of enduring
barbs as first lady, Senate candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton got
her chance Saturday night to offer up zingers of her own as she
appeared at the nation's oldest continuous political gridiron show,
taking the stage with a carpetbag in hand.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just like every other New Yorker with Secret Service
protection,'' the first lady, who moved into New York in January,
told the audience of more than 500 people.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that she was already on ''my second opponent,'' Clinton
provided the audience with a slide show of home photos titled ''The
Woman from Chappaqua,'' a play on her husband's 1992 presidential
campaign video ''The Man from Hope.'' The first lady's photos,
including one of her as a child and another of her as an adult
meeting the Pope, showed her wearing a New York Yankees' hat.
</P>
<P>
   ''He really liked my hat,'' the first lady said of the Pope's
reaction.
</P>
<P>
   She was even wearing the hat, thanks to a digital enhancement,
during her husband's first inaugural walk down Pennsylvania Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady came under fire early in the campaign when she
claimed she had always rooted for the Yankees in the American
League, even while her main allegiance was to the National League's
Chicago Cubs. She grew up in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was and someday will be permitted to be a Yankees fan,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was one of the guest speakers at the 100th annual
Legislative Correspondents Association dinner and show in Albany.
She is seeking the Senate seat being vacated this year by fellow
Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's Republican opponent, Rep. Rick Lazio of Long Island,
attended the show as well, but declined an invitation to speak.
Aides said Lazio's late entry into the race, after New York City
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani quit the campaign last month to deal with
prostate cancer, had left them with too little time to prepare for
the appearance.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. John Sweeney, a former top aide to Gov. George Pataki,
delivered the Republican response at the conclusion of the show.
Sweeney showed a video takeoff on the hit movie ''The Gladiator,''
in which Clinton was ''Statelessius'' in a fight against ''Split
Lipitus.'' In Sweeney's video, the gladiator with the split lip - a
reference to Lazio's fall in a recent parade that left him with a
fat lip - won the battle.
</P>
<P>
   Seated at the head table, Clinton and Lazio shook hands before
the show began. They spoke only briefly and sat at opposite sides
of the round table for 10.
</P>
<P>
   The $200-a-person black-tie gala raises money for charity and
attracts the movers and shakers of New York politics and
government. Among others, the crowd for Saturday night's event
included Pataki and state Comptroller H. Carl McCall, a potential
Democratic candidate for governor in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   After five years of being a guest speaker at the LCA show,
Pataki decided not to speak at this year's event.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady's turn on the stage came only after reporters
covering the state government had a chance to skewer her and other
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   The role of Hillary Clinton was played in Saturday night's show
by Karen DeWitt of the New York Public Radio Network. Clinton, who
laughed at most of the acts, didn't seem as amused when DeWitt
sang, to the tune of ''Can't Take My Mind Off of You'':
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just too crass to be true, even said I was a Jew.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll do whatever it takes,
</P>
<P>
   ''Cause my self-worth is at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   At intermission, the first lady went backstage and shook hands
with cast members. When she met DeWitt, Clinton smiled and said,
''Nice job.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore's claim that he was out of the room
during a key White House discussion of questionable fund-raising
plans because he had consumed too much ice tea and had to use the
restroom was also grist for the reporters' mill. Erik Kriss of the
Syracuse Herald-Journal/Post Standard played the role of the vice
president and sang to the tune of Kenny Rodgers' ''The Gambler:''
</P>
<P>
   ''You got to know when to wee-wee when you're the VP.
</P>
<P>
   ''Know when to leave the room and run out to the can.
</P>
<P>
   ''When subpoenas start a fallin', just tell 'em nature's callin'
</P>
<P>
   ''That's why you don't know the first thing 'bout the crooked
plans.''
</P>
<P>
   The LCA show was held at the Empire State Plaza Convention
Center adjacent to the state Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislative Correspondents Alumni Association's Walter T.
Brown award for excellence in reporting over the past year went to

<HEADLINE> Royals 2, Pirates 1, 12 Innings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Mac Suzuki came within one out of his
first career shutout before Mike Sweeney won it for Kansas City
with an RBI single in the 12th inning as the Royals beat the
Pittsburgh Pirates 2-1 on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Damon hit an infield single off Jose Silva (4-2) to lead off the
12th for Kansas City. After a sacrifice bunt by Luis Ordaz, Sweeney
singled to center to give Kansas City its 10th walk-off win.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Bottalico (5-1) pitched two scoreless innings to get the
win.
</P>
<P>
   Suzuki, making his ninth career start, allowed one run and nine
hits in 8 2-3 innings. He retired the first two men in the ninth
before Kevin Young singled, stole second and scored on Adrian
Brown's single to center. Suzuki struck out seven and walked one.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Morris had a career high five hits for Pittsburgh, which
stranded 13 runners. Kansas City left 12 on base.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals scored in the fourth inning when Jermaine Dye drew a
one-out walk off Kris Benson and advanced to second on Carlos
Beltran's groundout. Joe Randa followed with an RBI single to left.
</P>
<P>
   Suzuki kept the Pirates off-balance all night, allowing only one
runner in the first eight inning to advance as far as third base.
Young singled with one out in the second, stole second and advanced
to third on a throwing error by catcher Gregg Zaun.
</P>
<P>
   But Suzuki struck out Adrian Brown and Mike Benjamin to end that
threat.
</P>
<P>
   Benson retired the first eight batters he faced before Rey
Sanchez drilled a single to center. Benson retired the Royals in
order in the first, second and fifth innings. He allowed only five
hits in eight innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Dave McCarty went 0-for-5 for Kansas City, snapping his
12-game hitting streak. ... The Royals are 19-7 at home, the best
home record in the American League. ... Kevin Young became the
first Pirates player to steal two bases in a game. ... Neither team
had an extra-base hit. The Pirates had at least one in their first
58 games.

<HEADLINE> Brussels Police, Soccer Fans Clash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Police in riot gear fired tear gas
Sunday to disperse thousands of rowdy soccer fans in the center of
Brussels, hours after Belgium beat Sweden 2-1 in the opening match
of the Euro 2000 soccer championship.
</P>
<P>
   Streets around the Grand' Place, the Neo-classic central square,
were cordoned off late Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   What began as a celebration by flag-waving, singing soccer fans
turned nasty when bottles and glasses were thrown at police who
responded with charges and volleys of tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of soccer fans filled the center of town after the
Belgium-Sweden match in the King Baudouin Stadium on the northern
outskirts of Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   Police fired tear gas to disperse crowds that tried to break
through police lines to reach the Grand' Place.
</P>
<P>
   The downtown clashes were in sharp contrast to the order that
was maintained around the stadium before and during the match that
was attended by the royal families of Belgium and the Netherlands,
co-hosts of the Euro 2000 event.
</P>
<P>
   Before the match, two dozen people were taken into custody in
various places across Belgium on charges of scalping tickets
outside the stadium, police said.
</P>
<P>
   They included four Germans who were detained as they entered
Belgium with 107 tickets for several Euro 2000 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Belgium-Sweden match marked the start of the 16-team soccer
tournament in a game played before King Albert of Belgium and Queen
Beatrix of the Netherlands and a crowd of 50,000 at King Baudouin
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Belgians, sharing the role of tournament host with the
Netherlands, were backed by goals Bart Goor and Emile Mpenza and
survived a blunder by goalkeeper Filip de Wilde in the day's only
game.
</P>
<P>
   Goor scored two minutes before halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Seconds after halftime, Emile Mpenza took a pass from Branko
Strupar and struck with a shot high into the net. The goal meant
that within four minutes on the clock, Sweden yielded more goals
than during its entire qualifying campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament, which ends July 2 in Rotterdam, will be played
amid unprecedented police numbers, with English, German and Dutch
fans targeted by authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Border police on Saturday stopped two dozen known and suspected
English hooligans from traveling to Belgium and the Netherlands.
Three drunken fans arriving from England also were sent back.
</P>
<P>
   In all, some two dozen Englishmen, either convicted for hooligan
violence or suspected of spawning such violence were kept in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, three games were scheduled: World Cup champion France
against Denmark; the Netherlands, the title favorite, against the
Czech Republic, the runner-up in the last Euros in 1996; and Italy
against Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion Germany does not play until Monday when it
meets Romania.

<HEADLINE> Comets 73, Starzz 71  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Guard Janeth Arcain picked up a wayward
rebound and sank a 16-foot jumper with one second to play, lifting
the Houston Comets to a 73-71 WNBA victory over the Utah Starzz on
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Utah tied the game with nine seconds to play as rookie point
guard Stacy Frese swished a 3-pointer. But after a Houston timeout,
Arcain converted Cynthia Cooper's missed driving layup into a
game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   Sheryl Swoopes led Houston (6-1) with 22 points, nearly three
shy of her 24.8-point average, second-highest in the league. Tina
Thompson added 18 points and four blocks, while holding Olympian
Natalie Williams in check.
</P>
<P>
   Williams led Utah with 17 points and nine rebounds, but scored
just 13 while playing against Thompson. Adrienne Goodson added 15
points for the Starzz.
</P>
<P>
   Utah (3-3) is 1-12 against the Comets in four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Utah held a 35-26 rebounding advantage and rallied from a
12-point first-half deficit to go up 64-58 in the second half, when
there were six lead changes. But the Starzz's 18 turnovers, six by
Williams led to 15 Comets points.
</P>
<P>
   The teams meet again Monday night in Houston.

   DALLAS (AP) -- The Devils' Jason Arnott ripped a shot from the left circle
past Dallas goaltender Ed Belfour 8:20 into the second overtime, ending a second
consecutive tension-filled overtime game -- and the Dallas Stars' Stanley Cup
run -- with a 2-1 New Jersy victory Saturday night. Arnott one-timed Patrik

   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -- Within hours after the death of President Hafez Assad
Saturday, Syria's parliament overwhelmingly voted to amend an article in the
constitution that requires the head of state to be at least 40 years old,
clearing the way for Assad's son, Bashar, to assume the presidency. The
legislators voted to lower the age to 34. Bashar is 34. Then parliament
adjourned until June 25. Assad had been grooming Bashar for future leadership,
but the British-educated ophthalmologist has held no major political office.

said in a news release. No further details were released. The three-day summit

   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Despite the departure of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani from the
closely watched U.S. Senate race in New York, Hillary Rodham Clinton has been
unable to open up a gap over the Republican opposition, according to three
independent polls. When Giuliani pulled out of the race on May 19, Republican
leaders predicted that by late summer or early fall their new candidate, Rep.
Rick Lazio, would be running even with the first lady. But on June 7, the
Quinnipiac University Polling Institute came out with its offering. It showed
Clinton and Lazio tied, at 44 percent each.

<HEADLINE> Dodgers 7, Athletics 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Eric Karros tied the Los Angeles career home
run record and Shawn Green also homered as the Los Angeles Dodgers
beat the Oakland Athletics 7-2 on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Brown (5-2) recorded his third complete game of the season
with a seven-hitter, including Jason Giambi's RBI single in the
sixth inning and Eric Chavez's solo homer in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander, who has not allowed more than three earned
runs in any of his 12 outings this year, went the distance for the
eighth time in 47 starts with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Karros's sixth-inning, solo homer was his 17th of the season and
228th of his career, tying Ron Cey's record for Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Karros, who has spent his entire career with the Dodgers, drove
a 1-1 pitch from reliever Scott Service into the lower seats in the
left-field corner to make it 7-1.
</P>
<P>
   Omar Olivares (3-8) allowed three runs in the first inning and
lost his fifth straight start. Olivares, tied for the most losses
in the majors, allowed six runs and nine hits in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   F.P. Santangelo led off the first with a single, Mark
Grudzielanek doubled inside first base and Gary Sheffield scored
both runners with a double off the fence in right-center. Green
then looped a broken-bat RBI double inside the left-field line.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers made it 4-0 in the third on a two-out walk to Chad
Kreuter and singles by Alex Cora and Brown, who leads Dodgers
pitchers with three RBIs in 24 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Olivares walked Sheffield with one out in the fourth before
surrendering Green's 11th homer, a towering drive to right-center
that made it 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland was the only American League team Green did not homer
against last season, when he hit a career-high 42 for Toronto.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Karros needed 4,669 career at-bats to reach 228 homers, 547
fewer than Cey. ... Including Olivares' third-inning single,
Oakland pitchers are 4-for-51 at the plate since interleague play
began in 1997. ... Giambi was hit by a pitch in the first inning,
he became the first batter plunked by Brown this season and the
37th by Dodger pitchers -- the most in the majors.

<HEADLINE> Jason Arnott Wins Cup for Friend  </HEADLINE>
By TOM CANAVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Jason Arnott and Patrik Elias didn't just combine
to win the Stanley Cup for the New Jersey Devils. They did it also
for their fallen linemate, Petr Sykora.
</P>
<P>
   Arnott took a pass from Elias and snapped a shot past Ed Belfour
at 8:20 of the second overtime on Saturday night to give the Devils
a 2-1 win over the Dallas Stars and their second Cup since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Having the two combine for the game winner was so appropriate
because Sykora wasn't there to see it.
</P>
<P>
   With 7:52 left in the first period, Sykora was crunched by
Dallas defenseman Derian Hatcher after flipping a shot at Belfour,
and he fell back to the ice on his back, his hands held out as if
frozen.
</P>
<P>
   Trainers and doctors immediately came out to attend him as
players from both teams watched with concern.
</P>
<P>
   Sykora was taken off the ice on a stretcher and taken to Baylor
University Medical Center where a CT scan was negative. Sykora was
held overnight for observation.
</P>
<P>
   While he was being treated, the Devils went about the job of
trying to wrest the Cup from the defending champions.
</P>
<P>
   Arnott and Elias, who played with a variety of wings for the
rest of the game, had a couple of chances to break the 1-1 tie, but
the end came on somewhat on a broken play.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Stevens, the Conn Smythe Trophy winner as the MVP of the
playoffs, sent the puck into the right corner. Elias retrieved it
and sent a blind backhand pass across the goalmouth, a play the
line has used all year.
</P>
<P>
   The puck went right in front of Belfour and found Arnott all
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Arnott, who had been run out of Edmonton because of poor play
and acquired by the Devils in January 1998, didn't hesitate to pop
it past a defenseless Belfour, who was phenomenal the final two
games of the series.
</P>
<P>
   As the Cup was handed to the Devils, Elias had Sykora's jersey
draped over his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   The goal capped a great playoffs for Arnott, who emerged as a
budding star in the postseason. He and Elias led the Devils in
scoring with 20 points apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Arnott had eight goals and 12 assists while Elias had seven
goals and 13 assists. Sykora, a resident of the Czech Republic like
Elias, had nine goals and eight assists.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night, they shared something else besides
friendship: a Stanley Cup, the first for each.

<HEADLINE> Padres 13, Astros 3  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Bret Boone hit a grand slam and tied his career
high with six RBIs, and Ruben Rivera also homered as the San Diego
Padres beat the Houston Astros 13-3 on Saturday night to snap their
five-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   A night after beating the Padres 7-6, the Astros reverted to the
form they've shown in dropping to the worst record in the majors
(22-39). Starter Scott Elarton allowed nine runs in 1 1-3 innings,
the shortest outing of his career, and the Astros issued three
bases-loaded walks.
</P>
<P>
   Things got so bad for Houston that infielder Tim Bogar pitched
the eighth inning -- and he was the only Astros pitcher to record a
1-2-3 inning. Bogar, making his first major league appearance,
pitched four times in the minors.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera and Phil Nevin each drove in three runs, and Eric Owens
matched his career-high with four hits, all singles. The 13 runs
matched the Padres' season-high, set April 16 against the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   Boone hit his second career slam to right-center field on a 3-2
pitch from Elarton (4-2) to highlight the five-run first. His
eighth homer of the season came after Elarton walked Rivera with
the bases loaded to force in the first run.
</P>
<P>
   Boone also came up with the bases loaded with one out in the
second inning. Houston manager Larry Dierker replaced Elarton with
Joe Slusarski, and Boone greeted the reliever by hitting his first
pitch for a two-run single and a 9-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Boone's other career grand slam came on April 12, 1998, at
Colorado when he was with Cincinnati. He set his RBI career-high on
Sept. 20 that season at Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Owens also had four hits against Houston on April 16.
</P>
<P>
   Given a 2-0 lead on Craig Biggio's homer, Elarton wasted little
time in giving it back. Owens singled leading off the Padres' first
and Al Martin doubled. With one out, Elarton walked Phil Nevin on
four pitches to load the bases and then walked Rivera on four more
to force in the first run before Boone came to bat.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera hit a two-run homer off Slusarski in the fourth, his
fifth. Nevin hit a two-run double in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Meadows (5-5) won for the first time in five starts. He
allowed two runs on nine hits, struck out two and walked two in six
innings. Elarton allowed six hits, walked four struck out two and
saw his ERA climb from 6.52 to 7.94.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Biggio's homer was his third. ... Martin was ejected by
umpire Ted Barrett for arguing a called third strike in the second
inning. A replay appeared to show that Elarton's pitch was just
outside. ... Dave Winfield, who will be inducted into the Padres'
Hall of Fame on Aug. 19, took batting practice before the game. He
joined the Padres straight from college in 1973 and played with
them for eight seasons before signing as a free agent with the New
York Yankees. ... After being used as DH for a six-game trip to
Seattle and Oakland, Tony Gwynn is back to his schedule of one game
on, one game off to rest his degenerative left knee. ... Astros C
Mitch Meluskey threw out Eric Owens trying to steal second in the
third inning, just the fifth runner he's caught in 36 attempts.

<HEADLINE> Devils 2, Stars 1, 2OT  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN ROBINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- The New Jersey Devils finally won the Stanley Cup
-- even if they were almost too tired to lift it once they did.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Arnott ripped a shot from the left circle past Dallas
goaltender Ed Belfour 8:20 into the second overtime, ending a
second consecutive tension-filled overtime game -- and the Stars'
Stanley Cup run -- with a 2-1 Devils victory Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Arnott one-timed Patrik Elias' shot past Belfour as the Devils
prevented the Stars from forcing a Game 7 Monday in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Devils wouldn't lose on the road to Dallas -- they
were 3-0 in Reunion Arena -- the Stanley Cup has a new home. The
Stars, who won the Cup on the road in Game 6 last year in Buffalo,
lost it in Game 6 at home.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third time in five years the Cup was won in overtime,
and the fourth time in five years the Cup has been won on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Devils goaltender Martin Brodeur ended his seven-game overtime
playoff losing streak by making 30 saves, while Belfour -- one of
the heroes of the Stars' 1-0, three-overtime victory in Game 5 --
lost despite stopping 43 of 45 shots.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an unbelievable feeling,'' said Brodeur, who had been
1-5 in multiple-overtime games. ''This time around I think I
realized it a little more.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time in the best-of-seven era there have been
back-to-back multiple overtime games in the finals.
</P>
<P>
   Devils defenseman Scott Stevens was named the Conn Smythe Award
winner as the playoffs MVP.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Stars never gave up, you have to give them credit. They
fought and fought,'' Stevens said. ''I was telling everyone to play
hard for me. You don't get too many chances, so I'm just enjoying
this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' fans were clearly distraught at seeing the Cup won on
their ice, but most stayed to cheer the post-game presentation to
Stevens by NHL commissioner Gary Bettman.
</P>
<P>
   ''The games we had here were really tough,'' Stars center Mike
Modano said. ''They're a great team, outstanding. Those guys --
Brodeur, (Scott) Gomez, Arnott -- I know how they're feeling. It's a
great feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Many fans began cheering, ''Stan-ley Cup,'' and ''Stan-ley Cup''
and ''Ed-die, Ed-die'' in appreciation not only of two of the most
stirring overtime games in recent Cup history, but the excellent
goaltending.
</P>
<P>
   It was the end of one era for the Devils -- John McMullen's
18-year run as owner -- and, likely, the start of another. Larry
Robinson became only the third coach to win a Stanley Cup after
taking over during the season and, by succeeding Robbie Ftorek with
only eight games left, became the latest to take over a Cup
champion.
</P>
<P>
   It was Robinson's eighth Stanley Cup title, six as a player and
two as a coach, one as an assistant.
</P>
<P>
   ''Marty played unbelievable, really throughout the whole
series,'' Robinson said. ''Scottie's been a tower of strength. He's
got that 'C' for a reason. This is not about me. I'm happy for
those guys out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devils opened a 3-1 series lead, then nearly lost it in
overtime -- first in the tense goalie duel in Game 5, then in yet
another multiple overtime in Game 6 -- before avoiding a Game 7.
Only one team in NHL history, Detroit in 1942, has lost the finals
after leading 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   As might be expected, the Devils won it on the road. They are
5-0 all-time in road Stanley Cup finals games, winning all three in
Reunion Arena, where the Stars had won 11 of their last 12 playoff
games before the finals.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils matched their own 1995 record with 10 road victories
in a single playoff year. They were 10-2 on the road this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars became the first defending champion to lose in the
finals since the New York Islanders in 1984. The last four
defending champs to reach the finals all won. The Devils are the
first Eastern Conference team to win the cup since they last did so
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams started the first overtime with a rush. Sergei Brylin
had an open shot within 90 seconds for New Jersey, but the puck hit
off the heel of his stick. A short time later, the Stars' Joe
Nieuwendyk, last year's playoffs MVP, used a spin move to get open
in the slot, only to miss wide on an unguarded shot.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas had a rare overtime power play -- referees traditionally
call only the most blatant violations in overtime -- when Arnott
cross-checked Blake Sloan to the jaw while pinning him to the ice
at 18:43. Despite having several good scoring chances during the
power play, the Stars were credited with one shot on goal to New
Jersey's 11 in the first overtime.
</P>
<P>
   One goal was enough for the Stars to win the three-overtime Game
5, but a one-goal lead didn't last two minutes for New Jersey this
time.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Niedermayer ended the Devils' 145-minute, 33-second
scoreless streak against Belfour on a 3-on-1 break at 5:18, the
Devils' second short-handed goal in as many games in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Claude Lemieux started the play by blocking Sylvain Cote at the
blue line, then took Jay Pandolfo's pass to set up Niedermayer, who
played junior hockey for Stars coach Ken Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's first lead since the third period of Game 4 lasted
only 1:09 before Mike Keane tied it with only the fourth goal in
four games for Dallas. Mike Modano made a drop pass to Scott
Thornton, who threaded the puck across the ice for Keane's high
wrister from the right circle that sailed past Brodeur at 6:27.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams had a flurry of chances later in the period. The
Devils' Colin White hit the post and Elias struck the crossbar, and
Brodeur stopped Modano's short-range shot from the left circle.
</P>
<P>
   By midway through the first period -- easily, the most physical
and rambunctious of the series -- it appeared the team hoisting the
cup would be the one with enough players left to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Each team lost a key player: defenseman Darryl Sydor for Dallas
and first-line forward Petr Sykora for New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Sykora was taken to a hospital on a stretcher for examination
following a high-speed neutral zone collision with the Stars'
Derian Hatcher at 12:08. Tests proved negative, but Sykora was to
stay overnight for observation.
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher appeared to hit Sykora with his elbow up, but no penalty
was called.
</P>
<P>
   Sydor, moved up to the first line in Game 5 in a strategical
ploy by Hitchcock, injured his left leg while colliding with the
Devils' Scott Gomez with 3:20 gone.
</P>
<P>
   Sydor's leg became tangled with Gomez as he tried to spin off a
check, causing Sydor to slam into the boards unprotected.
</P>
<P>
   The physical play increased significantly after that. Arnott
hooked his stick under Nieuwendyk's left leg to upend him
immediately after a faceoff, but Nieuwendyk wasn't hurt despite
slamming into the ice back first.

<HEADLINE> NJ fans erupt as Devils win 2nd Stanley Cup  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   After enduring five grueling overtimes in two
straight games,
New Jersey Devils fans went wild Saturday night when the Devils
beat the Dallas Stars, 2-1, to wrest the Stanley Cup from the
defending champions.
<TEXT>
<P>
   New Jersey won the best-of-seven series, 4-2. Game 6 was made
necessary when Dallas beat the Devils 1-0 in triple overtime
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh my God. Oh boy. Did you see that play?'' asked Dave
Belford, 32, of Toms River, who watched the game at Klee's bar in
Seaside Heights. ''It's about time. I couldn't take another third
overtime.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Marino, 24, of Lodi, wedged into the Grasshopper bar in
Carlstadt near the Devils' home ice at the Meadowlands, along with
about 150 other die-hard fans.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm all emotional,'' he said. ''I tell myself I wasn't going
to cry and I cried. I was pulling my hair out the whole game. I'm
ecstatic.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans erupted when Jason Arnott scored a goal in the second
overtime, hugging each other, screaming, chanting and jumping up
and down.
</P>
<P>
   Marino brought his own Stanley Cup replica to the bar, made out
of a bucket and aluminum foil. He ate chicken wings from it during
the game.
</P>
<P>
   A waiter at a Paramus restaurant, he managed to get Saturday
night off to watch the game.
</P>
<P>
   Veronica Crawford, 44, of Newton, watched the championship at
the Grasshopper with her husband and three children.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been a very long week - a lot of late nights. And I have
to get up at 4:30 and go to work,'' said Crawford, a nurse at Saint
Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston. ''I could have a very long
day tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   But, she said, watching their favorite team was more important
than sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's fabulous. This is terrific. This is such an exciting
night,'' said the season ticket-holder.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second Stanley Cup victory for the Devils, the first
coming in 1995 against the Detroit Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
   After the Devils won their first cup, more than 25,000 fans -
many in red and green body paint, horns, capes and pointed tails -
flooded the Meadowlands Arena parking lot for a victory celebration
several days later.
</P>
<P>
   There was no word early Sunday on plans for a celebration in New
Jersey.

<HEADLINE> Rapids 1, Galaxy 0  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Junior Agogo's goal in sudden-death overtime gave
the Colorado Rapids a 1-0 victory Saturday over the Los Angeles
Galaxy at Mile High Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   After a scoreless 94 minutes, Agogo capitalized on a turnover by
Galaxy defender Paul Caligiuri in his own box. Agogo collected
Caligiuri's errant clearance and fired a shot that deflected off
defender Robin Fraser and past Galaxy goalkeeper Kevin Hartman.
</P>
<P>
   The goal for Agogo was his team-leading seventh of the season
and his league-leading fourth game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   Rapids defender Chris Martinez held forward Luis Hernandez to
one shot on the goal. Colorado also held the Galaxy to no shots on
goal in the first half.

<HEADLINE> Report: Yankees Sign Dwight Gooden  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Yankees are giving Dwight Gooden
yet another chance.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees signed the 35-year-old right-hander to a minor
league contract, The Sunday Record of Hackensack reported.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden, released by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays two weeks ago, told
the paper he was ''totally blown away'' at the opportunity to pitch
for the Yankees again.
</P>
<P>
   ''George Steinbrenner is giving me a chance, and I'm going to
make the most of it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner gave Gooden a chance before. The right-hander
joined the Yankees in 1996 after missing the 1995 season because of
a drug suspension.
</P>
<P>
   He threw the ninth no-hitter in club history May 14, 1996,
against the Mariners. He went 20-12 with a 4.58 ERA in two seasons
with the Yankees, but left following injuries and personal
differences with manager Joe Torre.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden was 2-3 with a 6.86 ERA for Houston and Tampa Bay this
season.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees, who might have to put Ramiro Mendoza on the
disabled list, have little risk in signing Gooden because the Devil
Rays will pay the bulk of his $500,000 salary.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden will spend at least a week working at the club's minor
league complex in Tampa, Fla., and will go to Triple-A Columbus
when his arm strength is back.
</P>
<P>
   ''With everything that's happened to me this year, I'm sure
they're going to watch me pretty closely,'' Gooden told the paper.
''I want to make sure I'm ready. If anything, I'd rather be too
ready.''

<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- When the disappointment of not winning their
second straight Stanley Cup fades, the Dallas Stars will take pride
in knowing they went down fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas' title defense ended at 8:20 of a second overtime
Saturday night when Jason Arnott flipped the puck over goaltender
Ed Belfour, giving the New Jersey Devils a 2-1 victory and the
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ''We worked hard, played our best,'' Belfour said. ''We just
fell short.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars extended the finals to a sixth game with a 1-0,
triple-overtime victory in Game 5. They dragged this one out well
past regulation, too, becoming the first team facing elimination to
force consecutive overtimes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm probably more proud of my team this year than last,''
Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ''Yes, we won last year, but this
team went through so much and at the end was an eyelash away from
bringing it back for a Game 7.''
</P>
<P>
   The fans in Reunion Arena showed their appreciation, serenading
Belfour with the chant ''Ed-die! Ed-die!'' immediately after
Belfour allowed just his second goal in 208 minutes, 33 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as the Devils were about to receive the Cup, the crowd
erupted again with a cheer of ''Thank you, Stars.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not supposed to work out this way,'' said Mike Keane, who
scored Dallas' only goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars gained home-ice advantage by winning the second game
in New Jersey, then squandered it in Game 3. Dallas ended up losing
all three home games after winning 11 of its previous 12 postseason
games in Reunion.
</P>
<P>
   ''As well as we played here the first three series, then losing
three in a row -- that's really something,'' center Mike Modano
said. ''Nobody ever would've guessed that.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeing the Cup passed around on the Reunion ice wasn't easy for
the Stars, who had their celebration in Buffalo last year.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Richard Matvichuk was among the players who had tears
in his eyes as he walked off the ice. Hitchcock remained behind the
bench, stunned and saddened.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know how hard it is to win the Cup and I know how hard it is
to repeat,'' said New Jersey coach Larry Robinson, who won six as a
player and one as an assistant coach. ''They have nothing to hang
their heads about. They gave us all we could handle and more.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars were hoping a second straight title would prove them
to be more than one-year wonders. Instead, they became the first
defending champs to lose in the finals since the 1984 New York
Islanders ended their four-year run as champs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We fought back,'' said Modano, who played an extraordinary
amount of minutes to try juicing up the Dallas offense. ''It's a
great thing we accomplished here the last three years.''
</P>
<P>
   Belfour suffered a cold medicine-induced meltdown in Game 1, a
7-3 shelling in New Jersey, and he gave up three goals in a span of
3:41 in Game 4. He stopped 100 of the final 102 shots.
</P>
<P>
   The final goal came on a pass from the corner to Arnott on the
left side of the crease. Belfour blocked the bottom of the net and
Arnott popped it into the top.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a bang-bang play,'' said Belfour, whose performance all
season and postseason was the main reason why Dallas made it this
far. ''Any time you give up a chance in the slot like that, it's
going to be a big save or a big goal.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second period, he allowed a shorthanded goal to Scott
Niedermayer, but the Devils' lead only lasted 69 seconds as Keane
tied the game with a hard shot over the glove of New Jersey goalie
Martin Brodeur.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas failed on four power plays in the game, including one
caused by Arnott with 1:17 left in the first overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Nieuwendyk had two good scoring chances in the first
overtime, but one went wide left and another was blocked before it
got to Brodeur. The Stars technically had just two shots in the
overtimes, but there were more scoring chances.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it isn't one team that beats you went you're defending
champs,'' Hitchcock said. ''It's the cumulative effect of teams
getting up for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Both teams lost key players to first-period injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas defenseman Darryl Sydor went down first with a leg injury
that kept him from standing up; instead, he kept after the play by
crawling across the ice. He was helped off and didn't return.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said Sydor suffered a high ankle sprain and would need
six to eight weeks to rehabilitate.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey forward Petr Sykora had to be taken a hospital after
taking a blow to the head from Stars captain Derian Hatcher.
Although a CT scan showed Sykora was OK, he spent the night at
Baylor University Medical Center for observation.

<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- The Devils' Jason Arnott ripped a shot from the left circle
past Dallas goaltender Ed Belfour 8:20 into the second overtime, ending a second
consecutive tension-filled overtime game -- and the Dallas Stars' Stanley Cup
run -- with a 2-1 New Jersy victory Saturday night. Arnott one-timed Patrik
Elias' shot past Belfour as the Devils prevented the Stars from forcing a Game 7
Monday in New Jersey.

   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- The first-ever meeting between South Korean

said in a news release. No further details were released. The three-day summit

<HEADLINE> NJ's Sykora, Stars' Sydor Injured  </HEADLINE>
By JAIME ARON
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- New Jersey's Petr Sykora was hospitalized for
observation Saturday night after taking a blow to the head from
Dallas Stars captain Derian Hatcher in the first period of Game 6
of the Stanley Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   A CT scan was normal and Sykora, whose head was immobilized for
fear of a back or neck injury, had a full range of motion, said
team spokesman Kevin Dessart.
</P>
<P>
   Play was stopped with 7:52 remaining and Sykora was told to stay
flat on his back. Trainers cautiously placed him on a stretcher and
took him to Baylor University Medical Center to spend the night.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils won the Stanley Cup 2-1 in double overtime on a goal
by Sykora's linemate, Jason Arnott, with assists by Patrik Elias
and Scott Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   During the Stanley Cup ceremony, Elias draped Sykora's No. 17 on
his shoulders. He said he called Sykora at the hospital and told
him the team would bring him the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said that when we scored, he was jumping out of the bed,''
Elias said.
</P>
<P>
   Sykora had just crossed the blue line into the Dallas zone with
the puck when Hatcher, who two games ago knocked the bridge from
Arnott's mouth, skated into him. He dropped immediately and
appeared to be dazed, although he was speaking later to trainers as
concerned players from both teams gathered around him. No penalty
was called.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am not sure what happened,'' Hatcher said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third time the game had to be stopped because a
player went down.
</P>
<P>
   At the 16:40 mark, Dallas defenseman Darryl Sydor was helped off
the ice because of an injury to his left leg. He appeared to have
awkwardly bent his left ankle while spinning off a check with Scott
Gomez, then banged into the boards.
</P>
<P>
   With the puck knocked into the opposite corner of the Dallas
zone, Sydor tried getting up to chase the play, but couldn't put
any weight on the leg, forcing him to drop to all fours and crawl
toward the action.
</P>
<P>
   Play was finally stopped once he had scooted near the Dallas
goal. He kept his left ankle off the ice as he was helped to the
locker room.
</P>
<P>
   Sydor did not return, and the team said only that he had a leg
injury.
</P>
<P>
   Just 28 seconds later, the Stars saw center Joe Nieuwendyk
sprawled on the ice on his back, barely moving. He remained that
way for several seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk, the MVP of last season's playoffs, was flipped onto
his head by Arnott after they met in a face off. Arnott caught his
stick under Nieuwendyk's left thigh, then used it to jerk
Nieuwendyk into the air. No penalty was called.
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk walked off on his own power and was back minutes
later.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Martin Brodeur sat slumped in a chair, goalie pads
still on, puffing on a victory cigar in the small visitors'
dressing room.
</P>
<P>
   The two-time winner finally could relax after the New Jersey
Devils beat the Dallas Stars 2-1 in double overtime Saturday night,
snatching the prized trophy away from the defending champions.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an unbelievable feeling,'' said Brodeur, who made 30
saves in his 73rd consecutive playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur carried one of his sons, dressed in No. 30 jersey, into
the crammed dressing room.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's all over,'' the elder Brodeur said.
</P>
<P>
   It was during the triple-overtime loss that Brodeur's wife
Melanie was shown covering her eyes -- too afraid to watch -- and
then dejected when a sixth game was forced.
</P>
<P>
   She was in attendance again Saturday night and was mocked on the
Reunion Arena video screen by a female fan dressed in similar
attire and rubbing her eyes with a crying towel.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   YOUNG GUNS: The Devils' quartet of Scott Gomez, John Madden,
Brian Rafalski and Colin White are now young champions in select
company.
</P>
<P>
   The group joined seven teams since 1927 that had at least four
rookies on championship squads.
</P>
<P>
   White, who still has rookie status, can do it again next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Montreal Canadiens did it last in 1986 when they had seven
rookies, including Devils forward Claude Lemieux and Dallas' Brian
Skrudland. Montreal also did it in 1971 with five and in 1956 with
four.
</P>
<P>
   The 1952 Detroit Red Wings won the cup with four, Toronto played
seven rookies in 1947 and Boston had five in 1939 and four a decade
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   FOR PETR: Top line forward Petr Sykora was injured in the
first period and was in the hospital when linemate Jason Arnott won
the Stanley Cup for the New Jersey Devils 8:20 into double
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's one of the hearts and souls of our line,'' Arnott said.
''We came into the dressing room and Patty (Patrik Elias) looked at
each other and said 'We've got to do this for Petr.' That goal was
definitely for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Derian Hatcher sent Sykora flying with a hit that the Devils
forward didn't see coming. He was wheeled off the ice with his head
and neck immobilized. A CT scan at the hospital was negative and he
was held overnight for observation.
</P>
<P>
   Elias wore Sykora's jersey while celebrating in the dressing
room and planned to go from the arena to the hospital, with the
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had real feelings when that happened to Petr,'' Elias said.
''I think every one of us wanted to win this for Petr.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   LINEUP: Dallas coach Ken Hitchcock made lineup changes for
Game 6, mostly necessitated by the inability of Jamie Langenbrunner
to play on his sore knee.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock had Blake Sloan in the lineup and scratched Roman
Lyashenko. Sloan did not play in Game 5 and the thought was that
his fresh legs could help the Stars to stave off elimination for
the second time.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   Langenbrunner missed five games after hurting his knee in the
conference finals. He returned for Game 4 of this series against
the Devils, but could not go in the final two games.
</P>
<P>
   Grant Marshall, who was also in the lineup, Lyashenko, Sloan and
Aaron Gavey, all have had limited play in the finals.
</P>
<P>
   Gavey, who was also scratched Saturday night, was tired in the
morning even though he didn't play in Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd pay someone to take my skates off for me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   SUPERSTITIOUS STARS: The Stars' superstitions didn't pan out
in Game 6.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Keane's red sportcoat is now 13-1 in the playoffs and Ed
Belfour's lucky skates couldn't pull out another overtime win.
</P>
<P>
   It's time for Brenden Morrow to find a new way home. The
21-year-old forward has developed some quirks that he hopes will
pay off.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have little ones, nothing really strange,'' said Morrow, who
is dating the 18-year-old daughter of 41-year-old teammate Guy
Carbonneau. ''I drive to the rink one way, if we lose I won't drive
that way again. I'll take a different exit or something.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Keane's fashion statement, Morrow was amused at first.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought he was doing it just to get a laugh,'' he said. ''I
didn't know the record he had with it. I asked around as to what
was the deal with this red jacket and somebody filled me in.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   LARRY LEGEND: New Jersey coach Larry Robinson, who already has
six Stanley Cup rings as a star defenseman with Montreal and
another as a Devils assistant in 1995, made history with his eighth
title Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson took over for the fired Robbie Ftorek with eight
regular-season games left. He became just the third coach to win a
championship after taking over a team in midseason. He would join
Toronto's Dick Irvin (1932) and Montreal's Al MacNeil (1971).
</P>
<P>
   He also is the 14th coach to both play and coach a champion.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not about me,'' Robinson said. ''I am happy for those
guys that are out there.''

<HEADLINE> Derailed train leaks hazardous chemicals  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BINGHAMTON, N.Y. (AP) - Several homes were evacuated Saturday
night after a derailed train car began leaking a hazardous
chemical.
</P>
<P>
   No injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-nine of the Delaware &AMP; Hudson Railroad train's 82 cars
were derailed in the rural town of Harpursville, 16 miles east of
Bingahmton, said state police Sgt. Steven Meyer. Seventeen of those
29 contained hazardous materials.
</P>
<P>
   The derailment happened about 2:45 p.m. Saturday east of Route
79 in Harpursville, parallel to Route 7.
</P>
<P>
   A car carrying methyl chloride began leaking sometime after the
accident and before 9 p.m., when houses in a half-mile radius were
evacuated. The Broome County Hazardous Materials Response Unit was
working overnight to contain the spill.
</P>
<P>
   Methyl chloride is a colorless, flammable material that is toxic
in high concentrations.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the train's other cars were carrying sulfuric acid and
propane, Meyer said. Soil in the area was found to be contaminated
with nickel hydroxide, which is flammable and toxic as a dust or
fume.
</P>
<P>
   Officials were still investigating the cause of the accident.
The train was going 35 mph, the posted speed limit.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Sabol of Harpursville said the track was lifted on its side
and cars that were ''stacked, tipped and twisted.''
</P>
<P>
   D&AMP;H Railroad officials declined comment.

<HEADLINE> Couple files suit after groom arrested in 1996 wedding  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PLAINFIELD, Conn. (AP) -A Plainfield couple is suing state
police and the owners of the restaurant where they held their
wedding reception, claiming their party was broken up after an
exaggerated report of a brawl.
</P>
<P>
   Walter and Silena Ford were celebrating their wedding at the
Countryside Chicken restaurant in North Stonington on Sept. 21,
1996 when state police arrived.
</P>
<P>
   The groom was pepper-sprayed, handcuffed and charged with breach
of peace and resisting arrest. A jury later acquitted him on all
charges.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit blames restaurant owners Anthony and Ann Selvedio
for ''falsely reporting a disturbance to the police as dangerous
when in fact there was no imminent danger'' and ''failing to inform
the police that the disturbance was over.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fords say a guest had become intoxicated and unruly but they
forced him to leave the party before police were called.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a beautiful wedding until they ruined it,'' said Silena
Ford, 25. ''We had a great time up until that point.''
</P>
<P>
   Police had said that Ford became belligerent and was swearing
loudly. Ford said he was upset and may have raised his voice, but
he never swore.
</P>
<P>
   A trial has been set for July 7 in New London Superior Court.
The lawsuit seeks $139,000 in damages for false arrest,
unreasonable and excessive force, unlawful detention, malicious
prosecution and harassment.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been four years that I've been fighting this in court,''
Walter Ford said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, adamant about his innocence, took the misdemeanor charges
to trial rather than settling for an $88 fine and a $300
contribution to a state police battered women's fund.
</P>
<P>
   ''They ruined my wedding, so why should we have to contribute
anything to the state police?'' said the 31-year-old father of two.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys representing now-retired state Trooper R. James Barnes
Jr., who is named in the lawsuit, and the Selvedios, whose
restaurant has since closed, could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   If they win their civil case, the Fords say they plan another
reception and honeymoon to make up for what happened the first
time.

<HEADLINE> Wanna bet? Wagering on sports a political tradition  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Texas Gov. George W. Bush and New Jersey Gov.
Christie Whitman have lots to discuss - there's that little matter
of whether Bush will consider Whitman as his vice presidential
candidate - but their last talk centered on seafood and barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   In advance of hockey's Stanley Cup championship, the two
Republicans agreed on the terms of a wager: If the Devils won the
best-of-seven series, Whitman and her family would get a Texas
barbecue. If the Stars won, Bush and family would get a New Jersey
seafood dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Early Sunday morning, the Devils won the cup, making a winner of
Whitman. But Whitman revealed last week that a Texas barbecue
wasn't her first choice.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I really wanted to do with George W. - but he wouldn't do
it with me - is offer him and the family a weekend at the beach
house in exchange for a weekend at Camp David for me and my
family,'' Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who gets use of Camp David only if he wins the presidency,
felt ''that would be presumptuous,'' she added with a mischievous
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   The beach house Whitman referred to is a gubernatorial perk
located at Island Beach State Park.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman wagered use of the beach house last year in a bet with
Colorado Gov. Bill Owens on the outcome of the New York Jets-Denver
Broncos NFL playoff game. The Broncos won, and so did Owens.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's got a weekend at the beach coming,'' Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman won her 1995 bet with Michigan Gov. John Engler when the
Devils won their first Stanley Cup against the Detroit Red Wings.
When the National Governors Association met that summer in Vermont,
Engler kept his end of the bargain by trying on a bright red Devils
jersey with Engler's name - and the Stanley Cup patch - already
sewn in.
</P>
<P>
   Bets between governors have become a common link between sports
and politics.
</P>
<P>
   When the Stars beat the Buffalo Sabres for the 1999 Stanley Cup,
Bush won a bet with New York Gov. George Pataki - and, potentially,
a stomach ache. Under the terms of the wager, Pataki owed Bush 100
of Buffalo's hottest chicken wings, and a dozen of a city specialty
sandwich: roast beef with horseradish on salty rolls.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge lost a bet with Engler when
the Red Wings beat the Philadelphia Flyers for the Stanley Cup. To
pay off, Ridge had to don a Red Wings jersey and drive a Zamboni
machine on the ice before the Red Wings' opener the next season.
</P>
<P>
   After the St. Louis Rams became Super Bowl champions earlier
this year, Tennessee Gov. Don Sundquist made good on a bet by
sending Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan a basket packed with country
ham, Jack Daniel's Whisky, candy bars and other Tennessee products.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Shure, who was communications director for former New Jersey
Gov. Jim Florio, recalled that Florio tried to bet then-New York
Gov. Mario Cuomo on the outcome of the 1991 Super Bowl, which
pitted the Buffalo Bills against the New Jersey-based, but New
York-named, Giants.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem,'' Shure said, ''was that Cuomo claimed both
teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Thomas H. Kean, who preceded Florio in office, said his
best bet was with Roy Romer, then the governor of Colorado, on the
outcome of the Broncos-Giants Super Bowl in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ''I bet him a whole load of New Jersey seafood,'' Kean recalled.
''He bet me a steer. Of course the Giants won the Super Bowl, and
the next thing I knew the steer was making its way toward New
Jersey,'' stopping along the way to promote Colorado beef.
</P>
<P>
   Kean got letters from New Jersey animal-rights activists
horrified at the idea of slaughtering the new celebrity. After
meeting the animal at Giants Stadium - ''I thought it was a pretty
antsy beast: you know, it snorted at you'' - Kean named it Jersey
Giant and decided to find it a home.
</P>
<P>
   That turned out to be the Howell Living History Farm in
Hopewell, part of the Mercer County Park Commission. There, Jersey
Giant helped recreate farm life at the turn of the last century by
pulling plows, cultivators and wagons.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Watson, director of the farm, said Jersey Giant died in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   ''He reached 11. That's pretty old for a steer,'' Watson said.
''Most of them were intended to become beef at the ripe old age of
9 months.''
</P>
<P>
   Kean insisted that, over his eight years in office, he never had
to pay off a bet.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I was governor, we didn't let New Jersey teams lose,'' he
said. ''Never!''

<HEADLINE> Koreas Summit Delayed by One Day  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL SHIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- The summit this week between leaders
of North and South Korea has been delayed by one day at the North's
request, the Seoul government said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The first-ever inter-Korean summit was delayed for ''minor
technical reasons'' and was not in jeopardy, said Park June-young,
chief spokesman for President Kim Dae-jung.
</P>
<P>
   ''The chief executive believes that waiting for one extra day is
not a major issue since the two sides have waited over half a
century,'' Park June-young said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear why North Korea, which is exercising tight,
secretive control of summit procedure and publicity, requested the
delay.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea has a detailed itinerary for the summit, but at the
North's request won't disclose its contents. Also, South Korea
government officials say North Korea is extremely nervous about
possible negative media reports of the communist country during the
summit.
</P>
<P>
   Culture and Tourism Minister Park Jie-won said that North Korea
complained about South Korean media reports detailing President
Kim's itinerary in the North, but he was not sure whether that had
anything to do with the request for the delay.
</P>
<P>
   Kim's three-day summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Il will
begin Tuesday in Pyongyang, according to the South Korean
government. The meeting offers hope for a gradual reconciliation on
the Korean peninsula after decades of bitter conflict.
</P>
<P>
   A 30-member southern advance team is in Pyongyang to help
prepare Kim Dae-jung's itinerary and press coverage. Both Koreas
have agreed not to disclose details of the summit itinerary.
</P>
<P>
   But South Korean media reported the itinerary in detail.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential spokesman said North Korea requested the delay
in a telephone message sent late Saturday night through Panmunjom,
a border village inside the Demilitarized Zone separating the two
Koreas.
</P>
<P>
   The two Korean leaders are expected to discuss the dispatch of
economic aid from the rich South to the impoverished North, as well
as the reunion of separated families.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most contentious issues that might be raised are the
37,000-strong U.S. military presence in South Korea, and North
Korea's missile and nuclear programs.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's agreement to host a summit is a notable compromise
because it previously disdained most attempts at dialogue by Seoul,
a government it considered illegitimate.
</P>
<P>
   The two countries agreed to a summit in 1994. But North Korean
leader Kim Il Sung died at age 82 only weeks before he was to meet
his South Korean counterpart, Kim Young-sam.
</P>
<P>
   His son and successor, Kim Jong Il, consolidated his power in
the years that followed.
</P>
<P>
   The peninsula was divided at the end of World War II in 1945
into the communist North and the pro-Western South. A heavily
militarized border separates the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Travelers asked to help design Pa. Turnpike rest stops  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) - Travelers are getting a chance to
influence what amenities they will have along the Pennsylvania
Turnpike in future years - and even whether there should be more
places to enjoy them.
</P>
<P>
   The Turnpike Commission has been surveying travelers about what
they think of the current setup, and changes they would like made
in a few years as the rest stops are upgraded.
</P>
<P>
   Now travelers who haven't been contacted can contribute their
opinions by logging onto the turnpike Web site and filling out a
23-question survey.
</P>
<P>
   They will be asked whether the service plazas should include
such comforts as showers, hotel accommodations, Internet access,
auto service and repair, or more dining options.
</P>
<P>
   ''As we look to the future, turnpike service plazas must meet
the needs and changing expectations of our customers,'' executive
director John T. Durbin said.
</P>
<P>
   The 507-mile turnpike system now has 22 service plazas, all
along the 360-mile east-west main line or the 110-mile Northeast
Extension. The rest stop plazas, open 24 hours a day, now offer
fuel, fast food and some restaurants, bank machines, public
telephones and other amenities.
</P>
<P>
   Every plaza used to be a Howard Johnson's, but beginning in 1987
they were transformed into a mix of franchises including Burger
King, McDonald's, Bob's Big Boy, Roy Rogers and Sbarro.
</P>
<P>
   Field surveys were conducted in February that targeted truckers,
business travelers, commuters and leisure travelers, and officials
are now seeking input over the Internet. The next field survey to
be done in August will have more detailed questions, spokesman Carl
DeFebo said.
</P>
<P>
   The current survey asks travelers how often they use the plazas
and when, and what services they use and to rank in importance the
available services.
</P>
<P>
   For example, on the subject of food, travelers are asked to rate
their interest in such things as 24-hour drive-through windows,
cafeteria-style restaurants, family-style restaurants, food courts
and 24-hour breakfast service.
</P>
<P>
   The turnpike commission also asks travelers how likely they
would be to use services such as showers, hotels, business services
such as fax and copying machines, or expanded tourist information.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the results, travelers should see changes over the next
three to five years. The planning process is tied to contracts with
turnpike concessionaires that expire between 2004 and 2009.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to have to know well in advance of those dates how
we're going to proceed,'' DeFebo said.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the response, the turnpike may consider things it
has rejected in the past, such as hotels, and may add more plazas.
The turnpike closed four plazas in the 1980s, at Mechanicsburg,
Denver, Path Valley by the Tuscarora Tunnel and Pleasant Valley
between the Pittsburgh and Irwin interchanges.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Mechanicsburg plaza closed, westbound patrons have had
to travel 56.3 miles to another plaza. The survey asks customers
what they think the driving distances should be between plazas and
where new ones should be located.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will look at what users want to see in the service plazas,
compare those desires to what is currently available, and recommend
changes where needed,'' Gregg Schwotzer, president of Crossgates
Inc. of McMurray, said in December.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will also carefully evaluate the condition and location of
every service plaza and assess what should be done to make sure the
facilities reach their full potential,'' said Schwotzer, project
director for the consortium.
</P>
<P>
   Once the surveys are completed, a consortium of companies known
as ''The Turnpike Planning Consultants'' will do a marketing
analysis, and recommendations should be ready late next year.

<HEADLINE> S.Koreans Travel North for Summit  </HEADLINE>
By SANG-HUN CHOE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Eager for economic opportunities, some
of South Korea's richest men will travel with President Kim
Dae-jung to his summit this week with North Korean leader Kim Jong
Il. But once they get there, displaying their wealth is off-limits.
</P>
<P>
   ''Please don't flash your dollars to the North Korean guides.
That will displease them more than anything else,'' Suh Young-kyo,
a Seoul government official, told the businessmen and other members
of President Kim's entourage last week.
</P>
<P>
   Suh was listing the dos and don'ts in North Korea for a
130-member South Korea entourage that will go to the North Korean
capital of Pyongyang for the three-day summit, which begins
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The first-ever inter-Korean summit was delayed a day for ''minor
technical reasons'' and not in jeopardy, Park June-young, chief
spokesman for President Kim Dae-jung, said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   A 30-member southern advance team is in Pyongyang to help
prepare President Kim's itinerary and press coverage. Fifty South
Korean journalists will attend the first meeting between leaders of
the Koreas.
</P>
<P>
   The makeup of the entourage speaks volumes about what South
Korea's Kim seeks at the summit. He will take with him many top
industrialists and leading proponents of engagement with the
communist North, but few military officials.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half of the 24 non-governmental delegates are
businessmen. Most of Kim's key economic aides and ministers are on
the list. A senior national security adviser accompanies Kim, but
the defense minister is not on the list. A brigadier general is the
highest-ranking representative of the South Korean military.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea's ultimate goal is to end half a century of Cold War
animosities and eventually bring about reunification.
</P>
<P>
   Kim's best card is South Korea's economic might. Kim hopes that
impoverished North Korea will agree to a gradual process of
openness in return for investment and economic exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   The South Korean delegates will tread carefully for fear of
injuring North Korea's fierce pride.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's OK to say thank you to North Koreans, but never pat them
on their back. They may take it as an insult,'' Suh lectured.
''Don't make jokes. And never carry any book or magazine that
criticizes North Korea. That could disrupt the atmosphere for the
summit.''
</P>
<P>
   South Korea's four largest conglomerates -- Hyundai, Samsung, LG
and SK -- are sending their chairman or vice chairman. All want to
expand operations in the North, where labor is cheap.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the businessmen, Chang Chi-hyuk and Kang Sung-mo, have
more than money at stake.
</P>
<P>
   They are among millions of family members hoping for a reunion
with relatives separated by the Korean War that ended in 1953
without a peace treaty. Reunions will be a summit topic.
</P>
<P>
   Delegate Chung Mong-joon, son of the founder of the Hyundai
conglomerate, heads South Korea's football association and hopes to
persuade North Korea to host a couple of games of the 2002 World
Cup soccer tournament. South Korea and Japan are co-hosting the
event.
</P>
<P>
   Another member of the entourage is South Korean First Lady Lee
Hee-ho, who is involved in charity work. She might not get to chat
with her counterpart because Kim Jong Il's wife, Kim Young Sook,
has never attended state functions.
</P>
<P>
   The South Korean group also includes two scholars, a playwright,
a newspaper president and maybe a couple of dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Woo Moo-jong, president of South Korea's National Canine
Association, said he has asked President Kim to take two Jin-do
dogs, which are indigenous to South Korea and a national symbol, as
a present to Kim Jong Il. It is not known whether the dogs will
make the trip.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia General Denies War Crimes  </HEADLINE>
By GEOFF SPENCER
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Indonesia's former military chief,
Gen. Wiranto, denied Sunday that he is a war criminal and hoped an
inquiry into his role in last year's devastation of East Timor
would end in a peaceful compromise.
</P>
<P>
   The retired four-star army general was forced to step down as
defense minister in February after an Indonesian investigation and
a separate U.N. inquiry found him ultimately responsible for
atrocities committed in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Neither, though, uncovered evidence that Wiranto was personally
involved in organizing the violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think I am a war criminal,'' Wiranto said in an
interview with The Associated Press. ''I think that is an unfair
statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Anti-independence militia and some Indonesian soldiers went on a
rampage after East Timor voted overwhelmingly for independence in a
U.N.-supervised ballot that ended 24 years of Indonesian rule.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of civilians were killed, thousands of buildings were
wrecked and burned and tens of thousands of people were displaced.
</P>
<P>
   Order was restored only after an Australian-led peacekeeping
force arrived and Indonesian troops withdrew.
</P>
<P>
   Wiranto has consistently denied responsibility for the mayhem
and said Sunday that he had tried hard to maintain peace before and
after the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The Indonesian government is under global pressure to punish the
perpetrators of the violence. It overcame calls for the
establishment of an international war crimes tribunal by promising
to bring those responsible to justice through its own court system.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Attorney General Marzuki Darusman said he hoped to
name several key suspects in the East Timor case by August.
</P>
<P>
   Wiranto, who formally resigned his suspended Cabinet post last
month, has been questioned twice recently by the attorney general's
office. He has also maintained his innocence before the national
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope everything can be finished with a compromise,'' he said
when asked if he thought charges might be filed against him.
</P>
<P>
   Wiranto said he is now writing a book about his experiences as
armed forces commander and a minister under three presidents.
</P>
<P>
   During the 32-year authoritarian rule of ex-President Suharto,
the military carried out human rights abuses to crush dissent. Now,
two years after Suharto's departure from power, opponents accuse it
of fomenting civil and ethnic unrest across the sprawling Southeast
Asian nation.
</P>
<P>
   Wiranto rejected the accusations, saying the fighting was the
result of welled up feelings of injustice over a range of economic,
political, social and cultural problems.
</P>
<P>
   These had exploded with the coming of new freedoms after
Suharto's ouster amid riots and protests in May 1998, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The (military) has a part to play in resolving the problem. It
is not part of the problem. It has to solve the problem,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Fiji Indians Mull Future at Wedding  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE CORDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Kirti Hargovind's ceremonially decorated hands
were draped in fake gold on her wedding day Sunday. She was afraid
she'd be robbed if she wore her real jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   Only 150 guests out of 600 originally invited to Hargovind's
wedding at a Hindu temple in the Fijian capital Suva showed up
because the families feared a large celebration would attract the
attention of angry Fijians who destroyed ethnic Indian-owned stores
on May 19.
</P>
<P>
   That was the day rebel George Speight launched his nationalist
coup and took Fiji's government hostage in a crisis now in its
fourth week.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wanted it to be bigger, but since the coup we have had to
keep a low profile,'' said bridegroom Prabal Arora, an ethnic
Indian. ''We had to streamline and keep it simple.''
</P>
<P>
   The only thing making some guests feel safe was a road block
manned by heavily armed Fijian troops just 660 feet away from the
temple.
</P>
<P>
   The reception later at a local hotel was also cut short because
the guests had to return home before the dusk-to-dawn curfew
imposed by the country's new military rulers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will have another, bigger reception after the curfew is
lifted,'' Hargovind said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the restrictions, the couple looked happy and proud,
Arora in a gray suit and Hargovind in a red and white sari
decorated with gold embroidery.
</P>
<P>
   Both were wearing garlands of white petals and green leaves at
the traditional ceremony and Hargovind's hands and feet were
intricately decorated with Indian patterns painted in henna, a
plant-based dye.
</P>
<P>
   But while they celebrated with their guests, they also thought
of the people too scared to attend.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some people have not turned up because they were too
frightened,'' said Hargovind's brother, Dilash.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the temple, guests were discussing the coup.
</P>
<P>
   Speight's rebels are still holding 31 government hostages in
parliament -- most of them ethnic Indians -- to demand a new
constitution stripping the Indians of the right to hold the office
of prime minister and boosting the powers of indigenous Fijians.
</P>
<P>
   Late Sunday, Speight met with Ratu Josefa Iloilo, the man
suggested by influential tribal chiefs to become the next
president. Speight has also publicly endorsed him.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a very fruitful meeting, they covered a lot of
ground,'' Speight spokesman Joe Nata said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   By agreeing to Iloilo, Speight has made a concession, but only a
minor one since the office carries little political power. The
selection of a new government is more crucial and has been the
sticking point between Speight and Fiji's new military rulers ever
since talks on ending the crisis broke down more than a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   Military leaders have already agreed to grant amnesty to Speight
and the gunmen who stormed parliament. The military also has
scrapped the 1997 constitution and ousted President Ratu Sir
Kamisese Mara -- moves that fulfilled two of Speight's demands.
</P>
<P>
   Speight's storming of parliament triggered an orgy of arson and
looting of Indian-owned stores in Suva and many Indians, who make
up 44 percent of Fiji's population, are now just waiting for
normality to return before they flee the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many poorer people, if they have the slightest chance, will
get out,'' said Anand Patel, a local dentist.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no future here for us. It took us 10 years to rebuild
after the last coup (in 1987). It will take 20 years to recover
this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Chauhan Lal, who runs a cafe close to a Suva school, agreed. His
business has suffered because schoolchildren who supply most of his
income have been given extended vacation until the crisis ends.
</P>
<P>
   But even amid Fiji's coup crisis, the bride and groom beamed
throughout the ceremony. The guests smiled and laughed while photos
were taken before sitting in the shade of a jacaranda tree to eat
lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ''To me, it does not matter,'' Arora said. ''I have the right
wife. I am with the right people in the right place.''

<HEADLINE> 7-year-old saves baby sitter from drowning  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALPINE, N.J. (AP) - She was supposed to be protecting the child,
but a 23-year-old New York woman found herself being rescued from
drowning by a 7-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Elia Luna of Queens was watching Mikella Goldman as the two were
in a backyard pool Saturday when the woman started struggling.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was doing backstrokes not really well, and then she
floated down in the water,'' the girl said.
</P>
<P>
   Her father, Richard Goldman, said he was reading a newspaper
when he looked up and saw Mikella appear in the shallow section,
pulling the floating Luna, who was motionless and face down, by the
foot.
</P>
<P>
   He pulled Luna from the pool, saw she wasn't breathing, and gave
her mouth-to-mouth resuscitation as Mikella ran inside the house
and called 911.
</P>
<P>
   Luna regained consciousness and was taken to Englewood Hospital
and Medical Center, where she was recovering. She said she did not
know why she lost consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Mikella said she was upset to see Luna taken away in an
ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was sad because she's my favorite babysitter,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Attack Reported on Solomon Islands  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM FOREMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONIARA, Solomon Islands (AP) -- A new group of militants gunned
down a man Sunday in the Solomon Islands, officials said, a killing
that diplomats feared could end a fragile cease-fire and spark
another cycle of revenge attacks in the South Pacific nation.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting came as a new wave of foreign tourists and workers,
many pushing carts piled high with luggage, lined up at the airport
in the capital, Honiara, for what could be some of the last
evacuation planes out of the nation. At a nearby port, hundreds of
local residents squeezed on board crowded ferries, fleeing the city
to other provinces.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the evacuations, Honiara did not look like it was on the
verge of chaos. Rebels who seized the prime minister and took
control of the capital last week were no longer cruising the
capital's streets with weapons looted from the main armory and no
gunfire could be heard.
</P>
<P>
   But the fatal shooting Sunday in Gizo, the capital of Western
Province, appeared to be politically motivated and stirred fears of
new violence in Honiara.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the killing were sketchy because telephone service in
Gizo was down, but a rebel leader and local media blamed the death
on militants from Bougainville. The island is part of Papua New
Guinea and was the scene of a 10-year secessionist war that killed
thousands before a 1998 cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   ''I suspect they are offering themselves as mercenaries,'' said
Andrew Nori, a former lawmaker and leader of rebels from the island
of Malaita.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their (The Bougainville militants') mission is to evict the
Malaitans from the Western Province,'' Nori said, adding that the
victim was Malaitan.
</P>
<P>
   Kicking the Malaitans off the main island of Guadalcanal has
also been the goal of the Isatabus. During the past 18 months, the
Isatabus have forced about 20,000 migrant Malaitans back to
Malaita.
</P>
<P>
   Angry that they have received no compensation for their losses,
the Malaitans have taken up arms and demanded the resignation of
Prime Minister Bartholomew Ulufa'alu. The leader faces a vote of no
confidence in the parliament on Thursday. Ulufa'alu is a Malaitan,
but his people accuse him of being too soft on the Isatabus.
</P>
<P>
   If lawmakers vote to keep Ulufa'alu in office, many fear that
the Malaitans will refuse to handover their guns and will use them
to stage another coup. Although Nori is believed to want peace, it
was unclear how much influence he had over rebels who are growing
bolder after their recent successes.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels, or Malaita Eagle Force, have been trying to win the
public over by keeping order in Honiaria, where looting and other
lawlessness have been rare. Police said the fighters have taken
over police duties and even use Honiaria's jail to lock up rebels
who have misbehaved.

   ''They have our guns and everything, so we're just sitting back
and relaxing,'' said police Sgt. Alec Toata, pointing to a long,
empty rifle rack in the main police station. ''People now call
them, not us.''
</P>
<P>
   Up the street from the police station, rebels with teeth stained
red from chewing betel nut, a mild stimulant, lounge around in lawn
chairs outside their barracks, a drab office building they seized
from the provincial government of Guadalcanal.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a baseball cap with the word ''Police'' on it, rebel
Charles Addix stood behind a counter in a small office and helped a
woman file a claim for luggage lost on a ferry boat. He dismissed
the exodus of people from the capital as irrational panic and said
they would return in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Foreigners should feel safe here,'' Addix said. ''Our problem
is only with the Isatabu Freedom Movement.''

<HEADLINE> Host families keep elderly out of nursing homes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KILLINGWORTH, Conn. (AP) - At 74 years old, Mary Robinson is not
a typical adoptee. But in a program that helps elderly people
continue living in the community, she has found a new family.
</P>
<P>
   The program, funded by the state and administered by a New Haven
social service agency, seeks host families for seniors who need
care but not yet that of a nursing home. The host family receives a
monthly payment of $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like this very much,'' said Robinson, who moved in with the
family of Paul and Amy Thomas in March 1999. ''You're in with a
family and they're all very nice, every one of them. I love them
and they love me.''
</P>
<P>
   Sage Services of Connecticut administers the program with the
aid of a $25,000 state grant. Assistant Director Shahnaz Solati
said there are four clients living with host families but the
program is pushing for more.
</P>
<P>
   Before Robinson was ''adopted'' in March 1999, she would often
huddle alone in her room at a convalescent home, listening to
classical music. A retired legal secretary with no family of her
own, Robinson suffers from heart problems, osteoporosis and
Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the Thomases, she goes out to eat with the family,
visits relatives and accompanies Amy Thomas on errands. She even
lends a hand with the family's two children -Paul Jr., 8, and
Cayla, 13.
</P>
<P>
   ''If things don't seem to be going well, I'll come home and
she'll sit down and talk with me and tell me what a great mother I
am and that I do a good job,'' said Amy Thomas, who works part-time
as a nursing home aide. ''She boosts me back up again.''
</P>
<P>
   Amy Thomas said that when Robinson first moved into the house,
she tended to spend most of her time in her room. She often wore a
downtrodden look, Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, Robinson began to feel like a part of the family.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we go out somewhere and we're pulling in the driveway,
she'll say, 'This is our road,' '' Thomas said. ''Then she'll say,
'And there's our lovely home.' ''
</P>
<P>
   An aide comes to help Robinson shower in the morning. After the
kids have gone to school and Paul Sr. to work, she and Amy Thomas
have breakfast. Robinson, a deeply religious Roman Catholic, then
goes to her room to pray.
</P>
<P>
   During the day, she and Thomas may do some chores together.
Robinson eats supper with the family each night.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson ends her evening by giving a goodnight kiss to each
member of the family. Often when she gets into bed, Ashlee, the
family's small dog, is waiting for her.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said she cherishes the love she exchanges with the
family.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to be nice to everyone because people really want to
be nice to you,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Bashar Ascension May Set Precedent  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA ABU-NASR
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Bashar Assad's imminent rise to the
presidency of Syria could turn an idea many Arab leaders have
nurtured for years into a precedent: grooming their sons to
establish ''republican dynasties'' to ensure that power remains in
the family after they're gone.
</P>
<P>
   The transition of power from father to son has gone smoothly in
Jordan, Morocco, Bahrain and Qatar -- all monarchies. Before
President Hafez Assad's death Saturday, the phenomenon had never
been tried in a republic.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Bashar, other presidential sons whose destinies
are being shaped by their fathers include Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein's sons, Odai, 36, and Qusai, 34; Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak's younger son Gamal, who is in his 30s; Yemeni President
Ahmed Ali Abdullah Saleh's son, Ahmed, 30; and Libyan leader
Moammar Gadhafi's sons Seif al-Islam and Al-Saadi, the head of his
country's football federation who also aspires to be Africa's
greatest soccer player.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's bizarre that in a whole series of countries that are
nominally republics there's an expectation that the leadership will
go from father to son,'' said William Quandt, a University of
Virginia professor who participated in the Egyptian-Israeli peace
talks in 1978. ''It shows how weak the political institutions are
in those countries and how personalized politics is.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Bashar's rise to power would be trouble-free is yet to
be seen. This largely depends on the response of Syria's political
and military establishments to a hereditary-style power transfer
and on whether another family member, his ambitious uncle Rifaat
who has been banished to France since staging a 1984 coup attempt
against Assad, would cause trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Bashar moved closer to succeeding his father Sunday as the
ruling Baath Party unanimously nominated him for president. Later
in the day, one of Syria's two vice presidents declared Bashar
commander of the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are divided over whether Bashar's ascension to the
presidency would set a good example for the rest of the Arab world.
Of the 21 Arab states, 13 are republics with varying degrees of
popular participation. Free speech often is limited. Parliaments --
where they exist -- act mainly as a rubber-stamp for the leader.
Referendums are organized to produce overwhelming electoral
endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   ''The aim of making Bashar president is to guarantee the
continuity of President Assad's path, which has brought stability
to Syria for 30 years,'' said Sarkis Naoum, a columnist at
An-Nahar, Lebanon's most independent newspaper. ''Any change in the
political system at this stage will bring instability to the
region.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Ghassan Beshara, media director at the Washington-based
Middle East Report, said ''to simply inherit, simply move into the
position without any competition or any fair and free election is
quite unhealthy.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The rest of the world is moving toward greater openness and
democracy. ... We're going against the norm,'' added Beshara, who
is of Palestinian origin.
</P>
<P>
   The elevation of presidential sons to the rank of heir-apparent
marks a change from the 1960s and 1970s when presidencies were
toppled by military officers. Assad, Saleh and Gadhafi came to
power in such coups. Mubarak was head of the air force before being
appointed vice president.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon of ''republican dynasties'' began emerging in
Iraq in the 1980s. Soon after his son Odai graduated from college,
President Hussein appointed him head of the Olympic Committee, a
position equivalent to that of a minister's, head of the
Journalists' Syndicate and head of the Iraqi Writers' and Artists'
Union.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam then put his younger son, Qusai, in charge of the
Republican Guard, an elite army corps, and security and
intelligence agencies. Both sons are reportedly vying for their
father's job.
</P>
<P>
   Other contenders began to appear. Assad brought Bashar home from
Britain where he was studying to be an eye doctor to prepare him
for the presidency after his eldest son, Bassil, died in a car
crash 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak has recently named Gamal, an economist, as a member of
the general secretariat of his ruling National Democratic Party;
Gadhafi's sons have been assuming larger public roles, standing in
for their father at some public occasions; Saleh's son, Ahmed, is
an army colonel and has been a parliament member since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   If Bashar becomes president, he will join a number of younger
rulers who have come to power in the past few years -- Jordan's King
Abdullah II, 38; Morocco's King Mohammed VI, 36; Sheik Hamad bin
Isa Al Khalifa, 50, of Bahrain; and Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa Al
Thani of Qatar, 47.
</P>
<P>
   ''These people came to maturity in the 1980s and 1990s. They'll
be more in tune with the majority of the population and more in
tune with the world,'' said Rashid Khalidi, professor of Middle
East history at the University of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Would a younger leadership translate into a more benign Middle
East?
</P>
<P>
   ''What that will mean in terms of democracy, liberalization and
the rule of law remains to be seen,'' said Khalidi.

<HEADLINE> Path to efficiency for hospitals fraught with peril  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL HILL
<TEXT>
<P>
   POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. (AP) - Vassar Brothers and St. Francis are
not the first hospitals to find the road to affiliation loaded with
landmines.
</P>
<P>
   An innovative maneuver allowed the two Poughkeepsie hospitals to
combine some costly operations without fully merging. These types
of joint operating agreements can allow coupled Roman Catholic and
non-Catholic hospitals to avoid controversies over reproductive
services.
</P>
<P>
   It worked fine - until New York's attorney general filed an
anti-trust lawsuit against them. A federal judge ruled against the
hospitals' joint venture in April. They are now scrambling to find
a solution.
</P>
<P>
   The predicament shows how tricky it can be for hospitals to join
operations as a way to remain solvent - particularly when the
merger involves secular and religious hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem arises from the culture clash inherent in
merging Catholic hospitals - which prohibit abortions and some
other reproductive services - and secular institutions. Many
hospitals have instead turned to more limited ''virtual mergers''
as a way of saving money while retaining their identity.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Poughkeepsie case shows, those agreements can also be
judged imperfect.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a strange dynamic right now,'' said State Healthcare
Association President Daniel Sisto. ''Hospitals are caught between
the economic imperative ... and community pressures to keep
individual institutions alive as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals merged in large numbers in the '90's, many of them
citing a financial need. The advocacy group Catholics for a Free
Choice says there were 132 hospital mergers and acquisitions
involving Catholic and non-Catholic hospitals nationwide from 1994
through last September.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Miller, research director for the Washington D.C.-based
group, said the merger rate has slowed since 1998. But she said
population declines and weak economies in parts of New York have
continued to drive area mergers and alliances.
</P>
<P>
   This can cause controversy.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, plans to affiliate the secular Nathan Littauer in
Gloversville in the Mohawk Valley with nearby St. Mary's Catholic
hospital have raised concerns recently.
</P>
<P>
   Another notable case occurred in Kingston when two secular
hospitals proposed to merge with Benedictine Hospital. Community
activists were upset over the potential loss of abortions and
reproductive services at the secular hospitals. The plug was pulled
on that merger in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Merger talks between Vassar and St. Francis were abandoned in
the '80's. In 1992, the two hospitals sought permission to run some
operations jointly.
</P>
<P>
   State health officials in 1994 approved the hospitals' plan for
a joint venture that involved a cardiac catheterization program at
Vassar and other shared operations. The hospitals eventually began
jointly negotiating contracts with insurers, according to court
documents.
</P>
<P>
   That's where they ran into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Two HMOs complained to authorities. In 1998, then-state Attorney
General Dennis Vacco filed a federal anti-trust lawsuit, claiming
the hospitals' charges were about 40 percent above the regional
average.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Court Judge William Conner ruled for the state in
April, saying the hospitals ''effectively fixed prices for most
services by negotiating jointly.''
</P>
<P>
   Conner conceded his decision could cause enough economic
hardship that one of the hospitals could go under, ''which
ironically would result in the end of local competition and an
increase in prices.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Perhaps the state will consider such long-term effects of
rigid enforcement of anti-trust laws,'' Conner wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, officials with Vassar and St. Francis have been talking
to the staff of current attorney general Eliot Spitzer about a
solution.
</P>
<P>
   The hospitals declined commenting on the case. A source familiar
with the case who requested anonymity said a consent agreement that
would allow the hospitals to continue providing care without
violating the law was being negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   Sisto said the ruling has had a chilling effect on affiliation
discussions between other hospitals in New York state and muddied
an already confusing set of statutes.
</P>
<P>
   David Marx, a Chicago lawyer who has structured other virtual
mergers, said the Poughkeepsie case is an exception and that
properly formed agreements do conform with anti-trust law. There
are many other virtual mergers that have worked out fine.
</P>
<P>
   In Buffalo, five Catholic hospitals entered into a joint
operating agreement in 1998. In Long Island, two Port Jefferson
hospitals - St. Charles and John T. Mather Memorial - divvy up
specializations and share some staff under a joint venture that is
several years old.
</P>
<P>
   No anti-trust problems have arisen in either area. And as for
solving the problems between allied Catholic and non-Catholic
hospitals, some creative solutions also have been found there.
</P>
<P>
   After its merger with St. Mary's Hospital of Rochester, Park
Ridge Hospital opened a new birthing center last year. The unit is
operated under Catholic directives. However, women wishing to
undergo sterilization can have the procedure performed in another
part of the hospital.

<HEADLINE> Female legislators want male pronouns out of constitution  </HEADLINE>
By HADLEY PAWLAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The New York state constitution challenges
the capability of women in government by only using male pronouns,
according to two female legislators who want to make document
gender neutral.
</P>
<P>
   In legislation introduced by Assemblywoman Sandra Galef,
D-Westchester, and Sen. Patricia McGee, R-Chautauqua, about 170
masculine references in the 46-page constitution would be feminized
or made gender neutral.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the first step, at least, for those women in
government who have to swear their allegiance to this document that
doesn't even include them,'' said Barbara Bartoletti of the state
chapter of the League of Women Voters.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Schulz, chairman of the We the People Foundation for
Constitutional Education, disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ''Frankly, this rises to the level of frivolity and fiction of
political correctness,'' Schulz said. ''It's a waste of time and
tax money.''
</P>
<P>
   To change the constitution, two separately elected state
Legislatures must adopt the proposed changes. The proposal must
then go before voters in a statewide referendum. Sponsors said they
expect the bill to pass in both houses and face voters as soon as
November 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Galef said the main cost associated with the bill, which has
male and females co-sponsors in both houses, is holding the
referendum. Beyond that, the normal printing costs of updating the
constitution will apply, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Today there are 36 female Assembly members and nine female
senators, making up 21 percent of the New York state legislature.
Since the first two women were elected to the body in 1919, 104
others have followed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the year 2000,'' Galef said. ''We've had three lieutenant
governors who are women, the head of the court system is a women
and one day we'll have a woman governor. It's time for us to change
with the times.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, 10 other states have proposed similar
changes to their constitutions.
</P>
<P>
   ''This issue is coming up more and more,'' said Kelly Anders of
the National Conference of State Legislatures. ''I'm not quite sure
why now is the time. Maybe just because more women continue to
enter public office.''
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gov. Mary Donohue, who is referred to as ''he'' in the
constitution, says it is time to catch up with the strides women
have made.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's never been a major bone of contention with me - I
understand it's tradition - but times have changed and it's
important to support and show respect for what women have done,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''All this legislation does is eliminate another barrier,''
McGee said.
</P>
<P>
   But Schulz maintains that a gender-neutral constitution ''will
not change anything.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The state constitution does not now prohibit or restrict women
from holding any jobs in government,'' he said, adding that making
the document's language neutral ''will not enhance anyone's
liberty, rights or freedoms.''
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman William Magnarelli, D-Onondaga and a co-sponsor of
the bill, said that changing pronouns could have an important
impact.
</P>
<P>
   ''Young men growing up, and especially young women who hold the
fate of this nation, will come up with a new perspective,''
Magnarelli said. ''My daughters will tell you it's very important.
It will say they're a part of the constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the changes proposed by McGee and Galef:
</P>
<P>
   - A phrase such as ''The lieutenant governor, he shall...''
would be changed to ''The lieutenant governor shall...''
</P>
<P>
   - The pronoun he or his would be replaced by a title. For
example, ''His pleasure...,'' would become ''The pleasure of the
chief judge....''
</P>
<P>
   - Words like ''fireman,'' ''workman'' and ''assemblyman'' would
be changed to ''firefighter,'' ''worker'' and ''Assembly member.''
</P>
<P>
   - Wherever appropriate, ''he'' would become ''he or she,'' and
''his'' would be changed to ''his or hers.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a no-brainer,'' said Bartoletti. ''This is constitutional
cleanup.''

<HEADLINE> Post-Giuliani, Hillary Clinton still can't open a gap  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Despite the departure of Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani from the closely watched U.S. Senate race in New York,
Hillary Rodham Clinton has been unable to open up a gap over the
Republican opposition, according to three independent polls.
</P>
<P>
   When Giuliani pulled out of the race on May 19 to deal with his
prostate cancer, Republican leaders put on game faces and predicted
that by late summer or early fall their new candidate, Rep. Rick
Lazio, would be running even with the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take anywhere near that long for the little-known
congressman from Long Island to become competitive. In fact, it
didn't really take any time at all.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio formally announced his candidacy on May 20. A pre-Memorial
Day poll released May 25 by the Zogby International Group had the
race a statistical dead heat with Clinton at 46 percent and Lazio
at 44 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On June 4, a poll conducted by Blum &AMP; Weprin for the New York
Daily News and cable television's New York 1 all-news channel
reported Clinton was at 46 percent and Lazio at 42 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On June 7, the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute came out
with its offering. It showed Clinton and Lazio tied, at 44 percent
each.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought he'd draw even by Labor Day. I feel badly I was off
by a full holiday - two if you count the Fourth'' of July, said
Kieran Mahoney, a New York-based GOP operative.
</P>
<P>
   While Lazio has attributes that make him an attractive candidate
in his own right - young, telegenic and eight years in Congress -
his almost instant closing of the gap with the first lady added
credence to the theory that no matter who the Republicans run
against Clinton, it will be a close race.
</P>
<P>
   ''Her high negatives don't change,'' said pollster Lee Miringoff
of Marist College's Institute for Public Opinion. ''And, apparently
that's fairly easily transferrable.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If you run against Hillary Clinton, and if you pass a fairly
low hurdle of respectability, a lot of people are going to like you
because they dislike her so much,'' said Mahoney.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest Quinnipiac poll, four in 10 voters said they had
an unfavorable opinion of Clinton. Her negatives have been running
at that level for months.
</P>
<P>
   That poll also found, however, that 58 percent of voters
surveyed didn't know enough about Lazio to form a favorable or
unfavorable opinion.
</P>
<P>
   With less than five months until the election, political
veterans say the key to the race is how Lazio gets defined for the
electorate.
</P>
<P>
   ''New Yorkers may not like her, but she's got to make them like
him less,'' said Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic strategist who has
worked on many New York campaigns and was part of President
Clinton's successful 1996 re-election campaign team.
</P>
<P>
   The Lazio camp and his allies are working hard at presenting him
as a moderate Republican in tune with mainstream New Yorkers. His
campaign bus is called ''The Mainstream Express.'' The candidate
has T-shirts emblazoned with a ''Made in New York'' logo aimed at
reminding voters that Clinton didn't even live in the state until
January. He also repeatedly stresses that he has an eight-year
record in Congress while the first lady has no record and has never
been an elected official.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, the Clinton camp argues that Lazio is a Newt
Gingrich-loving conservative who voted for most of the ''Contract
with America,'' to shut down the federal government in 1995 and to
slash funding for education and health care.
</P>
<P>
   With Lazio replacing Giuliani in the race, political veterans
are beginning to re-examine recent New York races in which a
high-profile, polarizing figure, such as Hillary Clinton, faced a
little-known, but reasonably well-funded opponent, such as Rick
Lazio. Such models include Republican George Pataki against
three-term Democratic Gov. Mario Cuomo in 1994 and Democrat Charles
Schumer vs. three-term Republican Sen. Alfonse D'Amato in 1998. In
both cases, the well-known, but polarizing figures, Cuomo and
D'Amato, respectively, lost.
</P>
<P>
   ''New York state politics teaches us a very important lesson,
which is that the candidate who becomes the issue is the candidate
who loses,'' said Sheinkopf. ''Her strategic mission is to make him
the issue.''

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton takes stage at political satire show  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - After more than seven years of enduring
barbs as first lady, Senate candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton got
her chance Saturday night to offer up zingers of her own as she
appeared at the nation's oldest continuous political gridiron show,
taking the stage with a carpetbag in hand.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just like every other New Yorker with Secret Service
protection,'' the first lady, who moved into New York in January,
told the audience of more than 500 people.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that she was already on ''my second opponent,'' Clinton
provided the audience with a slide show of home photos. They all,
including one of her as a child and another of her as an adult
meeting the Pope, showed her wearing a New York Yankees' hat.
</P>
<P>
   ''He really liked my hat,'' the first lady said of the Pope's
reaction.
</P>
<P>
   She was even wearing the hat, thanks to a digital enhancement,
during her husband's first inaugural walk down Pennsylvania Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was one of the guest speakers at the 100th annual
Legislative Correspondents Association dinner and show in Albany.
She is seeking the Senate seat being vacated this year by fellow
Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's Republican opponent, Rep. Rick Lazio of Long Island,
attended the show as well, but declined an invitation to speak.
Aides said Lazio's late entry into the race, after New York City
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani quit the campaign last month to deal with
prostate cancer, had left them with too little time to prepare for
the appearance.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. John Sweeney, a former top aide to Gov. George Pataki,
delivered the Republican response at the conclusion of the show.
Sweeney showed a video takeoff on the hit movie ''The Gladiator,''
in which Clinton was ''Statelessius'' in a fight against ''Split
Lipitus.'' In Sweeney's video, the gladiator with the split lip - a
reference to Lazio's fall in a recent parade that left him with a
fat lip - won the battle.
</P>
<P>
   Seated at the head table, Clinton and Lazio shook hands before
the show began. They spoke only briefly and sat at opposite sides
of the round table for 10.
</P>
<P>
   The $200-a-person black-tie gala raises money for charity and
attracts the movers and shakers of New York politics and
government. Among others, the crowd for Saturday night's event
included Pataki and state Comptroller H. Carl McCall, a potential
Democratic candidate for governor in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   After five years of being a guest speaker at the LCA show,
Pataki decided not to speak at this year's event.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady's turn on the stage came only after reporters
covering the state government had a chance to skewer her and other
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   The role of Hillary Clinton was played in Saturday night's show
by Karen DeWitt of the New York Public Radio Network. Clinton, who
laughed at most of the acts, didn't seem as amused when DeWitt
sang, to the tune of ''Can't Take My Mind Off of You'':
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just too crass to be true, even said I was a Jew.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll do whatever it takes,
</P>
<P>
   ''Cause my self-worth is at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   At intermission, the first lady went backstage and shook hands
with cast members. When she met DeWitt, Clinton smiled and said,
''Nice job.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore's claim that he was out of the room
during a key White House discussion of questionable fund-raising
plans because he had consumed too much ice tea and had to use the
restroom was also grist for the reporters' mill. Erik Kriss of the
Syracuse Herald-Journal/Post Standard played the role of the vice
president and sang to the tune of Kenny Rodgers' ''The Gambler:''
</P>
<P>
   ''You got to know when to wee-wee when you're the VP.
</P>
<P>
   ''Know when to leave the room and run out to the can.
</P>
<P>
   ''When subpoenas start a fallin', just tell 'em nature's callin'
</P>
<P>
   ''That's why you don't know the first thing 'bout the crooked
plans.''
</P>
<P>
   The LCA show was held at the Empire State Plaza Convention
Center adjacent to the state Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislative Correspondents Alumni Association's Walter T.
Brown award for excellence in reporting over the past year went to
Paul Ertelt of the Watertown Daily Times.

<HEADLINE> State, union agree to tentative contract long overdue  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Gov. George Pataki announced Saturday that
the state and the Public Employees Federation have agreed to a
tentative contract.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement calls for a 3-percent raise retroactive to
October, another 3 percent retroactive to April, another 3.5
percent in April and 3.5 percent more in April 2002, according to
the state. The pact would include a $500 signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   The deal still must be approved by the executive board and
members of the union that represents more than 50,000 state
workers. Those votes could take a month, PEF officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd like to thank the PEF membership, and the leaders of our
union, as well as our international unions the American Federation
of Teachers (AFT) and the Service Employees International Union
(SEIU), who stood shoulder to shoulder with us during these long
negotiations,'' said PEF President Roger E. Benson. ''This
agreement meets the unique needs of our members.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said that PEF is now expected to join the Civil Service
Employees Association to support legislation Pataki seeks to amend
the retirement law. The law change would allow for no contribution
by employees to Tier 3 and Tier 4 after 10 years of service
effective Oct. 1. It would also provide Tier 1 and Tier 2 employees
(most of the state's oldest retirees) with one month of retirement
service credit per year worked, up to 24 months.
</P>
<P>
   PEF officials said the major sticking point in negotiations
involved the use of electronic timekeeping methods.
</P>
<P>
   The new agreement would preserve the members protections against
the use of such records for disciplinary purposes, according to PEF
officials. The proposed pact also includes some changes in health
benefits, including an increase in office visit co-pays from $8 to
$10 to $12 per visit, and a reduction in the cost of generic
prescription drugs from $8 to $5. The cost for brand name
prescriptions would increase from $8 to $15. Dental benefits would
also be enhanced.
</P>
<P>
   PEF and the state have been without a contract since April 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The union represents 54,000 white-collar workers - in
professional, scientific and technical fields.

<HEADLINE> New York farmers say federal aid measures leave them out  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - Lots of apples, little worth.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, New York's apple growers say, the federal
government doesn't get it.
</P>
<P>
   The growers are hoping their state and national representatives
will be able to push through emergency legislation to help
Northeast apple farmers.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer backs the legislation, part of the
federal 2001 Agricultural Appropriations bill, as do Reps. James
Walsh, R- Onondaga, and Maurice Hinchey, D-Saugerties.
</P>
<P>
   After hail from the 1998 Labor Day storm wiped out $500,000
worth of Albion apple grower Bruce Krenning's crops, this past
fall's batch of New York apples had great volume, but too small a
size for marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't keep doing this,'' Krenning said Friday at a meeting
of farmers, agriculture officials and politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two years, Krenning said, his loss reached
$700,000.
</P>
<P>
   Existing agricultural disaster relief has been geared toward
Southern and Midwestern crops that either grow or don't, said state
Department of Agriculture Deputy Commissioner Rick Zimmerman.
</P>
<P>
   The government says, ''You still have an apple, so what's the
problem?'' Zimmerman said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is stalled in the House of Representatives. It includes
trade provisions with Cuba, which have been strongly opposed.

<HEADLINE> Author Kozol finds a refuge -- and a book -- in the downtrodden Bronx </HEADLINE>
By BETH GARDINER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Nine books and 35 years after he took up the
fight that's shaped his adult life, Jonathan Kozol was growing
weary of the outrage that had been his stock in trade.
</P>
<P>
   The crusading writer was aching for a respite from the
exhausting work of bringing the lives of the poor - especially
children - to the attention of a nation that often acts as if it
would rather ignore them.
</P>
<P>
   He turned to a seemingly unlikely refuge, a gritty, oft-maligned
neighborhood that had touched his heart once before. And the South
Bronx, whose name is shorthand for the woes of urban America,
helped restore his tired spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt at home here,'' explained Kozol, 63, whose often
searing books have chronicled the real-life impact of the gap
between rich and poor. ''I don't have children of my own, so this
was the place where I thought I had a family.''
</P>
<P>
   Kozol's hundreds of trips to the South Bronx neighborhood known
as Mott Haven - for social visits, classroom stops, religious
services and long afternoons at a church afterschool program -
began in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of the country's poorest areas, and Kozol had spent
time there before, researching his 1995 book ''Amazing Grace,'' a
wrenching account of the impact of poverty, violence, disease and
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   This time, though, he was looking for more than just the makings
of a book - although he eventually got that too. Worn down by the
pressures of writing and advocacy and saddened by the illness of
his elderly parents, the Harvard-educated writer sought solace amid
a network of poor black and Hispanic children, most of them still
in elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   ''I kept coming back here when I was feeling low,'' he
explained. ''The children would always cheer me up and comfort me
if they could see I was upset.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every book I've written up until now has had an agenda,''
Kozol continued, recalling works on homelessness, educational
inequality and illiteracy. ''When a writer has a specific agenda,
the whimsical and unpredictable things that children say become
distractions. ... This time, I wanted to enjoy the interruptions.''
</P>
<P>
   Kozol smiles when he speaks of the small, sweet ideas that
occupy the minds of the young children, largely the same in the
South Bronx as they are in wealthier places - things like crayons,
birthdays, pets, baby brothers.
</P>
<P>
   The innocence he saw in the schoolchildren of this troubled
neighborhood is central to ''Ordinary Resurrections,'' the book
that came out of the visits that weren't expected to lead to a
book.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most of Kozol's earlier works, ''Ordinary Resurrections''
is highly personal, filled with vivid descriptions of children's
lives and personalities and of the friendships he formed with them.
</P>
<P>
   While books like ''Death at an Early Age,'' ''Savage
Inequalities,'' and ''Amazing Grace'' exposed some of the ugliest
parts of American life, ''Ordinary Resurrections'' finds beauty
even in a neighborhood filled with sadness.
</P>
<P>
   Kozol describes small encounters over the hundreds of hours he
spent at St. Ann's Church, an inviting stone building where
neighborhood children play, do homework and munch snacks after
school. He also made frequent visits to nearby P.S. 30, a public
school that thrives - despite many obstacles - thanks to the work
of a devoted principal.
</P>
<P>
   The children Kozol meets ask to see pictures of his dog, make
bracelets from jelly beans and describe their ideas about God and
heaven. While some may worry about fathers in prison or go home to
mothers who don't have money for food, they are still children,
playful, curious and loving.
</P>
<P>
   ''St. Ann's is not a place of sorrow, but ... of irresistible
vitality and energy and sometimes complicated hope, and now and
then uncomplicated joy,'' Kozol writes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ordinary Resurrections'' clearly reflects his fascination with
children, and the joy he takes in observing the quirks that make
each one unique. But Kozol's new focus on life's softer elements
doesn't mean his passion for political and social change has
diminished.
</P>
<P>
   By introducing readers to youngsters like inquisitive, exuberant
Elio and self-assured Pineapple, he hopes to inspire outrage about
the poverty they live in and the inferior, underfunded schools they
attend.
</P>
<P>
   Kozol recalls one reader who suggested that ''in a way, it's my
most political book, because I don't speak politically, but the
narrative leads a reader to inevitable political conclusions. I
hope that's true.''
</P>
<P>
   A slight man in a rumpled suit and scuffed shoes, Kozol burst
with excited energy as he chatted recently with teachers and
administrators on a recent visit to P.S. 30, and seemed happiest
with children tugging at his sleeves.
</P>
<P>
   But ask him about the social and economic forces that may limit
his young Bronx friends, and he responds with an outrage that's
gone out of fashion since he was a young Boston teacher in the
1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Kozol points to schools that are 99.8 percent black and Hispanic
and spend about $5,000 per year for each student. He calls these
''academies of apartheid,'' comparing them to schools in wealthy
towns that spend as much as $18,000 per child.
</P>
<P>
   ''School inequality ought to be the easiest issue for a rich
democracy to resolve,'' Kozol says, leaning in over a table at a
coffee shop around the corner from St. Ann's. ''This country is
rich enough to give every child in the South Bronx the kind of
education it's giving to children in the richest suburbs and not
take a dollar away from the suburbs.''
</P>
<P>
   Although neighborhoods like the South Bronx are benefiting from
a recent drop in crime, the economic boom has hardly been felt in
the area served by St. Ann's, where Kozol says unemployment is
still more than 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   After more than three decades of writing angry books, delivering
impassioned lectures and testifying before Congress on poverty and
school inequality, he sometimes wonders what his life's work has
really accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's heartbreaking after 35 years to see public schools that
are more separate and less equal than they were when I started
out,'' he said. ''There is a sense of futility about doing this and
seeing so little change.''

<HEADLINE> Cirque du Soleil topples the big-top tradition  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK
Associated Press Writer
With AP Photos NYR108-109-110 June 7
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Invoke. Provoke. Evoke.
</P>
<P>
   That's the motto of the Cirque du Soleil, whose avant-garde
clowns and acrobats have toppled the cliche of the big-top circus.
</P>
<P>
   One performer pops up in the air above the Nevada desert,
barechested in a gyrating cube that's consumed by flames. Suddenly,
he rises above the fire - a phoenix captured on film.
</P>
<P>
   It's a scene from the most bold incarnation yet of the
Canadian-based circus - a new IMAX 3D film, the 38-minute ''Journey
of Man'', which shows the odyssey of life through a circus that has
moved from the tent to spectacular natural scenes around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The screen production mirrors the Cirque du Soleil, meaning
Circus of the Sun, founded in 1984 in Quebec. It now has more than
500 performers who offer artistic acrobatics that break the old
pattern of elephants, sawdust and peanuts.
</P>
<P>
   A trailblazer among the new ''boutique'' circus acts, Cirque
draws an upscale audience that pays as much as $100 a ticket for a
live show, its seven troupes playing everywhere from Las Vegas to
Asia and Europe. One of them even puts on a dragon-and-lion,
East-meets-West evening with a special VIP package including
champagne and appetizers.
</P>
<P>
   But the IMAX version is for both adults and kids, at the
democratic price of a movie ticket.
</P>
<P>
   It starts with a ''Big Bang,'' an explosion of light and sound
that represents birth, followed by an underwater spectacle of
synchronized swimmers shot in the Bahamas. In the theater, bubbles
seemingly float from the giant screen into the audience via the
special 3D glasses handed to each spectator.
</P>
<P>
   Although the film is narrated by British actor Ian McKellen,
''it works without narration, it works on an extremely visual
level,'' says producer and writer Peter Wagg. ''You don't have to
explain - the cave is a womb, the birth canal is coming through the
water. It's all symbolic imagery.''
</P>
<P>
   Then a boy tumbles through a redwood forest filled with birdlike
creatures whose fantastic aerial leaps on bungee cords are his
taste of freedom. He's accompanied by two clowns representing his
instincts, in a tug-of-war between fear and curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   ''The creatures of the forest are all around you, and you'll
hear them walking through the theater,'' says director Keith
Melton. ''You are literally a part of this movie, because you just
get sucked into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds simple. But it took somewhere between $10 million and $20
million - Melton won't divulge the exact figure - to engineer this
film teeming with sights and sounds. Producers enhanced and mixed
natural sounds with digital ones using synthesizers at a California
studio. ''We wanted to put surreal elements in the real world,''
says Melton.
</P>
<P>
   Even for two pros, it was a thrill.
</P>
<P>
   When Wagg and Melton first heard the soundtrack, ''we literally
held hands!'' says Wagg, laughing and grabbing Melton's hand again
as they sit for an interview at the Sony IMAX Theatre near Lincoln
Center.
</P>
<P>
   The high-tech effects serve a higher, human agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Vachon, who plays one of the two clowns guiding boy, says
the film shows viewers that boys are little human beings. ''Even if
they are very small ... they take initiatives,'' says Vachon, whose
wife, Josette Dechene, plays the other clown symbolizing the boy's
instincts.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must never think that we are superior to kids,'' adds
Vachon, his face half made up for the clown mask as he sits in
jeans before the film's U.S. premiere at the theater.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the boy reaches manhood, discovering love in a 17th
century garden - a scene shot at a California estate where statues
of a man and a woman come to life on a lily pad, in a virtuosic,
gravity-defying dance. The cameras zero in on each muscle and fold
of their bare skin - and even the slight trembling that went with
the effort. The water was dyed black to produce a reflection, and
the lily pad was made rock solid.
</P>
<P>
   ''These performers are really doing what you're seeing. It's not
a special effect, it's not a cinematic trick,'' says Melton. ''That
is the core magic of Cirque.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's not all pretty.
</P>
<P>
   Having discovered love, the protagonist is led astray by the
demon-like Stiltman, tempting him with wealth that leaves him
feeling empty amid marble splendor. ''There's no family, no love,
no life,'' says Melton.
</P>
<P>
   He's eventually saved by a vagabond girl who brings back the old
bowler hat he had given up for a golden one.
</P>
<P>
   The characters' final stop is Berlin's historic Brandenberg
Gate, which once marked the division of East and West, and is a
symbol of new beginnings.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, this story aimed at family audiences exudes a certain
pie-in-the-sky idealism.
</P>
<P>
   But ''there are not a lot of family-oriented films that
emphasize these really important values - and that don't make kids
turn off,'' says Melton.
</P>
<P>
   He says the show, which runs in New York through September and
is being shown at IMAX theaters worldwide, makes an emotional
journey that shows off ''the idea of the human spirit, of how
spectacular the potential of the human body and spirit is.''
</P>
<P>
   Accompanying the story is a teacher's guide for children taken
to see the film.
</P>
<P>
   It's all part of the ''mission statement'' of the Cirque:
''Invoke, provoke and evoke the imagination, the senses and the
emotions of people around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   And in this film - with the fiery scene over the Nevada desert
and a dream-sequence flight into the Grand Canyon - the circus
truly provokes nerves.

<HEADLINE> Federal probe ordered into Buffalo-area rail problems  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUFFALO, N.Y.(AP) - Federal officials gave the two companies
controlling Buffalo-area rail transport 90 days to offer a solution
to service problems said to be crippling local industry.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Surface Transportation Board, responding to a request
from Rep. Jack Quinn, R-Hamburg, ordered CSX Corp. and Norfolk
Southern railroads to ''meet with shippers,railroads, and other
interested parties'' to propose solutions, estimate costs and offer
a timetable for improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn said he hoped the order would result in better movement of
goods in and out of the region, ''allowing our economy to grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Corporations with plants in western New York say CSX's ongoing
computer problems mean cars going over their rails en route to
Norfolk Southern lines are bumped back and forth and getting lost.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, they criticize Norfolk Southern for lacking adequate
local track space.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Paul Tokasz, D-Cheektowaga, said the state
Legislature is poised to pass $35 million in railroad property tax
relief over five years. In exchange, Tokasz said, the railroads
would be expected to make investments in area infrastructure such
as a new draw bridge over the Buffalo River and an intermodal
rail-truck transfer point.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Sullivan, spokesman for CSX, said the company plans to spend
$65 million through 2003 in New York State, with nearly a quarter
of the money going to the Buffalo area.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Norfolk Southern, Ron Husband, said his company
continues to support construction of a new rail span across the
Buffalo River, but cautioned ''we have not made any firm financial
commitment yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The state has informally committed spending $10 million to
building a replacement for the closed CP Draw bridge.
</P>
<P>
   CSX Corp. and the rail unit of rival Norfolk Southern Corp. have
been troubled by service and safety problems - as well as
plummeting stock prices - resulting from their June 1, 1999 breakup
of Conrail Inc., the Philadelphia-based freight railroad.
</P>
<P>
   In April, CSX President Ronald Conway was removed by John W.
Snow, chairman and chief executive of the company, who took the
helm of the $10.8 billion company's rail unit himself.
</P>
<P>
   Conway seemed to underestimate the challenges of taking over
CSX's 42 percent of Conrail. Last fall, he told analysts CSX had
resolved its Conrail breakup problems and was ready to reap the
benefits of serving the key Northeastern markets it gained. But at
a January forum in Philadelphia, 300 shippers protested that
breakup problems persisted.
</P>
<P>
   Shippers have also expressed outrage over service delays and
disruptions since the 1996 Union Pacific-Southern Pacific merger.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints led the transportation board to approve a moratorium
on new rail mergers in March.

<HEADLINE> Chechens Attack Russian Positions  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- Rebel fighters attacked Russian military
positions in Chechnya more than 20 times overnight, including 11
assaults on federal installations in the capital, Grozny, officials
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The latest wave of attacks was one of the most intense yet, as
the rebels step up their activities across the breakaway republic
on Russia's southern border.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Interior Ministry's department for Chechnya,
rebels opened fire on at least 20 federal checkpoints. There were
no Russian fatalities, but one soldier was wounded in Gudermes when
rebels fired at a checkpoint on a bridge across the Sunzha River, a
ministry spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal troops detained 20 Chechen rebels in a special operation
in the southwestern village of Urus-Martan, the military command's
news center said Sunday. The troops seized six assault rifles,
three pistols, two grenades and a bomb during the operation
Saturday, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   In other operations, federal forces destroyed four rebel bases,
the spokesman said. Three assault rifles, a flame-thrower, five
grenade launchers and 34 hand grenades were seized. There was no
way to verify any of the reports.
</P>
<P>
   Russian authorities are now concentrating on seeking a long-term
political solution in Chechnya, President Vladimir Putin said in an
interview with the German newspaper Welt am Sonntag, published
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''With large-scale fighting over, efforts are now being
concentrated on the prevention of sabotage and finding and
eliminating gang leaders,'' Putin said. ''These activities will
continue until all sources of terrorism are eliminated.''
</P>
<P>
   Chechnya's rebel president, Aslan Maskhadov, wants Malaysia's
premier to help mediate negotiations on resolving the conflict,
Malaysia's Bernama news agency reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would be very grateful to the Malaysian prime minister,
Mahathir Mohamad, if he could bring Chechnya and Russia to start
the negotiating process,'' the agency quoted him as saying.
Maskhadov's statement was sent to the news agency through
Maskhadov's son, a student in Malaysia, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has said it will not negotiate with the rebels, calling
them terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian offensive against Chechnya, which began in late
September, has stalled for months in the rugged southern mountains.
The rebels have kept up ambushes and bombings in the northern
lowlands, steadily inflicting losses on Russian forces and sapping
troop morale.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians were driven out of Chechnya in a 1994-96 war. They
re-entered in September after Islamic militants based there seized
several villages in the neighboring Russian region of Dagestan, and
after about 300 people died in apartment bombings the government
blamed on Chechens.

   HAVANA (AP) -- Some 150,000 children and teen-agers will protest
Elian Gonzalez's extended stay in the United States, the Cuban
government said Sunday, after the procession was canceled last week
due to rain.
</P>
<P>
   The cartoon character Elpidio Valdes -- a mustachioed freedom
fighter fashioned after the warriors of Cuba's battle for
independence -- appeared in spots on state television encouraging
children to participate.
</P>
<P>
   The communist government had convoked 150,000 schoolchildren and
teen-agers for the march Monday morning in front of the U.S.
Interests Section, the American mission here. Children were already
arriving in buses Friday when the government called off the event
as a light rain began to fall.
</P>
<P>
   If rain again disrupts Monday's march, it will be postponed
until Tuesday or Wednesday, President Fidel Castro said.
</P>
<P>
   The government on June 2 called out a half-million women for a
march outside the seaside Interests Section -- one of the largest
protests since Elian's international custody battle began more than
six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was rescued off the coast of Florida in November, after
his mother and 10 others perished in a sea journey to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, a federal appellate court in Atlanta sided with
Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, who says only he has the
right to speak for his son. The boy's Miami relatives had been
seeking a political asylum hearing for the child.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, who was reunited with Elian on April 22, said he
wanted to return with his son to Cuba. But under a timetable
outlined by Attorney General Janet Reno, Elian would not be able to
leave the United States until June 21, to give his Miami relatives
a chance to appeal the latest ruling.

<HEADLINE> Norway Envoy Dies in Yemen Shootout  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSLO, Norway (AP) -- A gunfight between Yemeni police and four
armed kidnappers left a Norweigian diplomat dead, just hours after
he and his young son were taken hostage in the Middle Eastern
country, Norway's Foreign Ministry said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Gudbrand Stuve, 44, was shot in the gunfight that erupted
Saturday after his four captors were stopped at a police
checkpoint, a ministry spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It turned into a shootout between the kidnappers and the
police, and Stuve was hit,'' spokesman Bjoern Berge said. ''He died
a short while later.'' Stuve's nine-year-old son was not injured.
</P>
<P>
   The ministry said there were unconfirmed reports that one of the
kidnappers was killed and the three others escaped.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Yemen, an impoverished country on the tip of the
Arabian peninsula, could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Stuve and his son were kidnapped when they went to a repair shop
in Yemen's capital, San'a. Stuve's wife alerted police, and about
two hours later, police stopped the four kidnappers and their
hostages on the outskirts of the city, according to the Norwegian
foreign ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Stuve, a veterinarian, had just a just completed a four-year
assignment as a diplomatic secretary at the Norwegian Embassy in
Lusaka, Zambia. He and his family were touring parts of Africa and
the Middle East by car before returning to Norway.
</P>
<P>
   The motive for the kidnapping was not immediately known.
</P>
<P>
   Large parts of Yemen are lawless, inhabited by tribes that often
kidnap foreigners or use firearms to settle scores with rivals or
express discontent with the government.
</P>
<P>
   Berge said Norway would do everything in its power to see the
kidnappers brought to justice
</P>
<P>
   ''I am shaken by this tragic incident,'' Foreign Minister
Thorbjoern Jagland was quoted as telling the Norwegian news agency
NTB.

<HEADLINE> Report: Southern states source of guns used in out-of-state crimes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Nearly one in four guns used in out-of-state
crimes committed nationwide last year came from four Southern
states with weak gun laws, according to a report released Sunday by
U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer.
</P>
<P>
   Florida, Georgia, Mississippi and Texas are the top culprits,
said Schumer, citing the report, ''War Between the States,'' which
documents the flow of crime-linked guns.
</P>
<P>
   ''A vast network of gun runners use our highways like firearms
freeways to traffic illegal guns to criminals,'' the New York
Democrat said in a news release. ''Nowehere is the impact felt
greater than in New York where Southern guns inundate New York
streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Using data obtained from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms, the study shows that gun runners funneled thousands
of weapons to criminals in the Northeast and Midwest states where
laws are stricter.
</P>
<P>
   Out of a nationwide total of 30,453 out-of-state gun traces,
Florida, Georgia, Mississippi and Texas were the source of 7,494,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   New York is among the leading states victimized by gun-running
from Southern states. For instance, 1,685 guns used in local crimes
last year originated in Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas and
Virginia, while only 61 guns used in those states were first sold
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''A Georgia criminal using a New York gun is a rarity. A New
York criminal using a Georgie gun is commonplace,'' Schumer said.
</P>
<P>
   The senator has introduced a bill that would increase funding
for ATF agents, give law enforcement greater authority to
investigate gun dealers and require all gun manufacturers to file
ballistics DNA with law enforcement authorities. He also is backing
legislation to license and register handguns and limit purchases to
one per month.

<HEADLINE> China Official Begins Belgrade Talks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The second-most powerful figure in
the Chinese Communist Party began a three-day visit to Belgrade on
Sunday, aiming to expand cooperation between Beijing and the Balkan
nation now isolated by the West.
</P>
<P>
   Li Peng, a former prime minister and now head of the Chinese
legislature, was greeted at Belgrade airport by a group of Yugoslav
officials, including a vice-premier, army commanders, the foreign
minister and the speakers of both parliamentary chambers.
</P>
<P>
   Li and a delegation of political and business leaders from
Beijing were expected to hold meetings with Yugoslav officials to
''broaden continuing cooperation, solidarity and mutual respect,''
Yugoslav state media said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am very happy to visit Yugoslavia. There is a tradition of
friendship between Yugoslavia and China which will be further
improved by this visit,'' Li said at the red-carpet welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Li was also expected to meet President Slobodan Milosevic, whose
policies have led Western countries to consider Yugoslavia a pariah
state. Yugoslavia is under Western sanctions for Milosevic's brutal
policies in the southern republic of Kosovo, for which he also has
been indicted by a U.N. war crimes tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   Li is to deliver a speech to the federal parliament Monday
before finishing the first stop in his European tour. Li is also
expected to visit Slovakia, Croatia, Slovenia, Azerbaijan and
Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   China and Russia are among the few countries that maintain close
ties with Milosevic's government after NATO's military intervention
in Kosovo last year.
</P>
<P>
   China opposed NATO's 78-day bombing campaign, during which the
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade was accidentally hit, killing three
Chinese citizens and damaging U.S.-China relations. China,
meanwhile, reportedly granted Yugoslavia a $3 billion loan.

<HEADLINE> 'Gone in 60 Seconds' Tops Box Office  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The car-heist caper ''Gone in 60 Seconds''
raced to the top of the weekend box office, debuting with $25.5
million and pushing ''Mission: Impossible 2'' back into the pack,
according to studio estimates Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gone in 60 Seconds'' overcame generally poor reviews that said
the action flick squandered the talents of Oscar-winning stars
Nicolas Cage, Angelina Jolie and Robert Duvall. It was produced by
action master Jerry Bruckheimer.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bad reviews don't matter,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, president
of Exhibitor Relations, which tracks the box office. ''People are
looking for escape in the summer. The movie's trailers promised
some fun, so audiences went out to theaters to escape.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Gone in 60 Seconds'' likely will be gone from the top spot
next weekend, when Samuel L. Jackson's update of the 1970s
detective franchise ''Shaft'' debuts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mission'' fell to No. 2 after two weekends in first place,
grossing $17.1 million to push its total to $157.9 million since
opening just before Memorial Day. It passed ''Gladiator,'' which
has taken in $150.2 million, as the top-grossing flick so far this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Big Momma's House'' was third in its second weekend, taking in
$16.8 million. The Martin Lawrence comedy had grossed $52 million
in 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   In its fourth weekend, ''Dinosaur'' took in $8.8 million and
increased its total gross to $110.5 million, making it the fourth
movie released this year to top $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Two new movies did well in limited release.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sunshine,'' starring Ralph Fiennes in a saga that follows
three generations of a Hungarian-Jewish family, debuted with
$92,583 in seven theaters. The movie had a strong $13,226
per-cinema average, compared to $8,483 in 3,006 theaters for ''Gone
in 60 Seconds.'' ''Sunshine'' expands to more theaters in late
June.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Branagh's latest Shakespeare adaptation, a tuneful
version of ''Love's Labour's Lost'' updated as a 1930s Hollywood
musical, opened in two theaters with $27,000 for a $13,500 average.
</P>
<P>
   Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at North
American theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final
figures are to be released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   1. ''Gone in 60 Seconds,'' $25.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   2. ''Mission: Impossible 2,'' $17.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   3. ''Big Momma's House,'' $16.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   4. ''Dinosaur,'' $8.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   5. ''Gladiator,'' $7.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   6. ''Shanghai Noon,'' $5.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   7. ''Road Trip,'' $4.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   8. ''Frequency,'' $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   9. ''Small Time Crooks,'' $1.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   10. ''U-571,'' $1.1 million.

<HEADLINE> Arabs Mourn Syrian Leader  </HEADLINE>
By MAUREEN JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   Israel viewed with trepidation Sunday a new power vacuum in the
Middle East, Arab states went into mourning, while Europeans and
Asians paid tributes -- many fulsome -- to Syria's dead president.
Britain welcomed the prospect of his son taking over.
</P>
<P>
   In many Arab states, flags flew at half-staff and leaders
declared official periods of mourning.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak devoted a special Cabinet
meeting Sunday to events in Syria, in part out of concern that
Syrian stability could be at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Assad, 69, died Saturday after 30 years in power. On Sunday,
Syria's ruling Baath Party gave its presidential nomination to
Assad's son Bashar Assad, a 34-year-old eye doctor, who was being
groomed for office.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's very impressive ... I think he would be very good news
for the Syrian people and very good news for the peace process,''
said British Foreign Office Minister Peter Hain in an interview
with Britain's GMTV. ''But that doesn't mean to say he would be a
pushover in the peace negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   Assad was credited with bringing stability to Syria. He also
entered peace talks with Israel, and had joined the U.S.-led
coalition against longtime rival Iraq during the 1990-91 Gulf
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Peace talks broke down in January over a sliver of land by the
Sea of Galilee and the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from
Syria during the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak at a Cabinet meeting Sunday
declared that Assad's death meant ''the end of an era.''
</P>
<P>
   ''... We are standing before another Middle East that we will
have to study,'' he said, according to his office.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, who spoke with President Clinton, Egypt's Mubarak and
Jordan's King Abudullah II on Saturday, had issued a carefully
worded official statement Saturday saying his government
''understands the sorrow of the Syrian people.''
</P>
<P>
   However, former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir bluntly
denounced Assad, saying the Syrian leader's only real success was
maintaining power and stability, which he did ''through brutal,
merciless means.''
</P>
<P>
   ''While the death of a man after a long illness should never
provoke joy, neither can I say that the news makes me sad,'' Shamir
was quoted as saying in an interview with an Italian newspaper, La
Repubblica.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton on Saturday praised Assad for making ''a strategic
choice for peace'' at a 1991 conference in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had our differences, but I always respected him, '' Clinton
added.
</P>
<P>
   Tributes Sunday were less equivocal.
</P>
<P>
   Austrian President Thomas Klestil said Assad was totally
committed to peace, adding, ''I knew him as a great Arab statesman
and a warmhearted man full of humor.'' German President Gerhard
Schroeder said Assad was a key influence in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   In France, which is the former colonial ruler of Syria and which
seeks a central role in Middle East peacemaking, Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin said he felt ''great emotion.''
</P>
<P>
   China mourned a ''respected friend,'' and Japan said Assad's
death was ''more regrettable'' because of hopes for peace.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Russian President Vladimir Putin lauded Assad as ''a
friend of our country.'' But it was unclear whether Putin would
interrupt a planned visit to Spain to attend the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II sent condolences to the people of Syria,
saying God could help them follow the way toward peace ''for the
good of all Syrians and all inhabitants of the region.''
</P>
<P>
   In Lebanon, where Syria has been an unquestioned power since its
soldiers moved in during the 1975-90 civil war, Prime Minister
Salim Hoss said Saturday Assad's death had ''struck Lebanon in the
heart.''

<HEADLINE> Heroin resurges among teen-agers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) - Leigh was 16 the first time she stole a
syringe from her grandfather, a doctor, to experiment with heroin.
Lucinda was also 16, and read up on the dangers of the drug before
trying it to feel ''normal'' and lose weight.
</P>
<P>
   They came from good families in the suburbs. There were no
traumas in their lives, no abuse. Their friends didn't use heroin.
</P>
<P>
   Drug counselors say their stories are not unusual. Young people
have reported using the drug to help focus on schoolwork or sports,
or just because it was available at parties and clubs.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in heroin use among teen-agers has been blamed, in
part, on the increased purity of the drug, which allows users to
snort or smoke it, police and drug counselors say. The drug has
become more socially acceptable and easier to use.
</P>
<P>
   ''The history of methadone programs was that you had to be 21 to
get in, which wasn't a problem because clients, on average, were in
their 30s,'' said John Hamilton of programs based in Stamford.
''But now we're getting a lot of 18- and 19-year-olds with three-
or four-year histories of heroin use.''
</P>
<P>
   Drug counselors say that alcohol, marijuana and amphetamines are
still the drugs of choice among most preteens and teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   But about 80,000 12- to 17-year-olds and 303,000 18- to
25-year-olds admitted using heroin in 1998, according to a survey
by the U.S. Office of National Drug Policy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, the average age of someone trying heroin for the first
time was 26.5 years old, according to the Drug Enforcement
Administration. In 1999, the typical first-time user was 17.5 years
old.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the statistics, Lucinda and Leigh, whose names have
been changed, closely fit the current profile of addicts.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was raised right, treated well,'' said Lucinda, now 19.
''I'm just like everyone else, except I got into heroin.''
</P>
<P>
   And as long as she had the drug she could go to school, run
errands and attend family functions.
</P>
<P>
   Leigh, too, was raised in a good family, she said. No one
noticed that she had drained several thousand dollars from her
savings account to pay for the drugs. The account, along with a
part-time job at a library, helped her spend several hundred
dollars a week on heroin.
</P>
<P>
   Both women ended up at methadone treatment clinics, where
addicts get a dose of the synthetic opiate to prevent withdrawals
while being weaned from heroin. For Lucinda, it was a last resort
after rehab, detox and Narcotics Anonymous meetings. Leigh needed
treatment after checking into and getting kicked out of several
rehab centers across the country.
</P>
<P>
   A common denominator that led the women to the drug was the
desire to feel good. Leigh had suffered with depression as long as
she could remember. Lucinda was an insomniac who had trouble
concentrating.
</P>
<P>
   The desire to feel normal and the ability to do so with the help
of heroin is often expressed by addicts, said Dr. Charles Morgan, a
psychiatrist who works with drug addicts at Norwalk Hospital's
substance abuse program.
</P>
<P>
   ''But once they become physically dependent, it changes their
focus then becomes getting the drug to avoid becoming sick,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Leigh is working full time at a job she's not happy with and
living at home with a mother who doesn't know that she relapsed
last year. She hopes to get a job as a graphic artist, a field in
which she was working when heroin consumed her life.
</P>
<P>
   Lucinda isn't working now and isn't sure what she wants to do.
For now, she and her counselor agreed, she has to direct all her
attention to not using heroin.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have every intention of living a full, productive, normal
lifestyle,'' she said. ''Before, I thought my destiny was to be on
the streets forever. Now, I actually think I can be something.''

<HEADLINE> Little Orphan Annie Gets a Makeover  </HEADLINE>
By JUDIE GLAVE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Gone are the red dress and unruly curls. With
her platform sneakers, jeans and slicked-back hair, the comic strip
version of Little Orphan Annie is now, in the lexicon of her
11-year-old modern peers -- mad sick.
</P>
<P>
   Translation: Leapin' Lizards! America's favorite orphan has
gotten a makeover and is suddenly cool.
</P>
<P>
   Her new do and duds were introduced last week when artist Andrew
Pepoy and writer Jay Maeder officially took over from longtime
''Annie'' cartoonist Leonard Starr, who retired in February.
</P>
<P>
   Pepoy, a freelance cartoonist who has drawn for Mutant X, Sonic
the Hedgehog, Scooby-Doo and Archie comics, said both he and
Tribune Media Services, the Chicago-based company that syndicates
the 75-year-old strip, thought Annie looked dated next to her new
friend, the edgy Hispanic aviator Amelia Santiago. A few pencil
strokes later, out went Annie's tired old red dress, black
Maryjanes and ankle socks; in came jeans, a red T-shirt and
platform sneakers.
</P>
<P>
   Her hair is different, too, the mop of red curls sleeked down
with gel and adorned with two mismatched barrettes.
</P>
<P>
   But fans of America's favorite blank-eyed youngster -- yes, she's
still pupil-less -- shouldn't worry.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there's some kind of feeling out there that Little Orphan
Annie is now a typical 11-year-old who goes to rock concerts and
has pictures of 'N Sync on her wall, no, this is not happening,''
said writer Maeder. ''In fact, if you ask me what kind of music
she'd listen to, I'd say Tommy Dorsey.''
</P>
<P>
   The 53-year-old Maeder, a journalist for the New York Daily News
and a comic historian, downplayed the makeover.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't changed her fundamental character in any way. Anyone
who ever loved Little Orphan Annie will not look at this and say
this is a totally different person.''
</P>
<P>
   Maeder says he has no plans to turn Annie or any other character
into a valley girl. She'll still exclaim, ''Leapin' Lizards,'' and
Sandy will still say, ''Arf,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Created by Harold Gray, the strip first appeared in the Daily
News, Aug. 5, 1924. Annie is said to have been inspired by silent
screen star Mary Pickford. During Gray's four-decade reign -- he
died in 1968 -- Annie and her millionaire guardian Daddy Warbucks
battled everything from big government during the Depression to
Communism in the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Starr took over the strip in 1979 -- after interest in it was
revived by the Broadway musical ''Annie.''
</P>
<P>
   In the updated version, Even Warbucks has a new look. He has
lost his perennial penguin suit and will be seen in stylish,
tie-less suits, sweaters and (Yikes!) even shorts.
</P>
<P>
   And what will become of Sandy, Annie's shaggy companion?
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry, loyal readers. ''The dog never goes away,'' says
Maeder.

<HEADLINE> Mideast Talks To Resume on Schedule  </HEADLINE>
By SAMAR ASSAD
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israeli and Palestinian negotiators left Sunday
for peace treaty talks in Washington, despite the uncertainty cast
over the Middle East by Syrian President Hafez Assad's death.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians for the first time can expect Israel's
undivided attention, since a resumption of Israeli-Syrian talks in
the near future is very unlikely. Assad's successor, apparently his
son Bashar, will need time to consolidate his rule.
</P>
<P>
   The expected delay in the Israeli-Syrian talks is ''beneficial
for the Palestinians since they have an opportunity to finish (a
treaty with Israel) before the Syrians,'' said Palestinian
commentator Ghassan Khatib.
</P>
<P>
   When talks on both tracks were proceeding simultaneously last
winter, the Palestinians were worried that Israel would play one
Arab partner against the other to extract concessions on both.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Justice Minister Yossi Beilin said Sunday that Assad's
death could give Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat more freedom in
the negotiations. In the past, Assad has been sharply critical of
Arafat for negotiating a separate peace with Israel. Several
Palestinian groups opposed to peace with Israel are based in Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Beilin suggested that Assad's successor might not have the same
clout in the Arab world as the late Syrian president. ''I don't
exclude the possibility that in the future the Palestinians will
not see the Syrians as those who legitimize their acts and they may
feel free to negotiate the permanent solution with us,'' Beilin
said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the transition
period in Syria would have little effect on the Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations. The main issue, he said, was Israel's refusal to
implement U.N. resolutions 242 and 338, which call for an Israeli
withdrawal from land it captured in the 1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians hope to establish a state in these areas -- the
West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope in our talks in Washington, maximum efforts will be
extended in order to achieve decisions by Israel,'' Erekat said.
</P>
<P>
   Erekat and other negotiators left the region on Sunday, and
talks were scheduled to resume Monday at an undisclosed location in
or near Washington. President Clinton's Mideast envoy, Dennis Ross,
was to participate in the talks.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat was to meet with
Clinton at the White House. Arafat aides say no change has been
made on that meeting due to Assad's death.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian-Syrian ties have been strained for many years,
although Arafat planned to attend Assad's funeral Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Erekat suggested that the Palestinians regarded the new regime
as presenting an opportunity for the Syrians and the Palestinians
to coordinate negotiations with Israel, instead of allowing the
Israelis to play one side off the other.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is much at this stage to coordinate ... to improve the
situation on both sides,'' Erekat told Associated Press Television
News.
</P>
<P>
   The United States was to be represented by U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright. No Israeli leader would countenance even
asking to attend a funeral in an enemy state, although some Arab
residents of the disputed Golan Heights said they hoped to send a
delegation.
</P>
<P>
   Israel and the Palestinians have made little progress in their
negotiations. A treaty framework, which would outline a solution
for the four main problems -- borders, Jerusalem, Palestinian
refugees, Jewish settlements -- still appears out of reach. A final
peace treaty is due Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Erekat said Sunday that the Palestinians have reached an
understanding with Israel that once a framework treaty is signed,
1,650 Palestinian security prisoners in Israeli jails, including
about 1,000 Islamic militants, would be freed.
</P>
<P>
   Beilin said the fate of the prisoners is still being negotiated,
but that once the conflict is over, ''the issue of the prisoners
will have to be dealt with differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak cautioned over the weekend
that a complete agreement with the Palestinians may not be possible
by September.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we don't reach a (final peace deal), we will make a deal
that is almost complete,'' Barak told Israel radio. He added that
other issues would be resolved within an agreed-upon timeframe with
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat declared a three-day mourning period in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, but Assad's death was met with mixed emotions by the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Syrian troops fought against the PLO in Lebanon's civil war in
an attempt to destroy Arafat. Assad never agreed with Arafat's
negotiating style with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   A low point came last year when Syrian Defense Minister Mustafa
Tlass called Arafat a ''son of 60,000 whores.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Throughout the years he has taken the hard line against us,''
said Hiyam Nassereldin, a 45-year-old math teacher from Hebron.
''His defense minister, when he attacked our president, he was not
speaking for himself but for Assad.''
</P>
<P>
   Salman Qassem, a 28-year-old Palestinian from Jerusalem, said
Assad deserved respect for insisting on regaining all the land
Syria lost to Israel in the 1967 war. ''That was his good point and
I hope to God, Bashar will follow his father,'' Qassem said.

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leoneans Caught in Cross Fire  </HEADLINE>
By GLENN McKENZIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Leaflets exhorting Sierra Leone's
feared rebels to lay down their arms fluttered from the sky on a
cloudy day in an interior town just moments before a helicopter
gunship rained bombs on rebels and civilians alike.
</P>
<P>
   Pushing to contain a rebel menace that has left tens of
thousands dead and many more intentionally maimed in nearly nine
years of civil war, Sierra Leone's British-backed government is
launching an offensive that combines propaganda with raw force.
</P>
<P>
   Yet since Sierra Leone's war was reignited in early May, many
civilians have been caught in the cross fire, including some killed
through a combination of carelessness and neglect by the same
government forces trying to protect them, witnesses and aid workers
say.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of people have fled fighting between erratic,
undisciplined pro-government soldiers and militiamen and
Revolutionary United Front rebels who have gained notoriety for
chopping off the hands, legs, ears and lips of thousands of men,
women and children in a bid to gain influence through fear.
</P>
<P>
   They have also raped and looted on a massive scale almost
wherever they go. While government forces have also committed
scattered abuses, human rights workers and the U.N. agree that the
scale of rebel atrocities cannot be compared.
</P>
<P>
   The latest civilian exodus, relief officials with the Red Cross
and Doctors Without Borders say, is from the central rebel-held
town of Makeni, 80 miles east of Freetown, where Sierra Leonean
military attack choppers have conducted a series of deadly bombing
raids.
</P>
<P>
   During the first government bombardment on May 29, a chopper
dropped pamphlets warning the rebel Revolutionary Front: ''this
time we've dropped leaflets. Next time it will be a half-inch
Gatling machine gun or 57 millimeter rockets ... or ALL OF THEM!''
</P>
<P>
   Other papers showed pictures of elderly people and babies with
chopped-off limbs -- presumably hacked off by rebels -- and berated
the renegades for causing widespread suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Curious civilians in the streets and marketplaces were reaching
up for the whirling papers, witnesses said, when rebels in the town
opened fire on the aircraft, which responded by randomly bombarding
the town -- eight bombs in four successive runs, according to
refugees who fled the fighting. Two witnesses independently said
they saw the bodies of at least 17 civilians killed.
</P>
<P>
   Army director of operations Col. Alfred Claude Nelson Williams
said it was ''rather unfortunate if a few civilians were around and
were wounded'' in Makeni, but otherwise would not comment on
reports of civilian deaths. He said the attack helicopter had
targeted only rebel hideouts, including a former veterinary clinic
occupied by both rebel fighters and civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers said the bombings and propaganda campaign could
be the start of an effort by the government to clear Makeni and
other rebel towns of civilians to clear the ground for advancing
government troops. An uneasy alliance of pro-government forces --
including former enemy junta fighters and traditional hunter
militiamen -- have slowly pushed closer to Makeni and toppled
several rebel-held towns in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The government forces are being aided by military advisers and
technical equipment from Britain, Sierra Leone's former colonial
ruler. A growing number of U.N. troops have also arrived in the
country in a bid to salvage the country's lapsed peace accord,
signed last year.
</P>
<P>
   If driving civilians out of rebel-held front-line territory was
the government's goal, it appeared to be working.
</P>
<P>
   At least 21,000 civilians fled Makeni and nearby Magburaka in
recent days to the crossroads town of Mile 91, 30 miles to the
south, United Nations spokesman David Wimhurst said. Some went on
to Freetown and many more were believed on their way.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-year-old Victor Kanu left with his wife, four children
and three sisters from a village on the outskirts of Makeni on June
1. They were forced to abandon their elderly grandmother, who could
not walk, he said, closing his eyes and holding his head as he
related the ordeal at the ''Mandela camp'' for the internally
displaced in Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   ''We survived, I don't know how,'' Kanu said. ''My grandmother
... (her fate) is in the hands of God now.''
</P>
<P>
   Isata Conteh and her husband and three small children fled
Makeni after the first round of bombings only to narrowly escape
two other battles between pro-government Kamajor militiamen and
rebel fighters during a grueling nine-day journey by foot to the
capital.
</P>
<P>
   ''The rebels tried to stop us from going. They said 'you should
die with us,''' Conteh said at another burgeoning tent city for
refugees in the capital. The family slipped into the surrounding
scrub forest and slogged for days through swamps and rivers to the
east.
</P>
<P>
   On one occasion, pro-government soldiers at the town of Port
Loko had assaulted and robbed her family and other refugees who
were traveling with them, she said. The troops accused them of
being ''rebel spies,'' Conteh said, her voice heaving with laughter
but her eyes moist with tears as she recalled the ordeal. The
fighters eventually let them pass after robbing them of their
remaining belongings.
</P>
<P>
   Conteh said she would not return to her home until long after
Sierra Leone's war was finally over. She did not trust either the
government or rebel forces to protect her family.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government is bombing us, the rebels (are capable of
doing) anything to us at any time they like,'' she said. ''We are
just tired of this war.''

<HEADLINE> Asbury Park, Neptune teens clash in post-party fight  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ASBURY PARK, N.J. (AP) - About ten people were charged with
disorderly conduct in a street fight involving 250 teens that began
as people cursing at each other and escalated into bottle- and
rock-throwing.
</P>
<P>
   Several police officers suffered minor injuries in the Friday
night clash between city teens and teens from Neptune, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the people in the fight had just left a Sweet 16 party
at Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 2639 on Corlies Avenue in Neptune,
police said. The teens met on a street in Asbury Park and began
fighting shortly before 11:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fight was Asbury against Neptune,'' Asbury Park police
Sgt. Chris Van Buren told the Asbury Park Press of Neptune for
Sunday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   ''You could hear people in the crowd saying, 'Hey those ----
from Asbury,' and then you heard them answering, 'Those ---- kids
from Neptune,''' Van Buren said.
</P>
<P>
   It took about 25 police officers to break up the fight. Police
said they had a hard time breaking up the fight, adding other
fights were reported in other parts of the city until 2 a.m.
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Those under arrest were released after being charged. Police
didn't identify the people who were arrested but said some were
juveniles and all were males from either Asbury Park or Neptune.

<HEADLINE> Burton: Justice Should Probe Clinton  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM C. MANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The chief Republican congressional
investigator of political fund raising in 1996 said he is likely to
refer President Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and Attorney
General Janet Reno for prosecution after a new president takes
office next year.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dan Burton said Sunday it appears Reno obstructed justice
by refusing several times to request special prosecutors to
investigate Clinton and Gore for money-raising irregularities
during their campaign four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Gore knew they were breaking the law, Burton said,
but ''I can't give you the specifics of it right now.''
</P>
<P>
   ''But I can tell you, I am confident and certain that they knew,
especially the president, that illegal campaign contributions were
coming in from foreign sources,'' the Indiana Republican said on
NBC's ''Meet the Press.'' ''And all that needs to be looked at
thoroughly by the Justice Department.''
</P>
<P>
   But not Reno's Justice Department, he said: ''I think Janet Reno
has blocked for the president, as have her top officials over at
the Justice Department. I think they've made a mockery of
justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's chief of staff, John Podesta, said Burton's comments
were not surprising.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's been at this for a long time,'' Podesta said on CNN's
''Late Edition.'' ''These partisan investigations that go on and on
and on.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's reminding me a little bit of reruns of 'Star Trek.' You
know, ... there's a certain group of devotees that like to put the
long ears on and go to the convention. But I think it's becoming a
smaller and smaller group of Americans who actually pay attention
to people like chairman Burton.''
</P>
<P>
   Podesta contended that Burton's main intent is to inflict
political damage on Gore in his run for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Burton hopes for a Republican administration, with Texas Gov.
George W. Bush as president.
</P>
<P>
   ''After this election, assuming we get a new attorney general, I
think I will be sending criminal referrals,'' Burton said. ''And
the reason I'm waiting is that I don't think this Justice
Department is going to do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   ''You will in all likelihood send in criminal referrals urging
the indictment of Bill Clinton and Al Gore?'' ''Meet the Press''
host Tim Russert asked later.
</P>
<P>
   ''And I'll go a little bit further than that,'' Burton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe that Janet Reno ... and her chief lieutenants knew
that the independent counsel statute mandated that they appoint an
independent counsel, and they didn't do it. ... If she did not
appoint an independent counsel because she thought her job was in
jeopardy, even though the law required it, she broke the law and
obstructed justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Appearing after Burton was Lee Radek, a career prosecutor who
heads the Justice Department's public integrity section and is a
top adviser to Reno on independent counsel matters.
</P>
<P>
   He said Justice investigators who looked into the campaign
fund-raising charges did not find evidence of wrongdoing that met
the legal requirements for appointment of special investigators.
FBI Director Louis Freeh and the chief of Justice's campaign
fund-raising task force disagreed and recommended independent
counsels.
</P>
<P>
   Radek also denied claims by two FBI agents before Burton's
Government Reform Committee that Radek told them he was under
pressure not to recommend investigators because Reno's job was on
the line.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact is the public integrity section was under a lot of
pressure at the time,'' Radek said. ''We were under pressure from
the Congress, from the press and particularly from the attorney
general, who's a tough taskmaster, to do a good job.''

<HEADLINE> Kelsey Grammer Plans Theater Return  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RADNOR, Pa. (AP) -- Kelsey Grammer, who will play the title role
in ''Macbeth'' this summer on Broadway, says he is returning to the
stage partly because of a heightened sense of mortality.
</P>
<P>
   The 45-year-old star of the sitcom ''Frasier'' says the untimely
deaths of his father and sister made him more aware of how short
life is.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will always be foolhardy because, to me, the best fruit of
life is the idea that you don't always play it safe. If you don't
reach beyond where you're comfortable, you will not grow,'' he says
in the June 17 issue of TV Guide.
</P>
<P>
   He also says he's expecting some tough reviews from New York
drama critics.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't had this much fun since I rolled my car,'' he says,
referring to the 1996 wreck that nearly killed him and sent him
into drug rehab.

<HEADLINE> Samuel L. Jackson Kept Shaft Tough  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Samuel L. Jackson said he was the cat who
wouldn't cop out when there was conflict on the set of ''Shaft.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson and director John Singleton said the studio wanted to
soften the lead character.
</P>
<P>
   John Shaft, a hip New York detective known for his hot temper,
cool style and womanizing ways was played by Richard Roundtree in
the original movie. Roundtree reprises that role in the new version
and Jackson plays his nephew in the lead role, also a hip New York
detective named John Shaft.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson wanted no part of a kinder, gentler Shaft.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to be faithful to what I think the 'Shaft' movie is,
so I'm not going to get bullied or allow whoever else is being
bullied into doing something that I don't want to do just to defuse
(an argument,)'' Jackson said in Sunday's Daily News of Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Singleton agreed to cut much of the sex from the
movie, but kept the violent action sequences.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're living in an even more puritanical society than we were
30 years ago. So it's OK for Shaft to bash somebody's head in, but
to show him (having sex), well, that would offend women, I guess,''
he said.

<HEADLINE> British, Saudi Princes To Debut Art  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Prince Charles and Saudi Prince Khalid Al-Faisal
will bring a touch of royalty to the art world this week.
</P>
<P>
   The princes, both amateur artists, will open a joint exhibition
of their paintings in London, aides said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Titled ''Painting and Patronage,'' it features 30 recent
watercolors by Charles and 26 oil paintings by the Saudi prince.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition will run June 16-21 at the Banqueting House in
Whitehall, near the Houses of Parliament, and will be shown in
Saudi Arabia next year.
</P>
<P>
   Charles and Prince Khalid, son of the late King Faisal bin Abdul
Aziz, have known each other for many years and share interests in
the arts and in painting.
</P>
<P>
   Charles, who periodically makes solitary painting trips to rural
Britain or abroad, has completed more than 450 works since the
early 80s.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition will include Charles' new landscapes of Scotland,
Provence, Greece and Turkey, as well as two views of mountain
scenery in Asir.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have tried in my (Asir) paintings of the area to capture
something of the grandeur of the scenery, the peaceful atmosphere
and the effect of sunlight on the serried ranks of mountains,''
Charles said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Inspects Lebanon-Israel Border  </HEADLINE>
By RODEINA KENAAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   KFAR KILA, Lebanon (AP) -- Lebanon protested to the United
Nations on Sunday that the newly drawn frontier with Israel had
been misplaced.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanese President Emile Lahoud sent a memorandum to U.N.
Secretary General Kofi Annan saying U.N. cartographers had rejected
''an existing and recognized border to establish in its place a
fictitious withdrawal line to be used as the basis for confirmation
of the Israeli pullout.''
</P>
<P>
   A copy of the memorandum was given to The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. special envoy Terje Roed-Larsen, who has been discussing
the frontier with the Lebanese and Israeli governments, said the
cartographers were not trying to redraw the border, but to define
it according to the line fixed in 1923 by colonial France and
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, people on the Lebanese side of the fence threw stones
Sunday at an Israeli border post, but Israeli troops held their
fire. The soldiers, under orders to shoot only in self-defense,
have wounded at least three people in stoning incidents since
Israel troops withdrew from south Lebanon on May 24.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of people have arrived daily in the border village of
Kfar Kila to vent their anger at Israel and take a look at the
country they have never seen up close
</P>
<P>
   U.N. sources said on condition of anonymity that the border
surveying operation began its third full day of work Sunday,
picking up from where it left off Saturday about 15 miles east of
the Mediterranean coast. The operation stopped Sunday night at the
border village of Maroun al-Ras, and was to resume Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Slow progress in verifying the 140-mile border has pushed back
the deployment of U.N. peacekeepers in southern Lebanon, where
anti-Israeli guerrillas have been the only real authority since the
Israeli withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Annan instructed the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon,
or UNIFIL, to complete the verification urgently. Little was
achieved that day because Lebanese officials objected to the line
drawn by U.N. cartographers.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon said it would deploy its own military to the area only
after the 4,500-member UNIFIL verified that all Israeli troops were
gone.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's withdrawal ended an 18-year occupation of southern
Lebanon and almost daily battles with Lebanese guerrillas. The
occupation was aimed at protecting northern Israeli towns from
cross-border guerrilla raids.

<HEADLINE> NJ parole chief's relationships under scrutiny  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HACKENSACK, N.J. (AP) - Authorities are investigating if New
Jersey state parole board chairman Andrew Consovoy had any dealings
or relationships with underworld figures, according to a published
report.
</P>
<P>
   Consovoy was named to the chairman position in 1998 by Gov.
Christie Whitman. Consovoy has said he is friends with a man who in
the 1970s as a county correctional officer illegally helped an
inmate in Essex County Jail meet women on the outside and get pizza
and fast food.
</P>
<P>
   That man, Joseph ''Gus'' Ferrera, has told Consovoy he knows
people in the mob, The Record of Hackensack reported in Sunday's
editions.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities are questioning Consovoy's relationship with
Ferrera, according to the newspaper, which also reported
authorities are interested in Consovoy's relationship with Dennis
Steo. Steo spent 23 years in prison for two murders police
described as cold-blooded, gangland-style executions.
</P>
<P>
   Consovoy has said he knows Steo but says they aren't friends,
the newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper cited unidentified law enforcement sources and
several people interviewed by investigators, reporting that
authorities are especially interested in Ferrera's role as a state
employee assigned to help inmates prepare for parole.
</P>
<P>
   Court records indicate Ferrera spent seven months in state
prison after getting caught helping the Essex County Jail inmate.
He had been sentenced to three years, but was paroled after seven
months, according to prison records. Before his parole was over,
Ferrera was hired by the state Department of Corrections as an
''ombudsman,'' according to state employment records. The
Department of Corrections is a separate agency from the Parole
Board.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrera now earns $73,000 a year working in the Passaic County
Jail, said Chris Carden, a corrections department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Consovoy last month told The Record he is close friends with
Ferrera, and recently attended his daughter's wedding, the
newspaper reported. He also told the newspaper he used Ferrera's
condo in Marco Island, Fla., this spring for vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Does he know people who are in (the mob)? Sure he does. But a
guy's your friend, a guy's your friend,'' the paper quoted him as
saying. ''If he's involved in organized crime, it's a surprise to
me. If he knows people in it, it wouldn't be a surprise to me. I
make no bones about my friendship with Joe.''
</P>
<P>
   But the newspaper also reported Consovoy said in an interview
last week he sees Ferrera only once every few months for lunch or
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   The other relationship the newspaper said authorities are
interested in is between Consovoy and Steo, the man convicted of
the two murders.
</P>
<P>
   Steo was released in 1995 after serving 23 years of a life
sentence, according to Parole Board records. Steo was convicted for
gunning down his partner in a stolen car chop-shop operation. Nine
months later, he shot an elderly Philadelphia gambler and dumped
the body in a creek, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Consovoy told The Record he didn't remember meeting Steo at a
Trenton restaurant party thrown in honor of Consovoy's appointment
to chairman. But the newspaper cited unidentified guests in saying
Consovoy and Steo were at the party. And one guest told the
newspaper Consovoy recognized Steo, shook his hand and sat down
with him. The guest also told the newspaper he flinched with
discomfort to see the newly appointed chairman rubbing elbows with
Steo.
</P>
<P>
   ''Did I run into him? I don't recall it. He's no friend of
mine,'' Consovoy told The Record.
</P>
<P>
   It's not known if investigators are looking into the Trenton
party.
</P>
<P>
   No charges have been filed in the investigation.

<HEADLINE> NY Cops Urge Springsteen Boycott  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- There will be plenty of police on hand Monday
for the opening night of Bruce Springsteen's 10-concert stand at
Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   But the officers not on duty are being urged by their union, the
Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, to boycott the concert and not
attend on their own.
</P>
<P>
   A Springsteen song inspired by last year's police slaying of an
unarmed West African immigrant in the Bronx has prompted a call for
a boycott of his concerts by the police union.
</P>
<P>
   Amadou Diallo, 22, was hit by 19 bullets and killed in the
vestibule of his apartment building. The four officers involved in
the shooting were acquitted of murder in February.
</P>
<P>
   Springsteen's unrecorded and unreleased song, first performed in
Atlanta a week ago, opens with the words ''41 shots, 41 shots'' --
the number of bullets fired at Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   It includes the line, ''You can get killed just for living in
your American skin.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I happen to like Springsteen,'' Officer Orlando Vega told the
Daily News. ''But we're trying to work in this community, and him
opening up old wounds just makes our jobs more difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   A Springsteen spokesman had no comment last week on the new song
or its inspiration.

<HEADLINE> NATO Marks 1 Year in Kosovo  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE JAHN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- For Kosovo's Albanians, they came as
saviors. Most Serbs saw them as the enemy. But both sides agree
that since NATO-led peacekeepers arrived one year ago, their
province has not been the same.
</P>
<P>
   For the Albanians, the entry of NATO-led peacekeepers on June
12, 1999, signaled a new beginning -- self-determination after
decades of Serb oppression; peace after more than a year of war
against a powerful enemy, and a chance for democracy and
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   For Serbs, NATO's arrival meant the end of Serbian control of
the cradle of their culture. It also meant the end of the good life
as a privileged minority with all the state jobs, and most other
perks.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, the big guns are silent. Serb-led Yugoslav forces
are gone and the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army has been
disbanded, officially at least.
</P>
<P>
   But small arms continue dealing out death in near daily killings
motivated by ethnic hatreds. Most Albanians are no longer targeted
because of their ethnicity. But Serbs now are, in a slew of revenge
killings and other crimes meant to make them pay for the earlier
crimes Serbs committed against them.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, a crowd killed three ethnic Albanians near the
divided northern city of Kosovska Mitrovica, but NATO spokesman
Maj. Jose Pardo de Santayana said he could not confirm reports that
the mob who attacked them spoke Serb.
</P>
<P>
   Across the province, whole villages are being rebuilt -- but only
those inhabited by ethnic Albanians. Although Serb communities
suffered little damage during the war, Serbs who did not flee
earlier are doing so now because of continued threats.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder that Serb and Albanian look back at NATO's arrival
differently.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are many wrong things that happened during this year,''
says Besa Kabashi, a 23-year-old Albanian. ''But the most important
thing is that the Serb forces are out of Kosovo once and forever,
and we have the NATO troops to protect us here.''
</P>
<P>
   To the north, on the Serb side of Kosovska Mitrovica, Rade Zivic
curses the day the first NATO peacekeeper trod on Kosovo's soil.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hated them before and I hate them now,'' says the
44-year-old laborer. ''I will live in fear as long as NATO is
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Few residents actually saw the first troops arrive on June 12,
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Most Albanians unable to flee the province stayed in hiding,
after months of Serb rule. NATO bombing -- meant to get President
Slobodan Milosevic's forces out of Kosovo -- appeared instead to
encourage Serbs to crack down even harder on ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the battle for Kosovo lost, many Serbs fled ahead of
the peacekeepers. Others barricaded themselves in their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mostly the streets were empty,'' recalls Maj. John Spiszer, of
the 2nd Battalion, 2nd Infantry Regiment, who was part of the first
wave to arrive from Macedonia. ''There was hardly anybody out
there. It was pretty desolate.''
</P>
<P>
   Spiszer, 38, of Diamond Bar, Calif., remembers the chaos that
met the growing number of NATO-led troops as they spread out across
the province -- the Americans to the East, the British in the
center, the Germans to the South, the French to the North and the
Italians in the West.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was shooting; there was arson, there was just something
every night,'' he says. ''One of my most vivid memories -- just so
much burning every night.''
</P>
<P>
   The Maxharrajs have different memories -- reaching back to the
nightmare months during the NATO bombing that started March 24.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were standing there in front of the window, just waiting,
then we heard the first detonations,'' recalls Remzije Maxharraj,
serving steaming Turkish coffee. ''We had a surge of happiness -- we
thought it would last only three or four days.''
</P>
<P>
   Days stretched into weeks, then months. Remzije, 50, stayed
inside, along with her two children Edmond and Albana, fearful of
marauding Serbs. Her husband, Syla, ventured outside every few days
to gather necessities.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to flee to Macedonia were foiled. Three times they
reached the border -- only to be turned back by Macedonian guards.
Once, Serb border police separated their 20-year-old son and their
daughter, 22, and demanded $100 for their return.
</P>
<P>
   ''We paid,'' says Remzije. ''Happily.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more harrowing was a police raid on the apartment in late
May.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were wild. They were shouting over each other so you
couldn't make sense of what they were saying,'' recalls Syla, 56.
''They screamed at us, 'where are your weapons, where did you hide
your money?'''
</P>
<P>
   Then they separated Edmond.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said, where are you taking my Edi?'' Remzije says, her eyes
moist with memories. ''They said, 'We are taking him as a human
shield against NATO.' I said, 'take me and my husband; take the
car, take the apartment, but leave the kids alone.'''
</P>
<P>
   Edmond, 20, came home unharmed about five hours later. He had
been released following questioning, after a police officer who
lived in a neighboring apartment intervened. That same officer
showed up weeks later, as NATO troops moved toward Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was crying,'' recalls Edmond, eyes thoughtful behind
wire-rimmed glasses. ''He said, 'I have to go, there is no place
for us Serbs here anymore.' I thanked him one hundred times for
what he did for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Edmond's sister, Albana, saw the U.S. Apache helicopters
sweeping low over Pristina's airport. They were followed by
potbellied transport choppers.
</P>
<P>
   ''She screamed, 'come and see this, you won't believe it,'''
says Edmond. ''How can I describe the feeling -- unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   His father, Syla, says it was ''like having a mountain on your
head for months that was suddenly removed.''
</P>
<P>
   Syla suffered a heart attack the next day. His wife accompanied
him to the hospital and saw a Pristina transformed, teeming with
uniformed men who were friends, not enemies.
</P>
<P>
   ''My heart leapt when I saw all those soldiers, in position and
ready to fight,'' she says. ''I realized the nightmare was over,
and my children were safe.''
</P>
<P>
   For Kosovo Albanians like the Maxharrajs, the euphoria that
accompanied NATO's arrival is history. The United Nations now runs
a province kept alive on foreign aid -- and foreign guns. Most
Kosovo Albanians continue to insist on independence, but the United
Nations considers their province part of Serbia, and there are no
international plans to change that.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Syla, a county judge, has hope.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every beginning is hard and the main thing is that Albanians
are free,'' he says. We want a democracy like in the United States.
Maybe I won't live to see the day, but my kids will.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is no future for Serbs like Dragan Kosanovic, who fled
ethnic warfare in Croatia in 1995 -- and is now thinking of running
again.
</P>
<P>
   ''As long as NATO is here there will be no chance for Serbs to
return to their homes,'' he says bitterly from Kosovska Mitrovica.
''There's no salvation for Serbs in Kosovo as long as the United
States leads the world.''

<HEADLINE> Reports: Yankees Sign Dwight Gooden  </HEADLINE>
By JOSH DUBOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Yankees are giving Dwight Gooden
yet another chance.
</P>
<P>
   The 35-year-old right-hander, 10 victories shy of 200 in the
major leagues, has signed a minor league contract with the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ''We still feel like he has something left in his arm,'' Yankees
pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre said Sunday. Stottlemyre coached
Gooden with the Mets and the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden, released by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays two weeks ago, told
The Sunday Record of Hackensack that he was ''totally blown away''
at the opportunity to pitch for the Yankees again.
</P>
<P>
   ''George Steinbrenner is giving me a chance, and I'm going to
make the most of it,'' he told the paper.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner gave Gooden a chance before. The right-hander
joined the Yankees in 1996 after missing the 1995 season because of
a drug suspension.
</P>
<P>
   ''They love him here,'' Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter said.
''there are certain guys that New Yorkers always love. Doc is one
of those guys. It seems like wherever he is he is always popular
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Gooden threw the ninth no-hitter in club history May 14, 1996,
against the Mariners. He went 20-12 with a 4.58 ERA in two seasons
with the Yankees, but left following injuries and personal
differences with manager Joe Torre.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden was 2-3 with a 6.86 ERA for Houston and Tampa Bay this
season. He is 190-110 with a 3.51 ERA for his career.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees, who might have to put Ramiro Mendoza on the
disabled list, have little risk in signing Gooden because the Devil
Rays will pay the bulk of his $500,000 salary.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden will spend at least a week working at the club's minor
league complex in Tampa, Fla., and will go to Triple-A Columbus
when his arm strength is back.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to get him into shape and maybe he can provide us a
little insurance,'' Stottlemyre said. ''You never know when you are
going to need some more pitching.''

<HEADLINE> Cubs 6, White Sox 5  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Put away the brooms, White Sox fans. No sweep for
you.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa tied it with a two-run double in the seventh, and
pinch-hitter Chad Meyers drove in the winning run with a
ninth-inning grounder Sunday as the Chicago Cubs beat the Chicago
White Sox 6-5, avoiding a three-game sweep in the crosstown series.
</P>
<P>
   The loss snapped a six-game winning streak for the White Sox and
spoiled a two-homer day by Jose Valentin. The White Sox also got
home runs from Ray Durham, Frank Thomas and Magglio Ordonez.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs, who had led for just two half-innings the entire
series, found their offense late. With Eric Young on first in the
ninth, Brant Brown singled to shallow center off reliever Jesus
Pena, dropping the ball perfectly into the gap in right-center.
</P>
<P>
   Ordonez scooped the ball up and threw to third, but Young slid
and beat him by inches. That brought up Sosa, who tied the game in
the seventh but also was 2-for-13 with nine strikeouts for the
series.
</P>
<P>
   Pena walked Sosa, loading the bases with one out. Meyers
pinch-hit for Willie Greene, hitting a bouncer to short. Valentin
threw to second to get Sosa, but Durham couldn't throw to first in
time to get Meyers and Young scored the go-ahead run.
</P>
<P>
   Pena (1-1) gave up one run on two hits in 1 1-3 innings. He also
walked one and struck out one.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Van Poppel (1-2) stuck out three in 2 1-3 innings. Rick
Aguilera got the last out for his 12th save in 16 chances.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox took a 5-2 lead in the sixth inning with
back-to-back homers for the second time in the game. With two out,
Durham and Valentin both put long shots into the right-field
stands. Valentin also homered in the first, a solo shot that was
his 100th career home run.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas and Ordonez connected back-to-back in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Though Cubs starter Ismael Valdes gave up a career-high five
homers, his teammates took him off the hook with their
seventh-inning rally.
</P>
<P>
   James Baldwin started the seventh by hitting Damon Buford, and
then walked Jeff Reed with no outs. Kelly Wunsch relieved Baldwin
and gave up a run when Young singled.
</P>
<P>
   Wunsch struck out Brown for the second out, and Bill Simas was
then brought in to face Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, who was booed all weekend, finally got a good at-bat,
doubling all the way back to the right-center wall to score Reed
and Young and tie the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs got their first two runs on a two-run homer by Brown,
who just joined the club Saturday after being acquired as part of a
three-team trade.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Valentin's 11 home runs are the most for a White Sox
shortstop since Ron Hansen hit 11 in 1965. ... The White Sox have
now homered in 15 straight games, one shy of the club record set in
1987. ... The White Sox drew 131,104 fans for the three-game
series. It's the second-largest crowd ever at new Comiskey; the
largest was for last year's city series.

<HEADLINE> Cheers for Clinton, shrugs for Lazio at Puerto Rican parade  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton danced to salsa music and
was wildly cheered at the Puerto Rican Day Parade Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   It was a stark contrast to the hostile reception she received at
two of the city's other recent ethnic parades, the St. Patrick's
Day and Salute to Israel events.
</P>
<P>
   ''This parade just loves her,'' said state Assemblyman Roberto
Ramirez, D-Bronx, one of a phalanx of Hispanic elected officials to
march with the first lady, as Fifth Avenue echoed with deafening
cheers for her.
</P>
<P>
   Her opponent in the Senate race, Rep. Rick Lazio, eagerly shook
hands with revelers but got a mixed reception and a lot of ''Who's
that?'' from the pro-Clinton crowd. The first lady was even cheered
by a small group of spectators holding Lazio signs distributed by
his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Boos dominated as Lazio passed by, but the jeers appeared aimed
mostly at Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who walked with him. Lazio
replaced the mayor as the Republican candidate three weeks ago when
Giuliani dropped out of the race because he has prostate cancer.
Friction between minorities and the police and other local issues
have decreased the mayor's support among Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Also walking in the Republican group were former Bronx
congressman Herman Badillo, a political icon among New York Puerto
Ricans, and George P. Bush, son of Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and nephew
of Republican presidential hopeful George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   George P. Bush, whose mother is Mexican, was an honorary grand
marshal of the parade.
</P>
<P>
   At one point Lazio suddenly dropped to one knee, and camera
crews and photographers converged. But Lazio, who fell and split
his lip in a Memorial Day Parade, was only tying his shoe.
</P>
<P>
   The cameras whirred for Clinton when she broke into an impromptu
dance with Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer, shimmying her
shoulders and spinning around on Fifth Avenue to the beat of a
blaring salsa band.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wanted to do it all the way down the avenue but we couldn't
get the band to come,'' Clinton said, flushed from the 90-degree
heat and smiling broadly. ''Maybe next time - maybe we'll dance on
a float.''
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Clinton angered many Puerto Ricans by opposing
clemency for a group of political prisoners who had been involved
in terrorist activities related to Puerto Rican nationalism. She
announced her opposition without consulting Hispanic officials, and
it was widely portrayed as a misstep in the ethnic minefield of
local politics.
</P>
<P>
   But those who marched with her Sunday said her support for
ending the U.S. Navy bombing on the Puerto Rican island of Vieques
had made up for the clemency fiasco.
</P>
<P>
   ''People felt so passionately and strongly about the treatment
Vieques has been given for 60 years from the U.S. Navy that her
position on that almost healed the wound,'' said Bronx City
Councilman Adolfo Carrion.
</P>
<P>
   ''She has consulted, spoken to and worked with every one of the
Puerto Rican elected officials,'' said Ramirez. ''I believe she
will take to the U.S. Senate a clear and very strong message that
the Navy must leave Vieques.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said she supports ''a complete cessation of the bombing
and an immediate referendum that would permit the people of Vieques
to make that decision on their own.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has voted twice to end the bombings. ''As long as we get
the agreement of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that there are no
security concerns, we should phase out all our bombing operations
on Vieques,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Navy uses Vieques for bombing target practice, and
President Clinton has agreed to order the Navy out by May 2003 if
the island's 9,400 residents vote in a referendum to expel it.
Until then, the Navy training continues with concrete-filled dummy
bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Although the parade was dedicated to the memory of the late
Puerto Rican bandleader Tito Puente, Vieques was the theme most
revelers expressed on T-shirts and posters that read ''Paz para
Vieques,'' peace for Vieques.

<HEADLINE> Wet spring, drab skies, a recipe for cold mountain lakes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LAKE GEORGE, N.Y. (AP) - Rampant spring rains this year mean
more lake water for the sun to heat; constant cloudiness means rays
aren't getting much of a shot at the job.
</P>
<P>
   With water temperatures at the popular Million Dollar Beach here
hovering around 55 degrees, even the heartiest of early season
swimmers can expect to shiver. And researchers say the case will be
the same at deep-water lakes throughout the Adirondacks.
</P>
<P>
   How cold is 55 degrees? Some benchmarks: off the coast of Maine,
the Atlantic Ocean usually hits 63 in summer. Farther down the
coast, off the southern coast of Cape Cod, water temperatures peak
at about 72, compared to the 86 degrees that washes ashore the
beaches of Miami Beach in Florida.
The lap-swim water at one local YMCA measured at 83 degrees.
In general, lakes get their warmth from the penetrating rays of the
sun as well as warming air temperatures. Shallow waters are doubly
warmed when the sun's rays penetrate through to the lake bottom,
which also warms.
</P>
<P>
   ''Keep in mind that with the last storm, some of the
precipitation in the Adirondacks came down as snow,'' Larry
Eichler, a research scientist with Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute's Darrin Freshwater Institute told the Sunday Gazette of
Schenectady.
''With all the rainfall and cloud cover we've had, I can tell you
that the water temperature is probably significantly colder than it
would normally be,'' said Howie Altschule, a meteorologist with
local TV station WNYT. ''We haven't had a lot of sun, and all the
rain we've had just gives us that much more water that has to be
heated.''
</P>
<P>
   In Lake George's case, it's not so much that the water is cold,
but that it is colder.
</P>
<P>
   ''On its warmest day in the middle of July, it's cold,'' Thomas
Wardell, director of engineering for the Lake George Park
Commission, said with a laugh. ''It's always cold.''

<HEADLINE> France Floods Cause Evacuations  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LYON, France (AP) -- Hundreds of people were evacuated from
southern France and the Pyrenees Mountains over the weekend, after
violent rains and snowstorms caused flooding and a bus accident
that left at least one person dead on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Rains had mostly stopped Sunday, but hundreds of homes were left
without electricity. France's national power company, EDF, was
working to restore power to 700 homes in the southeastern
Rhone-Alps region.
</P>
<P>
   A bus traveling on an elevated highway near the southwestern
city of Toulouse jumped the guardrail and plunged to the road
below, police said. One person was killed, and several were
injured.
</P>
<P>
   Some 200 students were evacuated from a university on Ramier
Island, near Toulouse, on Saturday, and 100 people were evacuated
from campsites near the Loire Valley's Coise River.
</P>
<P>
   Several homes and campsites in the Ariege region, near the
Pyrenees, were also evacuated.

<HEADLINE> Nazi Hunter: Assad Death a 'Relief'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- The death of Syrian President Hafez Assad could
help determine what happened to a Nazi war crimes suspect believed
to have lived in Syria, French Nazi hunter Serge Klarsfeld said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''From a moral standpoint ... I would say it is a relief to see
Assad's departure to another world and a possibility to know the
truth'' about Nazi war criminal suspect Alois Brunner, Klarsfeld
said on France Info radio.
</P>
<P>
   Assad, Syria's leader for 30 years, died Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   A French court ruled in December that it would try Brunner in
absentia for allegedly deporting 250 Jewish children to Auschwitz,
where they died.
</P>
<P>
   Brunner, one of the world's most-wanted Nazi war criminals, is
believed to have lived for years in Syria. France requested his
extradition, but Assad said that, to his knowledge, Brunner was not
in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Brunner's whereabouts have been a nagging issue in French-Syria
relations.
</P>
<P>
   Klarsfeld said that Assad's death ahead of Brunner's upcoming
trial could help determine if Brunner ''was still alive or in what
conditions he lived.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We will know the truth one day,'' said Klarsfeld, head of the
Association of Sons and Daughters of Deported Jews of France. ''The
Assad regime has been prejudicial from all moral standpoints.''
</P>
<P>
   Brunner served as a top aide to Adolf Eichmann, the overseer of
the Nazi death machine. He allegedly helped organize the
deportation and murder of at least 130,000 Jews from Germany,
Austria, France and Greece.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, the German news weekly Bunte published an interview
with photographs of Brunner -- then alias Georg Fischer -- outside
his Syrian villa. Investigations since then have been unable to
determine if Brunner was still alive. If so, he would be in his
late 80s.

<HEADLINE> Salsa and politics - Puerto Ricans shake it up at annual parade  </HEADLINE>
By PAISLEY DODDS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Hundreds of thousands turned out Sunday for the
Puerto Rican Day Parade, swaying to the thumping sounds of salsa
and criticizing the U.S. Navy's use of Vieques Island as a bombing
range.
</P>
<P>
   The parade up Fifth Avenue had its usual crowd-pleasers:
sequin-clad marching bands, floats, salsa bands, celebrities and
gyrating dancers.
</P>
<P>
   But this year's celebration also took on a political tone with
organizers dedicating the event to Vieques and Pedro Albizu Campos,
a figure in Puerto Rico's separatist movement who urged islanders
to start an armed struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ''Libertad!'' shouted throngs of parade-goers on a steaming hot
afternoon. ''Vieques, si, Marinos no!'' they chanted.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of Puerto Rico's pro-statehood New Progressive Party,
including Gov. Pedro Rossello, boycotted the parade because of the
Albizu dedication, but there was resounding unity over Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   Signs that read ''Paz para Vieques'' or ''Peace for Vieques''
draped the police barricades. A mock U.S. navy vessel dragging an
effigy of Uncle Sam trailed a 45-foot banner that read ''No More
Bombs.''
</P>
<P>
   In April 1999, stray bombs killed civilian security guard David
Sanes on the range in Vieques Island, which the U.S. Navy has used
for combat training since the 1940s. The Navy resumed bombing last
month.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all want the same thing for the people of Vieques'' said
Jose Guzman, 45, who left Puerto Rico 35 years ago. ''We want the
Marines off Vieques and we don't want more people to die.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of people leaped over the police barricades when they saw
Ruben Berrios, leader of the Puerto Rican Independence Party. Some
embraced him while others shook his hand.
</P>
<P>
   On May 4, federal agents detained Berrios and 215 others,
clearing them from the bombing range and other Navy land on
Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   ''I came to the parade to pay tribute to my heritage but this
year is also different,'' said Christian Fernandez, 27, as she
frantically waived her Puerto Rican flag and wiggled her hips. ''I
came to speak out against what is happening in Vieques.''
</P>
<P>
   While the parade was also dedicated to Albizu, Puerto Ricans
remain divided over whether the U.S. territory should become a
state, achieve independence or continue its current status that
allows its residents citizenship but prevents them from voting for
president.
</P>
<P>
   Albizu, a Harvard-educated lawyer and leader of the Puerto Rican
Nationalist Party, was jailed on charges of trying to overthrow the
U.S. government. In 1950 he was convicted of inciting his followers
to try to kill President Harry Truman during a failed attack in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He was pardoned in 1953, but was imprisoned again in 1954 after
four followers opened fire inside the U.S. House of
Representatives, wounding five lawmakers. He was released from
prison in 1964 and died in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   ''Albizu, who's that?'' asked Jessica Torres, 19. ''We came to
see Marc Anthony!'' The musician, however, was a no-show.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds screamed when actors Jimmy Smits and Rosie Perez waived
to them. Even bigger howls were heard when they saw boxer Felix
Trinidad waving to them from his convertible.
</P>
<P>
   Missing this year was Puerto Rico's mambo king, Tito Puente, who
died May 31.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really sad that he isn't here this year to celebrate,''
said Jaritza Rodriguez, 16. ''I grew up with his music. My whole
family did.''
</P>
<P>
   The parade has been a New York tradition since 1957.

<HEADLINE> More than 500 swimmers compete in annual Chesapeake Bay swim  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KENT ISLAND, Md. (AP) - An aerospace engineer from New Jersey
and a former school teacher from Massachusetts drew the loudest
applause Sunday as hundreds of spectators gathered near the finish
line for the annual 4.4 mile swim across the Chesapeake Bay.
</P>
<P>
   So what did Sean Brennan and Jean Ludtke do that so pleased the
crowd? Brennan, 26, from Forked River, N.J., finished the race the
fastest. His time of one hour, 26 minutes and 42 seconds cut more
than nine minutes off his winning time from last year's swim.
</P>
<P>
   And Ludtke, the oldest of the 559 swimmers, was the last
competitor to emerge from the water, finishing in four hours, 15
minutes and 20 seconds. It was the second time the Hyannis Port,
Mass., woman competed in the annual March of Dimes benefit race
from Sandy Point State Park on the western side of the bay to
Hemingway's Beach on the eastern side.
</P>
<P>
   Ludtke, who turned 76 on Saturday, said Sunday's swim across the
Chesapeake will likely be her last.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan, who finished the last hundred yards of the race using a
combination of free style and butterfly strokes, crossed the finish
line with energy to spare.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel like a million bucks,'' he said. ''I couldn't ask for
better conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Susie Rabiah, 33, from Shaker Heights, Oh., finished first among
women with a time of one hour, 40 minutes and 43 seconds. It was
Rabiah's first bay swim.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first 45 minutes I just went with the flow,'' said Rabiah.
''Then I decided it was time to kick it.''
</P>
<P>
   The bay waters were relatively calm and, at 69 degrees, warm
when the first of two groups of swimmers entered the water shortly
before 10 a.m. Organizers set the swim schedule so swimmers would
encounter minimum tidal currents, race director Charles Nabit said.
</P>
<P>
   After noon the breeze picked up and the bay grew choppy,
producing less than perfect conditions for the slower swimmers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was so turbulent,'' Ludtke said. ''It was rough. Near the
end, I kept thinking how tired I was.''
</P>
<P>
   The bay swim began 19 years ago with a solo crossing by Brian
Earley, 39, a former Annapolis resident who now lives in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will be a world class swimming event some day,'' said
Earley, who flew in from the west coast to participate in Sunday's
event. ''There's only one Chesapeake Bay.''
</P>
<P>
   Nabit said the event, which raised about $50,000 for the Central
Maryland and Eastern Shore March of Dimes, reached its cap of 600
swimmers in 24 hours when registration began Feb. 1 on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ''We keep it at 600 for safety reasons,'' he said. ''If we
didn't place a cap on it, we'd have 3,500 or more people. It's that
popular.''
</P>
<P>
   Nabit said swimmers came to this year's event from 40 states and
five foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 559 who actually began the course, 539 finished the
crossing. The others were pulled from the bay for fatigue and other
physical problems by volunteer boaters who accompanied the swimmers
across the bay.

<HEADLINE> Violence Strikes Euro 2000 Again  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT MILLWARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROTTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- World Cup champion France made a
commanding start at the European Championships on Sunday, the
second straight day in which violence struck the showcase
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The French, bidding for a second European title, defeated
Denmark 3-0. Italy squandered many chances and needed a second-half
penalty kick to beat Turkey 2-1. And Netherlands downed the Czech
Republic 1-0 on a penalty kick with two minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   The Italy-Turkey game prompted a fight between rival fans
watching on a giant screen 125 miles away in Genk, Belgium. The
game itself was played without trouble in the Dutch city of Arnhem.
</P>
<P>
   The 16-nation tournament has been marked by violence on each of
its two days. Authorities detained 48 people in Brussels after
police used smoke bombs to disperse hundreds of rioting fans
following Belgium's opening victory Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Genk, a gritty mining town, has large immigrant community of
Turks and Italians.
</P>
<P>
   The violence broke out after fans tried to leave the stands and
take the field of Racing Genk Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Officials tried to hold them back, but rival fans began
fighting. Police intervened with nightsticks, and several people
were hurt although no serious injuries were immediately reported.
</P>
<P>
   In Brussels, police in riot gear fired smoke bombs hours after
the opening game in which Belgium beat Sweden 2-1. Officials denied
eyewitness accounts that tear gas was used on crowds near the
Grand' Place, the neo-classic central square.
</P>
<P>
   According to the police, around 100 masked hooligans managed to
mix with Belgian and Swedish fans.
</P>
<P>
   Brussels Mayor Francois-Xavier de Donnea said one vehicle was
vandalized. The prosecutor's office said two hooligans were being
held and one was charged. Police said about five people were
slightly injured.
</P>
<P>
   In Bruges, Belgium, the French showed why they are a strong
contender for the European crown, with Laurent Blanc, Thierry Henry
and substitute Sylvain Wiltord beating star goalie Peter Schmeichel
for goals.
</P>
<P>
   ''We needed to be very strong mentally to go through,'' French
coach Roger Lemerre said. ''Even if we are world champions we have
to begin again here.''
</P>
<P>
   In Arnhem, Netherlands, Filippo Inzaghi of Italy scored the
decisive penalty kick after being pushed down in the 70th minute.
Turkish fans responded to the referee's questionable call by
hurling debris on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey's Buruk Ocan and Italy's Antonio Conte exchanged goals
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ''From where I was sitting I think it was not a penalty,''
Turkish coach Mustafa Denizli said. ''After the penalty my team
lost concentration.''
</P>
<P>
   In Amsterdam, the Dutch pelted the goal with shots but needed a
penalty kick to end the outstanding run by the Czech Republic,
which went 10-0-0 during qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   The game was decided when Ronald de Boer had his shirt tugged in
the penalty area and twin brother Frank de Boer converted the kick.
</P>
<P>
   ''We escaped lucky here,'' Frank de Boer said. ''I've said it
often, you really need luck in a tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Germany plays Romania in Liege, Belgium, and Portugal
faces England in Eindhoven.
</P>
<P>
   Police are particularly wary of the several thousand English
fans heading to the team's opener. Police will have far-reaching
powers to deal with hooligans, and special holding facilities have
been set up in the Dutch cities of Amsterdam, Arnhem, Rotterdam and
Eindhoven.

<HEADLINE> One dead, one injured in botched restaurant robbery  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SUMTER, S.C. (AP) - One man is dead and another is in critical
condition after a restaurant robbery ended in gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   Guang Liang Lin, 28, was killed Saturday night by a single
gunshot wound to the chest, Police Chief Harold Johnson said. A
nursing supervisor said Tong Lin, 27, was in critical condition
Sunday at Palmetto Richland Memorial Hospital, where he was being
treated for multiple gunshot wounds.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether the victims were related.
</P>
<P>
   Police said two men with guns went into China Buffet and
demanded money. One of the robbers shot Guang Liang Lin after Tong
Lin began arguing with the robbers.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Sunday they had not identified any suspects, but
Johnson said restaurant customers were able to provide a vague
description of the gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said four other businesses in the area had been robbed
in the last two months.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we have a couple of people who are coming into town
and doing these robberies,'' Johnson said. ''We are going to do our
best to catch them and put them in prison.''
</P>
<P>
   Sumter County Coroner Verna Moore was trying to locate Guang
Liang Lin's family. She said Guang Liang Lin carried a New Jersey
driver's license, and that it appeared he had no relatives in South
Carolina.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Criticizes U.N. Monitoring  </HEADLINE>
By ANGUS SHAW
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Zimbabwe's president accused the United
Nations of trying to hijack international monitoring of his
country's parliamentary elections, which many doubted could be free
and fair amid rampant political violence, a newspaper reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations overstepped its welcome in trying to
coordinate election monitoring, President Robert Mugabe complained
to a state newspaper, a week after U.N. observers pulled out of the
country's election monitoring operations.
</P>
<P>
   Many questioned whether Zimbabwe was even capable of holding
fair elections. At least 31 people have been killed in political
violence since February. The main opposition Movement for
Democratic Change announced Sunday that another organizer had died
after being tortured by ruling party supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The June 24-25 election poses the biggest challenge to Mugabe
since he led the nation to independence from Britain in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe said he had invited the U.N. observers to work alongside
other foreign monitors, about 300 of whom have already arrived. But
the United Nations tried to assume ''an illegitimate role'' in
coordinating the observers, Mugabe said, according to The Sunday
Mail.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard explained in a statement from New
York: ''If we are not doing the coordination, there is no point in
us being there.'' Other foreign observers said the U.N. withdrawal
would not affect their operations, but could hurt the ballot's
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition parties and foreign groups, including Amnesty
International, have questioned whether Zimbabwe was able to hold
free and fair elections right now. They pointed to ruling party
militants occupying 1,400 white-owned farms, and to the
''state-sponsored terror'' campaign that has left at least 31
people dead, most of them opposition supporters.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the Movement for Democratic Change said opposition
organizer Finos Zhou, 21, had died after he and his older brother
were abducted June 4 and tortured by ruling party militants.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers were beaten and burnt with cigarettes before being
released, said Sekai Holland, the party's candidate for the remote
Mberengwa district. Finos died Friday at a party supporter's
farmhouse, while his brother was in critical care at a Zvishavane
district hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers -- who had been campaigning in Mberengwa -- were
targeted in the attack, Holland said. Police were not available for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Border Gezi, a top ruling party official, said Sunday that
opposition supporters were provoking the violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not like Jesus. If you hit our cheeks, we will hit
back,'' he told supporters at a rally for Stalin Mau-Mau, a ruling
party candidate in Harare's eastern suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Independent human rights monitors, however, said ruling party
militants, including the farm squatters, were responsible for
instigating up to 90 percent of the violence and intimidation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problems there do not really look as though they are
conducive to free and fair elections,'' Commonwealth Secretary
General Don McKinnon agreed Sunday during a radio interview with
the British Broadcasting Corp. in London ''Far too many people have
been killed. It is not a good omen.''

<HEADLINE> Iran Students Protest Win Annulment  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Dozens of Iranian students from the central
city of Arak demonstrated in front of Parliament here Sunday to
protest the annulment of a reformist candidate's win in run-off
legislative elections, the official Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-line Guardian Council, which oversees elections, on
Thursday overturned the election of reformist Rahman Kargosha and
awarded his seat to his hard-line rival Hassan Moradi on the
grounds of ''vote-rigging'' in Kargosha's favor, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   The election for Iran's parliament, or Majlis, was held Feb. 18.
Run-off elections took place in April.
</P>
<P>
   Reformist allies of President Mohammad Khatami won about
three-quarters of the 290 seats, seizing control of the powerful
parliament from hard-liners for the first time since the 1979
Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The Guardian Council has repeatedly been accused of tampering
with the votes to boost hard-liners.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the elections has intensified a power struggle
between reformists allied with Khatami and his program of social
and political reforms, and Islamic hard-liners trying to cling to
power.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Arrests Would-Be Immigrants  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Police arrested 210 hungry would-be
immigrants when their ship stopped at a Turkish Mediterranean
village in search of food, the Anatolia news agency said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees, who were headed for Italy, had set sail from the
port city of Antalya, 370 miles south of the capital, Ankara. The
ship docked at the village of Kapikargin, 100 miles west of
Antalya, after running out of food.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear how long the immigrants had been at
sea or when the arrests occurred. The refugees included 95 Turks,
as well as Indians, Bangladeshis, Iraqis and Moroccans. The two
Turkish captains were also arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the immigrants escaped into the wooded hills near
Kapikargin, Anatolia said.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of immigrants from Asia, the Middle East and Africa
are caught each year in Turkey as they try to enter more prosperous
European Union countries.

<HEADLINE> Hair Spurs Boy's Disqualification  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) -- Theo Sullow's victory in the first leg
of a national math competition won't get him to the next round
unless he cuts his hair, an official said.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes Garcia Guevara disqualified the 12-year-old boy from
the second round of Nicaragua's Math Olympics because his ''weird
hairdo'' -- long and parted down the middle -- did not meet the
requirements of having a ''personal presentation of a student.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia Guevara is the government representative in Esteli, where
the national competition is being held. Esteli is 90 miles north of
Managua.
</P>
<P>
   Students have marched in the streets to protest the
disqualification. And the boy's parents, originally from Germany,
said they were appealing the decision, and would ask the German
Embassy for help if they received no response.

<HEADLINE> Woman in town for Americade killed in motorcycle-car collision  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LAKE GEORGE, N.Y. (AP) - A Connecticut woman was killed and her
husband injured Saturday when their motorcycles collided with a car
that swerved into oncoming traffic on a state highway.
</P>
<P>
   Doris C. Hamann, 52, of Waterbury was thrown from her 1997
Harley-Davidson when she collided head-on with an Oldsmobile
operated by a 74-year-old Saratoga County woman. She was pronounced
dead at a local hospital. Richard C. Hamann, her husband, was
thrown from his 1985 Honda motorcycle in the same accident. He was
treated and released from the hospital after complaining of a back
injury.
</P>
<P>
   The couple was among the thousands of motorcyclists
participating in the Americade - touted as the world's largest
rally of its kind. Two motorcyclists died in separate accidents
while attending the event last year. In 1998, an Australian
attending the event died.
</P>
<P>
   Muriel Schwarz, the driver of the Oldsmobile, was treated and
released for a wrist injury. She was ticketed for failure to keep
right. Police say an investigation is under way.

<HEADLINE> Final Auction of Ceausescu Items  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) -- The Romanian government on Sunday held
its sixth and final public auction of memorabilia belonging to
former Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. His remaining
possessions will go on sale on the Internet in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The first day of the auction at the Mausoleum, which once housed
the remains of Romania's top communist leaders, netted $15,800.
Previous auctions brought the government about $625,000, said one
of the organizers, Dan Pojoranu.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the items offered Sunday had been gifts to the former
leader by the Communist Party, trade unions or companies he visited
throughout the country. They included heavy pieces of furniture
with carved images of the wild animals Ceausescu loved to hunt.
</P>
<P>
   About half the 200 items offered Sunday were sold. A doll
fetched $58 -- 37 times its starting price of $1.50. A 1974 Hillman
Hunter car donated by the deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi of
Iran sold to a foreigner for almost $4,800.
</P>
<P>
   The auctions have been held intermittently since August, and
have disposed of over 3,000 items to bidders from Western Europe,
the United States, Israel and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   After this sixth auction, memorabilia will continue to be
offered on the Internet, Podoreanu said.
</P>
<P>
   The government said it still had about 8,000 items belonging to
Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, who were executed in December 1989
during a violent anti-communist uprising.

<HEADLINE> Rockies 9, Rangers 8  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MOSSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Jeffrey Hammonds hit a two-run double and Tom
Goodwin had a two-run single in the eighth inning, rallying the
Colorado Rockies to their fourth straight win, 9-8 over the Texas
Rangers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers lost their fifth straight game, matching their
longest skid of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 8-5, Colorado loaded the bases with no outs in the
eighth on two singles and a walk off Mike Venafro.
</P>
<P>
   Hammonds greeted Tim Crabtree (1-2) with a double down the
left-field line. With two outs and the bases loaded again, Goodwin
singled to short center.
</P>
<P>
   Mike DeJean (1-1) pitched 1 2-3 innings, and Jose Jimenez
pitched the ninth to earn his 11th save, starting a 1-6-3 double
play to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   Hammonds had three hits and four RBIs, and Goodwin had three
hits and three RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Rodriguez and Luis Alicea each had four hits for Texas, and
David Segui drove in three runs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinging to a 6-5 lead, the Rangers scored twice in the seventh
on Royce Clayton's 10th homer and Alicea's RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Oliver, who missed his previously scheduled start because
of a tired left shoulder, went five innings and left with a lead,
but the Rangers bullpen couldn't hold it.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers jumped on Brian Bohanon for two runs in the first
before Bohanon could record an out. Alicea led off the game with a
single, Rusty Greer tripled past a diving Goodwin in left-center,
and Rodriguez singled up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado cut the deficit to 2-1 in the second when Jeff Cirillo
doubled, went to second on Todd Helton groundout and scored on
Hammonds' sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lamb's RBI single in the third made it 3-1, but the
Rockies got a run in their half on doubles by Neifi Perez and
Goodwin.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez got his third straight single to lead off the fifth,
reaching third when center fielder Goodwin let the ball get past
him for a two-base error. Segui made it 4-2 with an infield single.
</P>
<P>
   Texas went ahead 6-2 in the sixth. With two outs and Greer on
first, Rodriguez doubled off reliever Julian Tavarez and Segui
followed with a two-run infield single. Second baseman Terry
Shumpert dived to stop Segui's grounder but had no play.
</P>
<P>
   Bold baserunning helped the Rockies score three times in their
half to make it 6-5. Shumpert tripled and scored on Larry Walker's
single. With two outs, Walker came all the way around to score on
Hammonds' bloop single to right off Jeff Zimmerman. Hammonds went
to third on Scott Servais' single and raced home when second
baseman Alicea booted the relay from right field.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Hammonds extended his hitting streak to a career-high 11
games. ... Mike Lansing did not start for the second straight game
because of a sore lower back, but he entered Sunday's game in the
seventh. ... Goodwin committed his first error of the season and
first since May 22, 1999, when he was with Texas -- a span of 123
games. ... Gabe Kapler made a diving catch in left-center field to
rob Hammonds in the second inning, but the sacrifice fly scored
Jeff Cirillo from third. ... Chad Curtis' sliding catch near the
right-field line ended a Rockies' threat in the fourth.

<HEADLINE> Vice President Gore Hits N.Y. Media  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After a media-heavy kickoff in New York City,
Vice President Al Gore's ''progress and prosperity tour'' this week
will concentrate on the Pennsylvania and Ohio battlegrounds, aides
said.
</P>
<P>
   Together, those states offer 44 of the 270 electoral votes Gore
will need to defeat Republican presidential rival George W. Bush in
November. The most recent statewide polls suggested what amounts to
a dead heat in both states, with Bush just a whisper ahead in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Gore will deliver a health care speech in Scranton, Penn., on
Wednesday then travel to Cincinnati on Thursday to promote his
argument that narrowly targeted tax cuts -- rather than the much
broader, bigger cuts proposed by Bush -- are the way to help
families that haven't shared in the nation's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   The tour begins Tuesday with a speech -- described as a thematic
look at the big choices America faces if its prosperity is to
continue -- at 1 p.m. EDT at the New York Historical Society.
</P>
<P>
   Former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin will accompany Gore for
the first half of the week.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a way, it will remind people the economic success of the
last seven years is not an accident -- it's the result of things
that were smart and disciplined. And, hopefully, it will raise
questions about whether they want to trust the economy to someone
who doesn't necessarily have that kind of experience and
background,'' said Mark Fabiani, Gore's deputy campaign manager for
communications.
</P>
<P>
   New York, not considered a real battleground state since Gore is
presumed comfortably ahead there, was chosen because the vice
president hopes to gain big, national media coverage of this latest
effort to regenerate his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He is scheduled to spend hours on Tuesday speaking privately
with The New York Times editorial board and giving interviews to
all the major network news anchors and correspondents.
</P>
<P>
   After a weekend of planning discussions, Friday's schedule
remained up in the air but aides said Gore will campaign in the
mid-Atlantic region before taking the weekend off for Fathers' Day
and resuming his tour next week in the Midwest.

<HEADLINE> United States 3, Mexico 0  </HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Goals are aplenty for the U.S.
soccer team these days. Now if the Americans can just keep it up in
World Cup qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   On a brutally hot afternoon, the United States beat an
understrength Mexican team 3-0 Sunday to win soccer's U.S. Cup for
the first time since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because of the controversy surrounding the Mexican team, we
had everything to lose and in some ways nothing to gain,'' U.S.
coach Bruce Arena said. ''We would have been ridiculed if we didn't
win this.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian McBride scored in the 33rd minute, and Frankie Hejduk and
Ante Razov added goals in the final 15 minutes as the Americans
continued their recovery from a last-place finish in the World Cup
two years ago. It was the final tuneup for the United States before
it starts qualifying for the 2002 World Cup with a July 16 game at
Antigua or Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   ''The guys have a great understanding of each other,'' said
McBride, agreeing with the team consensus that rebuilding is nearly
done.
</P>
<P>
   The United States (4-2-3 this year) routed South Africa 4-0 last
weekend, then tied Ireland 1-1 in a downpour Tuesday. Ireland
played South Africa in the second game of Sunday's doubleheader.
</P>
<P>
   While just an exhibition tournament, Sunday's game marked a
number of milestones. Cobi Jones set a record for U.S. men with his
129th international appearance, one more than Marcelo Balboa, and
Jeff Agoos became the sixth American man to reach 100.
</P>
<P>
   On a sweltering afternoon with a game-time temperature of 90
degrees, the Americans quieted a mostly pro-Mexican crowd of
45,008.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico, which had won the previous three editions of this
tournament, didn't send its regular national team, instead
dispatching a roster stocked mostly from the club Pumas, including
the coach. Seven of the 11 starters were from that one team.
</P>
<P>
   ''It might not be all the veteran players, but they weren't bad
players,'' U.S. midfielder Claudio Reyna said.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since taking over as coach from Steve Sampson
in October 1998, Arena had most of his top players, although
Joe-Max Moore, Eddie Lewis, Eddie Pope and Robin Fraser were out
with injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Earnie Stewart filled a key playmaking role, playing after a
root canal Wednesday, a filling Thursday and oral surgery Friday.
He took an elbow to the right side of his face during the South
Africa game, damaging a nerve. Since then, his food had been
limited to bananas and other fruit, and he almost was sent home.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bruce is very clear on how he wants us to play,'' Stewart
said. ''Everybody knows his position and what he has to do in his
position.''
</P>
<P>
   McBride put the Americans ahead in the 33rd minute with his 11th
goal in 43 international appearances, scoring from 10 yards out off
a cross from Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's Christian Ramirez was ejected in the 70th minute for
getting his second yellow card, and the Americans followed with a
pair of easy goals.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Olson carried the ball up field in the 79th but goalkeeper
Sergio Bernal knocked it away -- right to Jones, whose shot bounced
off the far post. Hejduk tipped it in from inches, then broke into
an extended dance.
</P>
<P>
   Razov scored into an open net in the 85th, four minutes after he
entered the game, intercepting a backpass from Paul Cesar Chavez to
his goalkeeper.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The U.S. Soccer Federation planned to announce Monday to
the sites for home games in the semifinals of World Cup qualifying
in the North and Central American and Caribbean region. After
opening at Guatemala or Antigua and playing at Costa Rica on July
23, the Americans play Barbados at Foxboro, Mass., on Aug. 16,
Guatemala or Antigua on Sept. 3 at Washington and Costa Rica on
Oct. 11 at Columbus, Ohio. The round concludes with a game at
Barbados on Nov. 14 or 15. The top two teams in the group advance
to next year's six-nation regional finals, which will produce three
qualifiers. ... Jones, who plays for Los Angeles in Major League
Soccer, said four foreign teams had scouts at the game to watch
him.

U.S. Seeks Immunity From U.N. Court
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United Nations is in the process of establishing a
permanent international criminal court aimed at holding accountable those
responsible for actions deemed to be war crimes or crimes against humanity.
While offering millions to track down war crimes suspects in the Balkans, the
United States is trying to carve out a blanket exemption protecting American
soldiers from being hunted down and prosecuted by the new U.N. court. State
Department lawyers are beginning the effort tomorrow at the United Nations.
Human rights experts fear the U.S. example will encourage other countries, like
Iraq, to follow suit and undercut the United Nations' campaign against war
crimes.

Study: Most Death Row Cases Flawed
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two-thirds of death penalty cases that were appealed from
1973 through 1995 were successful, report researchers who contend the nation's
capital punishment system is ''collapsing under the weight of its own
mistakes.'' A study of 4,578 appeals during those years showed that most cases
''are so seriously flawed that they have to be done over again,'' said Columbia
University law professor James Liebman, the lead author. The study comes at a
time of increased debate over capital punishment. Texas Gov. George W. Bush
recently approved his first 30-day reprieve in a death penalty case -- to allow
time for DNA testing -- after permitting 131 executions. But public support for
capital punishment remains high.

Rwanda Routs Ugandan Forces
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   KISANGANI, Congo (AP) -- Rwandan troops drove Ugandan forces from Kisangani
on Sunday in a fierce seven-hour battle that ended a week of terrifying,
indiscriminate shelling and enabled the United Nations to deploy between the two
armies and prepare for their withdrawal. The bullet-riddled bodies of at least
40 Ugandan soldiers lay strewn along the gravel road that leads up to the bridge
where Rwandan troops halted the Ugandan push into the city. The stench of death
was everywhere in this Congo River port city, and there was no water,
electricity, food or medicine.

Assad's Son Named Commander of Armed Forces
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -- Bashar Assad, son of the late Syrian leader, was
unanimously nominated as the only presidential candidate Sunday, another
indication he will succeed his father. The ruling Baath Party also appointed
Bashar commander of the armed forces. President Hafez Assad, who died Saturday,
was the previous commander. In anointing Bashar Assad, the hierarchy is opting
for a smooth, stable transition -- instead of the uncertainty and violence that
characterized power changes in Syria before Hafez Assad took over in a bloodless
coup in 1970. All that is left is for the rubber-stamp parliament, which is
scheduled to meet June 25, to approve the nomination and for elections to be
held.

Iranian Defector Said an Impostor
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The CIA and FBI reportedly have concluded that an Iranian
defector who claims to be a former intelligence official and terrorist
mastermind is an impostor. The defector claimed to have masterminded the 1988
bombing of a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, and the 1996 attack against a
U.S. military installation in Saudi Arabia. Two Libyans are now on trial for the
Pan Am bombing. A U.S. intelligence official quoted anonymously in The
Washington Post today said the CIA and FBI concluded the defector lied during
interviews with intelligence officials and lacked basic knowledge of Iran's
intelligence apparatus.

Gas Prices Jump Nearly 9 Cents

<P>
   CAMARILLO, Calif. (AP) -- Gasoline prices climbed 8.82 cents a gallon in the
past three weeks as a new kind of reformulated gas made its way to the pumps,
giving some cities an average price of more than $2 a gallon. High crude oil
prices, rising demand and new antismog regulations affecting 17 metropolitan
areas pushed the nationwide average cost to $1.6723 a gallon Friday, analyst
Trilby Lundberg said today. That compares to the May 19 Lundberg Survey of
10,000 stations nationwide that found a national average of $1.5841.

a three-game sweep in the crosstown series. The loss snapped a six-game winning
streak for the White Sox and spoiled a two-homer day by Jose Valentin. The White
Sox also got home runs from Ray Durham, Frank Thomas and Magglio Ordonez.

<HEADLINE> Stanley Cup Notebook  </HEADLINE>
By IRA PODELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- The New Jersey Devils know how to disappoint the
home fans -- theirs and those in enemy arenas.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils won their second Stanley Cup, defeating the defending
champion Dallas Stars 2-1 Saturday night in double overtime of Game
6. New Jersey won for a record-tying 10th time in 12 road playoff
games, compared to a 6-5 mark at home.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am not surprised, but then I am,'' said Randy McKay, of the
Devils, who won three times at Dallas in the best-of-seven finals.
''We knew Dallas had an unbelievable home record (9-1 in the first
three rounds).
</P>
<P>
   ''To come in here and win all three games is a little
surprising.''
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey, which lost at home in Game 5 in triple overtime with
a chance to win the Cup, equaled the NHL mark for road playoff
wins, established by the Devils championship team in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ''This time around, I think I realize it a little bit more,''
said goalie Martin Brodeur, one of eight players who also won in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils, who swept the Red Wings to win their first Cup, are
5-0 on the road in the finals. They are the sixth team to win three
road games in the finals.
</P>
<P>
   ''To lose three at home was something that we never imagined
would happen,'' Stars forward Mike Modano said. ''That was real
tough. To come back and win Game 2 after being blown out and give
ourselves a chance to win our home games and get that home ice.
Letting it go like that is really tough.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   EVEN UP: In the last two games of their series, the Devils and
Stars were tied for a remarkable 193 minutes and 32 seconds of the
final 194:41 -- spanning parts of 11 periods.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 5 Thursday night, the teams were scoreless until Modano
won it at 6:21 of triple overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Two nights later, Scott Niedermayer gave the Devils a 1-0 lead
5:18 in the second. But Mike Keane answered just 69 seconds later.
It remained 1-1 until Jason Arnott got the Cup-winner at 8:20 of
the second overtime.
</P>
<P>
   It was only the second time, and first in the modern
best-of-seven era, that consecutive games of the Stanley Cup finals
went multiple extra sessions. In 1931, Montreal and Chicago needed
two overtimes in Game 2 and three in the third game.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles and Montreal were the last teams to play consecutive
overtime games in the finals, when they played past regulation in
Games 2, 3 and 4 in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   LATE-NIGHT NHL: Arnott's goal was the third to win the Cup
late at night in the last five years. Uwe Krupp scored a
triple-overtime goal in 1996 for the Colorado Avalanche and Brett
Hull's controversial goal in a third overtime gave the title to the
Stars last year.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   OUTSHOOTING STARS: The Devils outshot the Stars 45-31 in the
sixth and final game and held a 209-147 advantage in the series.
New Jersey had more shots than its opponent in 20 of 23 playoff
games, including each contest against Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   TOP COMPETITION: Not only did the Devils have to knock off the
defending champs to capture the Stanley Cup, they had to go through
two other clubs that earned over 100 points in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey became the second team to beat three 100-point teams
in the playoffs by eliminating Northeast Division winner Toronto
(100) in the second round and Philadelphia (105), the Eastern
Conference's top seed in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas, the Pacific Division champion, had 102 points.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone's gunning for you and it's a long grind,'' said Mike
Keane, who scored Dallas' lone goal Saturday night. ''If we would
have won, this would have been the most satisfying because we know
how hard it is. Once again we had a great chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1980 New York Islanders also defeated three 100-point clubs
en route to the first of their four straight Stanley Cups.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   POWER OUTAGE: Dallas converted only twice in 16 power plays
against New Jersey. In fact, the Stars allowed just as many
short-handed goals to the Devils -- including John Madden's
game-winner in Game 4 and Scott Niedermayer's tally in Game 6 that
made it 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils had the best penalty-killing unit in the playoffs,
killing off 62 of 67 short-handed opportunities (92.5 percent). The
five power-play goals yielded were the fewest by a finalist since
the playoffs went to four rounds for all teams in 1980.

<HEADLINE> Devils Return Home With Stanley Cup  </HEADLINE>
By NINA RIZZO
<TEXT>
<P>
   TETERBORO, N.J. (AP) -- The New Jersey Devils returned home as
champions Sunday, hoisting the Stanley Cup high above their heads
as they got off a plane that carried them home from an overtime
triumph in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Arnott held the cup aloft as about two dozen fans cheered
in heat and humidity as stifling as the Devils' defense.
</P>
<P>
   The temperature was in the mid-90s when the team's chartered jet
touched down at about 3:45 p.m. at Teterboro Airport, a small
airfield used by many business, entertainment and sports figures
seeking an alternative to huge commercial airports.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Postolwski, a computer artist from Mahwah, N.J., came with
a camera to get some snapshots.
</P>
<P>
   ''They showed a lot of heart to stick it in there when everyone
was writing them off,'' he said. ''It took a lot of guts and
courage.''
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen-year-old Kevin Makely of Hasbrouck Heights had a simple
goal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just want to touch the cup,'' he said. He didn't get to
touch it, but he stood and cheered at the exit of the Atlantic
Aviation terminal as the team's bus pulled out, en route to the
Continental Airlines Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a hard-fought series,'' said James Vera, 32. His aunt,
Sonia Fuentes, 57, of Hackensack, raised both fists and said, ''I'm
here to root the team on.''
</P>
<P>
   Christine Maita, a 26-year-old nurse from Little Ferry, brought
a Ken Daneyko jersey with her, but it was too hot to wear, so she
sat on it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd just like to see them and get an autograph, but I don't
think it will happen,'' Maita said.
</P>
<P>
   A few lucky fans who gathered outside the arena did manage to
get autographs as the players scampered off the team bus toward
their cars.
</P>
<P>
   Petr Sykora, who was hospitalized for observation Saturday night
after taking a blow to the head from Stars captain Derian Hatcher
in the first period, accompanied the team on the flight home, but
went straight to his car, still suffering from a headache.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, were glad to oblige the fans.
</P>
<P>
   ''Words can't describe it,'' Daneyko said of his feeling after
clinching the cup. ''This one was something special. The guys were
unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It feels great,'' Arnott added. ''It's a dream come true.
Every player dreams about this. The last couple of years, we had
something to prove.''
</P>
<P>
   Devils general manager Lou Lamoriello said the team never lost
its poise. He also said the team's second Stanley Cup was harder to
get than the first one in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone says it's more difficult when you've never won it
before,'' he said. ''But in my mind, the second one is harder
because you're expected to win it. And then if you don't, they
suspect something's wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is tremendous for hockey, and tremendous for the local
market and the fans. This was a special feat because we dethroned
last year's champions.''

<HEADLINE> Assad Death Could Destabilize Syria  </HEADLINE>
By BASSEM MROUE
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- President Hosni Mubarak devoted a special
Cabinet meeting Sunday to Syria, concerned that the fellow Arab
nation's stability could be at risk after the death of its leader,
Hafez Assad.
</P>
<P>
   Just one day after Assad's death at age 69, Syria's ruling Baath
Party unanimously nominated his son Bashar, a 34-year-old
ophthalmologist, for president. Assad had groomed Bashar for the
post.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are hearing that there is a candidate who is Dr. Bashar
Assad, and we wish him all the best,'' Mubarak told reporters after
the Cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Syria was the only subject of discussion at Sunday's meeting
''because (Assad's death) is a huge incident,'' he said. Assad
ruled Syria for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were shocked by the death of a colleague and a brother,''
Mubarak said. ''We hope from deep in our hearts that Syria will be
stable, and we will support the leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Expressions of sorrow and words of praise for Assad continued
Sunday from leaders and commentators in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Arab world analysts expected Bashar would become Syria's next
leader, though some expressed fears he would not ascend
unchallenged. Besides the uncertainty of his support among the
military, Bashar's uncle, Rifaat, attempted a coup against his
brother in 1984 and is thought to still harbor leadership
ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   ''The struggle for power between the old guard and the new will
not be a picnic or a walk in the park. The price will be dear, very
dear. May God protect Syria and its people from all evil,''
columnist Fouad al-Hashem wrote in Sunday's edition of the Kuwaiti
daily Al-Watan.
</P>
<P>
   Assad's final months were dominated by efforts to secure the
return of the Golan Heights, which Israel seized in the 1967 Middle
East war. Talks had been stalled since January, but despite his
failing health, Assad wouldn't be pressured to bend.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Justice Minister Yossi Beilin said in Jerusalem that
Bashar Assad could smooth the way for a peace arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be easier for a new generation that is not part of the
rejectionist camp to comply with the existence of Israel,'' said
Beilin, who described the elder Assad as an enemy of Israel
respected as the legitimate leader of a neighboring state.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak and his army commanders have said they
hope for stability. ''We hope the Syrian leadership will remain
stable and the situation will remain stable until a successor is
chosen,'' said Maj. Gen. Gabi Ashkenazi, who commands forces in
Israel's north.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli military officials said they expected the younger Assad
to maintain his father's policies, and noted reports that the elder
Assad had in recent months purged his regime of threats to Bashar's
succession.
</P>
<P>
   The Jordan Times, an Amman-based English-language newspaper,
said that whoever assumed the Syrian presidency would also have
domestic concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hafez Assad's successor will inherit a country with the
diseases that are almost typical in this region: Corruption, a
struggling economy in need of modernization and liberalization, and
the challenges of democratization lying ahead,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed al-Jarrallah, editor in chief of another Kuwait daily
Al-Siyassah, suggested Bashar was ready for such challenges. Bashar
has been leading a campaign against corruption in Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Bashar ''is his father's son and a graduate of his school,'' he
wrote in a signed editorial Sunday. Bashar ''has the benefit of a
young mentality, the higher ability to modernize and the total
acceptance of the facts of the world.''

<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Ruthie Bolton-Holifield scored seven
points over the final 1:38 and the Sacramento Monarchs beat Los
Angeles 75-68 on Sunday, handing the Sparks their first loss of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Bolton-Holifield had missed the previous two games with
arthritis in her right knee, but she came back in top form,
finishing with 17 points, six rebounds and three assists.
</P>
<P>
   Kedra Holland-Corn led Sacramento (3-3) with 23 points, 17 in
the first half, and Yolanda Griffith had 11 points and eight
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Leslie topped Los Angeles (4-1) with 19 points and 11
rebounds, and Tamecka Dixon had 15 points.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles had an eight-point lead with 10 minutes remaining,
but the Monarchs chipped away until Bolton-Holifield's 3-pointer
with 4:40 to play gave them the lead for good.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Monarchs built an early 12-4 lead, the game was close
throughout the first half and early in the second until a 13-3 run
gave Los Angeles an eight-point lead.

<HEADLINE> Pirates 10, Royals 6, 10 innings  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG TUCKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Brian Giles hit a tying double in the
ninth inning and homered during a five-run 10th as the Pittsburgh
Pirates beat Kansas City 10-6 Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   All three games of the series went into extra innings. The
Royals, trying to finish off their first interleague sweep ever,
took a 5-4 lead into the ninth before Giles doubled off rookie Jeff
D'Amico.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Morris, who was 4-for-6 after going 5-for-6 on Saturday,
committed a fielding error at second base that helped the Royals
score three times in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Facing Jerry Spradlin (2-2) in the 10th, Morris hit a two-run
double over the head of center fielder Carlos Beltran. Adrian
Brown, who had a career-high four hits, singled home Morris and
Giles followed with a two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   Giles, who started the day tied for the NL RBIs lead with 57,
was 2-for-6. Morris was 11-for-17 with three RBIs in the series.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Damon had an RBI double in the seventh and later made it
4-all on Mike Sweeney's infield out. Jermaine Dye's RBI single gave
the Royals the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Winner Scott Sauerbeck (3-0) pitched two innings of one-hit
relief.
</P>
<P>
   Starter Francisco Cordova, trying for a career-high fourth
straight victory, gave up five runs on seven hits through six
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Two Kansas City errors led to three unearned runs in the first.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Dunwoody, making his second start in left field, bobbled
Brown's liner as Morris scored all the way from first.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after Wil Cordero was safe on third baseman Joe Randa's
fielding error, Kevin Young and Luis Sojo hit RBI singles with two
out.
</P>
<P>
   In the Royals first, Sanchez had an RBI double and scored on
Beltran's single to make it 3-2. Brown and Cordero hit consecutive
doubles in the second for a 4-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Royals starter Jay Witasick went six innings and gave up four
runs -- only one earned -- on 11 hits. Dunwoody hit his first home
run in the 10th for the Royals.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Rain delayed the start of the game 34 minutes. ... Royals
1B Sweeney, No. 2 on the AL RBI list, made a standout catch to rob
Giles of a run batted in. With two out in the second inning, Giles
hit a line smash that Sweeney caught by diving to his right and
doing a bellyflop. ... It was Damon's third game as DH. ... John
Vander Wal, after doubling in the Pittsburgh fifth, was easily
thrown out a moment later by starter Jay Witasick while trying to
steal third, costing the Pirates a run when Young then singled. ...
Young stole his first three bases of the year in this series.

<HEADLINE> Athletics 6, Dodgers 0  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Kevin Appier earned his 11th career shutout,
ending a drought of 36 starts without a complete game, and Miguel
Tejada highlighted a five-run first inning with a two-run double as
the Oakland Athletics beat the Los Angeles Dodgers 6-0 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Appier (6-3) scattered seven hits, struck out six and walked one
while improving his road record to 5-0. The shutout was his first
in 75 starts since May 5, 1997, when he pitched Kansas City to a
2-0 victory at Boston with a five-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   The 32-year-old right-hander was staked to a 5-0 lead before
throwing his first pitch ever against the Dodgers. He also got his
first major league hit, a fourth-inning single.
</P>
<P>
   Appier's complete-game shutout was the first by an Oakland
pitcher since Sept. 4, 1998 when Kenny Rogers beat Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Eric Gagne (1-4) failed to retire any of the first five
batters while loading the bases with consecutive walks. Terrence
Long, who opened the game with a single, scored when Gagne grazed
cleanup hitter Matt Stairs above the right elbow with a 2-2 pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Tejada made it 3-0 with a double to right-center and Eric Chavez
capped the rally with a two-out, two-run single that extended his
hitting streak to 10 games -- the longest of his career and the
longest of any Oakland batter this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Athletics, who have won nine of 11, scored their sixth run
on a double steal in the fifth. Jason Giambi led off with a double,
then beat the throw to third from catcher Paul LoDuca on a short
wild pitch to the right of the plate with two out. Ben Grieve was
intentionally walked, then broke for second as Giambi beat the
return throw home from second baseman Mark Grudzielanek.
</P>
<P>
   Gagne was charged with six runs and six hits in five innings,
striking out six and walking four.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Dodgers will reach the one-million mark in home
attendance on Monday night when they host the NL West-leading
Arizona Diamondbacks in the opener of a four-game series. ...
Appier had pitched only one other complete game in the last three
seasons, a three-hit, 7-1 victory on May 12, 1999, for the Royals
against Toronto. All three hits in that game were by current Dodger
Shawn Green, who had a first-inning double on Sunday. ... Giambi
drew three walks, increasing his AL-leading total to 53. He had 105
bases on balls last season. ... Appier has received at least six
runs of support in six of his 11 starts this season.

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Alex Rodriguez doubled twice, singled and
drove in three runs Sunday, leading the Seattle Mariners over the
San Francisco Giants 9-2.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Lampkin hit a tiebreaking, bases-loaded triple in the
seventh inning that broke a 2-2 lead. Rodriguez drew a two-out walk
to begin the burst as the Mariners won a series from the Giants for
the first time ever.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Sele (7-2) won his fifth straight decision and has not
lost since May 5, a span of eight starts. He gave up two runs on
six hits and two walks
</P>
<P>
   Livan Hernandez (4-6) lost for the first time since May 14, six
starts ago. He allowed five runs on nine hits and a career-high
seven walks.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs in the seventh, Rodriguez and Jay Buhner walked
around a single by John Olerud.
</P>
<P>
   Lampkin then drove a 1-2 offering from Hernandez halfway up the
right-field wall. The ball caromed back toward the infield before
Armando Rios could track it down, allowing Lampkin, a former Giant,
to reach third.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez gave the Mariners a 1-0 lead in the first with a
one-out double to score Mark McLemore.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Bonds hit a sacrifice fly in the first as Marvin Benard
scored for the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   McLemore had a one-out double in the third and scored when
Rodriguez doubled.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, who singled in a run in the eighth, reached base in
seven straight plate appearances -- he reached safely all five at
bats Saturday -- before striking out in the fifth. He was on base 10
of 15 times in the series.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Kent drove home Benard with a sacrifice fly in the third
for his league-leading 58th RBI.
</P>
<P>
   McLemore added a run-scoring single in the eighth and a
sacrifice fly in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Martinez had a pinch-hit sacrifice fly for his AL-leading
64th RBI. It was also just the second pinch-hit RBI of the season
for the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
Notes:  Seattle pinch-hitters are batting .111 (4-for-36) and are
hitless in their last 15 at-bats with two walks and a sacrifice fly
dating to May 27. ... The Mariners won just their second of 11
interleague series played in NL parks. ... The Giants have 12 blown
saves, putting them on pace for 35. The record is 31, set by the
1998 Cardinals. ... Hernandez has not won a road game since last
Aug. 21 in Milwaukee, a span of nine starts.

<HEADLINE> High temps near record in N.J.; storm on way  </HEADLINE>
By WAYNE PARRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Temperatures approached record highs in
much of New Jersey Sunday as the state braced for severe
thunderstorms that were poised to cool things down.
</P>
<P>
   The mercury reached 95 degrees in Newark, and was at 92 in
Teterboro as of 3 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   State environmental authorities issued an air pollution advisory
warning of unhealthy air over most of the state. And a series of
severe thunderstorms was forecast for northern and coastal New
Jersey for later in the day.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen die-hard New Jersey Devils fans braved scorching
temperatures and stifling humidity to turn out at Teterboro
Airport, where the team's chartered jet was to land after the team
won the Stanley Cup early Sunday in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just want to touch the cup,'' said 18-year-old Kevin Makely
of Hasbrouck Heights.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Olympic rowing team trials were held earlier than
scheduled Sunday because of the heat, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The heat caused a drawbridge over the Manasquan River in Brielle
to expand, preventing it from closing, a police dispatcher said.
The bridge, on Route 70, was stuck open for almost two hours,
causing a traffic nightmare for beachgoers leaving the Shore.
Workers managed to get the bridge closed just before 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Environmental Protection said concentrations
of ozone had reached unhealthy levels in Camden and Gloucester
counties, and was approaching that level in Ocean County. Such
levels can cause coughing, chest pains, decreased lung function,
shortness of breath, and can aggravate asthma and other respiratory
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Children, senior citizens and those with existing respiratory
diseases are considered the most at risk.
</P>
<P>
   State officials also said air quality in northeastern and
southerwestern New Jersey were poor because of high levels of fine
particulates.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service issued an excessive heat warning
for urban areas. And it also issued a severe thunderstorm watch for
northern New Jersey and coastal areas from 2:15 p.m. to 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Two-inch hail, dangerous lightning and wind gusts of up to 70
m.p.h. were forecast. Winds are considered hurricane-force when
they reach 74 m.p.h.
</P>
<P>
   Once the storms pass, Monday's high temperatures are expected to
be around 80 in much of the state.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) -- Don Smith and Aquil Abdullah will face off
once again Monday to complete the U.S. Rowing Olympic team. Eight
of the nine crews for Olympic team were selected Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The second-seeded Smith finished in 6:57.96 to edge the
top-seeded Abdullah by 3.75 seconds. Abdullah won the first final,
but suffered an asthma attack on Sunday, forcing a third final. The
winner of that race will go to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   In the women's single sculls, top-seeded Monica Tranel-Michini
clocked a 7:35.23 to finish 5.11 seconds ahead of second-place Lisa
Schlenker.
</P>
<P>
   Tranel-Michini, a 1996 Olympian in the women's eight, will
travel to the European Olympic Qualifying Regatta in Lucerne,
Switzerland, in July to qualify the boat for the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Tucker and Conal Groom, the top seeds in the men's
lightweight double sculls, won a close race by 1.48 seconds. Tucker
and Groom clocked a 6:13.86 to best Bill Belden and Greg Ruckman.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker and Groom finished sixth at the 1999 World Championships
and qualified the boat for the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   In the women's double sculls, Ruth Davidon and Carol Skricki won
in 6:56.04, beating Leslie Rawley and Kate MacKenzie by 2.52
seconds. Davidon and Skricki will travel to Lucerne to qualify the
boat.
</P>
<P>
   Top seeds Mike Ferry and Henry Nuzum won the second final of the
men's double sculls in 6:12.09, edging David Gleeson and Chris
Duffy by 3.18 seconds. The United States already has qualified for
the Games in the double, so Ferry and Nuzum will go to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   In the women's lightweight double sculls, Sarah Garner and
Christine Collins won in 6:50.58. Angie Cummins and Whitney Post
finished second in 6:53.94. Garner and Collins, the 1999 world
silver medalists in the event, have already qualified their boat
for the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Kraft and Missy Ryan, 1996 Olympic silver medalists in the
event, captured the second final of the women's pair. Their 6:59.57
was good for a 6.99-second victory over Lianne Nelson and Katie
Maloney.
</P>
<P>
   On the men's side, No. 1 seeds Ted Murphy and Sebastian Bea
finished in 6:18.02 in the closest race of the day. A photo finish
showed a 0.23-second edge over second-place finishers Thomas Bohrer
and Adam Holland. Murphy and Bea will travel to Lucerne to attempt
to qualify the boat for the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   In the men's quadruple sculls, Nick Peterson, Ian McGowan, Jake
Wetzel and Sean Hall of the Augusta Training Center finished in
5:42.83 -- 4.96 seconds ahead of the Princeton Training Center boat.
The Augusta boat will travel to Lucerne to attempt to qualify for
the Games.

<HEADLINE> Chavez Praises Andean Counterparts  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER TOOTHAKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- President Hugo Chavez on Sunday
praised his Andean counterparts for asserting their independence
from the United States by resisting U.S. pressure to condemn
President Alberto Fujimori's recent victory in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, a left-leaning nationalist who led a botched coup
attempt in 1992 and was elected president in December 1998,
stressed that the United States has no business getting involved in
Peru's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we had left Peru alone in the face of pressure by the
United States, it (Peru) would be on its knees right now,'' Chavez
said upon arriving in Venezuela after attending a two-day summit in
Lima, Peru.
</P>
<P>
   ''The dominance of the imperalists must be left behind,'' Chavez
said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government harshly criticized Fujimori's re-election in
a May 28 vote which was boycotted by his main rival, Alejandro
Toledo, who claimed the poll was rigged.
</P>
<P>
   The United States called on the Organization of American States,
or OAS, to apply economic and political sanctions in an effort to
isolate the Andean country. However, the OAS stopped short of
questioning Fujimori's victory or imposing sanctions. Instead it
resolved to send a high-level mission to Peru to work on
strengthening democratic institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Amid this backdrop, the presidents of Bolivia, Colombia,
Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela signed a document Saturday
establishing ''the principle of nonintervention'' in these Andean
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, who was sworn in as president of the Andean Community
during the summit, said that cooperation between Andean nations is
necessary to curb the dominance of the United States in
international affairs.
</P>
<P>
   He also stressed that opposing a ''unipolar'' world dominated by
a single superpower will benefit the Andean nations in general, not
only Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts in Venezuela believe that the pact could
strengthen Chavez' diplomatic muscle in the troubled region.
</P>
<P>
   Fausto Maso, a highly respected political analyst and columnist
for daily El Nacional newspaper, said that the pact will ''lessen
the cost'' of diplomatic conflicts with the United States, because
Venezuela will be able to count on support from its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   However, Maso said it is unlikely that the pact will hamper
U.S.-Venezuelan relations or foreign investment in this oil-rich
but poverty-stricken nation of 23 million,
</P>
<P>
   ''This (pact) constitutes low intensity anti-imperialism, it is
not like Fidel Castro in 1958. The Americans should not be losing
sleep over this,'' Maso said.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, a spokesman said the U.S. State Department had no
comment on Chavez' statements.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the Andean Community are slated to meet July
24 in Caracas on July 24 continue discussions on economic and
political integration in the region.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Allies Claim Vote-Buying  </HEADLINE>
By KATARINA KRATOVAC
<TEXT>
<P>
   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Allies of President Slobodan
Milosevic accused the West of using financial aid to buy votes in
Montenegro's local elections, which were held Sunday in two cities
and were seen as a referendum on the republic's pro-Western
policies.
</P>
<P>
   Voting reportedly went smoothly in the Montenegrin capital,
Podgorica, and the coastal town of Herceg Novi. After the polls
closed, however, police had to separate pro-and anti-Milosevic
groups in Podgorica as tensions rose.
</P>
<P>
   First returns were not expected before early Monday. However,
anti-Milosevic groups, confident of victory in Podgorica, drove in
convoys throughout the city, honking horns in celebration.
</P>
<P>
   That provoked an angry response from their opponents, who hurled
drink cans at the cars of their rivals as they drove past the
headquarters of the pro-Belgrade party where about 500 supporters
of the Yugoslav president had gathered.
</P>
<P>
   Although the elections were for local posts, the two towns
account for one-third of the republic's registered voters. As a
result, Sunday's elections provided the first electoral test for
supporters of Montenegro's pro-Western President Milo Djukanovic,
who took office in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Turnout was between 75 and 80 percent in Podgorica and 70
percent in Herceg Novi, Montenegro's election commission said.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 109 international observers monitored the ballot,
along with 309 Montenegrin monitors from all political parties.
</P>
<P>
   After casting his own ballot, Yugoslavia's Prime Minister Momir
Bulatovic accused the United States and the European Union of
spending $20 million in Montenegro with the ''aim of buying
votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Bulatovic, a close aide to Milosevic, was referring to large
amounts of international aid that have enabled Djukanovic's
government to pay salaries double those of state employees in
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ''What is happening now is really indecent,'' Bulatovic said.
''We see foreign centers of financial and political power pouring
money in and giving false promises.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Djukanovic's supporters appeared confident they
would win endorsement for policies that have given Montenegro
virtual independence from the central Yugoslav government in
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic arrived at a downtown Podgorica polling station
Sunday afternoon, driving his black limousine and flanked by
bodyguards and his wife, Lidija.
</P>
<P>
   ''Results of these elections should be a major contribution to
furthering democracy and political stability in Montenegro,''
Djukanovic said after voting.
</P>
<P>
   A strong showing by Djukanovic's Democratic Party of Socialists
and its ''For a Better Life'' coalition would solidify his grip on
power, despite opposition from Milosevic's allies.
</P>
<P>
   Bulatovic heads the pro-Milosevic bloc, which has campaigned for
''Yugoslav patriotism'' and closer ties to Milosevic and Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The bloc consistently echoes Milosevic's anti-Western stand. If
victorious in Sunday's election, it could seriously undermine the
reformist government and its policies.
</P>
<P>
   Some also feared that the ballot could lead to violence if
Bulatovic's coalition refused to accept a defeat.

<HEADLINE> N.H. Court May Not Question Souter  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Members of a legislative committee
investigating alleged ethics violations by the state Supreme Court
say they aren't likely to question the court's best-known former
member, now-U.S. Supreme Court Justice David Souter.
</P>
<P>
   Deposition transcripts released Friday suggest Souter, who was
on the state Supreme Court in the 1980s, played a significant role
in a 13-year-old legal case at the heart of an impeachment inquiry
involving the state's highest court.
</P>
<P>
   Souter wrote the decision in the 1987 case and later insisted on
an investigation into allegations that Chief Justice David Brock
and Superior Court Judge Douglas Gray acted improperly.
</P>
<P>
   Brock was accused of calling Gray about a case involving the
Senate Majority Leader at that time and reminding him that the
politician could help win pay raises for the bench. Brock has
denied making the call.
</P>
<P>
   The Majority Leader later accused Gray of making improper
remarks to lawyers in the case. Normally, it would have been
investigated by the court's Judicial Conduct Committee, but the
statute of limitations expired. Instead, the court itself
investigated.
</P>
<P>
   The justices concluded that Gray made the comments, but also
determined he had reason to make them based on the call from Brock.
They then dropped the matter, saying Gray did not feel pressured,
and the evidence wouldn't support a finding that Brock acted
unethically.
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee has interviewed all other judges
who were on the court in 1987, but has decided against interviewing
Souter.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know why we would make this man come up from
Washington and put on an exhibit here,'' the committee's chairman,
Rep. Henry Mock, R-Jackson, said in Sunday's Concord Monitor.
''What can be added that we don't already know?''
</P>
<P>
   Souter has repeatedly declined to comment on the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   According to Richard Hesse, a professor at Franklin Pierce Law
Center, there is no privilege or law that would prevent the
committee from calling a sitting U.S. Supreme Court justice to
testify.
</P>
<P>
   The committee begins two weeks of public testimony about the
allegations on Tuesday and is expect to focus on the 1987 case.

<HEADLINE> Padres 4, Astros 1  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Tony Gwynn singled home the go-ahead run in the
eighth inning and the San Diego Padres beat the Houston Astros 4-1
Sunday, handing Jose Lima his ninth straight loss.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Astros rookie catcher Mitch Meluskey punched
teammate Matt Mieske in an altercation at the batting cage. Mieske,
an outfielder, was cut over his left eye.
</P>
<P>
   With the score tied at 1, Al Martin doubled with one out in the
eighth to chase Lima (1-9) and start a three-run inning. Marc
Valdes came on to face Gwynn, who hit a 1-1 pitch to right field.
</P>
<P>
   Martin scored just ahead of Richard Hidalgo's one-hop throw
home. Gwynn took second on the throw and made way for pinch-runner
Kory DeHaan.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn, bothered by a degenerative left knee, has driven in runs
in the last four games in which he's played. Before that, he had
gone nine starts without an RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Hernandez singled with two outs and the bases loaded to
drive in two runs, which were unearned because of third baseman Ken
Caminiti's error on Phil Nevin's grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn, Martin and Hernandez finished with two hits apiece as the
Padres won two of three against the Astros, who have the worst
record in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   Lima hasn't won since his first start of the season on April 5,
a string that includes three losses to the Padres. He did go 7 1-3
innings for the second straight start, the longest he's lasted this
season. He allowed two runs on eight hits, struck out five and
walked none.
</P>
<P>
   With runners on first and second, Kevin Walker (2-0) came on and
got the last out of the eighth for the victory. Trevor Hoffman
pitched a perfect ninth for his 14th save in 15 opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego went ahead 1-0 in the first when Martin singled with
one out and scored on Phil Nevin's two-out double to right-center.
</P>
<P>
   Houston tied it in the fourth when three straight Astros reached
base against rookie Adam Eaton with one out. Lance Berkman walked,
Daryle Ward singled and Tony Eusebio hit an RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros loaded the bases in the third on two walks and a
single by Craig Biggio, but Eaton struck out Jeff Bagwell to end
the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton got his second straight no-decision after winning his
major league debut on May 30. He allowed one run and four hits in
seven innings, struck out four and walked three.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Meluskey struck out as a pinch-hitter to end the game.
Mieske did not play. ... When INF Tim Bogar was warming up in the
bullpen during Saturday night's 13-3 loss to San Diego, he had
reliever Chris Holt team him how to throw a sinker. Bogar then went
out and pitched a perfect eighth inning, becoming the first Astros
position player since John Cangelosi in 1995 to pitch. ... With RH
reliever Carlos Reyes making his 2000 debut on Saturday night, the
Padres have had 38 players -- and 20 pitchers -- appear in at least
one game this season. The club record is 48, set in 1991. ... With
one out and a runner on first, Lima popped up a bunt to first
baseman Ryan Klesko in the seventh and stopped running. Klesko
dropped the ball, then alertly threw to second to start an
inning-ending double play. ... It was just the third time in 13
starts and the second straight in which Lima has allowed a homer.
He leads the majors with 22 allowed.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Church Warns vs. Vote Fraud  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexico's Catholic Church plans to blanket its
parishes with warnings against electoral fraud in the run-up to the
presidential elections, the Mexican media reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''To collaborate directly or indirectly in electoral fraud is a
serious sin that harms human rights and offends God,'' read posters
that the Catholic Church, which has started playing a more public
role in national life, will put up in 7,000 parishes in the weeks
leading up to the July 2 elections, the Reforma newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico is in the midst of the country's most hotly contested
presidential race ever. Francisco Labastida of the PRI, which has
governed the country for 71 years, is running neck and neck in the
polls with opposition candidate Vicente Fox of the National Action
Party.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Mexico is expected to have its cleanest
election day ever thanks to a new independent elections institute.
But officials have expressed concern about dirty campaign tactics
and accusations of coercion.
</P>
<P>
   Parishes in the major cities of this predominantly Catholic
country in upcoming weeks also will hold workshops on ''political
education and citizen awareness,'' Reforma reported.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, residents in southern Mexico released two people
Sunday after holding them overnight against their will for
campaigning for the ruling party, the government news agency
Notimex reported.
</P>
<P>
   Caralampio Lopez Rodriguez and Manuela Amparo Garcia were let go
Sunday morning -- about 12 hours after residents detained them. But
first they were forced to tear down the campaign posters they had
hung for PRI in the village of Espiritu Santo in the southern
Mexican state of Chiapas, Notimex reported.
</P>
<P>
   The village is a stronghold of the leftist Democratic Revolution
Party, whose presidential candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas is running
a distant third in the polls, Notimex reported.
</P>
<P>
   In the city of Nogales on the Mexico-Arizona border, police
arrested a woman with a pistol hidden under her vest at a campaign
rally for Labastida, Notimex also reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The woman did not say why she showed up to the event with a gun,
but she appeared to be psychologically unstable, Notimex quoted
police as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio was
shot to death at a campaign rally in the Mexican border city of
Tijuana.

<HEADLINE> Pacers Lead Lakers 23-15 After 1Q  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- A boisterous home crowd and hot shooting
from Indiana's stars helped the Pacers take a 23-15 lead over the
Los Angeles Lakers after the first quarter in Game 3 of the NBA
Finals on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant's sprained left ankle kept him out of the Lakers'
lineup, and Reggie Miller capitalized by scoring seven points.
Jalen Rose had eight points on 4-of-5 shooting, most during a 15-4
run midway through the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles won the first two games of the series at Staples
Center. Sunday's game was the first home Finals game ever played by
the Pacers, who won three championships in the ABA.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers lacked patience on offense, settling for jumpers
instead of working the ball into Shaquille O'Neal. The league MVP,
who averaged 41.5 points and 21.5 rebounds in the first two games
of the Finals, got just one shot in the game's first 11 minutes and
had five points at quarter's end.
</P>
<P>
   Heeding coach Larry Bird's directive, Indiana got the ball
inside to center Rik Smits in an effort to draw fouls on O'Neal.
But Smits took mostly outside shots and went 3-for-9 from the
field, keeping Indiana's lead small.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Jackson scored the game's first basket and made the sign of
the cross, which he began doing during the Eastern Conference
finals against New York. The Conseco Fieldhouse crowd loved it, and
they also booed O'Neal at every opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Davis had six rebounds in the first quarter for the Pacers.
Los Angeles made seven turnovers in the period.
</P>
<P>
   The players were much more feisty than in the first two games,
with Davis and the Lakers' Robert Horry exchanging stares and
shoves after Horry threw the ball hard at Davis while falling out
of bounds. Dual technicals were called on Jackson and Ron Harper
when the two shoved the ball at each other with 2:34 to play.

<HEADLINE> Quinn Wins Lemieux Invitational  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEIDELBERG, Pa. (AP) -- Dan Quinn birdied three of the final six
holes for a final-round 69, winning the Mario Lemieux Celebrity
Invitational golf tournament Sunday with a 14-under-par 202 total,
best-ever on the Celebrity Players Tour.
</P>
<P>
   The 14-year NHL veteran, who played with Lemieux in Pittsburgh,
entered the final round with a double-digit lead, but almost took
himself out of action when he walked into the nearby scoreboard on
the seventh hole.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mario pushed me -- he tried to win,'' Quinn said with a grin.
''He just pushed me right into the scoreboard. I was being a
showoff and saying ''Hi'' to the kids, and wasn't paying
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I hit hard,'' Quinn said. ''Somebody said that was harder than
I ever got hit in hockey, and I didn't like that.''
</P>
<P>
   After parring that hole and shooting a 35 on the front nine,
Quinn added a 34 on the back to win by 14 strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn, who finished third last year, donated half of the $40,000
first prize to the Lemieux Foundation for cancer research.
</P>
<P>
   ''I played really well,'' Quinn said. ''I just had one bogey on
12, and I think I hit every green except 12. Mario said I didn't
play this well the past few years, but I haven't played this well
in 35 years.''
</P>
<P>
   ''(Quinn) hit so many good shots the last two days that I played
with him and only two bad drives, so he played some unbelievable
golf,'' Lemieux said.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee Titans placekicker Al Del Greco (69) and former major
league left-hander Shane Rawley (70) tied for second at even-par
216, earning $21,000 each. Del Greco eagled No. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Former tennis star Ivan Lendl, second going into the final
round, finished fourth (76--219), while former NFL quarterback Mark
Rypien moved up to fifth (73--220). Former St. Louis Cardinals
outfielder Andy Van Slyke (75) and San Francisco 49ers quarterback
John Brodie (76) were tied for sixth at 222.
</P>
<P>
   Lemieux (81) tied for 10th with another former Penguins player,
Pierre Larouche (72), at 225.
</P>
<P>
   Two-time defending Lemieux Invitational champion Rick Rhoden
(79) was 12th overall with a 10-over 226. Last year's runner-up,
former Denver Broncos quarterback John Elway, tied for 23rd
(78--233).

Reds-Indians:
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI: Despite hitting a tying, three-run homer in Sunday's
7-5 win over Cleveland, Ken Griffey Jr. was reluctant to talk to
reporters after the game. ''You can't win,'' said Griffey, who
declined to do any TV interviews. ''It didn't matter how I felt at
the beginning of the year or when I started the year 0-for-10, you
guys are on me.'' ... On Aaron Boone's go-ahead single in the 13th,
Cincinnati's Dmitri Young collided with umpire Paul Schrieber while
running to second. Reds manager Jack McKeon ran onto the field to
protest that Young was interfered with. ''He blocked my runner,''
McKeon said. ''I told him to go try out for the Redskins.''
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND: An MRI taken on 2B Roberto Alomar's sore left wrist
before the game was negative. He injured his wrist while making a
check swing in Chicago a few weeks ago and has been playing in pain
ever since. ''The doctor told me that if I keep playing it's not
going to get any better,'' said Alomar. ''I don't want to take a
shot right now, but unless I stop playing it won't go away.'' The
Indians already have eight players on the DL. ... The Indians open
a three-game series Monday with first-place Chicago and will play
the White Sox seven times in 11 days. This is the first time
Cleveland has been out of first in the AL Central this late in the
season since 1994. ''The White Sox are good,'' Indians manager
Charlie Manuel said. ''They've got spirit and their pitching is a
lot better than people realize.'' ... LHP Ricardo Rincon, who had
arthroscopic elbow surgery on Thursday, said he could be back in
six weeks.
Cardinals-Tigers:
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS: Mark McGwire hit his first home run at Comerica Park
and now has connected in a record 37 major league ballparks, moving
one ahead of Fred McGriff. McGwire has now homered in all three new
parks that opened this season. ... Ray Lankford, who had been out
of the Cardinals lineup since June 3 with a sore left hamstring,
sprained his right hand while striking out in the second and was
replaced as designated hitter by Eric Davis in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT: Dave Mlicki's ERA rose from 5.40 to 6.22. ... The
Tigers, who started the season 5-17, are 18-18 in their last 36
games. ... Detroit is 4-11 lifetime against Pat Hentgen.
Expos-Blue Jays:
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL: Jose Vidro raised his average to .374 by going
3-for-5. It was his 26th multi-hit game of the year. ... The Expos
have lost four of five games. ... Dustin Hermanson pitched six
innings. It was his longest outing since going seven innings on
April 26th.
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO: David Wells limited the opposition to three runs or
less for the fourth consecutive outing. ... Blue Jays pitchers
recorded a season-high 15 strikeouts.
Red Sox-Braves:
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON: Jose Offerman made his first start of the season at
first base. ''I don't know if I feel comfortable over there,'' he
said. ''I'm just trying to do my job.'' ... Offerman went 1-for-2
with three walks. He has reached base in 14 straight games and has
hit safely in eight straight road games. ... P Ramon Martinez
averaged 4 2-3 innings in his first 11 starts before going 6 1-3
innings Sunday -- his second-longest appearance of the season. ...
2B Jeff Frye fielded five straight grounders beginning with
Atlanta's final out in the third. He was responsible for all three
outs in the fourth and scooped up Chipper Jones' grounder leading
off the fifth. The streak finally ended when Wally Joyner flied
out.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: OF Bobby Bonilla was supposed to be in the lineup, but
he remained home with a 102-degree fever. Brian Jordan, who hoped
to rest a sore right knee, started in right field instead. ''I had
it all figured out,'' Jordan quipped. ''I was going to play cards
with Cat (Andres Galarraga, who didn't start).'' ... SS Walt Weiss
will be sidelined for a few days with a sprained right thumb. He
was injured while sliding into third base on a triple in Saturday
night's game. The swelling went down overnight and there are no
plans to put Weiss on the 15-day disabled list. ... P Terry
Mulholland, who strained his right hamstring Saturday, was still
moving tentatively a day later. It will be a couple of days before
the left-hander knows if he'll be able to make his next scheduled
start, at Pittsburgh on Thursday night.
Marlins-Devil Rays:
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: OF Cliff Floyd was scheduled to return to Fort
Lauderdale and undergo an MRI after spraining his left knee sliding
into second base in the ninth inning. ''It's sore right now,'' said
Floyd after the game. ''I think at the most, it's sprained.'' ...
Floyd went 3-for-5 and has reached base in 38 straight games. He
also has a season-high seven-game hitting streak. ... RHP A.J.
Burnett (right thumb) could begin throwing off a bullpen mound this
week.
</P>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY: RHP Juan Guzman (right shoulder tendinitis) reported
no problems after a 15-minute bullpen session. Barring any
setbacks, he will rejoin the Devil Rays after a minor league start
Wednesday for Triple-A Durham. ''He's one start away from being
back here,'' manager Larry Rothschild said. ''He threw on the side
today and did very well.''... DH Jose Canseco (strained left heel)
took batting practice and will resume running on Tuesday.
Phillies-Orioles:
</P>
<P>
   BALTIMORE: Albert Belle doubled in the fifth inning Sunday to
extend his hitting streak to 13 games, and his assist in the top of
the fifth was his fourth of the year. He tied for the AL lead with
17 outfield assists last year. ... Brady Anderson got three hits
and passed Ken Singleton for fifth place on the Orioles career hit
list. Anderson, 5-for-12 (.417) in the series, now has 1,458 hits
with the club. ... Jeff Conine's homer was his first in 24 career
at-bats against Andy Ashby.
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: Phillies pitchers surrendered eight homers in the
three-game series against Baltimore. ... Andy Ashby has allowed
three homers three times this season and has lost six of his last
seven decisions. ... Bobby Abreu went 0-for-4, breaking his team
high 11-game hit streak. ... Rob Ducey's second-inning homer
against Mike Mussina was his second in 10 at-bats against the
right-hander. He's 3-for-11 lifetime against Mussina.
Pirates-Royals:
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY: On Saturday, the Royals and Pirates combined for 23
singles. That total marked the most hits in a major league game
without an extra-base hit since the Phillies and Cardinals combined
for 24 singles on June 26, 1988. ... Kansas City is 7-2 in
extra-inning games.
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: 2B Warren Morris' fielding error at second base in
the seventh inning was the first for Pittsburgh in 68 innings.
Brewers-Twins:
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: True to form, Marquis Grissom is heating up at the
plate just as the weather turns warmer. ''I can't get off to a good
start the first two months to save my life, and it's been like that
ever since I started playing,'' said Grissom, who hit one homer
through Friday and then homered Saturday and Sunday at the
Metrodome. ... The Brewers' three-game series at Minneapolis came
in between two six-game homestands. ''It's nice to take a road trip
like this,'' manager Davey Lopes said. ''It's basically around the
corner and now we go back home again.''
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: Ace Brad Radke hasn't gotten any run support all
season, and now he can't even seem to help himself out. ''Broken
record, every five days, not much different from five days ago,''
Radke (3-8) said after allowing five runs on 10 hits in six-plus
innings of the Twins' 5-3 loss to Milwaukee on Sunday. What's
bothering him? The lack of run support? Location that's a bit off?
''Everything in general, all of the above,'' Radke said. ... New
Twins CEO Chris Clouser says that he and Radke's agent, Ron Simon,
had agreed to meet soon. Clouser hopes they can reopen contract
talks. The sides haven't talked contract since February, when the
club balked at the right-hander's request to have a one-year,
opt-out clause in any new deal. Radke, who can become a free agent
after this year, would be prime trade bait if the sides can't agree
on an extension.
Cubs-White Sox:
</P>
<P>
   CUBS: 1B Mark Grace didn't start Sunday. He fouled a ball off
his right ankle in Saturday's game and also had a tight hamstring.
He was inserted in the ninth inning as a defensive replacement. ''I
knew Grace couldn't beat out a double play,'' manager Don Baylor
said. ''That's why he was on the bench.'' ... Sammy Sosa finished
the series 2-for-13 with nine strikeouts. But his two hits were big
ones. He tied the game Friday night with a two-run homer and tied
it again Sunday with a two-run double. ''I only got two hits in the
series, but those two hits count,'' he said. ''They came at the
right time.'' ... The Yankees are rumored to be one of the teams
interested if the Cubs decide to trade Sosa, and chief scout Gene
Michael was at Saturday's and Sunday's games. ... Brant Brown, who
joined the team Saturday after being reacquired in a three-team
trade, went 3-for-5 with a homer and two RBIs on Sunday. ''It's
just like an exhilarating moment,'' he said. ''Just to come back
where you never wanted to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   WHITE SOX: SS Jose Valentin hit his 100th career homer in the
first inning on a solo shot to right. He made it a two-homer day
with another in the sixth, but neither really mattered to him.
''It's not how many home runs you hit,'' he said. ''It's how many
runs you score.''
Rangers-Rockies:
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS: Ivan Rodriguez had his second four-hit game of the season
and 20th of his career. ... Despite failing to get a decision,
Darren Oliver remains 3-0 in six career starts against Colorado.
... Gabe Kapler and Chad Curtis each made lunging catches to rob
the Rockies in the third and fourth innings. ... Royce Clayton's
solo homer in the seventh was a 444-foot shot to left.
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO: Mike Lansing did not start for the second straight
game because of a sore lower back, but he entered Sunday's game in
the seventh. ... Tom Goodwin committed his first error of the
season and first since May 22, 1999, when he was with Texas -- a
span of 123 games. ... Colorado has won six consecutive series at
home.
Mariners-Giants:
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE: Edgar Martinez has made eight starts in National League
stadiums during interleague play, all at first base, and has hit
safely in all of them, going 10-for-29 (.345) with four homers and
five RBIs. He has not committed an error in 69 total chances in
those starts. ... Mark McLemore expects to hear from the
commissioner's office this week over his appeal of a five-game
suspension for having charged the mound against Tampa Bay's Esteban
Yan three weeks ago. ... The Mariners have the lowest home ERA in
the AL at 3.22. ... Seattle enters play Sunday having lost nine of
10 interleague series played in NL parks.
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO: Lori Gardner, the wife of San Francisco Giants
pitcher Mark Gardner, has undergone her second liver transplant.
She had the 20-hour operation at a Bay Area hospital on Friday. The
former Fresno State softball player originally had a liver
transplant in February 1998, but needed a second operation after
complications from radiation during her first transplant. ... The
Giants have 12 blown saves, putting them on pace for 35. The record
is 31, set by the 1998 Cardinals.
Athletics-Dodgers:
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND: Despite the Athletics' 33-25 record against NL teams
during the three-plus seasons of interleague play, 2B Randy Velarde
admitted he wouldn't be upset if interleague play was scrapped
after four seasons. ''I think it might be time to go back to a
regular schedule,'' Velarde said. ''I can't emphasize enough how it
taints a possible matchup in the World Series. It takes a little
bit away from that when the Yankees are playing the Braves, or
we're playing the Giants.''
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: The Dodgers are bracing for Monday night's visit by
the NL West-leading Arizona Diamondbacks, who swept them in a
three-game series last month. ... One of the most frustrated
players in the Dodgers' injury-riddled clubhouse is reliever Gregg
Olson, whose season has been a complete bust so far because of a
strained left forearm that has sidelined him since his previous
outing on April 8. ''Things have improved over the past week, so
they're moving forward,'' said the right-hander, who had more than
60 appearances in each of the previous two seasons with Arizona.
Angels-Diamondbacks:
</P>
<P>
   ANAHEIM: 3B Troy Glaus grabbed his right knee and fell to the
ground in pain when he was picked off at first by Armando Reynoso
in the second inning of Saturday's game. After lying for several
minutes surrounded by teammates, he walked off the soreness and
stayed in the game. ... The Angels have hit home runs in 49 of 62
games this season. ... Darin Erstad, the AL batting leader, had a
single and double in his first two at-bats Sunday to give him 102
hits.
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA: Matt Williams, who came out of Saturday's game after
two innings because of recurring plantar fasciatis in his left
foot, had a cortisone shot after the game and was back in the
lineup Sunday. ... Todd Stottlemyre, on the 15-day DL with
tendinitis in his right elbow, is scheduled to start against Kevin
Brown in Los Angeles on Thursday. ... The Diamondbacks leave Monday
for seven road games against the two teams chasing them in the NL
West, four in Los Angeles and three at Colorado.
Mets-Yankees:
</P>
<P>
   METS: GM Steve Phillips said he had no interest signing former
Mets RHP Dwight Gooden, who agreed to a minor league deal with the
Yankees. ''He didn't seem to be a fit for us,'' Phillips said. ...
Manager Bobby Valentine said he hasn't thought much about the
rumors his team is interested in trading for Cubs slugger Sammy
Sosa. ''It's not intriguing for me until someone tells me we have a
chance to get him and this is what we have to give up.'' ...
Sunday's starter Mike Hampton got his first career win against the
Yankees in relief for Seattle on April, 23, 1993. This was his
first start against the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   YANKEES: The Yankees signed RHP Dwight Gooden, who pitched for
them in 1996-97, to a minor league deal. ''We still feel like he
has something left in his arm,'' Yankees pitching coach Mel
Stottlemyre said. ... 2B Chuck Knoblauch, who has not played since
last Sunday because of a sore left forearm, took BP but was not in
the starting lineup. ... Next up for the Yankees is a three-game
series with AL East rival Boston, which will bring a different kind
of excitement to Yankee Stadium. ''This is a wonderful show for the
fans,'' manager Joe Torre said of the Subway Series. ''But there's
more into it when we play the Red Sox because we both have the same
goal of winning the Eastern Division.'' ... RHP Ramiro Mendoza
threw off a mound and is on target to make his next start Tuesday
against Boston. ... Jorge Posada batted cleanup for the first time
in his career.
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Astros-Padres:
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: When Tim Bogar pitched a perfect eighth inning in
Saturday night's 13-3 loss to San Diego, it was the first time the
Astros have had a position player enter the game to pitch since
June 22, 1995, when John Cangelosi came in to close out a 13-2 loss
the Chicago Cubs. Cangelosi pitched a scoreless ninth in that game,
allowing no hits and one walk. ... Bogar said that when he was in
the bullpen warming up, reliever Chris Holt taught him how to throw
a sinker.
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO: With RH reliever Carlos Reyes making his 2000 debut
on Saturday night, the Padres have had 38 players -- and 20 pitchers
-- appear in at least one game this season. The club record is 48,
set in 1991. ... Tony Gwynn was back in the lineup as part of his
one game on, one game off routine to rest his degenerative left
knee.

<HEADLINE> Bryant Sits Out Game 3  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NADEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Los Angeles Lakers standout Kobe Bryant sat
out Game 3 of the NBA Finals on Sunday night after spraining his
left ankle two nights earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The decision wasn't made until shortly before the opening tipoff
at Conseco Fieldhouse. The Lakers entered the game with a 2-0 lead
over the Indiana Pacers in the best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Shaw, one of the Lakers' heroes in Game 7 of the Western
Conference finals on June 4, took Bryant's spot in the starting
lineup. He shot 3-for-18 in the first two games of the series, but
made two baskets early in Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 90 minutes before the game began, while lying on a
training table in the Lakers' dressing room with his ankle being
stimulated electrically, Bryant indicated with a hand signal he was
uncertain as to his status.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, his ankle, which appeared slightly
discolored, was unwrapped and then packed in ice, and Bryant spoke
with team physician Dr. Steve Lombardo.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the media an hour and 45 minutes before game-time,
Lakers coach Phil Jackson said the decision to play or not was
basically up to Bryant, ''although the doctors are influencing him,
obviously.''
</P>
<P>
   ''But there's no structural damage to the ankle, per se,''
Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said at that stage he believed it was about 75-25 that
Bryant would sit out.
</P>
<P>
   ''But he's going to try it out and put some things around it to
ice it first, electric stim, and go out and see how it works,''
Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant has two more full days off before Game 4, to be played
Wednesday night, but as Jackson acknowledged, ''Realistically
speaking, Kobe won't be 100 percent for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson also said he hadn't given Bryant advice as to whether he
should try to give it a go or not.
</P>
<P>
   As far as playing without Bryant, Jackson said the Lakes were:
''Oh, very positive. We're very positive. We know this is a game in
which we've rode a little bit of momentum coming in from Sunday's
game against Portland through this week, and, you know, we know
that this is going to be a very difficult crowd to play in front
of. ... But we think that we have -- still have a real good shot at
winning without Kobe.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, a second-team All-NBA selection as well as first-team
all-defense pick, was injured while making his only shot of Game 2
on Friday night, a 17-foot jumper with 3:26 left in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   He landed on Jalen Rose' foot after releasing the shot, and went
down. Twenty-one seconds later, during the first available break,
Bryant was helped off the court.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers went on to win the game at Staples Center 111-104.
Bryant scored 14 points -- well below his playoff average of 21.2 --
in his team's 104-87 victory over the Pacers in Game 1.

<HEADLINE> At least 12 patients at psychiatric hospital became pregnant since 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - Despite a policy prohibiting patients at
Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital from having sex, at least 12
mentally impaired patients have become pregnant while being treated
at the Parsippany facility since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   At least nine of those gave birth.
</P>
<P>
   Greystone and state officials admit patients do engage in sexual
relations with each other and even staff members due to lax
supervision. But they say there's little they can do to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not sure there is anything you can do to stop sex from
occurring in those situations,'' Jerucham Goldberg, a neurologist
who is president-elect of Greystone's medical staff, told The
Star-Ledger of Newark for Sunday's editions. ''Sex has been going
on at this hospital for a long time; it's nothing new. It's not an
easy issue, and there's no easy answer.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's no excuse for families, a Greystone patient advocate
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The responsibility of sex, the emotions involved with sex, are
not for people who are supposed to be under care at the hospital,
said Dorothy Hurley Thaller, chairwoman of Concerned Families of
Greystone. ''How can this be beneficial to women who are patients
at the hospital?
</P>
<P>
   ''The families do not want their sons or daughters involved in
sexual relations at Greystone,'' she said. ''When they recover,
they can get on with their lives and relationships, or whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the pregnancies were not discovered until the
women were in their second trimester, when abortion was no longer
an option, and their babies had missed out on vital prenatal care.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Kaufman, director of the state Division of Mental Health,
said New Jersey does not keep records on the number of instances of
sexual activities at state-run facilities. But he said he receives
more such complaints about Greystone than anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   The state intends to close the troubled hospital, and transfer
its patients to other institutions or community settings.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey has a no-sex policy for all its psychiatric
hospitals. But the newspaper interviewed several patients who said
sex is commonplace at Greystone, especially among patients who have
''grounds privileges'' enabling them to walk around the 600-acre
campus in late afternoon or early evening when supervision is at
its lightest.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anything goes then,'' one unnamed patient said. ''Patients
don't pay attention (to the no-sex rule); they just follow their
hormones.''

<HEADLINE> Rival Jewish Groups Trade Barbs  </HEADLINE>
By NICK WADHAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- An angry dispute has broken out between two rival
Jewish groups, with one alleging that the Kremlin is meddling in
the community's politics -- a rollback to the Soviet era, when the
Communist leadership kept religious groups on a short leash.
</P>
<P>
   The rift between followers of Russia's chief rabbi, Adolf
Shayevich, and a group led by the ultra-Orthodox Chabad Lubavitch
movement became public last month after Shayevich wrote President
Vladimir Putin a letter about it.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, Shayevich claimed the Kremlin had snubbed him by
initially not inviting him to Putin's inauguration or the
anniversary celebration of the end of World War II. He said
representatives of the Lubavitch movement -- a group he said
represents less than 5 percent of Russian Jews -- had been invited
from the start.
</P>
<P>
   Shayevich was referring to the Federation of Jewish Communities,
a group formed in November under the leadership of the Lubavitch
movement. The Lubavitchers, led in Russia by Rabbi Berl Lazar, have
actively sought to bring the nation's traditionally unobservant
Jews into the religious fold by founding synagogues, schools and
community centers, and distributing food and religious articles.
</P>
<P>
   The 62-year-old Shayevich also wrote that ''official sources''
had told him that the Federation of Jewish Communities was trying
to replace him with its own rabbi and push him to resign -- and that
the federation's plan had the Kremlin's blessing.
</P>
<P>
   Both Kremlin officials and leaders of the federation have denied
Shayevich's claim.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have such plans,'' Lazar said this week. ''Where he
got that information, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   But Shayevich's accusations have raised fears that Putin's
administration was choosing favorites in the religious community, a
return to the Soviet era, when unofficial anti-Semitism was
rampant.
</P>
<P>
   Federation and Kremlin leaders also suggest that the Jewish
community is caught in the middle of a political conflict between
Russian Jewish tycoon Vladimir Gusinsky, head of the Russian Jewish
Congress -- the secular partner of Shayevich's Congress of Jewish
Religious Communities and Organizations -- and the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   Gusinsky's holding company, Media-MOST, was raided by government
tax police last month. He called the raid an attempt to threaten
his various media holdings, which have been critical of Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Shayevich supporters say that the campaign against Gusinsky had
extended to the Jewish organization he heads.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are circles around the president putting pressure on the
Jewish community in Russia,'' said Pavel Feldblum, executive vice
president of the Moscow Jewish Community.
</P>
<P>
   Shayevich has been chief rabbi of Russia since the early 1980s,
during the Soviet era, when one unified organization represented
Russian Jewry. Now the Jewish community has fractured into several
branches, and Lazar's movement has emerged as a strong rival for
members, funding and influence.
</P>
<P>
   Lazar said he saw no evidence that the government was trying to
gain greater control over the country's Jewish community. But he
and other Federation leaders said they enjoyed very good relations
with the government.
</P>
<P>
   Lazar praised Putin's government, saying that anti-Semitism in
Russia was on the decline. In recent years, synagogues have been
bombed, Jewish cemeteries vandalized and a Jewish leader stabbed,
but he said Jews today felt much freer in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Shayevich, who was traveling abroad, could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Mikhail Gluz, the president of the Federation, said Shayevich's
letter could lead to a split in the Jewish community in Russia. He
called for a meeting of top rabbis to settle the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to gather all rabbis and talk and look at each other
and ask who is who, who's doing what, and ask if there is meddling
by the government and if there is, that's unacceptable,'' Gluz
said.

<HEADLINE> 'Lorenzo's Oil' Mother Odone Dies  </HEADLINE>
By MATTHEW BARAKAT
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Michaela Odone, whose efforts to develop a
treatment for her son's rare disease inspired the movie ''Lorenzo's
Oil,'' has died at the age of 61.
</P>
<P>
   Odone died of lung cancer Saturday at her home in Fairfax.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband, Augusto, had no medical training but helped
develop a combination of olive and rapeseed oils that they used to
treat their son Lorenzo's rare degenerative brain disease,
adrenoleukodystrophy, or ALD.
</P>
<P>
   The oil stopped the progression of Lorenzo's disease and allowed
the boy, once in a vegetative state, to communicate slightly with
hand signals.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers were initially skeptical but clinical studies showed
that the treatment worked about half the time if administered in
the disease's early stages.
</P>
<P>
   ''The definitive truth will only come in 10 to 15 years,''
Augusto Odone said in a telephone interview Sunday. ''It's still
under scrutiny. The verdict is still out.''
</P>
<P>
   After 13 years of treatment, Lorenzo, now 22, is ''holding his
own,'' Odone said. ''He doesn't have any bedsores because of the
care Michaela provided. He looks healthy, but he hasn't recovered
any functions in a big way.''
</P>
<P>
   Augusto Odone said the constant care his New York-born wife
provided to Lorenzo took a toll on her health.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was her sacrifice for Lorenzo. She was with him 16 hours a
day, continuously,'' he said. ''She did not go out. We did not
entertain people. We did not travel. We did not take vacations. It
wore her out.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1992 movie, Michaela and Augusto Odone were played by
Susan Sarandon and Nick Nolte.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Augusto and Lorenzo, Michaela Odone is survived
by two stepdaughters, two sisters and a brother.

Study: Most Death Row Cases Flawed
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A study of 4,578 death penalty appeals from 1973 through
1995 show that two-thirds of the appeals were successful, increasing the debate
over capital punishment. Most cases ''are so seriously flawed that they have to
be done over again,'' said Columbia University law professor James Liebman, the
lead author. Texas Gov. George W. Bush recently approved his first 30-day
reprieve in a death penalty case -- to allow time for DNA testing -- after
permitting 131 executions. Public support for capital punishment remains high.

Web Attracts Younger News Audience
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Key segments of the nation's news audience, particularly
younger and better-educated Americans, and those seeking financial information,
are turning increasingly to the Internet, says a new poll on media trends. The
Web's rapid growth as a source for news continues a splintering of that audience
among the Internet, cable and broadcast television, and print publications. A
third of the public now goes online for news at least once a week, compared to a
fifth two years ago, according to a Pew Research poll. Fifteen percent get daily
reports from the Internet, almost three times the number two years ago.

Zimbabwe Criticizes U.N. Monitoring

<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Zimbabwe's president accused the United Nations of
trying to hijack international monitoring of his country's parliamentary
elections, which many doubted could be free and fair amid rampant political
violence, a newspaper reported Sunday. The United Nations overstepped its
welcome in trying to coordinate election monitoring, President Robert Mugabe
complained to a state newspaper, a week after U.N. observers pulled out of the
country's election monitoring operations.

Vice President Gore Hits N.Y. Media

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After a media-heavy kickoff in New York City, Vice
President Al Gore's ''progress and prosperity tour'' this week will concentrate
on the Pennsylvania and Ohio battlegrounds, aides said. Together, those states
offer 44 of the 270 electoral votes Gore will need to defeat Republican
presidential rival George W. Bush in November. The most recent statewide polls
suggested what amounts to a dead heat in both states, with Bush just a whisper
ahead in Ohio.

Assad's Son Moves Closer to Syria Presidency

   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -- Bashar Assad, son of the late Syrian leader, was
unanimously nominated as the only presidential candidate Sunday, another
indication he will succeed his father. The ruling Baath Party also appointed
Bashar commander of the armed forces. President Hafez Assad, who died Saturday,
was the previous commander. In anointing Bashar Assad, the hierarchy is opting
for a smooth, stable transition. All that is left is for the rubber-stamp
parliament, which is scheduled to meet June 25, to approve the nomination and
for elections to be held.

Ski Resorts Eye Insurance Policies
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Final Colorado ski season figures, to be released tomorrow,
will show the second straight major decline in the numbers of skiers and
snowboarders who hit the slopes in Colorado, the nation's No. 1 ski state,
officials said. Resorts in many other states also fared poorly. Now Aspen and
other resorts are thinking of joining Vail, Crested Butte and Telluride in
buying an insurance policy to soften the blow of no-show skiiers in no-snow
years. This year the group, based in Steamboat Springs, will pay out more than
$20 million to resorts from California to New England.

<HEADLINE> Jewish group denies alleged Kremlin plot to oust Russia's top rabbi </HEADLINE>
By NICK WADHAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) - An angry dispute has broken out between two rival
Jewish groups, with one alleging that the Kremlin is meddling in
the community's politics - a rollback to the Soviet era, when the
Communist leadership kept religious groups on a short leash.
</P>
<P>
   The rift between followers of Russia's chief rabbi, Adolf
Shayevich, and a group led by the ultra-Orthodox Chabad Lubavitch
movement became public last month after Shayevich wrote President
Vladimir Putin a letter about it.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, Shayevich claimed the Kremlin had snubbed him by
initially not inviting him to Putin's inauguration or the
anniversary celebration of the end of World War II. He said
representatives of the Lubavitch movement - a group he said
represents less than 5 percent of Russian Jews - had been invited
from the start.
</P>
<P>
   Shayevich was referring to the Federation of Jewish Communities,
a group formed in November under the leadership of the Lubavitch
movement. The Lubavitchers, led in Russia by Rabbi Berl Lazar, have
actively sought to bring the nation's traditionally unobservant
Jews into the religious fold by founding synagogues, schools and
community centers, and distributing food and religious articles.
</P>
<P>
   The 62-year-old Shayevich also wrote that ''official sources''
had told him that the Federation of Jewish Communities was trying
to replace him with its own rabbi and push him to resign - and that
the federation's plan had the Kremlin's blessing.
</P>
<P>
   Both Kremlin officials and leaders of the federation have denied
Shayevich's claim.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have such plans,'' Lazar said this week. ''Where he
got that information, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   But Shayevich's accusations have raised fears that Putin's
administration was choosing favorites in the religious community, a
return to the Soviet era, when unofficial anti-Semitism was
rampant.
</P>
<P>
   Federation and Kremlin leaders also suggest that the Jewish
community is caught in the middle of a political conflict between
Russian Jewish tycoon Vladimir Gusinsky, head of the Russian Jewish
Congress - the secular partner of Shayevich's Congress of Jewish
Religious Communities and Organizations - and the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   Gusinsky's holding company, Media-MOST, was raided by government
tax police last month. He called the raid an attempt to threaten
his various media holdings, which have been critical of Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Shayevich supporters say that the campaign against Gusinsky had
extended to the Jewish organization he heads.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are circles around the president putting pressure on the
Jewish community in Russia,'' said Pavel Feldblum, executive vice
president of the Moscow Jewish Community.
</P>
<P>
   Shayevich has been chief rabbi of Russia since the early 1980s,
during the Soviet era, when one unified organization represented
Russian Jewry. Now the Jewish community has fractured into several
branches, and Lazar's movement has emerged as a strong rival for
members, funding and influence.
</P>
<P>
   Lazar said he saw no evidence that the government was trying to
gain greater control over the country's Jewish community. But he
and other Federation leaders said they enjoyed very good relations
with the government.
</P>
<P>
   Lazar praised Putin's government, saying that anti-Semitism in
Russia was on the decline. In recent years, synagogues have been
bombed, Jewish cemeteries vandalized and a Jewish leader stabbed,
but he said Jews today felt much freer in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Shayevich, who was traveling abroad, could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Mikhail Gluz, the president of the Federation, said Shayevich's
letter could lead to a split in the Jewish community in Russia. He
called for a meeting of top rabbis to settle the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to gather all rabbis and talk and look at each other
and ask who is who, who's doing what, and ask if there is meddling
by the government and if there is, that's unacceptable,'' Gluz
said.

B.C. Gov't Funds Stripper Study
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- The University of British
Columbia wants former strippers to bare it all -- for research.
</P>
<P>
   A three-year study, funded by the federal government, will look
into the history of erotic entertainment in Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   From pasties to lap dances, Prof. Becki Ross is looking for
stories from the front lines of what she calls this ''little
understood, much maligned'' business.
</P>
<P>
   ''I see it as an art form,'' said Ross, who teaches sociology at
UBC. ''I actually am in awe of the women on the stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver once claimed one of the hottest night spots north of
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Erotic pioneers like Josephine Baker, Lili St. Cyr and Gypsy
Rose Lee took the stage to take it all off in Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Ross will receive about $50,000 from the federal Social Sciences
and Humanities Research Council of Canada over the next three years
for her research.

B.C. Tobacco Ban Public Hearings To Open
</P>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- When the provincial Workers'
Compensation Board imposed tough anti-smoking regulations across
the province in January, it ignited a fiery protest from smokers
and the businesses that serve them.
</P>
<P>
   All are gearing up for another showdown at public hearings that
begin Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We expect to be railroaded with a policy that they've already
drafted,'' said Dave Crown, vice president of the Liquor Licensees
and Retailers Association of British Columbia
</P>
<P>
   The short-lived British Columbia regulations were among the
toughest in North America, banning smoking in bars, restaurants,
casinos, long-term care facilities and even provincial jails.
</P>
<P>
   But after the regulations were in place for only three months, a
British Columbia Supreme Court judge struck the policy down in
March, saying the ban was enacted without proper consultation.

<HEADLINE> Haitians Vote in Grand'-Anse  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL NORTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- Haitians voted Sunday in local and
legislative elections in the southern Grand'-Anse District, where
voting was postponed on May 21 because of technical problems and
political disputes.
</P>
<P>
   There was no violence during the vote, election office president
Benoit Guerrier said, despite long lines caused when some stations
opened late. Results were expected later this week, with a run-off
round scheduled for June 25.
</P>
<P>
   Voter turnout appeared to be good, an indication that residents
were ignoring opposition parties who had called for a boycott.
Those parties have complained that the May 21 vote was tainted to
favor the Lavalas Family Party of former President Jean-Bertrand
Aristide.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the protests, opposition candidates' names remained on
the ballots and their representatives helped monitor voting at
polls. Some said they were ignoring the boycott.
</P>
<P>
   About 210,000 of the district's 345,000 adults were registered
to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Two upper-house and 11 lower-house seats were up for election.
Eighteen mayoral commissions and hundreds of urban and rural
councils were also on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Aristide's party swept the election in Haiti's other eight
districts during the May 21 vote, and it was expected to do well in
Grand'-Anse as well.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, unidentified arsonists set fire to election
offices in two coastal towns, Mirogoane and Petit Trou de Nippes,
but the fires did not prevent voting there.

<HEADLINE> Astros Players Involved in Fight  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- In a season already gone bad, Houston Astros
rookie catcher Mitch Meluskey punched teammate Matt Mieske during
batting practice on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Mieske was cut over his left eye. The fight happened about an
hour before the Astros' latest defeat, a 4-1 loss to the San Diego
Padres, with several hundred fans already in the stands. Some
Astros veterans clearly were unhappy about the fight.
</P>
<P>
   According to witnesses, Meluskey was late for his turn in the
batting cage and he jumped in ahead of Mieske. The two exchanged
words and Meluskey hit Mieske when the two were outside the cage.
Meluskey was hustled away and Mieske was treated on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's something I feel bad about,'' Meluskey said after the
game. ''There's nothing I can do about it. I'm going to sit down
and talk to him about it. It's between teammates.''
</P>
<P>
   Meluskey wouldn't discuss specifics of the fight other than to
say: ''It was not a cheap shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Mieske refused comment, telling reporters: ''I don't think it's
any of your business.''
</P>
<P>
   After winning three straight NL Central titles, the Astros have
collapsed this year. Sunday's loss dropped them to 22-40, the worst
record in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a frustrating season to be sure,'' Meluskey said.
''Because of that, it's even worse. It looks like we're rolling
over and turning against each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Craig Biggio was unhappy about the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ''To me, it has everything to do with respect,'' Biggio said,
noting that Mieske is in his 11th year in pro ball. ''You know,
some people have it and some people don't. I'm going to leave it at
that. There's no way in the world something like that should
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Jose Lima agreed, saying he'd never seen anything like
it in his 11 years in pro baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the time when we have to stick together as a family,''
said Lima, who lost his ninth straight decision. ''I don't
appreciate something like this happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Larry Dierker said the fight probably had to do with
frustration, ''but it doesn't mean it's all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker said he'd talk to general manager Gerry Hunsicker about
the fight, but didn't have any other comment.
</P>
<P>
   Meluskey, who's hitting .300, leads all NL rookies with seven
homers, 33 RBIs, 12 doubles and 19 extra-base hits. Mieske is
hitting .184.

<HEADLINE> Pacers Lead Lakers 79-66 After 3Q  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- A boisterous home crowd and the resurgence
of Reggie Miller helped the Indiana Pacers take a 79-66 lead over
the Los Angeles Lakers through three quarters of Game 3 of the NBA
Finals on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant's sprained left ankle kept him out of the Lakers'
lineup, and Miller capitalized by scoring 25 points in a barrage of
outside shots and drives.
</P>
<P>
   Amid deafening chants of ''REG-GIE! REG-GIE!'', Miller hit a
long jumper and a 3-pointer late in the third quarter to give the
Pacers an 18-point lead. The star guard played every minute of the
first three quarters as Indiana moved within 12 minutes of cutting
Los Angeles' series lead to 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles won the first two games of the best-of-seven series
at Staples Center. Sunday's contest was the first home Finals game
ever played by the Pacers, who won three championships in the ABA.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal started slowly again but had 26 points and
seven rebounds through three quarters. The Lakers too often settled
for jump shots and failed to pound the ball inside to O'Neal, who
was 12-for-20 from the field through three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   The league MVP, who averaged 41.5 points and 21.5 rebounds in
the first two games of the Finals, got just one shot in the game's
first 11 minutes and wasn't getting the prime low-post position he
claimed in the first two games.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, no one stepped up to fill the Lakers' offensive
void created by Bryant's absence. Robert Horry had eight points off
the bench through three quarters, while starting guards Brian Shaw
and Ron Harper had six points apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Miller was 1-for-16 from the field in Game 1 and scored two
points in the fourth quarter of Game 2, but he had 16 points at
halftime Sunday as Indiana led 53-42. Miller and Jalen Rose made
consecutive fast-break layups in the final 24 seconds of the first
half, but Glen Rice hit a 3-pointer with 0.7 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers couldn't score and committed five fouls in the first
three minutes after halftime, and Los Angeles quickly cut Indiana's
lead to 57-52.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana then made a 12-0 run capped by a 3-pointer from Sam
Perkins. Rose had 19 points on 9-of-15 shooting through three
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers, one of the league's worst rebounding teams during
the regular season, outrebounded Los Angeles 29-20 through three
quarters. Rik Smits and Dale Davis drew most of the defensive
assignments against O'Neal, but the Pacers also sent double- and
triple-teams much more frequently than in the first two games.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw was no replacement for Bryant, shooting 3-of-8 for six
points in the first half and getting beaten regularly on defense by
Miller. Bryant, presumably receiving treatment on his ankle, was
not even in street clothes on the Lakers' bench.
</P>
<P>
   The players were much more feisty than in the first two games,
with Davis and Horry exchanging stares and shoves after Horry threw
the ball hard at Davis while falling out of bounds in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Dual technicals were later called on Mark Jackson and Harper
when the two shoved the ball at each other. Derek Fisher and Austin
Croshere extended their mutual dislike, with Croshere committing a
flagrant foul by nearly tackling Fisher to prevent a second-quarter
layup and Fisher shoving him away in response.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, the Pacers played a video clip of Gene
Hackman's speech before the final game in the film ''Hoosiers,'' as
well as a message from Indianapolis native David Letterman, who
urged the Pacers to ''make Daddy proud.''
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Davis, traded by the Pacers to Toronto last summer,
watched from a courtside seat and got a standing ovation when shown
on the video board.

<HEADLINE> Rocker Earns Save in Richmond's Win  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- John Rocker recorded his first save since
being sent to the minors, striking out three -- including Randall
Simon -- in the ninth inning Sunday as the Richmond Braves beat
Columbus 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker was greeted by a mixture of boos and cheers when he came
in to pitch, and again when the game ended.
</P>
<P>
   Simon was the first batter Rocker faced, and the reliever struck
him out on three pitches. Simon swung at a high fastball for strike
three.
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier, Simon -- referred to as a ''fat monkey'' by Rocker
in the offseason -- got a chance to visit with his former Atlanta
teammate.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker faced four batters, giving up a single to Tom Wilson. Of
his 20 pitches, 14 were strikes. In his first minor league outing,
Rocker struck out the side in a 10-5 win against Toledo on Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Asked after the game what Rocker needed to do to get back to
Atlanta, Richmond pitching coach Mike Alvarez said, ''He's doing it
right now, being aggressive, pitching ahead of hitters, going
letter-high to finish guys off.
</P>
<P>
   ''His intensity has been great. While this is a minor league
game, he's pitching like it's 1-0 in the bigs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Richmond manager Randy Ingle: ''In the two games he's taken
the ball for us, I'm really proud of the way he's going about his
business. He is pitching like he's saying, 'I don't belong here, I
belong in the big leagues.'''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker was not made available to reporters after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Unroe hit a two-run homer for Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   Richmond starter Chris Seelbach (3-4) limited the Clippers to
two hits in six innings, struck out seven and walked three.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Lilly (2-4) pitched the first 6 1-3 innings for Columbus,
allowing four runs and 10 hits.

<HEADLINE> Former hostage at U.S. Embassy in Iran, dead at 65  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HOMOSASSA, Fla. (AP) - Bert C. Moore, a history teacher whose
career change to the foreign service led him to become one of 52
Americans held hostage at the U.S. Embassy in Iran from 1979 to
1981, has died. He was 65.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, who moved to Homosassa two years ago from Mount Vernon,
Ohio, died of cancer at his home on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Moore received a bachelor's degree in education from Ohio State
University and a master's degree in Public Administration from
Syracuse University. From 1957 to 1960, he taught American history
and world history at Mount Vernon High School.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961, Moore was appointed as a foreign service officer in the
U.S. Department of State.
</P>
<P>
   During his foreign service career, Moore served in Washington
and at U.S. embassies and consulates in Canada, Rhodesia, Malawi,
France, Zaire, Iran, Spain, Nigeria, Indonesia and India.
</P>
<P>
   For being one of the Americans held hostage in Tehran, Iran,
during the Islamic fundamentalist revolution, Moore received the
Christian A. Herter Award in 1981 for extraordinary contributions
to the practice of diplomacy and the Department of State Award for
Valor that same year. In 1985, he received a Presidential
Meritorious Award.
</P>
<P>
   After retiring from the Senior Foreign Service in 1990 as a
minister counselor of the United States, Moore continued to work on
short term assignments for the Department of State.
</P>
<P>
   Moore is survived by his wife, Marjorie; sons David Moore of

Web Attracts Younger News Audience
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new poll on media trends says key segments of the
nation's news audience, particularly younger and better-educated Americans, and
those seeking financial information, are turning increasingly to the Internet.
The Web's rapid growth as a source for news continues a splintering of that
audience among the Internet, cable and broadcast television, and print
publications. A third of the public now goes online for news at least once a
week, compared to a fifth two years ago, according to a Pew Research poll.
Fifteen percent get daily reports from the Internet, almost three times the
number two years ago.

AMA Struggling To Attract Members
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- The American Medical Association is asking doctors to become
salespeople to boost its flagging membership. While it remains America's largest
group of doctors, only about a third of the nation's 800,000-plus physicians,
medical residents and medical students belong. Membership, now at 293,695, is
down about 2 percent from the end of last year, Dr. E. Ratcliffe Anderson Jr,
the AMA's executive vice president, told delegates attending the first day of
the annual AMA meeting today. The declining membership has been attributed
largely to doctors' reluctance to pay the relatively high association fee for
what they get in return -- a lobbying voice in Washington.

Study: Most Death Row Cases Flawed
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A study of 4,578 death penalty appeals from 1973 through
1995 show that two-thirds of the appeals were successful, increasing the debate
over capital punishment. Most cases ''are so seriously flawed that they have to
be done over again,'' said Columbia University law professor James Liebman, the
lead author. Texas Gov. George W. Bush recently approved his first 30-day
reprieve in a death penalty case -- to allow time for DNA testing -- after
permitting 131 executions. Public support for capital punishment remains high.

Zimbabwe Criticizes U.N. Monitoring
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Zimbabwe's president accused the United Nations of
trying to hijack international monitoring of his country's parliamentary
elections, which many doubted could be free and fair amid rampant political
violence, a newspaper reported Sunday. The United Nations overstepped its
welcome in trying to coordinate election monitoring, President Robert Mugabe
complained to a state newspaper, a week after U.N. observers pulled out of the
country's election monitoring operations.

Vice President Gore Hits N.Y. Media
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After a media-heavy kickoff in New York City, Vice
President Al Gore's ''progress and prosperity tour'' this week will concentrate
on the Pennsylvania and Ohio battlegrounds, aides said. Together, those states
offer 44 of the 270 electoral votes Gore will need to defeat Republican
presidential rival George W. Bush in November. The most recent statewide polls
suggested what amounts to a dead heat in both states, with Bush just a whisper
ahead in Ohio.

Assad's Son Moves Closer to Syria Presidency
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -- Bashar Assad, son of the late Syrian leader, was
unanimously nominated as the only presidential candidate Sunday, another
indication he will succeed his father. The ruling Baath Party also appointed
Bashar commander of the armed forces. President Hafez Assad, who died Saturday,
was the previous commander. In anointing Bashar Assad, the hierarchy is opting
for a smooth, stable transition. All that is left is for the rubber-stamp
parliament, which is scheduled to meet June 25, to approve the nomination and
for elections to be held.

Rival Jewish Groups Trade Barbs
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- An angry dispute has broken out between two rival Jewish
groups, with one alleging that the Kremlin is meddling in the community's
politics -- a rollback to the Soviet era, when the Communist leadership kept
religious groups on a short leash. The rift between followers of Russia's chief
rabbi, Adolf Shayevich, and a group led by the ultra-Orthodox Chabad Lubavitch
movement became public last month after Shayevich wrote President Vladimir Putin
a letter about it. In the letter, Shayevich claimed the Kremlin had snubbed him
by initially not inviting him to Putin's inauguration or the anniversary
celebration of the end of World War II. He said representatives of the Lubavitch
movement had been invited from the start.

<HEADLINE> Fourth county joins push for Southern Tier rail authority  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BATH, N.Y. (AP) - Steuben County this week became the fourth of
four counties eager for a state-designated railroad authority to
revive the Southern Tier Extension.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation pending in Albany would create a four-county
organization that would take over the 146-mile railroad that
extends from Hornell to the Pennsylvania line near Corry, Pa. and
has the distinction of being the shortest rail route between New
York and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Other counties seeking the authority are Chautauqua, Cattaraugus
and Allegany.
</P>
<P>
   Area leaders cite a range of possibilities, from new economic
development to the dream of local passenger rail service.
</P>
<P>
   Stoner Horey, Steuben County's legislative chairman, said the
Southern Tier Extension could provide a ''release valve'' for
congested rail traffic on the northern rail line from Albany to
Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   ''It (could) restore the east-west transportation route that's
been moribund for years,'' Horey said.
</P>
<P>
   The authority would assume ownership of the line from Norfolk
Southern, which along with CSX Corp. has been troubled by service
and safety problems - as well as plummeting stock prices -
resulting from their June 1, 1999 breakup of Conrail, Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ''Norfolk Southern has let it be known they are not interested
in upgrading the route,'' Horey said, adding that the company
probably wouldn't mind shedding its approximately $2 million
property tax burden for the route.
</P>
<P>
   The authority would be tax exempt.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-member authority would consist of three members from each
county. Already $1.1 million in federal intermodal transport funds
administered by the state appears set aside for upgrades on a route
that has deteriorated over the past 25 years. Horey said all that
was needed now was the state Legislature's nod.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many of the state's authorities, this one would not have
borrowing power, which would have been a sticking point for a
governor criticized like his predecessors for ''backdoor''
borrowing by authorities.

<HEADLINE> World Cup Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Canada advanced to the
semifinals of
regional qualifying for the 2002 World Cup, playing a scoreless tie
with Cuba on Sunday night to advance 1-0 in the home-and-home,
total-goals playoff.
<TEXT>
<P>
   After winning 1-0 on June 4 at Havana, Canada knew going in it
would advance with a scoreless tie and, despite missing several
scoring chances, extended its unbeaten streak to 15 games.
</P>
<P>
   Canada, which hasn't qualified for the World Cup since 1986,
joins Group C of the semifinals in the North and Central American
and Caribbean region, where it will play a double round-robin
series with Mexico, Panama and Trinidad and Tobago starting next
month.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's other game, Guillermo Ramirez scored in the 32nd
minute, leading Guatemala over Antigua and Barbuda 1-0 in the first
leg of their playoff.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of that series advances to Group E, where it will
join the United States, Costa Rica and Barbados.
</P>
<P>
   The top two nations in each of the three semifinal groups group
advance to the six-nation finals of the CONCACAF region, which will
produce three qualifiers for the 32-nation tournament, to be played
in Japan and South Korea in 2002. The United States had a bye until
the semifinals of qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   Guatemala played Sunday at St. John's, Antigua. The second leg
of the Antigua-Guatemala series is scheduled for next weekend at
Guatemala City.
</P>
<P>
   ''We missed our chances,'' said Antigua coach Zoran Varnesh,
upset his team missed three good first-half chances.
</P>
<P>
   The third semifinal group includes El Salvador, St. Vincent and
the Grenadines, and the winner of the Haiti-Honduras playoff.
Honduras won 4-0 last week in the first leg.

<HEADLINE> Solomons Cease-Fire End Feared  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM FOREMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONIARA, Solomon Islands (AP) -- A new group of militants gunned
down a man Sunday in the Solomon Islands, officials said, a killing
that diplomats feared could end a fragile cease-fire and spark
another cycle of revenge attacks in the South Pacific nation.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting came as a new wave of foreign tourists and workers,
many pushing carts piled high with luggage, lined up at the airport
in the capital, Honiara to be evacuated. At a nearby port, hundreds
of local residents squeezed on board crowded ferries, fleeing the
city to other provinces.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the evacuations, Honiara appeared relatively calm. No
gunfire could be heard, as in past days, and armed rebels who
seized the prime minister and took control of the capital last week
were no longer cruising the capital's streets.
</P>
<P>
   But the fatal shooting Sunday in Gizo, the capital of Western
Province, appeared to be politically motivated and stirred fears of
new violence in Honiara.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the killing were sketchy because telephone service in
Gizo was down, but a rebel leader and local media blamed the death
on militants from Bougainville, an island in Papua New Guinea.
Bougainville was the scene of a 10-year secessionist war that
killed thousands before a 1998 cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   ''I suspect they are offering themselves as mercenaries,'' said
Andrew Nori, a former lawmaker and leader of rebels from the island
of Malaita.
</P>
<P>
   The militants' mission ''is to evict the Malaitans from the
Western Province,'' Nori said, adding that the victim was Malaitan.
</P>
<P>
   Kicking the Malaitans off the main island of Guadalcanal has
also been the goal of the Isatabus. During the past 18 months, the
Isatabus have forced about 20,000 migrant Malaitans back to
Malaita.
</P>
<P>
   Angry that they have received no compensation for their losses,
the Malaitans have taken up arms and demanded the resignation of
Prime Minister Bartholomew Ulufa'alu. The leader faces a vote of no
confidence in the parliament on Thursday. Ulufa'alu is a Malaitan,
but his people accuse him of being too soft on the Isatabus.
</P>
<P>
   If lawmakers vote to keep Ulufa'alu in office, many fear that
the Malaitans will refuse to handover their weapons and instead use
them to stage another coup. Although Nori is believed to want
peace, it was unclear how much influence he had over rebels who are
growing bolder after their recent successes.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand's foreign minister, Phil Goff, said Monday that
Ulufa'alu is worried about being killed by the rebels and would
probably step down within days. Goff was part of a delegation that
visited the Solomon Islands over the weekend to seek a solution to
the political crisis and rebel warring.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a situation in the Solomons where a prime minister is
in fear of his life ... who will resign this week, I am sure,
because the cost of staying in power ... is too great,'' Goff said
in Wellington, New Zealand's capital.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels, or Malaita Eagle Force, have been trying to win the
public over by keeping order in Honiaria, where looting and other
lawlessness have been rare. Police said the fighters have taken
over police duties and even use Honiaria's jail to lock up rebels
who have misbehaved.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have our guns and everything, so we're just sitting back
and relaxing,'' said police Sgt. Alec Toata, pointing to a long,
empty rifle rack in the main police station. ''People now call
them, not us.''
</P>
<P>
   Up the street from the police station, rebels with teeth stained
red from chewing betel nut, a mild stimulant, lounge around in lawn
chairs outside their barracks, a drab office building they seized
from the provincial government of Guadalcanal.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a baseball cap with the word ''Police'' on it, rebel
Charles Addix stood behind a counter in a small office and helped a
woman file a claim for luggage lost on a ferry boat. He dismissed
the exodus of people from the capital as irrational panic and said
they would return in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Foreigners should feel safe here,'' Addix said. ''Our problem
is only with the Isatabu Freedom Movement.''

<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- J.H. Carmical, who covered the stock market crash
of 1929 as a reporter for The New York Times, died Friday of
complications from injuries suffered after a fall. He was 104.

in 1917. He moved to New York and worked as a financial analyst for
J.P. Morgan Co. He became a financial writer for the Times in 1922.
</P>
<P>
   At the Times, he traveled the world following the developments
of oil fields, the transformation of the railroad industry from
steam to diesel engines, and the Great Depression.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, after 50 years in New York, Carmical returned to a home

<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Garrett Eckbo, a leader of the modern
landscape architecture movement, died May 14 after suffering a
stroke. He was 89.
</P>
<P>
   Eckbo, who studied under Bauhaus founder Walter Gropius, did his
first major work at migrant farmworkers' encampments in the Central
Valley for the New Deal-era Farm Security Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Eckbo, who was born in Cooperstown, N.Y, and grew up in Alameda,
went on to design gardens for Hollywood luminaries including Gary
Cooper and Louis B. Mayer.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, for the Beverly Hills swimsuit company Cole of
California, Eckbo designed a pool with a series of diving platforms
that allowed models to disappear unnoticed into its depths and
surface like Esther Williams.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, he banned cars from the center of the University
of New Mexico when he designed new outdoor spaces to unify the
sprawling campus. He also created the Fresno Mall, the first
pedestrian mall in the middle of a California city.

Michaela Odone
</P>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Michaela Odone, whose efforts to develop a
treatment for her son's rare disease inspired the movie ''Lorenzo's
Oil,'' died Saturday of lung cancer at her home in Fairfax. She was
61.
</P>
<P>
   Odone and her husband, Augusto, had no medical training but
helped develop a combination of olive and rapeseed oils that they
used to treat their son Lorenzo's rare degenerative brain disease,
adrenoleukodystrophy.
</P>
<P>
   The oil stopped the progression of Lorenzo's disease and allowed
the boy, once in a vegetative state, to communicate slightly with
hand signals.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers were initially skeptical but clinical studies showed
that the treatment worked about half the time if administered in
the disease's early stages.
</P>
<P>
   ''The definitive truth will only come in 10 to 15 years,''
Augusto Odone said in a telephone interview Sunday. ''It's still
under scrutiny. The verdict is still out.''
</P>
<P>
   After 13 years of treatment, Lorenzo, now 22, is ''holding his
own,'' he said.
</P>

   In the 1992 movie, Michaela and Augusto Odone were played by
Susan Sarandon and Nick Nolte.

<HEADLINE> Pacers 100, Lakers 91  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Back home in Indiana, the Pacers relaxed
instead of panicked and allowed themselves to breathe easier in the
NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Getting 33 points and one angry glance from Reggie Miller, 21
points from Jalen Rose and a number of timely shots from Travis
Best, the Pacers looked like a different team as they defeated the
Los Angeles Lakers 100-91 Sunday night in Game 3 of the
best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
   Playing brazenly, refusing to be pushovers and eager to get in
the Lakers' faces, the Pacers certainly didn't act as inferior as
they looked in Games 1 and 2 in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they took a double-digit lead early, went ahead by as
many as 18 points and held off the Lakers' rally in the fourth to
cut their deficit to 2-1 in the series.
</P>
<P>
   Miller all but sealed the victory by making two free throws with
2:02 left, casting an angry stare at Lakers coach Phil Jackson as
he turned upcourt. After Ron Harper hit a 3-pointer to make it a
three-point game with 14.8 seconds left, Miller calmly made two
from the line -- sans the stare this time, but with an emphatic
side-to-side shake of his head -- to make it 96-91.
</P>
<P>
   Best had 14 points and Austin Croshere added 12 for the Pacers,
who were not afraid to confront the Lakers -- whether it be with
flagrant fouls, dirty looks or timely shots.
</P>
<P>
   Despite not making a fourth-quarter field goal for the third
straight game, Miller had his best game of the series as he shot
11-for-22 and played 46 of a possible 48 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll rest when I'm dead,'' Miller said at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to his energy, chutzpah and foul shooting, the Pacers are
far from dead heading into Game 4 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the Lakers could have Kobe Bryant back in the lineup.
He never showed his face, staying in the locker room for the entire
game after testing his sprained left ankle and deciding it was too
sore to play on.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers missed Bryant's offense, getting just six points from
Brian Shaw, his replacement in the starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal followed up his 43-point Game 1 and 40-point
Game 2 with a 33-point, 13-rebound performance, but he went just
3-for-13 at the line, missing six of seven free throws in the
fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Harper added 14 points, and Robert Horry and Derek Fisher
had 10 apiece for the Lakers, who shot just 8-for-19 at the foul
line and were outrebounded badly in the first half when Indiana
took control for good.
</P>
<P>
   After the Lakers pulled within five points early in the third,
Indiana used a 23-8 run to reassert command. And after the Lakers
got their deficit back down to three late in the fourth, the Pacers
nonchalantly closed them out.
</P>
<P>
   It was quite a change of character for a Pacers team that looked
meek and humble on the road. Mark Jackson took pleasure in baiting
the Lakers and showboating, Rose and Croshere wore their tough-guy
faces when needed and the entire Indiana mentality seemed to get
under the skin of the Lakers, especially coach Phil Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   If the Lakers want to do something about it, they'll have to
avoid the kind of slow start that allowed their opponents to get
into a comfort zone so early.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw started in Bryant's place and wasn't shy about shooting the
ball, taking five of the Lakers' first 12 attempts while O'Neal had
just one.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, after throwing the ball away and dribbling it off his
foot and out of bounds in the first few minutes, hit a 3-pointer on
the fast break for a 17-10 lead. A jump hook by Rik Smits gave
Indiana its first double-digit lead, 23-12.
</P>
<P>
   Miller kept going into the air trying to draw fouls, repeatedly
getting upset when the refs wouldn't call them. He finally got a
whistle going for a layup over O'Neal, and his free throw for a
three-point play made it 30-19.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers started going more to O'Neal in the second quarter
but never developed much of a rhythm, while Indiana used its
superiority on the boards to widen its lead.
</P>
<P>
   A tip-in by Dale Davis off Indiana's seventh offensive rebound
made it 42-27 before Los Angeles had an 10-2 run to pull within
seven. Best took the momentum right back by hitting two jumpers and
making a steal that led to a layup by Miller, and Rose made it
53-39 with 4.9 seconds left before the half on a steal, layup and
foul shot.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers committed five fouls in the first 2:55 of the third
quarter and missed their first six shots, allowing the Lakers to
pull to 55-50. But Rose hit a jumper, Miller hit a tough bank shot,
Rose hit a jumper on the break and Jackson drilled a 3-pointer to
quickly restore the 12-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than rest after restoring that comfortable advantage, the
Pacers kept pouring it on. Rose had a steal and dunk, and Sam
Perkins hit a 3-pointer as the crowd yelled his nickname --
''Smooth'' -- while the ball was in mid-flight.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers answered with four straight points before Miller
slammed the door, hitting a jumper before coming up with another
steal and then pulling up for a 3-pointer, thrusting both hands in
the air and playing to the crowd, for a 76-58 lead.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Davis had two points and 12 rebounds before fouling out
with 1:50 left. ... Toronto center Antonio Davis, traded from
Indiana to the Raptors last summer, sat in a courtside seat and
received a rousing ovation when introduced during a first-quarter
timeout. ... After reviewing videotape of Game 2, the league
rescinded the flagrant foul called on O'Neal midway through the
fourth quarter.

<HEADLINE> Witnesses Recall La. Church Terror  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GONZALES, La. (AP) -- There haven't been regular services at the
New St. John Fellowship Church since March 10, 1999, the day
prosecutors say Shon Miller walked through the church doors, fired
two shots into the ceiling and asked, ''Who's going to save you
now?''
</P>
<P>
   Jurors hearing Miller's trial on four counts of murder and four
of attempted murder walked through those same doors on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, church deacon Donald Ray Smith recounted for the jury
what he saw that night, starting with Miller's 2-year-old son, Shon
Jr., turning in his seat and with a big smile saying, ''Daddy!'' as
Miller walked in.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, 23, answered: ''Son, don't call me Daddy now,'' Smith
told the jury. Then, he said, Miller opened fire, hitting and
killing his wife, Carla Vessel Miller, 25, Shon Jr., and Vaniaro
Jackson, 19.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said Miller reloaded and continued firing into Carla
Miller's body. Other witnesses, four of whom were wounded during
the shooting, testified in court to the same events.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who was paralyzed from the waist down by a shot from a
deputy's gun, didn't return to the church with the jury.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to be there. I've had enough nightmares about it
already,'' Miller told District Judge Alvin Turner Jr.
</P>
<P>
   His trial was to resume Monday. Prosecutors are seeking the
death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's attorney, Raymond Gautreau, said in opening statements
that Miller was in an alcohol-induced blackout at time of shootings
and doesn't remember them.
</P>
<P>
   His attempt last week to change Miller's plea from innocent to
innocent by reason of insanity was denied.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the charges involving the seven parishioners,
Miller is charged with killing his mother-in-law, Mildred Vessel,
53, as she sat in her van in front of her house, a short way from
the church.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier that day, Carla Miller told her estranged husband she
had filed for divorce, prosecutor Robin O'Bannon told the jury.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Miller had viciously beaten his wife, slashed
her car tires and burned her mobile home after they separated.
</P>
<P>
   Seven bullets were found in her body after it was removed from
the church.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was intense with a fury. He moved with nimble feet. His
eyes ... fury came out with every gunshot,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   ''His eyes were red and he looked like he was 20 feet tall,''
said Rebecca Delpit, 38. She said she was protecting her baby and
praying when Miller shot her. The bullet went in her shoulder and
is still lodged in her neck, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Miller was found soon after the shootings in a shed at a home
less than a mile from the church.
</P>
<P>
   Police spent an hour trying to persuade Miller to surrender
while he pointed his gun at himself and talked of voices telling
him commit suicide and hurt others, officials said. When police
stormed in, one officer fell and his pistol went off. The bullet
lodged near Miller's spine, paralyzing him.

<HEADLINE> Fugitive Paraguayan Arrested  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazilian police on Sunday
arrested a former Paraguayan army chief wanted in connection with
last year's assassination of his country's vice president,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Lino Oviedo was arrested at a friend's apartment in Foz do
Iguacu, on Brazil's southwestern border with Paraguay and
Argentina. The popular tourist resort is 800 miles southwest of Rio
de Janeiro but just 220 miles east of Asuncion, the capital of
Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
   A federal police agent, who asked not to be identified,
confirmed the arrest but said he could not provide further details.
</P>
<P>
   Oviedo had been sought for his alleged involvement in the 1999
murder of Paraguay's Vice President Luis Argana.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say the assassination of Argana occurred after
Oviedo was released from a Paraguayan jail, where he served just 6
months of a 10-year sentence in connection with a failed coup in
1996. After the murder, Oviedo first fled to Argentina, where he
was granted political asylum, before going to Brazil. The ex-army
chief is also blamed for another failed coup in Paraguay on May 18.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his capture, police found a loaded revolver in
the apartment, but Oviedo did not resist the arrest, Globonews
television reported.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities had been searching the southern border since the
beginning of the month in hopes of finding Oviedo, who had sought
protection from arrest and possible extradition through his lawyers
in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   An order for Oviedo's arrest had been issued at the request of
the Paraguayan government. Argana's family had offered a $100,000
reward for his capture.

Study: Most Death Row Cases Flawed
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two-thirds of death penalty cases that were appealed from
1973 through 1995 were successful, report researchers who contend the nation's
capital punishment system is ''collapsing under the weight of its own
mistakes.'' A study of 4,578 appeals during those years showed that most cases
''are so seriously flawed that they have to be done over again,'' said Columbia
University law professor James Liebman, the lead author. The study comes at a
time of increased debate over capital punishment. Earlier this year, Republican
Gov. George Ryan of Illinois imposed a moratorium on capital punishment in his
state after 13 death row inmates were exonerated.

Attack Reported on Solomon Islands
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   HONIARA, Solomon Islands (AP) -- A new group of militants gunned down a man
Sunday in the Solomon Islands, officials said, a killing that diplomats feared
could end a fragile cease-fire and spark another cycle of revenge attacks in the
South Pacific nation. The shooting came as a new wave of foreign tourists and
workers, many pushing carts piled high with luggage, lined up at the airport in
the capital, Honiara to be evacuated. Despite the evacuations, Honiara appeared
relatively calm. No gunfire could be heard, as in past days, and armed rebels
who seized the prime minister and took control of the capital last week were no
longer cruising the capital's streets.

Web Attracts Younger News Audience
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new poll on media trends says key segments of the
nation's news audience, particularly younger and better-educated Americans, and
those seeking financial information, are turning increasingly to the Internet.
The Web's rapid growth as a source for news continues a splintering of that
audience among the Internet, cable and broadcast television, and print
publications. A third of the public now goes online for news at least once a
week, compared to a fifth two years ago, according to a Pew Research poll.
Fifteen percent get daily reports from the Internet, almost three times the
number two years ago.

Bashar Ascension May Set Precedent
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Bashar Assad's imminent rise to the presidency of Syria
could turn an idea many Arab leaders have nurtured for years into a precedent:
grooming their sons to establish ''republican dynasties'' to ensure that power
remains in the family after they're gone. The transition of power from father to
son has gone smoothly in Jordan, Morocco, Bahrain and Qatar -- all monarchies.
Before President Hafez Assad's death Saturday, the phenomenon had never been
tried in a republic.

Alaska Air Pilot Doubted Safety

   SEATTLE (AP) -- A veteran Alaska Airlines pilot wrote a letter to a company
executive saying he was worried about the safety of an airplane he flew May 30
and suggesting the company needs to improve its maintenance. Capt. David
Crawley, who has flown Alaska Airlines planes since 1984, told the executive he
became deeply concerned after reviewing maintenance reports on the MD-80 he flew
that day from Los Angeles to Seattle, The Seattle Times reported today. ''As we
accelerated down the runway, I thought about how all this would look for Alaska
Airlines if this airplane did not make it to Seattle,'' Crawley wrote.

NAACP Head Shinhoster Dies in Crash
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Earl T. Shinhoster, who was acting executive
director of the NAACP in the early 1990s, died in a car crash today at age 47.
The driver of a car Shinhoster was riding in apparently lost control after a
tire blew out off Interstate 85 near Milstead, about 25 miles east of
Montgomery, said Cpl. Damon Summers. The car went off the interstate,
overturned, and hit a tree, killing Shinhoster. Shinhoster, a Savannah, Ga.
native, was the director of the NAACP's People's Voter Empowerment project, a
national voter registration and education program. Shinhoster was with the NAACP
for 30 years, and served in several senior positions, including national field

<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Reggie Miller scored 31 points, Jalen Rose added 21 and
a number of timely shots from Travis Best helped the Indiana Pacers defeat the

ahead by as many as 18 points and held off the Lakers' rally in the fourth to
cut their deficit to 2-1 in the series. Game four is Wednesday night at Indiana.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Asks UN For Money For Supplies  </HEADLINE>
By WAIEL FALEH
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Iraq asked the United Nations on Sunday to
free up $400 million from the surplus in an escrow account to
purchase humanitarian supplies for the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
   The request came in a letter from Foreign Minister Mohammed
Saeed al-Sahhaf to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and was
carried by the official Iraqi News Agency.
</P>
<P>
   ''I call upon you to transfer these funds to buy humanitarian
supplies for Iraqis instead of keeping them useless in the escrow
account,'' said al-Sahhaf in his letter.
</P>
<P>
   The oil-for-food program allows Iraq to circumvent U.N. economic
sanctions and sell oil under U.N. supervision. However, the money
earned has to be deposited in an escrow account in a French bank
and can only be used to buy food and humanitarian goods after every
contract has been approved by the U.N. sanctions committee.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Deputy Agriculture Minister Basil al-Dalali said
over $7 billion is frozen in the account.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued May 30, the U.N Iraqi Program's Office
estimated that 1,185 contracts worth $1.68 billion are being held
by the sanctions committee. Sanctions were imposed after Iraq's
1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Sahhaf blamed the U.S. and British representatives for the
contract delays.
</P>
<P>
   ''They approve a contract for a machine, putting on hold another
contract for parts needed to make the machine work,'' said
al-Sahhaf in his letter.
</P>
<P>
   He asked Annan to apply pressure on the United States and
Britain to ''stop this abnormal situation.''
</P>
<P>
   ''These governments must understand that their criminal policy
toward Iraq, which is causing the death of many children, women and
elderly, shall bring shame to them in the present and the future.''

<HEADLINE> Mets-Yankees Postponed By Rain  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The final game of the Mets-Yankees Subway Series
was rained out Sunday night before the teams could complete the
third inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees led 1-0 when the game was stopped with one out in
the bottom of the third. Lightning flashed just outside Yankee
Stadium and there was a big clap of thunder before the umpires
called for the tarp to be put on the field.
</P>
<P>
   The rain got heavier during the delay and the game was called
after a wait of 1 hour, 31 minutes, sending home an unhappy sellout
crowd. No makeup date was immediately announced.
</P>
<P>
   The teams have only one common off-day the rest of the season,
Aug. 31. The Mets end a homestand the day before and head to St.
Louis on Sept. 1. The Yankees end a West Coast trip on Aug. 30. The
teams also could play on July 12, the day after the All-Star game.
</P>
<P>
   David Cone, who struggled with a 1-6 record and 6.49 ERA
entering the game, didn't allow a hit through three innings. He
walked two and struck out four.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching on five days rest -- one more than usual -- Cone once
again looked dominant. He got Edgardo Alfonzo to wave at a slider
to end the first inning, and froze Mike Piazza on an inside
fastball to open the second. Only one ball was hit to the outfield,
a harmless fly to right by Todd Zeile.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two seasons, Cone has excelled with extra rest. He
is 10-7 with a 2.70 ERA with at least five days between starts, and
3-8 with a 6.31 ERA with four days off.
</P>
<P>
   He has struggled especially since pitching a perfect game last
July 18 against Montreal, losing 11 of 14 decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees scored their only run in the second inning against
Mike Hampton, making his first career start at Yankee Stadium.
Shane Spencer walked to lead off the inning, went to third on Scott
Brosius' hit-and-run single and scored on a sacrifice fly by Chris
Turner.
</P>
<P>
   The teams split the first two games of the series and the
Yankees lead the Subway Series 8-6. They will meet again July 7-9
at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Game 3 of the NBA Finals between Indiana and Los Angeles
was shown on the scoreboard during the rain delay. ... The Yankees
start a series Monday against Boston, with Orlando Hernandez
pitching against Brian Rose. ... The Mets are off Monday before
playing a two-game set against the Cubs at Wrigley Field starting
Tuesday. ... Bernie Williams and Paul O'Neill were the only Yankees
in the starting lineup to face Hampton before Sunday. ... Hampton's
first career win came against the Yankees in relief for Seattle on
April 23, 1993. This was his first start against the Yankees. ...
Yankees 2B Chuck Knoblauch, who has not played since last Sunday
because of a sore left forearm, took BP but did not play.

<HEADLINE> Miller's Free Throws Holds Off LA  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE HERMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Reggie Miller still doesn't have a
fourth-quarter field goal in the NBA Finals. This time, his free
throws were good enough.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whenever you play, you've got to take as many free points as
possible,'' said Miller, who made all eight of his free throw
attempts in the final period as the Indiana Pacers held off Los
Angeles 100-91 Sunday night. The victory cut the Lakers' lead in
the best-of-seven series to 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   ''They way they're guarding me, I don't get a lot of wide-open
looks, a lot of easy looks. When I get to the free throw line, I've
got to make them,'' said Miller, who is 20-for-20 from the foul
line in the series.
</P>
<P>
   Miller made half of his 22 field goal attempts Sunday night, but
he took only one shot -- which he missed -- in the fourth quarter. In
a seven-point loss in Game 2, he took only two shots -- which he
also missed -- in the final period. He was scoreless in the fourth
quarter of Game 1, in which he finished with a playoff career-low
seven points.
</P>
<P>
   ''We like to get Reggie off the picks, but I think Reggie wore
down a little bit. You could see he didn't have the energy he did
earlier,'' said coach Larry Bird, who rested Miller only at the
start of the fourth quarter. ''But Reggie came through. He scored
33 points, and we need him to do that in the next game. We know
they're going to bounce back even harder the next time.''
</P>
<P>
   Game 4 will be Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of guys were very emotional tonight,'' Bird said. ''You
waste a lot of energy when you do that. But we battled today,
unlike the first game we played.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who had promised to be more aggressive with the series
in friendly Conseco Fieldhouse, had 16 points in the first half,
when the Pacers took a 53-42 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll rest when I'm dead,'' he said. ''This is the most
important game for us. We have to get back in the series.''
</P>
<P>
   With an 11-2 first-half run, including a rebound tip and a
3-pointer by Miller, the Pacers did just that. The big streak
followed the last of four early ties and put the Pacers up 19-10.
The Indiana defense, meanwhile, repeatedly double-teamed Shaquille
O'Neal every time he touched the ball, allowing him just two shots
and five points in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal finished with 33 points, but -- unlike Miller -- he was
just 3-of-13 from the free throw line.
</P>
<P>
   ''We came down hard on Shaq,'' Bird said. ''In the second half,
they got us in some trouble by going inside and then back out, but
we did a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller scored Indiana's first three baskets of the second
quarter, including a three-point play as he was fouled by O'Neal.
Austin Croshere, the steadiest reserve off the Indiana bench
through the series, matched a 3-pointer by Rick Fox and added three
free throws for a 38-26 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana's biggest lead in the first half was at 42-27 on a
rebound basket by Dale Davis, his only points of the game to go
along with 12 rebounds. The Pacers built it to 18 in the second
half before a final run by the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our defense picked up and we controlled the boards,'' Bird
said of the 39-33 Indiana edge in rebounding. ''We gave in a couple
times, but we were getting a little fatigued. But we made the
effort, and that was the key.''
</P>
<P>
   Jalen Rose added 21 points for the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wanted to come out earlier a little bit stronger,'' Rose
said. ''We get a lot of our energy off the crowd, and we made it
happen.''

<HEADLINE> Rockers Trade Michelle Edwards  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Cleveland Rockers guard Michelle Edwards, one
of the franchise's first players, was traded Sunday to the Seattle
Storm for the rights to Nina Bjedov.
</P>
<P>
   Bjedov, a 6-foot-6 center, is not playing in the WNBA this
season but is expected to return to the league in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, who was assigned to the Rockers on Jan. 22, 1997,
played 74 games with Cleveland, averaging 8.3 points, 2.6 rebounds
and 3.1 assists. This season she averaged 2.7 points and 5.7
minutes in two games.
</P>
<P>
   Bjedov has played one season in the WNBA, spending 1999 with Los
Angeles as Lisa Leslie's backup. She averaged 4.5 points and 2.6
rebounds for the Sparks.
</P>
<P>
   Bjedov, a native of Belgrade, Yugoslavia, decided to sit out
this season after playing last winter in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Rockers coach Dan Hughes said it was a hard decision to trade
Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   ''Michelle Edwards has meant a lot to this franchise both on the
court and off,'' he said. ''She has been with the team since the
beginning. We owe her the opportunity to be somewhere where she
will play.''

<HEADLINE> NBA Finals Notebook  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Glen Rice found out it's hard to be a team's
second option on offense while you're sitting on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Rice, the Los Angeles Lakers' third-leading scorer during the
regular season, scored just seven points -- none in the second half
-- in 27 minutes of play during the Lakers' 100-91 loss to the
Indiana Pacers in Game 3 of the NBA Finals on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of making up for the absence of Kobe Bryant, Rice was
shut down by Indiana's defenders early and by coach Phil Jackson
late, who used Robert Horry and Rick Fox in his place.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never really got into the offensive flow,'' Rice said. ''We
had poor execution, and once I went to the bench, I never got back
in it.''
</P>
<P>
   After playing the entire first quarter, Rice got just four
minutes in the second quarter but hit a 3-pointer in the final
second to cut Indiana's halftime lead to 53-42.
</P>
<P>
   But Rice went scoreless in the second half, missing all four of
his shots. He played just two minutes in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought they bodied Glen well off of any screens we tried to
provide for him,'' Jackson said. ''He caught the ball, (but) he was
crowded and pushed. ... They identified Glen very well, and I
thought they prevented him from getting good looks.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice had 21 points in Game 2 after Bryant sprained his left
ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't get too many chances tonight,'' Rice said. ''It just
wasn't there for us like it was in the first two games -- not just
me, but everybody.''

<P>
   THE FLAGRANT FOUL THAT WASN'T: Thanks to a little lobbying by
the Los Angeles Lakers, an apparent bad call against Shaquille
O'Neal in Game 2 of the NBA Finals was fixed two days later.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the NBA downgraded a flagrant foul called against
O'Neal to a personal foul, keeping the center on safe ground in the
league's discipline system of graduated points for violent fouls.
</P>
<P>
   With 6:40 left in the fourth quarter of Los Angeles' 111-104
victory in Game 2 on Friday night, O'Neal was called for a flagrant
foul against Indiana's Travis Best by referee Eddie F. Rush.
</P>
<P>
   Most observers of videotape replays at Staples Center not only
thought the foul wasn't especially flagrant, but that O'Neal
blocked Best's shot cleanly and didn't commit any foul.
</P>
<P>
   Rush's whistle may have been especially quick because of a play
moments earlier, when Best helped knock O'Neal onto his stomach
under the Lakers' basket.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal shot an NBA-record 39 free throws in the game. Afterward,
he complained about the call and hinted there was a double standard
on fouls committed against him.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles coach Phil Jackson said he asked Lakers GM Mitch
Kupchak to call the league and request a review. After watching the
videotape, newly appointed NBA senior vice president of basketball
operations Stu Jackson downgraded the foul to a personal foul.
</P>
<P>
   In the playoffs, a player is suspended for one game after
accumulating three flagrant foul points, with one point charged for
each flagrant foul.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was the potential for a situation arising there,''
Jackson said. ''Although (league officials) were on the move
yesterday, too, they were willing to address it.''
</P>

   SINGIN' IN THE RAIN: Intermittent rain showers and a thick
coat of humidity couldn't dampen the spirits of Pacers fans on the
streets around Conseco Fieldhouse before Sunday's Game 3, the first
home Finals game in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   A band at the pep rally across the street from the arena was
quieted when tarpaulins were draped over their musical instruments,
but fans still milled about in Pacers gear and gathered to meet
Indiana's dance squad. Several hundred fans gathered in a parking
lot to watch the game on a big-screen TV.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets were at a premium in Indianapolis. One scalper told a
local television station he was offering $10,000 apiece to those
holding tickets in the front rows -- but hadn't found any takers for
his offer.
</P>
<P>
   Crosswalks near the arena are painted blue and gold. The
downtown canal is dyed blue, and the electronic signs on city buses
read ''Go Pacers.''
</P>
<P>
   Signs hung on the backs of the horse-drawn carriages that
strolled around Monument Circle, and even downtown window-washers
stuck ''Go Pacers'' bumper stickers on the bottoms of their lifts.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the building, yellow towels were draped over every chair.
The first 20,000 fans also received a T-shirt. Among the spectators
were everyone from Lakers stalwart and film director Penny Marshall
to Rick Fox's high school coach, Al Rhodes, from Warsaw, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, the Pacers played a video clip of one of Gene
Hackman's speeches in the film ''Hoosiers,'' as well as a message
from Indianapolis native David Letterman, who urged the Pacers to
''make Daddy proud.''
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Davis, traded by the Pacers to Toronto last summer,
watched from a courtside seat and got a standing ovation when shown
on the video board.
</P>

   GOOD CITIZEN: The league named Philadelphia 76ers guard Eric
Snow the winner of the annual NBA Sportsmanship Award on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Snow won the Joe Dumars Trophy and a $25,000 award which will be
divided equally among Hartford Middle School in Canton, Ohio --
Snow's alma mater -- and Simon Gratz High School in Philadelphia,
where the 76ers' Aaron McKie was a student.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers say paying parents should be in on progress  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Jacob Gunther was stunned when he was told
he'd have to have his daughter's permission to view her grades at
the state college she attends in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the 46-year-old Democratic state Assemblyman said, he
was the one writing out the checks for thousands of dollars to pay
for his daughter's schooling. Doesn't he have a right to updates on
his investment?
</P>
<P>
   A sea change in the way student records are handled occurred in
1974, when Congress passed the Family Educational Rights and
Privacy Act, commonly referred to the Buckley Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Buckley Amendment leaves it to the discretion of
individual institutions to decide whether to send grades to parents
when the student is a dependent, the message was apparently heard
loud and clear by college registrars, many of whom send collegial
report cards to students only.
</P>
<P>
   Gunther, of Sullivan County, has joined Sen. William Larkin, an
Orange County Republican, in trying to get a bill passed that would
require colleges in the state to send students' grades to parents
and guardians who bankroll at least half of their children's
education.
</P>
<P>
   ''A parent or guardian who is paying room, board and tuition is
absolutely entitled to see the grades,'' Gunther told the Sunday
Gazette of Schenectady.
</P>
<P>
   Some college administrators oppose the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Skidmore College in Sarataga Springs sends grades to students
only, unless the student fills out a waiver form. Of the 2,200
students attending Skidmore, about 100 have signed the consent
form, according to Ann Henderson, registrar and director of
institutional research at Skidmore.
</P>
<P>
   The college was sending grades to both parents and students when
Henderson arrived a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was not only a colossal duplication of effort because 98
percent of the time the address was the same (for both parents and
students), but it was not in keeping with the college's feeling
that students are emerging adults,'' Henderson said.

<HEADLINE> Stanford 10, Clemson 4  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LONG
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Stanford's John Gall didn't even think about
Sunday's graduation ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   He still wants the gifts, though.
</P>
<P>
   The first one came with the Cardinal's 10-4 victory over Clemson
at the College World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Gall was one of five Stanford seniors, joining Damien Alvarado,
Eric Bruntlett, Edmund Muth and Craig Thompson, who missed their
college graduation Sunday to play at Rosenblatt Stadium. None of
them seemed to mind.
</P>
<P>
   They all just crossed home plate instead of the stage.
</P>
<P>
   ''A win was our way to celebrate graduation,'' said Gall, who
went 2-for-3 against the Tigers. ''If there's any reason to miss
it, this is the reason. My parents are just glad I got the
degree.''
</P>
<P>
   The seniors, all starters, combined to go 6-for-21 with three
RBIs and each scored once. They gave starter Justin Wayne plenty of
support -- offensively and defensively.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne (15-3), the fifth overall pick in last week's amateur
draft by the Montreal Expos, scattered eight hits over 7 2-3
innings. He retired seven of the final 10 batters he faced before
giving way to Jeff Bruksch.
</P>
<P>
   Bruksch pitched 1 1-3 innings, giving up two runs in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne earned his fifth straight win and third this postseason.
He also set the school record for wins in a season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was just throwing strikes with the fastball and slider and
letting the defense do it behind me,'' Wayne said.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Borchard went 3-for-4 with two RBIs and scored three times.
Thompson had two of Stanford's 12 hits, all singles.
</P>
<P>
   ''We got some key hits,'' Stanford coach Mark Marquees said. ''I
don't think we got anything more than a single, but we got some
clutch hits. It's a huge win for us.''
</P>
<P>
   With the victory, Stanford gets to rest until Wednesday. The
Cardinal (49-15) will face whichever team comes out of the losers'
side of the bracket. Clemson (51-17) plays Louisiana-Lafayette
(48-19), which beat San Jose State 6-3, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're OK. It's going to be a tough task,'' Clemson starter
Kevin Lynn said. ''We just have to take it day by day. We can do
it. We've battled all year.''
</P>
<P>
   Borchard got Stanford on the board with a two-run single in the
third. Borchard scored two batters later on Chris O'Riordan's
single up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   After a one-hour rain delay, the Cardinal extended their lead to
4-0 with a run in the fourth. Lynn (5-2), making just his third
start of the season, gave up two infield singles and a walk to load
the bases before giving way to Mike Proto.
</P>
<P>
   ''The way we came back at it was huge,'' Borchard said.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn entered the game with a 3-0 record and 2.05 ERA over his
last 22 innings. He had 18 strikeouts and just one walk in that
span, but struggled with his control against Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   He allowed six hits and four runs. He also walked two, struck
out two, hit two batters and threw three wild pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really couldn't get into a groove that I felt comfortable
with,'' Lynn said.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers' bullpen didn't fare much better.
</P>
<P>
   Clemson used six more pitchers, combining to give up six hits
and six runs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody's gotten their feet wet out on the mound,'' Clemson
coach Jack Leggett said. ''It was a time to get them out there and
get them some experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Arik VanZandt gave Stanford a 6-0 lead with an RBI fielder's
choice in the fifth. O'Riordan scored on the play, as did Alvarado,
who came home on shortstop Jeff Baker's wild throw to first.
</P>
<P>
   O'Riordan made it 7-0 with a sacrifice fly in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal stranded nine runners on base -- six in scoring
position -- through six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Clemson scored two runs in the sixth off Wayne, but stranded 11
runners on base, including seven in scoring position. Casey Stone
and Henri Stanley each had three of the Tigers' 12 hits.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a rough game for us to lose,'' Leggett said. ''We
didn't get into the flow of the game early and it got us into
trouble. I thought we hit the ball better than what we got out of
it in the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanford put the game out of reach with a three-run eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just didn't come through with runners in scoring
position,'' Baker said. ''It's just the way the game goes
sometimes.''

<HEADLINE> LA's Bryant Sits Out Game 3  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NADEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Los Angeles Lakers standout Kobe Bryant sat
out Game 3 of the NBA Finals on Sunday night after spraining his
left ankle two nights earlier.
</P>
<P>
   And afterward, he was nowhere to be found.
</P>
<P>
   Without Bryant, the Lakers lost to the Indiana Pacers 100-91,
cutting their lead in the best-of-seven series to 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers coach Phil Jackson said Bryant put his shoes on and told
the coaching staff he wanted to give it a go some 35 minutes before
the game began.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to see him do some lateral slides, and I asked him
how it felt,'' Jackson said. ''He said, 'It hurts.' I said 'Well
then, let's save it. We can save this one.' It was a tough
decision, but I think it's better for us actually in the long run.
He accepted it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said Bryant received treatment during the game.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant's status for Game 4 on Wednesday night is uncertain, but
when asked if he thinks Bryant will play, teammate Derek Fisher
replied, ''It seems like it. I'm not exactly sure how painful it
is. We would hate to have him out there and not be Kobe.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Shaw, one of the Lakers' heroes in Game 7 of the Western
Conference finals on June 4, took Bryant's spot in the starting
lineup, and shot 3-for-10 in scoring six points while playing 31
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would have helped us (to have Bryant),'' Lakers guard Ron
Harper said. ''He's a guy who does so much for this team.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked what the Lakers missed most with Bryant on the
sidelines, forward Rick Fox said: ''It's his attacking presence, he
has a fearless way of attacking. We missed his defense, too. Not
that anyone else did a poor job. One more guy out there would have
been nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 90 minutes before the game began, while lying on a
training table in the Lakers' dressing room with his ankle being
stimulated electrically, Bryant indicated with a hand signal he was
uncertain as to his status.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, his ankle, which appeared slightly
discolored, was unwrapped and then packed in ice, and Bryant spoke
with team physician Dr. Steve Lombardo.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the media an hour and 45 minutes before game-time,
Jackson said the decision to play or not was basically up to
Bryant, ''although the doctors are influencing him, obviously.''
</P>
<P>
   ''But there's no structural damage to the ankle, per se,''
Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said at that stage he believed it was about 75-25 that
Bryant would sit out.
</P>
<P>
   ''Realistically speaking, Kobe won't be 100 percent for a
while,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson also said he hadn't given Bryant advice as to whether he
should try to give it a go or not, at least at that time.
</P>
<P>
   It was a different story a little later.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, a second-team All-NBA selection as well as first-team
all-defense pick, was injured while making his only shot of Game 2
on Friday night, a 17-foot jumper with 3:26 left in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   He landed on Jalen Rose' foot after releasing the shot, and went
down. Twenty-one seconds later, during the first available break,
Bryant was helped off the court.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers went on to win the game at Staples Center 111-104.
Bryant scored 14 points -- well below his playoff average of 21.2 --
in his team's 104-87 victory over the Pacers in Game 1.

<HEADLINE> K.C. Pitcher Wants To Avoid Surgery  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Ailing Kansas City Royals pitcher Jose
Rosado is not convinced that surgery is necessary, and wants to
maintain his rehabilitation program for now.
</P>
<P>
   Rosado said Saturday that if he makes no progress in another
month, he'll undergo arthroscopic surgery on his left shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got time,'' Rosado said. ''I'll keep battling.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors recently performed a dye-enhanced MRI on Rosado's
shoulder. Tests were not conclusive, but they indicated a cartilage
abnormality in the back of his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Royals general manager Herk Robinson described it as a fraying,
something not uncommon for major league pitchers. Robinson said
he'd like Rosado ''to make every effort to work through it.''
</P>
<P>
   ''When you're at this level, you don't want to have surgery if
you don't have to,'' the 25-year-old Rosado said.
</P>
<P>
   Rosado, a two-time All-Star, entered this season as the team's
No. 1 starter. But he was slowed by hamstring problems in spring
training and never found his rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after laboring through five starts with a 2-2 record
and 5.86 ERA, Rosado landed on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   ''I put too much pressure on my arm,'' Rosado said. ''I kept
saying, 'It's going to go away.' But I wasn't helping my team.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosado would like to travel with the team on the next road trip,
but it's more likely that manager Tony Muser will send him to
Florida to work on conditioning and throwing drills.

<HEADLINE> Lakers Unable To Win Without Bryant  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NADEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The Los Angeles Lakers did just fine without
Kobe Bryant for most of Game 2 in the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   It was a different story in Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   With Bryant sidelined because of a sprained left ankle, the
Lakers never led in dropping a 100-91 decision to the Indiana
Pacers on Sunday night, trimming their lead in the best-of-seven
series to 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were battling uphill it seemed like the whole time in the
second half,'' said Derek Fisher, who had 10 points and 10 assists
in a losing cause. ''We couldn't get over the hump.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers trailed by as many as 18 points late in the third
quarter before rallying within three in the late going.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not a major shift in momentum,'' Lakers guard Ron Harper
said of the Indiana victory. ''We killed ourselves. We know we
didn't do some stuff. We should have had this game. So, we are
still fine.
</P>
<P>
   ''We knew they were going to play harder at home. They've got
their fans, and they play good at home. We knew that. But we had a
chance, I thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant's absence was noticeable on both ends of the court as the
Lakers were unable to replace his 21.2-point playoff average or his
All-NBA first-team defense abilities.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant sprained his ankle late in the first quarter of Game 2 in
Los Angeles on Friday night, and didn't return. However, Harper and
Glen Rice picked up the slack with 21 points each to support
Shaquille O'Neal, who scored 40.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal had 33 points and 13 rebounds Sunday night, but didn't
get nearly as much help from his teammates as Harper scored 14
points, Rice had just seven and others faltered as well, especially
on the backboards.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana, the poorest rebounding team in the NBA during the
regular season, outrebounded the Lakers 39-33.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal was the only Los Angeles player to score in double
figures until Robert Horry's jumper 35 seconds into the fourth
quarter gave him 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   ''They played great defense on Glen tonight,'' Horry said. ''We
tried to run. They were right there like they were reading his
mind. We have to have a total team effort, not jump on Shaq's
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Shaw, who started in Bryant's place, scored only six
points on 3-of-10 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers did a terrific job defending Reggie Miller in the
first two games, as the Pacers' star shot 8-of-32. On Sunday,
Miller went 11-of-22 in scoring 33 points.
</P>
<P>
   ''You knew it was coming, sooner or later,'' forward Rick Fox
said of Miller's offensive production. ''They came home and played
like they did all year, which was much better than they did at
Staples Center (in Los Angeles).''
</P>
<P>
   Even with all their problems, the Lakers drew within four points
on Harper's twisting layup with 3:03 remaining, capping a 12-3 run.
</P>
<P>
   They got no closer until Harper made a 3-pointer with 14 seconds
left to make it 94-91, but Miller made four foul shots and Jalen
Rose added two more to clinch the victory for the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   The first 90 seconds of the second half personified the kind of
night it was for the Lakers, who trailed 53-42 at that stage.
</P>
<P>
   First, Rice simply dropped the ball out of bounds. Then, O'Neal
threw up an air ball from close range. Finally, Rice missed
everything on a 3-point shot, and looked to an official for a
whistle, which never came.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't play well in the first three quarters,'' O'Neal
said. ''It's not really anything they did. We shot ourselves in the
foot.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers missed their first six shots of the third quarter,
and the Lakers were in the bonus before the period was three
minutes old due to five Indiana fouls.
</P>
<P>
   Those factors helped the Lakers draw within five points, but
then, with nobody to stop Miller, the defense collapsed. The Pacers
rattled off 12 straight points to extend their lead to 69-52.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, who played the entire game, had another difficult night
at the foul line, going 3-of-13.
</P>
<P>
   Never were his problems more obvious than early in the fourth
quarter, when with the Pacers leading 79-68, he didn't come close
on two attempts, and with 1:50 left, when with Indiana ahead 93-87,
he missed another pair.

<HEADLINE> Devils return to N.J. with Stanley Cup  </HEADLINE>
By NINA RIZZO
<TEXT>
<P>
   TETERBORO, N.J. (AP) - Hours after wresting the Stanley Cup from
the defending champion Dallas Stars, the Devils were back in New
Jersey, to the cheers of a few faithful fans.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Arnott held the cup aloft as about two dozen fans cheered
in heat and humidity as stifling as the Devils' defense.
</P>
<P>
   The temperature was in the mid-90s when the team's chartered jet
touched down at about 3:45 p.m. Sunday at Teterboro Airport, a
small airfield used by many business, entertainment and sports
figures seeking an alternative to huge commercial airports.
</P>
<P>
   ''Words can't describe it,'' Ken Daneyko said of his emotion
after clinching the cup. ''Besides my kids being born, this is the
greatest feeling I've ever had in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Postolwski, a Mahwah computer artist, came with a camera
to get some snapshots.
</P>
<P>
   ''They showed a lot of heart to stick it in there when everyone
was writing them off,'' he said. ''It took a lot of guts and
courage.''
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen-year-old Kevin Makely of Hasbrouck Heights had a simple
goal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just want to touch the cup,'' he said. He didn't get to
touch it, but he stood and cheered along the exit of the Atlantic
Aviation terminal as the team's bus pulled out, en route to the
Continental Airlines Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a hard-fought series,'' said James Vera, 32. His aunt,
Sonia Fuentes, 57, of Hackensack, raised both fists and said, ''I'm
here to root the team on.''
</P>

   Christine Maita, a 26-year-old nurse from Little Ferry, brought
a Daneyko jersey with her, but it was too hot to wear, so she sat
on it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd just like to see them and get an autograph, but I don't
think it will happen,'' Maita said.
</P>
<P>
   A few lucky fans who gathered outside the arena did manage to
get autographs as the players scampered off the team bus and toward
their cars.
</P>
<P>
   Petr Sykora, who was hospitalized for observation Saturday night
after taking a blow to the head from Dallas Stars captain Derian
Hatcher in the first period, accompanied the team on the flight
home, but went straight to his car, still suffering from a
headache.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, were glad to oblige the fans.
</P>
<P>
   ''It feels great,'' Arnott added. 'It's a dream come true. Every
player dreams about this. The last couple of years, we had
something to prove.''
</P>
<P>
   Devils general manager Lou Lamoriello said the team never lost
its poise, even after falling behind at several spots during the
playoffs. He also said the team's second Stanley Cup was harder to
get than the first one in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone says it's more difficult when you've never won it
before,'' he said. ''But in my mind, the second one is harder
because you're expected to win it. And then if you don't, they
suspect something's wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is tremendous for hockey, and tremendous for the local
market and the fans. This was a special feat because we dethroned
last year's champions.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no word Sunday on when an official celebration and
parade would be held for the Devils.

<HEADLINE> NAACP Head Shinhoster Dies in Crash  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE WENDLING
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Earl T. Shinhoster, who was acting
executive director of the NAACP in the mid-1990s, died in a car
crash Sunday. He was 47.
</P>
<P>
   Shinhoster was a passenger in a car that apparently went out of
control after a tire blew, said state trooper, Cpl. Damon Summers.
The car went off the interstate, overturned and hit a tree, killing
Shinhoster.
</P>
<P>
   The crash happened off Interstate 85 near Milstead, about 25
miles east of Montgomery. State troopers are investigating.
</P>
<P>
   Shinhoster, who lived in DeKalb, Ga., was the director of the
NAACP's People's Voter Empowerment project, a national voter
registration and education program.
</P>
<P>
   ''Earl was one of the NAACP leaders who made this organization
work,'' NAACP president and CEO Kweisi Mfume said. ''He was part of
the NAACP family for all of his adult life and he will surely be
missed.''
</P>
<P>
   Shinhoster was with the organization for 30 years, and served in
several senior positions, including national field secretary. He
was the NAACP's acting executive director and CEO from February
1995 to February 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, he was involved in efforts to raise census
participation among blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Shinhoster had worked as a coordinator for voter education in
the Georgia Secretary of State's office. He also served as field
director for the National Democratic Institute in the west African
nation of Ghana, where he trained local citizens to serve as
election monitors.
</P>
<P>
   ''Earl was one of those people who made the NAACP the nation's
strongest civil rights organization,'' said John Johnson, the
NAACP's program director.
</P>
<P>
   He ''was totally committed to the cause of equal rights,''
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Julian Bond, the NAACP's national chairman, said Shinhoster
''literally devoted his life to the NAACP.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not just a tremendous organizational tragedy, but it's
a tremendous tragedy for his family,'' Bond said. ''He was a
vibrant guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Shinhoster is survived by his wife, Ruby, and son, Michael.

<HEADLINE> Canada 0, Cuba 0, Tie  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Canada advanced to the semifinals of
regional qualifying for the 2002 World Cup, playing a scoreless tie
with Cuba on Sunday night to advance 1-0 in the home-and-home,
total-goals playoff.
</P>
<P>
   After winning 1-0 on June 4 at Havana, Canada knew going in it
would advance with a scoreless tie and, despite missing several
scoring chances, extended its unbeaten streak to 15 games.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's an old law in football when you miss too many chances,
you may get punished,'' Canada coach Holger Osieck said. ''And they
had an opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Canada, which hasn't qualified for the World Cup since 1986,
joins Group C of the semifinals in the North and Central American
and Caribbean region, where it will play a double round-robin
series with Mexico, Panama and Trinidad and Tobago starting next
month.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've never really been the favorites before. It was a
different position for us. Everyone expected us to walk away easy
winners,'' Canada captain Jason deVos said. ''We could have scored
a few goals today. I think we were unlucky not to.''
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's other game, Guillermo Ramirez scored in the 32nd
minute, leading Guatemala over Antigua and Barbuda 1-0 in the first
leg of their playoff.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of that series advances to Group E, where it will
join the United States, Costa Rica and Barbados.
</P>
<P>
   The top two nations in each of the three semifinal groups group
advance to the six-nation finals of the CONCACAF region, which will
produce three qualifiers for the 32-nation tournament, to be played
in Japan and South Korea in 2002. The United States had a bye until
the semifinals of qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   Guatemala played Sunday at St. John's, Antigua. The second leg
of the Antigua-Guatemala series is scheduled for next weekend at
Guatemala City.
</P>
<P>
   ''We missed our chances,'' said Antigua coach Zoran Varnesh,
upset his team didn't connect on three good first-half
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The third semifinal group includes El Salvador, St. Vincent and
the Grenadines, and the winner of the Haiti-Honduras playoff.
Honduras won 4-0 last week in the first leg.
