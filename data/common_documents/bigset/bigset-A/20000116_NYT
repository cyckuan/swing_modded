Texas A&AMP;M beats Texas Tech on disputed buzzer-beater
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By NEIL HOHLFELD &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
LUBBOCK _ Talk about escaping with a win.
</P>
<P>
   After a bizarre finish Saturday night, Texas A&AMP;M hurriedly left
the United Spirit Arena with an 88-86 victory over Texas Tech.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies were on their team bus on the way to the Lubbock
airport even as a lengthy conference involving the officiating crew
and Texas Tech coach James Dickey was ongoing. The object of the
meeting was whether a put-back basket by Andy Leatherman beat the
buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   From the team bus, Aggies coach Melvin Watkins called from a
cellular phone to the press room at the arena and was put on a
speaker phone. Not exactly your run-of-the-mill postgame news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Did the Aggies scram in a hurry in order to make sure they
weren't called back to the court in the event the referees
determined Leatherman's basket came after the buzzer?
</P>
<P>
   ``You always worry about that,'' Watkins said. ``The one referee
(Charles Range) told me the basket was good, but you're always
concerned when there's that much discussion. But really, at that
point, what else do we have to stay around for?''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Tech's James Ware hit a 3-pointer to tie the score at 86
with 11 seconds to play. The Aggies' Bernard King fired up a
desperation shot with about 1.6 seconds left on the clock.
</P>
<P>
   King's shot glanced the bottom of the net. Leatherman, a 6-2
reserve walk-on guard, grabbed the ball with less than one second
left and put in an uncontested layup. TV replays indicated
Leatherman's shot came after the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the confusion began.
</P>
<P>
   Range ruled that Leatherman's basket beat the buzzer, and Dickey
went ballistic. Referee Eddie Jackson seemed to think the clock was
all zeroes when the basket went through.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief on-court conference, the referees appeared to rule
that Leatherman's shot was after the buzzer and an overtime was in
order. Then Watkins went ballistic. He and Range met in the tunnel
leading to the Aggies' locker room.
</P>
<P>
   Range came back to the court and told the other two referees and
Dickey that the game was over. Dickey went ballistic again, taking
off his sport coat, firing it over his head and stomping about the
court.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins, meanwhile, raced to the Aggies' dressing room, told his
players to throw on their clothes and get on the bus. Several
players had no time to waste on showers, the word was.
</P>
<P>
   For about 30 minutes, Dickey, Texas Tech athletic director
Gerald Myers and the three referees held a meeting off the court.
About 5,000 of the 14,324 fans remained in their seats, and the
Tech players huddled around their bench.
</P>
<P>
   At long last, Myers, as red-faced as the sweater he was wearing,
came out and told the public-address announcer to tell the fans the
game was over and the Red Raiders had lost 88-86.
</P>
<P>
   Long after the game, the officials met with a pool reporter and
gave a different version of the story Watkins had given during his
conference call. Range did admit there was disagreement over
whether the ball had gone in before the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if it was safe to say the referees agreed, Range
said, ``No, it's not safe to say that. It's safe to say I made the
call. My partners raised some questions with me. Based on that
questioning, I went to the monitor (to watch the replay.)''
</P>
<P>
   According to a source who was privy to what was said in the
meeting, however, the referees said they could not use a replay to
determine if the shot beat the buzzer. They can only use the replay
to determine if the clock was turned on properly at the start of
the play. A check of the Big 12 handbook found no mention of when
replay can or cannot be used.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins said Range told him Leatherman's basket was good, and
the game was over. When asked if he told Watkins that, Range said,
``No, I did not tell him that.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickey also said he was told by the referees they couldn't use a
replay to determine if the basket beat the buzzer. However, he said
that Texas Tech would file an appeal with the Big 12 Conference and
send in tapes of the final play.
</P>
<P>
   The chances of the call being overturned?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say it's not good,'' Dickey said. ``Most of us know how it
is in sports. Once it's over, it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversial finish nearly overshadowed an outstanding
effort by the Aggies, who snapped a four-game losing streak by
matching their best offensive output of the season. Carlton Brown
came off the bench to score 22 points in 21 minutes _ 18 of them in
the first half.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the Aggies reserves outscored the Texas Tech bench 47-6.
Leatherman added 12 points and Andy Slocum had nine. King, held
scoreless in the first half, scored 15 points in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies led 47-41 at the half, the first time they had the
lead after 20 minutes in their last eight games. They trailed 22-10
after 10 minutes, but Brown got hot and the Aggies (5-9, 1-2 Big
12) had the Red Raiders (9-4, 0-2) on the run.
</P>
<P>
   Five minutes into the second half, the Aggies increased their
lead to 62-50. Each time Texas Tech made a small run to close the
lead, the Aggies answered. When King hit a 3-pointer from beyond
the top of the key with 50 seconds left in the game, Texas A&AMP;M went
ahead 83-78.
</P>
<P>
   But the Red Raiders fought back and tied the score on Ware's
3-pointer, and overtime appeared imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Leatherman had other ideas. He slid under the basket unnoticed
and pushed in the game-winning shot. Was it before or after the
buzzer? Watkins, on his cell phone from the team bus, didn't even
want to hear about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a victory,'' Watkins said. ``What else would you
consider it?''

CONTROVERSIAL BASKET LIFTS TEXAS A&AMP;M PAST TEXAS TECH
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUBBOCK, Texas _ The shot by Texas A&AMP;M's Andy Leatherman kissed
the glass and ripped through the net at 7:09 p.m. yesterday evening
at Texas Tech's United Spirit Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-five minutes of mass confusion ensued before the Big 12's
three-man officiating crew determined Leatherman's attempt occurred
before the buzzer sounded and indeed counted as the game-winning
basket during the Aggies' 88-86 upset of the red-faced Red Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   Aggies coach Melvin Watkins did not wait for the final verdict
and added new meaning to the phrase ``start the bus.'' The
victorious Aggies (5-9, 1-2) departed the arena hurriedly, and
several players did not shower before leaving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my team to go to the locker room and let's go,''
Watkins informed reporters during a conference call from a cellular
telephone while aboard the Aggies' team bus. ``What else did we
need to hang around for?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, suppose the officiating crew altered the original decision
of Charles Range, who signaled without hesitation that Leatherman's
shot counted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the indication at one point that we were going to play
the overtime,'' said Red Raiders coach James Dickey, who
disappeared into the arena's bowels with officials for about 30
minutes after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Aggies guard Bernard King took what appeared would be the final
shot of regulation, but his rushed, off-balance attempt failed to
draw iron or glass. The basketball fell harmlessly into the hands
of an alert Leatherman, who scored uncontested.
</P>
<P>
   The jubilant Aggies and their coach rushed toward the visitors'
dressing room before disorder began. Dickey pleaded with officials
to view the replay from television monitors located at courtside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the parameters of using replay are, but I do
believe the bottom line is to get it right,'' Dickey said. ``We're
not talking about an out-of-bounds call or where the shot clock is
at.''
</P>
<P>
   The officials viewed the replays and appeared to reverse Range's
original decision, but Range also conferred with Watkins in the
corridor that leads to the arena's floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I made a decision. The basket is good. Will you
support me?''' Watkins recalled of their conversation in the
tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I'm supporting you,'' Watkins recalled telling Range.
``Then, I left. I don't know what they were talking about after
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Range did not share Watkins' perception of that conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not tell him that the game was over,'' Range said.
</P>
<P>
   Official Paul Janssen said the crew went to the monitor to make
sure the clock started on time when the Aggies inbounded the ball
with 8.6 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't going to get into all these extraneous things,''
Janssen said. ``We conferred. Charlie counted the shot as good, and
the game is done.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Tech athletic director Gerald Myers plans to file a report
with the Big 12 and let the conference office determine if any
action will be taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worked a lot of Sundays,'' Myers said. ``It will be
soon.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Aggies were on their bus, the Red Raiders (9-4, 0-2)
waited on the court for 45 minutes before being informed of the
officials' final decision. Many of the 14,324 spectators waited
with them.
</P>
<P>
   Reserve forward Carlton Brown helped the Aggies pull the upset
by scoring 18 of his team-high 22 points during the first half, and
the Red Raiders _ who led the Big 12 in field goal-percentage
defense _ allowed Texas A&AMP;M to shoot 48.4 percent from the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think we were as good defensively as we have been,
and they were good offensively,'' said Dickey, who did not address
the media until 8:05 p.m. ``Brown really helped them off the bench,
and King hit some big shots at the end. They kept us on our
heels.''
</P>
<P>
   And now?
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll just wait and see what happens with the appeal
process,'' Dickey said, ``but I would say it's not good.''

AS JIMMY FADES, JAGS BURST FORTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ It was stunning. It was brutal. And for
Jimmy Johnson, it was a coaching career 180 degrees from his glory
days with the Cowboys. This time, a dazed Jimster was on the
stunned and brutalized end of a playoff nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Put-it-in-three-inch-headlines seemed so long ago and far away.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, a mere three inches of headline would not properly
explain what 62-7 was all about. But the expected repercussions
just might. A multitude of NFL timelines could follow immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning of an era: If the Jacksonville Jaguars are really this
good, then the Lombardi Trophy arrives here in two weeks, and might
stay awhile. Before yesterday, the Jaguars were generally regarded
as a soft No. 1 seed in the AFC playoff bracket. From ``soft'' to
62-7 playoff winners is a gigantic leap over NFL mankind.
</P>
<P>
   End of an era, Part I: Johnson's coaching career is expected to
give way to a beach in the Florida Keys. Jimmy meets today with
Dolphins owner Wayne Huizenga. The only question seems to be if
this retirement will be voluntary. Huizenga, by the way, departed
yesterday's game early in the second half, apparently in disgust.
</P>
<P>
   End of an era, Part II: It was a trying season for future Hall
of Fame quarterback Dan Marino. But at no time has he appeared as
old, tired and worn out as yesterday. Unlike Johnson, however,
Marino can't seem to take a hint. Even a 62-7 hint. ``I still feel
I can win games in this league,'' he said, after throwing two
interceptions and losing a fumble, all in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   For what it's worth, 62-7 also benefited the Cowboys from the
standpoint of who might be coming and going in Miami. Legitimate
head coaching candidates for Jerry Jones' new vacancy have been
hard to come by.
</P>
<P>
   But Dolphins assistant head coach Dave Wannstedt, a longtime
Jones favorite, indicated after the game he was interested. Word
from Miami earlier in the week had said otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to talk to Jerry,'' Wannstedt said. ``Everyone knows
how I feel about that area and about that team.''
</P>
<P>
   Wannstedt was the Cowboys' defensive coordinator at the start of
the dynasty era, moved to the Bears as head coach for six seasons,
and was hired by Johnson early last year to be his No. 1 assistant
and possible replacement as head coach.
</P>
<P>
   But Wannstedt's contract in Miami was for only this season,
which was at his request to keep options open for another head
coaching job. If Johnson retires, Huizenga might choose to go with
an entire new staff, particularly after 62-7.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had any offensive-coordinator candidates in mind for
the Cowboys, Wannstedt answered, ``I sure do.'' But he also said
he'd had no contact this week from anyone with the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, based on yesterday, the Cowboys could use any member
of the Jaguars' offensive staff.
</P>
<P>
   Marino's horrible day can explain Miami's not being competitive
on one side of the ball. But the Dolphins' once-proud defense was
steam-rolled by Jacksonville, which already had put up 31 points by
one play into the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Blame me, was the Jimmy explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened today was because of poor judgment on my part,''
he said. ``I should have given the players an easy week of
practice. Instead, we worked hard, really had good practices, but
we left it all on the practice field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of me, we were dead-legged right from the start. I
give full credit to Jacksonville, but we weren't fresh out there,
and I'm to blame for that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins opened the first round of the playoffs a week ago
with a 6,000-mile round trip to Seattle. After that victory, the
turnaround was quick, playing the first game of the second round
here yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson also had preached his usual ``keep it conservative
and turnover free'' sermon for Jacksonville. Even as an 8 1/2-point
underdog, the Dolphins were given a good chance for the upset.
Jacksonville was a 14-game winner in the regular season but had
defeated no team with a winning record and lost twice to Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   When Jacksonville drove for a touchdown after taking the opening
kickoff, the blowout was about to begin. Marino then threw a
mindless interception on his first possession, resulting in a
Jaguars' field goal. Marino followed that by having the ball
knocked loose, and Jacksonville defensive end Tony Brackens scored
on the fumble he caused.
</P>
<P>
   It was quickly 17-0, and much worse for the Dolphins would
follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been on this side of it before,'' said Johnson, who
quickly bolted the postgame interview room without taking a
question.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Jimmy didn't want to be asked about his football
future. After 62-7, there doesn't appear to be one.

ABC DISPUTES DRUG OFFICE CLAIMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients, also moved on the ``a''
national and ``n'' California news wires.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES, Calif. -- ABC executives said Saturday the White
House drug policy office asked for scripts of TV shows before they
were aired as part of its program content-for-advertising swap,
directly contradicting what the White House office said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Fili-Krushel, president of ABC, said it is likely the
Office of National Drug Control Policy made the same script request
of other networks.
</P>
<P>
   The statements are the latest twist to a controversy that
erupted Thursday over the networks' apparent use of program content
in a financial bargain with the government.
</P>
<P>
   Fili-Krushel's disclosure suggests that the drug czar's office
has been trying to influence the content of TV shows, not merely
with input from experts, but as a condition for monetary credit
with the networks.
</P>
<P>
   Fili-Krushel said ABC had been sending tapes of already-aired
programs -- ``The Practice,'' ``Home Improvement'' and ``General
Hospital,'' among others -- to the ONDCP, which concluded the
shows' content fulfilled at least part of a contract granting the
ONDCP free air time, or public service announcements, for anti-drug
messages.
</P>
<P>
   However, Alan Levitt, the administrator of the ONDCP's
controversial arrangement with the networks, met with ABC
salespeople last spring and asked the network for advance scripts
instead of aired tapes in order to grant credit, ABC executives
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (the ONDCP) told us they were changing the requirements,
that we had to submit scripts ahead of time in order to qualify for
programming content (credit),'' Fili-Krushel told reporters at the
Television Critics' Association meeting in Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Wallau, ABC's president of administration and operations,
said the request was raised by Levitt.
</P>
<P>
   While there was no explicit demand for script approval or input
-- the conversation didn't get that far, he said -- it is difficult
to imagine any other reason why the ONDCP would insist on seeing
scripts instead of tapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said we're not going to do that, and that was the end of
discussions,'' Wallau said.
</P>
<P>
   The ONDCP issued a statement Saturday saying it never suggested
changes in scripts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indeed, we have always assumed that any transcripts or
programs submitted for public service value qualification were
final products and not subject to further change,'' the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the script request, ABC stopped submitting
program content for possible fulfillment of its PSA obligation to
the drug czar's office beginning last fall, instead meeting its
requirement with free commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's disclosure contradicts statements made Friday to the
critics' group by Donald R. Vereen, ONDCP's deputy director.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't approve scripts. We don't alter them. We don't ask
for them,'' Vereen said. ``They're sent to us voluntarily, often
after they're totally completed or have already aired.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallau said the proposal written by the ONDCP and its ad agency,
Ogilvy &AMP; Mather, for the 1999-2000 season does not specify ``as
strongly as it was specified in the meeting as to the desire for
scripts in advance,'' according to his sales staff.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of an investigative story broken this week by online
magazine Salon.com and other reports, the drug office seems to be
backing down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agency, Ogilvy &AMP; Mather, called us (Friday) and said, `If
you want to submit (tapes) after the fact for a programming match,
you may,''' Wallau said. ``We said we'll pass, we'll just stay with
our PSA match.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all the broadcast networks said last week that they have
not submitted scripts to the ONDCP for an advertising exchange. WB
did alter episodes of its series ``The Wayans Bros.'' and ``Smart
Guy'' in response to ONDCP input, apparently for program content
credit, according to the Salon.com report.
</P>
<P>
   ABC also contradicted suppositions that it profited from the
arrangement. ``We lost money on this deal,'' Wallau said.
</P>
<P>
   Fili-Krushel said in the 1997-98 season, the network aired $45
million in paid spots for the ONDCP. In the second year it aired a
projected $45 million worth of free PSAs.
</P>
<P>
   The PSA schedule, analyzed after the fact against ratings
reports, under-delivered air time by about $5 million, so the
network submitted tapes of some of its shows dealing with the
subject, estimating the combined programs were worth $105 million.
The ONDCP agreed the contract had been fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   While ABC did not come out ahead, it saved $5 million in
additional spots it would have had to give the drug policy office.

critics' group by Donald R. Vereen, ONDCP's deputy director.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't approve scripts. We don't alter them. We don't ask
for them,'' Vereen said. ``They're sent to us voluntarily, often
after they're totally completed or have already aired.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallau said the proposal written by the ONDCP and its ad agency,
Ogilvy &AMP; Mather, for the 1999-2000 season does not specify ``as
strongly as it was specified in the meeting as to the desire for
scripts in advance,'' according to his sales staff.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of an investigative story broken this week by online
magazine Salon.com and other reports, the drug office seems to be
backing down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agency, Ogilvy &AMP; Mather, called us (Friday) and said, `If
you want to submit (tapes) after the fact for a programming match,
you may,''' Wallau said. ``We said we'll pass, we'll just stay with
our PSA match.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all the broadcast networks said last week that they have
not submitted scripts to the ONDCP for an advertising exchange. WB
did alter episodes of its series ``The Wayans Bros.'' and ``Smart
Guy'' in response to ONDCP input, apparently for program content
credit, according to the Salon.com report.
</P>
<P>
   ABC also contradicted suppositions that it profited from the
arrangement. ``We lost money on this deal,'' Wallau said.
</P>
<P>
   Fili-Krushel said in the 1997-98 season, the network aired $45
million in paid spots for the ONDCP. In the second year it aired a
projected $45 million worth of free PSAs.
</P>
<P>
   The PSA schedule, analyzed after the fact against ratings
reports, under-delivered air time by about $5 million, so the
network submitted tapes of some of its shows dealing with the
subject, estimating the combined programs were worth $105 million.
The ONDCP agreed the contract had been fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   While ABC did not come out ahead, it saved $5 million in
additional spots it would have had to give the drug policy office.

LAKERS DEFEAT WOLVES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS -- The Lakers ended an intimate relationship this
week end, and as with anyone in a transitional phase, a wardrobe
change was in order. Their accessory of choice Saturday should have
been the hard-hat.
</P>
<P>
   The first day of the rest of their lives, following the end of
their am azing 16-game winning streak, included a date with the
equally hot Minnesota Timberwolves. And it took a grind-it-out,
workmanlike effort to restore their winning ways, which they did
with a 104-91 victory at Target Center.
</P>
<P>
   After losing at Indiana on Friday with a flurry of late miscues,
the La kers dominated the final minutes against Minnesota, holding
the Timberwolves to 11 points in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   A bounce-back from the emotional low of seeing their streak
snapped? Yes. But coach Phil Jackson said the victory was all about
playing steady.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't get emotional,'' he said. ``It was just a
take-care-of-business type of game. This was a game in which we had
to go out and prove to ourselves that we're going to take care of
business and not get flustered if they have a run, and not get
taken out of the control phase of ou r game. And we did a good
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Kobe Bryant put it, ``We just didn't want to lose two in
a row. We wanted to nip it in the bud. We lost one, big deal --
come out, win, get back on the right track again.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal, fighting off fatigue and a slight shooting
slump, led the way Saturday with a game-high 26 points on 11-of-20
shooting and added 19 rebounds, seven assists and five blocked
shots.
</P>
<P>
   But it was what he did in in the fourth quarter that made the
difference -- scoring eight points on 4-of-7 shooting and making a
defensive stan d when the Lakers desperately needed to put the
Timberwolves away.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal admitted to being tired on the three-game road trip, but
Jackson kept him fresh for the finish, using John Salley to spell
him in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``My legs was tired,'' O'Neal said. ``I asked him for that rest,
and he gave me a couple minutes. Salley came in and did a pretty
good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Like O'Neal, Bryant again struggled with his shot, scoring 22
points on 8-of-18 shooting. Glen Rice added 17 points, and Derek
Fisher scored 14 .
</P>
<P>
   After trailing by as many as 17 points in the first half, the
Timberwolves used a 31-23 third quarter to forge an 80-80 tie
heading into the final period. Kevin Garnett and Terrell Brandon
scored 11 points each in the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we were energy-short there in the second period, and
we came out and struggled in that third quarter,'' Jackson said.
``They did a nice job of getting the game back by putting (Joe)
Smith on Shaq and creating a situation inside, getting 31 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt confident that we still had the game controlled at
some level in the fourth quarter. Defensively, we got ourselves
together. Derek did a nice job on Brandon and we were able to hit
some outside shots.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be Fisher again. He hit four 3-pointers in the fourth
to score 12 of his 14 points while managing to contain the speedy
Brandon.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers scored the first nine points of the quarter, and when
Fisher hit from 26 feet out for his third 3-pointer, the cushion
was back to 15 points, 97-82, with less than five minutes
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he took it personally that his guy wasn't even
checking him,' ' O'Neal said of Fisher, who was left open when
Brandon double-teamed the post.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get offended or anything like that when people do
that,'' Fisher said. ``I just wanted to come back in and be
aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Lakers fell short of a 3-0 road trip, and returned home
early this morning without a truncated winning streak, but retain
the best record in the NBA at 32-6.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just wanted to come in, punch the clock, go home to L.A.
and play in Staples Center again,'' Bryant said. ``We miss our
home. That's our castle.''
</P>

FINLEY STATES CASE TO PIPPEN AS MAVERICKS BEAT BLAZERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ARTHUR GARCIA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Maybe it's time Scottie Pippen reconsiders his stance
on Michel Finley.
</P>
<P>
   Finley, who Pippen said last week doesn't deserve All-Star
consideration, admitted he had a point to prove in the Mavericks'
113-105 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers at Reunion Arena
last night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gave me a little incentive,'' Finley said. ``I wanted to
prove not only to him, but around the league that I deserve to be
on the All-Star team.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley's 32 points and Hubert Davis' three fourth-period
3-pointers enabled the Mavericks (12-24) to hold off the
fast-charging Blazers before the Mavericks' first home sellout
(18,148) of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hubert made some big 3-pointers, and he and Mike took over in
the fourth,'' Mavericks coach Don Nelson said after the team's
second consecutive victory.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson also had plenty to say about Pippen's comments regarding
Finley, the NBA's 12th-leading scorer at 22.6 points per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scottie has a lot to say about a lot of things,'' said Nelson,
who moved within two victories of 900 in his career. ``That's his
prerogative. I've said all year that Mike is an All-Star.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the first negative I've heard about Finley from another
player. If \RFinley\S had something to prove tonight, I think he
proved it.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley, who said he is friends with Pippen and the two work out
together in the summer, said Pippen's opinion may stem from sour
grapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scottie is basically an All-Star not having an All-Star
season,'' said Finley, who was 13-of-25 from the field, including
2-of-4 on 3-pointers. ``And I'm somebody that can take his spot
\Ron the All-Star team\S.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen scored a Blazers-high 22 points and remained unconvinced
of Finley's All-Star credentials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be difficult to make the All-Star team off a bad team,''
he said. ``It's a true fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley's last 3-pointer, a 26-footer, pushed the Mavericks lead
to 102-96 with 3:49 left. Portland point guard Damon Stoudamire had
just cut the Mavericks lead to three points moments earlier with a
3-point play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew they were going to make a run,'' said Mavericks
forward Cedric Ceballos, who scored 17 points. ``They have depth
and a lot of weapons. It was great for us to hold our composure and
match their intensity.''
</P>
<P>
   Portland (28-9) pulled with 107-105 with less than a minute to
play, but the Mavericks made six of their last seven foul shots to
secure the victory. The victory snapped the Blazers' eight-game
winning streak against the Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks led from late in the first period to the end, but
had to fight off several Portland runs. The Blazers, who played the
night before in Phoenix, looked sluggish in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key was getting on them early, especially with them coming
off a back-to-back,'' Mavericks guard Erick Strickland said.
</P>
<P>
   Strickland helped keep the Blazers at bay when the visitors made
a charge early in the third period. Rasheed Wallace's jumper pulled
Portland within 70-58 _ the closest the Blazers had been since
midway through the second period. Strickland answered with a
3-pointer, a free throw off Wallace's second technical foul and
another three-pointer. Wallace was ejected in the third quarter
after being called twice for technical fouls.
</P>
<P>
   Strickland's spurt was sandwiched around two Pippen foul shots
and pushed the Mavericks back up to 15 (77-62). Strickland would
score 11 of the team's last 13 points in the third, as the
Mavericks went into the final period up 83-71.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks jumped out to a 10-point lead (22-12) late in the
first period and watched the advantage grow for the rest of the
first half. Finley sliced through the Blazers for 17 first-half
points and the Mavericks shot 52.1 percent over the opening 24
minutes. The 18-point lead at the half (61-43) was the Mavericks'
second-largest at the break this season.

PHILLS TRAGEDY SHOWS WHAT IS WRONG WITH SPORTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DON BOWMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The death of Charlotte Hornets basketball player Bobby Phills on
Wednesday was a terrible, tragic waste.
</P>
<P>
   It also pointed out all that is wrong with athletics today.
</P>
<P>
   Phills, by all reports, was a giving, community-minded player
who definitely did not fit in with the current profile of many
``thug'' athletes.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday, according to police statements, Phills and
teammate David Wesley decided to drag-race their Porsches,
resulting in the fatal crash. On a dangerous road with a 45-mph
speed limit, Phills, going more than 75, lost control and slid into
oncoming traffic. He was pronounced dead at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   The Hornets were given permission by the NBA to postpone their
next two games and will wear armbands to honor Phills for the rest
of the season. And that's all justifiable and good.
</P>
<P>
   But the team went a step too far. Phills' number is going to be
retired Feb. 9, becoming the first player to have his number
retired in the team's 11-year history.
</P>
<P>
   That's wrong.
</P>
<P>
   As good a person as Phills seems to be, he has been given a
special honor _ special consideration _ because he is an athlete.
And while his death is a tragic waste, he doesn't deserve that.
</P>
<P>
   Two other people were injured in the accident. ``They'' could
have been killed instead of Phills. And if they had, would the
Hornets still be retiring his number? Do you think the families of
those two people will be cheering Phills' induction into Hornets
history?
</P>
<P>
   The way athletes are perceived by the American public _ and
justice system _ sometimes boggles the mind.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Muhammad's wife dies in childbirth, and his teammates talk
about how difficult it is for Muhammad. Meanwhile, he's being
investigated by the police and is facing misdemeanor battery
charges after allegedly roughing up her and her 6-year-old son a
few days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad is still playing. His wife's father has publicly asked
how the Colts could give tougher punishments to players for use of
marijuana than domestic violence. There was a report Muhammad was
fined $10,000 at one point, but the Colts have denied that.
</P>
<P>
   Rae Carruth's pregnant girlfriend is gunned down and killed, and
his teammates talk about how difficult it must be for poor Rae,
who, by the way, refused to talk to the police on the day it
happened. Now he's on trial for murder, facing the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Athletes, above everything else, are people, not gods. There are
a tremendous number of them who contribute greatly to society. Troy
Aikman and Emmitt Smith of the Cowboys give back a great deal to
the community. Royce Clayton and Rusty Greer of the Rangers are
also very involved in local causes. The Cardinals' Mark McGwire is
actively involved financially and emotionally in trying to help
battered children.
</P>
<P>
   But there are many athletes who have been brought up believing
they're something special _ and have gotten away with things the
normal person couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Phills was ``not'' an antisocial, lawbreaking person,
although he reportedly had several other speeding violations. His
death was a tragedy. In fact, I have a feeling he would be appalled
that his number is being retired after his death, considering how
it occurred.
</P>
<P>
   And by retiring it, the Hornets are sending a bad message _ and
compounding the tragedy more.

CARLTON FISK A RARE FIND IN COOPERSTOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Carlton Fisk will join an elite group this summer. The few, the
proud, the Hall of Fame catchers.
</P>
<P>
   Hall voters, including members of the Baseball Writers
Association of America as well as the Veteran's Committee, had
elected 180 major-leaguers before this year. The number included 58
pitchers, 54 outfielders (18 left fielders, 16 center fielders and
20 right fielders,) 24 corner infielders, although only nine third
basemen, 19 shortstops and 14 second basemen.
</P>
<P>
   And only 11 catchers.
</P>
<P>
   Why the prejudice against backstops?
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe because it's been referred to as the player wearing the
tools of ignorance,'' said the man who'll make it a dozen when he
goes in this July. ``A lot of players, a lot of writers, a lot of
fans don't truly know what it takes to catch every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Who, indeed, can know what it takes to squat behind the plate
for nine innings? Or what it does to the knees? Or the toll it
takes, physically and mentally? Who can know what it takes to go
through all that and then also contribute with the bat?
</P>
<P>
   ``Catching is such a unique position,'' said Fisk, who did more
of it than anyone who ever played the game. ``Sometimes lost in the
translation is just how difficult catching is. As a result, some of
what you do gets lost in the shuffle.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, what generally gets lost is a catcher's ability to
swing the bat.
</P>
<P>
   Hall of Fame voters, and baseball fans in general, can
appreciate the defensive attributes of catchers. They can
appreciate Bob Boone's seven Gold Gloves and the six consecutive
Gold Gloves won by former Ranger Jim Sundberg from 1976 to 1981.
</P>
<P>
   But they also realize few catchers have Hall of Fame offensive
credentials.
</P>
<P>
   Boone threw out more than 45 percent of runners attempting to
steal with California in 1982-88, including 58 percent his first
year with the Angels. But he was a career .254 hitter with
single-season highs of 12 homers and 66 RBI. He dropped off the
ballot this year when he didn't get the required five percent.
</P>
<P>
   Sundberg dominated the American League defensively for several
seasons, but he was a .248 career hitter with single-season highs
of 12 homers and 65 RBI. His one and only year on the ballot was
1995, when he got one vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Catching is so different than any other position on the
field,'' Fisk said. ``A lot of people can catch a little bit, be
platooned a little bit, but to catch a lot and be part of both ends
of the game, I don't think a lot can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   If Hall of Fame voters are guilty of anything when it comes to
catchers, it's not asking the question of whether they dominated
their position offensively and defensively for a number of years.
</P>
<P>
   Using that criteria, 11-time All-Star Gary Carter would make it.
Instead, he was a badly beaten also ran on the ballot. Lance
Parrish also would have to be considered when he makes it on to the
ballot in a couple of years. Instead, he's not likely to get much
attention.
</P>
<P>
   So until Ivan Rodriguez _ assuming he stays on his current
career track _ and Mike Piazza _ assuming he doesn't switch to
first base and play the bulk of his games there _ retire, the
small, elite group of Hall of Fame catchers isn't likely to grow
anytime soon. Cap question The question of which cap Fisk would
wear on his Hall of Fame plaque came down to which team smoothed
over hard feelings from his playing days.
</P>
<P>
   Fisk came up with the Red Sox and played in Boston for 11 years,
but departed under a cloud of bitterness after the 1980 season when
he became a free agent because the club missed the deadline for
mailing him a contract.
</P>
<P>
   He moved on to Chicago, where he played 13 seasons for the White
Sox. But he became upset when he was released in 1993 at age 44 and
wasn't allowed into the clubhouse to mingle with his former
teammates during the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The bitterness toward the Red Sox largely is gone; Fisk is
employed as a special assistant to Boston general manager Dan
Duquette. The hard feelings toward the White Sox remain.
</P>
<P>
   So, despite playing more seasons in Chicago, Fisk is going in
with a Red Sox cap. Staying or going? The Ken Griffey trade talks
are alive and well. Or they're dead in the water.
</P>
<P>
   It's certain that if Griffey is dealt, he's going to Cincinnati.
The superstar center fielder has made it clear he'll exercise his
veto power if the Mariners trade him to any team other than the
Reds.
</P>
<P>
   Trade talks fell apart during the winter meetings when the Reds
refused to include second baseman Pokey Reese in any package. No
deal, Cincinnati general manager Jim Bowden announced. Nothing
further to talk about.
</P>
<P>
   And now?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a deal issue to me,'' Mariners GM Pat Gillick said.
He said he hasn't talked to Bowden but ``our organization has.''
</P>
<P>
   So the talks are alive, right? Not necessarily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing has changed,'' Bowden said. ``We have not reopened any
discussions with them.'' Role model? Long-distance carrier IDT
Corp. is interested in entering into a long-term endorsement
agreement with Pete Rose. The company reportedly wants to build the
campaign around the parallels between the hit king's determination
to overcome his ban from baseball for gambling and IDT's goal to
gain a market share against established phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think of ourselves as a company that really hustles, and he
was the most hustling player there was,'' said Howard Jones, IDT's
founder, chairman and CEO.
</P>
<P>
   Rose was a great ballplayer who might have got more out of
limited talent than anyone who ever played the game. It can be
argued that his sins weren't any greater than the many who have
besmirched the game by abusing drugs, alcohol or wives.
</P>
<P>
   But Rose also is an unrepentant, compulsive gambler and doesn't
deserve to be pitching anyone's product. Wrong remedy You don't
have to be a politically correct, left-wing idiot to realize that
Braves reliever John Rocker was wrong to make his bigoted remarks.
But ``off his Rocker'' is just a cute line, not a diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   Various hates and prejudices ultimately are a moral decision,
not a matter of mental defect. If baseball thinks that being
ostracized by fans and having to deal with his own teammates isn't
punishment enough, it should come up with a remedy other than
psychiatric testing. ] Keeping up with the Joneses The Mets
cornered the market on pitchers named Bobby Jones when they traded
Masato Yoshii to the Rockies for left-hander Bobby M. Jones. They
already had right-hander Bobby J. Jones, a right-hander.
</P>
<P>
   The two Joneses made a little bit of baseball history when they
started against each other on May 11. It was the first time
starting pitchers with the same name faced each other since April
16, 1899, when Cincinnati's John B. Taylor met Chicago's John W.
Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   It's the second time the Mets have had pitchers with the same
name. In 1962, Robert L. Miller and Robert G. Miller pitched for
the team. Hot stove embers If the Rockies pitching doesn't improve,
it won't be because of lack of effort by GM Dan O'Dowd. He's added
Masato Yoshii, Rolando Arrojo, Julian Tavarez, Mike Myers, Jose
Jimenez, Manny Aybar and Rick Croushore this off-season.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Trachsel's one year, $1 million deal with Tampa Bay could
be worth as much as $4.5 million if he meets all his performance
bonuses. Even so, it could be a bargain for the Devil Rays.
Trachsel lost 18 games last year, but he's one of only eight
pitchers to make 30 or more starts and pitch 200 or more innings in
each of the last four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   White Sox shortstop Mike Caruso looked like a future star when
he batted .306 as a rookie in 1998. But after hitting .250 with
more errors _ 24 _ than extra-base hits _ 17 _ last season, he's
about to lose his job to the erratic Jose Valentin.

SNUBBED BELFOUR VICTIM OF ALL-STAR SCAM
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the wild, wacky world of trying to make the game of hockey
more appealing to the TV-viewing masses, the NHL has taken the
unprecedented move of ``not'' sending their best players to the
All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   No, it's not a typo.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Gary Bettman's politically correct All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   They want the biggest name players, i.e. Vancouver's Mark
Messier despite a less-than-spectacular season. They want a player
from every franchise, i.e. Atlanta's Petr Buzek, despite being a
healthy scratch only a couple of games before selections were
announced. They want the players fans vote for, i.e. Buffalo's
Dominik Hasek despite missing most of this season with a groin
injury.
</P>
<P>
   They're the players want even if they aren't the best players.
</P>
<P>
   And that is the quick and dirty version of why Stars goalie Ed
Belfour isn't an All-Star despite having an All-Star season.
</P>
<P>
   ``As good as \RBelfour\S was last year, he's been even better
this year,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said on the day the
selections were announced.
</P>
<P>
   He wouldn't say it, but without Belfour, the injuries that
plagued the Stars at the beginning of the season likely would've
buried them. Consider, too, on selection day the Stars were coming
off back-to-back games where they allowed 80 shots yet escaped with
three out of a possible four points, and you can see why Hitchcock
would say that the goalies have been the Stars' best players.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour, for his part, wasn't saying much of anything.
</P>
<P>
   What can you do? Etc., etc., blah, blah, blah ...
</P>
<P>
   He understands the way the system works. He got caught in a
numbers game, and not the right numbers, either. In the end, it
didn't matter that his goals-against average (2.21) going into last
night's game was significantly lower than one of the two at-large
selections, New York Rangers goalie Mike Richter (2.69).
</P>
<P>
   What mattered was the NHL needed a player from the Rangers. They
felt like they had to honor a team that had underachieved with the
largest payroll in the league. Why? Who knows.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, Belfour wasn't alone.
</P>
<P>
   Former Stars and now St. Louis Blues goalie Roman Turek took it
on the chin, too. He has the best goals-against averages in the
league at 2.05, yet he was bypassed for Washington's Olaf Kolzig
and his 2.51 goals-against average. Why? You guessed it. They
needed a Capitals presence on the team to pull in the Washington
market.
</P>
<P>
   Does anybody really believe that Kolzig is going to help the NHL
pull a 20-share in the nation's capital? Or Richter for New York?
</P>
<P>
   Uh, let's hope not.
</P>
<P>
   So, here's an idea: Have one player from every team represented
in the Skills Competition on Saturday. Have the best players play
in the All-Star Game on Sunday. Get it? Stars of league play in
All-Star game.
</P>
<P>
   No fan voting. No sending big-name players just for the sake of
their big names. No Colin Cambell in conjunction with general
managers doing the selecting.
</P>
<P>
   Have the players vote instead. They know better than anybody
who's having a good season. They know better than anybody who's
hard to play against. They know better than anybody who deserves to
go.
</P>
<P>
   And you bet, they would've known to put Belfour and Turek in.
Spotlight
Oilers' Marchant eager to continue what he started
Stars fans have an enduring, albeit frustrating, image of Edmonton
Oilers forward Todd Marchant.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Cup playoffs. First round. Stars vs. Oilers. Game 7.
Overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Marchant, in a single motion, ended Dallas' 1997 season a couple
of rounds sooner than expected, silenced a frenzied crowd and
forever burned an image into Stars' fans minds when he scored on
Stars goalie Andy Moog.
</P>
<P>
   A Stanley Cup and 33 months later, Stars fans will be happy to
know that Marchant still ranks that game-winning goal as his
biggest moment in hockey. The image is still burned in his mind,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what every player or kid dreams of doing, aside from
wining a Stanley Cup,'' Marchant said. ``When you are out playing
on the pond or in the backyard or out in the street, you are always
talking about situations and it is always the Stanley Cup playoffs,
Game 7 in overtime. So to actually go out and doing something like
that reaffirms all those dreams you had as a kid. It's a dream that
came true.''
</P>
<P>
   His goal didn't just win a game either. It started a rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since that goal, Stars and Oilers has become one of the
best rivalries in the Western Conference. That the two teams have
met in the playoffs for three consecutive seasons has also helped
the rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   Could another playoff meeting be on the horizon?
</P>
<P>
   No, not with the way the Oilers began the season. Yes, with the
way they have been playing lately. And Marchant said he would like
nothing more than to play the Stars again if the Oilers qualify.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it's in the Western Conference finals,'' Marchant said.
</P>
<P>
   And does he imagine himself scoring another such goal?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a moment in time that kind of came out and that you are
being associated with,'' Marchant said. ``You bet I want to do it
again.''
Around the East Finding an apartment in New York? Hard.
</P>
<P>
   Finding one in a New York Islanders-approved way? Impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Islanders general manager Mike Milbury ripped his young
goaltender Roberto Luongo for his apartment-hunting on game day.
The 7-3 loss to the Boston Bruins that night added to Milbury's
anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kid was out looking at apartments the whole day,'' Milbury
said. ``Hel-lo? You can't do that in the NHL and show up for the
game. I love his composure and confidence, but this is not Val D'Or
\RLuongo's junior team\S. This is the NHL. You've got to prepare
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Luongo, meanwhile, said he went to one apartment and followed
his usual game-day routine from there.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh Penguins coach Herb Brooks took the label ``players'
coach'' to the limit.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, he confronted and shoved a Colorado Avalanche
broadcaster for accusing Penguins left winger Matthew Barnaby of
faking an injury. The confrontation made the 5 o'clock news just
about everywhere, and the NHL has suspended Brooks pending a
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Barnaby, for one, was pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect that,'' Barnaby said. ``He's standing up for our
team, and we've got to stand up for him. As a player, it's really
nice to know that your coach goes to bat for you.''
Around the West Maybe goalie Nikolai Khabibulin isn't going to play
for the Phoenix Coyotes this season after all.
</P>
<P>
   Stuck in the fourth month of a holdout from the Coyotes,
Khabibulin signed with the Long Beach Ice Dogs of the International
Hockey League. The minor-league contract leaves room for him to
return to the NHL, but also shows he isn't afraid to miss this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Khabibulin and the Coyotes are reportedly $2 million apart. The
27-year-old goalie wants $5 million a season, and the Coyotes are
offering $3 million. Khabibulin requested a trade in November, but
the Coyotes have said they have no plans to deal or sign him. They
acquired veteran goalie Sean Burke from the Florida Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   Calgary Flames defenseman Steve Smith had no feeling in his legs
and arms as he lay on the ice. He had collided with teammate Bobby
Dollas, causing his neck to snap forward and then back.
</P>
<P>
   As he lay there, he said he felt fear.
</P>
<P>
   So when the doctors removed a neck brace in a couple of weeks,
he says he'll begin to contemplate whether he'll retire. He's 36
and has been inundated with injuries the past couple of seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is up and around, and that's good to see,'' Flames general
manager Al Coates said. ``But we have that two-week window until we
have to reassess where he is.''

PHILLS' LIFE WAS ABOUT MORE THAN BASKETBALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everybody should be so fortunate to have a person like Bobby
Phills in their family.
</P>
<P>
   If every sports franchise was stocked with a Bobby Phills, there
would be no talk of surly attitudes, back talk, trash-talking or
locker-room lawyers. Phills was the epitome of what NBA
commissioner David Stern would like all of his players to be.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Phills' death has been so difficult for players,
coaches and NBA employees to accept. The Charlotte Hornets guard,
who was killed in a car crash Wednesday, was a class act.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was an absolutely great, great person, someone I'm
genuinely proud to say has been a very good friend of mine for
several years,'' said Golden State forward Chris Mills, who used to
play in Cleveland with Phills. ``He's the type of person who would
do anything to help a teammate, friend or stranger.
</P>
<P>
   ``That makes this tragedy very hard to accept or understand. I
was in complete shock, and now several hours later, I don't want to
believe it happened, especially to someone with as much class and
dignity as Bobby Phills.''
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment was echoed throughout the NBA, as everyone
mourned the loss of a man who was involved in community projects in
Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Phills' heroics extended off the court. He tried to save a
Charlotte man who caught on fire while riding a motorcycle. Phills
was playing golf nearby, and helped extinguish the flames.
</P>
<P>
   The man eventually died, but his family credited Phills with
giving them a chance to say goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many pro athletes, Phills was grounded, self-assured and
didn't need sports to validate his life.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Fratello, who coached Phills during his first NBA season
(1992-'93), remembers telling Phills he probably didn't have room
for him because the team had 13 guaranteed contracts. Fratello told
Phills to go home and talk it over with his agent.
</P>
<P>
   Some 24 hours later, Phills returned and told Fratello: ``I want
to stick it out here. You're stuck with me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Understand something,'' Fratello said. ``He was prepared to be
cut. So many kids wouldn't be able to handle being waived.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Bobby thought enough of himself, he was confident enough
in his heart, that if he was out in the street, he would have
succeeded in anything. He was going to be a vet, he was going to be
a doctor. He could have done anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Phills' dad, Dr. Bobby Phills, is the dean of agriculture and
home economics at Florida A&AMP;M. He taught his son well.
</P>
<P>
   ``As athletes, you learn that mortality is not promised,'' said
Seattle's Chuck Person, who played in Charlotte with Phills. ``When
something like this happens to our fraternity brothers, it hits
home and puts things in perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Phills will be buried today in Baton Rouge, La. During a
memorial service Friday in Charlotte, Phills' 3-year old son, Bobby
Ray III, said it best: ``Daddy is in heaven with the angels.''
\Nsubheds:AROUND THE EAST \Nagatea:Orlando Magic coach Doc Rivers
can appreciate the aggressive attitude Toronto Raptors forward
Charles Oakley brings to the court.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Rivers saw Oakley's value up close when they were
teammates on the New York Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the best teammates I ever had,'' Rivers said. ``I
really didn't care for him until I got to New York and saw how
valuable he was. As an opponent, you just thought he was a guy who
would cheap-shot you, but he did it with a purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to cheap-shot his own teammates in practice. He did it
to get people ready to play. They love him in Toronto. With him
around, that's why you don't see anyone undercutting Vince Carter.
It won't happen with Charles around.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Indiana Pacers have broken the Los Angeles Lakers'
16-game winning streak, the Pacers have emerged as favorites to win
the East.
</P>
<P>
   In successive games, the Detroit Pistons' Grant Hill scored 42,
42, 31 and 40 points and was selected NBA Player of the Week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep saying we've got the best player in the NBA,'' Pistons
coach Alvin Gentry said. ``Or the best non-center in the NBA for
sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Toronto guard Vince Carter said it didn't bother him that the
Milwaukee Bucks' Ray Allen received the final 2000 Olympic guard
spot over him last week.
</P>
<P>
   But the first chance Carter got to show the USA Basketball
committee that they made a mistake, he scored a franchise-high 47
points as the Raptors beat Allen and the Bucks, 115-110, Friday.
</P>
<P>
   \Nsubheds:AROUND THE WEST \Nagatea:Maybe coaching does have
something to do with a team's success.
</P>
<P>
   The Vancouver Grizzlies, a team given up for dead under coach
Brian Hill, have been revitalized under Lionel Hollins. The
Grizzlies completed a 4-1 East Coast road trip that included
victories over Miami, New Jersey, Toronto and Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at what we were a couple of weeks ago, yes, it is
an outstanding road trip,'' said Hollins, who replaced Hill on Dec.
16. ``I don't know if it's the best in NBA history, but it's the
best in the Grizzlies' history and that's all I care about.''
</P>
<P>
   With lots of free time, former Golden State Warriors coach P.J.
Carlesimo has become engaged to girlfriend Caroline Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota Timberwolves forward Wally Szczerbiak is back in the
lineup, and the Timberwovles can thank Lisa Giannone for the
assist.
</P>
<P>
   Giannone is a physical therapist in the San Francisco area who
gained recognition for her work in 1997 with San Francisco 49ers
wide receiver Jerry Rice. Szczerbiak, who was activated from the
injured list Tuesday, recently worked with Giannone in the Bay
Area, then followed the rehabilitation program she prescribed.
</P>
<P>
   Szczerbiak strengthened the muscles around his sore kneecap,
letting them handle more of the load in running and cutting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels 10 times better,'' he said. ``No pain at all.''
</P>
<P>
   \Nsubheds:SPOTLIGHT ON ... Elliott planning return to Spurs by
next month San Antonio Spurs forward Sean Elliott is eager to get
back on the basketball court.
</P>
<P>
   And the Spurs are eager to have him back.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs have been unable to fill his slot, which is why the
defending NBA champions have struggled at times this season.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott recently spent four days in a hospital because of the
flu. But doctors said it was unrelated to the kidney transplant he
had Aug. 16, which has kept him out of action this season.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott would like to start practicing with the Spurs in two
weeks, with his eye on returning near the end of February.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to be a situation of, `Can I?' '' Elliott said.
``It's, `I'm going to.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott did not participate in any basketball-related activities
from Dec. 7 to Jan. 2. However, he resumed running this past week
and has been overly pleased with his progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been night and day,'' Elliott said after one run.
</P>
<P>
   Nine days ago, Elliott scrimmaged with Derrick Dial and Felton
Spencer, but didn't last long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't play that long because it didn't take long for me to
hit the wall,'' Elliott said. ``And I hit it head-on.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott said he has been cleared by his doctors for ``friendly
contact.'' But Spurs coach Gregg Popovich won't allow Elliott to
scrimmage with the team until he is assured Elliott won't be at
risk.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday, Popovich said he believes Elliott's chances of
playing this season are ``not very realistic.'' That's not what
Elliott wants to hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't tell whether I can come back or not unless I get out
there and mix it up,'' Elliott said. ``There's been enough of
watching me run line drills. You can't tell whether I'm going to be
able to come back that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing like playing basketball. I can sit there and
run on the treadmill a couple miles and run lines, but it's nothing
like playing in a game.''

   MONTREAL _ Two games, two ties. They sure beat losses.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins, battling to get out of their midseason doldrums,
came back on a Steve Heinze goal late in the third period to earn a
2-2 tie with the Canadiens Saturday &UR;  &LR; night at the Molson Centre.
That follows a 0-0 tie Thursday night at home against the Sabres.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any points you can pick up on the road (are good),'' said
Bruins coach Pat Burns. ``It's still not a win, of course we'll
hear about that. It's still not a loss.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins get back at it Monday afternoon against the Atlanta
Thrashers at the FleetCenter. Then they kick off a three-game trip
in Atlanta on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In this one, they had the lead early and had a great chance with
a five-minute power play late when Scott Thornton was called for
checking Andre Savage from behind. But they could only get one shot
on Montreal's Jose Theodore.
</P>
<P>
   They'll take the tie and go home happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had one win in our last what, 10, 12 games,'' said
goalie Byron Dafoe, who kept the Bruins in it and finished with 30
saves. ``We're desperately looking for victories now. But we'll
take the point. Especially coming back and stealing the point like
that. But we need some victories.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins are 0-3-2 in their last five and 1-8-4 in their last
13.
</P>
<P>
   Heinze had a bunch of chances Thursday night against Buffalo and
had a bunch more Saturday &UR;  &LR; night playing with the two Joes _
Thornton and Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is our line,'' said Burns, who is missing Jason Allison
for the season and Dave Andreychuk and Sergei Samsonov for the time
being. ``That's our line. Heinzie's playing a lot better now. He's
like that, a streaky guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Heinze had a goal against Toronto Tuesday and Saturday &UR;  &LR; night
took advantage of a good bounce to get the tying goal with 5:47
left.
</P>
<P>
   Don Sweeney took a nice pass from Murphy, moved in, and got a
shot on Theodore. The Montreal goalie stopped the shot, but the
puck hit a defenseman's skate as it was bouncing away and headed
toward the crease. Heinze pounced on it and popped it into the open
net.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every goal-scorer I've ever talked to says don't worry as long
as you're getting your chances,'' said Heinze, who snapped a long
drought with Tuesday's goal. ``I'm getting my chances and
fortunately one went in for me tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The tie held off the Canadiens, who have been creeping up on the
Bruins. Boston is 14-19-12 and Montreal 14-24-5.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins broke on top in the first on P.J. Axelsson's sixth
goal at 9:01. But the Canadiens went in front, 2-1, scoring on
their first two power-play chances. Patrice Brisebois had the first
with 1:30 left in the opening period. The Canadiens went on top on
Karl Dykhuis's goal at 8:25 of the second.
</P>
<P>
   At the end, the Bruins had a power play for the last 2:21 of
regulation and into overtime.
</P>
<P>
   They put some pressure on, but could not score. Both teams had
chances at the end but Dafoe and Theodore stood their ground.
</P>
<P>
   Seconds after Heinze tied it, Theodore made a huge stop on
Thornton in close.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of time in front,'' Thornton said. ``I didn't
think I'd have that much time and the puck was up on edge. I should
have buried it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins had won their last three games here and now have a
5-0-3 streak going against Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal, which had the league's 14th best power play coming in,
was perfect on its first two chances and that was the difference
early.
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe had to make a series of saves early in the third period to
keep it at 2-1 and give his team a chance.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins had a great opportunity with 9:40 left. They were
shorthanded and Rob DiMaio broke in on Theodore. The goalie made
the save, but the rebound went back to DiMaio, who hit the post.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Heinze, who had hit the post earlier, got his goal and the
Bruins had their tie.

INJURED JONES STILL PUTS ON A SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Roy Jones Jr. made history Saturday &UR;  &LR; night. He became
the first male member of the Radio City Rockettes.
</P>
<P>
   Barely an hour before he was scheduled to defend the undisputed
light heavyweight title from the challenge of David Telesco, there
was Jones on the stage at Radio City Music Hall, high-kicking with
a dozen Rockettes to open HBO's telecast in a fashion that seemed
to indicate Telesco's presence was not weighing heavily on his
mind.
</P>
<P>
   An entrance that took nearly 15 minutes as Telesco paced in the
ring only added to that impression, and by the time Whitney Houston
had turned the national anthem into a 2-minute-51-second medley,
the challenger was in an angry frenzy. Soon afterward, he was in a
fog that would envelop him all 12 rounds, as he fell victim to
Jones's speed even though the champion had fractured his left wrist
in a motorcycle accident 3 1/2 weeks ago and had rejected the
advice of his father and others who had urged him not to fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad even said don't do it, but I said, `Dad, I have to do
it. I've got a big date in New York,' '' Jones said after winning a
one-sided decision with one hand, a decision in which none of the
three judges gave Telesco even one round. ``If I had both hands,
I'd have knocked him out early.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't, but he ended any doubt about what was going to happen
early. In less than a round, Jones proved that the only thing slow
about him was his entrance. From the opening bell, he slammed one
right hand after another into Telesco's cheeks, turning both sides
red in less than three minutes. They were redder 45 minutes later,
when Telesco had to listen to scores of 120-108, 120-107, and
120-107. The Globe card did not dispute those tallies.
</P>
<P>
   Things did not improve for Telesco in Round 2, and by the end of
that round he looked like someone who wished Jones had taken a
little longer to get into the ring. But now he was stuck with Jones
in front of him, knowing he could do little to get rid of him and
not much more to prevent Jones from slapping him with that right
lead whenever he wanted . . . which was often.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently growing bored, Jones spent much of the fifth round in
one of the neutral corners, taunting Telesco and waving him to
attack. When Telesco did, he landed a few body shots but paid a
dear price for it as Jones continued to crack him with those
relentless rights and then mocked him when he tried to return fire.
</P>
<P>
   This pattern continued almost unbroken until Jones finally hurt
Telesco badly with a body shot midway through the 10th round. By
the end of that round, he had Telesco's long-swelling left eye
closing badly and his ribs aching _ but in no more trouble than
he'd been from the start.
</P>
<P>
   Which, frankly, was trouble enough.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, what was weighing heavily on Derrick Jefferson's mind
was the chin of David Izon.
</P>
<P>
   For the better part of eight rounds, Jefferson pounded that chin
to no avail, and as the rounds wore on, Jefferson wore down,
building a seemingly insurmountable lead at the same time the gas
was leaking from his tank.
</P>
<P>
   After battering Izon repeatedly without finishing him, Jefferson
had won his seventh straight round, after which his troubles began.
Not long after the eighth round started, he landed one last big
left hook, and with it what was left of his energy leaked out and
he was like a shut-down nuclear reactor. He was devoid of energy.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson did last the rest of the round, but 11 seconds into
the ninth, referee Arthur Mercante Jr. finished what Izon's chin
had started, stopping the fight immediately after a flurry sent
Jefferson falling backward into the ropes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have to take his shots, he has to take mine,'' Izon
(25-3, 21 KOs) said later. ``In the seventh, I was thinking of
kneeling down, but I knew this guy would get tired. I endured all
that he gave me. I knew if I endured it, he wouldn't be able to
endure what I would give him later.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I had him in the seventh round,'' said Jefferson
(22-1-1). ``After that, I was exhausted and cramping. I just didn't
pace myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in the evening, Providence's Brian Barbosa (27-4, 19 KOs)
easily defended his NABO middleweight title by dropping Maurice
Brantley three times in the first round. The final knockdown came
at 2:44 and ended the night early for Brantley (22-3).

WALKER LEADS CELTICS ONTO RIGHT ROAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ There's no way to overstate this one.
The Celtics won on the road and they won it thanks to a dominating
performance by the oft-maligned Antoine Walker. He was exceptional.
</P>
<P>
   How exceptional? Well, on his way to the locker room after his
39-point, 11-rebound submission, he was stopped and glad-handed by
actor Danny Aiello, who was a courtside observer. He then passed by
his coach, Rick Pitino, who was talking in the hall and saying,
simply, ``This was, by far, his best offensive and defensive game
of the season.'' He then came into the locker room sat next to
Kenny Anderson, who was telling someone, ``It was probably the best
defensive game I've seen from him since I've been in Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   There you have it. Walker not only put up the aforementioned
numbers in the Celtics' nerve-wracking 99-96 victory over the New
Jersey Nets Saturday &UR;  &LR; night, he basically won the game in the final
23 seconds all by himself. With the game tied, 94-94, he got inside
and tipped in an Anderson miss. Then, after a Jersey timeout, he
stole an inexcusably lazy inbounds pass by Kendall Gill and went in
for an uncontested dunk. That settled it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without question,'' said Walker, who was 17 of 29 from the
field, ``this was a huge win. We're very ecstatic about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Paul Pierce, ``He carried us. It was nice to see.''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics acted like you'd expect them to act after winning
for just the third time in 17 road games: as if they had won the
NBA title. There was an emotional side to this one: The Nets had
seemingly recovered from their horrible start, were starting to win
at home, and were tied in the standings with the Celtics going into
the game.
</P>
<P>
   And, truth be told, the Nets could have won this one. Given the
Celtics' penchant for road collapses, it's almost a surprise they
didn't. Jersey had a 45-21 advantage in free throw attempts but was
undone by 38 percent shooting and 18 turnovers, the last two of
which were ghastly and cost the Nets the game.
</P>
<P>
   After erasing a 5-point deficit in the fourth _ that qualified
as a big lead in this game _ the Nets had the ball with the score
tied at 94. Stephon Marbury (17 points on 5-of-16 shooting) was
starting to feel it; he had scored Jersey's last 5 points,
including a flip from the line to tie it at 94. So what did he do?
He lost the ball. No one made him do it. He just lost the ball.
That gave the Celtics the opening, and Walker snuck in for the tip
of Anderson's miss.
</P>
<P>
   There was still plenty of time left (22.7 seconds), however, and
the Nets called time. Gill then tried to lob a pass into Keith Van
Horn, but Walker anticipated the lazy delivery and made the easy
steal and subsequent dunk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a free shot and I took it,'' Walker said of his only
steal. ``Finally, a little luck went our way.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Gill, ``The man (Van Horn) was wide open. I didn't see
Walker until the very end. He came out of nowhere. It was a good
play on his part. I give him credit. He suckered us into that
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker was clearly the supernova on this night. Time and again
he would torch the defensively challenged Van Horn, who virtually
all night had to play him straight up. That's almost cruel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised they did that,'' Pierce said. ``He was taking
it to them every time it was one on one.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Celtics also got some help from their press, which
Pitino has been reluctant to deploy lately. He went with it more
than in the recent past, and it produced big plays. Said Pitino,
``The press has given us a big lift.''
</P>
<P>
   The press forced a big turnover that led to a Pierce steal and
dunk and a 92-87 lead with 3:14 to play. The Celtics didn't score
again for nearly two minutes, by which time New Jersey had tied the
game on two Gill free throws and 3 points by Marbury.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics then got lucky. Walker lost the ball in traffic, got
it back, and converted while getting fouled. He missed the free
throw. Marbury then hit his flip to create the final tie.
</P>
<P>
   The press, however, didn't force Marbury's critical turnover. It
didn't force Gill's stupid pass. Those were instances of the Nets
reverting to what they were over the season's first 17 games (2-15)
rather than the last 16 (13-6).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more of a focus-and-concentration issue,'' New Jersey
coach Don Casey said.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics didn't care. As Anderson put it, ``We just needed a
win on the road, regardless of who we played.''
</P>
<P>
   They got it. They left for Washington a group of happy fellows.

BOTCHED KICK ALLOWS TAMPA TO ESCAPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA _ We'll never know if Redskin kicker Brett Conway would
have boomed a 52-yard, game-winning field goal through the
uprights. He never got his toe on the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's 15-year veteran lineman Dan Turk botched the snap
and with it went Washington's chance to advance to the NFC
Championship Game.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay took advantage of three Washington blunders and
rebounded from a 13-0 deficit to advance with a 14-13 win over the
Redskins. Long-maligned as the Sacramento Kings of the NFL, the
Bucs ended a quarter-century of futility with the franchise's first
January victory.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa's 22-year-old Shaun King threw the game-winning touchdown
pass with 7:29 left in the game and became the first rookie to win
an NFL playoff game since Pat Haden beat the Cowboys for the Los
Angeles Rams in 1976. The Sun King, now 5-1 as a starter since
taking over for Trent Dilfer (shoulder), was stifled for 2 1/2
quarters, then delighted the patient 65,835 with two touchdown
drives.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew he was pressing a little bit,'' said Tampa coach Tony
Dungy, referring to his quarterback's 4-for-16 start. ``It was just
a matter of waiting for him to make the plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Tampa's first TD came on a highlight-reel pinball run by
snowplow fullback Mike Alstott. King floated a 1-yard TD pass to
John Davis for the game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   In the nation's capital, this will be the one that got away. The
Redskins smothered the Bucs for the first 40 minutes, but the tide
reversed when John Lynch picked off Brad Johnson with five minutes
to play in the third quarter. A Johnson fumble led to the second
Tampa touchdown, but the game was still winnable.
</P>
<P>
   On their final, fateful drive, the Redskins took over on their
38 with 3:05 left. They moved the ball to the Bucs' 33, then lined
up for the field goal on fourth-and-3 with 1:17 left. Conway had
already drilled a 48-yarder, and this time had the wind at his
back.
</P>
<P>
   But Turk's snap bounced a couple of times before it got to
holder Johnson. Johnson had no choice but to scramble and was
sacked before he could get off a throw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I short-armed it,'' Turk said of the snap that bounced the
Redskins right out of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brad never had a chance,'' Washington coach Norv Turner said.
``The timing was gone. One guy didn't get the job done, not the
whole special-teams unit.''
</P>
<P>
   The win was Tampa's ninth in 10 games. The Bucs could host the
NFC Championship Game next Sunday if the Vikings beat the Rams
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said we wouldn't mind ugly wins all the way to the Super
Bowl,'' said Dungy.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins had the NFL's second-ranked offense and did not
score fewer than 17 points in any game this season. But Saturday,
Washington's offense failed to score a touchdown and only gained 26
yards on 27 plays in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   It often takes the deliberate Bucs some time to get rolling. The
first quarter was a 0-0 snorefest. It was like a Bruins scrimmage
or any Revolution game. Punters Mark Royals (Tampa Bay) and Matt
Turk took turns in a boring battle for field position. The Bucs
managed only one first down in the period and the vaunted running
duo of Warrick Dunn and Alstott combined for 12 yards on six
carries.
</P>
<P>
   Thrills were sparse in the second quarter, particularly for
Tampa fans. In the middle of the quarter, the Redskins started a
drive at Tampa Bay's 44 and lurched to the 10 on seven plays before
Conway kicked a 28-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   There were 11 punts in the first half, six by the conservative
Bucs. First-half scoring droughts were a Buccaneer trademark in
1999 and the locals had faith the hometown team would score in the
second half.
</P>
<P>
   But it Washington that scored first. Brian Mitchell, the
Redskins' all-purpose runner, took the second-half kickoff and went
100 yards up the right sideline for the game's first touchdown. The
highlight of the run to paydirt was a stiff-arm to the face of
Tampa kicker Martin Gramatica. It was the longest kickoff return in
NFL postseason history, topping 99-yard gamebreaker by Green Bay's
Desmond Howard in the 1997 Super Bowl (remember that one?), and the
first allowed by Tampa in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   There were already questions about King's ability to put points
on the board when he was picked off by Darrell Green with 10
minutes left in the third. Conway converted the game's first
turnover into a 48-yard field goal to take a 13-0 lead with 8:10
left in the third period as Raymond James Stadium went silent. The
favorites were in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   But Washington committed the next two turnovers (interception,
fumble) and the Bucs turned them into a pair of touchdowns.

KINGS LOSE IN OVERTIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE _ Even tying the game in the final minutes of
regulation could not end the Kings' misery, which passed the
one-month mark Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   It gave the Kings a point in the standings, which is no small
feat these days, but Luc Robitaille's goal in the final minutes of
regulation only led to an overtime score by Jeff Friesen and a 3-2
loss to the San Jose Sharks.
</P>
<P>
   Since Dec. 14, the Kings are 2-10-1, dropping them into a tie
with Calgary for the seventh playoff spot in the Western
Conference. If the Mighty Ducks, who lost again, weren't playing so
badly, this slump could be far more devastating.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I look at is the point we got tonight,'' said Jamie Storr,
who returned to the Kings net after missing a month with a
concussion. ``We were in a spot to come away with nothing. If we
were horrible, that is one thing. But we are still playing hard and
knowing that makes this a little less frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   The new overtime rules award a point for regulation ties even if
the team loses in overtime. But there was little reward for the
Kings' power play, which was 0 for 6 until Robitaille's goal.
</P>
<P>
   And they had little answer for the Sharks' top player, Owen
Nolan, who scored twice, including a short-handed goal on the first
shot Storr has faced since Dec. 15 against the New York Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings had some momentum when they killed off a five-on-three
penalty to Brad Chartrand and Mattias Norstrom in the second
period. And they were looking at a five-minute man advantage after
a high-stick penalty to former King Tony Granato, who bloodied
Norstrom's upper lip. But less than three minutes later, Rob Blake
was whistled for interference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blake was the best guy on the ice tonight; he played just a
terrific game,'' coach Andy Murray said. ``But we need to get more
out of our top people.''
</P>
<P>
   That includes Ziggy Palffy, who did not know if he could play
until testing his lower back in pregame warmups. Palffy had an
assist on Robitaille's goal with 1:33 left in regulation, but he
only had two shots and was on the ice for both of Nolan's goals.
</P>
<P>
   While Nolan set the tone early, the Kings' inability to counter
hurt. Without Jozef Stumpel, out at least two weeks with a knee
injury and Glen Murray, who could be sidelined three weeks with a
bruised chest muscle, the first and second lines were ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Smolinski, the club's leading scorer with 38 points,
centers the second line with Murray. He already was playing without
his other winger Donald Audette and was limited to just one shot.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings' first goal came from Chartrand, who is getting
playing time after having some injuries of his own.
</P>
<P>
   His goal pleased Andy Murray and not just because Chartrand is a
personal favorite. Chartrand scored it after getting flattened by
Andy Sutton in the Kings' end. Chartrand got off the ice and
streaked toward the Sharks' end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not use the word frustrated about what we are going
through,'' Murray said. ``I would say disappointed. Frustrated
means were are confused and we don't know what we are doing out
there. There is no problem with the effort this team is giving.''
</P>
<P>
   He is pleased enough to give the team today off despite its
third consecutive loss.
</P>
<P>
   But scoring remains a problem. In the Kings' first three
power-play opportunities, they had just one shot and put themselves
in a deep hole by falling behind 2-0 to Nolan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough greeting,'' said Storr, who allowed the first
one 1:36 into the game. ``But things got better from there.
Really.''

 &HT;    A look back on King's words
 &HT;    By Arnold Garcia
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Anyone who was alive and aware during the Civil
Rights era will never forget the powerful voice of Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr. and the message it delivered.
</P>
<P>
   All of us have our favorite quotations, including the famous ``I
have a dream.'' As stirring as that speech was, it teeters on the
edge of overuse and falls over occasionally _ especially this time
of year. That's why today, we've chosen to republish Dr. King's
``Letter from Birmingham jail'' and I've chosen to share with you
excerpts from his last speech, which reveals a man who peered into
the future and apparently saw his destiny.
</P>
<P>
   To set the context: King had traveled to Memphis in April 1968
in support of sanitation workers who were on strike. His last
speech, with its emotional conclusion, was delivered the night
before his life _ but not his light _ was extinguished on the
balcony of the Lorraine Motel.
</P>
<P>
   ``... I'm delighted to see each of you here tonight in spite of
a storm warning. You reveal that you are determined to go on
anyhow. Something is happening in Memphis; something is happening
in our world.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you know, if I were standing at the beginning of time, with
the possibility of general and panoramic view of the whole human
history up to now, and the Almighty said to me, `Martin Luther
King, which age would you like to live in?' `` ... Strangely
enough, I would turn to the Almighty, and say, `If you allow me to
live just a few years in the second half of the 20th century, I
will be happy.' Now that's a strange statement to make, because the
world is all messed up. The nation is sick. Trouble is in the land.
Confusion all around. But I know, somehow, that only when it is
dark enough, can you see the stars. And I see God working in this
period of the 20th century in a way that men, in some strange way,
are responding _ something is happening in our world. The masses of
people are rising up. And wherever they are assembled today,
whether they are in Johannesburg, South Africa; Nairobi, Kenya;
Accra, Ghana; New York City; Atlanta, Ga.; Jackson, Miss.; or
Memphis, Tenn. _ the cry is always the same _ `We want to be free.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And another reason that I'm happy to live in this period is
that we have been forced to a point where we're going to have to
grapple with the problems that men have been trying to grapple with
through history, but the demand didn't force them to do it.
Survival demands that we grapple with them. Men, for years now,
have been talking about war and peace. But now, no longer can they
just talk about it. It is no longer a choice between violence and
nonviolence in this world; it's nonviolence or nonexistence.
</P>
<P>
   `` ... if something isn't done, and in a hurry, to bring the
colored peoples of the world out of their long years of poverty,
their long years of hurt and neglect, the whole world is doomed.
</P>
<P>
   ``... let us keep the issues where they are. The issue is
injustice. The issue is the refusal of Memphis to be fair and
honest in its dealings with its public servants, who happen to be
sanitation workers. Now, we've got to keep attention on that. ``...
We've got to give ourselves to this struggle until the end. Nothing
would be more tragic than to stop at this point, in Memphis. We've
got to see it through.
</P>
<P>
   ``And let us move on in these powerful days, these days of
challenge, to make America what it ought to be. We have an
opportunity to make America a better nation. And I want to thank
God, once more, for allowing me to be here with you.
</P>
<P>
   ``... It really doesn't matter what happens now. I left Atlanta
this morning, and as we got started on the plane, the pilot said
over the public address system, `We are sorry for the delay, but we
have Dr. Martin Luther King on the plane. And to be sure that all
of the bags were checked, and to be sure that nothing would be
wrong with the plane, we had to check out everything carefully. And
we've had the plane protected and guarded all night.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And then I got to Memphis. And some began to say the threats,
or talk about the threats that were out. What would happen to me
from some of our sick white brothers?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I don't know what will happen now. We've got some
difficult days ahead. But it doesn't matter with me now. Because
I've been to the mountaintop. Like anybody, I would like to live a
long life. Longevity has its place. But I'm not concerned about
that now. I just want to do God's will. And He's allowed me to go
up to the mountain. And I've looked over. And I've seen the
promised land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know
tonight, that we, as a people, will get to the promised land. And
I'm happy, tonight. I'm not worried about anything. I'm not fearing
any man. Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord.''
</P>
<P>
   Amen.

 &HT;    Despite track record, Norwood risks status over patients' rights
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ He's a card carrying member of the National Rifle
Association, and proud of it.
</P>
<P>
   He's fiercely opposed to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks 10 percent of the federal budget should go back into
taxpayers' pockets.
</P>
<P>
   He will go to his grave admiring Ronald Reagan above all other
presidents.
</P>
<P>
   So, why are Republican leaders so mad at Charlie Norwood?
</P>
<P>
   It's not just because the Georgia congressman took on his party
leadership on patients' rights. It's because he beat them. And he
did it by building a bipartisan coalition in concert with his
liberal Democratic co-sponsor, Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.).
</P>
<P>
   The Norwood-Dingell bill, which gives patients the right to sue
managed care companies for making medical decisions that wrongly
deny care, passed the House last year, to the embarrassment of the
GOP leadership, which opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charlie has a strong sense of right and wrong, but he's paying
a heavy political price for it,'' says Dingell, an unabashed
admirer of Norwood's political courage.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Norwood defeated incumbent Democrat Don Johnson in
Georgia's 10th District as part of Newt Gingrich's Republican
revolution. On the litmus-test issues for Republicans then and now,
Norwood qualifies as the perfect poster boy, someone who could be
counted on to toe the party line. He grew up in Valdosta, graduated
from Georgetown dental school and served in Vietnam, where he won a
Combat Medical Badge and two Bronze Stars for his actions in
combat. Somebody in his family has served in every American war, he
says.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, war and football shaped much of who Norwood is. He
played offensive tackle for the late Wright Bazemore, the legendary
coach at Valdosta High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't making A's as much as if you could tackle good,''
Norwood recalls.
</P>
<P>
   And when he tackled his party hierarchy last year and won, he
hailed it as a battle akin to taking Hamburger Hill. But Norwood
barely had time to savor the 275-151 victory before his friend,
House Speaker Dennis Hastert, slapped him down by refusing to
appoint him to the House-Senate conference committee where the
final battle will be fought. The Senate health care reform bill
doesn't include the controversial right-to-sue provision.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Norwood has nothing but kind words for Hastert: ``Maybe
he didn't want to throw me into that brier patch.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dingell makes no bones about the insult. The House rules
call for a majority of conference committee members who reflect the
House position. Yet only one of Hastert's appointees voted in the
end for the Norwood-Dingell provision.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it's Norwood's sense of moral right, a favorite GOP
buzzphrase, that led him to risk bucking his party. He argues that
insurers should be held accountable for their decisions, just like
ordinary folks.
</P>
<P>
   Norwood is convinced that direct accountability for
decison-making that affects people's lives is inherent in
conservative philosophy, and he still regrets that the party didn't
jump on board.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't want big government making health care decisions
for you, why would you want big corporations doing it,'' he says.
He doesn't disavow his Southern populist roots.
</P>
<P>
   Norwood longs to spend more time on his 40 acres along the
Savannah River near Augusta, where he has ``about the best
smokehouse and venison in Georgia.'' He saves Sundays for his
family _ including two small granddaughters.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he knows the biggest battle of his political life is
looming, and that a lot of his staunchest opponents are on his own
team.
</P>
<P>
   The mild-mannered Norwood, however, is tougher on the inside
than many people know. But Dingell knows.
</P>
<P>
   It usually takes a certain ``ripening'' to frame a conscience
while in Congress, Dingell says. But Norwood came with one built
in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's conservatives like Charlie,'' Dingell says, ``who will
provide the leadership to eliminate the mean spiritedness around
here.''

 &HT;    Digital manipulation of images on CBS news shows hurts
credibility
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ When Time magazine was caught digitally doctoring
O.J. Simpson's picture on its cover to make him appear menacing,
the deception was properly condemned as unethical.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, ABC was properly skewered in 1994 for using fakery to
make viewers believe that Cokie Roberts, wrapped in a coat, was
giving a report on the scene at Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Roberts was standing inside the ABC News Washington
Bureau in front of a projection of the Capitol behind her. ABC News
anchor Peter Jennings introduced Roberts as reporting from Capitol
Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Purposeful deception of readers and viewers undermines
credibility of serious journalism. Such deceit must be vigorously
censured to maintain the public's trust. Serious journalists must
bend over backward to give accurate, truthful reporting.
</P>
<P>
   Time and ABC apologized for their deceptions.
</P>
<P>
   The other day the New York Times revealed that CBS has hired a
company to digitally change scenes, which it has been doing
regularly on ``The Early Show'' and its newsmagazine ``48 Hours.''
</P>
<P>
   On New Year's Eve, the network used digital deception in the
scene shown behind CBS News anchor Dan Rather.
</P>
<P>
   A big billboard in Times Square behind Rather during the Dec. 30
and 31 live ``CBS Evening News'' telecasts advertised CBS with its
logo.
</P>
<P>
   That CBS billboard wasn't there. It was a digital fake. Worse,
CBS used the fake CBS billboard to cover up a real NBC-sponsored
sign and a Budweiser advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   Worse still, when the CBS trickery was uncovered, Eric Shapiro,
director of the ``CBS Evening News''; Andrew Heyward, president of
CBS News; and Leslie Moonves, CEO of CBS Television, defended the
practice and promised to do more of it.
</P>
<P>
   This could be an example of desperate people taking desperate
actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Early Show'' is stuck in third place in the morning
news-entertainment network contest. The ``CBS Evening News'' also
is in trouble in the ratings.
</P>
<P>
   CBS hired Princeton Video Image to help plant digital branding
into its broadcasts. Since Nov. 1, CBS has been using this service
to put CBS logos and counterfeit CBS billboards in live scenes to
make viewers believe the logos and billboards actually are on
buildings, a horse-drawn carriage, a landmark fountain and other
places.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great way to do things without ruining the
neighborhood,'' Steve Friedman, executive producer of ``The Early
Show,'' told the New York Times. ``And we haven't even scratched
the surface of its uses yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro, the director of ``CBS Evening News,'' said, ``The
technique, I find, works best if you put it someplace where there
is intended to be something.''
</P>
<P>
   That's profound. If you are going to deceive your audience, do
it where you can get away with it.
</P>
<P>
   Heyward described the digital deception as ``a whimsical and
creative way to display our logo in various and unlikely places.''
</P>
<P>
   The CBS News president said the digitally faked CBS sign that
covered the real NBC Jumbotron on Times Square was ``an extension
of electronic signage,'' which is lame.
</P>
<P>
   Moonves, Heyward's boss, said, ``Any time there's an NBC logo up
in our network we will block it again.'' Later he attempted to
downplay his call for dirty tricks by saying that if the NBC logo
was part of a news story _ ``if somebody used an NBC logo to commit
a murder _ we wouldn't cut it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Rather, who knew about the fake images implanted in the live
scene behind him, did not object at the time. Now he says, ``I did
not grasp the ethical implication of this, and that was wrong on my
part.'' At the very least, Rather said, CBS should have pointed out
to viewers what they were doing.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, knock off the deception and dirty tricks. It drags
us all down.

 &HT;    Motor safety rarely has the pedestrian in equation
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ His name was Boomer, short for Boomerang. The
part-Siamese porch cat would disappear for days but always return.
Then one night, after becoming such a fixture that he'd ceased
wandering, he didn't come home. I found him dead in the beam of a
street light, and cursed the imbecile who wouldn't slow down on our
lightly traveled neighborhood street.
</P>
<P>
   The other day while driving, I had to brake for a man with
weathered skin and a limp. Either he was ignoring the ``don't
walk'' or the words didn't translate. Had I plowed over his body no
one would have looked askance at me. He'd have been in the wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Strange, though. When I looked at the pedestrian, for a half a
second I didn't see a man. I saw Boomer.
</P>
<P>
   Pedestrians get confused. They make bad judgment calls. Boomer
should have known better than to get caught between headlights. So,
too, this man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Proceed at your own risk,'' we all know when the issue is
safety on our streets. But pedestrians, particularly the young and
distracted, don't always weigh the risk.
</P>
<P>
   We do a miserable job in tending to their safety, whether it is
in providing sidewalks to get them to school or instructing them
how to walk safely. If you have no sidewalk, walk on the shoulder
facing the nearest oncoming lane _ to make eye contact with the car
closest to you. This is serious. Understand?
</P>
<P>
   Similarly we send youngsters out on bicycles without instructing
them that bikes are vehicles just like cars. Ride with traffic on
the far right side. Riding opposite traffic courts tragedy. Drivers
turning into traffic aren't expecting a bicycle to come hurtling at
them from the far right.
</P>
<P>
   Failure to convey these simple rules is a serious social
shortcoming. But another thing we don't do is internalize the
precautions drivers need to avoid killing a child who gets caught
in the crosswalk, or one whose bike wobbles into harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   Some tragedies are unavoidable. City arteries are meant for
conveying traffic at a robust speed. But neighborhood streets are
meant to be shared, to have cars backing out of driveways, balls
bouncing out of the front yard, 8-year-olds trying two wheels
without training wheels.
</P>
<P>
   People who drive through neighborhood streets too often do it
oblivious to physical laws about stopping in time.
</P>
<P>
   A car traveling at 40 mph is going 60 feet per second. Assuming
reaction time to be 2.5 seconds, the vehicle will travel 150 feet
before even an alert driver hits the brakes.
</P>
<P>
   This makes 40 mph on a neighborhood street a deadly speed.
</P>
<P>
   An Australian study found that the average driver traveling at
40 mph who has a pedestrian 100 feet straight ahead will still be
traveling 38 mph should they hit. The pedestrian is as good as
dead.
</P>
<P>
   The same study says that the average driver who is going 25 mph
will have stopped in those 100 feet.
</P>
<P>
   So a rule of thumb for motorists, alongside the rules we must
drum into the heads of pedestrians and bicyclists, is to go no
faster than 25 mph on a neighborhood, nonartery street. That speed
is better.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, we can all think of nonartery streets that get treated like
arteries. So do police. It would be useful for police to do a
little ``consciousness-raising'' along those stretches to remind
motorists where they're driving.
</P>
<P>
   There are reasons for hope in this regard. Every time I take the
boys to school in the morning, I go through the stretch of New Road
fronting Crestview Elementary. To a remarkable extent, motorists
doggedly observe the 20 mph limit and the flashing yellow lights.
Or at least the numbskulls who want to ignore the lights have no
way to speed on, because both lanes have slowed to a crawl.
</P>
<P>
   We all need reminders, either by flashing light or by ingrained
images of the innocent. Mine has four legs.

 &HT;    Ordinary life in America a haven for Kosovars
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If for a fleeting moment, they feel more like hostages
than refugees, they need only remember what landed them in this
poor southeast Atlanta neighborhood between a prison and a
junkyard.
</P>
<P>
   Hate.
</P>
<P>
   Oppression.
</P>
<P>
   War.
</P>
<P>
   Now, husbands are off to work, children at school, older sons
and daughters out getting driver's licenses or at jobs or looking
for jobs, and the Kosovar women stay behind. Pounding bread dough
on the kitchen table, washing socks in the bathtub, listening to TV
shows they can't really follow. Most hesitate to leave their modest
apartments and venture into their neighborhood because of their
limited
</P>
<P>
   English and fear for their safety.
</P>
<P>
   But the women have each other for comfort, companionship,
conversation. Gathering in their plain living rooms, they swap
pieces of information about their children's schools, a job lead or
another supermarket discovery. Vanilla-scented air freshener to
spray in the bathroom, can you believe it?
</P>
<P>
   ``In Kosova, I was afraid for my daughter when she left for
school. I would never know if she would return home alive,''
Sheribane Jusufi (SHAY-rah-bana You-SU-fee) says through her
daughter, Adelina, who uses the Albanian pronunciation customary in
Kosovo, the southern province of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Adelina serves as an interpreter one recent evening when several
women gather at the Jusufi apartment. ``Maybe the policemen will
kill her.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``policemen'' were Serbian, intimidation their job.
Beginning in 1989, the police and other armed Serb forces
systematically stripped Albanian Kosovars of most of their jobs,
schools, mosques, government institutions and, most thoroughly,
their dignity.
</P>
<P>
   For a decade, they endured interrogation, arbitrary arrests and
torture. Then the harassment erupted
</P>
<P>
   into full-fledged war and a chaotic human retreat. Almost 20,000
Kosovars a day streamed across borders to safety, overwhelming
refugee camps and carrying tales of horror and narrow escapes:
Serbs pouring gasoline near them and threatening to strike a match.
Soldiers holding guns to their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Family history stolen with torches to homes. It's a lot to think
about, let alone live through.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why the nine families forming the tiny Albanian village
in an Atlanta apartment complex do not mind concerning themselves
with the mundane routine of the working poor in America.
</P>
<P>
   Getting up at 4 a.m. to catch a van shuttle to a dismal factory
job in Lawrenceville, Ga. Riding a bicycle
</P>
<P>
   home at 1 a.m. after an eight-hour shift washing dishes. Waiting
for six hours at Grady Memorial Hospital to see a doctor.
Scrutinizing prices and calculating savings on the endless cereal
offerings at Kroger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a freedom country now and we do not have to be
afraid,'' says Hanemsha Berkolli, 48, a mother of five. ``And the
money situation is better here than in Kosova.''
</P>
<P>
   TACKLING ENGLISH
</P>
<P>
   Refugee: a person who flees from home or country to seek refuge
elsewhere, as in a time of war or of political or religious
persecution. (Webster's New World College Dictionary)
</P>
<P>
   Seven months after the Kosovars arrived, the transition is still
difficult. Their new and confusing world sometimes seems to spin
around them. They've come to rely on their children, who are much
quicker students of English, to help with grocery shopping, talking
to doctors and answering the phone. During the summer, volunteers
spent many hours teaching English to families, and the learning
accelerated for children once they started school.
</P>
<P>
   ``The children are doing well but I worry about depression with
the adults,'' volunteer Lyn Almon says. ``The ones who don't have
jobs aren't progressing with English and they seem stuck.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the 51 Kosovar Albanians at the apartment complex arrived
knowing English: Adelina Jusufi, 17, youngest in a family of four
children, and Remzi Grajqevci, (RAM-see Gri-JEFF-see) 38, married
and a father of two young daughters. Grajqevci eventually was hired
by Catholic Social Services as a
</P>
<P>
   refugee caseworker, while Adelina is often called upon by the
families to unravel mysteries ranging from instant coffee to
prescription instructions.
</P>
<P>
   What's in this brown plastic bottle? (Hydrogen peroxide.) Why do
I have to keep signing papers my children bring home from school?
Can you read this government form to me?
</P>
<P>
   ``I started learning English when I was 12 in Kosova,'' Adelina
says. ``Maybe, I thought, I would like to go to college here, but
never did I ever think my family would be living in the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   SO MUCH LEFT BEHIND
</P>
<P>
   ``Do not look back, and do not dream about the future either. .
. . Your duty, your reward, your destiny are here and now.'' _ Dag
Hammarskjold, former United Nations secretary-general
</P>
<P>
   Shoes pile up outside doors of Kosovar dwellings. Tiny stuffed
animals given to the kids by soldiers at Fort Dix, N.J., sit atop
donated TV sets. Report cards, drug prescription records and
telephone
</P>
<P>
   numbers get neatly tucked away in table drawers and hanging
baskets. Basic food items _ flour, salt, sugar, eggs by the two
dozen _ line kitchen shelves and refrigerators.
</P>
<P>
   But what's absent is most noticeable.
</P>
<P>
   No wedding photos, no family heirlooms, no framed artwork, no
well-worn blanket draping a chair. ``I used to have many, many
plants in my home in Kosova,'' Rukije (RU-kee-a) Berkolli said one
Sunday when a visitor surprises her with an ivy plant wrapped in
green aluminum. ``But we can't take nothing, nothing when we go.''
</P>
<P>
   Half the Albanians in the complex are from the Berkolli-Kaleshi
families, headed by four men _ two brothers, a cousin and a
brother-in-law. As is common in Kosovo, the extended clan all lived
near one another in Pristina, the capital.
</P>
<P>
   A TOUGH NEIGHBORHOOD
</P>
<P>
   In May, the Berkollis were among the first Kosovar families to
arrive in Georgia and to be placed by Catholic Social Services, one
of several metro Atlanta resettlement agencies assisting refugees.
Because many had large families and wished to live near relatives,
the apartment complex was the best choice, said Rebecca Kloss of
Catholic Social Services. Its rent is low, $520 monthly, and the
complex is near supermarkets and public transportation.
</P>
<P>
   But with the low-income, transient neighborhood comes the usual
problems of crime and concern. Four donated bicycles were stolen
one by one from a family this summer; another refugee woke up to
find that vandals had broken into his used Jeep and jammed the
ignition in a futile attempt to steal it. And there's constant
worry about drug dealing in the streets that form loops around the
clusters of two-story brick duplex apartments.
</P>
<P>
   Still, most say they wouldn't want to live elsewhere in Atlanta
just yet, especially if it means not being
</P>
<P>
   surrounded by other Albanian Kosovars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, all our brothers and sisters are in the apartment
complex,'' said Feride (Fa-RE-dee) Berkolli, sister-in-law to
Hanemsha and the mother of a son and daughter. ``We want to stay
together.''
</P>
<P>
   To get the families started, resettlement agencies picked up
rent and other expenses for the first three months. The families
began learning English and other basic skills, such as using
American currency, getting around Atlanta by bus and rail and where
and how to shop for food. They applied for Social Security cards,
food stamps and Medicaid to cover health care.
</P>
<P>
   Tiny steps slowly are adding up. Getting a factory job making
car window parts, then a better opportunity working at a restaurant
preparing catered food. For some wives and adult daughters, picking
up part-time jobs at a hotel cleaning rooms. Passing the Georgia
driver's license test. Learning to navigate Atlanta's maze of
streets behind the wheel of a donated car or a cheap, used one.
Getting children registered for school. Opening checking accounts.
Mastering a MARTA bus schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after six months, some families are reaching goals: better
jobs, better language skills, more independence, less frustration.
Children are excelling in school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their teachers tell me they are making progress way beyond and
faster than their Hispanic and Asian counterparts,'' said Julie
Jabaley, 31, an Atlanta resident who's devoted countless hours to
helping the families since July.
</P>
<P>
   Jabaley's name is one the families know well, along with
Maryellen LeDuc, Christina Risco-Turner, Michael Gaertner, Jerry
Pace, Greg Paye, Mohamad Muataz Malak of Muslim Social Services and
Lyn Almon, Tom Reichert and Lenora Lockwood with downtown Sacred
Heart Church. Collectively, they are known as ``the volunteers.''
</P>
<P>
   AN ARMY OF VOLUNTEERS
</P>
<P>
   None knew one another before they started visiting the Kosovar
families nearly every day, taking them shopping for clothes,
teaching them to hunt for bargains at supermarkets, shuttling them
to dental and doctor appointments, helping them with everything
from finding a job to making instant mashed potatoes. They've also
been responsible for the family's few moments of worry-free joy:
turning their boys and girls into princesses and pirates for
Halloween; organizing outings to Braves and Hawks games and pizza
joints; laughing over the Thanksgiving misinterpretation of
``Thanks, give me.''
</P>
<P>
   Without the small army of volunteers, some families say they
would be much worse off because promises made in refugee camps have
yet to unfold in the Land of Opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many were told misleading and inaccurate information when
making a decision about whether to come to the United States,''
Jabaley says. ``They lived pretty much a middle-class existence and
here they're virtual paupers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Grajqevci family, whom Jabaley helps, also compare their
lives to Kosovar families elsewhere who were matched with churches
or neighborhoods. Because one group of people is assisting one
family instead of one individual helping a community of families,
``it gives them a huge advantage,'' Jabaley says. ``Some sponsors
raise enough money to pay rent for a year, or they've found them
jobs before the families even arrived.''
</P>
<P>
   But everything is relative. All the Kosovar refugees in Georgia
have enjoyed far more attention, donations and support than any
other previous group of persecuted people. And, of course, the here
and now trumps the past, no matter what hand of charitable cards
they hold.
</P>
<P>
   Most challenging for the volunteers is finding tolerable jobs
for the refugees, who were accountants, teachers, postal workers.
Halim Kaleshi, 35, worked as a mason at construction jobs in
Kosovo, a job that shouldn't be hard to replicate in booming
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But he didn't have a way to get to construction sites, so he
took the first job that came along to support his wife and three
children, ages, 8, 4 and 1. It was at Auto Ventshade Co., a car
parts assembly plant in Lawrenceville where four of the Kosovar men
still work. A co-worker from outside the neighborhood
</P>
<P>
   picked them up, charging $25 a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The job was easy, but I couldn't learn English there,''
Kaleshi said. ``Everyone speak Vietnamese.''
</P>
<P>
   Making ends meet was another problem. Kaleshi's wages, $8.30 an
hour, had to cover $520 rent, $200 for utilities and the phone,
$100 monthly car insurance, gas, diapers, other drugstore items and
food not bought with $320 in food stamps.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, Kaleshi and his wife, Shyhrete, (Sur-RAY-tah)
found full-time jobs in the cafeterias of the College Park school
district. The pay is 30 cents an hour less than the factory job,
but now there are two paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the refugees, he sends whatever money he can to
relatives in Kosovo to help them rebuild and get through the winter
with heat and food. He wants to fly back to Kosovo to visit his
mother and siblings in the spring. The working parents have
discovered the practical side of not having a
</P>
<P>
   grandmother next door: $600 a month now goes to a baby sitter.
</P>
<P>
   THE RIGHT DECISION?
</P>
<P>
   ``As we have learned in Bosnia, when conflict ends, the more
difficult job of winning the peace begins.'' _ Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright
</P>
<P>
   As they do every year, Albanians celebrated Flag Day on Nov. 28
in recognition of Albania's 1912 declaration of independence.
</P>
<P>
   In Fayetteville, 250 metro area Kosovar Albanians gathered at
Providence United Methodist Church to sing songs, laugh at skits
and pose with the Albanian flag, which is dominated by a two-headed
black eagle.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, similar joyful scenes unfolded across the
countryside, villages and cities. But just after midnight, a crowd
in Pristina pulled three Serbs, a man and two women, from their car
and assaulted them before hundreds of witnesses. The man was shot
dead and the women sustained multiple injuries,
</P>
<P>
   according to a NATO statement that warned that ``incidents like
this can only stand in the way of Kosovo's development into a
democratic society.''
</P>
<P>
   Officially, civil war is no longer tearing Kosovo apart.
Peacekeeping NATO personnel numbering 50,000 are seeing to that. Or
trying to.
</P>
<P>
   But not a day goes by without reports of Serbian homes torched,
Albanian men shot in bars, caches of grenades and automatic weapons
seized, fingers blown off detonating mines and revenge killings on
both sides of the long-simmering feud.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a tense situation,'' relief organizer Ramiz Duka
recently told a gathering of Atlanta's Kosovar refugees. ``And
everyone is saying they are not the guilty ones. Everyone is
suddenly looking innocent now.''
</P>
<P>
   An Albanian who's lived in the United States since 1983, Duka is
coordinating relief efforts to rebuild mosques and cultural centers
in Kosovo with the group Albanian-Islamic Cultural Center of Staten
Island. Every two months, he accompanies huge donations of food and
clothing to the region, seeing firsthand the destruction and dire
living conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``That country is devastated. You just can't believe it,'' he
says. ``In the mountainous region of Drenica,
</P>
<P>
   every single home is destroyed. People are trying to survive
living outside but they won't be able to. NATO thought it would
have eight months to rebuild homes and do it after this winter but
people returned so fast.''
</P>
<P>
   To date, 90 percent of the Albanians who fled Kosovo have
returned, NATO officials estimate. Nearly one-third of the 365,000
homes in Kosovo sustained major damage, leaving 840,000 people in
need of shelter. More than 200 international aid groups are
frantically working under the direction of Atlanta-based CARE USA
to deliver shelter kits, food, firewood and other supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one expected that many people to return so quickly to
Kosovo,'' Duka says. ``NATO wasn't in place to start helping them
rebuild, so they started themselves. I've never seen a will to go
back and to have peace and such love for their country like the
Kosovars (have).''
</P>
<P>
   Among Georgia's 600 Kosovar refugees, the feeling is the same.
It's evident in their faces when they're
</P>
<P>
   asked whether they will stay or go back home. The question
brings a range of answers from ``I'm never going back'' to ``Maybe
in five years'' to ``Just to visit, no stay.''
</P>
<P>
   It also invariably triggers images of their relatives _
brothers, sisters, aging parents and others they try to call every
week in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sad for my mother,'' says Rukije Berkolli, 42, a mother
of five, ages 7 to 20. She pulls out an old black-and-white photo
from a plastic wallet sleeve, the only item she grabbed in March
when the ``leave or be killed'' order from Serbs started her
family's journey to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe her 62-year-old mother will die before she sees her again.
Maybe they'll save enough money for a visit next summer to check on
her mom and whatever is left of their house. Or maybe she and her
husband, Mitat, will give up on life improving here and return to
the mountainous countryside that is ravaged but at least familiar.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they'll stay and she'll see her sons, Besim, Selatin and
Nexhmedin, go off to college or her little girl, Nerimane, grow up
and become CNN's next Christiane Amanpour. Maybe this is the best
place for her oldest child, Behar, deaf since birth and now working
at Heaping Bowl and Brew restaurant in East Atlanta, to find a
career to match his sharp mind and outgoing personality.
</P>
<P>
   But right now in her apartment home, the soup needs stirring,
the phone is ringing and her sister-in-law just dropped by.

 &HT;    X-ray body search invades passenger privacy, critics say
 &HT;    By Ismail Turay Jr.
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The U.S. Customs Service is fielding complaints about
its new BodySearch security system, which critics say invades air
travelers' privacy by revealing ``every curve of your naked body
right through your clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can be exposed like a Playboy playmate by these new
voyeur-vision devices, even when you are fully clothed,'' said
Libertarian Party national director Steve Dasbach.
</P>
<P>
   The $125,000 BodySearch system uses very low doses of X-ray
energy to scan and display an image of the traveler's body on a
screen. Hidden drugs, currency, explosives and firearms _ even
plastic weapons _ can then be identified. It is manufactured by
American Science and Engineering Inc. of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The Customs Service introduced the system a few months ago and
is using it at six major airports _ Atlanta, Chicago, Houston, Los
Angeles, Miami and New York's Kennedy International. Plans call for
13 airports to be equipped, with two more systems to be installed
by March at Washington's Dulles International and Newark
International, said Customs spokesman Dennis Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said he has heard of no complaints from international
passengers at Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport.
Passengers to be searched can either accept a hand-search or the
new scan.
</P>
<P>
   Most opt for the hand search, citing time factors, Murphy said.
A hand-search takes about two minutes, but the scan takes from five
to 10 minutes because Customs agents explain the system first. One
in 1,400 passengers undergo body searches during a year, Murphy
said.
</P>
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union has asked the U.S. Department
of Transportation and Federal Aviation Administration to prohibit
the use of the new machines, said legislative counsel Gregory T.
Nojeim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since airport officials don't need a search warrant to use
these X-rated X-rays, everyone from your teen-age daughter to your
grandmother can be technologically stripped stark naked _ in stark
violation of their right to privacy,'' said Dasbach of the
Libertarian Party.
</P>
<P>
   Customs officials say the complaints are being blown out of
proportion. Murphy said the BodySearch is in a private area of the
airport, and trained customs officials who view the images are of
the same sex as those who are being scanned.
</P>
<P>
   He added that Customs decided to use the device because in the
past, officials were forced to touch sensitive parts of people's
anatomy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What (the BodySearch) does is alleviate the need for us to
touch people, because people don't like to touched, and we don't
blame them, because our inspectors also feel uncomfortable touching
people,'' Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the machine has the ability to record and print
images, Murphy said Customs only prints the images if they show
hidden objects. Printed images are used as evidence in court.
</P>
<P>
   Air travelers arriving in the United States are searched only
when an inspector has ``good'' reason to suspect that a passenger
is carrying contraband, Murphy said. He said that on average, 15
passengers from a flight carrying 300 are subjected to body or
luggage searches.
</P>
<P>
   Since the project began, 984 body searches were conducted at the
six airports, but only 133 passengers accepted the scans, Murphy
said. In Atlanta, 25 body searches were done during that time, with
three travelers choosing the scan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of the 25 searched, 13 had drugs on them,'' Murphy said. ``The
three scans were negative.''
</P>
<P>
   Suspicious passengers are taken to a secluded area and are given
the option of being scanned or undergoing a physical pat-down.
</P>
<P>
   According to officials at Chicago O'Hare, not many people have
opted to be scanned. Spokeswoman Sherese Miles said that since the
BodySearch was installed at the airport in November, only nine
passengers have been scanned.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Nojeim said Customs needs to find better methods of
detecting drug smugglers and terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The choice between a pat-down search and an electronic strip
search is no real answer,'' he said. ``Both involve an unreasonable
affront to the dignity of the passengers. These machines conduct
electronic strip searches of passengers, even though there is
little or no evidence that they are engaged in crime.''

   US-MIDEAST-$ADV17 _ WASHINGTON _ Momentum builds this week on
President Clinton's crusade to broker a comprehensive Mideast peace
accord before leaving office in a year. Clinton will host Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk Sharaa
for a second round of negotiations beginning Wednesday; the next

amid talk of a Barak-Arafat peace summit under White House auspices
in the weeks ahead. (Deans, Cox News Service) MOVED SATURDAY

   KOSOVO-REFUGEES _ ATLANTA _ If, for a fleeting moment, they feel
more like hostages than refugees, they need only remember what
landed them in this poor southeast Atlanta neighborhood between a
prison and a junkyard. Hate. Oppression. War. Now, husbands are off
to work, children at school, older sons and daughters out getting
drivers' licenses, or at jobs or looking for jobs, and the Kosovar
women stay behind. Pounding bread dough on the kitchen table,
washing socks in the bathtub, listening to TV shows they can't
really follow. Most hesitate to leave their modest apartments and
venture into their neighborhood, because of their limited English
and fear for their safety. Still, life is ordinary. Life is good.

   BUSH-GAYS _ As the GOP presidential front-runner preaching
compassionate conservatism, Texas Gov. George W. Bush is reaching
out to various traditionally Democratic constituencies, including
African-Americans and Hispanics. But gays are not on the list.
Despite his soft rhetoric on gay issues compared to other
Republicans (he says he's a ``don't ask, don't tell man'' and
refuses to say he'd use sexual orientation as a litmus test for his
appointees), Bush's record in Texas is anti-gay. He opposed a hate
crimes bill that would include gays, he opposes same-sex marriage
and supported a bill banning adoptions by gays. (Greenberger,

<P>
   Here are Anne Stephenson's  &UR; NEW &AMP; NOTABLE capsule book reviews:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; ``YUKON ALONE'' &QL; 
 &UR; By John Balzar (Holt, $25) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New &AMP; Notable is a sucker for adventure stories, particularly _
given a certain publishing orgy of late _ any story that does not
take place on Mount Everest or involve bodies that will never be
found. We were happy to discover that the Yukon can be just as cold
as Everest and is not nearly so trendy. In fact, the sled dog race
called the Yukon Quest was established 15 years ago by traditional
mushers in answer to the increasingly chic Iditarod, which has
given rise to competitors (Balzar calls them ``big names in dog
mushing'') who dress like race-car drivers and have dog handlers in
matching uniforms. Not so the mushers of the Quest. They are an
odd, scruffy lot, and their race is an odd, lonely ordeal: 1,023
miles from Canada's Yukon Territory to Fairbanks, Alaska, in the
long darkness of February. Balzar spent months among these people
to profile the 1998 Quest for the ``Los Angeles Times.'' His book
is about a place where priorities are different and life is
demanding, and both are what you make of them. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``SUNDANCING'' &QL; 
By John Anderson (Spike, $12.50) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is a behind-the-scenes story of the Sundance Film Festival,
and it isn't pretty. It is crowded, commercial, competitive and
very, very important to the independent filmmakers who come to
Sundance like pilgrims to a glitzy, overproduced mecca of their
dreams. They come in search of success, something that became
associated with Sundance after 1989, when Steven Soderberg's film
``sex, lies and videotape'' changed the face of both the festival
and the independent film itself. Anderson, film critic for
``Newsday,'' went to Sundance last year and spent lots of time
listening to people talk about it _ everyone from actors, writers
and directors to journalists, publicists and even a police officer
who impounded Clint Eastwood's car (``He was very personable, a
very nice person to visit with. He had his picture taken with us
and seemed to be enjoying himself.''). We must make do with the
implied presence of Robert Redford, whose reticence is notorious
and who is, one director says, like a ``phantom'' at his own
festival. Not surprisingly, he and the Sundance Institute declined
to be involved with this book. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``MONSTER'' &QL; 
By Jonathan Kellerman (Random House, $25.95) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kellerman is a psychologist. That gives him the upper hand in
this thriller, which begins in the exercise yard of a hospital for
the criminally insane. Kellerman's recurring character, Alex
Delaware, himself a psychologist, has come with Detective Milo
Sturgis to search for clues in the brutal slaying of Dr. Claire
Argent, who worked among the strange and frightening inmates of the
hospital. These men are incarcerated for life, having killed people
for no logical reason and with particularly disgusting and
blood-splattering abandon. How then could one of them have been
involved in a murder that occurred on the outside? You begin to
suspect the answer to this question around about Page 79, but then
suspense is not the strong suit of this book. That honor belongs to
its portrayal of these seriously dangerous men, their taste for
violence and their relationships with the people who treat them.
Delaware and Sturgis discover that Argent's murder has roots in a
dreadful crime committed nearly two decades earlier. We relive
every gory detail of it and more. Enjoy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``LIFE STORIES'' &QL; 
Edited by David Remnick (Random House, $26.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Light the candles, practice the song, the ``New Yorker'' is 75
and Remnick wants you to make a fuss. By way of encouragement, he
has edited two delectable volumes. This is a collection of
profiles, biographical pieces for which the magazine is justly
famous. Included, among others, are Lillian Ross' look at Ernest
Hemingway, Truman Capote on Marlon Brando, Roger Angell on
baseball's Steve Blass, Calvin Trillin on Edna Buchanan, Henry
Louis Gates Jr. on Anatole Broyard, A.J. Liebling on Floyd
Patterson, and Susan Orlean's hilarious profile of a show dog
called Biff Truesdale. Remnick's second offering is ``Wonderful
Town'' (Random House, $26.95), a collection of short stories set in
New York and published over the years in the ``New Yorker.'' A
partial list of contributors: Philip Roth, Woody Allen, James
Thurber, John Cheever, John O'Hara, Deborah Eisenberg, John Updike,
Dorothy Parker, William Maxwell, E.B. White, Saul Bellow, S.J.
Perelman, Vladimir Nabokov, Lorrie Moore . . . we could go on and
on. Excuse us while we locate our matches and don our paper hats. &QL;

THE VIRTUOUS LIFE, WITHOUT THE RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (EDITORS: STORY ALSO MOVING IN THE ``L'' CATEGORY) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I don't like Bill Bennett. I think he is a very unpleasant man.
In fact, every time I see the former education secretary and ``drug
czar'' on ``Face the Nation'' or ``Larry King Live,'' his smug,
unctuous face makes my blood boil.
</P>
<P>
   There are few faces that scream out louder: sanctimonious prig.
</P>
<P>
   He makes his pronouncements about cultural values with an
insulting certainty, speaking as if he had personally been up on
Mount Sinai getting the tablets from Jehovah. His dicta are as
irritating as those of any name dropper. And if the name he drops
is God's, it is all the more obnoxious.
</P>
<P>
   It is his certainty that bugs me more than anything else. It is
a quality that inhabits a certain kind of male: A certainty that
whatever position he takes is the true one, simply by virtue of his
taking it. It is a very male thing, and reminds me once again that
testosterone is a hallucinogen.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons he makes me so angry is that the cause he has
latched onto is an important one. Our values need to be discussed.
</P>
<P>
   But his version of them is deeply distorted by that inflexible
certainty.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett knows what the virtues are we should maintain: He has
made a list. In his ``Book of Virtues,'' he includes self
discipline, compassion, responsibility , friendship, work, courage,
perseverance, honesty, loyalty and faith.
</P>
<P>
   It seems a measure of Bennett that humility is not among these
virtues.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these seem obvious and inarguable. Others less so. And
in reality, such categorical expectations cannot be convincingly
maintained. There are times when loyalty conflicts with honesty,
times when faith conflicts with compassion. If you are a Sufi
mystic, self discipline may be just the opposite of what you
require. Perseverance is sometimes merely stupidity. Sometimes
diplomacy outranks honesty, for the good of all.
</P>
<P>
   And work, as Bennett outlines it, smells suspiciously of the
Victorian principle espoused by such moralists as Andrew Carnegie
and Henry Ford, who made millions because other people worked long
virtuous hours.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the opposite is truly the virtue. At least Henry Thoreau
made a convincing case in ``Walden.'' ``We are made to exaggerate
the importance of what work we do,'' he wrote. ``But men labor
under a mistake. The better part of the man is soon plowed into the
soil for compost.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans already work like dogs. It is the quality of their
leisure that needs improving.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not the individual virtues on Bennett's list that I
take exception to, but the list itself.
</P>
<P>
   For too often, we think of virtues as being something as simple
as a list: A series of words.
</P>
<P>
   Virtue, for Bennett in his book, ``involves rules and precepts _
the dos and don'ts of life with others.'' In other words, we are
good because we do what we are told.
</P>
<P>
   He reiterates his position in his followup book, ``The Moral
Compass,'' by asserting, ``Moral education must involve following
rules of good behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, virtue is etiquette.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I find this view trivializing, and worse, I suspect
that it is propounded merely to perpetuate an economic and
governing system that makes it possible for Bennett and people of
his economic and educational advantage to live comfortable lives.
</P>
<P>
   There are other possible lists of virtues.
</P>
<P>
   The Roman Catholic church lists the Theological Virtues of
Faith, Hope and Charity; the Cardinal Virtues of Prudence, Justice,
Temperance, and Fortitude; and the Evangelical Counsels of Poverty,
Chastity and Obedience.
</P>
<P>
   I doubt Bennett considers poverty a virtue.
</P>
<P>
   Or the list in Laurie Anderson's song, ``Forgetting'':
``Bravery, Kindness, Clarity, Honesty, Compassion, Generosity,
Dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   Of these, Clarity is the least often observed.
</P>
<P>
   But whichever list we observe is ultimately forced upon our
lives in the style of Procrustes. We are not meant to think about
them, but to obey them.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, rules are always insufficient. There are always
circumstances that require our disobeying.
</P>
<P>
   William Blake, for instance, wrote in his ``Marriage of Heaven
and Hell'' how Jesus of Nazareth broke each of the 10 Commandments,
ennumerating them, one by one. Jesus was good, Blake says, because
``Jesus was all virtue, and acted from impulse, not from rules.''
</P>
<P>
   For Blake, Jesus's impulses were good impulses. The rules were
dead and deadening.
</P>
<P>
   He sums it up in one of his ``Proverbs of Hell:'' ``One rule for
the lion and ox is oppression.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Bennett and his followers sum up the good in another phrase
from one of Blake's villains, the shortsighted god, Urizen: ``One
command, one joy, one desire,/ One curse, one weight, one measure,/
One King, one God, one Law.''
</P>
<P>
   As if everyone were a uniform cog in one of Ford's
mass-production lines.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that has happened is a change in the meaning of the
word ``virtue.''
</P>
<P>
   It has meant different things at different times. If it now
means righteous behavior, it once meant something less rigid.
</P>
<P>
   For the Greeks, and later the Romans _ who gave us the word _
virtue meant to be yourself in the utmost. That is, if you were a
soldier, to be brave and fight skillfully; if you were a scholar,
to read deeply and widely.
</P>
<P>
   Each person had his own virtue: to be who he was with every
fiber of his being. Presumably, if you were a villain, you were
virtuous to the extent that you did the most evil.
</P>
<P>
   Ulysses was virtuous for his ability to lie; Achilles for his
ability to kill people.
</P>
<P>
   The best modern equivalent of the term might be
``authenticity.'' Being true to yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtue'' didn't take on its acrid sanctimoniousness until the
Victorian age, when it was used to approve of behavior that
furthered the goals of Colonialism and jingoism.
</P>
<P>
   For the Victorians, virtue meant not having sex. It's a long way
from Achilles to Elsie Dinsmore.
</P>
<P>
   The word ``values,'' that is bandied about so glibly by
politicians now, has also undergone such a change.
</P>
<P>
   It tends to be used by conservative politicians to mean those
narrow and ethnocentric strictures that make life comfortable for
them. ``Values'' means THEIR values. They are something you inject
like a flu shot into your children in hopes it will keep them out
of jail.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there is little that is as basic to our sense of our own
humanity than our values. The question is vitally important.
</P>
<P>
   But before the term was belittled by politicans, our values were
those things we felt had intrinsic worth. They are called values
because we VALUED them; they were things you could count on, like
solid currency. They were not an abstract yardstick to measure
behavior, but rather the very concrete reality on which we built
our lives.
</P>
<P>
   For something to count as a human value, it has, above all, to
be true. Anything else will prove false in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   Our values are those things we take as the rock-bottom basic
truths that experience gives us, that we can count on and therefore
can act in the world with the expectancy that particular behaviors
will result in particular outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, our values are not written down on paper
somewhere, but found in the world around us, the world we
experience, the lives we live. And instead of turning out to be as
vaporous as the words of a list, values are as solid as the oak
tree that grows in the yard. Indeed, they may be the oak tree. Or
the birds roosting in it.
</P>
<P>
   Our values include what we believe our families to be, our
awareness of cause-and-effect in the natural world, our sense of
outrage when injustice is aimed at us _ or at someone we share
sympathy with.
</P>
<P>
   If you live in the American South, whether you are White or
Black, the red dirt is one of your values. If you live in New
Jersey, pizza is part of your value system. These are never merely
words, but the truth of the universe you inhabit, as you are given
the ability to see them.
</P>
<P>
   If a so-called value handed down to us is proven false by
experience, we must either forsake the value or live an inauthentic
life. Many of the values Bennett would foist on us no longer ring
true. Perhaps some still do. But we must find them out for
ourselves. It is one of our life's tasks. &QL;

 &HT;    GORE SETS RACIAL HEALING AS TOP PRIORITY
 &HT;    with GORE Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN, N.H. _ An exhausted Al Gore peered out of his frosted
car window at the darkened, snow-covered mountains of New
Hampshire's frigid North Country.
</P>
<P>
   But the vice president, who had just completed a long day of
campaigning with three hours of questioning by several hundred
residents of this small mill town, quickly warmed to a reporter's
questions on the legacy of the late Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and
his own commitment to improving race relations in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Healing is within our reach,'' Gore told Cox Newspapers as his
motorcade cautiously worked its way along an icy highway through
these mountains late Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   In discussing his scheduled appearance today (Monday) at
Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church to celebrate the national holiday
honoring King, Gore vowed that if he is elected president there
will be ``no higher priority'' in his administration than promoting
that healing.
</P>
<P>
   During his visit to Atlanta, Gore will unveil administration
plans to seek $1.5 million in new federal funding to help preserve
the King birthplace and burial site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an important part of America's heritage and history and
has educational and inspirational power to pass on to each new
generation lessons about the life of Dr. King and the message of
Dr. King,'' Gore said of the preservation effort.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the passing of more than three decades since his
assassination, King's message is ``as powerful as ever and needs to
be heard now more than ever before,'' the vice president said.
</P>
<P>
   Why now?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because healing is within our reach and because the rest of
the world is in a transformative process with so many other peoples
looking to the United States for signs of hope that they can
transcend racial and ethnic and religious differences and embrace
the highest common denominator of the human spirit,'' he responded.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said President Clinton's race initiative, a year-long
``national conversation'' focusing on racial reconciliation efforts
in local communities, was ``a good beginning.'' He said that, ``if
entrusted with the presidency,'' he would continue that effort,
though ``not exactly in the same form.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Gore also said:
</P>
<P>
   It is ``unfair'' for Bill Bradley, his rival for the Democratic
presidential nomination, to accuse him of racial politics in the
1988 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   It is ``just indefensible'' for the Confederate flag to fly atop
any public building.
</P>
<P>
   Although was ``deeply offended'' by recent comments of Atlanta
Braves pitcher John Rocker about minorities, gays and foreigners,
Rocker still has a chance to ``kind of turn this thing around''
with people like Andrew Young and Hank Aaron on his side.
</P>
<P>
   Affirmative action programs will ``stand the test of the fair
judgment of the American people'' in the upcoming presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
   Former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Colin Powell has ``earned
the right'' to not be held ``personally accountable'' for
Republican Party ``shortcomings'' on race-related matters.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's vow to use the bully pulpit of the White House to ``bring
our people together'' comes in the wake of recent accusations that
his past and present pursuits of the Democratic Party's
presidential nomination have involved racial demagoguery.
</P>
<P>
   The latest occurred just days ago when Bradley , Gore's sole
opponent in the primaries, charged that Gore is responsible for
first interjecting Willie Horton into the national political
consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was misleading and unfair,'' Gore said of Bradley's charges
about Horton, a black Massachusetts prisoner who became a symbol of
racial politics 12 years ago in then-Vice President George Bush's
campaign against Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
   Horton was among the violent offenders who were furloughed under
a program initiated by Dukakis as governor of Massachusetts in the
1980s. During the furlough, Horton committed rape.
</P>
<P>
   During a 19888 debate, Gore criticized the furlough program. But
he never mentioned Horton or his race. In fact, ``I didn't know his
name,'' Gore said during the interview. ``I talked about the
program as a whole without reference to race in any way, shape or
form.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's campaign manager, the late Lee Atwater, vowed before
the 1988 general election to ``make Willie Horton Michael Dukakis's
running mate.'' And GOP activists subsequently ran television ads
critical of Dukakis that featured Horton's threatening police mug
shot.
</P>
<P>
   Dukakis has come to Gore's defense by chastising Bradley for
asserting that Gore was to blame for Horton's emergence in the 1988
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``To suggest that Al Gore was responsible for this is not only
wrong but quite unfair,'' Dukakis said. ``The guy who's responsible
for it was George Bush, and we all know what he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also has come under fire from Powell, the former chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, for recent comments by Gore campaign
manager Donna Brazile accusing the Republican Party of racial
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Powell accused Brazile, who is also black, of playing ``the race
card'' by saying Republicans would rather have their pictures taken
with black children than feed them.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore, when asked if Powell should be called upon to defend
the GOP's positions on racial matters, said the general has
``earned the right to focus on his 'America's Challenge' program,''
which promotes volunteerism.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Powell has already ``expressed enough disagreement
with some of the policies of his party,'' specifically, its
opposition to affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   `` I don't feel the need to try to make him a spokesman for the
shortcomings of the Republican Party,'' Gore said of Powell. ``I
think he is a great man. I disagree with his membership in the
Republican Party, but I think he has a right to do that without
being held personally accountable for all the mistakes that they
make.''

THE VIRTUOUS LIFE, WITHOUT THE RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (EDITORS: STORY ALSO MOVING IN THE ``K'' CATEGORY) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I don't like Bill Bennett. I think he is a very unpleasant man.
In fact, every time I see the former education secretary and ``drug
czar'' on ``Face the Nation'' or ``Larry King Live,'' his smug,
unctuous face makes my blood boil.
</P>
<P>
   There are few faces that scream out louder: sanctimonious prig.
</P>
<P>
   He makes his pronouncements about cultural values with an
insulting certainty, speaking as if he had personally been up on
Mount Sinai getting the tablets from Jehovah. His dicta are as
irritating as those of any name dropper. And if the name he drops
is God's, it is all the more obnoxious.
</P>
<P>
   It is his certainty that bugs me more than anything else. It is
a quality that inhabits a certain kind of male: A certainty that
whatever position he takes is the true one, simply by virtue of his
taking it. It is a very male thing, and reminds me once again that
testosterone is a hallucinogen.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons he makes me so angry is that the cause he has
latched onto is an important one. Our values need to be discussed.
</P>
<P>
   But his version of them is deeply distorted by that inflexible
certainty.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett knows what the virtues are we should maintain: He has
made a list. In his ``Book of Virtues,'' he includes self
discipline, compassion, responsibility , friendship, work, courage,
perseverance, honesty, loyalty and faith.
</P>
<P>
   It seems a measure of Bennett that humility is not among these
virtues.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these seem obvious and inarguable. Others less so. And
in reality, such categorical expectations cannot be convincingly
maintained. There are times when loyalty conflicts with honesty,
times when faith conflicts with compassion. If you are a Sufi
mystic, self discipline may be just the opposite of what you
require. Perseverance is sometimes merely stupidity. Sometimes
diplomacy outranks honesty, for the good of all.
</P>
<P>
   And work, as Bennett outlines it, smells suspiciously of the
Victorian principle espoused by such moralists as Andrew Carnegie
and Henry Ford, who made millions because other people worked long
virtuous hours.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the opposite is truly the virtue. At least Henry Thoreau
made a convincing case in ``Walden.'' ``We are made to exaggerate
the importance of what work we do,'' he wrote. ``But men labor
under a mistake. The better part of the man is soon plowed into the
soil for compost.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans already work like dogs. It is the quality of their
leisure that needs improving.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not the individual virtues on Bennett's list that I
take exception to, but the list itself.
</P>
<P>
   For too often, we think of virtues as being something as simple
as a list: A series of words.
</P>
<P>
   Virtue, for Bennett in his book, ``involves rules and precepts _
the dos and don'ts of life with others.'' In other words, we are
good because we do what we are told.
</P>
<P>
   He reiterates his position in his followup book, ``The Moral
Compass,'' by asserting, ``Moral education must involve following
rules of good behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, virtue is etiquette.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I find this view trivializing, and worse, I suspect
that it is propounded merely to perpetuate an economic and
governing system that makes it possible for Bennett and people of
his economic and educational advantage to live comfortable lives.
</P>
<P>
   There are other possible lists of virtues.
</P>
<P>
   The Roman Catholic church lists the Theological Virtues of
Faith, Hope and Charity; the Cardinal Virtues of Prudence, Justice,
Temperance, and Fortitude; and the Evangelical Counsels of Poverty,
Chastity and Obedience.
</P>
<P>
   I doubt Bennett considers poverty a virtue.
</P>
<P>
   Or the list in Laurie Anderson's song, ``Forgetting'':
``Bravery, Kindness, Clarity, Honesty, Compassion, Generosity,
Dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   Of these, Clarity is the least often observed.
</P>
<P>
   But whichever list we observe is ultimately forced upon our
lives in the style of Procrustes. We are not meant to think about
them, but to obey them.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, rules are always insufficient. There are always
circumstances that require our disobeying.
</P>
<P>
   William Blake, for instance, wrote in his ``Marriage of Heaven
and Hell'' how Jesus of Nazareth broke each of the 10 Commandments,
ennumerating them, one by one. Jesus was good, Blake says, because
``Jesus was all virtue, and acted from impulse, not from rules.''
</P>
<P>
   For Blake, Jesus's impulses were good impulses. The rules were
dead and deadening.
</P>
<P>
   He sums it up in one of his ``Proverbs of Hell:'' ``One rule for
the lion and ox is oppression.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Bennett and his followers sum up the good in another phrase
from one of Blake's villains, the shortsighted god, Urizen: ``One
command, one joy, one desire,/ One curse, one weight, one measure,/
One King, one God, one Law.''
</P>
<P>
   As if everyone were a uniform cog in one of Ford's
mass-production lines.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that has happened is a change in the meaning of the
word ``virtue.''
</P>
<P>
   It has meant different things at different times. If it now
means righteous behavior, it once meant something less rigid.
</P>
<P>
   For the Greeks, and later the Romans _ who gave us the word _
virtue meant to be yourself in the utmost. That is, if you were a
soldier, to be brave and fight skillfully; if you were a scholar,
to read deeply and widely.
</P>
<P>
   Each person had his own virtue: to be who he was with every
fiber of his being. Presumably, if you were a villain, you were
virtuous to the extent that you did the most evil.
</P>
<P>
   Ulysses was virtuous for his ability to lie; Achilles for his
ability to kill people.
</P>
<P>
   The best modern equivalent of the term might be
``authenticity.'' Being true to yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtue'' didn't take on its acrid sanctimoniousness until the
Victorian age, when it was used to approve of behavior that
furthered the goals of Colonialism and jingoism.
</P>
<P>
   For the Victorians, virtue meant not having sex. It's a long way
from Achilles to Elsie Dinsmore.
</P>
<P>
   The word ``values,'' that is bandied about so glibly by
politicians now, has also undergone such a change.
</P>
<P>
   It tends to be used by conservative politicians to mean those
narrow and ethnocentric strictures that make life comfortable for
them. ``Values'' means THEIR values. They are something you inject
like a flu shot into your children in hopes it will keep them out
of jail.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there is little that is as basic to our sense of our own
humanity than our values. The question is vitally important.
</P>
<P>
   But before the term was belittled by politicans, our values were
those things we felt had intrinsic worth. They are called values
because we VALUED them; they were things you could count on, like
solid currency. They were not an abstract yardstick to measure
behavior, but rather the very concrete reality on which we built
our lives.
</P>
<P>
   For something to count as a human value, it has, above all, to
be true. Anything else will prove false in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   Our values are those things we take as the rock-bottom basic
truths that experience gives us, that we can count on and therefore
can act in the world with the expectancy that particular behaviors
will result in particular outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, our values are not written down on paper
somewhere, but found in the world around us, the world we
experience, the lives we live. And instead of turning out to be as
vaporous as the words of a list, values are as solid as the oak
tree that grows in the yard. Indeed, they may be the oak tree. Or
the birds roosting in it.
</P>
<P>
   Our values include what we believe our families to be, our
awareness of cause-and-effect in the natural world, our sense of
outrage when injustice is aimed at us _ or at someone we share
sympathy with.
</P>
<P>
   If you live in the American South, whether you are White or
Black, the red dirt is one of your values. If you live in New
Jersey, pizza is part of your value system. These are never merely
words, but the truth of the universe you inhabit, as you are given
the ability to see them.
</P>
<P>
   If a so-called value handed down to us is proven false by
experience, we must either forsake the value or live an inauthentic
life. Many of the values Bennett would foist on us no longer ring
true. Perhaps some still do. But we must find them out for
ourselves. It is one of our life's tasks. &QL;

 ``THE LAST DANCE: A NOVEL  OF THE 87TH PRECINCT'' 
 By Ed McBain  (Simon &AMP; Schuster, Inc. $25.00) 
 
 By THOMAS ROPP  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Evan Hunter is Ed McBain.
</P>
<P>
   He's also been Richard Marsten, Curt Cannon, Hunt Collins and
Ezra Hannon.
</P>
<P>
   He was born Salvatore A. Lombino. With his father's blessings,
he legally changed his birth name to Hunter when he began to
publish in the early '50s because at that time there was still much
bigotry against Italian-Americans and it extended to publishing.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, Hunter's multiple-name reality is like his layered
career. Under the tutelage of literary agent Scott Meredith, he
sold feverishly to the pulp magazines. Later, he hooked up with
film director Alfred Hitchcock and wrote the screenplay for ``The
Birds.'' But he really wasn't a screenplay writer, nor a
pulp-fiction hack. Hunter knew characterization as well as
brainless action.
</P>
<P>
   In 1956, ``Cop Hater'' appeared, the first of more than
four-dozen titles in his bestselling 87th Precinct series.
Featuring Detective Steve Carella (who serves most often as the
author's alter ego), Hunter created an ensemble of characters who
deftly moved in and out of conflict against the backdrop of Isola,
a fictitious megacity that even the most dense readers understand
is Hunter's New York City.
</P>
<P>
   He penned the series with the name Ed McBain. It's the name most
of the world knows him by today because the 87th Precinct was no
ordinary, genre crime fiction. There was a poetry and incisiveness
to the writing that inspired a whole generation of writers and
producers, including those of the enormously popular cop shows
``Hill Street Blues,'' ``NYPD Blue'' and ``Homicide.''
</P>
<P>
   Some would argue that what Hunter writes in his straight novels
(he wrote ``The Blackboard Jungle'' and ``Sons'')``'' as well as in
crime fiction is nothing less than literature, although the
literary community has never embraced him.
</P>
<P>
   In a phone interview from his new home in Connecticut, Hunter
said he's passed the stage of worrying about critics and those who
anoint fiction as literature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt early on in my career that I was going to take all the
prizes,'' Hunter said. ``Now I know I'm not going to get the
Pulitzer or the Nobel.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Hunter will be in town at The Poisoned Pen in
Scottsdale for the signing of his newly released ``The Last Dance''
(Simon &AMP; Schuster, $25), the 50th float in the 87th Precinct
parade.
</P>
<P>
   This one is a winner, too, perhaps even more hard-edged and
suspenseful than the series average. What starts out as an apparent
suicide by hanging evolves into a gritty homicide over copyrights
for a major musical production.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter said his inspiration came from a musical that he has been
working on over the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``That, and copyright, was much on my mind,'' Hunter said. ``I'm
a writer, and copyright is the only thing of value that any writer
has in the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter is now 73 years old, but his voice has the mellifluous
lilt and mischievous energy of a man half his age.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really do feel great,'' Hunter said. ``You know, inside
every 70-year-old fat lady crossing the street and dodging a bus
there's a 16-year-old kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter said a typical day is waking at 8, hitting the treadmill
for an hour while watching the morning news, then breakfast, then
heading off to his in-home office where he writes from 10 till 6,
breaking only for lunch with his wife, Dragica. He said that when
he first began writing, he logged many more hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``I vowed if I was ever able to make a living writing, I'd never
work at night or on the weekends again,'' Hunter said. ``I lock
that studio door at six and won't go back in no matter what sirens
I hear beckoning.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was concerned with studies that suggest readers are
disappearing, he replied, ``I'm more concerned that writers are
disappearing.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he can't recommend any up-and-coming crime-fiction
writers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the title of his latest work, Hunter said it will not be
his last 87th Precinct novel. He plans on calling that one
``Exit,'' to be published after he passes on to that big substation
in the sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I haven't written it yet,'' Hunter said. ``I have a 100
more titles crowding my head, and I can't wait to start writing
them all.''  &QL;

   Here is a complete a transcript of an interview with Vice
President Al Gore on Saturday, January 15:
</P>
<P>
   in Berlin, N.H. with Scott Shepard of the Cox Washington Bureau:
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why do you think this new involvement of the federal
government in preserving Dr. Martin Luther King's birthplace and
burial site is necessary?
</P>
<P>
   A. It's an important part of America's heritage and history and
has educational and inspirational power to pass on to each new
generation lessons about the life of Dr. King and the message of
Dr. King - a message that is as powerful as ever and needs to be
heard now more than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why now?
</P>
<P>
   A. Because healing is within our reach and because the rest of
the world is in a transformative process with so many other peoples
looking to the United States for signs of hope that they can
transcend racial and ethnic and religious differences and embrace
the highest common denominator of the human spirit. And Dr. King
embodied that fundamentally American message and unlocked more of
the American potential for insuring that we have harmony and
diversity and that we are true to our own highest ideals.
</P>
<P>
   Q. The last time the federal government got involved in a
project related to Dr. King, it was the Park Service's plan to
build a welcome center in the King Historic District. That led to a
conflict with the King family and, since then, has sparked some
debate over whether the King family is trying to profit
commercially from Dr. King's legacy. Do you have any concern that
this will be repeated?
</P>
<P>
   A. I know of no reason to feel that the resolution sometime back
hasn't been acceptable to both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You remarked today that as a youth you were excited by the
civil rights movement in the 1960s. What did you mean?
</P>
<P>
   A. I said it embraced my hopes and inspired me. I think that's
true of so many in my generation because a young person who sees
clear injustice and feels the tides of battle in the struggle
against injustice is naturally drawn toward that struggle.
</P>
<P>
   My generation growing up in the 1950s in the New South - of
course I was raised in two places but always identified with the
New South - it was quite dramatic feeling the clear distinction
between right and wrong as the struggle was playing out in the
public arena - hearing some older members of the communities where
we lived attempting to justify the unjustifiable.
</P>
<P>
   My father was a hero to me in having the courage to be on the
right side of most of those questions. But there's no doubt that in
many parts of the South young people saw more clearly than their
elders and felt the essential justice of Dr. King's cause more
easily than an older generation still struggling with the residue
of prejudice from the past. To see so clearly and to feel so
intensely and to have the hope that justice was within reach, that
was thrilling.
</P>
<P>
   Q. People generally agree that President Clinton has a very
strong core commitment to improving race relations in the United
States and, for that reason, started his race initiative. Do you
think that accomplished as much as it could have or did it fall
victim to the impeachment process?
</P>
<P>
   A. I think it was a good beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you continue it, if you are president?
</P>
<P>
   A. Not in exactly the same form. But yes, any president who does
the job well will wage a constant battle to bring our people
together. And if I'm entrusted with the presidency, I will have no
higher priority.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What was your first personal encounter with racism?
</P>
<P>
   A. When I was very young, I don't even know how young, three or
four, we used to drive back and forth from Carthage, Tenn., to
Washington, D.C. We would make that four, five, six times a year.
When my sister and I were little, my mother had an African American
woman who worked for her and helped take care of us. She would make
the trip with us, all of us in the car.
</P>
<P>
   I remember when we were not able to stop at some places because
she couldn't be served. We couldn't stay overnight at some places
because she would not be allowed to stay. What I remember most
about it was the conversations between my mother and father about
it and this fine woman who was such an important part of my
childhood.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Where were you when you heard the news of Dr. King's
assassination?
</P>
<P>
   A. We were driving a car from Boston to Washington on spring
break and we heard the news on the car radio. We got to Washington
and I remember going to pick up my mother downtown at a store and
people were crashing in the plate glass windows along the sidewalk
and I went in to get her and got her into the car and drove her
home.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Last fall, you spoke from the same pulpit where Dr. King
delivered his last sermon before his assassination. Monday you will
be speaking from his pulpit at Ebenezer Baptist Church. How does
that feel to stand in places like that?
</P>
<P>
   A. It's humbling to know that no matter how hard you work to
prepare the speech you'll never have even the one one-thousandth of
the eloquence that Dr. King brought to that place. So it's a truly
humbling experience in that sense. But it's an honor to be able to
speak from a place where he stood, of course. And it gives you an
extra desire to say something that will push the limits of what you
are able to say.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What do you think when you see the Confederate flag?
</P>
<P>
   A. I see the pain that it's causing some of my fellow Americans
who interpret it as a hateful reminder of cruel theories of racial
superiority and misguided determination to hold fast to an ideology
of discrimination. I know that there are some who display it who
have a mix of other intentions. But I also know that some who
display it mean to convey exactly the message that is painfully
received by many, especially African Americans. I just think there
is no excuse for having it atop a public building that is supposed
to open and accommodating to all citizens without trace of
prejudice or discrimination. It's just indefensible.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How did you feel this week about Sen. Bradley blaming you for
injecting Willie Horton into the 1988 presidential campaign against
Michael Dukakis?
</P>
<P>
   A. I didn't even mention his name. I didn't know his name, to
tell you the truth. I raised the policy issue. What I said was 11
convicted murderers who were given a furlough decided that the two
week passes weren't enough for them and so they left and never came
back and two of them committed other murders and I didn't think
that was a great idea. And I asked (Dukakis), 'didn't you make a
mistake there?' Basically, that was the question. I never mentioned
the name of the prisoner. I didn't even single out an individual
case. I talked about the program as a whole without reference to
race in any way, shape or form. As Mike Dukakis said in response to
Sen. Bradley this week, that was just misleading and unfair.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you feel that way, too?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, I think it was misleading and unfair.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why do you think he did it?
</P>
<P>
   A. You would have to ask him that.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Colin Powell recently objected to the comments of your
campaign manager (Donna Brazile) about how the Republican Party
uses prominent African Americans for publicity but does little in
terms of policy to help African Americans. Why didn't you or any
other Democrat use the occasion to challenge Colin Powell to defend
his party's record on race?
</P>
<P>
   A. I think he has earned the right to focus on his America's
Challenge program and he's expressed enough disagreement with some
of the policies of his party in the past that I don't feel the need
to try to make him a spokesman for the shortcomings of the
Republican Party. I think he is a great man. I disagree with his
membership in the Republican Party, but I think he has a right to
do that without being held personally accountable for all the
mistakes that they make.
</P>
<P>
   Q. One obvious disagreement is affirmative action, which raises
the question: How much of an issue will that be in the general
election?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't know. I support it, as you know. And I think the case
is overwhelming for why it's still needed. But there's no doubt
it's controversial. And the Republicans have signaled that they
intend to make it an issue. But that's all right. We ought to be
able to defend and debate tough issues. If they're really in the
best interest of the country, and I'm convinced they are, they'll
stand the test of the fair judgement of the American people.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What about the controversy over (Atlanta Braves pitcher) John
Rocker?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't know him and I don't have a basis for making a
personal judgment. I was deeply offended by his comments. But I
have a great deal of respect for Andy Young and Hank Aaron. And I
was impressed with the conclusion drawn by the two of them. And I
would say that if he does more convincing of people like that, then
he's got a chance to kind of turn this around.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Does this incident reflect anything about our society as a
whole?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes. It reflects the basic belief that America is all about
redemption.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Many readers of this article, particularly those at midlife or
younger, probably expect to live through a good half or more of the
new century.
</P>
<P>
   What they may not be counting on, however, is the speed of
medical progress:
</P>
<P>
   Some people who are middle age today, right now, may well live
through the entire &QC; 
21st century and may be reading another article like this 100 years
from now.
</P>
<P>
   The average lifespan was 47 years when the 20th century began.
It is now 76 years, thanks to public health improvements,
antibiotics, vaccinations, heart surgery, cancer treatments and
other breakthroughs. Some scientists say the American lifespan
could double by the end of the century, thanks to fundamental
tinkering with the root causes of aging and disease.
</P>
<P>
   A world of 150-year-olds doesn't mean a world of tottering
frailty: Extended longevity will be the result of robust health,
extending well into the ninth decade of life and beyond. Retirement
will be a quaint notion, some say, as might retirement communities.
</P>
<P>
   There are an estimated 70,000 Americans who are 100 years old or
older. That number has tripled since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   (In Arizona, there are about 500 centenarians, some keeping
schedules that would put 30-year-olds to shame _ such as former
state Rep. Polly Rosenbaum of Globe and Phoenix, who turned 100 in
September.
</P>
<P>
   Based on current medical science and not allowing for any
advances, the number of Arizonans ages 85 and older is expected to
increase to 455,831 in 2050 from 83,381 in 2000.) If this all seems
like an extended pre-death limbo that you're really not looking
forward to, be cheered by the probability that, in this coming
``I'm Dick Clark, You're Dick Clark'' era, things such as wrinkles,
gray hair, old skin, old muscles, old brain cells, old eyes, old
spouses and poor memories could be things you get fixed at the spa
with pills, creams, injections and flavored sorbets.
</P>
<P>
   Although all that may sound like science fiction, there is some
science making some of it likely.
</P>
<P>
   As a new century begins, scientists studying aging are
cautiously optimistic about making major progress soon in
addressing the cause of aging and the diseases associated with
aging. They have had astonishing success in recent years in
increasing the lifespans of laboratory species such as worms and
fruit flies. Genetic advances also offer tremendous potential.
</P>
<P>
   Although some on the fringe of the scientific world are
predicting lifespans of 200 or more within the next 50 years, most
of those doing the more serious aging research _ people who can't
afford to be quoted on the cover of the ``National Enquirer'' _
aren't saying they agree or disagree.
</P>
<P>
   When pressed, however, they are beginning to say fairly amazing
things.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hunch is that there's a 75 percent chance that someone born
today will live to be 150,'' said Steve Austad, a University of
Idaho biologist specializing in aging and the author of ``Why We
Age.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it at a meeting of eminent academic researchers on aging
who gathered last year at the University of California School of
Medicine at Los Angeles to talk about some of the likely advances
in the next 10 to 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   And at that same meeting, the previously unspeakable was spoken:
``Over the next couple of decades, we will be able to unravel the
mechanism of aging,'' said Cynthia Kenyon, a professor of
biochemistry and biophysics at the University of California-San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   They noted that with just a few genetic alterations, scientists
have created worms and fruit flies that have lifespans twice the
norm and that die healthy and vigorous _ the worm or fly equivalent
of being 90 and looking 45. Even mice have lived 40 to 60 percent
longer than normal with a simple genetic tweak. Once more is known
about why and how we age, then the work of delaying it could begin.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   INCREMENTAL INCREASES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Judith Campisi of the Berkeley National Laboratory at the
University of California-Berkeley, one of the leading experts on
cancer and aging, sees average lifespans increasing in increments,
as the diseases that kill us are eliminated. She isn't about to
predict future lifespans, however. If she underguesses, she'll live
to regret it.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't exactly throw cold water on the happy talk, however:
``I expect we will be able to ameliorate and perhaps reverse some
of the disabling conditions that plague the last decade or so of
human life.''
</P>
<P>
   Stem cell research in particular, she said, offers the potential
replenishment of cells lost due to aging, trauma or disease.
</P>
<P>
   Most age researchers are more excited about quality of life than
quantity of years.
</P>
<P>
   ``What many people don't realize is that we are talking about
having 90-year-olds who are as functional as 50-year-olds,'' said
Kenyon, of UCSF.
</P>
<P>
   Quality of life may be safer to talk about because the culture
may not be ready for the idea of more of us living to 120 or
beyond. When Judith Campisi explained to a group in San Francisco
that her aging research could dramatically extend the lives of
people, the problem of overpopulation came up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perception that what we are doing is bad for all humankind
can't be ignored,'' she worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is huge hypocrisy around this issue,'' said Steve Austad
of the University of Idaho. ``Some of the same people who respond
that too many people will live too long are lined up at the drug
counters buying melatonin and other supplements purported to have
anti-aging powers.''  &QL; 
ETHICS OF AGING &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bill Arnold, director of the gerontology program at Arizona
State University, worries that without thoughtful discussions now,
only the rich will be able to benefit from some of the scientific
advances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ethics will become a major point of discussion where science,
medicine, economics and aging interface,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most agree that major health-policy decisions need to be made
before some of the stem-cell treatments are ready for the market,
which may not be too far off.
</P>
<P>
   For a price, injections will be able to rejuvenate joints,
muscles, organs, skin, even brain cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, the biggest challenges facing aging America will
be psychological,'' said Ken Dychtwald, a psychologist and author
of the new book ``Age Power.'' ``America has always considered
itself a young nation, a new society _ not an old one.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dychtwald predicts that it will happen: ``We are the
beneficiaries of a Wild West of organ cloning, cyborg body parts,
nutricuticles and biotech manipulations of the biological clock to
the extraordinary extent that some baby boomers will live well past
100 with the look and feel of 50 and 60-year-olds.'' &QL;

<P>
   If life-extending scientific advances continue at their present
fast pace, the big question for many people becomes:
</P>
<P>
   What on earth to do with that extra 20, 30 or more years?
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the next 10 years, there will be a lot of grappling with
what being old chronologically is all about _ and what to do with
those extra years,'' said Marc Freedman, author of a new book about
living longer, ``Prime Time.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are the views of some of the experts:
</P>
<P>
   _ Bill Arnold, director of Arizona State University's
gerontology program, hopes not to see everyone as greeters at
discount stores. He would like to see cultural changes to make sure
older people are engaged in their careers longer or in new
volunteer activities worthy of their experience and wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   _ Anne Lindeman, executive director of the (Arizona) Governor's
Advisory Council on Aging, says people ages 60 and older will have
to stay on the job if we want to keep the economy growing.
Employers won't have the option of phasing out all the 50something
workers, she says, predicting that early retirement will simply
disappear over the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Lindeman doesn't foresee the demise of retirement communities,
but she predicts that aging baby boomers may be more interested in
Soho lofts and nearby coffee houses.
</P>
<P>
   _Michael Fossel, a doctor at Michigan State University and
editor of the ``Journal of Anti-Aging Medicine,'' predicts not just
second careers and marriages, but third and fourth.
</P>
<P>
   _Dr. Evan Kligman, who directs the longevity program at Canyon
Ranch health spa in Tucson, Ariz., predicts that there will be more
intergenerational communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more, we will get away from segregating older
people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kligman has a hard time imagining the baby boomers being pushed
out of the mainstream, and he predicts that devices at home will
monitor your health systems and tell you when to arrange a
teleconference with your doctors.
</P>
<P>
   _Dr. Andrew Weil of the University of Arizona in Tucson suggests
that future health care may be delivered in spalike settings, with
some areas set aside for high-tech procedures and others for
nutritionists, exercise trainers, acupuncturists and body work
specialists.
</P>
<P>
   _James Birren, associate director of the Center on Aging at
UCLA, says most people haven't caught on yet to the huge change
coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans are living 30 years to 50 years longer than at the
turn of the century, but society still thinks decrepitude sets in
at 60,'' the energetic 80-year-old scientist said. ``We've turned
the age pyramid upside down, and our institutions are not ready for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Birren estimates that 10 percent of today's older people are
what psychologists term ``explorers'' _ the elite group who move
into their 70s and 80s at full steam and in good health, driven by
an intense interest in life. Even without further scientific
advances, he predicts, by 2030 about 30 percent of elders will be
in this active group.
</P>
<P>
   Getting everyone into a new idea of what ``older'' means is a
first step, Birren says.
</P>
<P>
   Asked today, most people say they don't want to live to be 100
because they think that means toddering, forgetful and frail. But
that is the old idea of old.
</P>
<P>
   The new definition will come into focus as the good health and
achievements of the . . . shall we say . . . ``very experienced''
people become commonplace. &QL;

   If life-extending scientific advances continue at their present
fast pace, the big question for many people becomes:
</P>
<P>
   What on earth to do with that extra 20, 30 or more years?
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the next 10 years, there will be a lot of grappling with
what being old chronologically is all about _ and what to do with
those extra years,'' said Marc Freedman, author of a new book about
living longer, ``Prime Time.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are the views of some of the experts:
</P>
<P>
   _ Bill Arnold, director of Arizona State University's
gerontology program, hopes not to see everyone as greeters at
discount stores. He would like to see cultural changes to make sure
older people are engaged in their careers longer or in new
volunteer activities worthy of their experience and wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   _ Anne Lindeman, executive director of the (Arizona) Governor's
Advisory Council on Aging, says people ages 60 and older will have
to stay on the job if we want to keep the economy growing.
Employers won't have the option of phasing out all the 50something
workers, she says, predicting that early retirement will simply
disappear over the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Lindeman doesn't foresee the demise of retirement communities,
but she predicts that aging baby boomers may be more interested in
Soho lofts and nearby coffee houses.
</P>
<P>
   _Michael Fossel, a doctor at Michigan State University and
editor of the ``Journal of Anti-Aging Medicine,'' predicts not just
second careers and marriages, but third and fourth.
</P>
<P>
   _Dr. Evan Kligman, who directs the longevity program at Canyon
Ranch health spa in Tucson, Ariz., predicts that there will be more
intergenerational communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more, we will get away from segregating older
people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kligman has a hard time imagining the baby boomers being pushed
out of the mainstream, and he predicts that devices at home will
monitor your health systems and tell you when to arrange a
teleconference with your doctors.
</P>
<P>
   _Dr. Andrew Weil of the University of Arizona in Tucson suggests
that future health care may be delivered in spalike settings, with
some areas set aside for high-tech procedures and others for
nutritionists, exercise trainers, acupuncturists and body work
specialists.
</P>
<P>
   _James Birren, associate director of the Center on Aging at
UCLA, says most people haven't caught on yet to the huge change
coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans are living 30 years to 50 years longer than at the
turn of the century, but society still thinks decrepitude sets in
at 60,'' the energetic 80-year-old scientist said. ``We've turned
the age pyramid upside down, and our institutions are not ready for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Birren estimates that 10 percent of today's older people are
what psychologists term ``explorers'' _ the elite group who move
into their 70s and 80s at full steam and in good health, driven by
an intense interest in life. Even without further scientific
advances, he predicts, by 2030 about 30 percent of elders will be
in this active group.
</P>
<P>
   Getting everyone into a new idea of what ``older'' means is a
first step, Birren says.
</P>
<P>
   Asked today, most people say they don't want to live to be 100
because they think that means toddering, forgetful and frail. But
that is the old idea of old.
</P>
<P>
   The new definition will come into focus as the good health and
achievements of the . . . shall we say . . . ``very experienced''
people become commonplace. &QL;

INTERNET COMPANIES MUST LEARN TO COEXIST AFTER AOL DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KATIE HAFNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Four years ago, when Barbara Ransford happily reported that she
was now on the Internet, having just signed up with America Online,
her son-in-law, Bill Joy, was quick to correct her. Joy, a Sun
Microsystems co-founder who helped build the Internet in the 1970s,
explained that America Online was actually a proprietary network
that allowed access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a level of detail that didn't matter to her,''
recalled Joy. ``She wanted me to meet her on a chat list. I told
her it didn't work on my computer.''
</P>
<P>
   The exchange between a member of cyberspace's old guard and a
``newbie'' underscores the fact that to its 20 million paying
subscribers, America Online is the Internet, the cyberspace
entrance of choice for more Americans than the next dozen largest
Internet service providers combined. Roughly one of every two
households in the United States sees the online world through the
prism of AOL, according to AOL's own figures.
</P>
<P>
   The company's announcement last week of a $165 billion merger
with Time Warner further solidifies its domination of cyberspace by
linking large amounts of content _ everything from magazines and
books to cartoons, movies and recorded music _ to its ever-growing
audience.
</P>
<P>
   After the deal was announced, analysts, journalists and
investors asked, ``Who's next?'' Speculation abounded: Would Yahoo
merge with Disney? Would Microsoft swallow Viacom, which is already
merging with CBS?
</P>
<P>
   But a great deal of head-scratching produced no obvious
pairings, primarily because America Online is an unusual hybrid
that has thrived with a mix of virtual communities and copious
proprietary content and services. And, yes, access to the Internet
_ but almost incidentally and usually carefully choreographed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elsewhere on the Internet, access and content have diverged as
businesses,'' said Chris Charron, an analyst with Forrester
Research, a market research company in Cambridge, Mass. ``The
Mindsprings and Earthlinks and AT&AMP;T Worldnets have been
unsuccessful in the content space,'' he said, referring to other
leading Internet service providers. Other content providers, he
added, have been unsuccessful at providing Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   That this strange hybrid has come not only to dominate the
Internet but to personify it sends a strong signal to its
competitors, which include portal sites on the World Wide Web like
Yahoo and Lycos, as well as hundreds of Internet service providers
large and small. The message is this: Find a way to co-exist with
this behemoth.
</P>
<P>
   ``With so many assets under one roof, or within one company, the
threat is certainly substantial to any other company in the same
space,'' said Anya Sacharow, an analyst with Jupiter
Communications, a market research firm in New York.
</P>
<P>
   While not entirely ruling out the possibility of a merger in the
future, Tim Koogle, Yahoo's chief executive, said his company
preferred to build a broad set of partnerships with hundreds of
content providers. ``We will try very hard not to do anything that
limits the flexibility we have or decreases the comprehensiveness
of our platform,'' Koogle said.
</P>
<P>
   Koogle pointed out that by the end of December, Yahoo had 120
million users, up from 105 million at the end of September. Yahoo
charges no fee to its users.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to AOL's image, people do not think of Yahoo as the
Internet but rather as part of the World Wide Web, which itself is
a part of the Internet. This, said Koogle, suits him just fine. The
newest generation to come online, he said, ``knows what the Web is
and knows what Yahoo is.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say Yahoo's strong fourth-quarter earnings report last
week validates not only its independent status but also its
strategy of making wide-ranging but limited deals with partners and
emphasizing the Yahoo brand.
</P>
<P>
   ``That card of agnosticism may take on greater value in light of
the AOL-Time Warner deal,'' said Charron. ``They can say, `We are
truly the only open portal.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yahoo isn't running scared by any means,'' said Michael
Graham, an Internet analyst with Robertson Stephens in San
Francisco. ``Their business is different from AOL's, and they're
going through the roof.''
</P>
<P>
   That leaves everyone else, portals and Internet service
providers alike, facing tough competition from an AOL-Time Warner
colossus.

 UNDATED: Warner colossus. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Basically, the broad-based portals in this middle space are in
for some trouble,'' Charron said of companies like Excite(AT)Home,
Lycos and Snap.com. ``They're in a tough position because they're
trying to support a very expensive cost structure, they're trying
to develop, and they're battling against the Yahoos and AOLs, who
are doing it better and have more access to capital and
opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all the analysis of business models and strategies, much
of the magic of America Online, say observers, lies with its utter
simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is why Steve Case has really won the war at the end of
the day,'' said John W. Sidgmore, vice chairman of MCI Worldcom,
referring to America Online's 41-year-old chairman and chief
executive. ``Steve knew that most customers really want simple
access, user friendliness and a tool that's very easy to use.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all who use America Online love its self-conscious
simplicity. Gregory Dreicer, a historian of technology and
currently a fellow at the Center for Scholars and Writers at the
New York Public Library, dislikes America Online's user interface,
especially the advertising windows he encounters when he logs on.
But has no plans to defect after using the service for the past 18
months.
</P>
<P>
   Many people, Dreicer among them, stay with AOL because they are
creatures of habit.
</P>
<P>
   Molly Dougherty, a consultant to nonprofit organizations in
Austin, Texas, is also lukewarm on the America Online environment,
but she does not want to give up her e-mail address because unlike
most other services, AOL does not forward e-mail to users after
they leave.
</P>
<P>
   Charlene Li, a senior analyst with Forrester Research who
follows America Online, said she keeps trying to persuade her
husband to switch to a more sophisticated set of Internet access
tools, but he is ``addicted'' to America Online. ``If I left him
alone he'd be totally, hunky-dory happy with AOL,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   America Online does not reveal what percentage of customers drop
the service, but a Forrester study conducted last year estimated
the company's annual churn rate _ the number of paying subscribers
who cancel the service _ at just 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Garry Betty, chief executive of Earthlink, said he was not
worried about competing with AOL after a Time Warner merger.
``America Online is an online service, not an ISP,'' or Internet
service provider, said Betty, whose company's advertisements have
sought ``AOL graduates.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We owe a debt of gratitude to America Online,'' Betty said,
``because they're the trailblazers, and they continue to
communicate the importance of the Internet to the masses. They
could even be said to be responsible for increasing the penetration
of PCs in households.''
</P>
<P>
   So, while many Internet purists are rankled by the popular
confusion of AOL with the Internet, the distinction remains
irrelevant to the likes of Ms. Ransford. She says her only
frustration with America Online arose when she was visiting her
daughter and Joy recently at their home in Colorado. She was unable
to check her personal financial portfolio using her hosts'
computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't have the most updated version of AOL,'' she said.

 By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week's purchase of Beauty.com by Drugstore.com for $42
million in stock marked the first of what could be a rash of
consolidations among online retail categories cluttered with
well-financed _ but poorly patronized _ Web stores.
</P>
<P>
   The beauty category, which includes retailers of perfumes and
cosmetics, certainly qualifies as cluttered, with about 300 sites
with similar names selling similar goods. Add to that list a string
of established mass market retailers like Wal-Mart and CVS that
have begun selling the same items online, and the opportunity for
meaningful market share looks slim.
</P>
<P>
   But these purveyors of glamour have concerns more pressing than
the sheer number of competitors. Analysts say that any online
retailer hoping to make a dent in the estimated $15 billion beauty
market cannot hope to succeed without the cooperation of the Big
Three of the beauty industry _ Lancome, Estee Lauder and Clinique,
which is a unit of Estee Lauder Cos.
</P>
<P>
   Those three brands account for roughly 70 percent of the
so-called prestige beauty goods market, which itself is estimated
at about $4 billion. Not only are those brands crucial for
attracting customers, analysts say, but they provide a much more
reliable source of profit than cheaper mass market goods widely
found on the Web. Besides carrying lower profit margins, mass
market beauty products are also proving a tough sell online, given
that shipping charges can equal the cost of the products
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinique and Lancome sell their goods through their own
Web sites _ and Estee Lauder is expected to do so this year _ all
three companies forbid retailers to sell their brands online. That
has left online retailers to choose between selling more obscure
prestige brands or mass market brands like L'Oreal's Maybelline and
Procter &AMP; Gamble's Cover Girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies like Estee Lauder see their brands as the crown
jewels,'' said Lisa Allen, an analyst with Forrester Research.
``They pay close attention to things like how and where they're
displayed, who they're next to.''
</P>
<P>
   Estee Lauder, which sells exclusively to upper-crust retailers
in the traditional world, would not risk tarnishing its image by
displaying goods in drugstores alongside mass market brands,
analysts said. Likewise, the company's executives are loath to do
the same thing online, where most beauty sites sell a wide range of
brands.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Saks, you buy the whole ambience,'' said Karen Shoenbart,
group president of the NPD Group, a research and consulting firm.
At an online site, she said, ``you could get a jar of moisturizer
for $30, or $10 within a few clicks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How can prestige brands differentiate themselves at an online
store?'' she added. ``Why pay $30, not $10, if you're not enjoying
this shopping experience that much more?''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Angela Kapp, vice president of the online division of
Estee Lauder Cos., said: ``The great danger for prestige brands is
commoditization. We have to be very careful about that because our
brand equity is everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Estee Lauder is ``in the process of defining its overall
strategy'' with regard to the Web, Ms. Kapp said, but the company
``has no plans to sell to Internet pure plays,'' using industry
vernacular for Internet-only merchants.
</P>
<P>
   So the question, analysts said, comes down to whether the
prestige brands can afford not to sell through online retailers
indefinitely, or whether the lure of online profits will outweigh
the fear that the Web will damage brand image.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Allen of Forrester Research said manufacturers of prestige
cosmetics ``should recognize they can still have some control of
their brand while allowing retail partners to sell online.''
</P>
<P>
   She offered an example: ``They can create a microsite, ship it
to the retailer and tell them it's the only way they can display
the products online. That way they protect the crown jewels and use
the Web for what it's good at: marketing, growing the customer
database, doing research and educating existing clients and sales
personnel about the products.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a company microsite _ a collection of Web pages
within another company's site _ is precisely the approach taken by
BeautyJungle.com, a beauty goods retailer that made its debut in
November. BeautyJungle sells products through five different
boutiques within its store, depending on the pedigree of the item
in question. Within the Elite Street boutique, for example,
manufacturers can create so-called ``brand rooms'' _ pages with
large advertisements intended to convey the brand's message.
</P>
<P>
   Elite Street also offers a higher level of customer service than
other boutiques. It features e-mail product consultation, and in
the future will allow for instant messaging or chat consultations,
said Edward LaHood, the company's chief executive. By contrast, the
Main Street boutique, which sells beauty products commonly found in
drugstores, is self-service.
</P>
<P>
   LaHood said he hoped BeautyJungle's Elite Street strategy,
combined with heavy investments in customer service and fulfillment
operations, would ultimately persuade prestige brands to sell to
his site. But he said the company had other sources of revenue in
case those brands continued to shun online retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among those sources is a business-to-business component,
wherein BeautyJungle will create beauty-related sites for other
retailers or manufacturers, and also handle fulfillment and
customer service. LaHood said the company was ``in discussions''
with about 20 potential clients, with the first deal signed by
Bolt.com, a site for teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   Declining to say how much the company would charge for such
services, LaHood asserted that the revenues from the
business-to-business effort would ``eclipse those from the
business-to-consumer side'' within two years.
</P>
<P>
   For competing beauty sites that have no such source of revenue,
but that still want to cater to the high-end beauty market, there
are two possible routes. In fact, both approaches are embodied by
the beauty-related sites that have recently attracted the highest
number of visitors, according to Media Metrix, an online traffic
measurement firm.
</P>
<P>
   Eve.com, which led the Media Metrix rankings of beauty sites in
November, offers a long list of prestige beauty products from
companies that have chosen to sell online, including Awake,
Bvlgari, Nina Ricci and Philosophy. Meanwhile, it bolsters the more
well-known prestige selections with lesser-known brands like Yohji
Yamamoto or Weleda.
</P>
<P>
   IBeauty.com, on the other hand, sells brands like Estee Lauder
and Lancome on an unauthorized basis, meaning they procure the
products from nonmanufacturer sources.
</P>
<P>
   Elana Posner, executive vice president of IBeauty.com, said,
``This is a sound business practice, because IBeauty's No. 1
priority is meeting customer demand and sustaining high customer
satisfaction with our services.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Inevitably the floodgates will open'' Ms. Posner said, ``as
they did in the retail industry, because as traditional
manufacturers transition to an Internet-friendly business model,
their product supply and distribution practices must shift
accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be true, but analysts said that in the short term,
those beauty sites that cannot serve customers with a full range of
products _ and that choose not to sell unauthorized manufacturer
goods _ will suffer. ``I definitely see more consolidation,'' said
Ms. Allen of Forrester Research. ``I just don't see how a lot of
the cosmetics sites with brands that many mainstream women have
never heard of, never mind bought or used, can ever survive.''

<P>
   For the past 30 years the greatest novelists writing in English
have been genre writers: John le Carre, George Higgins and Patrick
O'Brian.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, of course, found the press discovering some writer
whose style, provenance and choice of theme it found endearing.
These usually trig, slim tomes shared a wistful and
self-commendatory confusion at the multiplicity of life and stank
of Art. But the genre writers wrote without sentimentality; their
prose was concise and perceptive; in it the reader sees the life of
which they wrote, rather than the writer's ``technique.''
</P>
<P>
   For to hell with this putrid and despicable Graduate Degree
sensitivity. Le Carre had been a spy, Higgins was a working lawyer
and district attorney, and God knows what Patrick O'Brian had not
been up to in his 80-plus years.
</P>
<P>
   Last week I put down O'Brian's sea novel ``The Ionian Mission''
and said to my wife, ``This fellow has created characters and
stories that are part of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   She said: ``Write him a letter. He's in his 80s. Write him and
thank him. And when you go to England, look him up, go tell him.
</P>
<P>
   ``How wonderful,'' she said, ``to be alive, when he is still
alive. Imagine living in the 1890s and being able to converse with
Conan Doyle.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, I saw myself talking with Patrick O'Brian. ``Sir,'' I
would have said, ``what a blow, the death of Barret Bonden.''
(Bonden, the coxswain, half-carries the wounded Captain Aubrey from
the deck of a sinking privateer: ``We'd best get back to the barky,
sir, as this ship's going to Kingdom Come,'' the closing sentence
of the novel.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Sir,'' I would have said, ``I've read your Aubrey-Maturin
series three or four times. When I was young I scoffed at stories
of the Victorians who lived for the next issue of the Strand and
the next tale of Sherlock Holmes; and I scoffed at the grown women
and men who plagued Conan Doyle to rescind Holmes' death at the
Reichenbach Falls. But I am blessed in having, in my generation, an
equally thrilling set of heroes, and your characters have become a
part of my life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your minor characters,'' I would have said, ``are especially
dear to me: the mad Awkward Davis; Mrs. Fielding, the inexpert spy;
old Herapath, the cowardly Boston loyalist; Christy-Palliere, the
gallant French sea captain; and, of course, Barret Bonden, Captain
Aubrey's coxswain.'' And I will not say I cried at his death, but I
will not say I did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, Sir,'' I might have said, ``I hope I do not overreach
myself, but your prose is clear and spare as anyone could wish,
quite as ironical as Mark Twain. ...'' And I hoped I should have
the reserve to refrain from burdening him with a fan's fulsome,
needless interpretation: that I could repay my debt with a
straightforward statement of thanks.
</P>
<P>
   The perfect medium for such, of course, is not the meeting, but
the concise note.
</P>
<P>
   So I sat at the breakfast table composing my note, and leafed
through the newspaper and read of Patrick O'Brian's death.
</P>
<P>
   His Aubrey-Maturin series, 20 novels of the Royal Navy in the
Napoleonic Wars, is a masterpiece. It will outlive most of today's
putative literary gems as Sherlock Holmes has outlived
Bulwer-Lytton, as Mark Twain has outlived Charles Reade. God bless
the straightforward writer, and God bless those with the ability to
amuse, provoke, surprise, shock, appall.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of literature is to Delight. To create or endorse
the Scholastic is a craven desire. It may yield a low-level
self-satisfaction, but how can this compare with our joy at great,
generous writing? With our joy of discovery of worth in the simple
and straightforward? Is this Jingoism? The use of the term's a wish
to side with the powerful, the Curator, the Editor. The
schoolmaster's bad enough in the schoolroom; I prefer to keep him
out of my bookshelf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Henry Esmond'' was a genre piece, as were the Waverly novels,
``Shadows on the Rock'' and, if you will, both ``Don Quixote'' and
``War and Peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Albright's ``That Which I Should Have Done I Did Not Do''
is a genre painting: the decayed, grotesque door, hung with a
funeral wreath. As a child I used to gaze at it, in the Art
Institute in Chicago. ``Yes,'' I would say to myself, ``aha, yes, I
understand.''
</P>
<P>
   I didn't, but I understand now.
</P>
<P>
   Shel Silverstein said that there were some authors whose books
one wanted literally to hug to oneself: with thanks, and in
unavailing protest that, at some point, the works had an end.
</P>
<P>
   Trollope wrote that his imaginary Barsetshire was as real to him
as any place in England, and that he was loath to leave it, but
that that story was now done.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick O'Brian, rest in peace.

DOUBTS RAISED ABOUT SOURCE IN BANK OF NEW YORK INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the months since news broke that billions of
dollars in suspect Russian money had flowed through the Bank of New
York, an obscure, emigre lawyer has done as much as anyone to keep
the story alive and build pressure on the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Emanuel E. Zeltser, a classically trained pianist who passed the
New York bar exam without any formal legal training in the United
States, has positioned himself as the kind of savvy, inside source
that journalists and investigators covet.
</P>
<P>
   Material circulated by Zeltser and his associates has figured
prominently in articles in The New York Times, The Wall Street
Journal, USA Today and the financial wire service Bridge News.
Zeltser portrays himself as an anticorruption crusader, committed
to exposing the truth about Russian improprieties.
</P>
<P>
   But a look at his business dealings and his past, based on
interviews and court records, raises questions about whether
reporters and others have been too willing to accept help from a
person whose ethics and credibility are in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers and sworn testimony, former business associates
have accused Zeltser of faking financial and legal documents. An
administrator of the Moldovan law school from which he purportedly
graduated has signed an affidavit asserting that his law diploma is
a ``fabrication'' _ a significant charge because it was his
Soviet-era law degree that allowed him to take the bar exam in this
country. State and federal authorities are currently examining
Zeltser's license to practice law in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The federal investigation of the Bank of New York continues and
the bank has acknowledged that it failed to supervise its Russian
accounts properly. The bank has not been charged with wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The sprawling investigation has generated enormous coverage by
the news media. But some of the flourishes that Zeltser has managed
to add to the story, while not undermining the importance of the
investigation, are in question.
</P>
<P>
   Doubts have emerged about the authenticity of at least one
document distributed to reporters by Zeltser and his associates _
an internal World Bank memo that suggested that an official at the
bank was conspiring with a Bank of New York client to trade
illegally on inside information.
</P>
<P>
   Zeltser denied circulating forged documents and insisted in
interviews that the accusations against him in court cases are
attempts by Russian organized crime to silence him. ``Players on
the Russian side are very dangerous and very brutal,'' Zeltser
noted in a letter to The Times. ``I and others allied with me who
sought to expose their criminal operations in the U.S. were
subjected to vicious harassment, death threats and actual physical
retaliations.''
</P>
<P>
   Zeltser himself is not above threatening retribution. When The
Times informed Zeltser that it intended to investigate his past, he
promised to ``retaliate.''
</P>
<P>
   Within days, he and his associates unleashed accusations, some
posted on his Web site, that this New York Times reporter was in
league with the Russian mob, intimidated witnesses in a federal
court case, sexually harassed one of Zeltser's female associates,
conspired with the Bank of New of York and, ultimately, developed a
romantic interest in Zeltser himself.
</P>
<P>
   Zeltser's interest in the Bank of New York inquiry is not
selfless. Days after the story erupted, he laid the groundwork for
a $2 billion lawsuit against the bank. He later joined forces with
Milberg, Weiss, a New York law firm that is bringing its own suit
against the Bank of New York. Milberg declined to comment on the
record about its dealings with Zeltser.
</P>
<P>
   Zeltser emigrated from the Soviet Union in 1974. Settling in
Richardson, Texas, he cleaned tables at a Burger King and played
piano in a local strip joint before moving to New York a year later
to study music at the Juilliard School.
</P>
<P>
   But he left Juilliard before completing his degree, and by the
early 1980s he had undergone the first in a series of
transformations, emerging as an entrepreneur engaged in a broad
range of business activities.
</P>
<P>
   Zeltser's associates, who have requested anonymity because they
say they fear reprisals, have said his ventures netted substantial
sums. Those ventures also produced several lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   One case arose over a small New Jersey medical clinic called
American Urgy. Zeltser began working as an adviser to the clinic in
late 1987. Not long after, according to a civil lawsuit filed
against him and others in New Jersey Superior Court in 1988 by one
of the clinic's founders, Zeltser helped hatch an illegal takeover
of the clinic that allowed him to divert its assets for his ``own
use.''
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, one of American Urgy's doctors, Vivian
Bethala, testified that financial records Zeltser tried to
introduce in court proceedings had been falsified.
</P>
<P>
   Zeltser disputed all the accusations against him in that case
but was found liable and eventually assessed about $2 million in
damages _ damages that remain unpaid.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1989 deposition taken for the case, Zeltser described
himself as a ``nonlawyer.'' The next year, however, his status
changed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Zeltser took advantage of rules that allowed immigrants
holding overseas law degrees to take the New York bar exam. He
passed the bar exam on his first try.
</P>
<P>
   He told New York legal authorities that he had received a law
degree in 1974 from Kishinev State University in his native
Moldova. Kishinev has no record of Zeltser's attendance; most of
the classes he claims to have taken were not part of the school's
curriculum. He does not appear in the class photo, and his diploma
is conspicuously different from those of other students.
</P>
<P>
   Zeltser acknowledged the inconsistencies. But he contended that
the reason there was no record in Moldova of his attendance at
Kishinev and the reason his course work and diploma were so
singular, was because he was enrolled in a top-secret program in
international law that few people knew about. He also asserted that
his original law school records were destroyed during the collapse
of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   An affidavit submitted in a lawsuit filed in federal court in
Manhattan by Zeltser against Inkombank, once one of Russia's
largest banks, contradicts this scenario. In the affidavit, George
S. Zhitar, personnel director at Moldovan State University, the
successor school to Kishinev, described Zeltser's diploma as a
``fabrication.'' Zhitar said the records of every law student who
attended the school between 1959 and 1997 were intact and on file.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Zeltser's nascent legal career got its biggest boost in 1993
when he began working for Inkombank.
</P>
<P>
   Inkombank, which collapsed in 1998, is today seen as one of
Russia's most disreputable banks, suspected of pilfering the
deposits of thousands of average Russians.
</P>
<P>
   The bank first retained Zeltser to handle lease disputes in New
York. But Zeltser graduated to bigger things when he and an urbane
Shearson Smith Barney stock broker named Donald Redfern linked up
several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The duo helped Inkombank establish a number of offshore accounts
into which the Russian bank transferred about $30 million,
according to court documents. Redfern, who now works for Bear,
Stearns &AMP; Co., declined repeated requests for interviews.
</P>
<P>
   In short order, Zeltser moved several million dollars out of the
accounts by doctoring forms and forging signatures, according to
associates and to documents in a lawsuit Zeltser filed against
Inkombank in federal court in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   About $2 million of those funds, according to the court papers
and Zeltser's associates, was funneled into bank accounts
controlled by a law partnership headed by Zeltser's ex-wife, Anna
Reid, and a longtime business associate of Zeltser's, Alexander
Fishkin.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Reid did not respond to repeated requests for interviews,
choosing instead to file police complaints asserting that this
reporter was harassing her. Fishkin also did not respond to
numerous requests for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Zeltser disputed in court and in interviews that he had stolen
any money from Inkombank. But he acknowledged in an interview that
about $2 million had moved into the Fishkin-Reid accounts from
offshore entities. He contended that none of the money came from
Inkombank. Although he said he could provide documentation for the
actual sources of those funds, he never did.
</P>
<P>
   Inkombank fired Zeltser in 1994, and he sued the bank the
following year in federal court in Manhattan, saying that the bank
owed him legal fees and that it had stolen money from shareholders
and depositors.
</P>
<P>
   That case foundered in 1998 when Inkombank became insolvent.
Zeltser's legal maneuverings against the bank appeared stalled
until the news broke last August that federal investigators were
looking into possible money laundering at the Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 19, the day that The Times first wrote about the Bank of
New York inquiry, a Russian journalist, Victor Smolny, who
described himself as a friend of Zeltser's, called this reporter to
arrange a meeting with Zeltser.
</P>
<P>
   Although Zeltser has since boasted that he was the source for
The Times' first article, The Times had no contact with Zeltser
before Aug. 19 _ a fact that Zeltser acknowledged in a
tape-recorded interview.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 20, The Times published an article that examined the
activities of Natasha Gurfinkel Kagalovsky, a former Bank of New
York executive. Ms. Kagalovsky has not been charged with wrongdoing
but remains a focus of the federal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In its Aug. 20 article, The Times used memos provided by Zeltser
_ and independently verified before publication _ one of which
indicated that Ms. Kagalovsky had lobbied the Bank of New York's
chairman, Thomas Renyi, on Inkombank's behalf. Zeltser was quoted
in the article, and he was cited as the source for the memos. Other
than the Aug. 20 article, Zeltser has not been a source for any
other articles in the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   After being quoted in The Times, Zeltser became a primary source
for others in the news media. He also has boasted that the FBI is
dependent on his expertise. The FBI declined to confirm or deny a
relationship with Zeltser.
</P>
<P>
   Zeltser's documents led to a number of different stories, many
of which were tangential to the investigation at the Bank of New
York but which advanced the notion of Inkombank as a rogue
operation.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 22, The Wall Street Journal reported that the World Bank
was investigating whether a former Russian representative to the
bank, Leonid Grigoriev, had provided inside information to
Inkombank. Among the documents used by The Journal was a memo
purportedly written by Grigoriev to Inkombank officials.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal provided the memo and other documents to the World
Bank. The bank had not been investigating Grigoriev before it was
approached by the newspaper, World Bank officials said.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 25, Zeltser called this reporter to offer the memo and
other documents he said were associated with the World Bank
investigation. Zeltser said he had provided the memo to The Wall
Street Journal. Later, a longtime associate of Zeltser's, Maria
Berdnikova, asserted that she had provided the memo to The Journal.
</P>
<P>
   The memo, which discusses ways to profit from inside information
about the Russian bond market and is translated from Russian,
almost begs for its author to be caught, containing such bald
admonitions as: ``ATTENTION: the very fact of our participation in
this transaction must remain a secret.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrei Bugrov, Russia's representative to the World Bank and the
official from whose office the memo was purportedly sent, said he
had told The Journal before the inquiry began that he thought the
memo was a fake. In its article, the newspaper quoted Bugrov as
saying the accusations were serious, if true, but did not mention
his concerns about the memo's authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Tofel, a Wall Street Journal spokesman, declined to
discuss the ``particular editorial judgments'' leading to the
omission of those comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were convinced and remain convinced the story was fair and
accurate,'' Tofel said, adding that Bugrov has since told Journal
reporters he shares that assessment. The Journal, Tofel said,
``took steps we thought were sufficient'' to verify the
authenticity of the document.
</P>
<P>
   Bugrov, in an interview on Friday, disputed the Journal's
characterization of his comments about its story. ``I couldn't have
said it was accurate because I told them I thought the memo was
bogus,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank's investigation of Grigoriev is continuing, and
Grigoriev did not respond to interview requests. In its story, The
Journal quoted Grigoriev as initially saying ``I don't believe
anything was done about'' the memo and then, later, flatly denying
writing it.
</P>
<P>
   Zeltser insisted the document was genuine and introduced this
reporter to a woman he described as a European banker working in
London who could attest to its authenticity. That woman, Oxana
Berkounova, turned out to be a lawyer for the the World Bank in
Washington. She has known Zeltser for several years and has
maintained an active e-mail correspondence with him from her World
Bank office.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Berkounova declined to explain her relationship with
Zeltser, replying with a letter saying that this reporter had
sexually harassed her and was writing the article because she had
spurned his advances.
</P>
<P>
   Zeltser boasted to this reporter that other news organizations,
including USA Today and Bridge News, had been outlets for his
documents. USA Today declined to comment on questions about
Zeltser. Bridge News, which published damaging documents about the
Bank of New York's Ms. Kagalovsky _ unsubstantiated documents
Zeltser had shared with this reporter _ also declined to comment,
citing confidentiality agreements with sources. Bridge said its
policy was to corroborate documents with multiple sources.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Zeltser recently stopped discussing these matters
after asking this reporter, ``Do you love me?''
</P>
<P>
   He closed a final conversation by saying: ``I tried to give you
every measure of respect, and you only tried to make a fool of
yourself. Now that you have succeeded, don't call me anymore.''

   FROM VICTIM TO ENTREPRENEUR
</P>
<P>
   If it's true you should invest in things you know, then Mark
Agnew is in the right field: eyeglasses.
</P>
<P>
   That's been his preoccupation since Thanksgiving Day 1987, when
Agnew was mugged in downtown Portland, Maine. Agnew, an investment
banker at the time, lost the use of one eye and has had to wear
glasses ever since to protect his sight in the other.
</P>
<P>
   Agnew, 38, has been frustrated by the eyeglass industry, in
which he asserts the opticians are not helpful and the range of
suitable frames too limited.
</P>
<P>
   But where there's a Web there's a way. Last month, Agnew
introduced an online eyeglass store that lets people shop for
glasses in privacy, with several dozen designer brands to choose
among (www.eyeglasses.com). The company, started with private
financing, is based in Norwalk, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Customers can see how different frames look on their own faces
by using photos, which they scan at home (or at a computer services
store like Kinko's) and then submit to Eyeglasses.com via e-mail.
Various possibilities can be viewed side by side on the Web page.
There is also a feature that lets the customer invite friends into
the virtual dressing room to offer opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Frames from Eyeglasses.com cost roughly the same, or slightly
less than buying them in a store, Agnew said, but the site offers
discounts on lenses, which require the customer's sending a
prescription.
</P>
<P>
   Agnew maintained that trying on glasses virtually, rather than
in person, is helpful for people with poor vision because, he says,
they try on new pairs while still wearing their old pair. --LAURIE

   HOLLYWOOD'S `CONTENT' IS GRIST FOR A START-UP
</P>
<P>
   Here's further proof that Hollywood is no longer merely courting
the Internet industry but ready to marry. On the schedule for
Monday is the announcement of a new Internet incubator founded by
former entertainment industry executives.
</P>
<P>
   Called Fusient Media Ventures, the new company is the work of
Brian Bedol, a former Time Warner executive who also cofounded the
Classic Sports Network, now known as ESPN Classic. Bedol, who also
had a hand in creating MTV, Court TV and Nick at Nite, will serve
as Fusient's president and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   The last few years have seen the rise of venture incubators
focused on various facets of the Internet, but Fusient appears to
be one of the most pedigreed yet to focus on so-called content
rather than technology. The idea, Bedol said, is to identify and
develop material for the coming era of broadband, which is supposed
to enable all companies to broadcast virtually any kind of
programming over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the next few years, content will become as important to
the Internet as programming is to television,'' he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   On the heels of America Online's intention to acquire Time
Warner, the announcement provides even more evidence that the line
between new media and the traditional entertainment business is
blurring.
</P>
<P>
   The founding team of Fusient also includes Stephen D. Greenberg,
former deputy commissioner of Major League Baseball and also
cofounder of the Classic Sports Network, and Tom Lassally, a former
executive vice president of Warner Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg is chairman of the new company, which is based in New
York, and Lassally is president of its West Coast operation.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Marcus, previously senior vice president at Miramax in
charge of international distribution, has joined Fusient as head of
distribution.
</P>
<P>
   The list of Fusient's investors, who have contributed a total of
$30 million, includes Allen &AMP; Co., Berkshire Partners, Redpoint
Ventures and Waterview Partners.
</P>
<P>
   Fusient plans to invest in 15 to 20 start-up companies a year,
and already has committed to two, Bedol said. Among those under
consideration is a teen-age-oriented humor site, though he declined
to give any more information on Fusient's investments.
</P>
<P>
   Stay tuned. Or logged on. Whatever. --LAURIE J. FLYNN &QR;

A CHANCE TO PITCH FOR WOULD-BE MOVIEMAKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By RICK LYMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Jon C. Scheide ambled up to the microphone, 400
pairs of eyes glued to him, utterly sympathetic, while a panel of
movie-industry types stared down dispassionately from their seats
on the dais, like guardians at the gates of heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Scheide began his pitch: a futuristic, gender-bending,
techno-thriller called ``Out of Body, Out of Mind.'' You see, in
the not-so-distant future, you can upload and download
consciousness, meaning that sexual partners can trade bodies and
see what it is like on the other side, until one day a gold-digging
trophy wife refuses to give her tycoon husband his body back and
he/she has to figure out some way to restore matters before she/he
loots his/her bank account and dumps him/her for a younger model.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid I lost you a little bit in the details,'' said
Jacquie Lawrence, an executive with Channel 4 in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps you've buried the best elements in your pitch,'' said
Joe Pichirallo, an executive at Fox Searchlight. ``And I think you
need to decide which way you want to go with this. It could be a
serious thriller, which is how I think you're describing it. Or it
could be a comedy. It could be a big-budget movie with big stars,
or it could be a smaller art film. You need to make some tough
choices. And also I should tell you that we have a story something
like that already in development at 20th Century Fox with Jim
Carrey.''
</P>
<P>
   Scheide leaned forward and beat his forehead against the
microphone, the thundering thump, thump, thump echoing through the
high-tech interior of the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts here.
</P>
<P>
   It was ``Open Day'' at the Seventh Annual International Film
Financing Conference, a somewhat more intimate, boutique-size
alternative to annual gatherings like the American Film Market in
Los Angeles in February and the Independent Film Financing Market
in New York in September. It is a place for aspiring producers and
filmmakers to get together with executives and bankers, people who
buy films or give money to make them, and also to meet one another,
compare battle scars and learn some tricks of the trade.
</P>
<P>
   This particular panel, ``Pitch Perfect: How to Sell Your Idea,''
is always one of the highlights of the festival, as it is in the
growing number of film gatherings, like this, that allow people to
walk in off the street and pitch a movie idea to real, live movie
executives. At this year's Sundance Film Festival, the annual high
point on the independent film calendar, which opens in Utah later
this week, a Los Angeles company will even allow people to pitch
their ideas online.
</P>
<P>
   For the audience it is a kind of entertainment, a catharsis;
they can live out their own best-pitch fantasies and worst-pitch
nightmares without actually being on the line themselves.
</P>
<P>
   For the aspiring filmmakers, it is a golden chance to try out
the silver-tongued pitches they've been practicing before the
bedroom mirror in front of a panel of kindly but somewhat
gimlet-eyed professionals. And there is always the hope, largely
delusional, that one of the panelists will jump up and say,
``That's it, just what we've been looking for!''
</P>
<P>
   After the pitch session, the fourth he has attended in four
years, Pichirallo said: ``I don't expect to find anybody here. That
would be a miracle. But it's so hard to get somewhere in this
business that what I try to do is explain to people the dos and the
don'ts. Just being a good filmmaker does not mean you know how to
sell your idea. But to succeed, that's exactly what you're going to
have to do, over and over.''
</P>
<P>
   The first day of the conference is open; that is, anyone can buy
a ticket and take part in the panels. The rest of the weekend is
limited to the 58 producers and filmmakers whose applications were
accepted from the 300 or so submitted, a winnowing process that
makes the conference more attractive to a lot of production
executives and bankers because it gives them confidence that they
will be faced only with projects of some proven pedigree and not
every deluded aspirant who could afford a bus ticket, plus the
entire graduating class of the local film school.
</P>
<P>
   The success can be seen in the growing number of production
executives who attend the event, up from 6 in its first year to
more than 70 this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm committed to smallness,'' said Wendy Braitman, executive
director of the conference. ``It's about relationships. It's about
building relationships. We allow people to get to know each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   If it doesn't result in an immediate film deal, and it almost
never does, perhaps it can be the beginning of a creative
relationship that will end with a project a few years down the
road, Ms. Braitman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't spend a lot of time talking about content,'' she
said. ``This is about financing, making contacts, learning how to
get your film made. It's such a heartbreak-hotel business. Hearing
some of the success stories and commiserating with one another,
like the people are doing here, takes some of the pain away.''
</P>

<P>
</P>
<P>
   This is a time of enormous change and anxiety in the
independent-film business. Although there have been recent
successes like ``The Blair Witch Project,'' which came out of last
year's Sundance festival, the governing reality for young producers
and filmmakers at this level is that the economic model that
sustained the American independent boom over the last decade has
altered. It is no longer as easy or perhaps even possible to make
the midrange movie, costing $1 million to $3 million, and have any
concrete hopes of it rising above the glut and making it into
theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rules have changed,'' said Jack Lechner, a veteran film
executive and writer who gave the conference's keynote address. It
used to be that a young filmmaker with talent and a decent idea
could make the rounds, get bare-bones financing to shoot a film,
put it out on the festival circuit and have reasonable hopes of
getting a theatrical booking, at least in New York and Los Angeles.
``It rarely works that way anymore,'' Lechner said. ``The films
will more likely sit there, collecting debt and dust while the
filmmakers try and figure out what went wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   What has happened during the last decade or so is that a rising
tide of American independent films _ led by breakout hits like
Steven Soderbergh's ``Sex, Lies and Videotape'' and Kevin Smith's
``Clerks'' _ gradually pushed foreign films out of the small number
of art-film houses around the country. Then, inevitably, the
Hollywood studios smelled profit and absorbed many of the
independent distribution companies, like Miramax and New Line, and
began to make their own independent-style films. Now those films
have pushed most of the genuine independents out of those same art
houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is flooded,'' Lechner said. ``The day of the nice
little movie is over, kaput. The old independent boom has been
absorbed by the mainstream, which has been invigorated by it.''
</P>
<P>
   That was part of the reason for the sense of anxiety and
uncertainty that permeated the conference, as aspiring filmmakers
explored issues like the emerging world of digital production,
alternative avenues of distribution like cable television, and
seeking financing from foreign television markets hungry for
something to fill up their air time.
</P>
<P>
   That the conference comes just before Sundance _ the mountaintop
Valhalla of the independent movement, where perhaps a new ``Blair
Witch'' will emerge, or at least some of the fog may lift and a
path forward reveal itself _ only ratchets up the anxiety level.
</P>
<P>
   It was certainly palpable in the room during the pitch panel. So
many aspiring, creative people trying to figure out how to get
their movies made, how to get in on the party, like people on the
rope line outside a fashionable club trying to figure out what the
doorman is looking for tonight.
</P>
<P>
   The pitches poured out: an immigrant sucked into the life of a
street gang. Brothers born 20 years apart brought together by the
death of their estranged father. An escaped slave who lives with
American Indians in the Carolina wilderness. A kind of rural
Serpico in the Pacific Northwest solving a 50-year-old murder. Two
young women who want to be filmmakers with a story about two young
women who want to be filmmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid you've lost me completely,'' Jan Rofekamp, whose
Montreal-based Films Transits finances documentaries, told one
tongue-tied pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan King of Laurence Mark Productions prodded, ``Perhaps
you should practice this in front of other people first.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Hu of Strand Releasing told one woman: ``You have to keep
in mind what you want from the pitch. What you really want in a
pitch is to set up the next meeting. It's always about the next
step. And you've done that. You've hooked me. I want to know what
happens next.''
</P>
<P>
   Scheide stood against the wall in the back of the conference
hall after his pitch, running it over in his mind. He had come to
the conference hoping to find financing to finish another film and
only put his name in the mix for the pitches on a whim. He thought
he would try out a new idea he was considering for his next
project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw my card in, and then I thought, `Uh-oh, I'd better
figure out what I'm going to pitch,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He listened to the pitches before his, tried to figure out what
the panelists wanted to hear, restructured his ideas on a piece of
scratch paper, then let fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've pitched before,'' Scheide said. ``You know, in the real
world. So this was not my first pitch. What was great about this is
that you got the before and after. Usually you make your pitch and
then you leave. Here they give you instant feedback. That's what
you need. You know, the big thing about pitching is getting over
your fear.''

WHEN CONFIDENTIALITY CEASES TO BE BINDING 
</HEADLINE>
  (SIDEBAR With ZELTSER-PROFILE) 
(js) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Relationships between journalists and their sources are
predicated on the honest exchange of information. That principle is
even more important when a source requests anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Emanuel E. Zeltser, the subject of an article Monday in The New
York Times, has argued that a profile of him is unfair because The
Times agreed to use him as an anonymous source after he was quoted
in an Aug. 20, 1999, story about te money laundering investigation
involving the Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   But Zeltser was repeatedly reminded that the agreement would be
honored only as long as he did not muddy the reporting process with
lies or false documentation.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the Aug. 20 story appeared, Zeltser offered to
arrange a meeting with a person he described as a Russian
intelligence official. When a reporter requested evidence of this
person's credentials, Zeltser canceled the meeting. The Times then
distanced itself from Zeltser.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Zeltser provided The Times with dubious documents
about the World Bank and a Bank of New York executive, Natasha
Gurfinkel Kagalovsky. He also misrepresented the nature of his
relationship with two of his longtime associates, including a woman
who works at the World Bank. At that point, the newspaper decided
to proceed with a profile of Zeltser that drew on some of his
remarks as a background source.

TWO MORE ENTRIES IN THE FLOOD OF DEVICES INTENDED TO HELP SNORERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By TERESA RIORDAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   How loudly does Joseph Goldstein snore?
</P>
<P>
   Well, his wife likes to tell a story about their romantic
vacation at a pricey hotel in the Caribbean, where the guests stay
in little cabins, right on the beach, to fall asleep under the
starry sky as waves lap lullingly against the shore.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble was, the ocean wasn't loud enough to obscure Goldstein's
snoring. Guests in the neighboring cabins phoned the front desk to
complain. The Goldsteins checked out the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   Many treatments already exist for snoring, from Breathe Right
strips to uvulopalatopharnygoplasty, the most widely performed
surgery to treat snoring. And in the past year dozens of new
patents were issued covering the latest artillery in the snore
wars.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent of these went to Goldstein, who was awarded a
patent last week for what he contends will provide relief to
serious snorers like himself. He suffers from sleep apnea, a
snoring-related disorder that afflicts as many as 30 million
Americans and that has been linked to heart disease, strokes, high
blood pressure, daytime fatigue and irritability.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein is an inventor with about 25 patents to his credit.
But most of those are in the packaging-machinery field. He shifted
his inventing sights after he sought medical relief from his
snoring and discovered that he had sleep apnea, which is resistant
to conventional snoring treatments.
</P>
<P>
   So alarmed was Goldstein about the dangers of sleep apnea that
he was moved to write ``Snoring Can Kill!!'' _ a book recently
published by the Caren Publishing Group.
</P>
<P>
   Harmless snoring, according to Goldstein, is a steady rhythm.
Dangerous snoring is syncopated, with gasps for breath. ( Goldstein
sponsors a toll-free number, (888) 35-SNORE, which features the two
different types of snoring.)
</P>
<P>
   ``With sleep apnea, the brain sends out an emergency signal
because it's not getting enough oxygen,'' Goldstein said. ``The
person wakes up suddenly, gasps for breath and then falls back to
sleep often without realizing he has done so. But these arousals
cause a great deal of fatigue and irritability during the day.''
</P>
<P>
   In his book, Goldstein briefly surveys apnea treatments,
including the ``continuous positive air pressure machine,'' or
CPAP, which was invented 20 years ago by an Australian sleep
researcher, Colin E. Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein's invention is actually an attachment to this machine,
which is already widely prescribed for sleep apnea sufferers and
which acts as a miniature air compressor, blowing air into the
breathing passages to keep them open.
</P>
<P>
   ``CPAP is the most effective and noninvasive treatment for sleep
apnea,'' Goldstein said. But, he said, most users find it
exceedingly uncomfortable to use the CPAP mask, which fits over the
face with a tight seal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to stop using it,'' Goldstein said. In many people it
results in a persistent sore on the bridge of the nose. Half of
those who are prescribed the machine stop using it, according to
Goldstein.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Goldstein's attachment, which recently was approved
by the Food and Drug Administration, clamps on to the upper teeth
with a mouth plate that resembles those used by dentists to treat
bruxism _ a condition that is essentially the gnashing of teeth
during sleep.
</P>
<P>
   In place of a mask covering the nose, Goldstein's device has two
parallel tubes that insert into the user's nostrils. The other end
of the tubes attach to the machine.
</P>
<P>
   This arrangement, Goldstein contends, is more comfortable
because it allows the wearer to turn his head from side to side
without bumping his mask on the pillow.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein has begun manufacturing the device through his
company, Stevenson Industries Inc., in Palisades, Calif. It is
distributed through Space Maintainers of Chatsworth, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein received patent 6,012,455. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ANOTHER SOLUTION FOR SNORING PROBLEM
</P>
<P>
   The marketplace abounds with special anti-snoring pillows. But
Robert Hershgordon, of Bensalem, Pa., has patented an anti-snoring
wedge that, instead of replacing the snorer's favorite pillow, can
be used in conjunction with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``People generally become very attached to their own sleeping
pillow,'' his patent notes, and snorers are loath to give up a
pillow that is quite possibly ``the most important part of their
sleep regimen.''
</P>
<P>
   Hershgordon's patent covers not just the foam insert but also an
extra-large pillow case that is big enough to accommodate both the
wedge and an ordinary pillow. The wedge props up the sleeper's
head, according to Hershgordon's patent, and thus alleviates the
snoring.
</P>
<P>
   He received patent 5,920,932. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Patents may be viewed on the Web at www.uspto.gov or may be
ordered through the mail, by patent number, for $3 from the Patent
and Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231. &QL;

DIGITAL COMMERCE: AOL TIME WARNER: A MARRIAGE OF CONVENIENCE _ AND
CONTROL
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By DENISE CARUSO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   America Online's proposed purchase of Time Warner is probably
not, after all, a snapshot of the new economy vs. the old. Nor is
it a slightly sordid wedding between a luscious nubile and her
tottering trophy husband, shuffling to the altar on his last
hormonal surges.
</P>
<P>
   It's more like two very wealthy old men doing comb-overs on
their balding pates, trying to look hip and zippy but not quite
willing to let go of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Like all such deals, this deal is about control _ in this case,
control over as much of the system as possible for the high-speed
delivery of digital entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner, which owns one of the largest and most valuable
libraries of print and video entertainment properties in the world,
also owns one of the largest means of distributing that
entertainment, via its cable television system. That system is now
being retrofitted with Time Warner's Roadrunner high-speed
cable-modem service to deliver as many as 21 million potential
subscribers their daily dose of broad band.
</P>
<P>
   America Online, for its part, talks like an Internet company _
and in fact is the world's largest gateway to the Internet. But it
clings tenaciously to the proprietary, not-the-Net features whence
it came. AOL's 20 million users pay $21.95 a month for the
service's Instant Messaging, e-mail and chat. And while they're
online, their movements are closely tracked throughout the service.
As a result, AOL probably has the most extensive database of online
consumer practices and preferences in the world.
</P>
<P>
   With such huge assets at risk, neither company knows _ or seems
particularly eager to learn _ about operating in an environment
like the Internet, which defies control and confounds planning for
the future. As Scott Rosenberg, a columnist for Salon.com, wrote,
``These companies leapt into bed not because they felt confident
but because they felt insecure.''
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, it seems particularly poignant if not
downright odd that these two companies are set to become co-owners
of a property that would be considered anathema in either of their
proprietary domains: the Open Directory Project (www.dmoz.org), the
only free, resolutely anticommercial, openly available human-edited
directory of sites on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   The benefit of hand-crafted Web directories like Open Directory
and Yahoo _ and the reason for their popularity _ is that they
virtually eliminate the hundreds of irrelevant results that most
automated search engines deliver.
</P>
<P>
   The Open Directory Project, which used to call itself Newhoo,
was started when Rich Skrenta and two other programmers at Sun
Microsystems saw that Yahoo was becoming a victim of its own
success, and a growing number of its links _ first entered by human
hands _ were dead or expired.
</P>
<P>
   So they decided to create the Web's most comprehensive and
accurate directory by building an open system that could accept
input from an unlimited number of volunteer editors.
</P>
<P>
   On June 5, 1998, the site went live. By June 18, there were 200
editors, 27,000 sites and 2,000 categories. By July 10, there were
1,200 editors and 40,000 sites. And in November 1998, shortly
before AOL announced it was buying Netscape, Netscape bought
Newhoo.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the volunteer staff has increased to 21,500 editors
who have indexed more than 1.4 million sites in more than 200,000
categories, according to Skrenta. America Online and its Netscape
subsidiary already have the Open Directory on their own sites, and
they place advertisements on each page of search results that Open
Directory delivers to their customers. This practice is also
followed by Lycos, Alta Vista, Hotbot, Metacrawler and scores of
other sites. That makes it so widely used that, in Skrenta's words,
``We out-refer just about everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   But the directory itself does not sell ads, and he insists it
never will. ``We want to keep the environment as clean for the
editors as possible,'' Skrenta said. ``If someone is putting in
sites for you, you don't want to slow down their experience by
gunking it up with ads.'' As a result, any Web users who do not
want ads ``gunking up'' their screen can set the Open Directory as
their home page.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that a project as noncommercial as Open Directory is
permitted into an environment as proprietary and commercial as AOL
might be seen by some as evidence that AOL ``gets it'' about the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps it does. But it also heightens the contrast between
the open, free flow of information that was the original impetus
for the Internet today's cash-cold realities: All too predictably,
now that it owns one, AOL has already backed off its outraged
demand for open access to cable systems, saying the market should
decide. With so much money riding on hedging the future, especially
if the AOL-Time Warner deal is consummated and inspires similar
mega-deals, the real questions are: What are these guys really up
to? What will they think of next?
</P>
<P>
   While makers of mega-deals are sure to find and cultivate
projects like Open Directory to prove their Net citizenship, they
are clearly angling to carve out the same lucrative fiefs they
controlled in the good old days before the Internet turned their
businesses upside down.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that is their sole intention or whether there is some
new gambit that the strategists haven't come up with yet will
reveal itself as the AOL-Time Warner merger proceeds. But suffice
to say there are likely to be far greater and deeper implications
to this deal than we have heard about so far.

`SREBRENICA': DARK HOURS OF SERBIAN HATRED FILMED BY THOSE WHO
KNEW 
</HEADLINE>

   The viewfinders of camcorders and the memories of survivors
combine powerfully in ``Srebrenica: A Cry From the Grave,'' Monday
night's unsparing account of the July 1995 slaughter of thousands
of Bosnian Muslims by Serbian troops. The number killed remains
uncertain, but the pictures bring home the human suffering and the
political failure of what Bill Moyers, narrating, calls ``the worst
massacre in Europe since World War II.''
</P>
<P>
   The 90-minute BBC documentary begins with Saliha Osmanovic's
return to the Srebrenica graveyard where one son is buried and with
pictures of her husband, captured by the Serbs, calling out
desperately to their other son; both disappeared among more than
7,000 Muslim men who are presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are now under the protection of the U.N. forces,'' the
U.N. commander, Gen. Philippe Morillon, is seen telling Muslims in
1993. But two years later, as a few hundred Dutch soldiers assigned
to keep Srebrenica as what the Security Council designated ``a safe
area'' did nothing to interfere, Bosnian men and boys were
separated from the women and killed.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch troops themselves, starved for food, fuel and
ammunition, became hostages. With Dutch soldiers at risk, NATO
threats to bomb the Serbs proved empty, and the thousands of
refugees fleeing the vengeance of the Serbs were trapped. One woman
says: ``We left without locking the house. I had beautiful big
roses.'' A Dutch officer tells of receiving two orders: one to
defend the refugees, the other, more to the point, ``We don't allow
you to bring body bags home.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most chilling scenes are of Gen. Ratko Mladic, who
led the Serbian assault, assuring his captives that no one need die
if they surrendered their arms, that they would all be safely
carried to Muslim territory, ``women and children first.'' But to
his own troops he declares, ``The time has come to take vengeance
on the Muslims.''
</P>
<P>
   In pictures evidently taken with Western television in mind,
Serbian soldiers hand out candy to Muslim children, but Zumra
Shekhomerovic recalls a different scene amid the chaos of terrified
families: an armed Serb orders her husband, ``You come this way''
and tells her, ``You go on.'' She weeps, ``I never saw him again
and don't know what happened to him.''
</P>
<P>
   A war crimes investigator tells how, beginning on July 14, the
male prisoners were assembled in scattered locations and executions
went on for two days. He estimates that 4,000 or more were
``assassinated in cold blood.'' The search for bodies continues in
preparation for war crimes trials, but the indicted Mladic is
reported to be in comfortable liberty in Serbia. How comfortable
that is was called into doubt by the murder of Zeljko Raznatovic on
Saturday in Belgrade; he was a notorious Serbian paramilitary
leader who had been indicted in 1997 by the International War
Crimes Tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   With the Serbian victory complete, Dutch troops are seen
celebrating their freedom; and there is Mladic offering a toast
(``To a long life!'') and presenting gifts to a Dutch colonel. A
U.N. report, issued last year, admits that errors, misjudgment and
``an inability to recognize the scope of the evil confronting us''
resulted in the failure to protect Bosnian Muslims from the Serb
campaign of mass murder. It concludes, ``The tragedy of Srebrenica
will haunt our history forever.''

EPA CALLS FOR CAUTION ON BIOTECH CROPS

<P>
   The Environmental Protection Agency has announced a series of
new regulations aimed at reducing the environmental risk of corn
genetically engineered to produce its own insecticide. The decision
on Friday, anxiously awaited by farmers, environmentalists and the
biotech industry, was viewed by many as an acknowledgment by the
agency of the rising concern over the safety of biotech crops.
</P>
<P>
   The corn became a rallying point for environmentalists and
opponents of genetic engineering in May when a Cornell University
study found that the corn's pollen could kill monarch butterfly
caterpillars in the laboratory. The corn carries a gene derived
from a bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis, that produces Bt toxin,
which kills pests that eat the plant.
</P>
<P>
   While calling the evidence for harm to monarch butterflies
preliminary, the agency is directing biotech seed companies to ask
farmers to voluntarily protect butterflies that are not pests by
planting traditional corn around the edges of Bt corn fields. That
would create a buffer to prevent toxic pollen from blowing into
butterfly habitats.
</P>
<P>
   The agency also announced that farmers would be required to
plant at least 20 percent of their corn as non-Bt corn. Academic
scientists have been urging the agency to enact such a measure for
years to slow the evolution of resistance to the Bt toxin, one of
the few natural insecticides available to organic farmers.
</P>
<P>
   While academic scientists and environmentalists largely welcomed
the rules, to be enacted this spring, some criticized the agency
for seeking only voluntary protections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very disappointed,'' said Rebecca Goldburg, senior
scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund. Ms. Goldburg expressed
concern that biotech companies had been given the responsibility
for encouraging farmers to protect monarchs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given that the companies involved have spent the last six
months belittling any risks associated with Bt corn pollen, this is
not something that I find easy to believe will happen,'' Ms.
Goldburg said.
</P>
<P>
   Seed companies and biotech industry groups have vigorously
attacked the Cornell study, taking issue with its methodology and
the conclusion that the Bt corn pollen is harmful to monarch
butterflies.
</P>
<P>
   John Losey, an author on the Cornell study, praised the agency's
actions. ``It seems like a good interim approach while we gather
more data,'' he said. While the pollen can kill monarchs in the
laboratory, it is still unknown to what degree they are harmed by
Bt pollen in the wild.
</P>
<P>
   David Andow, an ecologist at the University of Minnesota, who
studies the evolution of resistance to pesticides, called the
measures ``a real step forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have long argued that farmers should plant
traditional corn to provide a refuge for insect pests that are
susceptible to Bt toxin. By maintaining a large population of
susceptible pests, farmers increase the chances that pests
resistant to the insecticide will mate with a susceptible insect.
Their offspring are likely to be susceptible to Bt toxin.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists expressed concerns that farmers might plant only
Bt corn without notice or penalty.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its announcement on Friday, the EPA last month
sent out a notice requiring seed companies to initiate a series of
studies to answer a detailed list of questions about what level of
risk the Bt corn poses to butterflies in the wild.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous other studies are under way on the safety of
genetically modified corn, which was planted on more than 20
million acres last year and is worth hundreds of millions of
dollars in seed sales annually.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Iowa _ A place for horses and hay since before the
Civil War, the old red barn stands at the edge of a cornfield, with
its hand-pegged boards and ladder rungs still covered with bark.
</P>
<P>
   But the horses are long gone. And the old barn is too small to
house the huge combines and tractors now used in farming. Sometime
next month, a bulldozer will knock it over, and the old boards will
be burned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame to see the beautiful old barns go, but they're
useless,'' said John Berdo, whose family has been farming here for
seven generations. ``The old barns are as obsolete as the manual
typewriter in the computer age.''
</P>
<P>
   Long the epitome of agrarian life, old wood barns are vanishing
from the American countryside. They are being replaced by metal
storage buildings, which are cheaper and bigger, if short on charm.
</P>
<P>
   Experts on farm life say that more than half of the nation's
wood barns have already been lost. In Iowa alone, some 1,000 old
barns disappear each year, according to Jacqueline Shmeal, a leader
of the Iowa Barn Foundation, which raises money for the
preservation of the old structures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole countryside is soon going to look like an industrial
park with all of these metal buildings,'' Ms. Shmeal said. ``These
barns are America's best example of folk art. It's terrible to lose
them.''
</P>
<P>
   In large part, the loss of the old barns reflects the declining
number of farmers. In 1900, 50 percent of all Americans lived or
worked on a farm. A century later, that number has shrunk to less
than 1 percent. And farmers today rely on high-powered machines
that can be 16 feet tall and 20 feet wide, much too large to be
stored in the old wood barns, while livestock is often confined to
low-slung metal sheds, which look nothing like the old barns.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of repairing the barns can be prohibitive. Just
installing a new roof can cost $20,000 or more. For farmers
struggling to survive a terrible drop in corn and soybean prices,
such an investment seems foolhardy.
</P>
<P>
   And for preservationist groups trying to keep wood barns around,
cost is a big factor, too. There are no official figures on the
total number of wood barns preserved, but it is relatively small.
</P>
<P>
   While the old barns tug at their emotions, farmers know the
metal barns make more economic sense. And keeping an empty barn, a
tempting place for adventurous children, can pose liability
hazards.
</P>
<P>
   The old barns have a hallowed place in the history and mythology
of rural life. They were, as Henry Ward Beecher wrote in 1869,
``the real headquarters of the farm.''
</P>
<P>
   More than just storage places, the old barns were places where
children played hide-and-seek in hay lofts, where hard-working men
sat down at day's end and mapped a plan for the sunrise and where
neighbors gathered for a dance.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell Soike, the historian for the State Historical Society of
Iowa in Des Moines, recalls his father, Arthur, recounting how, as
a teen-ager, he would play the fiddle at barn dances in rural
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``The barn is the biggest thing on the farm,'' Soike said. ``A
lot of farmers, if they had some money, the barn was the first
place they spent it, not on the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Farmers have not been building wood barns in significant numbers
since the 1940s, according to William Kimball, a retired professor
at Michigan State University and an adviser to the National Barn
Alliance, which promotes saving wood barns.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the nation's old wood barns were built from the 1860s
through the 1940s, Kimball said. In some cases, a neighborhood of
farmers would gather and pitch in to help build a barn.
</P>
<P>
   Barns were often painted red because the pigment oxide was cheap
and durable, although some farmers, including the Amish, considered
red a garish, worldly color and avoided it, Kimball said.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1870s there was a movement toward round or octagonal
barns, largely because some farmers ``believed there was something
sacred in that shape,'' Kimball said. Some of the Shaker barns in
that shape still stand in New England, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kimball, who often speaks to farmer groups, contends that the
old barns have more than just aesthetic and symbolic importance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a resource here, and it's a lot more valuable than
people think,'' he said. ``These barns are easily converted to
other uses.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that barns have been turned into houses, offices,
theaters and churches. The old wood used on the barns is considered
valuable by many antiques dealers and craft workers, Kimball said,
though the preservation process is so time-consuming that it is
often not worth the effort to farmers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ed and Arlene Peiffer, retired farmers who have an old cattle
barn, received a call from some Amish men who offered to dismantle
the structure and haul away the wood for other uses.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have it,'' Peiffer, 78, told them.
</P>
<P>
   The old barn on the Berdo place has withstood too many floods
and storms to count. A terrible windstorm in 1998 flattened at
least 10 barns in Washington County.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to my son that morning, `Maybe the wind has pushed the
old thing down and we'll be done with it,''' Berdo recalled. ``But
then we rounded the corner and there it stood, picture-perfect.''
</P>

   Berdo said the barn was built by his great-great-grandfather
John Winter in the 1850s. Berdo's father, Charles, who died 11
years ago, had a deep sentimental attachment to the barn, because
his own grandfather had worked in the building and his mother,
Carrie, had been born in a house nearby.
</P>
<P>
   In the last years of his life, Charles Berdo had tried
unsuccessfully to interest the county historical society in
refurbishing the barn and keeping it as a museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad and I disagreed on the old barn,'' said Berdo, whose
family keeps a framed painting of the barn in its farmhouse. ``I
know it's a beautiful landmark, but for what?''
</P>
<P>
   Berdo, 49, chuckled a bit at the recollection.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, my dad was pretty tight,'' Berdo said. ``So when
it came right down to it, I don't think he would have put up the
thousands of dollars to save it, either.''

   CHILE-ELECTION (Santiago, Chile) _ Chileans go to the polls to
choose their next president. The race between conservative Joaquin
Lavin and socialist Ricardo Lagos is expected to be close. By
Clifford Krauss.
</P>
<P>
   BUDGET-BATTLE (Washington) _ The annual fight over the federal
budget is about to get under way. Once again, the numbers-crunchers
will predict larger than expected surpluses, and Congress and the
White House will grapple with how to use it: to cut taxes, to
increase spending or to pay back the national debt. The arguments
are familiar, but with an election looming, the outcome could be
different. By William K. Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   GLAXO-SMITHKLINE (Undated) _ Monitoring developments as the
SmithKline and Glaxo boards meet to consider an $80.7-billion
merger that would create the world's largest drug maker. By Andrew
Ross Sorkin.
</P>
<P>
   IOWA-GORE-LABOR (Des Moines, Iowa) _ Al Gore can be thankful
that this state is more than an unending field of corn. Punctuating
the prairies are dozens of industrial plants that serve the
agricultural economy, and the heavily unionized workforce in these
farm-equipment factories and meat-packing plants is a major factor
behind the Gore camp's confidence that the vice president will win
Iowa's Jan. 24 caucuses, the first big test in this year's
presidential campaign. By Steven Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   BYE-BYE-BARNS (Washington, Iowa) _ Long the epitome of agrarian
life, old wood barns are vanishing from the American countryside.
They are being replaced by metal storage buildings, which are
cheaper and bigger, if short on charm. Experts on farm life say
more than half of the nation's wood barns have already been lost.
In Iowa alone, some 1,000 old barns disappear each year. By Dirk
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   TIMES-SQUARE-TRUANTS (New York) _ The police roundups are never
accompanied by a reading of the suspects' Miranda rights. Instead,
the lieutenant in charge usually asks: ``Do you want to work at
McDonald's for the rest of your life?'' The suspects are junior
high and high school students, and they are playing hooky in in the
kind of place that has lured truants for more than a generation: a
shiny new mall. The only difference is that this place is called
Times Square. By Randy Kennedy.

<P>
   It was eight years ago that John C. Malone, the cable television
baron, brashly proclaimed that the average American home would soon
be able to receive 500 channels of information and entertainment.
But since then, the arrival of two-way, high-capacity, high-speed
services has been next year's story.
</P>
<P>
   Like some mythical wild beast that is described but never seen,
broadband _ as such high-speed links are known _ has always been
out there somewhere, just over the horizon. Next year, the analysts
and executives promised, next year.
</P>
<P>
   Five-hundred-channel cable systems have not materialized,
because Malone's original vision is still too far ahead of the
technology _ and more importantly, because the rise of the Internet
overtook plans for other types of interactive TV.
</P>
<P>
   But now, broadband information and entertainment pipelines are
finally reaching at least some American homes. And by agreeing last
week to acquire Time Warner, America Online, the leading Internet
access provider, is betting $165 billion that, at long last, next
year is actually this year.
</P>
<P>
   In that view, and on that big bet, America Online is not alone.
</P>
<P>
   The converging Internet, cable TV and telephone industries are
spending billions of dollars to make broadband a reality _ at an
estimated construction cost of $500 to $600 a household, whether
the broadband connection is through a cable system or telephone
line. The effort represents the most extensive, most expensive
engineering project in residential communications since the cable
TV industry started wiring neighborhoods in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Around the nation, residential streets are being torn up for new
fiber-optic cables. Technicians are testing telephone lines to
ensure compatibility with advanced new technology. Already, some
1.4 million American homes now enjoy broadband on-ramps to what was
once quaintly referred to as the information highway. And by the
end of this year, a large plurality of the roughly 100 million
households in the United States will probably have access to some
sort of high-speed data connection.
</P>
<P>
   So it was the sound of jackhammers and the whine of drills that
gave urgency to America Online's need to do the Time Warner deal.
For by agreeing to acquire Time Warner's media empire and its
far-flung cable television systems, America Online has made a major
concession: that the future of cyberspace for everyday consumers is
not in the phone-line modems and dial-up connections on which
America Online has built its base of 20 million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Starting soon, AOL knows, the Internet companies that will
succeed will be those able to provide the sort of lightning-quick
data connections that until now have been common only in well-wired
business offices.
</P>
<P>
   For all the industry momentum, though, it will take years,
perhaps decades, for broadband data connections to become as common
in American homes as the telephone line. Millions of people,
particularly in rural areas, will probably miss out, at least
during the first rounds of introduction. Initially, broadband
connections will generally be priced at $360 or more a year,
putting them beyond the reach of some households. And in many parts
of the country, systems remain to be built and tested.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the challenges, the broadband beast finally seems poised
for domestication.
</P>
<P>
   ``My message to people in major metropolitan areas is that
broadband is here as of the first quarter for millions of people,''
said Amy B. McIntosh, chief executive of Bell Atlantic's network
data operation. In the next two years, she said, ``We won't
probably get to 100 percent of the homes, but we will get to a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   That the broadband project, despite fits and false starts, is
now moving so quickly is a tribute to the power of competition _ in
this case between the cable television industry and the local
telephone business. Satellite providers and perhaps electric power
companies may well weigh in with their own residential broadband
alternatives during the next few years, but so far have made little
headway.
</P>
<P>
   The cable TV industry, despite having fewer employees and less
money than the local phone companies, has taken the early lead. The
Yankee Group, a technology consulting firm in Boston, estimates
that by the end of 1999, 1.1 million U.S. households received
broadband data connections through cable lines while only about
300,000 had broadband service through phone wires.
</P>
<P>
   The disparity is partly a result of the cable industry's more
aggressive management. Many of even the biggest cable companies
have been run by the entrepreneurs who founded them, or by their
families, while the biggest local phone companies have had
board-room bureaucracies making decisions with more deliberation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``My observation from being in that world for almost a decade is
that there's a lot of big-monopoly bias,'' said Elizabeth Fetter, a
former executive at US West Inc., a regional Bell. Ms. Fetter is
now president of NorthPoint Communications, a small company that
delivers broadband connections through phone wires, using a
technique known as DSL, for digital subscriber lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the Bells had some sort of skunkworks,'' she said,
``but they were small and the very top management didn't put out
the mandate and say, `We're doing it.'''
</P>
<P>
   At least as important in cable's early lead are some fundamental
technical differences between cable and telephone networks. As
Sender Cohen, a data communications analyst at Lehman Brothers, has
said, ``Think of the copper telephone wire as a very thin but very
intelligent pipe, and the cable wire as very fat but very dumb.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways it is easier to impart intelligence than girth.
</P>
<P>
   Cable television systems were designed, obviously, to carry
television signals, which require far more digital bits than even
the quickest data connections generally available to consumers.
Moreover, cable systems have been designed to convey those signals
over many miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The transmission losses are minimal or negligible from
fiber-optic nodes down to homes in any reasonable neighborhood,''
said Trey Smith, chief technology officer of Roadrunner, Time
Warner's cable modem venture.
</P>
<P>
   Local phone wires can also run for many miles, but were
originally meant to carry only voice conversations _ a digital
trickle, compared with the torrent of bits required for a
high-speed cyberspace link. And as more digital bits are pumped
through a telephone wire, the sustainable distance for the flow
rate is reduced. For consumers, that means homes more than roughly
three miles from a telephone switching station have little hope of
getting a high-speed connection through phone wires.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, in a traditional phone network each home
essentially has its own wire running to a switching station. Cable
networks are designed around a ``tree and branch'' architecture in
which traffic is combined from individual homes and routed into
neighborhood-sized communications pipes.
</P>
<P>
   This cable design means that, strictly from the perspective of
raw communications capacity, even a high-speed data connection
hardly taxes a cable system. And just as important is that, from a
network standpoint, one home looks the same as the next. In a
telephone network, by contrast, the link to each home has its own
individual characteristics, starting with the length of the
required copper wire.
</P>
<P>
   The catch is that traditional cable systems are meant to carry
signals in only one direction _ toward the home _ which is one
reason why they are sometimes called ``dumb.'' In the last few
years the cable industry has spent billions of dollars to make its
networks communicate in both directions.
</P>
<P>
   Once those two-way upgrades have been made, though, it can be
much easier for a cable operator to introduce a high-speed Internet
system. A cable operator can offer service ubiquitously throughout
a given neighborhood while telephone technicians must generally
make certain, often by hand, that the wire going to each house is
capable of supporting broadband service.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of things that make us almost have to go out
and physically check a wire-pair to see if we can offer service,''
said John H. Atterbury, president for broadband services for SBC
Communications Inc., the largest local phone company. ``It makes it
impossible to advertise to customers to offer ubiquitous service.''
</P>
<P>
   The cable industry likes to trumpet this difference. ``Cable
gets you to every home in your footprint, and that's a huge
advantage,'' said Daniel Somers, chief executive of cable
operations for AT&AMP;T Corp., which is in the process of becoming the
nation's biggest owner of cable TV systems.
</P>
<P>
   But the phone carriers are moving quickly to catch up to cable.
SBC, for instance, has said it will spend $6 billion in the next
three years to upgrade its networks for high-speed Internet
service.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, phone networks have some important advantages over
cable systems. Once a user is connected to a phone-line broadband
network, the data connection's speed is essentially guaranteed.
Cable's tree-and-branch network layout can reduce the speed of a
user's connection as more people in the same neighborhood sign on.
</P>
<P>
   That difference in basic network architecture, some engineers
say, also makes cable networks more vulnerable to malicious hackers
than phone networks are.
</P>
<P>
   So despite cable's lead, the local phone giants insist that they
will ultimately be able to offer a more attractive high-speed
Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gap in time,'' said Ms. McIntosh of Bell Atlantic, ``will
turn out to be a mere nanosecond when the final verdict is in.''

women stay behind. Pounding bread dough on the kitchen table,

 &HT;    BUCKING SKEPTICISM, ALBRIGHT PRAISES MEXICO FOR WAR ON DRUGS
 &HT;    By Susan Ferriss
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAXACA, Mexico While Mexico faces criticism from some U.S.
lawmakers over its efforts to stop narcotics smuggling, Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright praised this country's commitment to
the war on drugs in a visit here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very evident that cooperation on
narco-traffickers is at a very good level,'' Albright told
reporters after a meeting with Mexican Foreign Minister Rosario
Green in this quaint colonial city in southern Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Mexico's attempts to stop drug smuggling will be in
the spotlight when the Clinton Administration makes its annual
recommendations for which countries should be ``certified'' by
Congress as reliable partners in the war on drugs. Countries that
fail to get a congressional stamp of approval face trade sanctions
or a cut-off in U.S. financial aid.
</P>
<P>
   Albright arrived late Saturday night in Oaxaca, about 280 miles
south of Mexico City, following a two-day visit to Colombia and
Panama. The war on drugs dominated the tour, during which Albright
also met with Colombian President Andres Pastrana to discuss a
proposed $1.6 billion aid package to help Colombian police and
military fight traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   Albright started the day Sunday in Mexico by touring the Monte
Alban pre-Colombian ruins outside Oaxaca. She and Green then met to
also discuss Mexico's concerns about the deaths of migrants
attempting to illegally cross the U.S. border and a dispute over
the United States' continuing refusal to allow Mexican commercial
trucks into U.S. territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned obviously with safety standards, as is
Mexico,'' said Albright. But she and her Mexican counterpart
believe a panel set up by the North American Free Trade Agreement
should resolve the dispute over trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Although the two leaders touched on various topics, drugs were
clearly a central theme.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of cocaine produced in South America and smuggled
into the United States is transported through Mexico. Numerous
powerful cartels operate here, smuggling cocaine, marijuana,
heroine and other drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico - the United States' second-largest trading partner - has
always been certified by Congress. But approval has come only after
heated debate and denunciations by some members of Congress who
believe Mexico has largely failed in its efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has failed to arrest any of the country's top drug lords,
some critics say, despite solid information as to their
whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   The cartels are known to use their vast profits to bribe Mexican
law enforcement officials at all levels. In 1997 Mexico's anti-drug
czar - Gen. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo - was arrested for consorting
with one top trafficker.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said she and Green did not discuss certification during
their meeting, although they talked about bilateral cooperation on
money-laundering investigations and other drug-related topics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's inappropriate to make predictions,'' Albright
said when asked whether the administration planned to recommend
that Mexico be certified.
</P>
<P>
   But she and U.S. Ambassador to Mexico Jeffrey Davidow, who was
also present at the meeting, put a positive spin on Mexico's
commitment over the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's leaders ``view the problems of drugs as seriously as we
do,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   Davidow told reporters that ``within the last year, there has
been an increase in cooperation'' between Mexico and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Mexican Navy seized 20 tons of cocaine off ships
traveling Mexico's coast using technology and information supplied
by American law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plain fact there are 20 tons of cocaine that are not on
our streets this year is because of that level of cooperation,''
Davidow said.
</P>
<P>
   Green said Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo has called
narcotics trafficking Mexico's ``main threat to national
security.''

SOME VIEW WASHINGTON MONUMENT SCAFFOLDING AS ART TO BE PRESERVED

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A year ago, the historic impeachment trial of
President Clinton was burning up this city with the question of
whether a citizen named Monica Lewinsky would be called to tell all
before the Senate and the nation. Precisely a year later, the
capital has slipped into a welcome lame-duck doze in which the
strongest issue in sight is whether the restoration scaffolding
surrounding the Washington Monument has proved to be a more
glorious attraction than the monument itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did rather like the appearance of it _ that high-tech look,
all cobalt and white,'' said Tony Blankley, a ranking media pundit,
in fondly dismissing proposals that the scaffolding never be taken
down, but retained like a diaphanous glove showcasing the monument.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great look, but of course it must come down,'' said
Blankley, ever the traditionalist. His point is being well taken by
a work crew that is about to dismantle the silver-aluminum
scaffolding that is decoratively trimmed in dark-blue polyester
mesh.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 18 months, the scaffolding, created by the
architect Michael Graves, has delighted the city as an entirely
free-standing structure, a lacy workplace unattached to the
monument that served to elegantly mime and highlight the shape of
the 555-foot obelisk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I'd rather see the monument,'' said Jeff Kimsey
from Cleveland, Tenn., one of the many tourists disappointed that
the monument, with its aerial view of the city, has been closed
during the restoration for masonry and elevator repairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought this structure was just a part of the millennium
fireworks,'' he said, eying the scaffolding as its gauzy mesh
highlights were being removed from the tubular girders.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of sparing the airily pleasing structure, whose night
lighting created what seemed an alabaster glow from the monument's
interior, has been carried forth on a Web page, of course. ``The
obelisk, it turns out, is sort of boring,'' concluded Chad Allen on
www.keepitcovered.org.
</P>
<P>
   ``Join the cover-up,'' he pleaded in Washingtonese.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, one of the chief underwriters of the monument
restoration, Target Stores, is already working to resurrect the
scaffolding at half its current size, scaled down for a park site
near the Minneapolis Institute of Art.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were delighted to be part of a process that brought
something artistic to Washington and now we hope to keep it alive
out here,'' said Jim Hale, a senior vice president for Target
Stores, said by phone from Target's headquarters in Minneapolis.
There, the founding Dayton family of the merchant chain has long
prescribed that the corporation donate five percent of its pretax
income to assorted community projects. Reconfiguring the monument
scaffolding at half-size is already being negotiated with Universal
Builders Supply, which built and owns the 575-foot workers'
filigree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well that's a cool idea, keeping the thing alive,'' said
Andrea Kimsey, touring here with her husband. ``Have a piece of
this out there for people who can't get here.''
</P>
<P>
   The scaffolding resembles a towering glass container for the
monument. Among the attributes that Washington denizens have been
most celebrating is the sheer, spin-free innocence of its statement
in such a political city of now you see it, now you don't. It
seemed part beacon, part exclamation point for moving on from
troubles past.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a delight,'' said Peter B. Kovler, who, as one of the
founding sponsors of the highly popular Franklin Delano Roosevelt
Memorial, knows well the risks here in monumental architecture.
``My hat's off to the people who managed to put aesthetics into
something practical in this city.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's a critic,'' he said without complaint, noting
there can be a certain flexibility, too, along the city's acres of
remembering. Indeed, at the Roosevelt memorial on the east bank of
the Potomac, Kovler's family charity is putting up $1 million to
deal with a running complaint. Robert Graham, in conjunction with
the National Organization on Disabilities, has been commissioned to
create a sculpted rendering of Roosevelt in his wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have complained that the true Roosevelt, the leader who
triumphed from a wheelchair, was not fully on display. Visitors had
to search for the sight of a small caster wheel nearly hidden in
the backdrop of one FDR tableau. The new sculpture, with wheels as
bold as Roosevelt, will be at the entrance to the memorial, most
likely heightening interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risks of a public effort at memory, of a restoration from
memory are all worth it,'' Kovler concluded. ``Now let's see the
success of the restored Washington Monument when the scaffolding
come down.''

LINUX VENDOR SET TO GET $57-MILLION INFUSION 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ TurboLinux Inc., a Linux operating system vendor
with roots in the Asian computer market, will receive a $57 million
investment on Monday from Dell Computer, Compaq Computer, Intel and
a variety of other United States computer, software and investment
firms.
</P>
<P>
   Linux, which is a version of the Unix operating system, is seen
as a growing threat to Microsoft and other proprietary operating
system vendors, particularly in Internet-related markets. It was
developed on a volunteer basis by a worldwide group of dedicated
programmers.
</P>
<P>
   The round of private funding, which is the largest to date for a
Linux company, will include investments from Applix, BEA Systems,
Citrix Systems, CSK Venture Capital, CTC, Fujitsu Support and
Service, Inprise, Legend Computer, NEC, Novell, NTT-ME Information
Xing, SCO, Seagate Technology, Toshiba and Toyo Information
Systems. August Capital and Broadview International, which were the
initial investors in the company, also participated in this
investment round.
</P>
<P>
   The investment is the latest in a wave of private and public
investments in Linux software companies like RedHat, Caldera,
LinuxCare and others. Last week, for example, Caldera announced a
private investment of $30 million, the filing of its initial public
offering and the settlement of a civil antitrust suit it had filed
against Microsoft for an amount in excess of $150 million.
</P>
<P>
   TurboLinux said it had particular strength in China and Japan.
The company adds proprietary software to Linux operating systems to
permit Internet sites to cluster together a number of computers
into so-called Web farms, creating more powerful systems.
</P>
<P>
   Linux's particular strength has been that it is more reliable
for business applications than Microsoft's Windows NT 4 operating
system. Next month Microsoft will begin shipping its Windows 2000
program, which is intended to attack the business markets that
Linux has done best in during the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft executives claim they have solved the stability
problems in Windows with their new program. However, Linux still
will enjoy both a cost advantage as well as the advantage of easy
customization because programmers can examine and alter the Linux
source code.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1992, TurboLinux is based in San Francisco, with
offices in Beijing, Tokyo and Sydney, Australia.

CHOICE FOR ISRAEL BANK CHIEF APPROVED BY A SPLIT CABINET 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Over the objections of Israel's finance minister,
the cabinet Sunday night narrowly approved Prime Minister Ehud
Barak's choice of a conservative central bank economist as the
bank's next governor.
</P>
<P>
   David Klein, who heads the central bank's monetary affairs
division, was endorsed in a 10-to-7 vote after a long afternoon of
contentious debate that exposed stark economic-policy divisions in
Barak's center-left coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Five leading cabinet members abstained, including Finance
Minister Avraham Shochat, marking the first time that an Israeli
central bank governor had been selected without finance ministry
support. Foreign Minister David Levy also declined to support
Barak's nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Many institutional investors here applauded the appointment of
Klein, which they saw as an assurance of the continuation of the
policies the previous governor, Jacob Frenkel had enforced during
his eight-year tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Of the several candidates who were considered for the post,
Klein was regarded as philosophically the closest to the hardline
monetarism of Frenkel, who resigned last week to take a
London-based job at Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   Like Frenkel, Klein is an American-educated former staff
economist at the International Monetary Fund who is known for his
opposition to inflation and to intervention in foreign-exchange
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition to Klein ran deepest within the prime minister's own
party, which ran in the last election on a platform advocating
lower interest rates and faster economic growth. Those goals are
unlikely to be priorities for Klein, a career central bank
technician who embodies his institution's resistance to anything
that smacks of inflationary expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Personal appeals from Barak persuaded key ministers from his
party, One Israel, to back away from their earlier-announced
intention to vote against Klein. One of them, Haim Ramon, who is
assigned to the prime minister's office, said later that he changed
his decision only in deference to Barak. ``I still think that Klein
was a bad appointment,'' he said, ``but what stood in the balance
was the great blow that a loss would have represented for the prime
minister.''
</P>
<P>
   Finance Minister Shochat said Klein's selection ``will defer
growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak gamely called the protracted cabinet discussion ``a
legitimate and democratic debate between differing economic
perspectives.''
</P>
<P>
   Having received the required cabinet endorsement, Klein is to be
sworn in on Monday by President Ezer Weizman to a five-year term.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's nomination of Klein for the bank governorship signaled a
continuing commitment to strict anti-inflation policies at a time
when inflation here has fallen to its lowest level in a generation.
</P>
<P>
   The Central Bureau of Statistics said last Friday that the
cost-of-living index rose just 1.3 percent in 1999, half the United
States rate and the smallest annual increase since 1967.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the base lending rate fixed by the central bank is
a stiff 10.7 percent. Maintaining high real interest rates of 9
percent or more is defended by economists who share the bank's
fears of resurgent inflation, but assailed by industrialists and
politicians who blame the bank's polices for three consecutive
years of flat or lower per-capita incomes.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market jumped several points when Barak announced his
choice, though market analysts said later that stock prices could
suffer if Klein resists pressure to ease interest rates.

WRESTLING GROUP WINS BACK USE OF ITS NAME ON INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Call it ``Domain Name Smackdown.''
</P>
<P>
   The World Wrestling Federation has won back rights to the use of
its name in cyberspace, in the first case testing the new
international forum for resolving disputes over Internet domain
names.
</P>
<P>
   A panel of the World Intellectual Property Organization, an arm
of the United Nations, handed down the ruling Friday against a
California man accused of registering
www.worldwrestlingfederation.com with the sole intent of trying to
resell it to the organization at a ``substantial profit.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first case filed and the first one resolved under a
policy begun late last year by the Internet Corp. for Assigned
Names and Numbers, or Icann, to help settle cases of reported
cybersquatting quickly and cheaply.
</P>
<P>
   And with a decision that was handed down in less than 40 days _
at a cost of a $1,000 filing fee plus lawyers' fees for the
wrestling federation _ all the parties involved said the case
offered proof that the controversial policy could work.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case shows that the policy worked as it was intended,''
Louis Touton, vice president and general counsel of Icann, said.
``Victims of clear cases of cybersquatting should have a quick and
cheap way of protecting themselves from continued abuses.
Traditional court remedies are usually much more expensive and
lengthy, and remedies like this are needed to keep global
electronic commerce running on Internet time.''
</P>
<P>
   The new system, called the Uniform Dispute Resolution Process,
was the first substantive policy put in place by Icann after it was
selected by the Clinton administration to operate the Internet's
domain name system.
</P>
<P>
   The wrestling group, which has owned the trademark on the World
Wrestling Federation for years, took its claim to the World
Intellectual Property Organization arbitration panel Dec. 2, just
days after the new policy was initiated and shortly after the
domain name www.worldwrestlingfederation.com was registered by a
California man through an Australian company.
</P>
<P>
   Six other cases have been filed and many more are expected in
the coming months. Network Solutions, the company that the
government had previously granted a monopoly in the lucrative
business of registering Internet names, had placed more than 1,000
disputed domain names on hold. Those disputes would now fall under
Icann's rules.
</P>
<P>
   The address of the World Wrestling Federation's Web site
currently is www.wwf.com. But Icann recently changed the rules for
domain registrations, allowing names of up to 63 characters, as
opposed to the traditional 22, to be registered. That enabled
Michael Bosman, a California stockbroker, to list the federation's
trademark as an Internet domain.
</P>
<P>
   According to the federation, Bosman contacted it three days
after registering the name, offering to sell it to them ``for a
significant profit.'' Bosman said he had originally registered the
name with the intent of hosting a wrestling fans Web site, but
decided to offer it to the federation after realizing he had
neither the capital nor technical expertise.
</P>
<P>
   Bosman said he had been unaware of the new Icann rules
prohibiting the abusive registration of trademarks until he was hit
with a threat of costly lawsuits, and then a notice of the World
Intellectual Property Organization proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bosman said he was unhappy about having to give up the
name he paid $60 for, he said he was glad he was not forced to hire
a lawyer to fight a lawsuit from the federation, which he said had
threatened to sue him for up to $100,000 in damages.
</P>
<P>
   And he said he felt the WIPO process was fair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a good organization,'' he said. ``They were fair
and unbiased and it didn't cost me a dime.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he conceded, ``I'm the first loser of the domain dispute
process. That's not a real good title to have.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Like most Colombians, Ambassador Luis Alberto
Moreno-Mejia hates his country's reputation among Americans. ``I'm
sure that if you did a poll, the first thing that would come to
mind is the association with cocaine,'' he said. ``It's bad for me,
and it's bad for Colombia. I think the self-esteem of Colombians is
very much hurt when we are perceived this way.''
</P>
<P>
   So last month the 46-year-old diplomat saw an opportunity to
change some minds. His ammunition: 20,000 Colombian roses, in
shades of red, cream, coral, yellow and blush, and the Colombian
actor who plays Juan Valdez, the fictional coffee grower in the
television commercials.
</P>
<P>
   The roses were air-freighted to Washington in time for the
National Symphony Orchestra ball, one of the social events of the
season. The actor was dressed in a poncho and placed at the
entryway to the ballroom, where he handed out vacuum-packed samples
of Colombian coffee to guests including Justice Sandra Day O'Connor
and Louis Freeh, the FBI director.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to remind Washington's decision makers that
Colombia's major export to the United States is not cocaine. It is
petroleum, followed by coffee, followed by cut flowers. ``We wanted
to show people in Washington that Colombia is more than just what
you read in the headlines,'' the ambassador said. And he thinks it
worked. ``I sure hope so,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A more important victory for Moreno-Mejia came last week, when
President Clinton announced a $1.3 billion emergency aid package to
Colombia to help the government of President Andres Pastrana in its
war against narcotics traffickers and the leftist guerrillas who
control much of the cocaine trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Pastrana's inauguration in August 1998 brought to
Colombia a new spirit of hope,'' Clinton said. ``But increased drug
production and trafficking, coupled with a serious economic
recession and sustained violence, have put that progress in
peril.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreno-Mejia said the aid package, which still must be approved
by Congress, was a landmark in relations between Colombia and the
United States, the largest market for Colombian cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider it a turning point because there is a recognition
that there needs to be burden-sharing in this fight,'' he told a
visitor to his office in the Colombia Embassy, where one wall is
dominated by a large portrait of Simon Bolivar, the great
independence hero of Latin America. ``Colombia has suffered
tremendously for many, many years, and it has been in this fight
very much alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreno-Mejia is widely praised in the administration and in
Congress for his tireless lobbying on behalf of Colombia, which is
now the third-largest recipient of U.S. aid, after Israel and
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   A dapper former business executive and television journalist
whose taste in clothing runs to Armani and Hermes, he is the
picture of a modern diplomat. He is as comfortable conversing in
English as in Spanish, just as he seems equally at home in
Washington and in Colombia, which is not surprising since he was a
citizen of both countries until recently.
</P>
<P>
   The ambassador, the oldest of seven children, was born in
Philadelphia, where his father was in medical school at the
University of Pennsylvania. He held both a U.S. and a Colombian
passport until the fall of 1998, when he was named ambassador by
Pastrana, a friend since they attended the same high school in
Colombia. The ambassador attended college and business school in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He was forced to give up his U.S. citizenship shortly after his
diplomatic appointment was announced; U.S. citizens cannot hold
diplomatic immunity in their own country.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled the process: ``You go to the U.S. Embassy and you
say, `I want to renounce my citizenship,' and they put papers in
front of you, and you sign all these papers, and they say, `Why are
you doing this?' And I said, `Well, it's because I want to
represent Colombia in the United States.''' He says he renounced
his U.S. citizenship reluctantly, and sadly.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's new aid package to Colombia appears to
enjoy bipartisan support on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers from both
parties agree it is needed to save that nation of 38 million people
from economic and political collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The drug cartels that dominated the Colombia cocaine industry in
the 1980s have largely disappeared. But they have been replaced by
guerrillas who use the multibillion-dollar cocaine trade to
underwrite their insurgency, which advanced last summer to within
30 miles of the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   Morena-Mejia warns that without the aid package, which includes
money to pay for more than 60 military helicopters for the
Colombian army and police, there will be ``progressive
deterioration.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. military commitment has alarmed human rights groups and
historians who see comparisons between the involvement in Colombia
and what happened in Vietnam a generation ago. But the ambassador
rejects the comparison. ``It's not a military engagement,'' he
said. ``This is a situation in which you're helping Colombia with
the tools so that Colombians can solve their own problems.''
</P>
<P>
   He figures he will need to serve at least another year in
Washington to see the aid package approved and put into effect.
After that, he and his wife, a Venezuelan economist who was her
country's trade minister, plan to return to Colombia. His two
children from a previous marriage _ a 15-year-old son and a
12-year-old daughter _ are in school in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   A return home would be a novelty in his large family.
Morena-Mejia's parents have become U.S. citizens and settled in
Florida, and five of his six siblings also now call the United
States their home. But unlike the rest of his family, he ``always
wanted to be back in Colombia,'' he said. ``The best legacy you can
leave to your children is a sense of country _ and of helping to do
something to improve it.''

during the restoration for masonry and elevator repairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought this structure was just a part of the millennium
fireworks,'' he said, eying the scaffolding as its gauzy mesh
highlights were being removed from the tubular girders.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of sparing the airily pleasing structure, whose night
lighting created what seemed an alabaster glow from the monument's
interior, has been carried forth on a Web page, of course. ``The
obelisk, it turns out, is sort of boring,'' concluded Chad Allen on
www.keepitcovered.org.
</P>
<P>
   ``Join the cover-up,'' he pleaded in Washingtonese.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, one of the chief underwriters of the monument
restoration, Target Stores, is already working to resurrect the
scaffolding at half its current size, scaled down for a park site
near the Minneapolis Institute of Art.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were delighted to be part of a process that brought
something artistic to Washington and now we hope to keep it alive
out here,'' said Jim Hale, a senior vice president for Target
Stores, said by phone from Target's headquarters in Minneapolis.
There, the founding Dayton family of the merchant chain has long
prescribed that the corporation donate five percent of its pretax
income to assorted community projects. Reconfiguring the monument
scaffolding at half-size is already being negotiated with Universal
Builders Supply, which built and owns the 575-foot workers'
filigree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well that's a cool idea, keeping the thing alive,'' said
Andrea Kimsey, touring here with her husband. ``Have a piece of
this out there for people who can't get here.''
</P>
<P>
   The scaffolding resembles a towering glass container for the
monument. Among the attributes that Washington denizens have been
most celebrating is the sheer, spin-free innocence of its statement
in such a political city of now you see it, now you don't. It
seemed part beacon, part exclamation point for moving on from
troubles past.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a delight,'' said Peter B. Kovler, who, as one of the
founding sponsors of the highly popular Franklin Delano Roosevelt
Memorial, knows well the risks here in monumental architecture.
``My hat's off to the people who managed to put aesthetics into
something practical in this city.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's a critic,'' he said without complaint, noting
there can be a certain flexibility, too, along the city's acres of
remembering. Indeed, at the Roosevelt memorial on the east bank of
the Potomac, Kovler's family charity is putting up $1 million to
deal with a running complaint. Robert Graham, in conjunction with
the National Organization on Disabilities, has been commissioned to
create a sculpted rendering of Roosevelt in his wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have complained that the true Roosevelt, the leader who
triumphed from a wheelchair, was not fully on display. Visitors had
to search for the sight of a small caster wheel nearly hidden in
the backdrop of one FDR tableau. The new sculpture, with wheels as
bold as Roosevelt, will be at the entrance to the memorial, most
likely heightening interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risks of a public effort at memory, of a restoration from
memory are all worth it,'' Kovler concluded. ``Now let's see the
success of the restored Washington Monument when the scaffolding
come down.''

AKAMAI TO OPEN CALIFORNIA OFFICE

<TEXT>
<P>
   Akamai Technologies, which had one of last year's hottest
Internet stock offerings, has expanded beyond its base in
Cambridge, Mass., to open an office in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The company provides services that help Web sites perform more
efficiently by directing traffic to the least congested parts of a
network. Web sites that use Akamai's services included ones
operated by Walt Disney, Lycos and The New York Times Co.
</P>
<P>
   Akamai is opening the new office in San Mateo, Calif., partly
because some of its biggest accounts, like Apple Computer and
Yahoo, are nearby. But another goal is to tap the highly trained
labor pool of Silicon Valley, where workers are most likely to have
just the right combination of skills and training the company needs
_ even if they are also more likely to be infected by stock-option
fever than people in the East.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Sagan, Akamai's president, said that the company had hired
more than 25 new engineers in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's harder here in the Valley; they read the options letter
in much more detail,'' Sagan said. ``But you get some really
experienced and Internet-savvy people.''

CHILDREN OF CAMP SURVIVORS PLEDGE TO KEEP THEIR STORIES ALIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOSEPH BERGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ This weekend's conference on the experience of
Jewish displaced persons after World War II teemed with tales,
sometimes zany ones, about the resourcefulness of people who were
left with nothing and, often, no one.
</P>
<P>
   One Holocaust survivor's daughter, Toby Blum Dobkin, read an
account by her father, Boris Blum, of how after Dachau he found
himself in front of a mirror with other inmates still in their
striped uniforms and was so shriveled he could not pick himself
out. ``The person I saw in the mirror was one that I had never seen
before in my life,'' her father wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the next day, he and two friends had enough spirit to
celebrate their freedom by converting a large red cloth they had
scavenged into a red carpet and a feathered hat into a crown and
puckishly pretending they were royalty on parade on the streets of
their tormentors.
</P>
<P>
   The almost 1,000 people here were also struck by the
resourcefulness of the children of those refugees, daughters and
sons like Romana Strochlitz Primus and Menachem Z. Rosensaft who
put together this conference and chose as its theme a period that
they directly experienced, since many of them were born in the 90
camps in Germany, Austria and Italy set up by the Allies for the
DPs, as refugees were known.
</P>
<P>
   And it is the children _ most of them accomplished professionals
whose university educations gave the conference its seminar-like
structure _ who have effectively declared with this conference that
they will pick up the reins of leadership from their aging parents
and keep up the memory and culture of the slaughtered 6 million.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the survivors are now in their late 70s or early 80s
_ the nation's second-largest survivors' community after New York
is now South Florida. Survivor leaders like Miles Lerman and
Benjamin Meed pressed for Holocaust remembrance to become a
50-state phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   A concession to the realities of time was made this weekend when
Lerman, longtime chairman of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council,
the federal organization which governs the museum here and
sponsored the conference, told the audience he was yielding his
chairmanship as soon as President Clinton appoints a successor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time has come,'' he said, ``to begin the process of
passing the torch to a new generation,'' Lerman said.
</P>
<P>
   The survivors' children _ who call themselves Second Generation
or, frivolously, 2G _ have noted how difficult it is to animate an
event 55 years after it occurred, that except in the history books,
few epic tragedies seem to endure beyond the lives of their victims
and perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
   But Elie Wiesel, who delivered a keynote speech in which he
expressed worries that the Holocaust had become ``a fashionable
endeavor,'' thinks the survivors' children are in a privileged
position.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe a person who listens to a witness becomes a
witness,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   A remarkable number of the survivors' children have dedicated
important parts of their lives to keeping alive their parents'
story. Ms. Dobkin, a folklorist born in the Landsberg DP camp,
collects richly textured tales. Sam Norich, born in the Feldafing
DP camp, keeps a Yiddish newspaper alive as general manager of the
Forward Association. Aviva Kempner has made a film about the
partisans of Vilna. Thane Rosenbaum writes post-Holocaust novels
like ``Second Hand Smoke.'' Eva Fogelman, born in the Kassel DP
camp, is a psychologist who runs therapy groups about growing up in
survivor families.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech, Norich recalled that after the death of his mother,
he realized that ``it was now up to me to give her life, that the
genetic and biological relationship between us _ that she had given
me life _ was now reversed.''
</P>
<P>
   The children come at the task from often clashing perspectives.
Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., who was born in Eschwege DP camp,
urged the audience to be alert not just to repression of Jews, but
to repression of others like the Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Such efforts at universalism were not for Melvin Jules Bukiet, a
novelist and professor of literature at Sarah Lawrence College. He
read an introduction to an upcoming anthology of Second Generation
writers, in which he talked of children angrier than their
necessarily adaptive parents, less concerned with the ``insipid
fetish for healing,'' more concerned with the Holocaust's
singularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we rub the world's nose in our misery,'' he said. ``Go to
our museums, go see our movies, go read our books, look at what you
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Bukiet uses the blue number tattooed on his father's arm _
108016 _ as the code to enter his computer and once presented a
novel he wrote to a baffled Helmut Kohl, the former chancellor of
Germany, signed with that number.

JETS WILL BE A PARCELLS TEAM WHETHER OR NOT HE RETURNS TO COACH 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A year ago Monday, the New York Jets took a halftime lead at
Mile High Stadium over the team favored to win the Super Bowl _ the
Denver Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   It was the American Football Conference championship game, and
although the Jets wound up 30 minutes short of the Super Bowl, Jets
players, coaches and fans could see a brighter future 365 days
away.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they wound up short of the playoffs and short of a
coach after starting the season short of an owner and losing a
quarterback in their opening game.
</P>
<P>
   In a matter of days, though, the biggest questions facing the
team should be resolved. The National Football League owners are
expected Tuesday to approve Robert Wood Johnson IV as the Jets' new
owner. Johnson wants to maintain stability and will probably move
quickly in naming a coach, either by persuading Bill Parcells to
return in that role or by appointing Al Groh to the job.
</P>
<P>
   No matter which way that decision goes, Parcells' fingerprints
will probably be seen on the organization and on the field. Groh
has limited administrative experience, so decisions about personnel
and other matters would be overseen by Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   After Johnson is approved as owner, Commissioner Paul Tagliabue
will rule on the status of Bill Belichick, who resigned as Jets
head coach after one day on the job two weeks ago and is trying to
win the right to work elsewhere _ presumably as the coach and
general manager of the New England Patriots. Tagliabue may well
decide that Belichick remains bound to his Jets contract, which
would mean the Patriots would probably give the Jets draft picks in
exchange for Belichick.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells' status remains the biggest mystery. He met with
Johnson for two hours last Friday, the second time they had met in
three days. But at least some of Parcells' assistants were in the
dark on Parcells' plans this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Like everyone else, the Jets players are awaiting the decision,
although they profess not to be overly concerned about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as if people are running around screaming,''
linebacker Chad Cascadden said.
</P>
<P>
   In part, that might be because change is an accepted part of
life in the National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year you lose some of your teammates,'' said the Jets'
backup safety and special-teams star, Chris Hayes, who was a member
of the Super Bowl champion Green Bay Packers three years ago.
``What I learned in this business, playing on a Super Bowl team, is
that it's hard to keep a team together.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayes professes not to be overly concerned about the possibility
of a coaching change, even on a club that was supposed to be a
Super Bowl contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take it that whoever's in there, Bill Parcells will get the
right guy,'' Hayes said. ``I kind of wished Belichick was in there.
He knows the players. He also coached the DBs. So I'm losing a lot
by Bill not being there.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayes said he spoke to Keyshawn Johnson by phone the other day,
and Johnson told him, ``So Belichick's out?'' but that the
conversation then shifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we're out of football we try not to talk football,''
Hayes said. ``When I talked to Keyshawn we didn't try to read
anything into it. I respect this business for what it is _ and
that's strictly business. I don't read into it between the lines
because I know it's not personal.''
</P>
<P>
   Jumbo Elliott believes Parcells might yet come back, calling it
``the popular opinion right now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows who's going to be there and who's going to be part
of important schemes?'' Hayes said. ``Belichick's gone, and he's a
big part of the puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   ``My attitude is if you want to go to the Super Bowl, you go
with Parcells _ and if he doesn't want to go, he'll find someone
who does.''

METS' HAMPTON DEVELOPED THE WILL TO WIN FROM HIS DEMANDING FATHER 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The wicked line drive shocked the 7-year-old pitcher, who
quickly raised his glove yet still missed the ball. It struck his
nose and blood oozed out of each nostril. He looked to the dugout,
where his father instructed him to go to the water fountain, wipe
away the blood and return to the mound. That is what Mike Hampton
did.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, Hampton, who might have been recuperating
with an ice pack and a teddy bear if he were any other 7-year-old,
was pitching again for the Phillies in the Homosassa, Fla., Little
League. That is the way Mike Sr. raised him and the way Mike Jr.
wanted to be raised.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had a chance to pick the perfect son, I probably would
have come up with Michael,'' said the father. ``He is everything
that I wanted to be. It might be a bad thing to say, but I was
going to make him be a ballplayer one way or the other.''
</P>
<P>
   The son listened intently to his father's daily lectures about
second place being the first loser, about working harder and longer
than everyone and about remaining respectful while surpassing
others to pursue his sports dreams. Never rebellious, the devoted
son always acquiesced.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew the harder he pushed me, the more I'd want to do it
and the more I'd push myself,'' said Hampton. ``It was a lot harder
than most people would push their kids or anyone else. I owe my
competitiveness and drive to him. He pushed me to do everything as
hard as I could.''
</P>
<P>
   The pushing, the nudging, the guiding, the cajoling, the
encouraging has never stopped between Big Mike and Little Mike, the
nicknames that still cling to the two men like Velcro. Big Mike is
still the voice of God to his son, the voice that Little Mike has
heard throughout his 27 years. The voice that he will continue to
hear now that he is the ace starter for the Mets, after being
snared from the Houston Astros in a trade last month.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Big Mike what the Mets will receive from Little Mike and he
offers a scouting report that does not mention Hampton's cut
fastball or his 22-4 record last season. He talks about the
intangibles of a pitcher who is unlike any in the major leagues, a
tremendous athlete who happens to be a terrific pitcher. Brad
Ausmus, Detroit's All-Star catcher and one of Hampton's former
teammates, told Big Mike that Little Mike is the first left-handed
starter he would pick if he was starting a new franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't pitch for a victory, he pitches to win,'' Ausmus
said. ``Some players never learn that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton slides forcefully into second to break up double plays,
he hustles out grounders like a rookie, he will be one of the
faster players on the team and he has the talent to be one of the
Mets' best defensive outfielders. Seriously. Hampton sometimes gets
to the ballpark at 7:30 a.m. to work out before day games and he
always wears spikes in the dugout, in case the team needs a
pinch-runner or a pinch-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I go out there, I'm doing whatever it takes to help my
team win,'' said Hampton. ``If that means taking one off the face
or jumping in front of a ball or hitting or getting hit with a
pitch, I'll do it. That goes back to the way I was raised to win at
all costs.''
</P>
<P>
   When Michael William Hampton was born in Brooksville, Fla., on
Sept. 9, 1972, his father was 19 and his mother, Joan, was 16. Big
Mike, who laments how he did not pursue a sports career, pursued it
through his son and said the two ``grew up together.'' The younger
Hampton was walking at 8 months old and was separated from other
5-year-olds in school and placed with 8-year-olds because he threw
too hard. As an eighth grader, Hampton predicted that he would
become a professional athlete. Hampton's friends giggled. His
father smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he believed,'' Mike Sr. said, ``I had to believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Joan Hampton watched Big Mike control Little Mike and often
cringed. She was the one who hugged her crying son when his father
pulled him off the field or made him sit by himself in the car for
not hustling. She was the one whose car Little Mike fled to after a
rare shabby performance. She was the one who unsuccessfully asked
her husband to relax his strict methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough to see, but he was preparing him for what his
life is like today,'' she said. ``Michael wouldn't have made it if
he just had my heart and my easygoing way. I'd cry if somebody
booed me. He needed to have that toughness and that stubbornness.
He would not be where he is without his dad.''
</P>
<P>
   Big Mike is an assistant coach under Joe Buccheri at Crystal
River High School, the job he accepted when his son was a freshman.
Buccheri, a native of Flushing, N.Y., and a former batting practice
pitcher for the St. Louis Cardinals, called Hampton ``the most
gifted athlete'' he has even seen.
</P>
<P>
   Little Mike could dunk a basketball, he could bench-press 300
pounds, he could do back and front flips like a gymnast and he was
such a good defensive back that Notre Dame, Miami and Florida State
recruited him.
</P>
<P>
   Worried about the perception that he might be showing his son
favoritism, Big Mike kept challenging an athlete who was twice
named all-state in football and baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike was real hard on Michael, but they were still like
brothers,'' said Buccheri.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Hampton loved tackling players and ``looking in
their eyes and realizing you got them,'' he picked baseball over
football. At 5 feet 10 inches and 170 pounds, Hampton knew he would
have to add bulk to play college football and that would destroy
his flexibility as a pitcher. While Hampton was cocky, he was
realistic. His father taught him about realism, too.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Big Mike owns Cedar Key Fish and Oyster Co. and he made his son
work for him when Little Mike turned 15. The younger Hampton hated
it. His father would rap on his bedroom door at 6:30 a.m. on a
Saturday to wake him for work. Tired from a Friday night game,
Little Mike waited to see if his father would leave him behind, but
he never did. So Hampton gutted, filleted, packed and froze fish
for $4.50 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``He taught me that I didn't want to do that,'' said Hampton.
``Not only was it hard, I couldn't stand smelling like that. You
didn't get that smell off in one night.''
</P>
<P>
   Between laughs over Little Mike's memories of handling fish, Big
Mike said his strategy succeeded and a lesson was learned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted him to work to achieve his goals so he wouldn't have
to do this kind of work,'' Big Mike said.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton, who was drafted out of high school in the sixth round
by Seattle in 1990, made it to the majors with the Mariners when he
was 20. After failing to please Manager Lou Piniella, he was traded
to Houston after the 1993 season, broke into the Astro rotation in
1995 and went 48-21 over the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   He might be one of the top five starters in baseball, but
Hampton still peers over his shoulder and hopes. The new Met would
love it if Manager Bobby Valentine took the baseball from him one
day and asked him to retreat 300 feet and chase fly balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could give up pitching right now to go play in the
outfield, I'd do it in a heartbeat,'' Hampton said. ``But I pitch
better than I can hit or play the outfield.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton credited his .311 batting average of last season to
being fed fastballs. Hampton said he would hit in the .200s with
intense practice, but he added, ``but I'd hustle and do other
things and make you want me on your team.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Dierker, the Astros manager, said, ``I think if he had
tried for a career in baseball as an outfielder, he would have made
it to the majors.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton made it as a pitcher, a plan his father devised when
Little Mike was still in diapers. When Big Mike was asked if he
felt that he had ever been too difficult on his son, he quickly
answered no. He was stern yet supportive, demanding yet loving. He
decided his son would be a major leaguer and then Big Mike and
Little Mike worked together to achieve that dream, a dual dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell what he did for me,'' said Hampton Sr., his voice
quivering. ``He sent me a bat when he made it to the majors and he
wrote on it, `To my Dad, all I ever want to be and more.' I told
him that having a son who feels that way about me means more to me
than anything in the world.''  &QL;

LABOR MOBILIZES TO SUPPORT GORE IN IOWA 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Al Gore can be thankful that this state is
more than an unending field of corn.
</P>
<P>
   Punctuating the prairies that most Americans see as the essence
of this state are dozens of industrial plants that serve the
agricultural economy, and the heavily unionized work force in these
farm-equipment factories and meat-packing plants is a major factor
behind the Gore camp's confidence that the vice president will win
Iowa's Jan. 24 caucuses, the first big test in this year's
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In Iowa's caucuses, success traditionally turns on who has the
best organization, and the state's 150,000-member labor movement,
because it is so big and well organized, gives Gore an extra weapon
to use against his Democratic rival, former Sen. Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``The role of labor in this thing is huge,'' said David Yepsen,
the chief political reporter for The Des Moines Register. ``They've
always been a big player in the caucuses. They're a key
constituency in the Democratic Party here.''
</P>
<P>
   Notwithstanding labor's dismay at the Clinton administration's
trade policies, Iowa's union movement has gone into overdrive in
the past two weeks in an attempt to give Gore a convincing caucus
victory. With the AFL-CIO having endorsed Gore in October, over the
opposition of the Teamsters and Autoworkers, the Iowa caucuses are
shaping up as a major test not just for Gore but for John Sweeney,
the labor federation's president.
</P>
<P>
   To pump up turnout, Sweeney's foot soldiers have telephoned more
than 30,000 union members who are registered Democrats. The
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees has
sent four separate pro-Gore mailings to its 12,000 members in the
state _ and the AFL-CIO has done three additional mailings to union
members. The organization has even mailed 30,000 five-minute videos
in which Sweeney urges union members to participate in the
caucuses, while telling them, ``Al Gore is America's foremost
champion of today's unions.''
</P>
<P>
   But labor's push has stumbled into two formidable problems. Two
of the state's biggest unions _ the Autoworkers and the Teamsters _
are not campaigning for Gore and have asked the AFL-CIO not to urge
their members to back the vice president. Second, many union
members cannot get excited about Gore and seem to care more about
Monday night football than about the Monday night caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm leaning toward Gore, but I'm getting tired of the whole
process,'' said Gary Mobley, a member of the United Steelworkers of
America who said he would not attend a caucus. ``This is all taking
place far too long before the election.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, at the state AFL-CIO's aging, brick headquarters, a
half-dozen union members _ working at a phone bank beneath the
original, century-old charter that Samuel Gompers signed to set up
Iowa's labor federation _ were using one of the oldest tricks in
labor's electoral playbook. (They were also following one of
Gompers' maxims: ``Stand faithfully by our friends and elect
them.'')
</P>
<P>
   First, the callers asked the hundreds of union members they
contacted whether they supported Gore or Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   If the union members said they backed Bradley, the callers said
``Thank you'' and hung up. But if the union members favored Gore,
they were encouraged to attend the caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   And if Gore supporters said they would miss the caucuses because
they had to attend a child's basketball game or swim meet, the
callers turned on the hard sell, warning that missing the caucuses
was tantamount to voting against Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much harder to get people to go out to the caucuses than
to vote in a primary,'' said Mark Smith, the chain-smoking former
economics professor who is president of the state's AFL-CIO.
``You're asking people to make a two-hour commitment at a school or
somewhere when the wind chill might be 46 below.''
</P>
<P>
   The youngest generation of union members is hardly familiar with
the process, because labor has not shepherded its flocks to the
caucuses since 1984, the last time the AFL-CIO endorsed a candidate
in the Democratic presidential primaries. That year, labor backed
Vice President Walter Mondale over Sen. Gary Hart.
</P>
<P>
   At this year's 2,142 precinct caucuses, to be held in schools,
town halls and homes, Iowans will be asked to move to one part of a
room to show support for their candidate. To familiarize union
members with this awkward process, the AFL-CIO is organizing mock
caucuses in Cedar Rapids, Davenport, Waterloo and 10 other cities.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said that 100,000 of Iowa's union members are registered
to vote, 20,000 as Republicans, 30,000 as independents and 50,000
as Democrats, accounting for one-tenth of Iowa's Democrats. But by
mobilizing their masses, labor officials hope union members will
represent far more than one-tenth of the participants in the
Democratic caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said that when Democratic union members were polled about
candidates, 50 percent said they were undecided or gave no answer,
30 percent backed Gore, 15 percent supported Bradley and 5 percent
favored others, ranging from Jesse Jackson to Pat Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Labor's program, Smith explained, is straightforward, to remind
union members that Gore has backed labor on many issues, opposing
Medicare cuts, backing a higher minimum wage, refusing to cross a
picket line during a strike at ABC. The next step is to mobilize
Gore supporters to attend the caucuses, an effort that has involved
shop stewards talking to workers and knocking on union members'
doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no magic bullet,'' Smith said. ``It's like Woody
Hayes, the Ohio State football coach, used to say, `Three yards and
a cloud of dust.' You don't have to dream up anything fancy.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Labor's pro-Gore push has revved up many members. Mark Rocha, a
service delivery coordinator with US West, said he would definitely
support Gore. ``The vice president has always been an ally of the
Communications Workers, on family issues, on the right to
organize,'' he said. ``True, he doesn't knock my socks off, but I'm
not looking for that. He's upbeat. He's strong.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's union leaders voice confidence that labor will make
an impressive caucus showing _ and the Bradley campaign has
acknowledged as much, perhaps to lower expectations for Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Labor has the potential to make a big difference,'' said Eric
Hauser, spokesman for the Bradley campaign. ``Their organized clout
is real. Senator Bradley tried to get their attention and support,
but they went the other way. We respect that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has periodically visited Iowa union halls in the hope of
reaching out directly to members. But his efforts have been
undercut by several union mailings that have hammered him, accusing
him of supporting school vouchers and raising the age for Social
Security _ accusations that the Bradley campaign says are
inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   Notwithstanding their attacks on Bradley, union leaders say
their members are generally fond of the New Jerseyan and would have
little problem backing him if he wins the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Gore doesn't survive the process, we'll endorse someone
else and rally the troops for that person,'' said Dan Albritton,
the steelworkers' political director for Iowa. ``If it's Bradley
vs. George W. Bush, it's easy, because there are such clear-cut
differences. Bush is totally anti-labor as far as I'm concerned. We
wouldn't have problems getting our people fired up if the dog
catcher ran against George W. Bush.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, winds exceeded 100 miles an hour at Cannon Beach along
the Oregon coast as a tightly wound low pressure system moved into
western Canada. Monday, a weaker low center and its attendant cold
front will approach the Northwest coast, bringing windswept rain to
coastal Washington and Oregon. Farther inland, the moist Pacific
air will cool as it ascends the Cascades, setting the stage for
heavy snow above 3,000 feet. Snow showers will also pepper many of
the west-facing mountain slopes of the northern Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a plume of moisture originating from the central
Pacific Ocean will send a thick shield of clouds Monday into the
Southwest. Spotty light showers will fall from southern California
to western Colorado. Farther east, mild conditions will stretch
from southern New Mexico to the western Gulf Coast as the jet
stream retreats to the north. Indeed, amid ample sunshine many
places will surpass 70 degrees Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Snow will end Monday across eastern Maine as a strengthening
storm grinds toward the Canadian Maritimes. A formidable pressure
difference between the low and polar high pressure over Ontario
will promote gusty winds across the Northeast. Wind speeds will be
highest over eastern New England where gusts will exceed 65 miles
an hour. It will also be bitterly cold across the region.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, warm, humid air ascending a dome of chilly air along
the ground will cause patchy freezing rain and sleet near the
southern Ohio and middle Mississippi Valleys. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: THE POWER OF WIND
</P>
<P>
   Strong winds from the northwest will blow over New England
Monday, causing a hazard for drivers of high-profile vehicles,
especially those traveling north or south. When the wind blows, it
exerts a force on a given area of an object. As the wind increases,
its force increases as the square of the wind speed. That is, the
force per unit area of a wind of 20 mph is four times greater than
the force of a wind of 10 mph Thus, the total force exerted on a
vehicle which has a high profile and thus a large area can become
mighty when crosswinds are strong, causing the driver to possibly
lose control of the vehicle. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ This weekend's conference on the experience of
Jewish displaced persons after World War II teemed with tales,
sometimes zany ones, about the resourcefulness of people who were
left with nothing and, often, no one.
</P>
<P>
   One Holocaust survivor's daughter, Toby Blum Dobkin, read an
account by her father, Boris Blum, of how after Dachau he found
himself in front of a mirror with other inmates still in their
striped uniforms and was so shriveled he could not pick himself
out. ``The person I saw in the mirror was one that I had never seen
before in my life,'' her father wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the next day, he and two friends had enough spirit to
celebrate their freedom by converting a large red cloth they had
scavenged into a red carpet and a feathered hat into a crown and
puckishly pretending they were royalty on parade on the streets of
their tormentors.
</P>
<P>
   The almost 1,000 people here were also struck by the
resourcefulness of the children of those refugees, daughters and
sons like Romana Strochlitz Primus and Menachem Z. Rosensaft who
put together this conference and chose as its theme a period that
they directly experienced, since many of them were born in the 90
camps in Germany, Austria and Italy set up by the Allies for the
DPs, as refugees were known.
</P>
<P>
   And it is the children _ most of them accomplished professionals
whose university educations gave the conference its seminar-like
structure _ who have effectively declared with this conference that
they will pick up the reins of leadership from their aging parents
and keep up the memory and culture of the slaughtered 6 million.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the survivors are now in their late 70s or early 80s
_ the nation's second-largest survivors' community after New York
is now South Florida. Survivor leaders like Miles Lerman and
Benjamin Meed pressed for Holocaust remembrance to become a
50-state phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   A concession to the realities of time was made this weekend when
Lerman, longtime chairman of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council,
the federal organization which governs the museum here and
sponsored the conference, told the audience he was yielding his
chairmanship as soon as President Clinton appoints a successor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time has come,'' he said, ``to begin the process of
passing the torch to a new generation,'' Lerman said.
</P>
<P>
   The survivors' children _ who call themselves Second Generation
or, frivolously, 2G _ have noted how difficult it is to animate an
event 55 years after it occurred, that except in the history books,
few epic tragedies seem to endure beyond the lives of their victims
and perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
   But Elie Wiesel, who delivered a keynote speech in which he
expressed worries that the Holocaust had become ``a fashionable
endeavor,'' thinks the survivors' children are in a privileged
position.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe a person who listens to a witness becomes a
witness,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   A remarkable number of the survivors' children have dedicated
important parts of their lives to keeping alive their parents'
story. Ms. Dobkin, a folklorist born in the Landsberg DP camp,
collects richly textured tales. Sam Norich, born in the Feldafing
DP camp, keeps a Yiddish newspaper alive as general manager of the
Forward Association. Aviva Kempner has made a film about the
partisans of Vilna. Thane Rosenbaum writes post-Holocaust novels
like ``Second Hand Smoke.'' Eva Fogelman, born in the Kassel DP
camp, is a psychologist who runs therapy groups about growing up in
survivor families.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech, Norich recalled that after the death of his mother,
he realized that ``it was now up to me to give her life, that the
genetic and biological relationship between us _ that she had given
me life _ was now reversed.''
</P>
<P>
   The children come at the task from often clashing perspectives.
Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., who was born in Eschwege DP camp,
urged the audience to be alert not just to repression of Jews, but
to repression of others like the Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Such efforts at universalism were not for Melvin Jules Bukiet, a
novelist and professor of literature at Sarah Lawrence College. He
read an introduction to an upcoming anthology of Second Generation
writers, in which he talked of children angrier than their
necessarily adaptive parents, less concerned with the ``insipid
fetish for healing,'' more concerned with the Holocaust's
singularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we rub the world's nose in our misery,'' he said. ``Go to
our museums, go see our movies, go read our books, look at what you
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Bukiet uses the blue number tattooed on his father's arm _
108016 _ as the code to enter his computer and once presented a
novel he wrote to a baffled Helmut Kohl, the former chancellor of
Germany, signed with that number.

   And it is the children _ most of them accomplished professionals
whose university educations gave the conference its seminar-like
structure _ who have effectively declared with this conference that
they will pick up the reins of leadership from their aging parents
and keep up the memory and culture of the slaughtered 6 million.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the survivors are now in their late 70s or early 80s
_ the nation's second-largest survivors' community after New York
is now South Florida. Survivor leaders like Miles Lerman and
Benjamin Meed pressed for Holocaust remembrance to become a
50-state phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   A concession to the realities of time was made this weekend when
Lerman, longtime chairman of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council,
the federal organization which governs the museum here and
sponsored the conference, told the audience he was yielding his
chairmanship as soon as President Clinton appoints a successor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time has come,'' he said, ``to begin the process of
passing the torch to a new generation,'' Lerman said.
</P>
<P>
   The survivors' children _ who call themselves Second Generation
or, frivolously, 2G _ have noted how difficult it is to animate an
event 55 years after it occurred, that except in the history books,
few epic tragedies seem to endure beyond the lives of their victims
and perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
   But Elie Wiesel, who delivered a keynote speech in which he
expressed worries that the Holocaust had become ``a fashionable
endeavor,'' thinks the survivors' children are in a privileged
position.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe a person who listens to a witness becomes a
witness,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   A remarkable number of the survivors' children have dedicated
important parts of their lives to keeping alive their parents'
story. Ms. Dobkin, a folklorist born in the Landsberg DP camp,
collects richly textured tales. Sam Norich, born in the Feldafing
DP camp, keeps a Yiddish newspaper alive as general manager of the
Forward Association. Aviva Kempner has made a film about the
partisans of Vilna. Thane Rosenbaum writes post-Holocaust novels
like ``Second Hand Smoke.'' Eva Fogelman, born in the Kassel DP
camp, is a psychologist who runs therapy groups about growing up in
survivor families.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech, Norich recalled that after the death of his mother,
he realized that ``it was now up to me to give her life, that the
genetic and biological relationship between us _ that she had given
me life _ was now reversed.''
</P>
<P>
   The children come at the task from often clashing perspectives.
Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., who was born in Eschwege DP camp,
urged the audience to be alert not just to repression of Jews, but
to repression of others like the Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Such efforts at universalism were not for Melvin Jules Bukiet, a
novelist and professor of literature at Sarah Lawrence College. He
read an introduction to an upcoming anthology of Second Generation
writers, in which he talked of children angrier than their
necessarily adaptive parents, less concerned with the ``insipid
fetish for healing,'' more concerned with the Holocaust's
singularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we rub the world's nose in our misery,'' he said. ``Go to
our museums, go see our movies, go read our books, look at what you
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Bukiet uses the blue number tattooed on his father's arm _
108016 _ as the code to enter his computer and once presented a
novel he wrote to a baffled Helmut Kohl, the former chancellor of
Germany, signed with that number.

BUSH PUTS SMALL IOWA TOWN ON THE MAP _ FOR A DAY, AT LEAST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa, Neb.)  (mk) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RED OAK, Iowa _ Word of the big visit leaked days ago. ``I heard
rumblings on the street last week,'' said Jan Castle Renander,
editor of the weekly Red Oak Express.
</P>
<P>
   By Monday she had it nailed down, and on Tuesday ran the news at
the top of the front page: ``George W. Bush Coming to Red Oak.'' On
Wednesday, John Gambs, a government teacher at Red Oak High School,
decided that he would push back final exams so that his students
could meet the candidate. And all day Thursday, Jerry Dietz, owner
of and on-air talent for the FM radio station KCSI, was busy
beating the drums, telling listeners he would be at the event, and
they might want to be, too.
</P>
<P>
   So by the time Bush and his entourage rolled off Route 48 on
Friday and into this welcoming little town dotted with Victorian
houses and ringed by cornfields and cattle farms, Red Oak was
primed. The Gold Auditorium on the county fairgrounds was festooned
with Bush posters, and every seat in the hall was taken. Mayor
Karen Blue was there, wearing a Bush sticker. Ms. Renander's
husband, Clayton, was there too, having put off feeding the calves
to attend, and so was Dietz's camera-toting assistant, Barb Allen,
who chased after her teenage son Brayton, trying to get him in a
picture with the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   To the members of the Bush team and the journalists following
them, the visit might have been all but indistinguishable from 100
other campaign stops: a not particularly noteworthy media event.
But for the people of Red Oak, a town of 6,200 in the hilly farm
belt of southwest Iowa, the visit had a deeper impact. It was a
moment that made them feel part of a larger process and one they
hoped somehow would reflect well on their community in the eyes of
a nation that ordinarily does not pay them much attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``To a town like ours, this is a very big deal,'' said Ms.
Renander, whose yellowing front-page story about a 1987 visit to
Red Oak by Bush's father, then the vice president, hangs on the
wall of Gambs' classroom. ``It's seeing him in the flesh, saving
the clip from the paper _ something to tell the kids about later
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Red Oak doesn't make much news. Tucked into a rural corridor,
and closer to Omaha, Neb., than to Des Moines, Iowa, the town is
something of a media afterthought in the coverage of events like
the Iowa caucuses. The state paper, The Des Moines Register,
stopped home delivery here a few years ago; it is the Nebraska
television stations that Red Oak antennas pick up. ``The joke
around here is no one sees a reporter from The Register unless
there's bad news,'' Ms. Renander said.
</P>
<P>
   No one sees a candidate very often, either. ``Sometimes, we'll
get a wife,'' Gambs said. It's understandable, then, that while Des
Moines or even Davenport might greet the arrival of a national
office-seeker these days with a bit of a yawn, Red Oak is more
prone to gasp.
</P>
<P>
   And especially when the candidate is from a well-known
Republican family. Red Oak is, after all, a robustly Republican
town, the seat of largely Republican Montgomery County, which went
for Bob Dole in 1996, when Iowa as a whole went for Bill Clinton.
It is a profoundly patriotic place, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is George W. Bush country,'' George Maher, a banker and
lifelong resident, observed as he took a visitor around, showing
off the Red Oak sights. He drove past the old country club and the
new YMCA going up; the old factory where Thomas Murphy Co. made the
nation's first illustrated calendars in the 1890s, and the newer
plants manufacturing automotive parts and prefabricated windows and
turning corn into tortilla flour for a Mexican business.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if Bush is a kind of unofficial favorite son here _ ``The
people I know who are backing him are some of the leaders of the
community,'' Mayor Blue said _ Red Oak is having a slightly more
difficult time working up much enthusiasm for the contest. The town
has its share of worries. The prices for corn and hogs are severely
depressed, and a steady drain of young people has left the area
with one of the state's grayest populations. But the county's
unemployment rate is 2 percent, the offices and plants are
virtually full, and a $10 million bond issue was recently passed
for a new elementary school wing and high school technology lab.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Red Oak is feeling pretty good about itself, not
exactly the atmosphere for political introspection or discontent.
``I don't sense that anyone is what I would call excited,'' Gambs
said. Ms. Blue added that since ``everything is going pretty well,
except agricultural prices,'' the race is ``still peripheral. And
the process starts so far in advance, it's hard to stir up interest
and keep it going.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Bell, assistant manager of the Tru Value hardware store on
Route 48, said he saw pluses and minuses in each of the Republican
contenders, and seemed to be looking for something more. He said he
found Bush likable, favored Steve Forbes' flat tax proposal and
respected John McCain's war record. ``If only we could pull the
good things out of each of them and put them together in one man,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   But for one day, anyway, the presidency as far as Red Oak was
concerned was a one-man race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard many, many comments about how lucky we are that
he's coming to Red Oak,'' said Jeanette Peterson, a member of a
local Republican women's group. The crowd for the candidate's 8:30
a.m. arrival began gathering in the auditorium an hour before. And
by the time Bush, in a crisp blue suit and red tie, walked briskly
up to the podium and, framed by a mural depicting an Iowa farm,
began to speak, 500 faces were staring back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here in Red Oak askin' for the vote,'' Bush said, with a
bit more country in his voice than can be detected in his
television commercials. ``I'm askin' for you to do your duty.''
</P>
<P>
   He drew applause after he said that being a mother was the
toughest job in America, and again when he said, ``I trust the
people of Iowa to make the right decisions for the children of
Iowa.''
</P>
<P>
   Gambs thought he had done pretty well. ``He's much better on the
stump than he is in the debates, isn't he?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd swarmed Bush afterward. He stayed in the hall for
another hour or so, posing for pictures and autographing posters.
Andrea Jensen, a senior in Gambs' government class, was surprised
by her own reaction. ``I didn't think he'd be that funny,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, Ms. Renander headed back to The Express, with
her notes and her camera, and Dietz, who broadcast live from the
Gold Auditorium, pulled up the duct tape that had secured his cable
to the floor. Bush and his retinue, meanwhile, motored on to
Glenwood, another Iowa town that does not find its name much in the
out-of-town papers.

BARAK DELAYS THIRD WEST BANK TRANSFER, ANGERING PALESTINIANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ After Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel decided to
postpone a withdrawal from the West Bank due to take place later
this week, senior Palestinian officials reacted Sunday by
condemning the Israelis, saying they were souring the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, who is scheduled to leave Tuesday for Washington to
resume peace talks with Syria, told his cabinet Sunday that he
would attend to the land transfer on his return. Officials said the
prime minister had not had sufficient time to review the maps and
present them to his cabinet for approval before leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with that explanation, Barak's postponement heightened
Palestinians' concerns that the Israeli-Syrian peace negotiations
would adversely affect them. Some Palestinians fear that Israeli
officials and American mediators will be distracted and that their
peace track will be relegated to second-class status.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a senior Israeli official, in discussing the delay
Sunday night, said, ``You have to take into consideration the
Syrian track. It takes our energy.''
</P>
<P>
   The land transfer was supposed to take place on Thursday under
the interim peace agreement signed last September in Sharm el
Sheik, Egypt. It was to have been the third and final Israeli
withdrawal under the interim agreement, giving the Palestinians
full or partial control over about 40 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision is totally rejected, and it is a blow to all our
attempts to create a partnership,'' said Saeb Erekat, a Palestinian
negotiator. He added that the Israelis did not consult with the
Palestinians, despite regular talks between the two sides, but made
a ``unilateral decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Israelis and Palestinians have been speculating that the Israeli
government might include some Arab neighborhoods just outside
Jerusalem in the next withdrawal. If true, this would make the land
transfer a sensitive political issue for Barak.
</P>
<P>
   In the view of many Israelis, giving back land near Jerusalem
under the interim agreement would be premature since the final
status of Jerusalem is under negotiation in the permanent peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
   With Jerusalem as one of the most complex issues before them,
Israelis and Palestinians are heading into an intensive period of
negotiations to hammer out a framework agreement for final peace by
Feb. 13. It is another deadline that may well end up being
postponed.
</P>
<P>
   At different moments, both Israelis and Palestinians have
accused each other of stalling the framework negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   In postponing this withdrawal, Barak seems to be inching closer
to the position he put forth last summer _ that the third
withdrawal should take place in mid-February. Before the Sharm el
Sheik agreement was signed, Barak unsuccessfully tried to persuade
Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, to link the third withdrawal
with the successful completion of a framework agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But Arafat did not agree, and a Jan. 20 deadline was set for the
third withdrawal. The prime minister's office said Sunday that when
the Sharm el Sheik agreement was signed, the Palestinians also
verbally agreed that a three-week extension would be acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to make sure it happened before the framework
agreement, and this will be the case,'' said Gadi Baltiansky,
Barak's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barak doesn't intend to violate the Sharm agreement,'' he
added. ``But Barak wants to see the overall picture first.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat is flying to the United States this week, too, to meet
with President Clinton and to present him with the Palestinian
outline for the final status. It is possible that there will also
be a three-way meeting with the Israelis, to discuss where final
negotiations stand.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials said Barak did not want to risk a miniature
crisis with the Palestinians before that meeting, in the event
there was a dispute about the territory Israel selected for the
land transfer.
</P>
<P>
   The second withdrawal was significantly delayed because of a
bitter disagreement over the maps, but took place earlier this
month.

FOR U.S. BUDGET, THE BIGGER THE SURPLUS, THE BIGGER THE FIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: N.M., Ohio, Miss., S.C.)   (jw) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress and the Clinton administration are heading
into another battle over taxes and spending, with a bigger pot of
money on the table, no consensus on how to use it and election year
politics complicating the prospects for any compromise.
</P>
<P>
   The outlines of the fight are sure to be similar to the
standoffs of the last few years, with Republicans pressing for tax
cuts, Democrats proposing spending programs and both sides happy to
end up on the middle ground of using the federal budget surplus to
reduce the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   But the battle this year is likely to be magnified by two
factors: official projections to be released in the next few weeks
that members of both parties said would show the surplus growing
significantly larger relative to last year's estimates, and the
attention focused on fiscal politics by the presidential campaign,
where the leading candidates are setting out starkly different
views of how the nation should use its prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an awfully big piggy bank for people to play with this
year,'' said Richard May, a former Republican staff director for
the House Budget Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The first budget tussle of the legislative year is likely to be
over how big a surplus the nation should count on over the next
decade. Some Republicans want to use one set of numbers that show a
particularly sharp increase over previous surplus projections,
reflecting the flood of revenues into the Treasury as the economy
continues roaring along.
</P>
<P>
   By some preliminary estimates circulating on Capitol Hill, the
portion of the surplus generated by non-Social Security tax
receipts could amount to almost $2 trillion over the next decade
using the arithmetic favored by those Republicans, nearly twice the
10-year projection made last year. Such projections assume that
annually appropriated spending would be cut by tens of billions of
dollars this year and then frozen for the next decade, an
assumption that Democrats consider politically preposterous.
</P>
<P>
   Queasy about the prospect of calling for big spending cuts in an
election year, other Republicans, including Sen. Pete Domenici of
New Mexico, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, are
considering adopting another set of assumptions under which
spending would be frozen more or less at current levels. Such a
step would result in a somewhat lower surplus estimate than the
projection that starts with the assumption of a spending cut.
</P>
<P>
   The White House and many Democrats in Congress would prefer to
calculate the surplus after accounting for anticipated and
already-agreed-to spending increases, yielding a surplus estimate
likely to be hundreds of billions of dollars less than either
Republican version over the next decade, Democrats said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that the surplus projections will be increasing
rather than decreasing, and by a fairly significant amount,'' said
Rep. John Spratt Jr., D-S.C., the senior Democrat on the House
Budget Committee. ``But we have to make everyone understand the
underlying assumptions, which are not realistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is likely to be a related fight over whether Congress
and the administration should formally drop the spending limits
that were adopted a decade ago to help deal with huge budget
deficits. Congress evaded the spending caps the last two years
through use of accounting gimmicks amid a tacit understanding on
both sides that the limits at their current levels were not
politically sustainable in an era of swelling surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats who have been briefed on the White House's plans said
President Clinton was willing to propose scrapping the existing
caps, scheduled to expire in 2002. But Clinton would insist that
the old caps be replaced with new, higher limits that would be
extended through the rest of the decade, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials declined to comment on their plan. But
they made little secret of their position that the current caps had
little value given the way Congress had maneuvered around them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans clearly shredded the budget caps last year
with gimmicks and sleight of hand,'' said Gene Sperling, the White
House economic policy adviser. Clinton's budget, he said, will have
``a straightforward, fiscally disciplined path that will ensure we
pay off the national debt within 15 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Republican leaders, including Domenici and Rep. John Kasich
of Ohio, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, have signaled
that they are open to a deal on resetting the caps, especially if
Clinton takes the first step.
</P>
<P>
   But they face potential resistance from their party's more
conservative members, who are sure to object to anything that
smacks of a retreat from fiscal discipline, especially in an
election year.
</P>
<P>
   Congress made little headway last year in shifting from a system
set up to reduce budget deficits to creating a new system to deal
with the prospect of long-running surpluses. The main mechanism for
fiscal discipline was a pledge by both parties not to touch any of
the portion of the surplus generated by Social Security. The Social
Security surplus was projected last year to be $2 trillion over 10
years, and is likely to be even higher under new projections to be
issued by the Congressional Budget Office on Jan. 26.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Republican-led Congress passed a budget for the
current fiscal year that appeared to spend all of the non-Social
Security surplus and to dip $17 billion into the Social Security
trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   But the strong economy now appears to be generating enough
unanticipated tax revenue to get the Republicans off the hook. In a
letter last week to Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the majority leader,
Domenici said new calculations by the budget committee showed that
the government would not have to use any Social Security money in
the current year, and indeed would run a non-Social Security
surplus of up to $20 billion.
</P>
<P>
   With the surplus continuing to pile up, Republicans remain as
committed as ever to tax cuts. In the House, Kasich is developing a
plan under which he would reserve most of the non-Social Security
surplus for tax cuts or debt reduction to thwart an end-of-session
spending binge.
</P>
<P>
   The result could well be another stalemate, in which some money
goes to additional spending and the rest goes to reducing the
national debt but neither side gets any major legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a post-impeachment environment in which Republicans
don't work with Democrats,'' said Stanley Collender, managing
director of the Federal Budget Consulting Group at Fleishman
Hillard, a public relations firm. ``And you're in an election year
where Democrats think they have a shot at taking over at least the
House and are not going to want to give the Republicans anything
they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet some members of both parties take seriously the prospect of
a bipartisan deal. They are talking about tradeoffs under which
Republicans would get limited tax cuts, such as a reduction in the
so-called marriage penalty paid by many two-income couples, while
Democrats would win the addition of a prescription drug benefit to
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans leaders in the House have already abandoned their
call for a single big tax-cutting package and replaced it with a
push for a series of smaller tax bills.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Clinton appears to be backing away from his
insistence that any tax cuts or other big new initiatives await
agreement on a plan to assure Social Security's long-term solvency,
something that neither party expects to attempt this year.

   NEW YORK _ The police roundups are never accompanied by a

charge usually asks two questions: ``Do you want to work at
McDonald's for the rest of your life? Do you want to super-size my
fries?''
</P>

   The suspects are junior high and high school students, and they
are playing hooky in the kind of place that has lured truants for

that this place is called Times Square.

   And if any doubt remains that it has become a mall, just ask the
nearest teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   Like Juan Morales, a clean-cut eighth-grader from Queens, who
skipped class with three friends last Tuesday and took the No. 7
train to Times Square ``because of, like, the new stuff _ MTV and
the Virgin Megastore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And,'' he quickly added, ``to check out girls, man.''
</P>
<P>
   He and his friends managed to check out only one girl before
they were rounded up by the Police Department's truancy patrol. ``I
guess we learned our lesson today,'' Juan said sarcastically upon
his release. Then he grinned, his braces glinting, and the four
headed back to Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there has probably never been a time _ from the era
of nickelodeons and burlesque right up through kung fu movies and
peep shows _ when the area was not a haunt for teen-agers gone
AWOL.
</P>
<P>
   But police officials say that now, the troubled truants looking
for pornography or fake ID cards or drugs have been replaced by
even more students of all kinds from around the metropolitan
region, who are cutting classes to seek out the relatively
wholesome alternatives offered by corporate America in the new
Times Square. They come for high-priced compact discs, high-priced
movies and the rare chance to stand on a crowded sidewalk for hours
for a fleeting glimpse of a rock band appearing at the MTV studios.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Helen Rossi, who has been patrolling Midtown for truants
since 1983, said that during most of her years on the job, the 42nd
Street area attracted primarily ``runaways, and kids who had
warrants, and juvenile delinquents.'' Searches of the truants often
turned up guns and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' she said, ``kids are coming to see 'N Sync.''
</P>
<P>
   Searches, when they are conducted, usually turn up cell phones
with Mom's number on the speed dial.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to tell exactly how many truants are showing up in
Times Square on an average school day, police officials say. Most
are coming from schools in the five boroughs, although officers
also commonly find students from Long Island, New Jersey and
Westchester.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the borough of Manhattan, the police find far fewer
truants every year _ between 5,000 and 6,000 _ than they did a
decade ago, when the number sometimes reached 10,000. The truancy
patrols do not appear to be any less aggressive or frequent than
they were during Times Square's more troubled past.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 100 or so teen-agers that the police now pick up every
week in Manhattan, about 60 are now found in the Times Square area,
and most of the rest in the Manhattan Mall on 34th Street, said
Chief Allan H. Hoehl, the police commander of Manhattan South.
</P>
<P>
   But on the busiest days in Times Square _ almost always when a
popular band shows up for an afternoon interview at MTV's
glass-walled studio on Broadway _ the official count does not help
a lot. Ms. Rossi's five officers try not to pluck students from
behind the barricades where they start to gather by the hundreds in
the early afternoon to stake out a prime spot to see their favorite
band.
</P>
<P>
   Officers also try not to pull students off long lines inside the
Virgin music store at Broadway and 45th Street when they throng
there to wait for a recording artist's autograph.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not looking to cause a riot,'' explains Ms. Rossi, who has
two daughters of her own, ages 11 and 15, and knows about these
things. Besides, she said, ``If you wanted to, you'd have to bring
buses to take everybody away.''
</P>
<P>
   And the officers can easily fill up their roving vans just by
concentrating on students who wander off from the crowds alone or
in small groups to the area's new high-tech arcades or to
McDonald's or to the Virgin store.
</P>
<P>
   This was the tactical mistake made by Rebecca Miller, 15, and
three of her friends from West Morris Mendham High School in New
Jersey, who skipped school late last fall to see Korn, a rap-metal
band that attracts almost fanatic crowds when it shows up for MTV's
interview program called ``Total Request Live.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time the students had cut school, and they did
so with the blessing of their parents, though not, of course, their
school. (``They can just deal,'' Rebecca said later about her
teachers.) An older sister of one student worked in Times Square,
so they caught a ride with her.
</P>
<P>
   Like many teen-agers interviewed in the area starting last fall,
she and her friends seemed curiously lacking in the seditious
spirit normally associated with truancy. Instead, they had asked
permission, planned in advance and gone with concrete goals: see
the band, buy compact discs, maybe get on television so that their
classmates will believe they were there.
</P>
<P>
   By 10 a.m., the students had already scouted out the best spot
near MTV. They walked around, staring up at all the jumbo
television screens and at the only parental presence anywhere
around: the huge, smiling faces of Charles Gibson and Diane Sawyer
on a ``Good Morning America'' billboard.
</P>
<P>
   But while thumbing through a CD rack at the Virgin store, they
were picked up by Ms. Rossi's uniformed police officers and held
(it is called ``noncriminal detention'') for two hours at the High
School of Graphic Arts on West 49th Street near 10th Avenue, a kind
of Central Booking for truants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was horrible,'' Rebecca said. ``We're coming here to see
our band, and, like, they pick us up and take us somewhere.'' But
she grinned as she said this and then showed off the word ``Korn''
written with a permanent marker on her stomach. Katie Largent, 14,
added that she wasn't sure where they had been taken, but it was in
``the middle of, like, nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Under normal procedure, noncriminal truants, are held one or two
hours while their parents and their schools are contacted. Then
they are generally released without charges and are told to go back
to school or home, or are held until parents arrive to pick them
up. They also get a police form that is universally referred to by
truants as a street pass, since it lets officers know that their
truancy has already been reported and they should not be detained
again.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Largent, Katie's mother, who arrived later in the afternoon
to pick up the four teen-agers, explained that she found it almost
comforting that they had been picked up, because it meant that the
police were actively watching out for young people in Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Largent, 49, a medical assistant for a pediatrician, said
she remembered playing hooky and going to Times Square herself when
she was in high school to see ``The Endless Summer,'' the surfing
documentary, ``of all things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If this place was like it was back then,'' she said, ``I
wouldn't have let them come anywhere near it.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind her on Broadway, her daughter began to scream and held up
a poster board sign toward the second-floor MTV studio windows,
hoping a producer might see. It said: ``We got arrested to see
Korn. Let us up. We earned it.''
</P>
<P>
   A few youth-oriented merchants in Times Square say the truant
crowd _ including many students not even in their teens _ has grown
so visible on some days that the merchants have begun to try to
keep them out during school hours.
</P>
<P>
   Guards who watch the doors of the Virgin Megastore, for example,
try to spot young-looking customers and turn them away before they
get inside. Russ Hamilton, the entertainment director for XS New
York, one of a handful of new video arcades in the area, says he
also tries to keep out truants, especially the chronic ones he sees
again and again.
</P>
<P>
   But he added that if students were determined to cut classes,
there were worse places for them to spend their time than the new
arcades, much safer and cleaner than their counterparts in the
1970s and 1980s, some of which were known for fake IDs or as places
where men met teen-age boys for sex.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton added that ultimately, it was not his arcade's
responsibility to control truancy. He did not add, of course, that
truancy probably lifted the arcade's bottom line. ``We can shake
our finger at them and try to discourage them,'' Hamilton
explained, ``but if they want to cut, there's not much you can do.
Kids are slick.''
</P>
<P>
   But in what could be an early measure of the effectiveness of
police and of the stores, there are already some chronic truants
reporting that Times Square is no longer a cool place to hang out
because they are too likely to get ``bagged'' or picked up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't go there anymore,'' said Erica Figueroa, 14, a
freshman from the High School for the Humanities on West 18th
Street, who was picked up by the police last week with a large
group of friends while riding the No. 1 train.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like MTV and all, but there are too many kids there, you
know? It makes me way too nervous.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Gasp. That's the first thing I did when I heard the AOL-Time
Warner news last Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The second thing I did was flash back to February 1995, when I
surfed the World Wide Web for the first time. I was working as the
nebulously titled ``director of content development'' for Delphi
Internet, a tiny online company that Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.
had just bought. Within a few months, the News Corp. entered into a
joint venture with MCI _ a union that, like the proposed
acquisition by America Online of Time Warner, was described by the
parties as the perfect strategic fit.
</P>
<P>
   Am I giving the story away if I say the marriage didn't work
out?
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, was long before dot-com fever swept large
pieces of the planet. Netscape had yet to go public, and Bill Gates
hadn't introduced his answer to Netscape's Navigator software _
Microsoft's Internet Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   In buying Delphi, the News Corp. had intended to make it a force
in the burgeoning online world. Who was better suited to such a
task than a media powerhouse like Murdoch, after all? The only
other major media company to have entered the fray at that point
was Time Warner, with its ill-fated Pathfinder, which was meant to
lasso all the company's brands into a set of linked Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   So the News Corp. had an early starter's advantage.
</P>
<P>
   And consider the competition at the time. There was Compuserve,
based out in the provinces _ Columbus, Ohio _ and owned by H&AMP;R
Block, a company whose main media presence was television
commercials at tax time.
</P>
<P>
   There was Prodigy, out of the media limelight in White Plains, a
suburb of New York City, and co-owned by Sears, Roebuck and by a
company we all knew was a computer dinosaur, IBM.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was a laughingly embarrassing company called
America Online, which acted as if the Internet was fast food and
could be packaged and peddled like a Big Mac and was based in
decidedly unchic Dulles, Va.
</P>
<P>
   None of those companies had our Sixth Avenue cachet. None could
match our easy access to world-class news and entertainment
resources _ our ``content.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the first time most of us had ever referred to an
editorial or artistic project with that base word: content. But
having content seemed to us the linchpin of a successful online
service. America Online had to pay providers for content
(including, at the time, The New York Times). Not our Rupert. He
owned the content outright.
</P>
<P>
   But getting Murdoch's vast resources _ TV Guide magazine, Fox
Television, the 20th Century-Fox studio, to name a few _ to move
online for the benefit of our service proved no simple matter. The
executives from the various News Corp. divisions who would even
talk to us wondered why they should give us their goods when
America Online was willing to pay for them. (These days, AOL gets
paid by partners to feature their content, but the scales balanced
differently back then.) Technical and legal issues also impeded our
discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Still, talk we all did, evangelizing the Net to anyone inside
and outside the Murdoch dynasty who would listen, who would
negotiate a deal. ``The Web isn't about computers,'' we would say.
``It's about connecting people, a new form of news and
entertainment.'' Did our voices betray our wishful thinking?
</P>
<P>
   Soon, my title became ``Web talent scout.'' Certainly, talented
people from all corners of the media world were recruited for the
venture, paid handsome amounts for taking the risks associated with
jumping into the unknown. They included a former executive producer
of ``The MacNeil/Lehrer News Hour,'' a former editor for a major
book publisher and a former promotions director of Rolling Stone.
</P>
<P>
   Few demanded stock options, if they even thought of them,
because no one expected an initial public offering. A smattering of
23-year-old computer programmers was thrown in for good measure,
but the programmers were yet to be the industry's dominant force.
</P>
<P>
   The staff quickly grew to more than 500 people _ so many that
human resources' orientation each Monday morning resembled a
parade. There were no degrees in Web design or e-commerce, a term
yet to be coined. Many people had barely used e-mail. What they
brought to the venture was an eagerness to build a new medium from
the bottom up.
</P>
<P>
   The eager, savvy administrator at our tiny branch office on the
Fox lot in Los Angeles, for instance, wrote up deals on napkins
with a producer or two to build some of the earliest Web sites for
movies, ``Die Hard 3'' and ``Power Rangers'' among them. With some
enlightened television personnel, we even concocted an online
auction of ``X-Files'' memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   As our permanent offices in the heart of the new district,
Silicon Alley, were constructed, money was spent in a less visible
but important way. A naming company was retained _ it was said for
$1 million _ to come up with a new identity and name for our grand
new service.
</P>
<P>
   Then, seemingly minutes after a new name, Genuine, was chosen in
spring 1995 came the blockbuster announcement: MCI, the mighty
information-network giant, had agreed to invest $1 billion in the
News Corp. Combining the News Corp.'s media content with MCI's
dial-up telephone network and Internet backbone created a sure-fire
formula for interactive-media success. Or so we hoped.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, though, there were problems. The new name
was tossed out, and deciding on an interim name became the first
struggle: should News Corp. precede MCI, or vice versa, before the
words ``joint venture''? A number of key executives were fired,
too, to make way for a new team.
</P>
<P>
   Each partner contributed a co-leader. The News Corp. sent its TV
Guide editor, Anthea Disney, to become editor of the online
venture. MCI sent a former Prodigy executive, Scott Kurnit, to be
the venture's chief executive. The team struggled to decide what
the service should include, how it would work and when it would go
into operation.
</P>
<P>
   MCI apparently lost faith in the relationship, and soon struck
an Internet backbone deal with Microsoft. Layoffs at our joint
venture followed. I got my walking papers in October 1995. By
February 1996, 300 employees had been cut. The online service that
never was fizzled before its debut _ though it briefly morphed into
a TV Guide-style Web site called I-Guide before shutting down
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   So when I heard the AOL-Time Warner news last week, I recalled
those Delphi days and remarked to myself how different the industry
landscape looked now, such a short time _ though eons in Internet
time _ later.
</P>
<P>
   And then, hearing AOL and Time Warner's grand plans, I wondered
whether things really had changed as much as those two companies
seemed to believe.

THE OVERWEIGHT NOW RIVAL THE HUNGRY IN NUMBER, STUDY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The number of overweight people in the world now rivals the
number of hungry, underfed people, a study of global trends
reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on research from a number of agencies and institutions,
Worldwatch Institute, an independent research organization in
Washington, said in its annual study ``State of the World 2000''
that 1.2 billion people, the largest number ever recorded, are
underfed and undernourished.
</P>
<P>
   But, the report adds, another 1.2 billion people are eating too
much or too much of the wrong food and have become ``probably the
fastest-growing group of the malnourished.''
</P>
<P>
   About 2 billion people in a third category that overlaps with
the first two are described as the ``hidden hungry''; they may
appear to be well fed but are weakened by a shortage of essential
vitamins and minerals. The report paints a world rife with eating
disorders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've created a way of life where our level of physical
activity has been so reduced that our caloric intake greatly
exceeds our caloric expenditure, and that surplus translates into
fat,'' said Lester R. Brown, president of Worldwatch, commenting on
the rise in obesity.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's sort of compelling about it is that in this country
last year, there were 400,000 liposuction procedures. It shows how
out of balance things are,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The report, published in New York by W.W. Norton, says that the
two extremes of hunger and obesity are increasingly found in all
societies, poor as well as rich, albeit in differing proportions.
</P>
<P>
   A 1999 U.N. study, one of those used for the Worldwatch report,
found that in China, the percentage of overweight people in the
population jumped to 15 percent from 9 percent in three years in
the early 1990s. In Brazil _ 31 percent _ and Colombia _ 43 percent
_ the percentage of overweight people is reaching a par with
several countries of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In some developing countries, gaps between the underfed and
overfed are growing. India, where obesity is common in pockets of
affluence, has the world's largest population of underweight,
malnourished children. The phenomenon has been studied by David
Barker, an epidemiologist at Southampton University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barker observes soberly,'' the Worldwatch study said, ``that
60 percent of all newborns in India would be in intensive care had
they been born in California.''
</P>
<P>
   The report notes that poverty, rather than food shortages, is
the main underlying cause of hunger. It states that 80 percent of
all malnourished children in the Third World in the last decade
lived in countries that reported food surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an age of unprecedented global prosperity, it is ironic _
and wholly unnecessary _ that malnutrition should exist on such a
massive scale,'' the report said. ``Indeed, poorly nourished people
are a sign of development gone awry: Prosperity has either bypassed
them and left them hungry, or saturated them to the point of
self-indulgence.''

WITH TWO BIG MEN, UCLA ABANDONS PRESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; CHAPEL HILL, N.C. _ UCLA coach Steve Lavin often talks about
learning from defeat, and he learned one of the harshest lessons of
his 3{-year career last week in the 12-point loss to USC: The
Bruins are a mess when they press.
</P>
<P>
   After USC shredded their full- and half-court pressure defenses
for 91 points and a slew of easy baskets, Lavin ordered a retreat
against North Carolina _ a compact 3-2 zone that protected the
paint and forced the Tar Heels to score from the perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I learned about this team is that we're not effective
when we extend our defense, because we open the flood gates and
start reaching and grabbing,'' Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   If Baron Davis (NBA) and JaRon Rush (suspended) were available,
it might be different. Their energy and athleticism _ and the depth
they'd provide _ are essential for a smothering press.
</P>
<P>
   But Lavin wants big men Jerome Moiso and Dan Gadzuric on the
floor together whenever possible. A press pushes one (and sometimes
both) away from the basket, while a zone uses their size and
wingspan and keeps them in the lane. It also protects against foul
trouble by limiting body-on-body situations. Moiso had two
Saturday, Gadzuric had one and UCLA committed just 17 _ its lowest
total in five games.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, tempo and pressure are intertwined. A zone slows the
game and reduces fast-break opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The press is always a dilemma, because we want to extend to
create tempo and stay out of those 52-50 grinders,'' Lavin said.
``Our offense is affected by our defense. But with two 7-footers,
they're better off in the paint. We'd rather get beat from the
3-point line than the interior. In all our big wins since I've been
here, that's been the formula.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Break out: Saturday marked the first time in 1{ seasons
together that Moiso and Gadzuric recorded double-doubles in the
same game. Gadzuric had 10 points and 10 rebounds. Moiso had 19
points and 11 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Gadzuric's performance was in line with recent play: He had 13
rebounds at Washington and 16 points at Washington State. But for
the struggling Moiso, Saturday was a breakthrough. It couldn't have
come at a better time with 22 NBA scouts and general managers in
attendance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope this will be a turning point,'' said Moiso, who is
expected to leave for the NBA this spring. ``Obviously, I've been
struggling a bit lately. I've been trying to be aggressive and I
haven't been able to find my game.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's leading scorer until Christmas, Moiso was ineffective
against Purdue, the Washington schools and USC, with 35 points in
the four games.
</P>
<P>
   __ Big shots: Junior guard Ryan Bailey wasn't the last player
UCLA wanted at the foul line with the game at stake, but he was
close.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey, a 62.5 percent foul shooter, had attempted just eight
free throws this season when he stepped to the line with a 69-68
lead and 14.9 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was praying, `Just let him make these free throws,' '' said
forward Rico Hines, a Greenville, N.C., native with 20 friends and
family members in the stands.
</P>
<P>
   No problem. Bailey banked in the first and clanked in the
second.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to laugh at the bank,'' Bailey said. ``I winked at the
bench to let them know everything was OK.''

JOHNSON RESIGNS FROM DOLPHINS AND WANNSTEDT SUCCEEDS HIM 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By CHARLES NOBLES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. _ Just a day after the Miami Dolphins endured a
humiliating 62-7 defeat in the National Football League playoffs,
Jimmy Johnson stepped down as the Miami head coach Sunday after
four seasons. His longtime assistant and friend, Dave Wannstedt,
was named his replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, a 56-year-old Texan who is best known for winning two
Super Bowls with the Dallas Cowboys, had indicated to team
officials in recent weeks that he had lost his passion for the game
and probably would call it a career once the season was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time it's final and forever,'' said Johnson, who had quit
for a day after last season.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson had a 171-102-2 overall record in nine NFL seasons. He
was 38-31 in his four seasons with Miami. Wannstedt, 47, was the
Dolphins assistant head coach this season after posting a 41-57
record in six seasons as the Chicago Bears head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson coached and oversaw the Dolphins football operations.
Like him, Wannstedt will also be the team's general manager, with
power over the draft and trades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Dave is a great football coach, and I think people are
going to find out how great a coach he is,'' Johnson said. ``When
you get right down to it, I think he is a better football coach
than what I am. He's got the passion for the game. He loves dealing
with the players. I really believe he's going to give them the
spark to make this organization better.''
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Jones, the Dolphins president, said Johnson first
indicated a desire to retire two weeks ago, when he told Jones and
team owner Wayne Huizenga, ``I don't think I can do this any
more.''
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Huizenga told Jones to assemble a list of
candidates to succeed Johnson. The list reached about 20 names,
Jones said, but Wannstedt was the only candidate to be interviewed,
and that did not take place until Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Huizenga, mindful that he was able to talk Johnson out of
retirement last year, met with his coach early Sunday, but it was a
brief conversation. ``It's final, Wayne,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   By 9 a.m., Johnson had an emotional meeting with his players,
telling them how close they were to being a genuine Super Bowl
contender and emphasizing the importance of securing a first-round
playoff bye.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could have heard a pin drop,'' cornerback Jerry Wilson
said. ``He was really talking from the heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Next Huizenga and Wannstedt met, with Jones, the team president,
present.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dave was so impressive with Wayne,'' Jones said. ``He didn't
say, `Well, maybe we might be able to do this or that.' He said,
`We can do this, this and this,' right now the line. Wayne's a very
decisive guy himself. At some point he stuck out his hand and said,
`We've got a deal.'''
</P>
<P>
   Both Huizenga and Jones cited the continuity that Wannstedt's
hiring provides. ``We're not stepping back and retooling,'' Jones
said. ``We're moving on.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson will no longer be a Dolphin employee, but he said he is
available to help in a variety of roles, including talent
evaluation. ``We'll be calling him,'' Wannstedt said with a laugh.
``We're not going to let him lay around down there in the Keys and
gain 20 pounds.''
</P>
<P>
   At several points during his midday news conference, Johnson's
voice quivered, particularly when he described his coaching career
as ``35 great years.'' But he left with his wife, Rhonda, without
giving reporters a chance to ask about his strained relationship
with quarterback Dan Marino.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson tried in vain to remold Marino into part of a less
turnover-prone offense, particularly this season. But he discovered
the perils of coaching a legend. Even after Marino suffered 17
interceptions this season and contributed to the Dolphins'
remarkable drubbing by the Jaguars, many fans continued to side
with Marino. Johnson faced an expletive-dotted barrage of insults
as he boarded the team bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take the handcuffs off Marino, you overrated bum,'' one man
yelled.
</P>
<P>
   As the team dispersed at the Fort Lauderdale Airport, Stuart
Weinstein, the team's security investigator, helped Johnson carry
luggage to his car. ``I've lost my passion to coach,'' Johnson
suddenly said. ``Tomorrow is my last day.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami clearly plans significant changes on offense. Three
offensive assistant coaches were released Sunday: Kippy Brown, the
offensive coordinator, Rich McGeorge, the line coach, and Larry
Seiple, the quarterbacks coach.
</P>
<P>
   Wannstedt said he would probably meet with Marino soon to
determine if he wants to keep playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure where his thoughts are,'' Wannstedt said. ``Dan
and I will talk about the whole scope of the offense, the team,
where we're going. And Dan will make that decision. We're not going
to pressure him into doing anything. He's meant too much to
Dolphins fans over the years all over the country to not respect
him with his decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Marino is scheduled to count almost $6 million against Miami's
salary cap next season. If he were to retire or be released, the
team's cap maneuverability would zoom to nearly $12 million, a
tantalizing prospect for the next free-agent auction.
</P>
<P>
   Huizenga said he would support Wannstedt in whatever he decides
to do regarding Marino. But then Huizenga hedged, saying Marino is
a special case and that he would like to be consulted on any
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Wannstedt, after immersing himself in all phases of the Dolphins
for a year, believes he has the organization around him that he
lacked in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just didn't have the support there,'' Jones said. ``He was
trying to do it all. Here, he doesn't have to. And in him, we think
we have a terrific person who knows a lot about coaching and a lot
about people, someone who can keep us moving down the right road.''

FORREST'S PROBLEM: HE'S TOO NICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You had a terrific amateur career, compiling a record of 225-16
and reaching the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   You're 30-0 with 25 knockouts in your seven-year professional
career.
</P>
<P>
   You're an in-your-prime 28.
</P>
<P>
   It all adds up to myriad world championships _ maybe a few by
this time _ right?
</P>
<P>
   Not if you're welterweight Vernon Forrest, who has yet to fight
for a major title.
</P>
<P>
   The 1992 Olympian has the credentials and the ability. He's
known inside the boxing world as a complete fighter _ good boxing
skills, good speed, good power. What he hasn't had is good
opponents. He will not have faced a big-name foe in his career
until he steps into the ring to face former junior welterweight
champion Vince Phillips on Saturday in Las Vegas in his first HBO
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   In good part, it comes down to this: He's !ital!too good _ not
to mention tall, 6 feet _ and relatively unknown, an unmarketable
combination. Too much risk for minimal financial gain.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Forrest is trying to lure Shane Mosley into the
ring for what would be a compelling matchup, but why should Mosley
comply? The Pomona fighter has a bead on Oscar De La Hoya and a
sizable payday. There's no reason to bother with Forrest.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Forrest's promotional firm, Main Events, has
been unable to push him to the top of the rankings _ which would
make him an unavoidable mandatory challenger for a title _ or get
him on HBO until now. Forrest's advisor, Charles Watson, blames the
corrupt sanctioning bodies more than Main Events.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, there's a sense of urgency,'' Forrest said from his
training camp in Houston. ``I thought by now I'd be a three-time
world champ. I'm definitely behind schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll catch up, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Forrest's troubles started even before he turned pro. He was the
defending amateur world champion in his weight class and a favorite
to win the gold medal when he went to Barcelona for the 1992
Olympic Games. However, he lost in the first round after suffering
food poisoning, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Forrest, so devastated ``I walked around Barcelona like a
zombie,'' lost his springboard to fame.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's his personality. Forrest is the last thing you want
to be in the boxing business: a nice guy.
</P>
<P>
   He's not a big talker. He only reluctantly has begun the
obligatory baiting of other fighters in order to get them into the
ring and sell himself to the public.
</P>
<P>
   And, although he grew up in a tough neighborhood in Augusta,
Ga., he's avoided trouble. His trainer, Ronnie Shields, said with
great emphasis that ``Vernon has never been in any trouble of any
kind.''
</P>
<P>
   And _ say it ain't so _ he works with !ital!kids, at-risk kids
in Augusta.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, he's too good for his own good. He'd probably be
further along in his boxing career had be become a bank robber
instead of a decent role model.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a Catch-22,'' he said. ``People want you to be a
good guy. Then, when you're a good guy, they say you need more
personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was watching the 50 Greatest Athletes on ESPN and I saw
(tennis player) Pete Sampras. They were saying how great he was but
that he didn't have a personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it shouldn't be about personality. It should be about
competing, doing the best you can do.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only one (Muhammad) Ali,'' he went on. ``We need to
leave that alone. That was 30 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Forrest might be wrong. It seems fighters need
something that sets them apart _ an Olympic gold medal, an electric
personality, a !ital!huge knockout punch, something.
</P>
<P>
   If he's as good as he appears to be, Forrest will simply have to
keep winning and bide his time. He's bound to get his chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is big,'' Watson said of the Phillips fight. ``After he
beats Phillips, people will see how good he is and great things
will come.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Mosley-Wise: Mosley will face 32-year-old veteran Willy Wise
in the main event Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   __ Vargas watch: Oxnard resident Fernando Vargas could face a
maximum sentence of nine years in state prison if convicted of
assault, a charge to which he pleaded innocent last week.
</P>
<P>
   However, largely because he has no record, experts say he
probably would be sentenced to three or four months in county jail
if convicted. That means his boxing career most likely will not be
jeopardized.
</P>
<P>
   The IBF junior middleweight champion is accused of beating Santa
Barbara residents Anthony Arria and Doug Rossi _ the former by
himself, the latter with four companions _ in a suburban Santa
Barbara home in July.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas' handlers have said that witnesses cannot place him in
the room at the time of the alleged beatings. However, Hilary
Dozer, senior deputy district attorney of Santa Barbara County,
said initial interviews suggest otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Statements made immediately after the event, including a 911
tape at the time Rossi was being beaten and the first interviews of
people who actually saw the event, indicate that five people
entered the room and beat Doug Rossi with golf clubs and sticks _
four guys and Vargas.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozer added that there is no evidence that Arria or Rossi are
responsible for bad bruises on Vargas' back, which the fighter had
photographed immediately after the incident.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is expected to take place in May, which means Vargas'
April 15 fight against Ike Quartey will not be jeopardized.
</P>
<P>
   __ Jones fight: It was the same old story for Roy Jones Jr.,
only with more glitz.
</P>
<P>
   Jones easily outpointed a pathetically overmatched David Telesco
to retain his light heavyweight titles at Radio City Music Hall in
New York on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' biggest challenge was staying in sync with the Rockettes
in their dance routine before the fight.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, this is boxing: A nice venue, a flashy pre-event show and
a lousy fight.
</P>
<P>
   Jones needs to find a worthy opponent.
</P>
<P>
   __ Movies: Boxing fans who like a good fight film, rejoice: Two
are showing at theaters at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hurricane,'' starring Denzel Washington, depicts the life
of fighter Rubin ``Hurricane'' Carter, who served 19 years in
prison on a murder conviction that was later overturned.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has received tremendous reviews for his performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Play it to the Bone,'' starring Antonio Banderas and Woody
Harrelson, is based on a fight in 1965 in which L.A.-based Mexicans
Polo Corona and Pulga Serrano received a call to fight in Las Vegas
that night, drove there together and engaged in an unforgettable
brawl.
</P>
<P>
   The entertaining film, directed by Ron Shelton (``Bull Durham,''
``White Men Can't Jump'') is raunchy but funny, and the main fight
scene is among the most realistic ever put on film.
</P>
<P>
   Corona, portrayed loosely by Banderas, attended the premiere of
the film last week. Serrano died 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   __ More Hurricane: Former middleweight champion Joey Giardello
is suing the film's makers because they made it seem as if his
unanimous-decision victory over Carter in 1964 was the result of
racial prejudice rather than what actually took place in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the movie belittled me,'' Giardello told the
Philadelphia Daily News. ``I fought so many fights (133) for so
many years (19), with all my heart, and this movie makes a mockery
of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Many critics have suggested the film strays from reality at
times.
</P>
<P>
   __ Hall of Fame: The International Boxing Hall of Fame is
inducting 12 people.
</P>
<P>
   They are: Ken Buchanan, lightweight; Jimmy Carter, lightweight;
Jeff Chandler, bantamweight; Carl ``Bobo'' Olson, middleweight;
Jimmy Barry, bantamweight; Battling Levinsky, light heavyweight;
Billy Petrolle, lightweight; Ad Wolgast, lightweight; Arthur
Chambers, lightweight; Jeff Dickson, promoter; Tito Lectoure,
promoter; Dan Morgan, manager.
</P>
<P>
   The best fighter of the bunch? Maybe Petrolle, who never won a
title. He beat greats Tony Canzoneri, Jimmy McLarnin and Jack
``Kid'' Berg.
</P>
<P>
   Barry, who fought before the turn of the century, never lost. He
was 59-0-9. &QL;

U.N. STRAINING TO APPOINT TOP INSPECTOR OF IRAQI ARMS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the deadline approached for appointing a new chief arms
inspector for Iraq, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan was still
unable Sunday to find a consensus on the Security Council for any
of his potential nominees.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Holbrooke, the American representative at the United
Nations and this month's council president, was left waiting until
the final hours for word from Annan before notifying other council
members. Diplomats said that the council was not likely to meet
until an agreement had been reached.
</P>
<P>
   Several diplomats expressed concern last week that a deadlock
extending beyond Sunday would create procedural and possibly legal
problems, while sending Iraq the wrong message.
</P>
<P>
   Annan had until midnight Sunday to appoint an executive chairman
for the newly created U.N. Monitoring, Verification and Inspection
Commission. He had hoped to name his choice by Friday, but the
decision had to be made in consultation with a divided Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
   The new commission would be a successor to the U.N. Special
Commission, which was forced to end its inspections after Iraq
refused to cooperate. The new entity was created by the council on
Dec. 17 after months of wrangling over how to establish a system
for judging when Iraq had met enough disarmament requirements to
warrant the lifting of the U.N. sanctions imposed in August 1990
after Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, China, France and Malaysia abstained during the Dec. 17
vote, signaling their displeasure with the new plan. Since then,
Russia and China, both with veto powers, have resisted the
nomination of a chief inspector who might be hard on Iraq _ in
effect, allowing the Iraqis to influence and stall the process.
</P>
<P>
   In the cease-fire resolution that ended the 1991 war in the
Persian Gulf, the sanctions were linked to the destruction of all
prohibited nuclear, biological, chemical and missile programs, and
Iraq is still at least technically required to comply with that
requirement.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats said that as the deadline approached Sunday, at least
two possible nominees had withdrawn from the running for the
position of chief inspector. They are Celso Amorim, a Brazilian
diplomat and former foreign minister who now works for the United
Nations in Geneva, and Abdul Minty, a South African nuclear expert
and Foreign Ministry official.
</P>
<P>
   While diplomats differed Sunday about who was still actively in
the running, Pasi Patokallio, a Finnish disarmament expert, and
Rolf Ekeus, the first executive chairman of the earlier commission,
were still thought to be in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has consistently said that it does not matter whom the
secretary-general chooses, because Iraq has no intention of
cooperating. The threat was repeated by Iraq's state-controlled
press Sunday.

GOP PLANS YEAR OF RAISING MONEY AND REACHING OUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Republican Party leaders did not talk much in
public about fund-raising at their winter meeting here this week,
but when they did discuss the party's finances, they seemed
supremely confident.
</P>
<P>
   Mel Sembler, the party's finance chairman, revealed that the
party has a budget of $177 million this year and has $10 million in
the bank. Sembler said he was sure that amount could be raised with
the help of the party's eventual nominee and a major fund-raising
program called Victory 2000, a committee that will accept soft
money, the unlimited campaign contributions from corporations and
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Jim Nicholson, the party's chairman, said the
$177-million goal was a record for the Republican National
Committee, and he added that raising that much money this year was
``not going to be easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately, several fund-raisers said they were sure the party
would far surpass that goal, especially if the nominee is Gov.
George W. Bush, who has refused to accept federal matching funds,
which come with spending limits, because his campaign has shattered
all previous presidential fund-raising records.
</P>
<P>
   Long discussions about money and budgets occurred in sessions
behind closed doors, several Republican leaders said.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee passed a resolution last
Friday that criticized the McCain-Feingold bill that calls for a
ban on soft money. The resolution deplored the Campaign Finance
Reform Act, saying it was ``a scheme that amounts to unilateral
disarmament by Republicans and their allies while leaving the
Democrats, unions and liberal special interests untouched.'' The
resolution said that the bill, which died last fall, ``might more
accurately be termed the Democrat Incumbent Protection Act of
1999.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Republican leaders, who concluded their four-day meeting
here Sunday, devoted most of their time showing how the money would
be spent: on several new strategies, such as efforts to woo
Hispanic voters and promote the use of the Internet to spread the
party's message.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have recognized over the last 120 days that it's a new
world, where you are digital or die,'' said Nicholson, who has
worked hard in the past few months on the party's Internet
initiatives. Several times this week, Nicholson said Republicans
must use the Internet to send the party's message directly to
supporters and would-be supporters without going ``through the
filter of the news media.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, the Republican Party became an Internet service
provider, offering the public access to the Internet through the
party's hookup. Besides the usual fare _ e-mail and chat rooms _
its service includes Web pages that provide frequent updates on the
latest Republican developments. The service also offers what party
officials call an ``antismut filter'' and ``unbiased reporting.''
An advertisement pitches the service to ``people who want freedom
FROM the press.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on their Web site, www.rnc.org, Republicans unveiled
GOPlanit, a calendar that allows users to follow the activities of
Republican candidates and organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Silicon Valley terms,'' Nicholson said, ``GOPlanit is a
killer application for the GOP at every level.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, America Online probably has nothing to fear. Nicholson
said in an interview that he hoped to enlist ``100,000 e-mail
activists'' by the start of the party's national convention in
Philadelphia in August. Nicholson said an e-mail activist is a
Republican who will forward the party's messages to at least 10
friends. ``With the press of one button, we would be able to reach
one million people,'' he said. ``It's phenomenal.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that they have built a new infrastructure to communicate
with voters, the Republicans heard warnings from some Internet
executives that the party must send messages that are positive,
rather than negative.
</P>
<P>
   At a panel discussion attended by about 100 Republicans, Jim
Barksdale, the former chief executive of Netscape, told Republican
leaders that to sway libertarian voters like themselves, the party
must ``lighten up'' on negative issues, such as opposition to
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Party is also using the Internet to spread its
message. The Democratic National Committee recently created a
``Bush Stump Speech Search Engine'' on its Web site,
www.democrats.org. By entering any statement uttered by Bush, users
are told how many times the Texas governor has used the statement
during earlier appearances. The intention is to portray him as
scripted and repetitious.
</P>
<P>
   In a new push to court Hispanic voters, Republicans introduced a
60-second television commercial this week that touched many
Republicans who watched its portrayal of a Hispanic family reunion
on the Fourth of July.
</P>
<P>
   But the bid stumbled out of the starting gate. Some party
officials winced at a report in The San Francisco Chronicle this
week. According to the report, a lecturer in a closed-door session
told Republicans that many Hispanics do not believe that the party
is in touch with their culture. So the lecturer urged them to find
ways that show their sensitivity to Hispanics, like a mention of
Ricky Martin and his hit song ``Livin' la Vida Loca,'' the
newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their reluctance to publicly embrace any candidate, most
Republican leaders interviewed here this week said they were
supporting Bush. They said he has the best chance to win. And they
said if he is the nominee, the party will have a much better chance
to maintain its slight edge over the Democrats in the House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Until the voters in Iowa, New Hampshire and other states select
a nominee, of course, the Republican National Committee must remain
neutral.

17 YEARS LATER, HOW THEIR FIFTH-GRADE PREDICTIONS TURNED OUT

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HIGHLAND PARK, Ill. _ Seventeen years ago, Carl Berg asked the
27 students in his fifth-grade class, ages 10 and 11, to write
essays imagining their lives and jobs, and those of their
classmates, in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   They also made a promise: that when Berg called at the turn of
the century to take attendance, they would make every effort to
avoid being marked absent by their teacher, who would be 48.
</P>
<P>
   Now ages 27 and 28, all but five of those graduates of Sherwood
Elementary kept their word this weekend, reuniting in this suburb
of Chicago to read their essays and determine whether anyone's
predictions had come true.
</P>
<P>
   Though some of the essays were remarkably prophetic, none of the
students anticipated the influence that Berg, who still arrives in
his classroom at 6 a.m. most days, would have on so many of their
careers.
</P>
<P>
   Eight of the 27 _ all of them women _ have taught or are
teaching in elementary or secondary schools. By comparison, the
proportion of teachers in the general population is fewer than two
out of 50 _ and each of the eight said that emulating Berg had
weighed heavily on her decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's definitely an inspiration,'' said Suzanne Wollack, 27,
who quit an advertising job in Chicago last year to begin studying
for a master's degree in education at National-Louis University in
nearby Evanston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something I had always wanted to do,'' said Ms. Wollack,
who was Berg's teaching assistant last fall. ``I had just become
sidetracked.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there were plenty of nonteachers present when the
students convened for two separate reunions _ in Berg's class on
Friday, when the alumni helped the current fifth graders write
essays looking ahead to the year 2020, and on Saturday night, at a
smoky bar called Rainbow's where Berg said he and his colleagues
had written some of their best lesson plans.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on a bar stool, Carl Schwarz, 27, told the group that he
owned a construction company bearing his name and had become an
architect, just as Joanna Arlow had written that he would. (Ms.
Arlow, now a law student, said she could not recall what had
motivated that prophecy.)
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Benjamin, who couldn't make it because of a commitment to
teach snowboarding in Colorado, sent word through Berg that he had
become a speed skater _ one of Ms. Wollack's predictions _ and had
narrowly missed making the U.S. Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   And Lisa Pinsky, 27, disclosed that Jenna Messer had been
correct when she anticipated that Ms. Pinsky would marry someone
named John. Ms. Messer, now 27 and a fifth-grade teacher, had
missed only on the last name (and the spelling of the first):
instead of John Travolta, Ms. Pinsky married an accountant named
Jon Ezrol. Ms. Pinksy had predicted that she would arrive at the
reunion in a chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce. Instead, she came in a
black Ford Taurus driven by her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, sometimes the predictions that didn't come true were
more telling than those that did, particularly for what they showed
about the perspective of a 10-year-old in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, Linda Vogel imagined that when Berg's call came, she
would be doing ``nothing but wait for my husband to come home.'' In
fact, she is an interior designer of restaurants and office
buildings in Austin, Texas, who has yet to marry.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Chase made no mention of a potential job in her essay,
other than being the mother of seven. She said on Saturday that she
was running a bit behind _ she is due to be married in July _
because of her teaching career. Having done her student teaching
three years ago at Sherwood, Ms. Chase, 27, now teaches third-,
fourth- and fifth-graders with behavior disorders in nearby
Waukegan.
</P>
<P>
   Someone had predicted that Jennifer Spiegler would be a
waitress, but she became a marketing manager in the promotions
department at The New York Times. And in a sign of what a
10-year-old imagines 48 looking like, most of the students had
predicted that Berg would arrive with a cane, false teeth and white
hair. In fact, he is an athletic 6 feet tall, with all his teeth in
place and his thick hair mostly black, with flecks of gray.
</P>
<P>
   As they walked around Berg's class, his former students
discovered that little had changed, other than his room having
moved from No. 18 to No. 25. The ``box houses'' are still there _
six giant cardboard clubhouses in which the students array their
desks, and which ring a common meeting area.
</P>
<P>
   But the wall decorations are different. Where the favorite
pinups of the Class of 1983 were of Brooke Shields and Scott Baio
(remember Chachi from ``Happy Days''?), this year's class pines for
the actress Jennifer Love Hewitt and the singer Ricky Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Berg said he had conceived his 1983 essay question on a whim,
and had never repeated the assignment until Friday.
</P>
<P>
   That day, Alexandria Havlick, 10, wrote that in 2020, at age 30,
she would be an environmental lawyer. Ilana Goldberg, 10, who has
already sung a child's part in ``Carmen'' at the Chicago Lyric
Opera, said she would be an opera singer. And Ryann Streicker, 11,
said that Berg's call would come after ``I came home from a long
day in the operating room after I performed a triple bypass.''
</P>
<P>
   No one predicted becoming a teacher. But there is, of course,
still time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait for my reunion,'' said Max Salberg, 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll still be here,'' Berg told him.

 &HT;    Bush sends mixed signals on gay, lesbian policy
 &HT;    By Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Republican presidential front-runner George W.
Bush has vowed to bring minority groups into the GOP fold. But
members of one minority group _ gays and lesbians _ still aren't
sure whether Bush's emphasis on inclusiveness includes them.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent debate, Bush said he would appoint people based
on their qualifications, not their sexual orientation. But he has
refused to meet with the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay GOP group.
Gay-rights advocates hold positions in the Bush campaign. But the
governor promised a group of Christian conservatives that as
president he wouldn't appoint people who espouse a homosexual
lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's mixed signals reflect the complexities of cultivating a
relationship with the gay community. If he embraces it, Bush could
lose Christian conservative votes in the GOP primaries or, in the
general election, against a socially conservative third-party
candidate such as Pat Buchanan. But exit polls suggest that gay
voters make up about 5 percent of the electorate _ about the same
as Hispanics _ and they are concentrated in electoral-vote-rich
states such as California, New York, Illinois and Florida.
Conceding so many votes to the Democrats could be politically
perilous.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots of gay people who by tradition and heritage
would be much more at home in the Republican Party, were it not for
things like George Bush being embarrassed to be seen with
homosexuals,'' said Kenneth Sherrill, a political science professor
at Hunter College in New York City who studies gay rights issues.
</P>
<P>
   As the country becomes increasingly tolerant of homosexuality,
Bush's lukewarm attitude may alienate heterosexual voters as well,
Sherrill said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This strikes me as a classic example of what happens when a
candidate adopts a strategy that's designed to win the nomination,
even at the cost of losing the election,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Vice President Al Gore and former New Jersey Sen.
Bill Bradley haven't been bashful about courting the gay vote,
which could be especially critical in their fight for the
Democratic nomination. People who identify themselves as gay make
up between 8 percent and 9 percent of the Democratic electorate
nationwide, and slightly more in the crucial primary states of New
York and California.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent debate, both Democrats argued that the current
``don't ask, don't tell'' policy on gays in the military isn't
working and that gays should be allowed to serve openly. Gore and
Bradley are cognizant of polls that show 70 percent of Americans
support that view, although 76 percent of senior military officers
oppose it. Furthermore, in the wake of several high-profile murders
of gays, people are increasingly sensitive to the dangers of
discrimination. Even the Rev. Jerry Falwell, the Virginia preacher
who founded the Moral Majority, has called for an end to anti-gay
rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent GOP debate, several Republican candidates said
gays should be banned from the military and characterized them as
immoral. But Bush and his closest rival, Sen. John McCain of
Arizona, declined to criticize homosexuality and said they support
the current policy.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Bush, however, McCain met with the Log Cabin Republicans.
Asked during a television interview to explain his refusal to meet
with the group, Bush said he didn't believe in ``group thought'' or
``pitting one group of people against another.'' Many were puzzled
by that explanation, given that Bush frequently meets with other
political and interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Scott McClellan shed little light on that
response, saying Bush refused to meet with the Log Cabin
Republicans because they politicize gay issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does not believe in politicizing the issue, and this is a
group that wants to politicize it,'' McClellan said. He added that
Bush didn't see the point of meeting with the group because he
disagrees with its positions.
</P>
<P>
   Nor would the Bush campaign say whether the governor agrees with
the Texas GOP's platform position on gays and lesbians, which is
that ``homosexual behavior is contrary to the fundamental,
unchanging truths that have been ordained by God.'' Instead,
campaign spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said that Bush believes that
``it's not his place to judge other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's Texas legislative record also is open to interpretation.
Rep. Glen Maxey, the only openly gay member of the Texas
Legislature, describes Bush as ``pretty benign'' because whatever
his policy positions, he hasn't resorted to anti-gay rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not a Jesse Helms,'' Maxey (D-Austin) said in a reference
to the conservative North Carolina senator. ``But at a time when
there's a tremendous rise in hate crimes, and discrimination in the
workplace still abounds, the fact that a leader would not see gay
and lesbian issues as important or take a position one way or the
other is troubling to me.''
</P>
<P>
   When state lawmakers last year proposed a bill barring gays and
lesbians from adopting children in state custody, Bush said he
believed that children were better off in homes with traditional
couples. But the state already favors such arrangements, and Bush
wouldn't say whether he supported the bill, which would have
removed children from gay and lesbian homes. The legislation never
reached his desk.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also declined to take a firm position last year on a
hate-crimes bill that would have listed homosexuals as a protected
group. He argued that all violent crimes are hate crimes and noted
that Texas already has a hate-crimes law, albeit one that doesn't
specify who is protected.
</P>
<P>
   Bush promised to consider the latest version if lawmakers
approved it, but he declined to help break the legislative deadlock
that eventually killed the proposal. Gay rights groups suspected
that the bill's protection of gays was behind his failure to
support the bill, but Bush denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
   Like presidential candidates from both parties, Bush opposes
same-sex marriages. The Democrats want to guarantee legal and
financial benefits to gay and lesbian partnerships, but they
maintain that marriage is a religious and cultural institution
reserved for a man and a woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush has had a fair record, and many gays believe he's been a
good governor. But he does need to move more on some gay political
issues,'' said Steve Labinski, who heads the Texas branch of the
Log Cabin Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Gay Texas Republicans note that during the party's 1998
convention, Bush urged the GOP to allow the state's Log Cabin
Republicans, who had been banned from setting up a booth, to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Maxey suspects that some of Bush's positions are the result of
political considerations rather than his personal views. He points
to a conversation he had with Bush last spring on the floor of the
Texas House. Maxey said the governor told him his stance on the gay
adoption bill had nothing to do with his view of Maxey, whom he
``valued as a person.'' Based on that talk, Maxey believes that
Bush is a lot more tolerant of gays than his record might indicate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, however, said later that the two discussed children's
health insurance, not homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Madison Project, a conservative political action
committee, came away from a September meeting with Bush with a
different impression than Maxey. Michael Farris, the chairman of
the group, said he asked Bush about his comment that he wouldn't
fire an aide he discovered to be gay. Farris was reassured by
Bush's response.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said I'm not going to appoint people who are open advocates
of the homosexual lifestyle because their policies aren't likely to
be my policies on issues,'' Farris said. Openly gay people serve on
some of Bush's state steering committees, but Farris said he is not
bothered by that because the panels are mostly honorary.
Furthermore, Farris believes that Bush has genuinely conservative
views ``in his heart'' about homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Gay Republicans hope Farris is wrong and that Bush is simply
doing what he must to win the GOP primaries. They say he may be
more receptive to gays once he's the nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Ivers, a spokesman for the national Log Cabin Republicans,
said Bush should be well aware of the importance of creating a
tolerant image for the GOP in the general election. Ivers argues
that Buchanan's anti-gay remarks at the 1992 Republican convention
tarnished the party, helping to seal the failure of President
George Bush's re-election bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``How the Republican Party deals with gays and lesbians is an
indication of how it's going to deal with this persistent problem
they have of being labeled as intolerant,'' Ivers said. ``The gay
issue is the most hot-button issue of all the minority issues in
this election.''

COMMENTARY: THERE'S A WAR ON 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Acting President Vladimir Putin's campaign to wipe
out all Chechen resistance to Moscow's authority is no longer a
triumphal parade. Russian casualties have begun to mount.
</P>
<P>
   This is not good for a political campaign whose candidate's
sudden popularity depends solely on a cost-free victory over the
despised Chechens. The election was moved closer in a Yeltsin-Putin
deal so it could be conducted during the war fever, but body bags
dampen jingoistic spirits.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, the leaders of Chechya's independence movement
are bracing themselves for a morale-boosting stunt by the former
KGB man at the head of Russia's government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin will have to boost the anti-Chechen feeling,'' says
Ilyas Akhmadov, the 39-year old former philosophy student that the
Chechen separatists have named their foreign minister. ``They may
stage another apartment-house bombing.'' Akhmadov was in Washington
last week to meet the lowest-level employee our State Dept could
find, at a location not too close to Foggy Bottom. Even so,
Russia's foreign minister denounced the United States for paying
any attention at all to him.
</P>
<P>
   Bombings that killed 300 civilians _ whether by Chechen
terrorists, as Moscow claims, or by KGB provocateurs, as many
Chechens believe _ frightened and infuriated the Russian public.
Whoever was behind the bombings, the one who benefited most from
the terror was Putin.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will note that none of the elite died in the apartment
houses,'' says Akhmadov. ``Only poor people. We have no proof that
the FSB (new name for the KGB) did this, but they have no proof
that we did. And consider what happened at Ryazan.''
</P>
<P>
   Just before Christmas at that town not far from Moscow, internal
security forces rounded up Caucasian ``terrorists'' and displayed a
trove of explosives. But Russian police, say the Chechens,
inconveniently found that the planters of explosives were KGB men;
a cover story was put out that it was all an FSB ``training
exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian generals keep announcing the imminent fall of Grozny,
which they keep pounding with artillery. But several generals have
been hastily replaced after their predictions fell flat. ``In close
combat, we do better,'' says the Chechen. ``If we lose Grozny,
we'll fight elsewhere, and then we'll take back Grozny.''
</P>
<P>
   Who is supplying the resistance? ``We cannot do without the
Russian army for our supplies,'' says Akhmadov. ``After a few weeks
in the field, they will sell us any weapon. That's why they keep
rotating their soldiers back after a short time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chechens' most useful weapon? ``The RPG-7 grenade launcher.
We call it `the Chechen nuclear bomb.' The price is supposed to be
$800, but our men get it from the Russian soldiers for 20 bottles
of vodka.''
</P>
<P>
   The youthful spokesman makes a good impression, but there's no
denying that Chechnya, after humiliating Russia's army a few years
ago, became a lawless land. Kidnappers, mafiosi, and nogoodniks _
called by Akhmadov ``irresponsible elements manipulated by the
FSB'' _ abound. Chechen self-rule is not an easy cause for
outsiders to embrace.
</P>
<P>
   But that offers no excuse for the Russian generals and their
Kremlin political allies to try to pulverize a whole people. The
war going on now is Stalinesque: ``We are fighting to save
ourselves from extermination because a military coup is taking
place in Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. Whatever the motive for the bombardment-massacre, the
civilized world cannot allow the all-out war on the Chechen people
to continue without consequences. For Russia's unelected new leader
to order the breakup of families trying to escape the bombs _
detaining all males from 10 to 60 _ is barbaric; for us to shrug it
off would be heartless and feckless.
</P>
<P>
   We cannot intervene because _ as we were warned again last week
_ Russia is a nuclear power. As embattled Chechens begin to bleed
the invaders in guerrilla war, we can help _ not with guns or
money, but with heavier media attention and unrelenting diplomatic
pressure. And by not jumping to conclusions about the identity of
terror bombers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do you honor them as part of a Group of Eight?'' asks the
Chechen spokesman. And why do we let the World Bank shower money on
Russian enterprises? Some people in Washington just do not realize
that there is a shooting war on.

<P>
   ARGUN, Russia _ Russian troops scattered to look for rebel
snipers as Nikolai P. Koshman climbed out of his helicopter to
inspect this battered Chechen city.
</P>
<P>
   It was not long before he was bombarded with complaints. An
agitated man said Russian artillery strikes had destroyed his home.
An elderly woman whimpered that it was very hard for families to
endure the war, and children had nothing to eat.
</P>
<P>
   Koshman promised to look into their problems, and offered a few
encouraging words: ``We have to finish our work, and then
everything will be normal. We have to establish order together.''
</P>
<P>
   It was just another day for Koshman, a Russian deputy prime
minister and the man the Kremlin has charged with re-establishing
normal life in the Russian-controlled regions of the breakaway
southern republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   It is more than a humanitarian mission. Koshman's task is not
just to restore gas and electricity, reopen the schools and
hospitals and generate jobs in a region that has been tormented by
war and disorder for the better part of a decade.
</P>
<P>
   It is also to secure the loyalty of a wary population, depriving
the separatist militants of the popular support they need to wage a
long guerrilla war. The job would be hard enough in peacetime, and
rebel raids behind Russian lines have severely complicated that
task.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Ukraine, the 55-year-old Koshman has often had tough
assignments. He served in the railroad troops, the part of the
Soviet military assigned to guard and build rail lines. He was
involved in the cleanup of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, and came
to Chechnya in 1994 to help restore tracks damaged in the earlier
war with separatists in this republic, which ended with a
humiliating Russian defeat and the de facto independence of
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing his trademark cap and leather jacket, Koshman
hop-scotches his way around Chechnya by helicopter and military
jeep. Equipped with machine guns, grenade launchers and sniper
rifles, hand grenades, pistols and flares, burly soldiers jump out
with their weapons every time Koshman's motorcade stops, preparing
for a possible ambush.
</P>
<P>
   Koshman, however, does not appear to be worried about security.
He mingles with townspeople, jotting down their pleas and
complaints in a notebook.
</P>
<P>
   There are many appeals. During a visit to Tolstoy-Yurt, a poor
settlement north of Grozny, Chechen students asked his help in
transferring to Russian universities because none are functioning
in Chechnya. In Gudermes, a doctor told him Russian soldiers had
stolen a hospital's trailer and asked him to help get it back.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the easy issues, and Koshman's job has become more
difficult as Russian troops have occupied more and more of
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Koshman focused on northern Chechnya, which is
generally sympathetic to the Russian presence. It has become
something of a showcase for Russia's efforts to restore basic
services. To secure the loyalty of a largely obedient population,
the Russian government has started paying wages, pensions and
subsidies for families with children _ payments that residents say
were not made under the administration of the Chechen leader, Aslan
Maskhadov.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Russian troops have moved into the Chechen lowlands,
however, Koshman is contending with people who are less friendly to
Russian troops and an area where rebel raids remain a worry.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   His problems will multiply exponentially if Russian troops take
Grozny, the capital. In a December interview, Koshman suggested
that Russian forces might be better off if they simply surrounded
Grozny, gradually helped the civilian population leave and let the
rebels sit in the ruined city. The Kremlin is intent, however, on
taking Grozny, and Koshman is loyally drawing up plans to restore
the city.
</P>
<P>
   He estimated that it would cost 10 to 12 billion rubles _ $350
million to $420 million _ to rebuild the Chechen lowlands south of
Grozny, a sizable sum for a cash-strapped Russia. ``For Grozny
alone, multiply that by three or four,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Chechnya's problems are legion. Most of the oil wells
have stopped working and 12 oil wells have caught fire, burning
2,500 tons of oil a day. Six thousand people used to work in
Chechnya's oil industry, but that work force has shrunk to 500.
Restoring petroleum production is vital for Koshman's plan to
generate jobs and bring in badly needed revenue for Chechnya's
development.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture is in a state of crisis. Most of Chechnya's cattle,
sheep and poultry have perished. Out of 900,000 acres of farmland,
only 67,000 have been ploughed and 21,000 sown with winter wheat.
</P>
<P>
   With tuberculosis and other diseases stalking Chechnya, medical
care is a major worry. There were about 11,000 hospital beds in
Chechnya in the early 1990s. Today, there are only 2,200.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials are proud of the progress they have made in
restoring electricity, but there is plenty more to do. About 500
miles of electrical cable has been fixed, but much more needs
repair.
</P>
<P>
   Koshman said Chechnya's residents would be able to vote in
Russia's presidential elections in March. Elections to pick a new
Chechen leadership, however, will not be held until the end of this
year or the beginning of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Still, Koshman insists that he is confident he can carry out his
task. He is even planning to move his headquarters in a few days
from the Russian military base at Mozdok, northwest of Chechnya, to
Gudermes, Chechnya's second-largest city. The move, Koshman says,
will place him and his staff closer to the Chechen settlements they
are trying to help. It also appears to be a symbolic effort to
demonstrate that Russia is establishing control over Chechnya
despite recent rebel attacks.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning of February, we will be in Grozny, maybe even
earlier,'' he said in an interview on Saturday night, pointing, on
a map, to the airport on the northern outskirts of the city.

   In Argun, a city six miles east of Grozny, it was clear that
Koshman had plenty of work ahead of him. Hundreds of rebels fought
their way into the city last week and killed the Russian military
commandant there before retreating.
</P>
<P>
   Aza Khadzimuradova, 33, said Argun's residents have no gas, no
electricity, no working schools, no pensions and a hospital that
has only recently started to operate.
</P>
<P>
   With his customary optimism, Koshman was undaunted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Achkhoy-Martan, Shali, Argun and other settlements in the
lowlands are like the north was at the end of October,'' Koshman
said. ``Come back in February. The schools and hospitals will be
working and you will see serious changes.''

COMMENTARY: WHEN HATE SEES AN OPENING 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Iowa, Ohio, Calif., Ore., Ala.)  (jw) 
 By BOB HERBERT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   You can get a chill just turning the pages of ``Youth at the
Edge,'' a report from the Southern Poverty Law Center on the
inroads that organized hate groups are making among angry white
youths in communities that are struggling despite the economic boom
of the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the development of a two-tiered economy, we're seeing the
rise of a new underclass of white youth that is particularly
susceptible to the lure of hate groups,'' said Mark Potok, a
spokesman for the law center, which monitors hate groups around the
country and is headquartered in Montgomery, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Racist gangs, hard-core neo-Nazi groups and major white
supremacist outfits like the Hammerskin Nation are having a field
day recruiting youngsters, often from suburbia, whose families are
beleaguered financially and losing faith in their dream of a stable
middle-class existence.
</P>
<P>
   These kids hear the seductive tones of organized haters telling
them they're special, they're white, and yet they're getting the
short end of everything. It's the fault of the blacks, they're
told, and the Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Most kids resist. The winds of racism in the United States blow
with a lot less force than they did four or five decades ago. But a
frightening number respond. And some are very young. In a
commentary that accompanied the center's report, Potok wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``In Cedar Rapids, Iowa, a 12-year-old boy distributes
propaganda for neo-Nazi leader Matt Hale, a man whose one-time
deputy murdered two people and wounded seven others last July. In
Cleveland, a group of white 14- and 15-year-olds allegedly plans an
October massacre of black students on homecoming day. And in
Pasadena, Calif., four 13- and 14-year-olds, one of them fond of
swastikas and similar symbols, are accused of drawing up plans in
September to murder Armenians _ an ethnic group that the children's
leader had apparently decided was not truly white after reviewing
stacks of hate literature.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the cases mentioned in the report was that of Milton
Walker, a homeless black man who was murdered a little over four
years ago by a group of young whites in Lancaster, Calif., a suburb
of Los Angeles. The report described the crime as ``a particularly
grotesque killing that allegedly was followed by a 16-year-old
girl's boast of having `played' with the man's eyeballs.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the men accused of attacking Walker, a 23-year-old named
Randall Rojas, said he had come from a troubled family and found a
home with an offshoot of the Nazi Low Riders, an increasingly
influential gang devoted to drug dealing and white supremacy.
</P>
<P>
   The law center is not suggesting that tough times automatically
lead to ethnic hatred. ``You don't become a klansman just because
you lost your job,'' said Potok.
</P>
<P>
   But there is little doubt that large numbers of alienated young
people, struggling against economic and other forces that often are
difficult to see and even harder to fight, are primed for the
offering of scapegoats.
</P>
<P>
   In communities that appear to be benefiting little from the
miracles of technology and globalization, it's not as difficult as
one might imagine to advance the idea that golden opportunities for
whites have been destroyed by blacks riding the wave of affirmative
action and Jews who are secretly running things through their
control of the federal apparatus, otherwise known as the Zionist
Occupational Government.
</P>
<P>
   This sickness is more widespread than we wish to believe and
frequently results in insane violence. If you want a quick way to
grasp the potential for mayhem, think Skinheads.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Blazak, a sociologist at Portland State University in
Oregon who has spent years studying white supremacist Skinheads,
was interviewed as part of the law center's study.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most hard-core kids had experienced some first- or
second-hand downward mobility,'' he said. ``But the propaganda
around the changing face of the American Dream was just as
powerful. The perception was that all white people are moving down,
and all minority people are moving up: `The working-class white man
is losing out on America, the country that he built.' '' &QL;

 &HT;    Boycott of Georgia tourism possible as S.C. flag fight spreads
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ The fight over the Confederate flag engulfing
South Carolina is spilling into Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   As an estimated 20,000 flag opponents gather in Columbia today
for a Martin Luther King Jr. Day rally, the Rev. Jesse Jackson is
urging a tourism boycott of Georgia until the state legislature
removes the Confederate emblem from the state flag. The NAACP
started a similar boycott against South Carolina on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will use whatever technique is necessary to focus attention
on the flag in Georgia,'' said Joe Beasley, the Southern regional
director for Jackson's civil rights organization, the Rainbow/PUSH
Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Beasley said civil rights groups, hoping to capitalize on
national publicity for the Super Bowl, plan to call for the Georgia
boycott Jan. 30 during the 34th annual Super Bowl in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Georgia Dome hosted the Super Bowl, in 1994,
civil rights groups staged a protest against the Confederate
emblem, incorporated in Georgia's flag in 1956 by legislators
honoring the state's Civil War dead. But the upcoming Super Bowl
demonstration will be the first time flag opponents, who view the
emblem as a racist symbol, will seek economic sanctions against
Georgia, Beasley said.
</P>
<P>
   Beasley said the boycott in South Carolina, the last state to
fly the Confederate flag atop its Statehouse, inspired Georgia
civil rights officials, who have failed in recent years to persuade
the Legislature to change the state flag.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would say to people who love justice and equity that
Georgia and Atlanta are living in the past,'' Beasley said. ''They
should not attend any conventions in Atlanta or Georgia until that
flag is removed.''
</P>
<P>
   Tourism is Georgia's second-largest industry behind
manufacturing, providing $18 billion in business to hotels and
resorts, restaurants and other businesses, according to the state
Department of Industry, Trade and Tourism. Atlanta claims an
estimated 60 percent of that revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any time you have people in the state who feel there is an
issue degrading to them, embarrassing to them, we are concerned
about it,'' said Bill Howard, spokesman for the Atlanta Convention
and Visitors Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   But Howard questioned whether economic sanctions would gain much
support, especially in Atlanta where black residents are prominent
in business, politics and civic affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Atlanta is a city in which blacks have a huge stake. Why
boycott a black mecca?'' Howard said. ''It seems
counter-productive.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of Georgia's Sons of Confederate Veterans predicted a
boycott would fail because the emblem has widespread support,
especially outside of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ''The city of Atlanta does not run the state of Georgia,'' said
Elijah Coleman, a Sons of Confederate Veterans member from
Mableton. ''Legislators from outside of Atlanta are with us on
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Beasley said he plans to seek support for the boycott from the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the
Southern Christian Leadership Conference, longtime allies of the
Rainbow/PUSH Coalition. Officials of those organizations in Atlanta
couldn't be reached Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Beasley said the boycott will appeal directly to black National
Football League players, urging them to protest the return of the
Super Bowl to Atlanta until the flag is changed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would hope that they would speak out,'' Beasley said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, civil rights groups have grown more vocal in
condemning the Confederate flag as a remnant of slavery intended to
defy civil rights progress over the past half century. Critics say
it is inappropriate as part of any state flag.
</P>
<P>
   But defenders of the flag have begun to rally, sparking a march
of 6,000 people in Columbia nine days ago. Today's King Day rally
by flag opponents also will converge on the Statehouse, where South
Carolina Gov. Jim Hodges is prodding legislators to resolve the
flag fight, so far with little success.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators plan further meetings this week on a flag
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the state's Legislative Black Caucus joined the NAACP
in saying relocating the Confederate flag from atop the state
Capitol to the nearby Confederate soldiers' monument would not be
sufficient. But some of the most vocal pro-flag legislators say
they will not consider moving the flag until economic sanctions
against South Carolina end _ a step the NAACP says it is unwilling
to take.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina's fight is also spilling over into the
presidential debate. On Saturday, Vice President Al Gore accused
Republican front-runner George W. Bush of ducking the issue
recently when he told South Carolinians the flag's fate was their
decision.
</P>
<P>
   In a TV interview with Jackson, Gore said the flag represents
''for many Americans a hurtful message that recalls the pain of
slavery.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush did agree with Republican opponent Alan Keyes that S.C.
Sen. Arthur Ravenel's reference to the NAACP as the ''National
Association for Retarded People'' was inappropriate and should be
repudiated.
</P>
<P>
   Ravenel, a Republican from Mount Pleasant, has scheduled a news
conference in Columbia on Tuesday, he said, to ''conclude, as far
as I am concerned, this little controversy.''

U.S. STUDIES UNKNOWN RUSSIAN RESUME 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In contrast to his predecessors as leader of
Russia, Vladimir Putin appears to be a modern decision-maker who
knows how to make things happen, Clinton administration officials
say. What remains unclear is whether his political instincts match
that style of action.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can get the trains running on time, but the question is
where the trains are going,'' said one senior policy-maker. ``We
may be looking at a modern decision-maker but the question is
whether he has progressive values.''
</P>
<P>
   As the administration pieces together its assessment of Putin,
who replaced Boris Yeltsin a little more than two weeks ago,
Washington is battling two factors. First, the United States knows
much less about Putin than it did about Soviet leaders during the
Cold War. Second, the Clinton administration must deal with him
during volatile political seasons in both Russia and the United
States, with a war in Chechnya souring relations between them.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, who became prime minister of Russia only last August, has
suddenly come to power from relative obscurity at the early age of
47. His resume's bare bones _ including his service in the KGB's
foreign intelligence arm and his role as director of its successor,
the Federal Security Service _ are known.
</P>
<P>
   But the meaning of Putin's resume, and where his instincts
really lie, are not understood, officials said. Did Putin's
experience in the security services form him? Or is he, as he
describes himself, a nationalist who wants a strong state sector
with the benefits of democracy?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're scrambling,'' said one intelligence official.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, much of Putin's activity will be driven by
Russia's March 26 presidential election, which polls suggest he is
almost certain to win. So far, Putin has shown himself to be astute
at garnering the support of the Russian people by encouraging the
military in Chechnya and by pledging to reinvigorate the central
powers of authority, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Clinton, who as a candidate attacked
President Bush for ``coddling'' dictators in China, must try to
ensure that Vice President Gore is not vulnerable to attack from
the Republican presidential candidates for policies considered too
lenient toward Russia.
</P>
<P>
   For the remainder of the Clinton administration, the major
policy matters with Russia will be negotiations over arms control,
continuation of loans from the International Monetary Fund and the
war in Chechnya, where the Clinton administration has accused
Moscow of using indiscriminate force.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts are now under way to reach an agreement with the
Russians on changes to the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty that
would allow the administration to proceed on a limited nuclear
missile defense system, but are not expected to reach a serious
level until summer, after the Russian election, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   From their early dealings with Putin in telephone conversations
and face-to-face meetings, senior administration officials describe
him as a serious negotiator who is precise and well prepared and
does what he promises.
</P>
<P>
   The initial take on Putin is that he sees Russia's future as a
fairly democratic one, with a market economy of some kind and
participation in the world community, the officials said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   His Kremlin advisers, they noted, run the gamut from economic
reformers to little-known intelligence operatives.
</P>
<P>
   Putin made clear his intention to restore the state's authority
in an article, ``Russia at the Turn of the Millennium'' that was
posted on his government's Internet site and has been read by
administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   Under the heading ``Statism,'' Putin wrote: ``It will not happen
soon, if it ever happens at all, that Russia will become the second
edition of, say, Britain, in which liberal values have deep
historic traditions. Our state and its institutions and structures
have always played an exceptionally important role in the life of
the country and its people.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after he became prime minister, Putin met with Clinton
in Auckland, New Zealand, and in Oslo, Norway, where Clinton gave
him a stern lecture about pushing too hard in Chechnya, White House
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has said he will not attend the gathering of world leaders
and economists at Davos, Switzerland, later this month, depriving
Clinton of a chance to take another measure of the Russian.
</P>
<P>
   Before his appointment as prime minister, Putin was Yeltsin's
national security adviser, putting him in contact with the White
House national security adviser, Sandy Berger.
</P>
<P>
   Putin was helpful on the telephone with Berger in setting the
stage for a resolution of the crisis last June when Russian troops
based in Bosnia marched across Serbia into Kosovo just as NATO
troops were deploying there as part of an international
peacekeeping force, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In another matter, Putin managed to engineer passage of
legislation that put controls on the export of nuclear materials
from Russia to Iran, the official said. But whether the export
controls were actually working or whether the inspectors installed
by Putin at the nuclear institutes were effective was an open
question, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they will be watching in the next
several weeks for what Putin does in Chechnya, where he has told
administration officials there needs to be a political solution at
some point. They will also observe whether he pushes legislation on
bankruptcy, tax reform and money laundering, and keeps his pledge
to get the Start II arms-control treaty ratified by the newly
elected Russian Parliament.

STATE IS PIPELINE FOR ILLEGAL DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAT FLANNERY AND DENNIS WAGNER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arizona is America' newest drug mainline.
</P>
<P>
   Pot, methamphetamine and heroin roll across the southern border
so fast and in such large quantities that almost no part of the
state is unaffected.
</P>
<P>
   In Nogales, storm drains pro vide a smuggling superhighway, with
traffickers parking over sewer grates to load cars through holes in
the floorboards. A barrio on the east side of town has begun to
empty because of the violence wrought by a narco-gang whose leader
lives just across the fence in Sonora, on a hill overlooking town.
</P>
<P>
   Thickets along the normally dry Colorado River bed south of Yuma
conceal a maze of trails from Baja California. When the river
flowed with runoff last spring, smugglers ferried loads across by
boat.
</P>
<P>
   Near Douglas and Naco, agents exchange gunfire with drug
``mules'' and get into smash-ups with those running the border by
car.
</P>
<P>
   In the Tohono O'odham Nation, Indian trackers pursue midnight
footprints through the desert.
</P>
<P>
   Cities away from the border also pay a price, especially Tuc son
and Phoenix, which have been transformed into distribu tion hubs,
with spokes pointing to all corners of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   It has gotten so bad that fed eral agents refer to Arizona as
``America's doormat for mari juana'' and Tucson as its ``stash
house.'' The numbers are stag gering:
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Customs agents confiscated nearly 84 tons of pot in Arizona
in fiscal 1999, four times what was seized at the start of the
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Narcotics cases filed in U.S. District Court here have nearly
tripled during the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   Total drug arrests statewide have tripled in two decades to more
than 22,000 annually.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Tucson police raided a home and found ledgers show
ing a shipment of 3,300 pounds of dope, two suspects counting
$109,000 in the kitchen, and a third guy smoking a
Cheech-and-Chong-size joint in the bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``At any given time in Tucson, there are more than 2,000 loca
tions where you can buy drugs or find stash houses,'' said Kermit
Miller, a city police captain.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix also has emerged as an importation center for dope and
crime. Last year, the Office of National Drug Control Policy
reported that more than two-thirds of the homicides in Phoe nix and
more than half the assaults were drug-related.
</P>
<P>
   Police say the narcos, fre quently paranoid and heavily armed,
kill snitches and competi tors, leaving them by roadsides with lead
in the head. Investiga tors pursuing one East Valley ring have been
stymied by the gunshot murder of at least four prospective
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Office of National Drug Control Policy, 11
``major drug trafficking organi zations'' are based in Arizona,
working directly with Mexican cartels. Countless smaller syndi
cates smuggle and distribute drugs from barrios to burbs.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't stop with narcotics. The syndicates also smuggle im
migrants, extort money, steal cars and launder money.
</P>
<P>
   They are everywhere, and no one seems able to stop them.
</P>
<P>
   A deputy says ``Go!'' as the van skids to a halt. Four SWAT team
members, armed to the teeth, race into the darkness. A concus sion
grenade rolls under the trailer as a flak-jacketed lawman bolts up
the steps to crash the front door.
</P>
<P>
   The ear-mangling boom gets every dog in Yuma barking.
</P>
<P>
   A minute or two and a lot of shouting later, two sleepy-eyed
women are led outside in hand cuffs. A small boy follows, weep ing
for his mom.
</P>
<P>
   Yuma County sheriff's Com mander Jimmy Schroeder, an exuberant
bundle of nerves, en ters the stuffy rig with his war rant in hand.
There's a bag of ``critty'' _ methamphetamine _ and a half-eaten
burrito on the kitchen counter. Schroeder starts rifling drawers
and closets. Out come several grams of foil-wrapped black-tar
heroin. From the tiny bedroom, he fishes out a handgun, a couple of
police scan ners, assorted drug pipes and two more bags of meth, a
quarter-pound in all.
</P>
<P>
   One of the women, he says, is the stepdaughter of a Mexican
smuggling chief.
</P>
<P>
   Surveying the growing stack of contraband in the kitchen,
Schroeder breaks into a joyous shuffle. His partners chortle at the
``critty dance.'' &QL; 
WHY ARIZONA?
</P>
<P>
   Until the mid-1980s, most of South America's cocaine was
smuggled into the United States via Florida. But when Dade County
drug rings started having gunbattles in broad daylight, federal
authorities cracked down.
</P>
<P>
   What happened was predictable: The cartels looked for new
routes, finding allies among Mexico's pot and heroin smugglers.
They had decades-old inroads through Texas, Arizona and California,
black-market systems that dated to Geronimo in the mid-1800s.
</P>
<P>
   Colombians paid their Mexican collaborators cash at first, then
agreed to share the coke and the U.S. market. Mexican syndicates
quickly doubled their power and exportation business.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement followed the crime, shifting its efforts from
Florida to the Southwest and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   But narco-democracy, government dominated by drug cartel money
and intimidation, was already entrenched.
</P>
<P>
   And the task was huge. Along America's southern border, there
are 39 crossings, 24 ports of entry and 2,000 miles of badlands.
</P>
<P>
   For the past six years, President Clinton has beefed up
Southwest interdiction forces in a strategy to stop the smuggling
of drugs and immigrants. The number of Border Patrol agents, now
about 8,000, has more than doubled since 1993. Nearly a quarter of
those were hired last year alone.
</P>
<P>
   California and Texas were targeted first as authorities tried to
shut down pipelines through San Diego and El Paso. The squeeze sent
more and more drug shipments through Arizona, the point of weakest
resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the past 18 months have substantial border
reinforcements landed in Arizona, chiefly in and around Nogales, an
import-export crossroad about 60 miles south of Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, traffickers swarmed east to Cochise County _
Douglas, Naco and Sierra Vista. Some have begun to move out of
Arizona altogether, back to old Caribbean routes. Drug Enforcement
Administration analysts say Colombian cartels supplying most of the
U.S. cocaine grew weary of sharing profits and drugs with Mexican
traffickers, who helped them move their supplies through Mexico and
across the Southwestern border.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of pot, however, is still coming into Arizona from
Mexican sources. Federal agencies are betting it will eventually
ebb as they put more people along the border in southeastern
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the smuggling bulge will move to rural stretches of
western Arizona, New Mexico and Texas, and that suits federal
agents just fine. Smugglers are easier to spot in remote places
than in cities.
</P>
<P>
   But no one expects it to stop. There's just too much money to be
made.
</P>
<P>
   Across the border from Douglas, at Agua Prieta's Iglesia de Gua
dalupe, the rectory is protected by double locks and window bars.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Cristobal Valenzuela says drugs are eating at the heart
of Mexico, as well as America.
</P>
<P>
   But he understands why poor campesinos take jobs as smugglers.
They are accustomed to making $4 a day, if they can find work. They
see narco-neighbors with nice cars, building new homes. They watch
TV and drive across the border on shopping sprees, seeing how
Americans live.
</P>
<P>
   What are they to think? Valen zuela wonders.
</P>
<P>
   So, they agree to carry one load of cocaine or pot across the
line. They come home with more money than they would earn in a
month. They pay the rent.
</P>
<P>
   Need gives way to greed for other things _ jewelry, cars and
stereos. So, they carry more loads. And when they've carried
enough, they move up, hiring others to be the mules.
</P>
<P>
   There is something desperate about Agua Prieta, a dirty clump of
businesses and homes, clogged at the border. Families and fur
tive-eyed young men move up and down the streets, waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Valenzuela looks outside through wrought-iron bars, shak ing his
head: ``How can we help these people? How can we feed them, bathe
them, give them shoes?'' &QL; 
GUERRILLA WARFARE
</P>
<P>
   Smuggling across Arizona's border is nothing new.
</P>
<P>
   For 150 years, bandidos, Apaches, bootleggers and gun runners
have carved black-mar ket routes along la frontera.
</P>
<P>
   What's novel these days is the volume, and the danger.
</P>
<P>
   Before retiring last July, Thomas Constantine, head of the Drug
Enforcement Administra tion, described the Arizona bor der from
Nogales to New Mexico as one of the most hazardous law enforcement
beats in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traffickers in this area are bold and confident, and less
hesitant to confront law enforce ment officers,'' he told Congress.
``Since 1992, there have been 23 documented assaults and threats
against law enforcement officers in the border area of Cochise
County.''
</P>
<P>
   The conflict is fought across an enormous and foreboding swath
of desert and mountain. U.S. agents say Mexican military units
sometimes serve as armed escorts for the drug runners.
</P>
<P>
   In the dead of night, interdic tion becomes a perilous game of
cat and mouse. Agents watch through an array of night-vision
scopes, hidden in tarp-draped vans on hillsides or lying in wait
along trails.
</P>
<P>
   The outlaws use their own technology and trickery.
</P>
<P>
   They haul dope on their backs, hide the stuff in false truck
beds and thrash across the line in four-wheel-drive trucks. A few
carve underground tunnels or fly the low-level gantlet through U.S.
Customs' radar net.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every night, there's a load. Every night, people are chasing
each other,'' said Ritchie Marti nez, an intelligence analyst for
southern Arizona's High Inten sity Drug Trafficking Area. ``We are
shouldering a lot of the nation's problems here in terms of dope.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides use quasimilitary tactics. Undercover narcs set up
stings. Smugglers use illegal im migrants as decoys. Customs agents
call in air support. Smug glers pay bribes to inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   The game has created human logjams in small towns on both sides
of the border, prompting public outcries over federal tac tics.
</P>
<P>
   Southeastern Arizona ranchers have taken up rifles and formed
makeshift posses to patrol their lands against the invasion of
smugglers and illegal immi grants.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people cut fences, (uri nate) in their water tanks,
leave trash everywhere and don't ever close a gate,'' complained
Bill Wendt, a businessman in Doug las. ``I tell you what, if you
live in this part of the country and you go out in the country,
you'd better have a gun!''
</P>
<P>
   Others, such as Raul Enriquez, owner of the T-Bone restaurant in
Douglas, view the drug war as a charade that keeps border towns
thriving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Legalize?'' Enriquez says with horror. ``We'd have a . . .
depres sion. Do you know how many people would lose their jobs?''
</P>
<P>
   The Astar chopper kicks up dust as rotor wind rips at dry scrub
below. Moving to a nearby wash, the chopper hovers as all hands
scan for bales. A smuggler pan ics, bolting from a clump of bushes.
The chopper banks and chases as one man becomes three.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes earlier, U.S. Customs pilots scrambled from Tucson's
Davis-Monthan Air Force Base. The Arizona Department of Pub lic
Safety and the U.S. Border Patrol have tailed a carload of pot to a
house in Tucson. It is a ``hot car'' sent ahead by smug glers to
grab police attention. A bigger load, it turns out, is waiting in
the desert a dozen miles north of the border, near Arivaca.
</P>
<P>
   The chopper's blinding dust storm stops the smugglers in their
tracks. Border Patrol agents round up the runners. In the wash,
they find the prize: 14 bundles of marijuana, some gift-wrapped in
Christmas paper. &QL;

UNRANKED ST. JOHN'S UPSETS UCONN, 82-77
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STORRS, Conn. _ In a game this good, in an upset this
significant, there are many pivotal plays and at least a half-dozen
key players. Lavor Postell scored 23 points and added seven
rebounds for St. John's, and they were important in an 82-77
victory over Connecticut Sunday. And who would overlook 15 strong
points from the post play of the Red Storm's Anthony Glover?
</P>
<P>
   But no man, moment or matchup meant more than the one with 2
minutes 22 seconds remaining, right after Connecticut rallied to
cut the St. John's lead from 14 points to 2.
</P>
<P>
   Erick Barkley, the ascendant point guard in the Big East,
brought the ball upcourt for the Red Storm (12-2, 4-0), an unranked
team that might be a rising conference power. Covering him was
Khalid El-Amin, the star guard of the defending national champions,
voted the Big East preseason player of the year for a team that
came into the game ranked fifth in the nation. The 10,000 fans who
jammed Gampel Pavilion rose to their feet as one, roaring for a
stop or a turnover.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two premier point guards in the Big East,'' Barkley said.
``I'm sure everybody came to see what would happen between us.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened in this instance was unusual. El-Amin, a stocky
junior with a small bandage on his left ear, stayed step for step
with Barkley, a slender sophomore with a larger bandage on his left
cheek. Suddenly, near the top of the key, El-Amin's feet flew out
from under him and he fell to the floor. This didn't change the
plans of Barkley, who said, ``I was thinking about shooting'' from
the beginning of the possession. But Barkley had time to look down
at his feet, plant himself in 3-point range and loft the shot that
clinched the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just took what he gave me,'' Barkley said with a chuckle
after finishing with 16 points, 4 assists, 5 rebounds and 5 steals.
``I knew I was going to make my shot because of all the time I had.
That shot really made it comfortable for us to take a deep breath
and just look up and say: `Wow! We're up 5 against UConn.'''
</P>
<P>
   El-Amin said, ``I don't know what happened there,'' but his
recollection of detail was pretty precise. ``I wasn't letting him
go anywhere,'' said El-Amin, who led his team with 22 points, 7
assists and 3 steals. ``He wasn't going to get by me. I slipped.
When I tried to get up, I slipped again, because I was wet and so
that made the floor wet. You can't give anybody five seconds to
shoot.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies (12-3, 1-2) got within 3 points twice after that,
but no closer. The teams meet later this season at Madison Square
Garden, and maybe again in the conference tournament or the NCAA
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had that team beat in the first half, and we stopped
attacking,'' El-Amin said, referring to Connecticut leads of 10-4
and 18-12. ``We could have blew those kids out. We've still got to
play in Madison Square Garden. So, hopefully, we can get them back.
The season is not over by any stretch of the imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   Huskies Coach Jim Calhoun said his players did not play as a
unit and should have exploited their height advantage by passing
the ball more to Jake Voskuhl, the 6-11 senior center, who had 13
points in the first half _ only 5 in the second _ and 16 rebounds.
``If they passed him the ball, he could have got 30,'' Calhoun
said.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Voskuhl received his third foul, he left the game
briefly with a twisted right ankle. When he returned with less than
nine minutes remaining, Glover took advantage, taking the ball
directly to him near the hoop and was successful three consecutive
times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw that he was hurt,'' Glover said. ``What's a better time
to get your opponent? I tried to attack his leg, which I did. I got
the up-and-under. You back him down, you try to drop-step and go
under with your right hand or your left hand.''
</P>
<P>
   St. John's Coach Mike Jarvis said Glover's early fouls and
limited minutes in the first half were a blessing in disguise
because he was fresh at the end. His team is not too tall, but
Jarvis said the Red Storm used its lack of size as an advantage.
Calhoun noticed it, saying, ``No question in my mind they
out-toughed us.'' Connecticut had only a 38-36 advantage in
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's outscored Connecticut in the paint, 50-32, and in
points off turnovers, 23-6. Calhoun said some of his players looked
as if they didn't want to be in the game. Kevin Freeman, a starting
forward, had 9 points and 3 rebounds, and Albert Mouring scored 15
points on five 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the magnitude of the victory and its effect on St.
John's national stature, Jarvis said he expected to be ranked but
added, ``I probably won't know how big this is until I go home and
listen to my wife tell me.'' Then he quickly added, ``It's huge, it
really is.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley, asked about rankings, said: ``Definitely, I think so,''
and added: ``We're just going to go from this game right here to
dictate our season. It feels good.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Storm has a six-game winning streak. The Huskies, who
had won their previous two, have lost to Iowa outside the
conference and to Notre Dame in the Big East.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's gunning for them,'' Barkley said. ``Notre Dame
really made it clear that they can be beat at their home gym. Great
teams lose, too.''
</P>
<P>
   But the St. John's fans who made the trip did not seem to think
Connecticut was a great team. ``Overrated!'' they chanted, from the
high seats in the corner, as the UConn fans began to leave early.
``Overrated!''

SHUMPERT LEADS SYRACUSE (14-0) OVER NOTRE DAME, 80-57 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. _ The Notre Dame players and coaches had seen the
tapes of Syracuse's athletic inside players floating near the
basket for alley-oop dunks.
</P>
<P>
   So the Irish, with few players who could match the Orangemen
physically, tucked their defense into a zone and dared Syracuse to
beat them from the outside, a strategy that had worked earlier this
season in upsets of Ohio State and Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   But when Syracuse struck from the outside Sunday, it came so
fast and furiously that a 1-point lead had deteriorated into a
17-point deficit before coach Matt Doherty could even consider
another strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Preston Shumpert was the prime shooter, making four 3-pointers
in a span of three minutes in the second half as the No. 7-ranked
Orangemen remained the only unbeaten team in the country with an
80-57 victory over Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   After Shumpert, a reserve sophomore forward, hit a 3-pointer 5
minutes 15 seconds into the second half, there was little response
from the crowd of 22,500 at the Carrier Dome. But the fans were
roaring when he hit three more and added a field goal in the next
three and a half minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting spree accounted for 14 of Shumpert's career-high 26
points and helped Syracuse improve to 14-0 over all and 4-0 in the
Big East. Shumpert made seven of nine 3-point attempts and matched
the school record for 3-pointers in a game, set by Dave Johnson
eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Just moments before Shumpert began his outburst, Notre Dame
(11-6, 2-1) had taken its first lead since the opening minute of
the game, 39-38. But Etan Thomas hit a pair of free throws and then
Syracuse drilled five consecutive 3-pointers, four by Shumpert and
one by Tony Bland. When Shumpert made a layup with just over 11
minutes remaining to cap the 19-1 run, Syracuse led by 57-40. The
Orangemen finished with 14 3-pointers _ one short of the school
record _ in 27 attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I could say was `unbelievable,''' Syracuse
point guard Jason Hart said of Shumpert's production. ``He busted
the game wide open when we were struggling to find buckets. I think
their coach just didn't want to put anybody on him. He kind of left
him open, if you ask me.''
</P>
<P>
   Shumpert, who leads the Big East in 3-point accuracy at 56.3
percent, was not certain when the Irish would start chasing him.
But as long as the shots were there, he was going to keep taking
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little surprised, but they were working well in the
zone in the first half,'' he said. ``They had us on our heels a
little. But once I started getting hot, I don't know what their
strategy was, but I saw that as a time for me to let loose and
that's what I did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I hit, when the crowd erupted, I wanted to shoot
more and make more. Every time they were jumping out of their
seats, I wanted to shoot more, make 10 or 20. Every shot, I just
shot with confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Shumpert became the sixth player to lead the Orangemen in
scoring this season, and the balanced squad may play a part in
confounding observers who are uncertain just how good this team is.
Syracuse began the season ranked 17th in the Associated Press news
media ranking before reaching its current lofty spot.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have pointed to the Orangemen's schedule, which began
with 10 straight home games before sending them out on the road
when the Big East season began. The Orangemen could point right
back to their recent three-game road trip, which took them to Miami
and West Virginia before ending with a 77-74 overtime victory last
Thursday at South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, they not only overcame foul trouble to Thomas, their
most dangerous inside player, with their outside shooting, but the
Orangemen were also able to blanket Troy Murphy, who entered the
game ranked second in the nation in scoring at 25.1 points a game.
While Murphy finished with 22 points and 10 rebounds, he had to
work for everything. Murphy, a sophomore forward, missed nine of
his first 12 shots and 11 of 17 for the game. It was enough to
convince him of just how good Syracuse is.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're one of the top two teams we've played,'' said Murphy,
who has shot a combined 11 for 41 (26.8 percent) from the field in
three career games against Syracuse. ``We played hard today and
they really got us. Syracuse and Arizona are the two best we've
played.''

CONGRESS URGED TO STAY OUT OF CASE OF CUBAN BOY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Fla., Ind., Miss., Ariz.)  (jw) 
 By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The president of the Cuban National Assembly and
the White House chief of staff each urged Congress Sunday not to
interfere in the question of returning a 6-year-old boy to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban official, Ricardo Alarcon, said he thought that
Congress had ``other more serious business to deal with, that you
should _ that the American people should _ ask them to concentrate
on those issues and not to be used as a tool for those kidnappers
in Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House official, John Podesta, urged Congress to leave
the resolution of the case to the federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   Each spoke against a proposal that Congress grant the boy, Elian
Gonzalez, American citizenship, which would effectively block the
Immigration and Naturalization Service from acting to send him
home.
</P>
<P>
   He has been staying with relatives in Florida since Nov. 25,
when the boat that was carrying him, his mother and other Cuban
refugees sank. His mother, Elisabet Brotons, died, and his father,
Juan Miguel Gonzalez, has asked that he be returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Alarcon, who appeared on the NBC News program ``Meet the
Press,'' said from Cuba: ``I think that citizenship is something
that should not be used for that kind of maneuvering. You cannot
impose citizenship upon anybody. And this individual, this
6-year-old boy, has not requested anything, and he cannot, legally
speaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the father clearly doesn't want him to be deprived, not
only for his son, but to deprive his son, after having deprived him
of his father and his four grandparents, also of his nationality.
This is going too far, really.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of granting American citizenship to Elian was proposed
late last week by Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., and four members of the
House of Representatives. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss., has endorsed it.
</P>
<P>
   Podesta said: ``The best place for this to be decided is in a
court of law, rather than in the halls of Congress. But, you know,
we'll have to wait and see what they propose and take that on when
they get back to town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certain members, obviously of the leadership, have suggested
that they want to pass legislation when they first return to town,
and we'll have to see what they come up with when they propose
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Podesta, who appeared on the ABC News program ``This Week,''
also took note of an effort by Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., to keep
Elian in the United States by issuing a subpoena for his testimony
before Congress and said, ``Our position has been: let's try to
keep this, as best we can, out of politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Alarcon said in a second television appearance, on ``Fox News
Sunday,'' that the citizenship proposal was ``absolutely
nonsense,'' and he added, ``Congress is supposed to be a serious
institution and not an instrument to permit what amounts to a
kidnapping of a small boy.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the candidates for the Republican nomination for
president, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said he supported granting
citizenship to the child.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' he answered when the question was put to him on ``Meet
the Press.'' ``We've done that to so many others who have been able
to escape.'' In answer to another question, he said that as
president he would not return Elian to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who was a prisoner of war in Vietnam, said: ``I have had
some experience with Communist governments, and there are millions
of Americans that have, too. Ask any of them who lived under it
what it was like and whether we should condemn that young boy to
it, and especially since his mother made the ultimate sacrifice in
order that he might breathe free.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Cuba's foreign minister left for Europe on Sunday to
seek support for the boy's return.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is inconceivable and unacceptable that this small child
remains kidnapped,'' Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Roque told
Cuba's Prensa Latina news service, according to The Associated
Press. He was to visit Italy, San Marino, France, Denmark and
Russia and also meet with Vatican and Spanish officials before
returning to Cuba on Jan. 28.

CHILEAN SOCIALIST NARROWLY ELECTED PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile _ Ricardo Lagos brought Chile's left a sweet
triumph Sunday night, winning a narrow victory to become the
country's first Socialist president since President Salvador
Allende Gossens was overthrown in a bloody coup in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Lagos, a 61-year-old who in the 1980s helped lead the fight
against the dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, defeated Joaquin
Lavin, a former aide to Pinochet, after a campaign in which both
left and right appeared to overcome Chile's polarized past. Lagos'
supporters celebrated with a festive caravan of honking cars
through Santiago on this hot summer night.
</P>
<P>
   But the election also marked a comeback for the right, which had
failed to mount credible campaigns in the last two presidential
elections, because of its long association with the fallen
dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   With 99.75 percent of the vote in, Lagos led Lavin, 51.32
percent to 48.68 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``A new spirit is spreading across our territory,'' Lagos said
to 20,000 supporters who waved the Socialist and Christian
Democratic party flags of the governing coalition in Constitution
Plaza. After recognizing Allende's widow in the audience, he said:
``I want to resolve the pains of our past. There is space here for
everyone. I haven't forgotten the past, but my eyes are open to the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Before a final vote count was in, Lavin left television
commentators breathless when he went to Lagos' hotel headquarters
and embraced the Socialist candidate on a flag-draped balcony,
while their wives did the same.
</P>
<P>
   The gesture of conciliation between right and left would have
been impossible just a few years ago, but on Sunday night the two
politicians appeared to seize the moment to say that the country
could be unified after three decades of revolution,
counterrevolution and an uneasy transition to democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will always be with Ricardo Lagos and with Chile,'' Lavin
said as he conceded defeat. ``I am at his disposal to help unify
Chile.''
</P>
<P>
   A former minister of both education and public works, Lagos
appeared to put together enough votes to win by attracting voters
for minor left-wing candidates in the first round. He also
conducted a more credible and imaginative campaign in recent weeks
to gain support among Christian Democrats and women.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible, some analysts suggested, that reports last
Tuesday from London that Pinochet would probably soon be released
because of ill health rather than face extradition and trial in
Spain on human rights charges came in just in time to help Lagos.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet's apparent imminent return may well have reminded
voters of the human rights violations of the dictatorship just as
Lavin was attempting to eclipse the dictatorship and his role in it
as a campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   Lavin's strong showing was a result in large part of to a
creative, marketing-driven campaign that used the slogan ``Long
live change.'' Candidates are not required here to reveal how much
they spend or who their contributors are, but most analysts say
Lavin may well have outspent Lagos by 3-to-1 or more.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the very closeness of the race between Lagos, and Lavin,
46, marked a break from the past. In the two previous presidential
elections held since Pinochet agreed to step down in 1989, the
governing Christian Democratic-Socialist coalition won in
landslides as the right failed to brush off its identification with
the fallen dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time we have an election in which anything can
happen,'' said Marta Lagos, an independent pollster who is not
related to the presidential candidate. ``We're sick and tired of
the extreme colors. Now we want a gray, modern country.''
</P>
<P>
   How much Chile has changed could be seen at the polling places
at National Stadium, where after the coup against Allende in 1973,
Chilean troops and policemen gathered thousands of Allende
supporters for executions and torture.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday thousands of voters peacefully formed neat lines to
vote, while troops wearing red berets watched from a distance.
Government officials said there were no reports of irregularities
or violence anywhere in the country throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``This election is about choosing a president with new ideas,''
said Juan Morales, a 25-year-old business student who came to vote
in a surfing T-shirt and refused to say whom he voted for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lagos is a renovated Socialist, not an Allende Socialist who
thinks the state should manage everything, while Lavin is a
practical man who knows how to administer resources,'' he said.
``They both have something to offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Lagos repeatedly distanced himself from traditional positions of
his Socialist Party, in large part to shore up his support with
Christian Democrats and with women, who tend to be more traditional
and conservative than men in Chile.
</P>
<P>
   He supported the government's efforts to fight Pinochet's
extradition from Britain to stand trial on human rights charges in
Spain, a position that riled his more left-wing supporters. He also
trumpeted his good relations with Wall Street investors.
</P>
<P>
   After his surprise virtual tie with Lavin in last month's
first-round vote, he emphasized crime prevention as a major issue
in the second-round campaign, promising to hire more police
officers. In one of his final television advertisements, he
appeared before a vandalized taxicab, with his arms crossed and
looking like a tough prosecutor, urging criminals not to vote for
him.
</P>
<P>
   Lavin, meanwhile, broke new ground for the right by meeting with
relatives of those who disappeared during the dictatorship era and
by suggesting he would cut military spending.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after Pinochet was arrested on a Spanish warrant in
London in October 1998, Lavin spoke at a rally in support of the
former dictator and even visited him in London as a gesture of
solidarity. But as the campaign progressed, Lavin distanced himself
from Pinochet, and repeatedly promised that he would not step in
the way of a future trial of the general in Chile once he returns.
</P>
<P>
   Though he served for seven years as mayor of the upscale Las
Condes neighborhood of Santiago, Lavin repeatedly posed as an
outsider who would represent a change from a generation of
old-fashioned politicians. He promised to sell the presidential jet
and to appoint people of all parties to top posts in his
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``As president, I am not going to lose a minute on political
fighting,'' Lavin said at a last-minute campaign appearance on
Saturday.

</P>
<P>
   Both candidates voiced populist positions in their campaigns.
Lagos promised to create hundreds of thousands of jobs, while Lavin
pledged to bring superior educational opportunities to the children
of the poorest of the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Striking one of the more traditional Socialist notes in the
campaign, in the final week Lagos promised to deliver better health
care to all Chileans, declaring, ``Health is a right, not a
business.''
</P>
<P>
   But more than anything else, the two candidates tried to appeal
to voters with nuts-and-bolts approaches to issues, like promises
to deliver better government services by using modern computers and
to offer special national telephone call-in lines for citizens with
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny margin between two candidates who expressed few policy
differences on the stump and who studiously avoided the
controversies of the past also appeared to reflect an emerging
political consensus in favor of free-market policies initiated by
General Pinochet and then softened by government social welfare
policies initiated over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   Chile has enjoyed one of the most successful economic
performances in Latin America in recent years. Its average annual
economic growth rate of better than 5 percent since the mid 1980s
has surpassed all but a handful of nations.
</P>
<P>
   And while the income gap between rich and poor is wide, as it is
all over Latin America, the sharp decreases in infant mortality and
illiteracy suggest that the lives of the poor have improved in the
last two decades.
</P>
<P>
   A sharp recession last year gave impetus for Lavin's call for
change, but in recent weeks government reports indicate that
unemployment is declining. The Chilean peso has been gaining
strength, and the local stock market has been climbing in recent
weeks _ signs that businessmen and international investors feel
comfortable with both candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But even as both candidates avoided speaking of the painful past
and declined to criticize each other sharply, both have
professional histories that span the old polarized, conflictive
past to the more peaceful present.
</P>
<P>
   As a young man, Lagos was a strong supporter of Allende, the
Socialist president ousted by Pinochet. Lagos was slated to be
Allende's ambassador to Moscow at the time of the 1973 military
coup.
</P>
<P>
   Lagos spent much of his exile in the United States, where he
served as a visiting professor at the University of North Carolina.
In the 1980s, he helped lead the opposition to Pinochet and take
the Socialist Party from its traditional Marxist orientation to a
more democratic direction.
</P>
<P>
   Lavin began his career as an acolyte to Pinochet. After studying
economics at the University of Chicago, Lavin served as a minor
functionary in the Planning Ministry. Later he worked as a business
editor at the conservative Santiago newspaper El Mercurio and wrote
several books praising the general's economic policies.
</P>
<P>
   After unsuccessfully running for Congress as a hard-right-winger
who went by the nickname ``the fighting cock'' in the late 1980s,
he ran for mayor of Las Condes as a moderate in 1992. As mayor, he
tried to use free-market tools to improve health and housing
services for his more disadvantaged constituents.
</P>
<P>
   The similar campaign positions of the two candidates estranged
many on the left, who in past years would have been expected to
endorse a Socialist over a former aide to Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no alternative,'' said Gladys Marin, who won 3
percent of the vote as the Communist candidate in the first round,
as she announced Sunday that she had nullified her ballot. ``The
two candidates represent the same thing _ neoliberalism, low wages,
and no pensions for women who work in the home.''

POLITICAL MOTIVE SUSPECTED IN KILLING OF SERBIAN GUERRILLA 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ The Serbian authorities on Sunday
provided few details of the assassination on Saturday of Zeljko
Raznatovic, a notorious Serbian paramilitary leader known as Arkan,
who was wanted on war crimes charges in the Bosnian and Croatian
wars.
</P>
<P>
   But officials of political parties here said Raznatovic, worried
about his security, had made overtures to the Serbian political
opposition in the last few months.
</P>
<P>
   They said he had traveled to Montenegro, Serbia's sister
republic, which is led by President Milo Djukanovic. Raznatovic
supported Djukanovic's election in 1997 against the wishes of
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia. But Djukanovic, who is
supported by the West, made clear to Raznatovic that as an indicted
war criminal he could not remain in Montenegro, these officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Raznatovic was killed in the lobby of the Intercontinental Hotel
here, shot three times in the face by gunmen about 5:15 p.m. as he
emerged with friends from the hotel restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   He was taken to Belgrade's main emergency hospital, where he was
pronounced dead.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate assumption here was that the Milosevic government
had ordered and carried out the killing, because Raznatovic knew
too much about the activities of Milosevic and his associates
during the Bosnian and Croatian wars that raged from 1991 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main question was not whether Arkan would be killed, but
when,'' said Slavoljub Kacarevic, editor-in-chief of the
independent daily Glas Javnosti.
</P>
<P>
   Late on Saturday night, Raznatovic's followers, some of whom are
members of paramilitary groups who live in a sort of plush barracks
in Belgrade, went to his huge, modern house in the rich suburb of
Dedinje, where Milosevic also lives, and fired their guns in the
air in mourning.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say at least 500 families in Belgrade owe their
livelihoods directly to Raznatovic, who had businesses both open
and shady, ranging from bakeries to currency exchanges, oil
smuggling and a casino.
</P>
<P>
   His Serbian National Guard, known as the Tigers, was active in
the Bosnian and Croatian wars and were responsible for murder,
looting and so-called ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   Raznatovic was secretly indicted by the war crimes tribunal in
The Hague in 1997, apparently for events in Bosnia and in Vukovar,
Croatia, where 250 Croats were taken from a hospital and murdered.
The tribunal disclosed that he was under indictment only during
NATO's bombing campaign against Serbia last spring, but the
document detailing the charges has not been unsealed.
</P>
<P>
   A tribunal spokesman, Paul Risley, said in a telephone interview
on Sunday that lawyers asserting that they represented Raznatovic
had contacted the tribunal, exploring the idea of Raznatovic
turning himself in and agreeing to testify.
</P>
<P>
   Risley suggested that Raznatovic's fate might encourage other
wanted men, including the Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and
former Gen. Ratko Mladic, to consider turning themselves in to the
relative safety of a Dutch prison cell.
</P>
<P>
   Raznatovic had close ties to the Serbian and Yugoslav
intelligence services and secret police, carrying a membership card
in the Federal State Security police.
</P>
<P>
   In the shooting, two other men were also killed, a former
business associate named Milovan Mandic, known as Manda, and Dragan
Garic, a high-level police official who worked in the Interior
Ministry, political officials said, confirming a report in Glas
Javosti.
</P>
<P>
   Kacarevic, the editor, said on Sunday that his newspaper
believed that there had been two gunmen with automatic Heckler and
Koch machine pistols, and that one of them had been wounded but
crawled out of the hotel. Both managed to escape. A woman who was
passing by was also hurt, apparently trying to flee the carnage.
</P>
<P>
   There were at least 38 shell casings on the floor of the hotel
lobby, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Raznatovic, 47, was said to have been accompanied by his wife,
the popular singer Svetlana Raznatovic, known as Ceca, and their
two children, as well as his sister-in-law, Lidija Velickovic.
Raznatovic's wife and sister-in-law are said to own a boutique for
luxury goods in the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Some news reports said Ms. Velickovic had been injured, but
Kacarevic said she had not been, and had in fact organized the
transport of Raznatovic to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The attack had all the characteristics of previous gangland
style killings here of public figures _ a police chief, other
senior police officials, a top journalist and shady business
figures with ties to the Milosevic family or the government.
</P>
<P>
   The former chief of Serbia's uniformed police and the editor of
an independent daily who was once close to Milosevic's wife,
Mirjana Markovic, but then turned away from her are among those who
have been gunned down in public in recent years, with no arrests
ever made.
</P>
<P>
   Another indicted war crime suspect who was said to have led
paramilitary forces in Bosnia, Slobodan Miljkovic, died in a hail
of bullets in 1998 in the Serbian town of Kragujevac.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a memorial service for Raznatovic on Tuesday and a
funeral on Wednesday. In the meantime, his body will be at the
headquarters of his party, the Party of Serbian Unity.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian opposition parties called Raznatovic's killing
emblematic of Serbia's condition under Milosevic's rule. The
Serbian Renewal Movement of Vuk Draskovic, who says the secret
police tried to murder him in a car crash last October, said the
killing was ``confirmation that we live in a country of state
terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement on the Belgrade television channel it controls,
Studio B, Draskovic's party said, ``Such brutal executions aim to
spread fear and general insecurity among citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Later on Sunday, Studio B said one of its main transmitters had
been sabotaged, cutting off up to 2 million viewers _ half of its
possible audience _ in central Serbia. Studio B's signal is often
jammed in Belgrade and elsewhere, with the government blaming NATO.
The station said the sabotage had occurred after it had managed to
bypass the jamming.

UCLA's SUFFERING ENDS 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The talk around Westwood this week, as far as what
Maylana Martin heard, bordered on desperation.
</P>
<P>
   USC had ended UCLA's win streak in football in November and in
men's basketball Wednesday. Martin heard the pleas: ``You guys are
our last hope. Redeem our school.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerned Bruins fans can relax, at least until Feb. 12, when
the teams play in the Sports Arena. By beating USC 82-62 on Sunday,
No. 14 UCLA won its fifth in a row over the Trojans, turning a
close game into a rout with a 19-4 run to start the second half
before a crowd of 7,787 mostly underaged fans. It was the
fourth-largest Pauley Pavilion crowd ever to watch a women's
basketball game.
</P>
<P>
   Martin scored eight of her 20 points in the second half's first
7:16, and Janae Hubbard scored seven of her 19 points in that span.
Nothing new there: UCLA (9-4, 3-0) often holds a post advantage
over USC (7-6, 2-1). Martin's career bests in points and rebounds
came last year at USC. Hubbard, meanwhile, looked sharper at game's
end than usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``This week, I tried to hustle more in practice,'' Hubbard said.
``I felt stronger. I put in the effort this week and it paid off.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA also received 18 points from freshman Nicole Kaczmarski,
often coming from inside penetration.
</P>
<P>
   Still, USC was as responsible for the run as anything UCLA did.
And it wasn't just an inability to stop the Bruins' penetration.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans trailed just 40-35 at the half because of some
success on defense. Although USC didn't think it played well in the
first half, its man-to-man defense posed trouble for UCLA's guards,
leading to 14 turnovers. But USC couldn't sustain, beginning the
second half fouling early and often. With 12:14 to play, USC had 10
team fouls and UCLA had made nine of 11 free throws.
</P>
<P>
   When USC finally got into the bonus, it couldn't make enough
free throws, missing several front ends of one-and-ones and
finishing 14 of 24. The Trojans also made just 10 of 34 second-half
shots (29.4 percent) and finished at 36 percent (23 of 64).
</P>
<P>
   ``We missed tons of free throws,'' USC coach Chris Gobrecht
said. ``Had we hit our free throws, we could've stayed in the game,
maybe close enough to make another run. . . . We didn't come out
strong opening the second half. Our inability to handle the dribble
penetration (was one factor). We played timidly defensively. If you
back off, you'll get eaten alive.''
</P>
<P>
   USC received 20 points from Danielle Golay and 14 points from
Denise Woods.

EDITORIAL: REPUBLICAN TAX-CUT PLANS
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Jan. 17:
</P>
<P>
   With the release of Sen. John McCain's tax-cut plan, the
profound differences between his priorities and those of the
front-runner for the Republican nomination, Gov. George W. Bush,
become clear. Nearly any proposal to cut federal income taxes
benefits high-income families since they pay most income taxes.
McCain's and Bush's plans are no exception. But McCain's version
largely bypasses low-income and very rich families, focusing
instead on families earning between $65,000 and $130,000 a year.
Bush showers benefits on very wealthy families but also cuts rates
on low-paid workers.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond who gets the tax cuts, there is an important issue of
scale. McCain, playing to moderates in both parties and traditional
conservatives in his own party, proposes modest-sized cuts by
Republican standards. Bush proposes a tax cut that is about three
times larger. Only the Bush plan is fiscally reckless.
</P>
<P>
   McCain boasted that his plan would provide important relief for
low-income families. It would not. To reduce federal taxes on
low-income families requires cutting Social Security and Medicare
payroll taxes, which neither candidate proposes. The central
feature of the McCain plan would extend the 15 percent tax bracket,
which now covers families with incomes up to about $40,000, to
families with incomes up to about $70,000. This provision does
nothing for families already in the 15 percent bracket _ more than
two-thirds of taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Bush tilts his tax-cut plan toward high-income families by
cutting their rates and making them eligible for tax breaks that
are now limited to lower-income families. Under the plan, the
wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers would get almost 40 percent of
the tax cuts. But Bush would also cut the bottom tax rate to 10
percent from 15 percent. Robert McIntyre of Citizens for Tax
Justice, a liberal research center that uses standard economic
models, estimates that about 5 percent of the tax cuts under the
McCain plan would go to the bottom 60 percent of the population.
Under the Bush plan, the number would be about 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   There are other undesirable features of the Bush and McCain
plans. Both would slash taxes on multimillion-dollar estates.
McCain would permit taxpayers to invest 2.5 percent of their
salaries in private retirement accounts rather than paying the
money into the Social Security trust fund. Private accounts would
prove unattractive to low-paid workers because administrative costs
eat up a large percentage of small contributions. Worse, as
high-income families peel away from the trust fund, the Social
Security program would lose some of its ability to redistribute
income from high-paid to low-paid workers.
</P>
<P>
   McIntyre estimates that McCain would cut taxes by about $500
billion over 10 years, less than a third of the $1.7 trillion tax
cut proposed by Bush. That means the McCain plan would preserve
more money for education and other federal programs and for paying
off federal debt _ two ways to help the economy grow before the
baby boomers retire and drive up the costs of Medicare and Social
Security. McCain promises to offset much of the cost of his tax cut
by eliminating corporate loopholes. That is a fine idea, except
that Congress habitually tosses such ideas aside once the lobbyists
swarm Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The two tax plans are more a roadmap to campaign strategies than
a blueprint for tax reform. Bush pitches his plan to those who want
to starve government programs. McCain's mission is different,
promising to pump money into the Social Security and Medicare trust
funds. Because the money would not be needed over the next decade
or so to support retirees, it would be used to buy back government
bonds from the public _ a feature that will appeal to traditional
fiscal conservatives in the party who like the idea of paying off
the national debt. Yet there is a thread that runs through the
McCain and Bush plans and every other Republican income-tax plan.
Each piles most of the benefits on the families who least need
help.

EDITORIAL: WHEN PRISONERS HAVE HIV 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Jan. 17:
</P>
<P>
   An Alabama prison policy that excludes HIV-positive inmates from
programs open to other prisoners was upheld by an appeals court on
dubious grounds and now needs Supreme Court review.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has urged the high court not to take
the case, because there is no clear legal conflict among federal
appeals courts on this issue. But the ruling by the 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals, if allowed to stand, leaves Alabama
inmates who have HIV subject to unfair discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama is one of a few states that bar all HIV-positive inmates
from participating in programs where they might mix with the
general prison population. The inmates sued on grounds that the
policy violates the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which prohibits a
federally financed state program from discriminating against
individuals on the basis of their disability.
</P>
<P>
   The inmates did not contest their segregated housing, but
challenged their exclusion from some 70 prison programs available
to other inmates, including work-release programs, college classes
and recreational activities. Some programs, such as chapel
services, were provided on a segregated basis to HIV-positive
inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama argued in federal court that HIV infection posed a
``significant risk'' to other inmates that could not be eliminated
by ``reasonable accommodation.'' The federal appeals court affirmed
a trial court's decision that the exclusion policy was justified
because the potential for violence in prisons might result in
blood-to-blood contact, making transmission of the virus possible.
</P>
<P>
   The policy is not based on an assessment of individual inmates'
records for violence or particular situations that might result in
conflict. The appeals court seems simply to accept the trial
court's analysis that participation by HIV-positive inmates in all
programs _ including even data-processing classes _ poses a risk of
infection to others.
</P>
<P>
   Prison administrators are generally allowed great deference in
making security judgments. But this overly broad analysis of risk
punishes inmates solely because of their HIV status, and should be
overturned.

 By JODY GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
ST. LOUIS _ Even though he was the NFL's Most Valuable Player this
season, there were plenty of people who had never seen St. Louis
Rams quarterback Kurt Warner play.
<TEXT>
<P>
   He made the highlight reels nearly every week, but after the
Rams' less-than-impressive seasons throughout the '90s, the
schedule-makers didn't see fit to give St. Louis any national
television games in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   When he finally got the national spotlight Sunday, Warner made
good use of it, throwing five touchdown passes to lead the Rams to
a 49-37 divisional playoff victory over the Minnesota Vikings. St.
Louis will host Tampa Bay in the NFC Championship Game on Jan. 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we painted a glaring picture that we don't have any
obvious weaknesses,'' St. Louis coach Dick Vermeil said.
</P>
<P>
   Warner needed all of 11 seconds to put the Rams on the
scoreboard. On his first play from scrimmage, he threw up a pass to
Isaac Bruce, who made one defender miss and sailed into the end
zone for a 77-yard touchdown that put the Rams up 7-3.
</P>
<P>
   As with the Jacksonville Jaguars, the dominance of the Rams
(14-3) has been called into question because of a soft schedule.
But like the Jaguars, who stomped Miami 62-7 one day earlier, St.
Louis didn't leave room for doubters. The final score might have
looked respectable, but the Vikings (11-7) had to score three
touchdowns in the final five minutes to narrow what had become a
49-17 deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw one sign as we left that said, `Ha, we still haven't
played anybody,''' Warner said.
</P>
<P>
   Warner, who threw for 4,353 yards and 41 touchdowns in the
regular season and had a passer rating of 109.2, completed 27 of 33
attempts for 391 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's special,'' Vermeil said. ``That's a pretty good day's
work.''
</P>
<P>
   And the St. Louis defense, which ranked sixth in the NFL, was
successful in shutting down the league's third-ranked offense when
the game was still on the line. The Vikings, who had taken a 17-14
lead into halftime, netted minus-two yards in the third quarter as
the Rams surged to a 35-17 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Vikings quarterback Jeff George finished 29-for-50 for 424
yards. But he threw four interceptions (to one for Warner), and
half of his yardage came after the game was out of hand. George
also was sacked four times for minus-35 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota's Randy Moss had a 188-yard, two-touchdown receiving
performance but couldn't cross the goal line until less than four
minutes remained.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't hold Minnesota to minus-two yards in the third
quarter without playing well,'' Vermeil said.
</P>
<P>
   If it was the Falcons' offense that ended Minnesota's dream
season last year, it will be the Rams' attack giving them
nightmares this offseason. All afternoon, Minnesota defenders were
diving and catching only air as the Rams blew past the league's
30th-ranked pass defense.
</P>
<P>
   After the Rams had run just two offensive plays, Bruce had 103
yards receiving. After five plays, Warner had thrown for 155 yards
and two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew yesterday that we were going to come out and run that
play (to Bruce as the opener), and I went over about every scenario
in my head,'' Warner said. ``It was nice to get out there and run
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Faulk scored the second touchdown off a screen pass. He
cut right to evade one tackler, then sprinted 41 yards untouched to
put St. Louis on top 14-3.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings' strategy was to run the football and control the
clock, thus keeping the No. 1 offense in the league off the field
as much as possible. It didn't quite work as hoped. The Vikings had
the ball for 12:44 and St. Louis for only 2:16 in the first
quarter, but only because St. Louis' two touchdown drives took a
mere 2:06 to execute.
</P>
<P>
   There were big plays on special teams as well, none more
significant than Tony Horne's 95-yard kickoff return to start the
second half, giving the Rams a 21-17 lead.
</P>
<P>
   That sparked five unanswered scores for St. Louis, the other
four coming on a one-yard run by Faulk, a 13-yard pass to Jeff
Robinson, a one-yard pass to Ryan Tucker and a two-yard pass to
Roland Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had great stamina,'' Vermeil said. ``There was a lot of
fuel in our tank when we came out at halftime.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings had taken a brief lead before the intermission after
a pair of late touchdown drives, one capped by a 22-yard pass from
George to Cris Carter, the other coming on a four-yard spinning run
by fullback Leroy Hoard.
</P>
<P>
   Both came after St. Louis miscues. Minnesota cornerback Jimmy
Hitchcock picked off a pass at the Minnesota four to begin Carter's
scoring drive. Safety Robert Griffith picked up a Warner fumble at
the Minnesota 47 to spark the second touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Said Vermeil: ``(At halftime), I told them, `We're only down by
three. They've taken their best shots. Now, we'll deliver ours.'''
</P>
<P>
   And the Rams are certain they have plenty left to deliver next
weekend against the Buccaneers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't have called everything we had in our game plan if
we played three weeks in a row,'' Vermeil said.

ESTRONGO NACHAMA, 81, CHIEF CANTOR OF BERLIN'S JEWS
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Estrongo Nachama, the chief cantor of the Berlin Jewish
community and the man who did as much as anyone to revive Jewish
life in the city after Hitler destroyed it, died on Thursday. He
was 81.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was a heart attack, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Vigorous to the last, eyes always glimmering, his voice scarcely
affected by age, Nachama exuded the passion for life of a man who
had seen the worst horrors and come through. He was an Auschwitz
survivor, spared because his voice pleased the SS guards, who
particularly enjoyed his rendering of ``O Sole Mio.''
</P>
<P>
   His family, all sent to Auschwitz after the Nazis took control
of northern Greece, where Nachama was born, was less fortunate. His
parents, a sister and many relatives were all killed by the Nazis
at the camp.
</P>
<P>
   While forever marked by this loss, Nachama was an inveterate
optimist of seemingly boundless energy. On his 80th birthday, he
declared, ``I will sing for as long as God allows me'' _ and he
did, coaching bar mitzvah students until the day before his death.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of the absolutely critical people in terms of the
rebuilding of the Jewish community in Berlin,'' said Tom
Freudenheim, the deputy director of the city's Jewish museum.
``Before the wall fell, he would cross to the East with a special
pass to conduct services there. In his day, his voice was famous
well beyond this city.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1947, when Nachama became cantor, the Jews of Berlin had
almost all departed or died. Today, with the Jewish population
swollen by an influx of Jews from Russia and other Central and
Eastern European countries, about 12,000 people are registered
members of the Jewish community and several thousand more are known
to live here.
</P>
<P>
   Estrongo Nachama was born in Salonika, Greece, the son of a
prosperous grain merchant. He was to have taken over the family
business, but the Nazis sent his entire family to Auschwitz in
1943.
</P>
<P>
   A splendid tenor, Nachama earned the nickname ``the singer of
Auschwitz.'' His voice saved his life. When the camp was closed in
1945, Nachama was pressed into a ``death march'' back to Germany.
Sick with typhoid, he was ultimately freed by Soviet troops near
Berlin in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   On his recovery, he planned to take a train back to Greece. But
he grew close to a Christian family that had taken him in and
quickly became active in what was left of the Jewish community. In
the end, he never left.
</P>
<P>
   His voice became well known in the city and was broadcast on
Friday nights by the radio service in the American sector of
Berlin. He worked tirelessly for an improved understanding between
Jews and Christians and became one of the first prominent German
Jews to attend church congresses.
</P>
<P>
   When, last September, Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel became
the first foreign leader to visit Germany after the government
moved back to Berlin, Nachama was at his side during a service at
the Sachsenhausen concentration camp near the capital. His voice
rising over the bleak scene of horror was one of tremulous beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Nachama is survived by his wife, Lily, a son, Andreas, who is
the leader of the city's Jewish community, and two grandchildren.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: A GOOD TIME FOR CANDOR ABOUT AFRICA'S LEADERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BILL BERKELEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Clinton administration and its new representative at the
United Nations, Richard Holbrooke, have embarked on a laudable
month-long effort to focus the world's attention on the multiple
overlapping crises in Africa. In using its presidency of the
Security Council to schedule debates on Angola, Congo and Burundi
in particular, the administration brings a long-overdue sense of
urgency to these ruinous conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   But an opportunity for productive American leadership will be
lost if the debates do not include a candid recognition that some
of Washington's allies in the region are compounding the very
problems it now seeks to resolve.
</P>
<P>
   It seems only yesterday that the United States was hailing the
advent of a ``new generation'' of African leaders bent on rooting
out the corrupt and brutal era of strongman politics that had
blighted the continent for a generation. President Clinton produced
the climactic moment during his tour of Africa in April 1998. At a
meeting in Uganda with six of these new-found allies, he embraced
the ``new generation'' as harbingers of an ``African renaissance.''
</P>
<P>
   Within months of Clinton's visit, alas, nearly all of these
leaders were at war with one another. Laurent Kabila of Congo, who
had liberated that vast nation from America's longtime Cold War
client Mobutu Sese Seko, turned out to be a predatory thug.
</P>
<P>
   Then the dean of the ``new generation,'' Uganda's Yoweri
Museveni, and his protege, Rwanda's Paul Kagame, who had backed
Kabila's war against Mobutu, grew disillusioned with their progeny
and launched yet another armed insurrection to replace him _
yielding the present intractable conflict that has drawn in a
half-dozen surrounding nations and now counts civilian casualties
in the hundreds of thousands.
</P>
<P>
   In the Horn of Africa, meanwhile, Issaias Afwerki of Ethiopia
and Meles Zenawi of Eritrea, two charismatic former guerrilla
allies, set upon each other in a remote border conflict that has
claimed tens of thousands of lives in trench combat reminiscent of
World War I.
</P>
<P>
   What went wrong? For all their impressive talk, our African
allies had little in common apart from their success at beating
discredited predecessors at their own game. They all achieved power
through the use of force, and that is how they are inclined to hold
onto it. Ultimately they, no less than those whom they ousted, are
accountable to no one save their own armed constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   Washington was understandably eager to do business with a new
generation of articulate leaders who at least embraced
market-oriented economic reforms if not democratic systems of
accountability. Museveni, to his credit, had brought a welcome
measure of stability to his own war-battered country. Kagame drew
sympathy as a leader of Rwanda's decimated Tutsis after the
genocide of 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But the Clinton administration has been slow to come to terms
with the fact that all these men have shown a recklessness with the
lives of defenseless civilians that is the hallmark of men grown
accustomed to unaccountable power. The names and faces have
changed, but the nature of the game is the same.
</P>
<P>
   Even the best-intentioned among them are now trapped in
Macbethian logic, compelled to shed ever more blood merely to
survive.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has belatedly distanced itself from Kabila in
Congo, but it remains closely identified with Museveni and Kagame,
even as they have launched or provoked one blood bath after
another.
</P>
<P>
   It has rarely rebuked them for their recklessness, maintaining
strong diplomatic, military and economic ties that have left the
impression across the continent that they enjoy unwavering American
support. In turn, they have behaved as if they believed they had
carte blanche to pursue their dangerous adventures.
</P>
<P>
   Both Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright have
forthrightly acknowledged America's Cold War complicity with
tyrants and warlords across the continent whose crimes paved the
way for today's conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   The list is lamentably long: Mobutu in Zaire, Samuel Doe in
Liberia, Gafaar al-Nimeiry in Sudan, Mohammed Siad Barre in Somalia
and the Angolan rebel Jonas Savimbi, who now perpetuates a
pointless war with the benefit of diamond smuggling revenue. But
the administration has been slower to recognize that a
well-intentioned effort to forge special relationships with less
malevolent but no more accountable leaders has failed to arrest
their destructive tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke has called on Congo's warring parties to comply with a
peace agreement that has languished since last July. His appeal
will amount to little if Washington does not also clearly signal to
its closest allies that at long last it is ready to use its
considerable diplomatic and economic influence to hold them
accountable for their reckless adventures.
</P>
<P>
   This is not just a policy prescription from afar. It is what
Africans themselves across a broad spectrum are daily risking their
lives and livelihoods for: accountable government and the rule of
law.

CIA TELLS CLINTON AN IRANIAN A-BOMB CAN'T BE RULED OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (EXCLUSIVE; 10:45 p.m. ET EMBARGO for print media; 12:01 a.m. ET

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a sharp departure from its previous assessment
of Iran's nuclear capacity, the CIA has told senior Clinton
administration officials that Iran might now be able to make a
nuclear weapon, according to several U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
   George Tenet, director of central intelligence, began briefings
in December about the agency's new assessment, shortly after the
document was completed, the officials said. The new evaluation has
touched off a sharp debate about Iran's nuclear capacity, and the
CIA's ability to monitor it.
</P>
<P>
   CIA officials refused to comment on the new assessment. But the
more ominous evaluation of Iran's nuclear capacity, which was
described to The New York Times by American officials, is
apparently not based on evidence that Iran's indigenous efforts to
build a bomb have achieved a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, it seems to be based on the fact that the United States
cannot track with great certainty increased efforts by Iran to
acquire nuclear materials and technology on the international black
market, mainly from the former Soviet Union, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA has found it difficult to track such transactions, and
thus the assessment has been carefully hedged by its analysts.
Washington has also made little headway with efforts to weaken the
longstanding strategic relationship between Iran and Russia, which
is brimming with nuclear weapons and stockpiles of the fissile
material Tehran needs to make a nuclear bomb.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has told policy-makers that it is not certain that
Iran actually has atomic weapons now. Instead, the new assessment
says that the CIA can no longer rule out the possibility that Iran
has acquired them, in contrast to previous assessments that
excluded that possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Even with those caveats, the CIA's new assessment has prompted
strong debate within the government. The new analysis is being
disputed by Clinton administration policy-makers and some analysts
at other American intelligence agencies who believe that Iran's
efforts to build its own bomb are still moving slowly, American
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   They say there is no evidence that Iran has succeeded in
building its own weapon, or that it has stolen or acquired enough
fissile material to make one. The CIA began to warn policy-makers
nearly a decade ago that Iran was likely to have nuclear weapons
around the turn of the century. Now that the new century has
arrived, the agency is offering a cautious warning that it can no
longer be sure whether Iran has made more progress on its atomic
program than previously believed.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Clinton administration officials have tried to play down
the significance of the CIA's new assessment, apparently eager to
avoid damaging efforts toward rapprochement with Iran's new
reformist leader, President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   One view held by some Clinton administration officials is that
the new assessment is an attempt by CIA analysts to avoid criticism
in the future for failing to warn policy-makers if Iran someday
joins the ranks of states with nuclear weapons. The officials
believe that the agency has been singed by criticism after previous
intelligence failures: missing signs that India was about to test a
nuclear weapon in 1998, and being surprised by the advanced state
of Iraq's nuclear program, revealed after the Persian Gulf war of
1991.
</P>
<P>
   In view of the debate over the new CIA assessment, officials are
now considering whether to order a formal National Intelligence
Estimate, which would call for all of the agencies in the
intelligence community to contribute to a government-wide appraisal
of Tehran's nuclear capacity.
</P>
<P>
   The latest CIA assessment implicitly acknowledges what many
American officials say is a severe problem for the United States:
the shortcomings of intelligence about both the Iranian program and
the spread on the black market of weapons-grade fissile material
from the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, CIA analysts are warning that, given Iran's intensive
efforts to steal or buy highly enriched uranium and plutonium, it
is possible that it may have more bomb-grade material than
previously believed.
</P>
<P>
   The scientific and technical know-how to build a bomb is useless
without sufficient quantities of highly enriched uranium or
plutonium, the ``fissile material'' at the heart of an atomic
weapon.
</P>
<P>
   It has proved extraordinarily difficult for countries like Iran
and Iraq to generate enough material to make a bomb on their own.
Western analysts say that the most likely sources are the
stockpiles of Russia and other countries of the former Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
   Ukraine and Kazakhstan, both of which had nuclear weapons or
related materials and technology on their territory during Soviet
times, have renounced weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Kazakhstan rebuffed efforts by Iran to buy beryllium
from a storage site that also contained more than 600 kilograms of
highly enriched uranium, enough to make dozens of nuclear bombs.
Two years later, Washington secretly flew the fuel out of the
country to prevent Iran and other would-be nuclear powers from
acquiring it.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia, still brimming with stockpiles of nuclear fuel and
weapons- related technology, has long sold sensitive nuclear and
missile technology to Iran, and assisted Tehran's civilian atomic
energy program over objections from Washington, which fears that
Iran's domestic nuclear power program is being used to develop
indigenous weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's concerns that Russia might be
broadening its nuclear trade with Iran to include heavy water and
graphite technology led the United States a year ago to impose
sanctions against two Russian scientific institutions.
</P>
<P>
   After the sanctions were imposed, Iran denied it was cooperating
with such institutions to develop missiles and nuclear weapons.
Last March, Yevgeny Adamov, Russia's atomic energy industry
minister, said Russia would continue its commercial nuclear
cooperation with Iran, especially its program to help Iran complete
two large reactors at Bushehr, one of which was damaged in the
Iran-Iraq war.
</P>
<P>
   Just last Friday, Russia's defense minister met with a top
Iranian security official and pledged to maintain Moscow's military
ties with Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia intends to maintain the dynamics of its bilateral ties
with Iran in the military, military-technical, scientific-technical
and energy fields,'' said Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, according
to the Interfax news service.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials have denied that Moscow is helping Iran
develop nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Iran also steadfastly denies it has a nuclear weapons program.
Since 1970, its diplomats say, it has been a member in good
standing of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which bars states
without nuclear weapons from acquiring them, and also requires that
civilian atomic facilities be inspected by international observers.
</P>
<P>
   But Iran has continued expanding its nuclear power sector even
though it is among the world's largest oil producers. Along with
uranium deposits, a uranium-ore concentration facility and two
research reactors, Iran has two nuclear research centers, including
one in the central Iranian city of Isfahan, where American analysts
believe Iran is trying to make the explosive core of an atomic
device.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Khatami was elected president in 1997, Iran replaced
the head of its atomic energy program, Reza Amrollahi, who was
widely seen as incompetent, with Gholamreza Aghazadeh, a former oil
and gas minister who is regarded as a better manager and
politically connected.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's program, however, is still viewed as deeply troubled,
American officials say.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to nuclear assistance, the United States believes
that Russian companies and other organizations have provided Tehran
with critical technology related to the development of ballistic
missiles that could carry nuclear weapons. In a national
intelligence assessment issued last year, the American intelligence
community said it believed that by 2010 Iran, using Russian
technology and assistance, might test a missile that could reach
targets in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Assessments about foreign nuclear programs have always been
highly contentious, largely because of the sensitive diplomatic and
political issues they raise. American intelligence officials knew
for years, for example, that India and Pakistan were close to
becoming nuclear powers, even as successive American
administrations chose not to acknowledge that publicly for fear of
damaging other American economic and political interests in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   The United States also has not officially acknowledged that
Israel has long had nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But the debate over Iran's nuclear program has been more about
facts than politics, with concern mounting steadily in the past
decade. With limited intelligence about the Iranian program and
Russian nuclear proliferation, the intelligence agencies have been
reluctant to draw hard conclusions about Iran's nuclear potential.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, for example, The New York Times reported that a draft
CIA report said Iran could develop a nuclear weapon by the year
2000. The next year, the agency calculated that Iran could develop
a nuclear weapon in eight to 10 years, according to a paper by W.
Seth Carus, a defense analyst at the National Defense University.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, another CIA assessment concluded that Iran was three to
five years from having a nuclear weapon, according to a
knowledgeable former American official. But the former official
criticized the analysis for relying too heavily on information from
Israeli intelligence, which has had an interest in convincing the
United States that Iran poses a strategic threat.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, widespread agreement that Iran intends to
acquire nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   David Albright, a nuclear analyst in Washington, said that Iran
would inevitably intensify efforts to acquire nuclear weapons in
response to Iraq's activities. Although it agreed this week to
permit very limited international inspections of its nuclear
facilities, Iraq, Iran's historic regional rival, has refused to
permit inspections for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iran has made it clear that it will not be the last major
country in the region to develop nuclear weapons,'' Albright said.

 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN WITH MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The British drug maker, Glaxo Wellcome, agreed Sunday
night to merge with one of its chief rivals, SmithKline Beecham,
that would create the world's largest pharmaceutical company,
executives close to the talks said.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company, to be called Glaxo SmithKline, would be a
powerhouse in Europe and the United States, with a stock-market
value of $186 billion, annual sales exceeding $25 billion and a
research and development budget of more than $3.6 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   The new company would combine Glaxo's roster of top-selling
drugs like Zantac, an ulcer drug, and treatments for AIDS and
asthma with SmithKline's consumer brands like Tums antacids and
Aquafresh toothpaste as well as its lineup of prescription drugs,
which include Paxil, a leading antidepressant, and Augmentin, an
antibiotic.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies have large and growing operations in the United
States. The combined company would be the largest seller of
prescription drugs in the United States with more than $9 billion
in prescription sales here, based on last year's results.
</P>
<P>
   A merger might result in the elimination of overlapping jobs
among the combined companies' 106,000 employees worldwide. But
Glaxo SmithKline's ambition to expand its American presence is
expected to mean that few of its nearly 22,000 jobs in the United
States would be at risk. In fact, the merged company, would
probably set up an operational headquarters in the United States,
somewhere near New York City, executives said, although the
specific location has not been chosen.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the merger, which the companies planned to announce here
on Monday morning before the opening of the London Stock Exchange,
comes amid rampant consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry.
Mergers are being driven by the increasing pressure for companies
to slash costs and bolster their drug pipelines as profit margins
continue to thin. Moreover, throughout the industry, patents for
many of the leading prescription drugs have expired or will soon,
intensifying the competition among big research laboratories to
find new drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Combined, Glaxo and SmithKline would control 7.3 percent of the
pharmaceutical industry and hope to save $1.63 billion annually by
the third year of the merger, the executives said. The two
companies would surpass the industry's current leader, Aventis,
which is based in Frankfurt and had sales of $10.8 billion last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Glaxo and SmithKline's merger was driven, in part, by
Warner-Lambert's announcement last Thursday that it was in talks
with Pfizer over a possible merger that would have made it the
largest drug maker in the world. If they do combine, Pfizer and
Warner-Lambert would rank second in the world behind a combined
Glaxo SmithKline and would be the only American pharmaceutical
company in the industry's top five.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this era of merger mania, you don't want to be the last
company without a partner,'' said Sergio Traversa, a pharmaceutical
analyst at Mehta Partners, a New York investment firm. Traversa
said Glaxo and SmithKline were a good fit because both were
themselves formed by past mergers and because many of their
London-based executives already know one another. Of all the drug
companies, Traversa said, ``this is one of the combinations that
makes the most sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives said the Glaxo and SmithKline boards voted Sunday
night to approve what they planned to call ``a merger of equals.''
Although Glaxo shareholders would control 58.75 percent of the
company, each side would send the same number of directors to the
board.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second time that Glaxo and SmithKline have tried to
merge. Nearly two years ago, the drug makers began merger
discussions, but those talks collapsed because of a bitter clash of
egos by the companies' top executives over who would control the
combined company. The deal can be consummated now, in part, because
one of the executives involved the earlier stalemate, Jan Leschly,
SmithKline's chief executive of SmithKline, is planning to retire
in April.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to the talks said Sir Richard Sykes, chairman
of Glaxo would become chairman of the combined company, and
Jean-Pierre Garnier, chief operating officer of SmithKline, would
become chief executive and run the company day to day _ probably
from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Richard, 57, is expected to retire in 2002, when Garnier,
52, would be expected succeed him, the executives said. John
Coombe, Glaxo's finance director, is to become finance director of
the new company and Tadataka Yamada of SmithKline would be be
director of research and development.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company is expected to keep its corporate
headquarters in London, but create a new operational headquarters
in the United States. An employee close to the negotiations said
that the exact location was still being worked out, but that the
American headquarters would be somewhere near New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Glaxo has its American headquarters in Research Triangle Park in
North Carolina, and SmithKline's American base is in Philadelphia.
Glaxo has 9,750 employees in America, most of them in North
Carolina. SmithKline has about 12,000 employees in the Untied
States, with 9,000 in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, SmithKline has managed much of its global
operations from Philadelphia, where both Jan Leschly, SmithKline's
chief executive officer, and Jean-Pierre Garnier, its operating
officer, live in the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Because both companies have been trying to increase their
American presence, most of the job reductions are expected to be
outside the United States. The companies expect to continue most of
their operations in North Carolina, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh,
where SmithKline has its American consumer products business, which
makes Tums, Contac cold medicine and Aquafresh toothpaste.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmaceutical analysts said Sunday that if United States jobs
were cut, they would most likely in overlapping administrative or
manufacturing operations, rather than positions in the companies'
research laboratories or sales forces.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, officials at Glaxo and SmithKline acknowledged they
were in talks, though neither company would disclose any specifics
except to say any deal would be a merger of equals. Spokesmen for
Glaxo and SmithKline declined to comment on the impending merger
Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of both companies rose last Friday in hopes the merger
would be consummated. SmithKline rose $3.9375, to $70, and Glaxo's
gained $2, to $60.
</P>
<P>
   Glaxo is being advised by Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., and SmithKline
is being advised by Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the merger had been expected since early 1998,
when the earlier talks between the companies collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hardly unexpected,'' said Dr. Joseph Zammit-Lucia,
president and chief executive of Cambridge Pharma Consultancy in
Cambridge, England. ``It's going to create a company of
considerable size. In terms of culture and direction of research
discovery, the two companies complement each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Zammit-Lucia warned that while the companies should be able
to create the cost savings promised, ``It's not such a trivial task
to manage such a big company with such a product spread.''

FAST, FIERCE AND LOVELY, THE RAMS FLY HIGH 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ The Minnesota Vikings and the St. Louis Rams offered
Sunday the equivalent of two cyclists pedaling furiously downhill,
two rafts bouncing wildly downstream, two teams that glared into
each other's eyes, took 10 paces, whirled _ and threw a maddening
stream of footballs at each other.
</P>
<P>
   All day long.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis was better equipped to throw them, catch them and run
with them. Though the Rams fell behind, 17-14, at halftime, they
rode a stunning 35-0 scoring spree in the second half that put them
ahead, 49-17, with 8 minutes 13 seconds left to play. It was a
blizzard of points, a barrage of big plays, and it left the Vikings
wobbly. The attack was so powerful and so decisive that though the
Vikings scored 20 points in the game's final eight minutes, who
cared?
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis won, 49-37, before 66,194 fans in the Trans World Dome
who enjoyed nearly all 34 Kurt Warner pass attempts, especially the
27 he Warner completed, and also saw 50 pass attempts by the
Vikings' Jeff George. The fans saw Warner throw for 391 yards to 10
different receivers and George hit five different receivers for 424
yards. Warner threw five touchdown passes, George four.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Warner who put together the game-deciding string _
scoring passes of 13, 1 and 2 yards late in the third quarter and
early in the fourth _ to push the Rams into the National Football
Conference championship game. The Rams (14-3) will play the Tampa
Bay Buccaneers (12-5) here next Sunday to decide which team will
represent the conference in Super Bowl XXXIV.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you go into the fourth quarter and a team hasn't
gotten more than 50 yards rushing and you've got the kind of points
they had means there were just too many times our guys were on the
ground slipping, falling, or too many plays that they made off
their athletic ability,'' Vikings Coach Dennis Green said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got a lot of speed and they play on a fast surface.
They use that speed well. The quarterback can throw a nice deep
ball and they've got a lot of guys that can chase it down. They've
got exceptional speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Rams receiver Isaac Bruce caught four balls for 133 yards and a
touchdown. Torry Holt grabbed six more for 65 yards. Running back
Marshall Faulk caught five passes for 80 yards, including a 41-yard
score off a screen pass. Receiver Az-Zahir Hakim caught five for 49
yards.
</P>
<P>
   Open receivers, crisp Warner passes, big plays, points aplenty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't think their defense matched up with our offense and
we really believed we could make big plays and score points,'' Rams
Coach Dick Vermeil said. ``We've got so many kids that can score
and make plays. We can get chunks of yardage.''
</P>
<P>
   That was illustrated on the Rams' first offensive play of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota started the game on offense and orchestrated a
sparkling 11-play, 60-yard drive to the Rams' 13. It stalled there,
but took 5:37 off the clock and produced a 3-0 Minnesota lead.
</P>
<P>
   No problem, the Rams said. They took the ensuing kickoff and
returned it to their 23. One play later, on a deep post pattern,
Bruce scored on a 77-yard touchdown pass from Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Thus it took the Vikings 11 plays and 5 minutes to score a field
goal and the Rams 1 play and 21 seconds to score a touchdown. On
the game's initial possessions, the order had been set.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a double post, with me and Torry both lined left,''
Bruce said of his 77-yarder. ``Their secondary had to keep track of
both of us running the same route. I caught them a little
flat-footed.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd Lyght, the Rams' Pro Bowl cornerback, said: ``A varied,
attacking scheme is the key for our offense, and the Vikings have
pretty predictable defensive sets and not a good mix on defenses.
You cannot give that to our players and our coaches. No offense
does the amount of movements and shifts across the board that we
do. It gave Minnesota some trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Vikings temporarily solved it. The long Bruce score was
followed by the long Faulk score and the Rams were ahead, 14-3,
entering the second quarter. Minnesota began stunting and blitzing
more, pressuring Warner, and forcing St. Louis turnovers. In the
second quarter Minnesota's Cris Carter caught a 22-yard touchdown
pass and Leroy Hoard scored on a 4-yard run. Minnesota left at
halftime with a 3-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   Then came a breathtaking play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to take the third-quarter kickoff to the house,'' the
Rams' Tony Horne said. ``I had just missed doing that on a couple
of kickoffs in the first half. We had set them up, running right on
the kickoff return all of the time in the first half.''
</P>
<P>
   To start the second half, therefore, Horne and the Rams started
the kickoff return running right but veered and returned the ball
to the left. A hop, a skip, a jump and blazing speed was exhibited
by Horne. It wound up a 95-yard kickoff return for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   That started the Rams' 35-point getaway.
</P>
<P>
   It began a third quarter that the Rams controlled in first downs
(10 to 0), total yards (150 to minus 2), passing yards (133 to
minus 3) and possession time (12:25 to 2:35).
</P>
<P>
   ``That was huge; it set the tempo,'' Warner said of Horne's
return. ``It got us the momentum back. The offense kind of took
over and stayed on a wave from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Vikings linebacker Dwayne Rudd said: ``We had things going our
way and Tony Horne changed it around. That was a championship play
that helped them to the championship game.''
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis rout was in gear.
</P>
<P>
   By game's end, the Rams had broken 12 team records and Warner
had broken five team passing records.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is a classic matchup of offensive firepower (St. Louis)
against defensive mettle (Tampa Bay) in the NFC championship game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, the Rams are playing well,'' Vikings linebacker
Chris Doleman said. ``I'm not saying they'll go all the way. But
I'd say their chances are very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner is confident the Rams will throw more passes, score more
points, continue to fly.
</P>
<P>
   Will this offense be stopped, he was asked?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so,'' Warner said. ``I haven't seen a defense
that has done it yet. People are going to have to prove it to me
for me to believe it.''

 &HT;    Johnson resigns from coaching Dolphins
 &HT;    By Mark Woods
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. _ The official announcement, delayed almost two
hours, finally came at 12:52 p.m. For most of Jimmy Johnson's life,
this time _ 1 p.m. on a Sunday _ meant an opening kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   On this Sunday, though, it meant a closing statement.
</P>
<P>
   One day after standing on the sideline at Jacksonville's Alltel
Stadium, watching the Miami Dolphins suffer the worst loss in
franchise history _ a 62-7 defeat in the second round of the NFL
playoffs _ Johnson stepped onto the stage in the auditorium of the
Dolphins' training facility and announced that he was doing what he
almost did one year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Ending his coaching career.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time,'' he said, ``it's final and forever.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason the news conference was delayed had nothing to do
with Johnson, 56, wavering on a decision. Dolphins owner Wayne
Huizenga was busy working out the details of a three-year, $3.9
million contract for Johnson's successor _ Dave Wannstedt.
</P>
<P>
   Wannstedt, a longtime friend of Johnson's who was hired a year
ago as an assistant head coach after being fired after six seasons
with the Chicago Bears, becomes the fourth head coach in franchise
history. Wannstedt promptly fired three assistant coaches,
including offensive coordinator Kippy Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can stand here right now and tell you that the goals of our
football team are no different than what they were in July _ and
that's reaching the Super Bowl,'' Wannstedt said.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, was the goal of Johnson when he returned to
South Florida in 1996. The coach who had guided the University of
Miami to a national title in 1987, before heading to Dallas and
winning two Super Bowls in five years, brashly talked of a
three-year plan to get the Dolphins back to the Super Bowl for the
first time since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   But in four years, he produced a 38-31 record and won two
playoff games _ each of which was followed by a record-setting
post-season loss.
</P>
<P>
   Last January, the Dolphins fell 38-3 at Denver. At the time,
that was the worst post-season loss in team history. It was topped
Saturday at Jacksonville when, in what also might have been
quarterback Dan Marino's final game, the Dolphins fell behind 24-0
in the first quarter en route to the NFL's worst loss in 23 years.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 24 hours later, shortly after meeting with Huizenga,
Johnson stood in his office and prepared for his news conference.
He seemed relaxed, as if a burden had been lifted. He smiled as he
talked about giving his fish tank to his secretary and his office
to his longtime friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't this one game,'' he said. ``I've been thinking about
this for some time.''
</P>
<P>
   He approached Huizenga and team president Eddie Jones separately
several weeks ago and gave each the same message: His dream job
wasn't a dream anymore. He was tired of coaching. He wasn't having
fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could put two and two together real quick after that,''
Huizenga said. ``We agreed that no decision would be made until
after the season. ... If we had won in Jacksonville, maybe Jimmy
would have re-thought where he was going.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson insisted that wasn't the case, that he had his mind made
up that no matter what happened _ first-round loss or Super Bowl
title _ he was ready to quit.
</P>
<P>
   This, he made it clear Sunday, was his final answer.
</P>
<P>
   He already is a millionaire. Now he needs other things. Like a
life beyond football.
</P>
<P>
   There already are at least two offers from networks to be an NFL
analyst. Johnson, however, said he likely would pass on them,
instead sticking to some consulting work for the Dolphins and lots
of time on his boat, named ``Three Rings'' for his national titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had my time in the sun,'' he said. ``I've had my time in
the spotlight. Now I want to have my time with my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Will he stick to that pledge this time?
</P>
<P>
   ``That will be interesting,'' Wannstedt said. ``We're going to
call him. We're not going to let him lay down there and gain 20
pounds down in the Keys. We're going to keep him active. He's going
to want to be involved. He loves these players and the relationship
he's got with Wayne and Eddie. He's going to be here in South
Florida. This is his home.''
</P>
<P>
   He married his longtime girlfriend, Rhonda, last summer during a
party at their house in the Keys. Several weeks ago, after Bill
Parcells resigned as coach of the New York Jets, Johnson joked
about how ``some people are strange,'' how they actually want to
spend time with their family; how they want to sleep until 8 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   He let only a few people know, but at the time he had decided he
was one of those strange people.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Rhonda stood, holding their dog, Buttercup, and watched
as Johnson gave his farewell speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the team has done some good things,'' he said. ``We
were one of three teams in the NFL that went to the playoffs the
last three years. And we advanced the last couple years. I think
we've got some good, young players on this football team. I think
we're in great shape as far as the salary cap. And even though some
may scoff at me saying this, I really don't think we're that far
away.''
</P>
<P>
   He maintained his composure until the end, when he started
thanking people, ending with words for Huizenga.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know,'' he said, his voice starting to crack, ``how
badly it makes me feel that we didn't bring a championship to
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, he turned the stage _ and the team _ over to
Wannstedt, a friend since their days as assistant coaches at the
University of Pittsburgh in the late '70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish him the best of luck,'' he said. ``I'll do whatever he
asks me to. Again, I had ... ``
</P>
<P>
   He swallowed hard as he mentioned his 35 years of coaching _
which began with a role as a defensive line coach at Louisiana Tech
in 1965 and ended on this day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had 35 great years,'' he said, giving a wave with his right
arm as he walked away from the microphone. ``Thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   Wannstedt gave Johnson a hug, then stepped to the microphone. As
Johnson, Rhonda and Buttercup headed for an exit, Wannstedt made
one last comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Jimmy,'' he said. ``Be careful on those roadblocks going
95 south now.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson smiled, glancing at his watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``High tide is at 2 o'clock,'' he said. ``I've got to get out of
here.''

   Israeli Leader Wins Fight Over Banking Nomination
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli Cabinet, over the public objections of the finance
minister, narrowly approved Prime Minister Ehud Barak's choice of a
conservative central bank economist as the bank's next governor.
</P>
<P>
   David Klein, who now heads the Bank of Israel's monetary affairs
division, was endorsed in a 10-7 vote after a long afternoon of

   An ABC spokeswoman said the network stopped trying to collect

   Promotional appearances surrounding ``Hurricane,'' the new film
exploring the life of Rubin ``Hurricane'' Carter, the boxer who was

RAMS ROAR PAST VIKINGS TO REACH NFC TITLE GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Hello world!
</P>
<P>
   Playing for the first time on national television all season,
the St. Louis Rams held their official coming-out party Sunday
before a crowd of 66,194 at the Trans World Dome.
</P>
<P>
   And in the 49-37 blasting of the Minnesota Vikings in the NFC
divisional playoffs, the Rams showed everybody what their fans
already knew.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams, who turned a 17-14 halftime deficit into a 49-17 lead
with five consecutive touchdowns to start the second half, are for
real.
</P>
<P>
   Check that.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams, led by quarterback Kurt Warner's five touchdown passes
to five receivers and a defense that limited the Vikings to a
minus-2 yards in the game-turning third quarter, are talented.
</P>
<P>
   Now everybody knows it.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that they play in a town that was playing host to its
first-ever playoff game. Or that the team, which moved to St. Louis
five years ago from Los Angeles, was in the playoffs for the first
time since 1989. Or that the Rams had not beaten an opponent with a
winning record.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much for not having playoff experience,'' Rams coach Dick
Vermeil said. ``John Wooden once told me that talent is more
important than experience. We have a lot of talent on this team. We
expected to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Rams receiver Isaac Bruce: ``We were the only game playing,
other than the AFC. I think we played somebody. They were a tough
team; they were a playoff team from last year. I think we finally
smashed that question of us not playing anybody. We set the tone
and continued to pound them.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Vikings (11-7), who were considered to be the
ultimate litmus test for a team that finished at the bottom of the
NFC West last season at 4-12, have been dispatched, the Rams (14-3)
have been installed as the favorites to duplicate Atlanta's last
place-to-the-Super Bowl journey of a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   They are one step away, playing host to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers
in the NFC Championship Game next Sunday at 3:15 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Warner displayed the form that earned him NFL MVP honors,
completing 27 of 33 passes for 391 yards, including a sizzling
18-of-21 for 197 yards and three touchdowns in the second half.
Only two quarterbacks have thrown more than five touchdowns in a
playoff game. And his 81.8 completion percentage was the third
highest in playoff history. He completed passes to 10 receivers,
led by Tory Holt's six catches for 65 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Warner Brothers, as the Rams receiver corps is called, set
the tone on their first play.
</P>
<P>
   After Minnesota opened the scoring with 31-yard field goal from
Gary Anderson, Bruce ran a post pattern and Warner hit him
perfectly for a 77-yard touchdown pass play.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Marshall Faulk caught a 41-yard touchdown pass from
Warner in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Playoff jitters seemingly got to the Rams in the second quarter
when Minnesota turned two turnovers into touchdowns to take a 17-14
lead at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   It only proved to be a brief respite before the storm. Tony
Horne opened the second half with a 95-yard kickoff return for a
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   A Faulk touchdown run and touchdown passes to tight end Jeff
Robinson, former TCU lineman Ryan Tucker and tight end Roland
Williams followed, as the Rams blew the Vikings out of the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The three fourth-quarter scores by the Vikings, including two by
receiver Randy Moss, who finished 188 yards receiving, meant
little.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry the final minutes went so long,'' Vermeil said. ``We
held you guys up and delayed cocktail hour. They kept battling.
But, the game was over.''
</P>
<P>
   Let the coronation begin.

   ARUSHA, Tanzania _ Nelson Mandela began his duties Sunday as the
new mediator for the conflict in Burundi with an extraordinary
attack on the nation's warring leaders _ seated in a long row in
front of him _ for failing their people and shaming all of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   He came here on his way to New York to brief the Security
Council on the situation in Burundi, a small nation in central
Africa, whose violent ethnic war has been declared a priority for
the United Nations. Mandela said the outside world was horrified at
the huge number of people who had died _ as many as 200,000 in a
nation of fewer than 6 million _ since the civil war began in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they hear this, they say, `Africans are still barbarians
_ no human beings could do what they are doing,''' said Mandela,
who retired last year as the first South African president elected
by South Africans of all races. He pleaded, ``Please, join the
modern world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are you lagging behind?'' he asked at another point. ``Why
do you allow yourselves to be regarded as leaders without talent,
leaders without a vision?''
</P>
<P>
   Mandela was appointed to the mediator's job last month by
regional leaders after the last mediator, Julius Nyerere, the
former president of Tanzania, died in October.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela signaled that he meant business in the search for peace
in Burundi, where ethnic Hutu, who make up 85 percent of the
population, are fighting to overthrow the minority Tutsi, who run
the government and army.
</P>
<P>
   The war in Burundi is particularly ominous to the outside world
because it shares the same explosive ethnic split that led to the
killings of at least 500,000 Tutsi in neighboring Rwanda in 1994,
and Burundi has its own history of big ethnic massacres.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela began his job at a tense time. The government has forced
about 350,000 Hutu to leave their homes and to move into more than
50 camps to keep them from giving support to guerrilla fighters
following a series of rebel attacks last summer near the capital,
Bujumbura. Foreign governments and human-rights groups have
criticized the camps as dirty, disease-ridden breeding grounds for
more violence.
</P>
<P>
   In the last month, 30,000 refugees have poured into camps across
the border in Tanzania to escape fighting in the nation's
southeast.
</P>
<P>
   There was no indication at the start of the meeting Sunday that
Mandela planned so strong an assault on representatives from the 18
different parties, including the government, who gathered in this
town in northern Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed informally in a golden batik shirt, he walked into a
conference room here with a smile and slow step, asking permission
to shake hands and joking about his age. ``Some of you are very
young,'' he said to the Burundian delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela is 81, and some Burundians have sniped over whether he
is up to the task of finding peace for a small country with an
outsized war. Many have also wondered aloud if Mandela, who has
also been active in Middle East peace efforts, has time for
Burundi.
</P>
<P>
   But Mandela showed quickly he had done his homework, outlining
major points of contention with business-like precision. Those
included disarming combatants, integrating more Hutu into the army,
developing a timetable for elections and forming a transitional
government.
</P>
<P>
   He also suggested that he hoped to bring regional and even world
leaders _ including President Clinton, Jacques Chirac of France and
King Fahd of Saudi Arabia _ into the effort to find peace for
Burundi.
</P>
<P>
   He was adamant that the negotiations be expanded to include
armed rebel groups not now included in the talks because of
internal squabbles among the various opposition groups. The hope is
that this may stave off violence immediately and lead to a more
solid peace for the long term. ``There can be no guarantee that the
decision we take here _ even if unanimous _ will be respected by
the armed groups on the ground,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But near the end of his speech he began his criticism of the
Burundian leaders _ for taking too long to find peace, for not
compromising and for putting their own interests above their
nation's. Saying that they did not measure up to leaders in places
like Namibia, Mozambique or Zimbabwe, he seemed intent on shaming
them into action.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that women, children and the aged are being
slaughtered every day is an indictment against all of you,'' he
said. ``You have reached a stage where none of you is completely
right and none is completely wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The Burundian delegates applauded only tepidly at the end of the
speech, which lasted over an hour, but afterward suggested that
they were proud to be scolded by a man of such moral authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is accurate,'' said Leonce Ndarubagiye, a leading member of
a Hutu rebel group, the National Council for the Defense of
Democracy. ``There are things he said that did not please everyone.
But they are things that needed to be said.''
</P>
<P>
   Ndarubagiye also made clear how difficult the search for peace
would be, even with Mandela at the lead of the talks. Officials say
that Ndarubagiye's group once controlled many of the fighters, but
has since lost many of them in an internal leadership struggle.
Ndarubagiye said he opposed including any more groups in the talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The armed groups are represented here,'' he said. ``If there
are others, we don't know them.''
</P>
<P>
   Still the peace effort _ which had languished after Nyerere's
death _ has been given a needed jolt by Mandela. As the man who
united his own nation, one that also was ruled by a small minority,
he may be the best person to find peace for Burundi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mandela is very important because he is the symbol of a
solution without revenge,'' said Mario Marazziti, spokesman for the
Community of St. Egidio, a Catholic lay organization that is
helping mediate the conflict. ``Reconciliation is the only hope for
Burundi, and who better to preach reconciliation than Mandela.''

A CELEBRATION FOR A CARDINAL'S 80TH BIRTHDAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ From the people who turned out in tuxedos, furs and
jewels for a $1,000-a-plate fund-raising dinner Saturday night to
the ones who trekked to St. Patrick's Cathedral in subways from
neighborhoods all over the city on Sunday morning, New Yorkers
honored Cardinal John O'Connor this past weekend, as much in loving
farewell as in celebration of his 80th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Standing on the dais in the Waldorf-Astoria's grand ballroom
Saturday night, the cardinal surveyed a crowd of 1,500 of his
wealthiest and most influential supporters from church, business
and political circles, poking fun at himself and a retirement he
did not appear to welcome, but seemed to accept as inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   He promised not to ``fade into the woodwork.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I will go one day,'' he told the crowd. ``Some wonder how
soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Though it prompted laughter at the dinner, the cardinal's
retirement has fueled intense, if hushed, speculation in recent
months. Upon turning 80, cardinals lose their eligibility to vote
for the next pope, and so, after 16 years leading the Archdiocese
of New York's 2.4 million Roman Catholics, O'Connor is expected to
retire swiftly. His successor will probably be named at the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   Seated with O'Connor were most of the cardinals from the United
States, along with fellow archbishops, some of whom _ like
Archbishop Justin Rigali of St. Louis and Archbishop Edwin O'Brien,
head of the archdiocese for the military services _ have been
mentioned as possible successors.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal's presumed final months running the New York
Archdiocese have been marked by personal trials. Last summer he
underwent surgery to remove a brain tumor, followed by radiation
treatments.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall, he was briefly hospitalized for fatigue and missed
Sunday Mass for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   He is now taking medications with side effects that cause his
body and face to swell, so physically he appears far different from
the trim, forceful advocate of the church's positions that New
Yorkers have known.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor's friends said the illness, or rather the outpouring of
warmth that it prompted, had changed the man profoundly, bringing
out a softer side. For the first time in O'Connor's life, people
stopped to think about him, and to show their appreciation, said
Auxiliary Bishop Patrick Ahearn of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never got that before, and I see he likes it,'' Ahearn
said. ``It's in his eyes. It's in his smile. He's delighted.''
</P>
<P>
   Others suggested that it was not so much the cardinal who had
been changed by illness, but rather those around him, who had been
reminded of his mortality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's made us more attentive to what he's tried to
do,'' said Timothy Rooney, the president of Yonkers Raceway Corp.
and an owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Dolan, the chairman of Cablevision Systems Corp.,
agreed. ``Before, we just didn't see him,'' Dolan said. ``His
illness has helped us to see him better.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After a series of tributes, including a videotape of his life
prepared by Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., O'Connor told his followers that
New York was a complex city, where poverty could take many forms,
spiritual and physical, and the rich could prove saintly through
works of charity.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking without notes, he urged his admirers to continue their
``quiet works of mercy'' after he stepped down, and joked that he
was not at all ready to surrender the ``fancy digs'' he enjoys
behind St. Patrick's Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will soon be evicted,'' he said. ``I will have the
distinction of being the first living cardinal who will be thrown
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will try to pretend I enjoy it,'' he continued. ``I will try
to pretend I'm happy to be relieved of the responsibilities. I
won't enjoy it. I won't be happy to be relieved of the
responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   The evening raised $5.2 million for a new Cardinal's Legacy
Fund, which will finance educational and social programs, as well
as endow a chair in Hebrew Studies at St. Joseph's Seminary in
Yonkers.
</P>
<P>
   The celebrations continued Sunday morning at St. Patrick's
Cathedral with a tribute to O'Connor from the papal nuncio to the
United States, Archbishop Gabriel Montalvo. ``Even now, in this
time of infirmity, your eminence continues to teach us all by
example,'' Montalvo said.
</P>
<P>
   After Mass, the vast doors to the cathedral were opened, letting
in the crisp winter breeze as 3,000 worshippers sang ``Happy
Birthday'' to the cardinal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a once-in-a-lifetime thing to see,'' said Teresa
Schiraldi, 71, who had taken the subway and the bus from Queens to
attend Mass. She said the cardinal's dramatic final months as
archbishop had made her more aware of her own blessings.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Kavulich, 62, had come in from Scranton, Pa., where
O'Connor had served as bishop for 10 months before coming to New
York. ``It's the first time I sang `Happy Birthday' in church,''
Kavulich said with a laugh. ``He's up and working, and he's been
ill for the past year. He's an inspiration to the church.''

STRANGE, BUT TRUE, TITANS' RUN CONTINUES
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Quarterback Peyton Manning was frustrated, and
probably a little sore. It was the third quarter, and his
Indianapolis Colts trailed the Tennessee Titans by 4 points.
Manning and one of the best offenses in football had been limited
to three field goals, dumbfounded by an aggressive and smart Titans
defense.
</P>
<P>
   When Manning's upper body was slammed into the turf on a pass
play by the 270-pound defensive lineman Kenny Holmes, the entire
crowd at the RCA Dome held its breath. Manning was not seriously
hurt, but he was angry, pounding his fist on the ground in
frustration, then getting up quickly to have a few words with a
wide receiver who had run an errant route.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrating. Dizzying. But true. The favored Colts, playing
before a rabid home crowd, were beaten Sunday by the Tennessee
Titans, 19-16, in an American Football Conference playoff game. The
Colts were outcoached, outhustled and outmuscled by a team that has
a whisper of destiny about it.
</P>
<P>
   Riding a dominating third quarter by the power back Eddie
George, who had a 68-yard primal run up the gut of the defense for
a touchdown and 162 yards over all, the Titans advanced to the AFC
championship game at Jacksonville next Sunday with their sixth
consecutive victory.
</P>
<P>
   The game sets up an intriguing matchup. The Jaguars' only two
losses this season were to Tennessee (15-3).
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Colts will wonder why they played so sloppily and
with such little passion. Coach Jim Mora, who guided his team to a
13-3 regular-season record, still has not won a playoff game in
five attempts going back to his days as the coach of the New
Orleans Saints. Indianapolis players dropped passes, and the Colts'
key players _ Manning, running back Edgerrin James and wide
receiver Marvin Harrison _ were never a factor.
</P>
<P>
   George was. He broke open the game when the Colts were leading
by 9-6 in the third quarter. When linebacker Michael Barber blitzed
up the middle, thinking it was a pass play, a huge hole was left
for George to squeeze his large frame through. He showed why he is
so dangerous, because his bulk is accompanied by a lot of speed. He
was untouched, and the Titans took the lead for good on his
touchdown at 13-9.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee added an Al Del Greco field goal of 25 yards early in
the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed that the Colts were back in the game when Terrence
Wilkins took a punt return down to the Titans' 3-yard line. But
replays showed that he had stepped out of bounds at the Colts' 33;
Coach Jeff Fisher challenged the initial call, and the return was
correctly called back.
</P>
<P>
   The Colts did not score on that drive and Del Greco added
another field goal, this one from 43 yards with less than five
minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   The only mistake George made was a fumble late in the game that
was recovered by the Colts, who later scored on a 15-yard run by
Manning with less than two minutes to play. The ensuing onside kick
by Indianapolis was unsuccessful as Tennessee wide receiver Yancey
Thigpen grabbed the ball. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Manning completed 19 of 43 passes for 227 yards. Harrison, who
had 115 catches in the regular season, had only five Sunday for 65
yards. James was held to 56 yards on 20 carries and one catch for 8
yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans may have been lucky to be playing the Colts, but here
they were, thanks to a certain trick play at the end of their
playoff game against Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Titans' coaches and veteran players were concerned
that the team remained too giddy about that last-second touchdown
in Nashville _ a kickoff return off a lateral thrown across the
field, now known as the Music City Miracle _ constantly discussing
it with friends and reporters, basking in the play's dramatic glow.
The danger for Tennessee was that the team was not focusing on the
Colts.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Titans awoke from their dream state, it did not take
them long to figure out the task ahead. Indianapolis is difficult
to stop because of the three-headed monster of Manning, James and
Harrison. Load up the line of scrimmage to try to stop James, and
the Manning-to-Harrison combination can incinerate you. Spend an
inordinate amount of resources on flooding the secondary with extra
bodies to stop Manning and Harrison, and James will light up the
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee does possess a formidable weapon in Fisher's brilliant
defensive mind. Fisher has devised schemes to stop the vaunted
offense of the Jacksonville Jaguars, and coming into this game he
viewed James as the Colts' biggest threat, mainly because once
James gets going, it opens up the Colts' deadly play-action passing
game.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans began playing eight men near the line of scrimmage,
slowing James, and simultaneously clogging the middle passing lanes
because the Colts' receivers run a lot of short crossing routes.
The Titans' scheme had early success. Every time James approached
the line of scrimmage, he was met by a wall of Tennessee defenders.
Confident in his secondary, Fisher called for a lot of single
coverage on Colts' wide receivers, something few teams have tried
this year, but for Tennessee it worked well.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher's influence was also seen in the Titans' blitzing
schemes. On a first-down play in the second quarter, Manning was
forced to use a timeout when several Colts seemed confused by
Tennessee's pre-snap look. Tennessee's great defensive play led to
the Colts looking out of sync, and even sluggish, at times.
</P>
<P>
   All Indianapolis could manage in the first half were three field
goals by Mike Vanderjagt, two from 40 yards and one from 34.
Tennessee, using a conservative game plan that called for a healthy
dose of George, had two Del Greco field goals in the half, from 49
and 37 yards. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 9-6 halftime score was in stark contrast to some of the
other explosive divisional playoff games this weekend. The first
half also showed this was not going to be easy for Indianapolis.

SPIRITED DEBATE OVER CONSPIRACY VERDICT AS NATION CELEBRATES KING
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Tenn., Ga., N.C., D.C., N.Y.)   (jw) 
 By LYNDA RICHARDSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At Martin Luther King Jr. High School in Manhattan, students are
more than well versed in the life and death of their school's
namesake. So when a jury in Memphis decided last month that King
was not the victim of a gunman acting alone, but was instead the
victim of a far-reaching conspiracy that included the U.S.
government, it made for spirited debate in James O'Brien's law and
justice classes.
</P>
<P>
   Some of O'Brien's students wasted no time in declaring that they
had suspected a conspiracy all along. Others said they were
unwilling to exonerate James Earl Ray as the gunman, unconvinced by
the jury's verdict in the wrongful-death case brought by King's
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had lively debates in class,'' O'Brien said. ``This was
a fascinating turn of history that we could get kids involved in.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the nation, hundreds of commemorations are planned Monday
to honor the life and legacy of King, as they are every year. But
this year's national holiday, marking what would have been King's
71st birthday, comes just weeks after the controversial verdict was
delivered.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, people invested in King celebrations, teaching and
scholarship have found themselves reconciling the verdict with
their own views about what happened, sometimes in discomfiting
ways.
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part, in the days leading up to Monday's
holiday, a time filled with assemblies and spirited recitals of
King's well-known speeches, a prevailing view has been that there
are greater truths in King's legacy than in the lingering
speculation over who killed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The focus is primarily on Dr. King's life,'' said O'Brien, a
part-time lawyer who seized the recent verdict as a current events
topic for his students. ``There's a sense of obligation that each
person has to continue on and to make the world better for
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   At Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, where King preached his
gospel of nonviolence, the Rev. Joseph Roberts Jr. said the verdict
confirmed what he had always suspected: that King's assassination
was a conspiracy. But the minister said he saw no need to raise
that issue during Monday's celebration, which is scheduled to
include Vice President Al Gore. ``I agree with the family that it
is time to move on,'' Roberts said. ``I got a big Bible to dwell
upon.''
</P>
<P>
   King's widow and children have long questioned Ray's 1969
conviction, and hoped that their civil suit would change the legal
and historical record of the assassination. And on Dec. 8, a
Memphis jury seemed to give them what they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   The jury declared that Loyd Jowers, 73, a retired Memphis
restaurant owner, was liable in King's death for purportedly hiring
a Memphis police officer, now dead, to kill King. The jury also
found that unnamed others, including government agencies, had been
involved, in effect accepting the King family's contention that Ray
was innocent, despite his guilty plea. Jowers, through his lawyer,
has said he participated in a conspiracy but did not know it was a
plot to kill King. The jury awarded the King family members the
damages they had sought: $100, which they say they will donate to
charity.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, we know now what happened,'' Dexter Scott King, the
youngest son of King and his wife, Coretta Scott King, told CNN in
an emotional interview shortly after the verdict. ``And for us,
this is a final chapter. This is all we asked for, was a jury of 12
independent people, ordinary people, would hear the evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   But the verdict followed an unusual four-week trial that was
notable for the passivity of the defense, the prevalence of
secondhand and thirdhand accounts and the propensity of the judge
and jurors to nod off during testimony. In an unlikely alliance,
the King family was represented by William F. Pepper, who had been
Ray's lawyer. Without facing a jury, Ray pleaded guilty in 1969 to
killing King, but later recanted. He died of liver disease in
prison in 1998 while serving a 99-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
   To some observers of the King holiday, the Memphis jury's
verdict was no thunderbolt. It did nothing more than reaffirm
long-held beliefs in a conspiracy. For others, the decision was an
irrelevant distraction, an unhelpful bit of hysteria that should
not be inflamed.
</P>
<P>
   And a great many people have reached their own verdict: that the
King holiday is not the time to dwell on such a thing.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, a spokesman for the Martin Luther King Jr. Center
for Nonviolent Social Change said the center's staff members were
rushing to put the entire testimony from the trial on the center's
Web site by month's end. But the spokesman said he was unaware of
any specific plans for the King family to address the verdict.
Throughout Atlanta, there are plans for concerts, dinners, parades
and public service projects sponsored by the King Center as well as
by colleges and schools.
</P>
<P>
   In Memphis, at the National Civil Rights Museum in the old
Lorraine Motel, where King was shot on April 4, 1968, the script
for the tour guides who will shepherd crowds Monday is to be
changed to make note of the recent court case, said Beverly
Robertson, the museum's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will probably tack on the fact that the recent court
findings suggested that there might have been someone else
involved,'' Ms. Robertson said. ``That's all we're going to say at
this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Julian Bond, chairman of the NAACP and a longtime civil rights
advocate and historian, said he hoped that people would use the
holiday to do something that King might have wanted them to do. In
his view, the trial in Memphis was so flawed that the verdict did
not deserve notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a comedy, ridiculous,'' he said. ``I don't think it
enlarged in any way our understanding of Dr. King's death or of Dr.
King himself. We're a conspiratorious country, and with these big
assassinations, King and Kennedy, it is hard for us to think that
one insignificant person could have brought down these mythic
figures, but that's what happened in this case.''

</P>
<P>
   Taylor Branch, a Pulitzer Prize-winning author who has
chronicled King's life in ``Parting the Waters'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster,
1988) and ``Pillar of Fire'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1998), the first
two volumes of a planned trilogy, said he had not once referred to
the verdict in the many speeches about King that he had given since
the verdict. And he said he did not plan to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see it as a distraction,'' Branch said. ``There was plenty
of cynicism about the federal government even before the verdict
among black people and white people, and the verdict only adds to
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the Memphis jury was the first to hold someone
accountable for playing a role in King's assassination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever the disagreement about its conclusion, it is a formal
part of the judicial operation,'' said Russell Adams, chairman of
the Afro-American studies department at Howard University, a
historically black institution in Washington. ``This Memphis
verdict for a lot of people amounted to a formal ratification of
informal opinions which were shaped the day the man was shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams said the verdict provided a ``forlorn but satisfactory
closure'' to the question of whether a conspiracy was at work. But
in the public speeches on King that he presents, Adams said, the
verdict is unlikely to warrant more than two lines. He, for one,
sees a measure of hope in the state of race relations and in the
progress that African-Americans have made through the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a higher standard of deciding what is bad,'' he said.
``Our standards have gone up in terms of what has been done and
what is expected. It doesn't mean I'm happy. I'm not.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Lischer, a professor of divinity at Duke University,
said that if the question of who killed King could be resolved
definitively, Americans could concentrate fully on his message.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as there is the accusation of a massive
government-sponsored conspiracy, we will never get beyond this
climate of distrust in this country,'' said Lischer, author of
``The Preacher King'' (Oxford University Press, 1995).

TITANS END DROUGHT
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ The Tennessee Titans yesterday were able to do
for their 77-year-old owner of 40 seasons, Bud Adams, what the
Houston/Tennesee Oilers hadn't been able to do since 1979.
</P>
<P>
   They're now in the AFC Championship Game against the
Jacksonville Jaguars Sunday, following a 19-16 victory against the
Indianapolis Colts at the RCA Dome. The Colts were favored by 5 1/2
points.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Adams was asked how this one ranked in all-time
franchise victories?
</P>
<P>
   ``At my age, it ranks No. 1,'' said Adams, who turned 77 on
earlier this month. ``If we're going to go to the Super Bowl, I'd
rather not go in a wheelchair.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee will be an underdog, just as they were a 5 1/2-point
underdog yesterday against the Colts. These Titans, if they're
anything, are resourceful.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, they used four field goals from 38-year-old Al Del
Greco, including what proved to be the game-winner from 43 yards
out in the final 4:19, along with a defense that kept the NFL's No.
4-ranked offense out of the end zone until the final 1:51 of the
game, to defeat the Colts.
</P>
<P>
   Eight days earlier, the Titans produced one of the wildest
endings in NFL playoff history _ scoring on a 75-yard kickoff
return which included a handoff and a lateral _ to defeat the
Buffalo Bills, 22-16.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's game ball for Tennessee didn't go to running back
Eddie George, who rushed for 162 yards, including a game-turning,
68-yard touchdown run up the middle in the first two minutes of the
second half, as the Colts were caught in a blitz.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's game ball for Tennessee didn't go to Del Greco. Or
to Adams. Or to coach Jeff Fisher, whose instant-replay challenge
of what appeared to be an 87-yard punt return to the Tennessee 5 by
Terrence Wilkins with 11 1/2 minutes left in the game was reviewed
and brought back 61 yards to the Colts 34 because Wilkins stepped
out of bounds in front of the Titans' bench.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's game ball instead for Tennessee went to 39-year-old
left guard Bruce Matthews, in his 17th but not necessarily his last
season for the same team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bruce Matthews got the game ball,'' said an emotionally
charged Fisher, ``because he has been with this team forever (1983)
and has never before gotten to the conference championship game.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, Matthews is in it now, along with Adams, Del Greco, Eddie
George and Jevon Kearse. The latter was in kindergarten in 1979
when the Oilers lost on a controversial call in the AFC
championship game at Pittsburgh. The so-called ``Mike Renfro Game''
was the model that the NFL used in deciding that instant replay was
needed in the game to reverse bad calls made on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Adams' franchise isn't without its storied past of hard knocks
and battle scars.
</P>
<P>
   And now to get to what would be its first Super Bowl, the Titans
are being asked to defeat a Jacksonville team that scored 62 points
against the Miami Dolphins on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can we beat Jacksonville three times (in the same season)?''
Titans' offensive tackle Brad Hopkins asked incredulously. ``What
do you expect me to say? `Oooh, Jacksonville ... 62-7 ... no, man,
I don't think we can.' Of course, I think we can win. People have
tabbed us `mediocre' and `average' all season long.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams' vagabond team has had four different home fields in the
past four season: Astrodome (Houston), Liberty Bowl (Memphis) and
Vanderbilt Stadium (Nashville) before moving this season into its
new downtown stadium in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we've needed is a chance ... (and) good fans,'' said
Hopkins. ``Playing out of somebody's garage every year didn't give
us any advantages.''
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, they took advantage of an Indianapolis defense that
ranked 18th in the NFL against the run. Somebody should have seen
it coming, as the Colts were ripped by the run in their final two
regular-season games against lowly Cleveland and Buffalo, barely
defeating the Browns (29-28) and losing to the Bills (31-6).
</P>
<P>
   Peyton Manning threw for 227 of the Colts' 305 yards of total
offense, but the only time they could get it into the end zone was
on a 15-yard scramble by Manning with 1:51 to play. The ensuing
onside kick was not successful.
</P>
<P>
   So the Titans are now four quarters away from their first Super
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   And their 77-year-old owner would like to get there while he's
still walking under his own power.

SPORTS COLUMN: SEASON TURNS ON THE WIDTH OF A SHOE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Terrence Wilkins thinks his foot width is EE, and
polite as he was after the game Sunday, he was not about to take
off his suede civilian shoes to peek inside.
</P>
<P>
   If his right foot were one size slimmer, he might not have
nicked the boundary between green field and white sideline, and the
Indianapolis Colts might still be open for business.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Wilkins' acrobatic 87-yard punt return early in the
fourth period was downgraded, via the glory of instant electronic
replay.
</P>
<P>
   As a direct consequence of the videotape, the wild-card
Tennessee Titans won this playoff game, 19-16, to move into the
American Football Conference championship game next week.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if Wilkins' foot were less wide, he might not have
had the marvelous balance to keep himself propelled forward at
sprinter speed, eluding much bigger men trying to slam him all the
way to Fort Wayne.
</P>
<P>
   The Colts were down by only a touchdown, and they might have
been only three yards from a tying touchdown, if only instant
replay did not exist.
</P>
<P>
   However, the rookie from the University of Virginia had skirted
the line on the Tennessee side of the field, which was even worse
for the Colts because in his wake he left witnesses from the
visiting team, large men who pointed large forefingers at the scene
of the alleged perpetration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was I out?'' Wilkins asked after the game, saying he never had
a good view of the play on the giant screen in the dome.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody from the Colts argued.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our coaches felt it was a legitimate decision,'' said Jim
Mora, the head coach. ``He stepped out of bounds, and when you do,
it gets called back.''
</P>
<P>
   That is true, but in the dark ages, when there was no instant
replay, the fallible mortals in zebra costumes could not be peering
down at every potential fumble, every sideline scamper.
</P>
<P>
   A play like this is why the National Football League has
returned to the device of instant replay, and why the league must
keep it in perpetuity.
</P>
<P>
   A recent league poll on the Internet produced an 88-12 response
that the instant replay should be retained. Of course, the margin
would have easily been reversed by the sad and angry patrons who
wore blue and white for the first home playoff game ever played in
this town since the Irsays slipped out of Baltimore in 1984 under
cover of darkness.
</P>
<P>
   After Coach Jeff Fisher of Tennessee made his official request
for a replay, Referee Johnny Grier stuck his head in a box on the
sideline and peered into the official league replay, and could see
what millions and millions of people already knew in comfortable
dens and smoky bars all over this football-loving country: Wilkins
had clipped the sideline at least once with the outside of his
right shoe.
</P>
<P>
   The fans booed, but if you stuck truth serum in them, they would
admit they were booing fate rather than booing the system or the
judgment of the referee. Justice prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   By this most narrow margin, the playoffs turned. Instead of
being within a few yards of a tying touchdown, the Colts began in
normal territory downfield _ the Titans' 33-yard line _ and on
Sunday afternoon young Peyton Manning was not about to pull off a
miracle.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Manning was asked if the reversal by instant replay had
affected the Colts' momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try not to let it,'' said Manning, about the most mature
second-year player anybody will ever encounter. ``What I do is, I
expect the worst. We still had good field position, but we couldn't
make any long drives.''
</P>
<P>
   This sudden reversal of fortune has happened before for the
Titans _ last week, to be precise. They stunned Buffalo with a
75-yard touchdown on a sandlot lateral play on their own kickoff
return.
</P>
<P>
   Although technically a wild-card team, the Titans had 13
victories in 16 games, and have now won two more. They are the only
survivors from the first round of playoffs a week ago, the cash-cow
wild-card round.
</P>
<P>
   The first three games of the long weekend only confirmed
suspicion that the first week of the playoffs is essentially a
space filler, however sporadically interesting.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami Dolphins, who beat Seattle last week, resigned from
football on Saturday one day before their coach. They lost, 62-7,
to Jacksonville, and Sunday it was Jimmy Johnson's turn to retire.
Johnson, who more and more has begun to resemble Boris Yeltsin in
facial expression, can now retire to his South Florida dacha and
never ever think about his last game.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, which drubbed Detroit last week, looked inept in
losing to Tampa Bay, 14-13, on Saturday, losing when long snapper
botched the exchange for what might have been a game-winning field
goal.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the early game Sunday, with St. Louis
winning, &QC; 49-37, after Minnesota made it appear close in garbage
time.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, Tennesse then went out and won one for all the
wild-card, dark-horse, long-shot types in the world. Except the
Titans won't go for that characterization.
</P>
<P>
   Now the question is whether that extra week of football, all the
pounding and the preparing, will sustain the Titans as they travel
to Jacksonville next Sunday for the conference championship game.
They have the momentum of crazy laterals and instant-replay
success. This is not your average wild-card team.

A HOPE FOR KING DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DANIEL GONZALEZ  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a lingering hurt in Chandler more than two years after
the notorious July 1997 ``roundup'' of illegal immigrants by
Chandler police and federal immigration agents.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to complaints about illegal immigrants disturb ing
the peace, officers stopped hundreds of brown-skinned peo ple _
including U.S.-born His panics and legal immigrants _ and asked
them to prove their citizenship, an action that dam aged relations
between the His panic community and city leaders.
</P>
<P>
   To help still the waters, Mayor Jay Tibshraeny reactivated the
Chandler Human Relations Com mission and appointed 11 resi dents to
serve on the multiethnic panel.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the commission launches its most ambitious at tempt
at restoring unity: a series of events honoring the Rev. Mar tin
Luther Jr. and the civil rights movement he led.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time Chandler has officially organized a
Martin Luther King event. The highlight of the week is a
$50-a-plate dinner Thursday at the Sheraton San Marcos in Chandler,
featur ing the Rev. Jesse Jackson as keynote speaker.
</P>
<P>
   As suburban populations be come more diverse, a growing number
of municipalities in the Phoenix area are forming human rela tions
commissions. The commis sions are intended to help protect civil
rights by offering citizens a forum for voicing concerns and
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Don Logan, who heads Scotts dale's Diversity and Dialog Of fice,
will recommend creating a human relations commission in Scottsdale.
Mesa and Tempe cre ated similar commissions re cently.
</P>
<P>
   Logan, who lives in Chandler, volunteered to serve on the Chan
dler commission to gain expe rience in forming the Scottsdale
commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The community needs to know that government is in tune with
its needs and is receptive to their feedback,'' Logan said.
</P>
<P>
   Logan is hopeful the Martin Luther King event this week will
help inspire the healing that still hasn't taken place in Chandler,
where one in five residents is Hispanic. Jackson, a former pres
idential candidate, has been a leader of the civil-rights move ment
since the 1960s and was an assistant to King.
</P>
<P>
   But the roundup remains a divisive issue. It spawned two
civil-rights lawsuits. The city paid out $400,000 to settle one;
the other is pending.
</P>
<P>
   For 32 years, Chandler Human Relations Commissioner Sylvia
Encinas watched as Chandler changed from a sleepy farming town
rimmed by cotton fields and grazing sheep into a sprawling
high-tech manufacturing city of 175,000 known for big-name em
ployers like Intel and Motorola.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the growth, the city retains an air of friendliness that
kept Encinas and her husband, Albert, rooted to the same house.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very, very good city to live in,'' Encinas said.
</P>
<P>
   But Encinas and some other commissioners say it will take more
than a few Martin Luther King events and a speech by Jackson to
erase the hard feel ings still festering 2{ years after the
roundup.
</P>
<P>
   They say the mayor, the police chief and the city manager should
be taking bold steps to reach out to the Hispanic com munity,
beginning with public apologies delivered in person at neighborhood
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can do hundreds of events. But if they don't sit down with
them and take out their hurt, nothing is going to change, and they
are hurting,'' Encinas said during a testy meeting Mon day at the
Trinity Christian Fel lowship Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for the leadership to get involved _ past time,''
said Dennis Flaherty, another com mission member.
</P>
<P>
   Others on the commission, in cluding Chairman Kevin Hartke,
pastor of Trinity Christian Fel lowship Church, feel the mayor has
apologized enough for the roundup.
</P>
<P>
   ``If satisfaction was as simple as `I'm sorry,' well, that was
offered, and it wasn't satisfac tory,'' Hartke said.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, however, will meet with the mayor and other city
leaders in February and ask them to do more to reach out to the
Hispanic community.
</P>
<P>
   Tibshraeny said he has already apologized to the Hispanic com
munity and doesn't see any rea son to do it again. The apology was
recorded on videotape shortly after the roundup when Hispanics
jammed a City Council meeting to complain, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think an apology is an apology,'' he said. ``It stands
forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Tibshraeny said he has met with members of the Hispanic
community individually and in groups numerous times since the
roundup and has offered to meet them at any time.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Tibshraeny pointed out, he voted against a $238,700
monument because some people said it slighted contributions by
Hispanics. The monument will include a life-size statue of re
nowned architect Frank Lloyd Wright, a friend of city founder A.J.
Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just one example where on a specific issue I've worked
with the community,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said he also partici pated in Spanish classes offerred
to city employees and pushed for hiring more bilingual employees.
</P>
<P>
   While both Tibshraeny and City Manager Lloyd Harrell ac
knowledged that some members of the Hispanic community re main
unsatisfied, they dismissed them as a vocal minority.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is a small group, I think, that is still complaining
about this, and that's fine,'' Tib shraeny said. ``You're never go
ing to get 100 percent agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Harrell: ``I would charac terize them as a small, very
active group of folks who con tinue to raise objections to every
city action. I don't know if they will ever be satisfied. I hope
that they will be, but that remains to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides reactivating the Hu man Relations Commission, the city
appointed a police officer to serve as a liaison between the
Hispanic community and the Po lice Department, Harrell said. The
city also instituted a Citizens Police Academy for Spanish-speaking
residents that exposes citizens to all operations of the Police
Department, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Harrell said city officials are hamstrung by the pending law
suit from speaking too openly about the roundup.
</P>
<P>
   But Flaherty said the lawsuit shouldn't keep city leaders from
reaching out to Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor and council are public servants,'' he said. ``I just
don't believe that the only ap proach is to say nothing. There has
got to be another answer.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission, meanwhile, has made progress on several fronts,
he said, like beefing up diversity training for all city employees.
</P>
<P>
   Encinas said the kind of trust-building required to move for
ward still hasn't taken place. She said many in the Hispanic com
munity remain distrustful of city leaders, especially the police.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are supposed to be someone you can go to with a problem.
I've heard people say, `If I need a police officer, I'm not going
to call them,' and that's scary,'' said Encinas, who is ac tive in
her neighborhood church _ St. Mary's _ and who has worked as a
clerk for more than 20 years at Hartford Elementary School.
</P>
<P>
   For many in the Hispanic com munity, the roundup brought back
memories of discrimination in the 1940s, when Hispanic workers
labored in the cotton fields outside Chandler, Encinas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want this to be settled once and for all. I believe that if
they did (reach out) the people would back off from the second law
suit,'' she said. ``The mayor, city manager and the chief of police
need to get together with the neighborhoods and say, `We want to be
your friends. Where can we start?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Jose Garcia agrees. Garcia, a retired Mesa police officer who
owns a video store downtown, was one of the Chandler resi dents who
filed the initial $35 million lawsuit against the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Hispanic commu nity as a whole is still hurting,''
Garcia said. ``They are still very suspicious. They are not very
trusting of the police depart ment.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler artist M.R. Diaz said his father was one of those
questioned by police during the roundup. A police officer stopped
him as he was backing out of his driveway one morning on the way to
work. In the aftermath, Diaz created a painting depicting
baton-wielding police officers getting ready to go after illegal
immigrants. A comic strip-like caption over the painting reads,
``Time for a roundup, boys.''
</P>
<P>
   But Diaz says something good came out of the roundup. It brought
the Hispanic community closer together, he said. Since the roundup,
two Cinco de Mayo festivals at A.J. Chandler Park and a mariachi
conference at the Chandler Center for the Arts have been organized
by the Chan dler Coalition for Civil and Hu man Rights. The group
was formed in response to the roundup.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the roundup, we sort of banded together,'' Diaz said.
``When I go to the mariachi festival I see my neighbors. Be fore
that, no one ever got out.''
</P>
<P>
   At the mariachi conference, however, Encinas couldn't help
noticing that the mayor wasn't there. Tibshraeny said he had a
family obligation that day.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had been the mayor, I would have been there from morning
till night,'' Encinas said. &QL;

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WATERLOO, Iowa _ Bill Bradley, who has made an appeal for racial
unity one of the pillars of his campaign for the Democratic
presidential nomination, said here Sunday at a birthday
commemoration for the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. that the job
the assassinated civil rights leader began almost half a century
ago was far from finished, but that strong leadership from the
White House would help bring it to a speedy conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for votes in one of the few places in Iowa with a
significant black population _ 6 percent _ the former New Jersey
senator declared that the ``silence of good people,'' one of King's
favorite phrases, was often the reason for inaction on crucial
issues and that should Iowans help him become president, he would
speak up, loud and clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I am trying to do in my campaign,'' Bradley said during a
reception that preceded a commemorative dinner, ``is make good
people come forward and join us so that our voices can be heard. If
you believe you are your brother's keeper, you have to walk the
talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's remarks were received with applause, and many blacks
in the audience had good words for him, aware that he has been a
strong proponent of racial causes going back to the days when he
played professional basketball, a sport heavily dominated by black
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's speaking up, walking the talk,'' said the Rev. John Ford,
associate minister of Corinthian Baptist Church, whose congregation
is mostly black.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to competing with Vice President Al Gore for
black votes in Iowa's caucuses on Jan. 24, or winning black votes
in any state, for that matter, Bradley nevertheless faces a tough
task.
</P>
<P>
   In most national polls, Gore wins the approval of at least 2 of
every 3 black voters. He also has picked up the endorsement of a
good many of the nation's top black leaders and organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Many blacks say they genuinely like and admire Bradley. But they
are quick to add that when it comes to voting, they plan to stick
with the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Bill Bradley is a good man and all that,'' said
Reginald Haywood, a department store salesman. ``But I like Al Gore
better. I've been with him for almost eight years as vice president
and he and Bill Clinton have made good on promises, on things
important to me. So I'm sticking with him now. You don't change
horses when the journey is going well.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Black allegiance to Gore can be traced in part to President
Clinton's great popularity with blacks. But over the past seven
years, Gore himself also has spent much time addressing black
concerns, frequently going into heavily black areas to campaign for
black candidates or to unveil Clinton administration programs
designed to improve things that worry blacks most, such as job
opportunities, schools, health care and housing.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday before he heads for Des Moines, for example, where he
and Bradley are scheduled to debate racial issues, Gore will
deliver remarks in Atlanta in honor of King at one of black
America's most hallowed shrines, Ebenezer Baptist Church. The
church is where King preached and is buried.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is scheduled to spend the early part of Monday attending
a King ceremony in Des Moines and then leading a discussion about
race at Drake University.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gore sent a surrogate, Lynn Cutler, a former Democratic
Committeewoman who hails from Waterloo but now is a White House
aide, to speak for him at Sunday's dinner.
</P>
<P>
   She told the dinner crowd of about 1,000 people that she had
only a brief but pointed message to deliver. ''My two bosses,'' she
said, ``get up every morning and then they work very hard on
programs to help you.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley closed his remarks Sunday by speculating on what King
might think should he suddenly find himself in Waterloo at the
start of a new American century. Would he find progress in race
relations? ``Yes,'' Bradley began, answering his own theoretical
proposition. ``But now he would find the racism more subtle. But
equally bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Bradley continued, the issue is not whether a black
person can go into a restaurant and buy a meal. The issue, he said,
is whether a black person can obtain a loan to buy the restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is much left to do if we are to live up to the memory of
Dr. King,'' Bradley concluded. ``We have to change ourselves.''

JONES PREVAILS OVER INJURY AND TELESCO
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The site was unique, the stage at Radio City Music
Hall, but the performance by Roy Jones Jr. was familiar. By
dominating David Telesco over 12 rounds to keep his undisputed
light-heavyweight championship on Saturday night, Jones reconfirmed
that he is beyond peer in that division and must now seek
challenges in other weight classes.
</P>
<P>
   Jones (41-1) earned the unanimous decision, winning all 12
rounds on all three judges' score cards, despite fighting mainly
with his right hand. He had fractured his left wrist three weeks
ago in a motorcycle accident and had hidden that fact from New York
State Athletic Commission officials before the fight. He said he
did it because he was looking forward to fighting in the first
boxing match ever at Radio City Music Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``With me, we don't see an opponent that seems to be a great
challenge,'' Jones said. ``I have to challenge myself. Fighting
here at Radio City Music Hall was something that I refused to let
go. I would have to almost break my hand off to turn it down.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones wanted to bring down the packed house of 5,923 with a
knockout, but he couldn't send Telesco (23-3) to the canvas. He
kept feeding Telesco a steady diet of right hands, like so many
spoons of ice cream. But Jones couldn't deliver the left hook,
which would have been the cherry on top.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had two hands, one of us would have had to go to the
hospital,'' Jones said. ``Either I would have really broken it or
he was going to go out of there. I could hit him with the hook
anytime. My hook is my favorite punch. My hook is my best punch.''
</P>
<P>
   As Telesco's frustration mounted, he began trash-talking with
Jones. Jones said he started talking back to Telesco, because he
didn't want Telesco to keep up a one-sided conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was saying all kind of stuff,'' Jones said. ``Asking me if
I had ever been to prison. I said, `No, and I don't plan on going.'
That's a heck of a thing to ask me. Do I look like I want to go to
prison? What's fun in there for me? I don't plan on doing nothing
to anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Telesco, 31, of Port Chester, N.Y., spent three years in prison
in upstate New York for possession of cocaine with intent to
distribute. This was supposed to be his big chance to win a world
title, and he had hounded Jones for the chance. But when he got
Jones in the ring, Telesco could barely touch him because of Jones'
incredible speed and amazing ring skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``He expected more of himself,'' said Joe DeGuardia, Telesco's
manager. ``He's very disappointed in himself. He felt like he let
down his fans.''
</P>
<P>
   After dispatching Telesco, who was probably the strongest of the
light-heavyweight challengers Jones has faced, the question for
Jones now becomes, what next?
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever shows up; I hope it's that Dariusz Michalczewski,''
Jones said, regarding the World Boxing Organization champion from
Germany. ``I have to let my hand heal up, because I'm going to beat
him worst.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who turned 31 Sunday, believes it will take a month for
his hand to heal properly. If Jones does not meet Michalczewski or
Graciano Rocchigiani, the World Boxing Council No. 1 contender,
also of Germany, then there is a chance he could drop down from the
175-pound weight class to 169 pounds and fight Bernard Hopkins, the
International Boxing Federation middleweight champion. Jones
defeated Hopkins on a 12-round decision at 159 pounds in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   On the undercard, the heavyweight Derrick Jefferson (22-1-1)
punched himself out over the first eight rounds and was out on his
feet for the start of the ninth round. That paved the way for David
Izon (25-3) to score a victory on a technical knockout when Referee
Arthur Mercante Jr. stopped the bout at 11 seconds of the ninth
round. Jefferson was so tired in the eighth round that Izon sent
him to the canvas with a slight push.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson threw more punches in a little less than nine rounds
than Jones threw over 12 rounds in his bout. Jefferson threw 498
punches, connecting on 210, while Jones threw 494 punches and
connected on 293, according to statistics by CompuBox.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so tired that he told me he had lost all bodily
functions the round before it was stopped,'' said Lou DiBella, the
senior vice president of programming for HBO/TVKO. ``He said he
literally thought he was going to die.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson caught boxing fans' attention with a spectacular
knockout of Maurice Harris last September. He tried to repeat that
performance against Izon, but Izon's chin was much more durable
than Harris' chin. Jefferson was ahead on all the judges' score
cards when the fight was stopped.  &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: SEASON OF CONTRAST FOR GEORGE AND WARNER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo., Minn., Iowa)  (lb) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ On Sunday evening Jeff George and Kurt Warner sat in
rooms across the hall from each other. As much football as they
have played, the two quarterbacks had never gotten much closer than
this: Warner in Room 140 of the Trans World Dome, George in Room
141.
</P>
<P>
   Warner, the St. Louis Rams' 28-year-old quarterback and hero of
the season, sat on the winner's podium. His first pass of the day
was a 77-yard touchdown to Isaac Bruce. He threw 33 passes and
completed 27 for 391 yards and five touchdowns in a 49-37 rout of
the Minnesota Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   Warner showed a national audience why he is who he is:
football's Joe Hardy, a diamond in the rough who came out of
nowhere to guide the Rams to the National Football Conference
championship game.
</P>
<P>
   In one brilliant season, Warner snatched an honor that the
well-traveled George failed to approach in 10 National Football
League seasons: Warner was voted the NFL's most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know a lot about Jeff,'' Warner said. ``I just really
met him today. He's had some bad raps in some places. All I know is
that the guy has every possible gift, from a quarterback's
standpoint: great arm, mobile and smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago Warner was off the radar screen, and no one cared
who he was or where he was. On Monday morning Warner is the hero,
an overnight star everyone knows on a team that was in shambles a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Warner is a fitting hero in a Rams season that commemorates
dreams and vision. Warner is just a football player and this was
only a football game, but there is something compelling about the
rise of an underdog who forged a career from nothing, from no
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Warner was born in Burlington, Iowa, and played at Regis High
School in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, where he was all-state. At Northern
Iowa University, he didn't start until he was a fifth-year senior.
He was cut by the Green Bay Packers in 1994 and worked nights at a
grocery store, waiting for the next NFL tryouts.
</P>
<P>
   When no NFL or Canadian Football League team made him an offer,
Warner opted to play for the Iowa Barnstormers of the Arena
Football League from 1995 to 1997. He was picked up by the Rams,
who assigned him to play in NFL Europe in 1998, and then played in
one game for the Rams in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   There were no indicators that an MVP season was on the horizon.
Asked the lesson of his miracle season, Warner said as he walked to
the Rams' jubilant locker room: ``I just think that there's players
out there and you've got to find them. Some guys are going to get
the opportunity from the get-go; some guys it takes them longer,
takes them a while to get a chance. That's what happened to me.''
</P>
<P>
   In the universe of professional football, George was a comet. He
was a high school star in Indianapolis, where he led Warren Central
to state championships in 1984 and 1985 in the Hoosier Dome. He
spent a year at Purdue but left when the coach was dismissed. He
transferred to Illinois, and the seeds for discontent were sown.
Many fans never forgave him for leaving Purdue.
</P>
<P>
   He was drafted by the Indianapolis Colts in 1990 and signed a
six-year contract for $12 million. He did things only prima donnas
do. He held out. He complained about his inept offensive line. He
was booed in his own hometown.
</P>
<P>
   By the fall of 1994, George was an Atlanta Falcon; by 1996, he
had burned that bridge, too. He was suspended and cut by Atlanta
after a sideline screaming match with coach June Jones. George
spent two seasons in Oakland and was let go. He was criticized as
lacking fire and leadership, as aloof, someone who stood alone on
the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   Last April George signed a one-year contract with the Vikings
for a $400,000 base salary with incentives, but no signing bonus.
He was brought in to back up Randall Cunningham, but replaced him
in midseason.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday George and Warner met as equals. Warner's Rams won.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last four minutes of a hopeless rout, George showed
why he is who he is. Showed why so many coaches from so many teams
_ Purdue, Illinois, the Colts, the Falcons, the Raiders and now the
Vikings _ took gambles on him. Why they banked on the belief that
they would benefit when the confident, hot-headed George matured.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday the Vikings' 32-year-old quarterback threw three
touchdown passes in the last five minutes of the game, stood in the
pocket firing strikes to Jake Reed and Cris Carter and Randy Moss.
George's final line: 50 attempts, 29 completions, 424 yards, four
touchdown passes, one interception.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why things happen,'' George said. ``Whatever
happened for him this year, he was at the right place at the right
time and was able to showcase what he could do.''
</P>
<P>
   George said the sting of the loss was assuaged by the
satisfaction of playing a season from beginning to end with no
feuds, no outbursts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether that comes from maturity or experience, I don't
know,'' George said. ``I just know this is the first year I've been
able to sit back and just enjoy playing football.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in a long time, everything was cool.

ZILLA LIPPMANN, SUPPORTER OF THEATER, DIES AT 95
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: N.Y.)   (jw) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Zilla Lippmann, a philanthropist and past president of New
Dramatists, a Manhattan-based theatrical organization that helps
playwrights develop new works, died Dec. 27 at her home in
Manhattan. She was 95.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lippmann, a niece of the Broadway producer John Golden,
first worked in his office as a script evaluator and, eventually,
producing associate. She was a founder and president of the John
Golden Fund, a foundation devoted to the support of American plays
and playwriting. She also played a major role in founding New
Dramatists in 1949, served for many years on its board and was its
president in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The John Golden Fund later helped New Dramatists buy its
headquarters at 242 W. 44th St., and Mrs. Lippmann instigated the
creation of dormitory space in the building for visiting
playwrights.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s Mrs. Lippmann developed the New Dramatists'
international playwright exchange program, which was renamed the
Brooks Atkinson Memorial Playwright Exchange in honor of the former
theater critic of The New York Times. The program is now
underwritten by the New York Times Co. Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lippmann was also on the board of the Museum of the City of
New York and helped found and develop its theater collection.
</P>
<P>
   Born Zilla Hymes in New York, Mrs. Lippmann studied biology at
Vassar and graduated from Cooper Union with a degree in chemical
engineering. She married Alfred Lippmann, an advertising executive,
in 1929.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by a daughter, Jill Allgauer of Munich, and
three grandchildren. &QL;

LIFESAVERS SHOW THEY HAVE A HEART
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JESSE HIESTAND 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPOKANE, Wash. -- From the moment surgeons cut open the chest of
a 44-year-old man at UCLA Medical Center, they had less than eight
hours to transplant his new heart -- only it was now stranded in a
snowstorm some 800 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   The carefully choreographed race to pick up the heart had
stalled last week on an icy runway in Spokane, Wash., where
surgeons had just flown from Van Nuys Airport, a Southern
California hub for transplant flights.
</P>
<P>
   The crew sent to de-ice the Learjet was more than an hour behind
schedule, making the transplant team ever more anxious.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clock has just begun for the recipient,'' said surgeon
Anne Sykes, minutes after removing the heart from a man who had
died at the Deaconess Medical Center in Spokane. ``You feel like 30
seconds can make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before midnight, with almost no time to spare, the heart
was delivered to UCLA for a successful transplant that left the
patient resting in stable condition.
</P>
<P>
   As with all such mercy flights, it was another life-or-death
rush for Sykes and pilot Max Falahati, who flew out of Van Nuys
Airport for UCLA, the busiest heart-transplant center in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Each time, there is no guarantee the heart will arrive on time
from points as far away as Georgia and Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if we got killed en route?'' Sykes pondered. ``The
recipient would be at a loss, with their chest open. They don't
have the ability to recover without their new heart.''
</P>
<P>
   The jet, chartered through Clay Lacy Aviation, would typically
fly business executives, Hollywood stars and other high rollers.
That evening it was a flight of life. Each year, Lacy's crews
dispatch about 120 jets to pick up organs or patients, in some
cases doing both at the same time using two different planes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way some of these organs could be brought here if
we didn't have these planes,'' said Dr. Daniel Marelli, who
performed the transplant. The man's identity was withheld for
privacy reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The farther out you go the more critical it becomes because of
limits on preservation,'' said Marelli, director of organ retrieval
for the University of California, Los Angeles, Heart and Lung
Transplant Program.
</P>
<P>
   The flight cost about $4,800, a fraction of the overall cost of
a heart transplant, which averages nearly $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   Dubbed ``lifeguard'' flights, these jets get priority takeoff
and landing over all other flights except those in distress and are
exempt from nighttime curfew rules on noisy jets out of Van Nuys
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the calls are in the middle of the night because the
operating rooms in these hospitals are usually booked in the day,''
said transplant preservationist Azie Alikhani.
</P>
<P>
   People undergoing the procedure have an 80 percent chance of
surviving for five years, compared with just one or two years
without it, Marelli said.
</P>
<P>
   The national United Network for Organ Sharing has some 66,000
people waiting for heart, lung, kidney and other transplants,
although only about one in four get them due to shortages, experts
said.
</P>
<P>
   Owing to the need for transplantable organs, many doctors find
they must go hundreds of miles in just hours to get the organs.
Sykes, 35, has alone procured about 60 hearts in the first six
months of her fellowship, including one last Sunday in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   The hopeful patients wait for a regional organ procurement group
to match them with a donor who has been declared brain-dead -- kept
alive only on a ventilator -- and has similar blood type, organ
size and other physical characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   When a match for the heart patient was found last Tuesday, it
sparked a flurry of calls between UCLA and Spokane. For Sykes, it
would be her third operation of the day, after a 5:30 a.m. heart
procurement at Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center and an
operation to repair a hole in the heart of a 3-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
   By 3:50 p.m., Sykes, Alikhani and third-year medical student
Stacy Thurber arrived at Van Nuys Airport from Westwood and boarded
the five-seat Learjet 24 with their iced-filled cooler.
</P>
<P>
   Six minutes after the hatch was sealed, the jet shot into the
air like a bullet, Falahati and co-pilot Melad Herfeh sharing the
cramped cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time won't wait,'' Falahati said. ``There's no other way to do
it the organs only keep so long.''
</P>
<P>
   Banking over the San Fernando Valley, relaxed in surgical scrubs
and snacking on chips, Sykes quizzed her student on the procedure
they would undertake in little more than two hours. An hour into
the flight, Sykes caught a catnap, laying aside a textbook on
thoracic and cardiovascular surgery, which she said demands
never-ending study.
</P>
<P>
   Moments before landing, Falahati's voice filled the cabin:
``It's snowing in Spokane,'' he warmed the team, just before
hitting strong turbulence that tossed the jet like a kite in the
wind.
</P>
<P>
   The Learjet descended through fog, setting down on the
snow-caked runway of Spokane International Airport at 6:01 p.m. A
slow, seven-mile drive on icy freeways brought the team at 6:30
p.m. to Deaconess, where they joined other doctors already removing
the donor's liver.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety minutes later the UCLA doctors emerged with the heart
steeped in a preserving solution and chilled on ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was going so quick I was just trying to keep up,''
said Thurber, the student. ``I've seen transplants done before but
it was just an organ in the ice box. Now I've seen what it took to
get there.''
</P>
<P>
   The mission hit its first and only glitch on return to the
airport, with the delay in de-icing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this were just another flight then OK, but this is a heart
transplant,'' Alikhani said. ``We just can't be sitting here
twiddling our thumbs.''
</P>
<P>
   Sykes and Falahati huddled on the snowy tarmac, searching
through the fog for the truck that would clear ice from the wings
of the Learjet set to whisk the heart back to Van Nuys.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure from ground crew quickly brought the de-icing truck.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty minutes late, the jet tore down the runway at 8:49 p.m.,
the heart team eating its dinner from foam takeout cartons. The
cooler and its tender cargo rested in a cargo space behind them.
</P>
<P>
   The jet landed back at Van Nuys Airport at 10:54 p.m., where
helicopter pilot Wendy Peterson waited in a Bell Long Ranger.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson ferried the cooler through the fog of the Sepulveda
Pass, delivering the heart team to Operating Room 22 by 11:20 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Five hours later, the man's new heart twitched its first beat.
He remains in stable condition in a recovery that could stretch up
to three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time, it's like you've never done it before because each
moment is so critical,'' Sykes said. ``Even if you've been up for
days you have no sense of fatigue whatsoever.''

HEINRICHS TO BE COACH OF U.S. WOMEN'S TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ April Heinrichs, one of the early stars of
women's soccer in the United States, will replace Tony DiCicco as
head coach of the women's national team, American soccer officials
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Heinrichs, who will be the first woman to coach the women's
national team, will be formally announced as the new head coach at
a news conference in New York on Tuesday. DiCicco resigned in
November, four months after winning the Women's World Cup, saying
he wanted to spend more time with his family.
</P>
<P>
   Heinrichs was a star forward on the American team that won the
inaugural Women's World Cup in 1991, bringing a tenacious style
that has become the trademark of the United States team. She scored
38 goals in 47 games with the national team. She has coached the
past four seasons at the University of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``She knows what it takes to win,'' said Hank Steinbrecher,
secretary general of the United States Soccer Federation. ``She has
very strong leadership, and she's incredibly passionate about the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   No one in the United States soccer community doubts that
Heinrichs, 35, has the potential to be an exceptional coach. The
question is whether she is ready now, with limited international
experience and the Summer Olympics approaching in eight months in
Sydney, Australia. She was the American team's second assistant
coach at the 1995 World Cup and the 1996 Summer Olympics, and she
is head coach of the American under-16 youth team. Her teams at
Virginia have reached the National Collegiate Athletic Association
tournament in each of her four seasons but have not reached the
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   In hiring Heinrichs, the soccer federation passed over Lauren
Gregg, who had been the assistant coach for the United States team
for all three Women's World Cups and the 1996 Olympics. She was
also the head coach of the under-21 team for two unofficial world
championships. DiCicco had recommended Gregg as his successor.
</P>
<P>
   Six months after winning the Women's World Cup, the American
team now finds itself without its head coach and top assistant from
the tournament, and with its players on strike over what they
consider to be an inadequate salary offer from the soccer
federation. The federation has faced heavy criticism for its
handling of the contract negotiations and the hiring of a new
women's coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been called the last bastion of chauvinism since Bobby
Riggs,'' Steinbrecher said, adding that he did not believe the
criticism was justified. ``We're confident we've done what we are
able to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of embracing the World Cup victory, the federation
reacted tepidly to the women's success and for two months did not
offer DiCicco a contract extension. He eventually declined.
Officials in the federation were upset that the women announced
their own indoor tour rather than play in an international tour
that the federation was proposing in Egypt and South Africa. The
federation threatened to sue the women before a compromise was
reached on the indoor tour.
</P>
<P>
   DiCicco has said he thought the federation's anger over the
indoor tour extended to its dealings with him, and that it was
looking for a scapegoat. Some people speculated that Gregg's
candidacy suffered for similar reasons and that the hiring of
Heinrichs amounted to an elegant compromise, allowing the
federation to look progressive by hiring a woman, but a woman other
than Gregg. Neither Heinrichs nor Gregg could be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrecher said he had felt all along that a woman should be
hired to replace DiCicco. ``You've got to be bold as an association
and break the ceiling,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why Heinrichs was hired over the more experienced Gregg,
Steinbrecher said, ``It's a matter of April being a dominant force
in the interview, and showing a great deal of strength and rising
to the top.''
</P>
<P>
   He declined to speak specifically of Gregg's candidacy. Soccer
officials and some players have said privately that they preferred
Heinrichs over Gregg because she was less volatile as a coach and
that they thought the United States needed a change in coaching
philosophy with the rest of the world catching up. Heinrichs is
expected to keep together the core of players who defeated China in
penalty kicks to win the World Cup last July, Steinbrecher said,
while adding some younger talent.
</P>
<P>
   The American women are next scheduled to play on Feb. 6 against
Norway in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., but the regular players are still
without a contract. Steinbrecher said a meeting is scheduled for
Jan. 24 in Los Angeles and that a ``fair and equitable'' offer
would be made. &QL;

SPORTING DIPLOMACY IS GIVEN ANOTHER TRY
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Calif.)   (jw)

<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ In a rematch of a defeat at the 1998 World
Cup, the United States rallied from an awkward start to forge a 1-1
tie with Iran on Sunday before a crowd of 49,212 at the Rose Bowl
that was heavily in favor of the visitors.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans, many of whom are in the off-season of their
professional careers in Major League Soccer, appeared rusty and
slow-footed in the early going. After Cobi Jones hit the post in
the second minute, the Iranian forward Khodadad Azizi began
sprinting right through a sluggish American defense. In the seventh
minute, Azizi played a clever pass to Mehdi Mahdavikia, who split
two American defenders and beat Brad Friedel with a hard-angled
shot from about 10 yards out.
</P>
<P>
   After defensive adjustments, the Americans settled down and did
not give up another goal. The United States tied the score three
minutes into the second half, when Jones crossed a pass from the
right flank that Brian McBride appeared to flick to Chris Armas,
who scored his first international goal.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition result did not compensate for the 2-1 loss to
Iran at the 1998 World Cup in France. But the American coach, Bruce
Arena, said he was satisfied with the performance of the United
States in the final 65 minutes and did not mind a tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't do that well, so kissing my sister isn't the worst
thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Arena did say he was disappointed at the lack of American
support in the crowd, which consisted overwhelmingly of
Iranian-Americans dressed in red, white and green and cheering for
the visiting team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get behind soccer in this country,'' Arena said
Sunday. ``It's disappointing we don't have more people out here
today supporting soccer in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Extra security was on hand, including agents from the FBI in
plainclothes among photographers around the field, according to
officials of the U.S. Soccer Federation. The atmosphere, however,
was festive and peaceful, and the only protests against the Islamic
regime of Iran appeared to be people handing out leaflets.
</P>
<P>
   The Iranian federation has extended an invitation to the
Americans to play a rematch in Iran. If the political and
scheduling logistics could be worked out, Arena said he would be
happy to play Iran again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would look forward to another opportunity,'' he said. &QL;

RETOOLED RANGERS WIN AGAIN, 6-3 OVER ATLANTA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ John Muckler sounded like Henry Armstrong Sunday
afternoon after the Rangers' 6-3 dismantling of the expansion
Atlanta Thrashers at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, the only boxer to simultaneously hold world titles in
three weight classes, coined the phrase ``The best defense is a
good offense.'' Muckler, the 65-year-old coach of the Rangers,
agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to use our offense as our defense,'' Muckler said
after his team won for the fourth time in five games to reach 42
points and pull into a tie with the Carolina Hurricanes and the
Boston Bruins for the eighth and final Eastern Conference playoff
spot. ``A good offense is the best defense to have.''
</P>
<P>
   Muckler was referring to the Rangers' up-tempo, forechecking
style, which is designed to create neutral-zone turnovers and allow
them to play a transition game.
</P>
<P>
   For much of this season, the Rangers had little offense, but
recently that has changed. In their last four victories, the
retooled offense has scored 19 goals. And now the Rangers
(16-20-7-3) will play the Hurricanes in a home-and-home series
Tuesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the Rangers received two goals from a revitalized John
MacLean (one short-handed, one on the power play) and goals from
Jan Hlavac, Mike York, Adam Graves and Valery Kamensky. The
Thrashers' last two goals came after the Rangers had taken a 6-1
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're rolling over four lines, led by Petr Nedved's line, and
it's made a world of difference,'' Graves said.
</P>
<P>
   Nedved's line set the tone for the second consecutive game. On
Saturday, Nedved set up Hlavac for two goals and scored another
himself in a 5-2 victory over the Islanders at Nassau Coliseum. The
first of Hlavac's goals came 50 seconds into the game. Sunday, they
combined to score nine seconds earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Hlavac beat goalie Norm Maracle with a backhander 41 seconds
into the game for his seventh goal of the season. The goal was set
up by Radek Dvorak and Nedved, who shoveled a pass from the slot to
Hlavac, who waited long enough to beat Maracle from just off the
right post, triggering a rout.
</P>
<P>
   MacLean scored the first of his goals at 5 minutes 58 seconds of
the first period while the Rangers were short-handed. It was their
second short-handed goal in two days; they had gone 41 games
without one.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Taylor, who replays showed was offside, set up the
short-handed goal. Taylor's back pass from the blue line sent
MacLean in on Maracle. MacLean's slap shot from the slot slipped
inside the left post for a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-three seconds later, Graves forced a neutral-zone
turnover, which enabled York to score his 12th goal of the season
and pull within a goal of the Devils' Scott Gomez for the rookie
scoring lead. The Rangers had a 3-0 lead on six shots, and Maracle
was pulled 6:41 into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Sylvester of Atlanta (11-28-4-3) cut the lead to 3-1 at
13:36, but then Graves scored a power-play goal off a rebound at
18:06. The goal, his 15th of the season, was Graves' 262nd as a
Ranger, tying him with Vic Hadfield for fourth on the team's career
list.
</P>
<P>
   After a scoreless second period, MacLean scored his ninth goal
of the season and second of the game on the power play at 7:12 of
the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been playing more,'' said MacLean, a 35-year-old right
wing, when asked how he had turned his season around. ``And I'm
getting some power-play time. That always helps, too.''
</P>
<P>
   MacLean then helped set up Kamensky at 11:33 for the Rangers'
final goal. (Alexandre Daigle received the primary assist on the
Rangers' final two goals.) For Kamensky, it was his second goal in
two days, after he had gone 15 games without one.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were two teams we definitely have to beat to make the
playoffs,'' defenseman Mathieu Schneider said of the Thrashers and
the Islanders, the teams with the two worst records in the National
Hockey League. ``Now, we have to carry that over to our next couple
of games.''

NOVELIST CATHERINE RAE DIES AT 85 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Conn., N.Y., Colo., N.J., Texas)  (jw) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Catherine M. Rae, a writer who published her first novel at 73,
died on Dec. 25 at the Connecticut Hospice in Branford. She was 85
and lived in Guilford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after earning her Ph.D. at 65, Ms. Rae wrote her first
book, ``Edith Wharton's New York Quartet,'' a work of literary
criticism about the writer, who with Eudora Welty served as Ms.
Rae's inspiration. The book was published in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Her first attempt at fiction went unpublished after an editor at
St. Martin's Press suggested it was beyond repair and she should
write another.
</P>
<P>
   This resulted in ``Brownstone Facade,'' a mystery romance in the
style and tone of her beloved Wharton set on the Upper East Side of
Manhattan in 1920. It was published in 1988 and called ``a cozy,
intelligent diversion'' by The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Seven other novels followed, among them ``Flight From Fifth
Avenue'' and ``The Hidden Cove'' in 1995 and ``Sunlight on a Broken
Column'' in 1997; an eighth is being edited for publication. Often
set against the backdrop of fin de siecle New York society, her
works frequently centered on a historical event like the Triangle
Shirtwaist Factory fire. Ms. Rae's literary papers _ she was an
avid researcher _ will be donated to the Berg Collection at the New
York Public Library.
</P>
<P>
   She was born in Manhattan and graduated from the Horace Mann
School in 1931. She received a bachelor's degree from Barnard in
1935, a master's degree in teaching from Manhattanville College in
1970 and a Ph.D. in English literature from Denver University in
1979.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rae's husband, Gene, died on Nov. 13. She is survived by a
son, David, of Ridgewood, N.J.; three daughters, Lucy Rae Ricciardi
of Greenwich, Conn., Catherine Rae Reed of Littleton, Colo., and
Mary Louise Rae Arnold of Fort Worth, Texas; and eight
grandchildren.

<TEXT>
<P>
   At Martin Luther King Jr. High School in Manhattan, students are
more than well versed in the life and death of their school's
namesake. So when a jury in Memphis decided last month that King
was not the victim of a gunman acting alone, but was instead the
victim of a far-reaching conspiracy that included the U.S.
government, it made for spirited debate in James O'Brien's law and
justice classes.
</P>
<P>
   Some of O'Brien's students wasted no time in declaring that they
had suspected a conspiracy all along. Others said they were
unwilling to exonerate James Earl Ray as the gunman, unconvinced by
the jury's verdict in the wrongful-death case brought by King's
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had lively debates in class,'' O'Brien said. ``This was
a fascinating turn of history that we could get kids involved in.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the nation, hundreds of commemorations are planned Monday
to honor the life and legacy of King, as they are every year. But
this year's national holiday, marking what would have been King's
71st birthday, comes just weeks after the controversial verdict was
delivered.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, people invested in King celebrations, teaching and
scholarship have found themselves reconciling the verdict with
their own views about what happened, sometimes in discomfiting
ways.
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part, in the days leading up to Monday's
holiday, a time filled with assemblies and spirited recitals of
King's well-known speeches, a prevailing view has been that there
are greater truths in King's legacy than in the lingering
speculation over who killed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The focus is primarily on Dr. King's life,'' said O'Brien, a
part-time lawyer who seized the recent verdict as a current events
topic for his students. ``There's a sense of obligation that each
person has to continue on and to make the world better for
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   At Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, where King preached his
gospel of nonviolence, the Rev. Joseph Roberts Jr. said the verdict
confirmed what he had always suspected: that King's assassination
was a conspiracy. But the minister said he saw no need to raise
that issue during Monday's celebration, which is scheduled to
include Vice President Al Gore. ``I agree with the family that it
is time to move on,'' Roberts said. ``I got a big Bible to dwell
upon.''
</P>
<P>
   King's widow and children have long questioned Ray's 1969
conviction, and hoped that their civil suit would change the legal
and historical record of the assassination. And on Dec. 8, a
Memphis jury seemed to give them what they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   The jury declared that Loyd Jowers, 73, a retired Memphis
restaurant owner, was liable in King's death for purportedly hiring
a Memphis police officer, now dead, to kill King. The jury also
found that unnamed others, including government agencies, had been
involved, in effect accepting the King family's contention that Ray
was innocent, despite his guilty plea. Jowers, through his lawyer,
has said he participated in a conspiracy but did not know it was a
plot to kill King. The jury awarded the King family members the
damages they had sought: $100, which they say they will donate to
charity.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, we know now what happened,'' Dexter Scott King, the
youngest son of King and his wife, Coretta Scott King, told CNN in
an emotional interview shortly after the verdict. ``And for us,
this is a final chapter. This is all we asked for, was a jury of 12
independent people, ordinary people, would hear the evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   But the verdict followed an unusual four-week trial that was
notable for the passivity of the defense, the prevalence of
secondhand and thirdhand accounts and the propensity of the judge
and jurors to nod off during testimony. In an unlikely alliance,
the King family was represented by William F. Pepper, who had been
Ray's lawyer. Without facing a jury, Ray pleaded guilty in 1969 to
killing King, but later recanted. He died of liver disease in
prison in 1998 while serving a 99-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
   To some observers of the King holiday, the Memphis jury's
verdict was no thunderbolt. It did nothing more than reaffirm
long-held beliefs in a conspiracy. For others, the decision was an
irrelevant distraction, an unhelpful bit of hysteria that should
not be inflamed.
</P>
<P>
   And a great many people have reached their own verdict: that the
King holiday is not the time to dwell on such a thing.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, a spokesman for the Martin Luther King Jr. Center
for Nonviolent Social Change said the center's staff members were
rushing to put the entire testimony from the trial on the center's
Web site by month's end. But the spokesman said he was unaware of
any specific plans for the King family to address the verdict.
Throughout Atlanta, there are plans for concerts, dinners, parades
and public service projects sponsored by the King Center as well as
by colleges and schools.
</P>
<P>
   In Memphis, at the National Civil Rights Museum in the old
Lorraine Motel, where King was shot on April 4, 1968, the script
for the tour guides who will shepherd crowds Monday is to be
changed to make note of the recent court case, said Beverly
Robertson, the museum's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will probably tack on the fact that the recent court
findings suggested that there might have been someone else
involved,'' Ms. Robertson said. ``That's all we're going to say at
this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Julian Bond, chairman of the NAACP and a longtime civil rights
advocate and historian, said he hoped that people would use the
holiday to do something that King might have wanted them to do. In
his view, the trial in Memphis was so flawed that the verdict did
not deserve notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a comedy, ridiculous,'' he said. ``I don't think it
enlarged in any way our understanding of Dr. King's death or of Dr.
King himself. We're a conspiratorious country, and with these big
assassinations, King and Kennedy, it is hard for us to think that
one insignificant person could have brought down these mythic
figures, but that's what happened in this case.''

</P>
<P>
   Taylor Branch, a Pulitzer Prize-winning author who has
chronicled King's life in ``Parting the Waters'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster,
1988) and ``Pillar of Fire'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1998), the first
two volumes of a planned trilogy, said he had not once referred to
the verdict in the many speeches about King that he had given since
the verdict. And he said he did not plan to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see it as a distraction,'' Branch said. ``There was plenty
of cynicism about the federal government even before the verdict
among black people and white people, and the verdict only adds to
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the Memphis jury was the first to hold someone
accountable for playing a role in King's assassination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever the disagreement about its conclusion, it is a formal
part of the judicial operation,'' said Russell Adams, chairman of
the Afro-American studies department at Howard University, a
historically black institution in Washington. ``This Memphis
verdict for a lot of people amounted to a formal ratification of
informal opinions which were shaped the day the man was shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams said the verdict provided a ``forlorn but satisfactory
closure'' to the question of whether a conspiracy was at work. But
in the public speeches on King that he presents, Adams said, the
verdict is unlikely to warrant more than two lines. He, for one,
sees a measure of hope in the state of race relations and in the
progress that African-Americans have made through the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a higher standard of deciding what is bad,'' he said.
``Our standards have gone up in terms of what has been done and
what is expected. It doesn't mean I'm happy. I'm not.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Lischer, a professor of divinity at Duke University,
said that if the question of who killed King could be resolved
definitively, Americans could concentrate fully on his message.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as there is the accusation of a massive
government-sponsored conspiracy, we will never get beyond this
climate of distrust in this country,'' said Lischer, author of
``The Preacher King'' (Oxford University Press, 1995).

JAGUARS HOPE THEY DON'T MISS A BEAT WITH RAP SONG 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A rap song several members of the Jacksonville Jaguars recorded
back in November blared over the stadium speakers in the waning
moments of the Jaguars' staggering 62-7 demolition of the Miami
Dolphins in Saturday's American Football Conference divisional
playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   This particular tune, ``Uh-Oh, the Jaguars' Super Bowl Song,''
caused no small amount of discussion in the week leading up to the
game, with questions about whether the song _ which offensive
tackle Leon Searcy, one of the rappers, claimed was never supposed
to be made public _ would be a distraction or whether the Dolphins
would take it as a sign of disrespect.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins did not have to look far for disrespect once the
game began, not when the Jaguars' Fred Taylor was making three
defenders miss him near the line of scrimmage on a draw play that
was supposed to pick up maybe 10 yards and instead resulted in a
90-yard touchdown run. Not when Mark Brunell and the Jaguars
offense _ which entered the game wondering how the battered
quarterback's knees might limit him in the face of the Dolphins'
pass rush _ capitalized on the many Dolphin mistakes to effectively
put the game out of reach before the first quarter was complete and
advance to the AFC championship game against the Tennessee Titans
in Jacksonville, Fla., next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Could the offensive line provide both pass and run protection
with Tony Boselli out and Searcy playing on a sprained ankle? No
problem. The Jaguars outgained the Dolphins by 257-21 on the
ground, Brunell, wearing two knee braces, stood in the pocket
against the Dolphins' early blitz efforts and the final tally of
yardage was 520-131.
</P>
<P>
   On the first play of the second quarter, Brunell exposed the
Dolphins' defense in all its confusion. This was a unit that had
sacked the quarterback six times in Seattle and finished the
regular season fifth against the pass in the league. But on
third-and-14 from the Dolphins' 39-yard line, Brunell was in the
shotgun formation. The ball was snapped, the Dolphins blitzed and
Brunell dumped a simple screen pass to Taylor, who juked his way
past four tacklers on his way to another touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars led by 31-0 and, only 12 seconds into the second
quarter, Brunell put on his baseball cap and had a seat for the
rest of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We watched the Seattle film,'' Searcy said. ``The Dolphins had
a halfcourt game. Run on first down, run on second down. Our game
is all about the fast break. We wanted to control the line of
scrimmage. Hopefully this is a turn of events. The last couple of
games in the regular season, we didn't play our best. We had no
enthusiasm, no desire. It's refreshing to see how we played. This
is an example of what we can do when we stay focused.''
</P>
<P>
   The postseason records set give weight to the domination: most
first-half points (41), second-most points in league history (62),
longest run from scrimmage (90 yards), most opponent fumbles
recovered (5), second-largest margin of victory (55 points) and
most points allowed by the Dolphins in franchise history (62).
</P>
<P>
   By the time it was over, the rap song seemed the perfect
accompaniment for the new swagger and fun of the previously robotic
Jaguars. They lashed out afterward, angry that some had doubted
them because they had not beaten a winning team all season, and
because their only losses came to the only winning team _ the
Titans.
</P>
<P>
   It could be argued that the Jaguars still have not faced a
winning team _ not when the Dolphins played one of the most
listless games in memory _ but for now, doubts about the Jaguars'
ability have been erased. Perhaps other teams have played more
difficult schedules, but it is hard to imagine a more thorough,
all-around beating than the one the Jaguars administered to one of
those tested teams Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said all season long that if we hadn't played anybody yet,
then we'd play what you call good teams in the playoffs,'' Jaguars
receiver Keenan McCardell said. ``We'll see how good we are then. I
guess we showed it.'' &QL;

IVAN D. COMBE, MARKETER OF CLEARASIL AND JUST FOR MEN, DIES AT 88
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Ivan D. Combe, who was responsible for the fame of a medicine
chest of brand-name products including Clearasil and Just for Men
hair coloring, died Tuesday in Greenwich, Conn. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   Combe, who lived in Greenwich, was the chairman and chief
executive of Combe Inc., a privately held company he founded in
1948.
</P>
<P>
   His first marketing coup was Clearasil, an over-the-counter acne
remedy that he and a chemist developed in the early 1950s after
market research with teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   After it became one of the first advertisers on Dick Clark's
television show ``American Bandstand,'' the product was a runaway
success.
</P>
<P>
   Combe sold Clearasil to Vick Chemical in 1960, and shortly
afterward he acquired a little-known company called Grecian Formula
16, a gradual hair-coloring product for men. Through advertising
and marketing, he turned it into an almost iconic brand.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the 1960s, he acquired Lanacane, an itch-relieving
cream, and through energetic advertising he expanded the market for
such products. During the next 30 years, he created or built market
niches for products like Odor-Eaters foot care products, Vagisil
feminine care products and Just for Men instant hair coloring.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was an idea guy _ he just came up with these product
categories and made the products a household word,'' said E. Edward
Kavanaugh, president of the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan DeBlois Combe was born in Fremont, Iowa, on April 21, 1911.
He received a bachelor's degree from Northwestern University and
attended Northwestern Law School. He then became a salesman for
Hydrox Ice Cream and Wilbur Shoe Polish before moving to New York
to work for the Young &AMP; Rubicam advertising agency.
</P>
<P>
   Combe later joined Pharmacraft, a drug manufacturer, but in
1949, at 38 years old, he left his position as vice president for
marketing to create his own company.
</P>
<P>
   Combe served as chairman of the Proprietary Association, which
was later known as the Nonprescription Drug Manufacturers
Association and subsequently the Consumer Healthcare Products
Association. He was also chairman of the World Federation of
Proprietary Medicine Manufacturers, now called the World
Self-Medication Industry.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Mary Elizabeth; two daughters, Diana
Bickford of Dorset, Vt., and Juliette Larson of Queens; his son,
Christopher, of Greenwich; and seven grandchildren.

JAMES MAGUIRE, 95, FORMER LOYOLA UNIVERSITY CHIEF 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Ill., Ind., Ohio)  (lb) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   The Rev. James Francis Maguire, chancellor emeritus and the
president of Loyola University Chicago during 15 years of robust
growth, died on Jan. 10 at the Colombiere Jesuit Community in
Clarkston, Mich. He was 95.
</P>
<P>
   Maguire's leadership was credited with bolstering the
university's academic standing among Roman Catholic institutions of
higher learning and greatly expanding its size and offerings. He
was president from 1955 to 1970, and then was chancellor to 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Under his guidance, Loyola Chicago added a medical center in
suburban Maywood at the cost of $50 million, which exceeded the
university's assets at the time. It was his decision to build the
center, complete with a hospital, medical school, dental school and
outpatient services.
</P>
<P>
   During his tenure, the university, which was established in
1870, became one of the United States' largest Jesuit universities.
It doubled enrollment to more than 14,500, more than doubled the
faculty, raised the operating budget to $37 million from $4
million, expanded its Lake Shore and Water Tower campuses, and
added laymen to its governing board.
</P>
<P>
   Maguire started new academic programs and departments, including
a school of education, a department of anthropology, an institute
of pastoral studies, a center for research in urban government and
Loyola's Rome Center for the Liberal Arts. He started an MBA
program as well as graduate programs in biology, nursing and
classical studies.
</P>
<P>
   Later, as chancellor, he began Loyola's first fund-raising
campaign. And as chancellor emeritus he was in charge of fund
raising and public relations for the university and its hospital
until 1998, when he retired to the Colombiere community in
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   James Maguire was born in Chicago, received B.A. and M.A.
degrees at St. Louis University as well as a Licentiate in Sacred
Theology from St. Mary's College in Kansas. He entered the Jesuit
order in 1922 and was ordained a priest in 1935.
</P>
<P>
   He taught religion, Latin and English and served as an assistant
athletic director in Detroit and Cincinnati schools. He was
president of West Baden College, a seminary in Indiana, from 1943
to 1949, and president of Xavier University in Cincinnati from 1949
until 1955.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves no immediate survivors.

FOR BUCS, IT STARTS AND ENDS WITH DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Tampa Bay Buccaneers are many things _ slow starters but
tenacious finishers, for example _ but more than anything else they
are a defensive creation, a team whose core is a balanced,
throwback defense with traditional up-the-middle strengths.
</P>
<P>
   In Saturday's National Football Conference playoff game against
Washington, the Buccaneers' defense _ hobbling from nagging
injuries and behind for three quarters _ was scrambling to keep up
with the skilled Redskins. Suddenly, three of Tampa Bay's Pro Bowl
defensive players _ a safety, a linebacker and a tackle _ changed
the game in the span of 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   When they were done, the Buccaneers were on their way to
Sunday's NFC championship game with a 14-13 victory. They will face
the St. Louis Rams, far and away the National Football League's
most productive offense. It's a big assignment, but expect Tampa
Bay, with the NFC's top-ranked defense, to tackle it with resolve.
</P>
<P>
   It's what got them through the game against the Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you what was going on in the huddle,'' Warren
Sapp, Tampa Bay's three-time Pro Bowl defensive tackle, said after
the game. ``It was getting pretty late and we were being pushed
around. Guys weren't saying much, just looking at each other like
they were going to explode if this didn't change soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew what each other was thinking: when is somebody going
to make a play? Because we hadn't made one on defense yet. And we
were going to lose if that didn't change.''
</P>
<P>
   Leading in the third quarter by 13-0, Washington was on the move
again when a careless pass by quarterback Brad Johnson was
intercepted by Tampa Bay safety John Lynch, another Pro Bowl
selection.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch gestured to the crowd at Tampa's Raymond James Stadium
after his interception, then ran toward his teammates on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to do something to fire up the offense,'' Lynch said.
``So I ran over to our sideline and spiked the ball as hard as I
could.''
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay Coach Tony Dungy called the interception the turning
point. ``You could feel the energy go from John to the crowd and
back to our team on the field,'' Dungy said.
</P>
<P>
   Six plays later, the Buccaneers had their first points, a Mike
Alstott touchdown run that cut the Redskins' lead to 13-7.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was linebacker Derrick Brooks' turn to impose his will
on the game. On the Redskins' next possession, Brooks, the weakside
linebacker and another Pro Bowl choice, stopped Washington's Brian
Mitchell with a brilliant open-field tackle on a screen pass,
preventing the Redskins from converting a third-and-10.
</P>
<P>
   On the next Washington series, Brooks tackled running back
Stephen Davis for a 2-yard loss on first down, one of an astounding
12 solo tackles that Brooks made.
</P>
<P>
   On the next play, with Washington starting to play a little
harried, Johnson was forced to try a throw on second-and-12. He was
sacked by defensive end Steve White and fumbled. Sapp, the National
Football League's defensive player of the year, recovered the loose
ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew we were going to win right then,'' said Sapp, who also
had a sack in the game and two key tackles in the waning minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Buccaneers' game-winning touchdown drive followed Sapp's
fumble recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a great second-half team,'' Brooks said. ``I'm telling
you, even after they took that 13-point lead, we didn't panic. And
what did we get? An interception, a fumble recovery, two
touchdowns. We win. That's our game.''
</P>
<P>
   Dungy said: ``We've had a good defense for a while, but a belief
and confidence has started to kick in. We get behind by 3 points,
we feel at home. Down by 3, that's a good score for us. These guys
believe, with good reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Against St. Louis, being behind by only 3 points might indeed be
what the Buccaneers are rooting for. The Rams' high-powered offense
and dangerous return game will surely test Tampa Bay's confident
defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell you the truth, part of me hopes it is St. Louis we
play,'' Sapp said before Sunday's Rams-Vikings game. ``Bring on the
best to play the best. If you want to go to the Super Bowl _ the
greatest show on earth _ then you've got to figure on going through
the biggest challenge. Washington was the second-best offense, and
the only touchdown they scored was on a kickoff return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care who we play, but you know that St. Louis' offense
has been the big story all year. Maybe it figures our defense meets
them at center stage.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week's purchase of Beauty.com by Drugstore.com for $42
million in stock marked the first of what could be a rash of
consolidations among online retail categories cluttered with
well-financed _ but poorly patronized _ Web stores.
</P>
<P>
   The beauty category, which includes retailers of perfumes and
cosmetics, certainly qualifies as cluttered, with about 300 sites
with similar names selling similar goods. Add to that list a string
of established mass market retailers like Wal-Mart and CVS that
have begun selling the same items online, and the opportunity for
meaningful market share looks slim.
</P>
<P>
   But these purveyors of glamour have concerns more pressing than
the sheer number of competitors. Analysts say that any online
retailer hoping to make a dent in the estimated $15 billion beauty
market cannot hope to succeed without the cooperation of the Big
Three of the beauty industry _ Lancome, Estee Lauder and Clinique,
which is a unit of Estee Lauder Cos.
</P>
<P>
   Those three brands account for roughly 70 percent of the
so-called prestige beauty goods market, which itself is estimated
at about $4 billion. Not only are those brands crucial for
attracting customers, analysts say, but they provide a much more
reliable source of profit than cheaper mass market goods widely
found on the Web. Besides carrying lower profit margins, mass
market beauty products are also proving a tough sell online, given
that shipping charges can equal the cost of the products
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinique and Lancome sell their goods through their own
Web sites _ and Estee Lauder is expected to do so this year _ all
three companies forbid retailers to sell their brands online. That
has left online retailers to choose between selling more obscure
prestige brands or mass market brands like L'Oreal's Maybelline and
Procter &AMP; Gamble's Cover Girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies like Estee Lauder see their brands as the crown
jewels,'' said Lisa Allen, an analyst with Forrester Research.
``They pay close attention to things like how and where they're
displayed, who they're next to.''
</P>
<P>
   Estee Lauder, which sells exclusively to upper-crust retailers
in the traditional world, would not risk tarnishing its image by
displaying goods in drugstores alongside mass market brands,
analysts said. Likewise, the company's executives are loath to do
the same thing online, where most beauty sites sell a wide range of
brands.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Saks, you buy the whole ambience,'' said Karen Shoenbart,
group president of the NPD Group, a research and consulting firm.
At an online site, she said, ``you could get a jar of moisturizer
for $30, or $10 within a few clicks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How can prestige brands differentiate themselves at an online
store?'' she added. ``Why pay $30, not $10, if you're not enjoying
this shopping experience that much more?''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Angela Kapp, vice president of the online division of
Estee Lauder Cos., said: ``The great danger for prestige brands is
commoditization. We have to be very careful about that because our
brand equity is everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Estee Lauder is ``in the process of defining its overall
strategy'' with regard to the Web, Ms. Kapp said, but the company
``has no plans to sell to Internet pure plays,'' using industry
vernacular for Internet-only merchants.
</P>
<P>
   So the question, analysts said, comes down to whether the
prestige brands can afford not to sell through online retailers
indefinitely, or whether the lure of online profits will outweigh
the fear that the Web will damage brand image.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Allen of Forrester Research said manufacturers of prestige
cosmetics ``should recognize they can still have some control of
their brand while allowing retail partners to sell online.''
</P>
<P>
   She offered an example: ``They can create a microsite, ship it
to the retailer and tell them it's the only way they can display
the products online. That way they protect the crown jewels and use
the Web for what it's good at: marketing, growing the customer
database, doing research and educating existing clients and sales
personnel about the products.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a company microsite _ a collection of Web pages
within another company's site _ is precisely the approach taken by
BeautyJungle.com, a beauty goods retailer that made its debut in
November. BeautyJungle sells products through five different
boutiques within its store, depending on the pedigree of the item
in question. Within the Elite Street boutique, for example,
manufacturers can create so-called ``brand rooms'' _ pages with
large advertisements intended to convey the brand's message.
</P>
<P>
   Elite Street also offers a higher level of customer service than
other boutiques. It features e-mail product consultation, and in
the future will allow for instant messaging or chat consultations,
said Edward LaHood, the company's chief executive. By contrast, the
Main Street boutique, which sells beauty products commonly found in
drugstores, is self-service.
</P>
<P>
   LaHood said he hoped BeautyJungle's Elite Street strategy,
combined with heavy investments in customer service and fulfillment
operations, would ultimately persuade prestige brands to sell to
his site. But he said the company had other sources of revenue in
case those brands continued to shun online retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among those sources is a business-to-business component,
wherein BeautyJungle will create beauty-related sites for other
retailers or manufacturers, and also handle fulfillment and
customer service. LaHood said the company was ``in discussions''
with about 20 potential clients, with the first deal signed by
Bolt.com, a site for teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   Declining to say how much the company would charge for such
services, LaHood asserted that the revenues from the
business-to-business effort would ``eclipse those from the
business-to-consumer side'' within two years.
</P>
<P>
   For competing beauty sites that have no such source of revenue,
but that still want to cater to the high-end beauty market, there
are two possible routes. In fact, both approaches are embodied by
the beauty-related sites that have recently attracted the highest
number of visitors, according to Media Metrix, an online traffic
measurement firm.
</P>
<P>
   Eve.com, which led the Media Metrix rankings of beauty sites in
November, offers a long list of prestige beauty products from
companies that have chosen to sell online, including Awake and
Bvlgari. Meanwhile, it bolsters the more well-known prestige
selections with lesser-known brands like Yohji Yamamoto.
</P>
<P>
   IBeauty.com, on the other hand, sells brands like Estee Lauder
and Lancome on an unauthorized basis, meaning they procure the
products from nonmanufacturer sources.
</P>
<P>
   Elana Posner, executive vice president of IBeauty.com, said,
``This is a sound business practice, because IBeauty's No. 1
priority is meeting customer demand and sustaining high customer
satisfaction with our services.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Inevitably the floodgates will open'' Ms. Posner said, ``as
they did in the retail industry, because as traditional
manufacturers transition to an Internet-friendly business model,
their product supply and distribution practices must shift
accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be true, but analysts said that in the short term,
those beauty sites that cannot serve customers with a full range of
products _ and that choose not to sell unauthorized manufacturer
goods _ will suffer. ``I definitely see more consolidation,'' said
Ms. Allen of Forrester Research. ``I just don't see how a lot of
the cosmetics sites with brands that many mainstream women have
never heard of, never mind bought or used, can ever survive.''

BERNHARD WICKI, 80, EUROPEAN FILM DIRECTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bernhard Wicki, one of the best-known film directors of postwar
Germany, died on Jan. 5 at his home in Munich. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was heart failure after a long illness, his wife,
Elisabeth Endriss, told Reuters.
</P>
<P>
   Though he began his career as an actor, Wicki rose to prominence
as a director with the critically acclaimed ``Die Bruecke'' (``The
Bridge''), his 1959 anti-war movie about a group of high school
students conscripted to defend a bridge in the last days of World
War II. He also directed, with Ken Annakin and Andrew Marton, ``The
Longest Day,'' the 1962 Hollywood war epic with John Wayne, Robert
Mitchum, Henry Fonda, Eddie Albert and Richard Burton.
</P>
<P>
   A Swiss citizen, Wicki was born in Sankt Poelten in Austria and
grew up in Vienna, where he attended the Reinhardt drama school. In
1938 he applied to the Berlin state drama school, led by the German
actor Gustav Gruendgens.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after his acceptance Wicki was deported to the
Sachsenhausen concentration camp because of his previous membership
in a Communist youth organization and his association with the
Bauhaus school of architecture. Through the efforts of Gruendgens,
he was released 10 months later.
</P>
<P>
   During the war Wicki acted in the theaters of Munich; Salzburg,
Austria; and Zurich and Basel, Switzerland. Movie parts followed in
the 1950s, most notably his role as the partisan leader in Helmut
Kutner's ``Letzte Bruecke'' (``Last Bridge'') in 1953. His success
with that film took him to Hollywood, where his roles included a
dying writer in Michelangelo Antonioni's ``Notte'' in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964 he adapted Friedrich Duerrenmatt's play ``Der Besuch der
Alten Dame'' (known in English as ``The Visit'') for the screen.
Starring Ingrid Bergman and Anthony Quinn, the film was poorly
received in the United States, and after his 1965 work
``Morituri,'' with Marlon Brando, Wicki returned to Germany. He
directed until 1986, when he suffered a cerebral hemorrhage. His
last movie, ``Das Spinnennetz'' (``The Spider's Web''), was
released in 1989.

OFF THE WALL: FISHER, REPLAY: NICE MATCH

<P>
   Is Jeff Fisher living right, or what?
</P>
<P>
   The Titans' mustachioed boy wonder looks blessed by the NFL
gods, or at least those in charge of replay rulings.
</P>
<P>
   First, officials don't overrule that controversial miracle
kickoff return in their playoff opener. Then, when he challenges
Sunday's late kickoff return by the Colts, officials rule in his
favor.
</P>
<P>
   There are no bonus points awarded on how you advance _ and it
appeared the officials got it right Sunday. It's all about staying
alive. But really, how far can a tough defense take you? At this
time of the year, all the way to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, the former Taft High star, might find his
Houston-Memphis-Nashville-Tennessee Titans-Oilers underdogs against
Jacksonville in the AFC title game.
</P>
<P>
   But the Titans knocked off Jacksonville in both meetings this
year, and they didn't need any blessed intervention from the NFL
heavens to pull it off.
</P>
<P>
   __ All those who have been doubting the Rams (OK, our hand's
up), better start figuring how to play nice to Georgia. Or at least
how to pretend to.
</P>
<P>
   Good to know some of those millions picked up in the St. Louis
heist have gone back into the team. Not that we're still bitter.
</P>
<P>
   __ 62-7: numbers that defy comment.
</P>
<P>
   __ The really frightening news about Jimmy Johnson's retirement:
It could mean he returns to the broadcast booth.
</P>
<P>
   __ So England decides to overlook its law that would have
prevented Mike Tyson from entering the country because of his rape
conviction, and allow him to fight Julius Francis there.
</P>
<P>
   The man who heads the department overseeing law enforcement,
Home Secretary Jack Straw _ as in ``house of'' _ stepped in and
permitted the Jan. 29 fight to go on, citing special circumstances:
the millions that would be lost if the sellout fight was scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   It's so reassuring to know we are not the only ones capable of
selling out for the all-American dollar, or all-British pound.
</P>
<P>
   __ USC's dominating basketball victory over UCLA was more
impressive than its ugly football victory over the Bruins. But
nothing was as ugly as the Bruins' newest road basketball uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   __ The Mets are making it difficult to keep up with the (Bobby)
Joneses in baseball. After their trade Friday with the Rockies, the
Mets have left-hander Bobby Jones and right-hander Bobby Jones.
Bobby Jones, the former Sixer, is mulling a late career move.
</P>
<P>
   __ Michael Jordan and the hapless Washington Wizards, only a
slightly less stunning merger than AOL and Time-Warner. The Wizards
play in the MCI Center, which just happens to be one of the
companies Jordan regularly hawks on our air waves. Think this means
Bugs Bunny can be had under the cap?
</P>
<P>
   __ We're all for the U.S. women's soccer team getting its
financial due, but you have to think it didn't help the players'
boycotting cause when the ``B'' team easily took the Australian
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   __ Pretty impressive, 66-year-old Ray York becoming the first
jockey to ride in seven decades after he finished next to last in
the final race on Thursday at Santa Anita.
</P>
<P>
   But York has nothing on Encino's Ernie Van Leeuwen, scheduled to
run his third consecutive Los Angeles Marathon and sixth overall on

   INDIANAPOLIS _ When it mattered most, in the sudden-death NFL
playoffs, Tennessee's Eddie George outdueled 1999 NFL rushing
champion Edgerrin James of the Indianapolis Colts yesterday at the
RCA Dome.
</P>
<P>
   George rushed 26 times for 162 yards and a 68-yard touchdown run
on the third play of the second half that put the Titans ahead for
the first time in the game, 13-9, and they never looked back in
winning 19-16.
</P>
<P>
   George, who couldn't help looking ``up'', acknowledged that used
the end-zone Jumbotron television screen to see if anybody was
going to catch him from behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I shouldn't have done that. I tried to focus on just
pumping my legs and not letting a turf monster trip me up,'' said
George, who ran a misdirection play to his left, cut back behind
right tackle Jon Runyan's block, broke into the secondary and was
never caught.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just caught us in a blitz,'' said Colts coach Jim
Mora. ``(The Titans) called the right play at the right time, and
(George) popped it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Titans are now 20-5, including 7-0 this season, when George
rushes for 100 yards or more. This includes the past two weeks in
playoff victories against Buffalo and Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Titans coach Jeff Fisher pulled George aside about 10 minutes
before the game and issued a personal challenge to the fourth-year
running back.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Fisher) asked me to relive Draft Day 1995 and to remember why
he drafted me ... to lead this team to the brink of where we are
now,'' said George. ``He challenged me to live up to those
expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   George did.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie James did not, rushing 20 times for only 56 yards.

RAMS QB SHINES IN THE PLAYOFF SPOTLIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Much of the pre-game doubt about the St. Louis Rams
surrounded quarterback Kurt Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, he threw 41 touchdowns passes in the regular season and
won league MVP honors after being handed the starting quarterback
job after Trent Green suffered a season-ending injury in the
preseason.
</P>
<P>
   But this was the playoffs, the place where legends are made.
</P>
<P>
   Warner, an undrafted free-agent who spent time after college
stocking shelves at a grocery store in Iowa, had never seen a stage
this big.
</P>
<P>
   It is safe to say that the playoffs have seen few guys like
Warner. Warner completed 27 of 33 passes for 391 yards and five
touchdowns to five receivers in leading the Rams to a 49-37 victory
against the Minnesota Vikings in the NFC divisional playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   His completion percentage of 81.8 ranks as the third highest in
playoff history. His quarterback rating of 142.9 was eighth highest
in playoff history. Only two quarterbacks have thrown more than
five touchdowns in a playoff game. . The three combined for 15
receptions for 247 yards, including a 77-yard touchdown catch by
Bruce.
</P>
<P>
   Having running back Marshall Faulk helps as well. Faulk, who led
the team in receptions during regular season, caught five passes
for 80 yards, including a 41-yard touchdown in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   However, the formerly unknown Warner is the man who makes the
Rams go.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all Kurt,'' Hakim said. ``He is a great quarterback. He
sees his reads and makes the right connection.''
</P>
<P>
   Vikings coach Dennis Green, who said he voted for Warner as the
league MVP, is even more of a believer now.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very good player,'' Green said. ``He made a lot of big
plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually Warner has been doing that since his days with the Iowa
Barnstormers when he led them to back-to-back Arena Bowl
appearances in 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Warner is drawing on those Arena Bowl experiences for motivation
in the Rams' playoff run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost those two, and I don't want to lose any more,'' Warner
said.

DAYS AS A TIGHT END PAY OFF FOR RAMS' TUCKER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ For St. Louis Rams backup center Ryan Tucker, it was
just like old times.
</P>
<P>
   He checked into the game at tight end in the goal-line offense,
faked a block and curled to the back of the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   All he had to do was catch and squeeze.
</P>
<P>
   For the third-year veteran Tucker, who played tight end in high
school and as a freshman at TCU before moving to tackle as a
sophomore and center his final two years, it was like riding a
bike.
</P>
<P>
   His 1-yard touchdown pass from Rams quarterback Kurt Warner was
part of a 35-0 run that buried the Minnesota Vikings. Tucker's
score was the fourth of five consecutive second-half touchdowns for
the Rams and made the score 42-17 with 13:36 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lined up as a tackle eligible,'' Tucker said. ``They really
weren't looking for it. But they should have, I guess. This was a
really special touchdown for me.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the second of the season for Tucker. He also had two as a
freshman at TCU.
</P>
<P>
   Rams coach Dick Vermeil said the tackle-eligible play is nothing
new, but he said it's a great play for the Rams because of Tucker,
who he called ``a tremendous athlete who is going to be a good
football player for us.'' BAD-BOY MOSS While the Vikings didn't
live up to expectations, Minnesota receiver Randy Moss lived up to
his advance billing in more ways than one.
</P>
<P>
   Moss, considered by many to be the league's most explosive
receiver, had 9 catches for 188 yards and two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   The two scores of 44 and 2 yards were part of a 21-point Vikings
fourth quarter to help narrow the score from 49-17 to a more
respectable 49-37 final score.
</P>
<P>
   Moss, who was passed over by many teams in the 1998 draft
because of his off-field behavior, showed in the fourth quarter
that his bad-boy nature still remains. Upset because an official
didn't call pass interference after an incompletion, Moss squirted
the official with water, drawing a 15-yard unsportsmanlike penalty.
RAMS' IMPACT SPECIAL Not only did the Rams gash the Vikings on
offense but they hurt them on special teams as well.
</P>
<P>
   Punt returner Az-Zahir Hakim had a 34-yard return in the first
half and kickoff returner Tony Horne ran back four kicks for 174
yards, including a 95-yard touchdown return to open the second
half.
</P>
<P>
   Said Vikings cornerback Jimmy Hitchcock: ``It changed the
momentum big time.''
</P>
<P>
   Down 17-14 at halftime, the Rams scored 35 consecutive points in
the second half. Horne started it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't expect Horne to score,'' Rams coach Dick Vermeil
said. ``But I appreciated it.'' GAME'S SPECIAL LYGHT Nobody could
put into words what yesterday's game meant to the Rams better than
safety Todd Lyght. And even he had trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Lyght, the most senior member of the team, likes to call himself
the Last Man Standing. He was drafted in 1991 and had never played
in a playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been waiting on this moment all my life,'' Lyght said.
``I'm excited for the team. But it's so big for me personally. I
knew the experience was going to be great.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyght said he's far from satisfied. His goal is to play in the
Super Bowl.

BORDER-2 (Phoenix) _ Arizona is America' newest drug mainline. Pot,
methamphetamine and heroin roll across the southern border so fast
and in such large quantities that almost no part of the state is
unaffected. In Nogales, storm drains pro vide a smuggling
superhighway, with traffickers parking over sewer grates to load
cars through holes in the floorboards. A barrio on the east side of
town has begun to empty because of the violence wrought by a
narco-gang whose leader lives just across the fence in Sonora, on a
hill overlooking town. Thickets along the normally dry Colorado
River bed south of Yuma conceal a maze of trails from Baja
California. When the river flowed with runoff last spring,
smugglers ferried loads across by boat. Near Douglas and Naco,
agents exchange gunfire with drug ``mules'' and get into smash-ups
with those running the border by car. By PAT FLANNERY AND DENNIS
WAGNER. Story will move in the ``A'' category.

   MLK (Chandler, Ariz.) _ There's a lingering hurt in Chandler
more than two years after the notorious July 1997 ``roundup'' of
illegal immigrants by Chandler police and federal immigration
agents. Responding to complaints about illegal immigrants
disturbing the peace, officers stopped hundreds of brown-skinned
people _ including U.S.-born His panics and legal immigrants _ and
asked them to prove their citizenship, an action that dam aged
relations between the His panic community and city leaders. To help
still the waters, Mayor Jay Tibshraeny reactivated the Chandler
Human Relations Com mission and appointed 11 resi dents to serve on
the multiethnic panel. This week, the commission launches its most

   TOLERANCE (undated) _ Today, there's &QL; no question that the
religious &QL; 
landscape of the United States is more diverse than it's ever been.
More Muslims now live in the &QL; nation, for &QL; example, than
Presbyterians. But does
this &QL; pluralism mean that Americans are becoming more tolerant of
each other's
faiths? Over the past two weeks, American Muslims have celebrated
iftars _ dinners that celebrate the ``fast breaking'' end of the
holy month of Ramadan _ at the Pentagon, on Capitol Hill, and at
the White House. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright hosted the
first Ramadan dinner for American Muslim leaders last month at the
State Department. Public events such as these suggest a growing
openness. Shifting U.S. immigration patterns, interfaith marriages,
growing numbers of converts to non-Western religions and, thanks to
the Internet, easily accessible facts on diverse faiths, have
changed the look of the national religious landscape. However, says
Rabbi Robert Kravitz, executive director of the American Jewish
Committee's Arizona office, there's a big difference between
tolerance and respect. And understanding this difference is the
challenge people face in this increasingly diverse religious
climate. By MAUREEN JENKINS. Story will move in the ``L'' and ``K''

BRADLEY SEEKS WIDER SUPPORT AMONG BLACKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WATERLOO, Iowa _ A gospel choir belted out hymns of hope. A
banner proclaimed, ``Dreams Come True, Bill.'' And Bill Bradley,
who badly needs to boost his standing among black voters if he is
to win the Democratic presidential nomination, told predominantly
black crowds of voters Sunday night that he would serve as a
surrogate for the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. if he became
president.
</P>
<P>
   As a prelude to a major debate on minority issues Monday night
with Vice President Al Gore, Bradley invoked his firsthand view of
racism as an athlete and his work on civil rights as a US senator
in appealing to black voters to embrace his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, the former NBA star and Olympic basketball champion,
has yet to broadly connect with black voters, who typically play
prominent roles in the Democratic primaries in southern
battleground states from South Carolina to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to remain true to (King's) legacy,'' Bradley told
supporters at the Waterloo Museum of Art. ``I ask myself, `What
would he want a president to do at this time in our history?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley delivered a similar message soon afterward at a dinner
here honoring the slain civil rights leader. At both events, he
aimed his remarks far beyond the borders of this overwhelmingly
white state.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, for example, renewed his call for South Carolina to
forsake the confederate design on its state flag. ``From my
perspective, that flag should come down,'' he said, reiterating a
position he staked on the issue last April.
</P>
<P>
   Gore entered the fray Saturday by calling for the flag's
removal, a stance that is widely popular among black voters who
consider the confederate symbol emblematic of slavery.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating an attack from Gore, Bradley's campaign disclosed
this weekend that Bradley had accepted $900 in federal subsidy
payments for his farm in Missouri after voting against the program.
Bradley also missed a Senate vote on a measure to protect Iowa
farmers because he was on tour promoting his autobiography,
documents show. While farm matters are sure to be a concern in
Iowa, Bradley stuck to the wooing black voters Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys show Gore leads Bradley by as much as 2-1 among black
voters, largely because of the Clinton administration's active
support for civil rights issues. But Bradley's camp believes the
support may shift if Bradley picks up momentum in the early
primaries before the contest heads South in March.
</P>
<P>
   Railing against racism, Bradley stepped up his effort to bond
with black voters by saying that even though he could not feel the
pain of racial discrimination, he recognizes it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that must kill something in you,'' he said. ``I can
never know it the way you know it, but I can see it, and I know it
must end.''

LEASE OFFERED TO COYOTES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Regardless of who owns the Phoenix Coyotes, Jerry Colangelo said
Sunday that he is willing to draw up a new, temporary lease
extension that will allow the team to remain at America West Arena
until a new venue is built for the National Hockey League fran
chise in north Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes' lease at America West Arena expires after next
season and owner Richard Burke has said he has no intentions of
keeping the team there beyond the 2000-2001 season, at which point
a five-year lease agreement would kick in automatically.
</P>
<P>
   But a disagreement between Burke and the Ellman Cos. on
financing and a construction schedule for the $535 million re
development project at Los Ar cos Mall, anchored by an 18,000-seat
hockey arena, might make it impossible for the Coyotes to move in
until the 2002-2003 season.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with that alternative, and mounting annual losses re
portedly $10 million to $15 mil lion, Burke recently informed the
Ellman Cos. that he would be willing to sell the franchise and step
out of the picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard Burke has gone pub lic as saying he wouldn't go back
to America West Arena,'' said Colangelo, president of the NBA's
Phoenix Suns and managing gen eral partner of Major League
Baseball's Arizona Diamond backs. ``But now that there is
speculation of the team being sold or is in the process of being
sold, we certainly aren't going to put the Coyotes out in the
street.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was never our intention. Our intention was to always re
tain them. But if they are set on moving, we'll do what we can to
help them through the transition. If that means working something
out for them to stay for an additional year or more, we're more
than happy to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo said that stands whether the Coyotes are owned by
Burke or someone else, such as entertainment mogul Barry Kemp, who
has expressed inter est in the past of buying the hockey team. Kemp
owns a 6 per cent interest in the Suns and is a former executive
director of the Phoenix Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Kemp, however, could not be reached for comment to confirm
whether he is one of at least three prospective buyers Burke said
have approached him in the past two weeks. Burke has re fused to
identify the possible new investors.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he had person ally contacted Burke with his offer,
Colangelo said, `No. I'm telling you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, tell him I appreciate that very much, it's magnani mous,
and that I will give him a call,'' Burke said. ``Tell him, `Thank
you.' That will get fac tored into the equation and it helps.''
</P>
<P>
   Because America West Arena is operated by the Phoenix Arena
Development Co., an entity of Suns' ownership, Colangelo basi cally
serves as the building's landlord.
</P>
<P>
   `WE'LL TRY TO HELP'
</P>
<P>
   ``In the spirit of cooperation, we'll try to help them here,''
Colangelo said. ``Having been through this process myself, hav ing
built a couple of venues such as America West Arena and Bank One
Ballpark, I know agreements have to be in place, negotiations have
to be concluded, land has to be cleared, and plans drawn up.
</P>
<P>
   ``My gut feeling tells me it's going to take a little longer
than people think (for the Los Arcos project to get under way).''
</P>
<P>

   `BEST INTEREST OF TEAM' ``I'm going to do what's in the best
interest of the team, making sure that it stays here, and getting
that arena built,'' Burke said. ``That's it in a nutshell. If I can
own it and the circumstances allow it, I will. If not, then I'll
make sure it's somebody who's committed to here and this proj ect
and that it gets done.

John Berdo's family barn, in Washington, Iowa, epitomizes agrarian
life and the beauty of the American countryside. The barn built by
his great-great-grandfather in the1850s will be bulldozed in
February and the old boards will be burned. Modern metal storage
buildings which are cheaper and bigger are taking over the
landscape, if short on charm. Farmers today rely on high-powered
machines, much too large to be stored in the old wood barns, while
livestock is often confined to low-slung metal sheds, which look
nothing like the old barns. (Paul Hosefros/The New York Times)

-- Visitors passing the Washington Monument where workers have
begun dismantling the scaffolding. The strongest issue in sight
these days in Washington is whether the restoration scaffolding
surrounding the monument has proved to be a more glorious
attraction than the monument itself. For the past 18 months, the
scaffolding, created by the architect Michael Graves, has delighted
the city as an entirely free-standing structure, a lacy workplace
unattached to the monument that served to elegantly mime and
highlight the shape of the 555-foot obelisk. (Stephen Crowley/The

Colombian Ambassador Luis Alberto Moreno-Mejia, 46, hates his
country's reputation among Americans. ``I'm sure that if you did a
poll, the first thing that would come to mind is the association
with cocaine,'' he says. ``I think the self-esteem of Colombians is
very much hurt when we are perceived this way.'' An important
victory for Moreno-Mejia came last week, when President Clinton
announced a $1.3 billion emergency aid package to Colombia to help
the government of President Andres Pastrana in its war against
narcotics traffickers and the leftist guerrillas who control much
of the cocaine trade. (Shana Raab/The New York Times)

IN U.S., A GROWING RELIGIOUS DIVERSITY

 (EDITORS: THIS STORY ALSO MOVING IN THE ``K'' CATEGORY)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Today, the religious landscape of the United States is more
diverse than it'sever been. More Muslims now live in the nation,
for example, than Presbyterians. But does this pluralism mean that
Americans are becoming more tolerant of each other's faiths?
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two weeks, American Muslims have celebrated
``iftars'' _ dinners that celebrate the ``fast breaking'' end of
the holy month of Ramadan _ at the Pentagon, on Capitol Hill, and
at the White House. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright hosted
the first Ramadan dinner for American Muslim leaders last month at
the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   Public events such as these suggest a growing openness. Shifting
U.S. immigration patterns, interfaith marriages, growing numbers of
converts to non-Western religions and, thanks to the Internet,
easily accessible facts on diverse faiths, have changed the look of
the national religious landscape.
</P>
<P>
   However, says Rabbi Robert Kravitz, executive director of the
American Jewish Committee's Arizona office, there's a big
difference between tolerance and respect. And understanding this
difference is the challenge people face in this increasingly
diverse religious climate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tolerating means, `OK, my neighbor is different, obnoxious and
stupid, and I'll tolerate that he lives there,' '' said Kravitz,
also a member of the steering committee of the InterFaith Action
Coalition of Arizona, with members belonging to more than 10
faiths. ``That's not a positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Kravitz is encouraged by the relationships built among clergy
within the InterFaith Action Coalition and by the school programs
that encourage students and teachers to celebrate diversity. But he
says society still has a long way to go when it comes to real
interreligious respect.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 4, he stormed out of the mayoral and City Council
inauguration ceremony at Phoenix's City Hall because an invocation
from a Lutheran pastor and songs by a Lutheran school choir made
him, a Jew, feel left out. Rather than just seethe about it, he
dashed off letters to Mayor Skip Rimsza and the chairman of the
city's Human Relations Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're tired of hearing, `Oops, I've made a mistake,' ''
Kravitz said. ``There's absolutely no excuse for these types of
incidents to keep occurring. We are all to be included, not
excluded.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is optimistic is that there is an awareness that when
something is insensitive, someone will usually say, `Oops' _ and
they usually are not members of the offended groups. That means
people are really beginning to care about their neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's in learning about the vibrant faiths of these
neighbors, Kravitz says, that real acceptance can come. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DIVERSITY NOTHING NEW &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although today's religious scene is changing rapidly, the United
States has, from its earliest days, been home to diverse faith
traditions.
</P>
<P>
   It's never been the monolithic Christian nation that some claim,
says Charles Lippy, author of the forthcoming ``Pluralism Comes of
Age: American Religious Culture in the Twentieth Century'' (M.E.
Sharpe,$34.95).
</P>
<P>
   From Roman Catholic Spanish mission builders to New England
Puritans, from Chinese immigrants in the West to the Native
Americans already here, America has been an ethnic, cultural and
religious stew.
</P>
<P>
   But many scholars say that 1965 amendments to the Immigration
and Nationality Act are most responsible for the religious
diversity that now exists. These changes opened the doors to people
from Asia and the Middle East, who brought faiths such as Islam,
Buddhism and Hinduism with them.
</P>
<P>
   What's most remarkable now, Lippy says, is that today's
immigrants aren't trying to dissolve in a mythological melting pot.
He says they practice and celebrate their faiths on their own
terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I see happening with Muslims and Hindus is that those who
bring their religious traditions don't (feel) like they have to fit
in,'' said Lippy, also professor of religious studies at the
University of Tennessee-Chattanooga. ``They're going to do their
own thing. I don't see new religious expressions defining
themselves against Protestant and Christian hegemony.''
</P>
<P>
   And because Muslims are building mosques and Hindus and
Buddhists are constructing temples in neighborhoods across the
country, Harvard University professor Diana L. Eck says, mainstream
Americans are getting a firsthand look at faith traditions they
know little about.
</P>
<P>
   Eck directs the Pluralism Project, a Harvard-based research
group that studies and documents U.S. religious pluralism. For the
past decade, students have done ``hometown'' research in cities
such as Denver, Houston and Phoenix, delving into various faith
communities to show the complexity of the nation's religious
fabric.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that surprises me is that this rather radical
transformation is happening in all sorts of places,'' said Eck,
professor of comparative religion and Indian studies at Harvard,
and one of the nation's best-known scholars on religious diversity.
``It's no longer just the big cities that are the ports of entry _
we're beginning to see this everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Chattanooga _ heart of the Southern Bible Belt _
now is home to three Islamic mosques, one Hindu temple, and a
Church of God that holds worship services in Filipino, Lippy says.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, these communities can be here and flourishing
and folks not know they exist,'' Lippy said. ``An awful lot of
Southern folks were not aware how much this had penetrated. They
might be glad to have a good Indian or Thai restaurant in their
neighborhood, but they don't necessarily connect (them to)
flourishing Hindu and Buddhist religious expressions.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PLURALISM TO ENGAGEMENT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, Eck says, members of minority religious faiths are
moving into the American public sphere. She mentions the recent
Ramadan celebrations in Washington as an example.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a sense in which we have begun to acknowledge in
public ways that Islam is a religion of America,'' Eck said. ``One
might say these things are ceremonial and pro forma, but they are
the kind of indications of the fact we have an Islamic population
that's making a bid for participation in public life.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, Hindus, Sikhs, Native Americans and Muslims are
establishing political advocacy groups. They run for public office.
They petition companies they feel disrespect their religious
traditions. They're working within the system to bring about
awareness and, they hope, understanding.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Shabbir Mansuri, founding director of the
California-based Council on Islamic Education, did 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Disturbed because of inaccurate depictions of Muslims in his
then-sixth-grade daughter's social-studies book, this native of
India quit his chemical-engineering job to help textbook publishers
include balanced views of Islam for elementary and high school
students.
</P>
<P>
   Using state-mandated standards, 18 university scholars do
research for the organization and provide it to publishers such as
Houghton Mifflin and Prentice Hall for social studies and world
history texts. They also maintain speakers bureaus and hold
education workshops for teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our system allows us to sit at the table and contribute,''
Mansuri said. ``To me, it is the most incredible way one can
correct if there is misinformation.''
</P>
<P>
   Mansuri thinks religious slights come from ignorance rather than
malice. And by taking a personal step to move beyond offense,
Mansuri's group now influences thousands of teachers and students
nationally each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to address the issue in terms of complaining,
but to provide the information so it would be accurate in the first
place,'' he said. ``Publishers say, `My God _ this is the answers
to our prayers.' And what I call this is our American way. I think
we need to participate in that spirit.'' &QL;

   Eck directs the Pluralism Project, a Harvard-based research
group that studies and documents U.S. religious pluralism. For the
past decade, students have done ``hometown'' research in cities
such as Denver, Houston and Phoenix, delving into various faith
communities to show the complexity of the nation's religious
fabric.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that surprises me is that this rather radical
transformation is happening in all sorts of places,'' said Eck,
professor of comparative religion and Indian studies at Harvard,
and one of the nation's best-known scholars on religious diversity.
``It's no longer just the big cities that are the ports of entry _
we're beginning to see this everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Chattanooga _ heart of the Southern Bible Belt _
now is home to three Islamic mosques, one Hindu temple, and a
Church of God that holds worship services in Filipino, Lippy says.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, these communities can be here and flourishing
and folks not know they exist,'' Lippy said. ``An awful lot of
Southern folks were not aware how much this had penetrated. They
might be glad to have a good Indian or Thai restaurant in their
neighborhood, but they don't necessarily connect (them to)
flourishing Hindu and Buddhist religious expressions.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PLURALISM TO ENGAGEMENT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, Eck says, members of minority religious faiths are
moving into the American public sphere. She mentions the recent
Ramadan celebrations in Washington as an example.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a sense in which we have begun to acknowledge in
public ways that Islam is a religion of America,'' Eck said. ``One
might say these things are ceremonial and pro forma, but they are
the kind of indications of the fact we have an Islamic population
that's making a bid for participation in public life.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, Hindus, Sikhs, Native Americans and Muslims are
establishing political advocacy groups. They run for public office.
They petition companies they feel disrespect their religious
traditions. They're working within the system to bring about
awareness and, they hope, understanding.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Shabbir Mansuri, founding director of the
California-based Council on Islamic Education, did 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Disturbed because of inaccurate depictions of Muslims in his
then-sixth-grade daughter's social-studies book, this native of
India quit his chemical-engineering job to help textbook publishers
include balanced views of Islam for elementary and high school
students.
</P>
<P>
   Using state-mandated standards, 18 university scholars do
research for the organization and provide it to publishers such as
Houghton Mifflin and Prentice Hall for social studies and world
history texts. They also maintain speakers bureaus and hold
education workshops for teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our system allows us to sit at the table and contribute,''
Mansuri said. ``To me, it is the most incredible way one can
correct if there is misinformation.''
</P>
<P>
   Mansuri thinks religious slights come from ignorance rather than
malice. And by taking a personal step to move beyond offense,
Mansuri's group now influences thousands of teachers and students
nationally each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to address the issue in terms of complaining,
but to provide the information so it would be accurate in the first
place,'' he said. ``Publishers say, `My God _ this is the answers
to our prayers.' And what I call this is our American way. I think
we need to participate in that spirit.'' &QL;

<P>
   Names can be such awkward things. Since the days of Adam, man
has busily tagged his things and thoughts and, more recently, even
his increasingly careful measures of time.
</P>
<P>
   And he has been nothing if not demanding: decades and eras have
gained not just a noun but also an adjective. The ``hungry
forties'' summed up times of want in Britain 150 years ago. This
century the twenties have roared in America and the sixties have
swung in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Even lesser decades have had labels: the depressed thirties, the
square fifties and the greedy eighties.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes a challenge. So far, the next decade is unbaptized.
</P>
<P>
   An adjective, in advance of actually experiencing the period,
would be too much to expect. But a noun is needed to follow on from
the seventies, eighties and nineties. But what? The problem is all
those zeros.
</P>
<P>
   There is no shortage of candidates for the new name. One Web
site (www.namethedecade.com) has instituted a competition to decide
on one.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 40 or so candidates are the millies, the singles, the
two-thousands, the two-Gs, the zips or zippies, the blanks, the
O-somes, the zeros and the ``tainties'' _ ``'cause it t'aint the
nineties, and it t'aint the teens.''
</P>
<P>
   Democracy, Internet-style, may be one way to find an answer, and
readers may well wish to make their votes count. But only after
proper reflection and even _ despite this e-era _ respect for
history.
</P>
<P>
   At the last century's turn a similar problem was solved when the
first decade became known as the nineteen-hundreds. Follow that
principle and we will soon enter the twenty-hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   Too fuddy-duddy and pre-millennial? Some prefer instead the Y2K
(Year Two Thousand) as the first of the D2K, and the D2k the first
of the C2K.
</P>
<P>
   This would be a terrible shame: no sooner had we rid ourselves
of the perhaps-awful-but-certainly-awfully-named Y2K bug than we
would be bugged by a whole algebraic era.
</P>
<P>
   Some people, faced with that ghastly prospect, favor various
permutations of zeroes instead. Yet the ohs, triple-ohs, trios,
noughts or the (minimalist) nils and nulls all fail to inspire _
although the zeroes were reckoned, by one British polling company,
to be a popular choice among the public.
</P>
<P>
   Equally the 0-0s, pronounced as the ``uh-oh,'' are really too
apprehensive.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, some good names remain available. The millies, or
the millie-nillies, could be popular and appropriately millennial.
But they are surely too flighty.
</P>
<P>
   One can proudly boast of being a child of the swinging sixties;
who would want to be a child of the silly millie-nillies?
</P>
<P>
   The aughts or naughts could also tempt, but lack the satisfying
``ties'' which give other decades' names a pleasing ring at the
end.
</P>
<P>
   So there can be only one solution, which fortunately can already
be found on the popular lists: a name which has the right tone,
rhythm and sense of fun, yet won't saddle the next generation with
distracting connotations.
</P>
<P>
   It must be the naughties. &QL;

A GLORIOUS DESERT _ AND THEN SOME: AUTHOR'S PURPLE PROSE STILL
RESONATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BOOK REVIEW of:
 ``The Desert:  Further Studies in Natural Appearances'' 
 By John C. Van Dyke (Johns Hopkins, $16.95) 
 &HT;     By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   John C. Van Dyke's ``The Desert'' has been a classic since it
was first published in 1901. Beaten, frayed copies of the book's
many editions sell for good money in used bookstores to those
connoisseurs who appreciate Van Dyke's peculiar brand of
lunacy-genius.
</P>
<P>
   For Van Dyke _ an art critic and professor at Rutgers University
at the turn of the century _ was a master of over-the-top, purple
prose: descriptive enthusiasm as literature. He is so extreme, he
is brilliant.
</P>
<P>
   In describing the desert, in minute detail and in raptures of
syntax, he has few peers. He manages to take one tiny bit of
observation and make it seem, at any given micromoment, the whole
of creation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Desert'' belongs in the library of every reader who loves
the dry areas of the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   This new paperback edition is graced with a critical
introduction by Peter Wild, who makes quite clear that Van Dyke
was, in some ways, a fraud. Rather than the farsighted ecologist he
makes himself out to be, he was an effete Easterner, and probably a
bag man for robber baron Andrew Carnegie _ who is the dedicatee of
the book.
</P>
<P>
   Van Dyke pretended he had spent two years wandering the deserts
of Arizona, California and Mexico. In reality, he visited his
brother in California, traveled across Arizona on train and carried
a bribe from Carnegie to a former union agitator who had fled to
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the truth of Van Dyke's biography, he was a profound
observer of what he saw, and a brilliant writer.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to quote small bits of Van Dyke's special brand of
prose. It flows on like a great river, carrying all before it in
cascades of paean. You cannot swim against its current.
</P>
<P>
   When he talks about the adverse effect of human habitation on
the environment, he says, ``Even the grizzly, secure in the
chaparral of his mountain home, flinches as he crosses the white
man's trail. The boot mark in the dust smells of blood and iron.''
</P>
<P>
   In that simple phrase, ``blood and iron,'' he manages to imply
the entire 2,000-year history of war and technology that has been
the European legacy.
</P>
<P>
   One of my favorite sections of the book is Van Dyke's
description of the color of the air in the desert. He goes on for
pages describing minute distinctions in the cast of color the air
gives the landscape, and he manages to describe the effect so
accurately, that anyone who has spent time in the desert recognizes
the truth of Van Dyke's eyesight.
</P>
<P>
   In the chapter ``Desert Sky and Clouds,'' he describes the
stratus clouds: ``This veil of sheet-cloud might be called a
twilight cloud, giving out as it does its greatest splendor after
the sun has disappeared below the verge. It then takes all colors
and with singular vividness. At times it will overspread the whole
west as a sheet of brilliant magenta, but more frequently it blares
with scarlet, carmine, crimson, flushing up and then fading out,
shifting from one color to another; and finally dying out in a
beautiful ashes of roses. When these clouds and all their
variations have faded into lilac and deep purples, there are still
bright spots of color in the upper sky where the (cirrus clouds)
are receiving the last rays of sun.''
</P>
<P>
   The popular objection to purple prose comes from the inexact and
hyperbolic verbifications of inferior scribes, who use the fancy
words in place of having something to say. But when a baroque
literary sensibility, such as Van Dyke's, meets a genuine subject,
the verbal fireworks are, in fact, more accurate, and more moving,
than any calculated understatement. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   For once, the superlatives and the hype seem justified.
</P>
<P>
   The $150 billion takeover of Time Warner by America Online (AOL)
is not just another record-breaking deal, more notable for its size
than its significance.
</P>
<P>
   It is, to use an expression much beloved of Intel's Andy Grove,
an ``inflection point'' _ one of those events that have the
potential to change the competitive landscape so fundamentally that
nothing can be the same again.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the deal has immense implications for media and
communications companies _ and for their audiences. But it may also
mark the moment when the distinction between pure Internet
companies and their bricks-and-mortar equivalents begins to blur as
the former realize they should use their heady valuations to lock
in solid assets and the latter accept, as Time Warner's Gerald
Levin has done, that in some sense ``the value creation of the
Internet is real.''
</P>
<P>
   What the marriage of Time Warner and AOL symbolizes is the
beginning of a trend towards convergence between online and offline
companies, each recognizing the strengths that the other brings.
</P>
<P>
   In coming to their agreement, both Time Warner and AOL have had
to accept that each needs the resources and skills of the other to
compete successfully in the future.
</P>
<P>
   That Time Warner, with its brands, content and distribution
channels, has embraced this deal so enthusiastically is an
extraordinary admission of the difficulty that many traditional
companies face when trying to adapt their businesses to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Its own in-house efforts to move the company in that direction
have pretty much failed.
</P>
<P>
   As for AOL, it has had to recognize that, despite its
preeminence on the Internet and a market capitalization that made
it by far the world's most valuable media company, it is still a
vulnerable enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   AOL is dangerously dependent on subscriptions at a time when
more and more firms offer free Internet access; and it may have
difficulty gaining access to cable systems, which are increasingly
seen as the best way to bring broadband services to the consumer. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 225 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 350) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, its shares are valued in effect at
75 cents on the dollar, a kind of discount for Internet volatility.
</P>
<P>
   And, for all the (fairly plausible) talk of the wondrous
opportunities that lie before the merged company, it is hard to
avoid the conclusion that Steve Case has decided there will never
be a better time for AOL to cash in its chips.
</P>
<P>
   After all, if he thought that the next 12 months were likely to
be a repeat of the last, he could expect to pick up Time Warner for
half the price in AOL stock this time next year.
</P>
<P>
   If Case's shareholders continue to support this deal, they may
implicitly be calling the peak of the market's Internet frenzy. But
they are also making another point, of huge importance for the
current corporate fashion for establishing Internet spin-offs (the
latest is Wal-Mart) and tracking stocks. It is that the fashion
will fade.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem essential for now to create Internet stock market
value, a currency that can be used to acquire other assets. But
unless there are good operational reasons for separation, once
important lessons have been learned and valuation multiples have
started to converge, these offshoots may well be reintegrated with
their parent companies. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the end, nearly all companies will be Internet companies in
the sense that all companies today are telephone companies: the
Internet will be so deeply embedded in their being that they no
longer think about it. If the merger between Time Warner and AOL
works as intended, they will simply have got there a little earlier
than most.
</P>
<P>
   But what will we watch? The deal, like all big mergers, takes a
punt on the ability of two corporate cultures to work together. In
this case, AOL stands to lose some agility.
</P>
<P>
   As for Time Warner, already a monster with more than 67,000
employees, it will be owned by a business that employs a mere
12,000.
</P>
<P>
   But an even bigger bet has been placed on the way people will
want to be entertained and informed in future.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 20 years, the media business has been moving from
broadcasting to narrowcasting. All media companies used to produce
one identical product _ a film, a newspaper or a broadcast
television network _ which they slapped out to as many consumers as
they could.
</P>
<P>
   Cable television changed that by starting to fragment the
audience. Cable networks had to approach their audiences in a
different way to the broadcasters: they had to develop niche
programming, which meant thinking about what made people different,
not what they had in common. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 150 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 800) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>

<P>
   For once, the superlatives and the hype seem justified.
</P>
<P>
   The $150 billion takeover of Time Warner by America Online (AOL)
is not just another record-breaking deal, more notable for its size
than its significance.
</P>
<P>
   It is, to use an expression much beloved of Intel's Andy Grove,
an ``inflection point'' _ one of those events that have the
potential to change the competitive landscape so fundamentally that
nothing can be the same again.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the deal has immense implications for media and
communications companies _ and for their audiences. But it may also
mark the moment when the distinction between pure Internet
companies and their bricks-and-mortar equivalents begins to blur as
the former realize they should use their heady valuations to lock
in solid assets and the latter accept, as Time Warner's Gerald
Levin has done, that in some sense ``the value creation of the
Internet is real.''
</P>
<P>
   What the marriage of Time Warner and AOL symbolizes is the
beginning of a trend towards convergence between online and offline
companies, each recognizing the strengths that the other brings.
</P>
<P>
   In coming to their agreement, both Time Warner and AOL have had
to accept that each needs the resources and skills of the other to
compete successfully in the future.
</P>
<P>
   That Time Warner, with its brands, content and distribution
channels, has embraced this deal so enthusiastically is an
extraordinary admission of the difficulty that many traditional
companies face when trying to adapt their businesses to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Its own in-house efforts to move the company in that direction
have pretty much failed.
</P>
<P>
   As for AOL, it has had to recognize that, despite its
preeminence on the Internet and a market capitalization that made
it by far the world's most valuable media company, it is still a
vulnerable enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   AOL is dangerously dependent on subscriptions at a time when
more and more firms offer free Internet access; and it may have
difficulty gaining access to cable systems, which are increasingly
seen as the best way to bring broadband services to the consumer. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 225 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 350) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, its shares are valued in effect at
75 cents on the dollar, a kind of discount for Internet volatility.
</P>
<P>
   And, for all the (fairly plausible) talk of the wondrous
opportunities that lie before the merged company, it is hard to
avoid the conclusion that Steve Case has decided there will never
be a better time for AOL to cash in its chips.
</P>
<P>
   After all, if he thought that the next 12 months were likely to
be a repeat of the last, he could expect to pick up Time Warner for
half the price in AOL stock this time next year.
</P>
<P>
   If Case's shareholders continue to support this deal, they may
implicitly be calling the peak of the market's Internet frenzy. But
they are also making another point, of huge importance for the
current corporate fashion for establishing Internet spin-offs (the
latest is Wal-Mart) and tracking stocks. It is that the fashion
will fade.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem essential for now to create Internet stock market
value, a currency that can be used to acquire other assets. But
unless there are good operational reasons for separation, once
important lessons have been learned and valuation multiples have
started to converge, these offshoots may well be reintegrated with
their parent companies. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the end, nearly all companies will be Internet companies in
the sense that all companies today are telephone companies: the
Internet will be so deeply embedded in their being that they no
longer think about it. If the merger between Time Warner and AOL
works as intended, they will simply have got there a little earlier
than most.
</P>
<P>
   But what will we watch? The deal, like all big mergers, takes a
punt on the ability of two corporate cultures to work together. In
this case, AOL stands to lose some agility.
</P>
<P>
   As for Time Warner, already a monster with more than 67,000
employees, it will be owned by a business that employs a mere
12,000.
</P>
<P>
   But an even bigger bet has been placed on the way people will
want to be entertained and informed in future.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 20 years, the media business has been moving from
broadcasting to narrowcasting. All media companies used to produce
one identical product _ a film, a newspaper or a broadcast
television network _ which they slapped out to as many consumers as
they could.
</P>
<P>
   Cable television changed that by starting to fragment the
audience. Cable networks had to approach their audiences in a
different way to the broadcasters: they had to develop niche
programming, which meant thinking about what made people different,
not what they had in common. &QL;

   ``Ben,'' says McQuire in ``The Graduate'' film, ``I just want to
say one word to you _ just one word. Plastics. There is a great
future in plastics.''
</P>
<P>
   Most environmentalists are not with McQuire. They think of
plastics as the stuff that drifts on to beaches, floats into trees
and blows about in gutters. For over a decade, they have lobbied to
curb the use of plastic and replace it with more natural materials.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s American environmentalists won a famous
victory when McDonald's, in the face of a vociferous campaign,
decided to replace the polystyrene ``clamshells'' in which it
served hamburgers with wraps made mainly of paper.
</P>
<P>
   The onslaught led plastics companies to develop elaborate
recycling schemes and ``biodegradable'' versions of the material.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, properly used, plastic may do less environmental harm
than the materials it so often replaces.
</P>
<P>
   That environmentalists should worry about plastic is
understandable enough. It has been the fastest growing kind of
domestic trash. It is difficult to recycle, mainly because of the
problem of separating the different polymers.
</P>
<P>
   Although the plastics industry strenuously tries to think of

bodies has reduced the growth in demand for fuel; so has the use of
plastic rather than glass containers to carry food and drink.
</P>
<P>
   In landfills, plastics take up much less space than paper. Even
in the wasteful United States, plastics account for about 13
percent of municipal waste after recycling, paper for 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to reduce the pressure on city dumps would be to
ration newsprint, not wrappings.
</P>
<P>
   If environmentalists are to love plastics, though, the industry
must do more than brag of its green credentials. It must work with
governments to keep its products off the streets _ not to mention
beaches and verges.

<P>
   Making good products is important. So is using them
responsibly. &QL;

   ``Ben,'' says McQuire in ``The Graduate'' film, ``I just want to
say one word to you _ just one word. Plastics. There is a great
future in plastics.''
</P>
<P>
   Most environmentalists are not with McQuire. They think of
plastics as the stuff that drifts on to beaches, floats into trees
and blows about in gutters. For over a decade, they have lobbied to
curb the use of plastic and replace it with more natural materials.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s American environmentalists won a famous
victory when McDonald's, in the face of a vociferous campaign,
decided to replace the polystyrene ``clamshells'' in which it
served hamburgers with wraps made mainly of paper.
</P>
<P>
   The onslaught led plastics companies to develop elaborate
recycling schemes and ``biodegradable'' versions of the material.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, properly used, plastic may do less environmental harm
than the materials it so often replaces.
</P>
<P>
   That environmentalists should worry about plastic is
understandable enough. It has been the fastest growing kind of
domestic trash. It is difficult to recycle, mainly because of the
problem of separating the different polymers.
</P>

CIA TELLS CLINTON AN IRANIAN A-BOMB CAN'T BE RULED OUT

 By JAMES RISEN and JUDITH MILLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a sharp departure from its previous assessment
of Iran's nuclear capacity, the CIA has told senior Clinton
administration officials that Iran might now be able to make a
nuclear weapon, according to several U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
   George Tenet, director of central intelligence, began briefings
in December about the agency's new assessment, shortly after the
document was completed, the officials said. The new evaluation has
touched off a sharp debate about Iran's nuclear capacity, and the
CIA's ability to monitor it.
</P>
<P>
   CIA officials refused to comment on the new assessment. But the
more ominous evaluation of Iran's nuclear capacity, which was
described to The New York Times by American officials, is
apparently not based on evidence that Iran's indigenous efforts to
build a bomb have achieved a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, it seems to be based on the fact that the United States
cannot track with great certainty increased efforts by Iran to
acquire nuclear materials and technology on the international black
market, mainly from the former Soviet Union, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA has found it difficult to track such transactions, and
thus the assessment has been carefully hedged by its analysts.
Washington has also made little headway with efforts to weaken the
longstanding strategic relationship between Iran and Russia, which
is brimming with nuclear weapons and stockpiles of the fissile
material Tehran needs to make a nuclear bomb.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has told policy-makers that it is not certain that
Iran actually has atomic weapons now. Instead, the new assessment
says that the CIA can no longer rule out the possibility that Iran
has acquired them, in contrast to previous assessments that
excluded that possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Even with those caveats, the CIA's new assessment has prompted
strong debate within the government. The new analysis is being
disputed by Clinton administration policy-makers and some analysts
at other American intelligence agencies who believe that Iran's
efforts to build its own bomb are still moving slowly, American
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   They say there is no evidence that Iran has succeeded in
building its own weapon, or that it has stolen or acquired enough
fissile material to make one. The CIA began to warn policy-makers
nearly a decade ago that Iran was likely to have nuclear weapons
around the turn of the century. Now that the new century has
arrived, the agency is offering a cautious warning that it can no
longer be sure whether Iran has made more progress on its atomic
program than previously believed.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Clinton administration officials have tried to play down
the significance of the CIA's new assessment, apparently eager to
avoid damaging efforts toward rapprochement with Iran's new
reformist leader, President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   One view held by some Clinton administration officials is that
the new assessment is an attempt by CIA analysts to avoid criticism
in the future for failing to warn policy-makers if Iran someday
joins the ranks of states with nuclear weapons. The officials
believe that the agency has been singed by criticism after previous
intelligence failures: missing signs that India was about to test a
nuclear weapon in 1998, and being surprised by the advanced state
of Iraq's nuclear program, revealed after the Persian Gulf war of
1991.
</P>
<P>
   In view of the debate over the new CIA assessment, officials are
now considering whether to order a formal National Intelligence
Estimate, which would call for all of the agencies in the
intelligence community to contribute to a government-wide appraisal
of Tehran's nuclear capacity.
</P>
<P>
   The latest CIA assessment implicitly acknowledges what many
American officials say is a severe problem for the United States:
the shortcomings of intelligence about both the Iranian program and
the spread on the black market of weapons-grade fissile material
from the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, CIA analysts are warning that, given Iran's intensive
efforts to steal or buy highly enriched uranium and plutonium, it
is possible that it may have more bomb-grade material than
previously believed.
</P>
<P>
   The scientific and technical know-how to build a bomb is useless
without sufficient quantities of highly enriched uranium or
plutonium, the ``fissile material'' at the heart of an atomic
weapon.
</P>
<P>
   It has proved extraordinarily difficult for countries like Iran
and Iraq to generate enough material to make a bomb on their own.
Western analysts say that the most likely sources are the
stockpiles of Russia and other countries of the former Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
   Ukraine and Kazakhstan, both of which had nuclear weapons or
related materials and technology on their territory during Soviet
times, have renounced weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Kazakhstan rebuffed efforts by Iran to buy beryllium
from a storage site that also contained more than 600 kilograms of
highly enriched uranium, enough to make dozens of nuclear bombs.
Two years later, Washington secretly flew the fuel out of the
country to prevent Iran and other would-be nuclear powers from
acquiring it.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia, still brimming with stockpiles of nuclear fuel and
weapons- related technology, has long sold sensitive nuclear and
missile technology to Iran, and assisted Tehran's civilian atomic
energy program over objections from Washington, which fears that
Iran's domestic nuclear power program is being used to develop
indigenous weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's concerns that Russia might be
broadening its nuclear trade with Iran to include heavy water and
graphite technology led the United States a year ago to impose
sanctions against two Russian scientific institutions.
</P>
<P>
   After the sanctions were imposed, Iran denied it was cooperating
with such institutions to develop missiles and nuclear weapons.
Last March, Yevgeny Adamov, Russia's atomic energy industry
minister, said Russia would continue its commercial nuclear
cooperation with Iran, especially its program to help Iran complete
two large reactors at Bushehr, one of which was damaged in the
Iran-Iraq war.
</P>
<P>
   Just last Friday, Russia's defense minister met with a top
Iranian security official and pledged to maintain Moscow's military
ties with Tehran.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``You don't understand the role of the president of
the United States.'' Thus John McCain, the Republican front-runner
in New Hampshire, to George W. Bush, the favorite nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The charge is the sort of rhetorical exaggeration that comes
from campaigning. But it is instructive all the same.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the contrasts of temperament, and gender preference
(women prefer Bush by 17 percentage points; men prefer McCain by 14
points), the campaign has thrown up fundamental differences not
just over policy, but over how the two men make policy, and how
they might therefore govern as president.
</P>
<P>
   These differences have been dramatized by their tax plans. This
week, McCain unveiled a cut that is surprisingly modest by
Republican standards: $240 billion over five years, half Bush's
promised $483 billion reduction over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, as befits a crusader against special interests,
McCain's cut would be partly financed by closing $150 billion in
corporate tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between this approach and Bush's has reopened an
old division in Republican ranks between tax-slashing supply-siders
and what used to be called ``green-eyeshade Republicans'' _ fiscal
conservatives concerned about balancing the budget.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when tax cuts are losing some of their appeal, McCain
seems to be trying to reverse 20 years of supply-side dominance in
his party.
</P>
<P>
   Policies, of course, change all the time. For a president, it is
just as important to know how people make policy. The tax debate
has revealed something about this too _ partly inadvertently.
</P>
<P>
   The weeks of campaigning have shown McCain to be an improviser,
relying on his instincts as much as on a small team of little-known
advisers.
</P>
<P>
   When he first started outlining his tax proposals, he seemed not
to know the details of the so-called ``marriage penalty'' or the
earned-income tax credit. Even now, it is unclear which corporate
loopholes will be closed completely.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, when he first released details of his health-care
plan, most of the figures turned out to be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Had Bush stumbled in this way, he would have been torn apart by
the press. But in contrast to McCain, he has gathered a huge team
of Republicans, the best and the brightest, and used their
expertise to present his policies as a carefully thought-through
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, in a series of speeches, Bush not only went into
detail on his education, welfare and tax proposals but also tried
to show how they fit together under the umbrella of ``compassionate
conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference is that between a commander-in-chief, setting the
broad aims of policy but making up the details as he goes along,
and a chairman of the board, using teams of advisers to think
through issues in fine detail. One is not necessarily better than
the other.
</P>
<P>
   It is a common political distinction. But if carried through to
the White House, the contrasting tendencies would produce very
different styles of government.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is likely to favor a more collegiate, cabinet-dominated
style, while McCain would presumably act, in the words of Bob
Packwood, a McCain supporter and former senator from Oregon, as
``his own chief of staff.''
</P>
<P>
   The two differ not only on individual policies but also on their
range of interests.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has a traditional broad Republican agenda. In contrast,
McCain seems like a two-trick pony. On foreign affairs, he has more
expertise than almost anyone else in the race. But in his domestic
policy, all roads lead to campaign finance.
</P>
<P>
   Asked a question about almost any issue, he tends to reply, in
effect: ``My friends, we can't improve our schools (or the Army, or
Social Security, or Medicare) unless we get special interests out
of politics. That means changing our system of campaign finance.''
</P>
<P>
   The message has strong electoral appeal. It acts as an
organizing principle to explain his candidacy and has merits in its
own right. Yet the claim that campaign-finance reform will
transform the prospects for other policy changes in America seems
hugely exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   The problems of the Social Security or Medicare systems are
rooted in many things, notably demography; special interests play
only a secondary role.
</P>
<P>
   Hyping up campaign reform therefore poses a risk for McCain. If
he were to become president, and the reform were shot down (as
seems likely, on past experience), the organizing principle of his
presidency would be wrecked at the start.
</P>
<P>
   Even if it were passed, it would not make much difference to
other intractable policy problems. Either way, a sense of
disappointment would be inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's traditional broad approach is not subject to the same
risks.
</P>
<P>
   The two men are also offering different approaches to the vital
question of dealing with Congress. Bush is the favorite of the
Republican establishment, backed by the vast majority of the
party's congressmen, senators and state governors; in his own
state, he commands near-universal support, even among Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, McCain inspires distrust even in his own party. But
he does command the support of many independents and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   As Oscar Wilde said of Bernard Shaw, he hasn't an enemy in the
world and none of his friends like him. This may not matter that
much.
</P>
<P>
   Packwood argues that if McCain were nominated, it would be
amazing how quickly his colleagues would discover they were friends
after all.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Chuck Hagel, one of his few Senate supporters, argues
that after 17 years there McCain would be better equipped than most
to deal with Congress. At least he knows how it works.
</P>
<P>
   All this is no doubt true, but even McCain's supporters concede
that, to build support there, he would have to rely heavily on
Democrats (as he has done over campaign-finance reform). He would
also be likely to use Reagan's tactic of appealing direct to voters
to put pressure on Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, to judge by his record in Texas, Bush would adopt
the traditional strategy of uniting his own party first and then
attracting a few centrist Democrats to plump out the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   He is by preference a deal-maker, and has used his skills in his
home state to push large tax cuts and education reform through the
legislature; though admittedly it is not clear how his experience
in Texas (where the legislature meets for only four months every
two years) will translate to the national stage.
</P>
<P>
   Still, at a time of prosperity, and in a Congress where neither
party is likely to command a big majority, Bush's deal-making
skills would seem more effective than McCain's solitary style of
leadership _ unless he gets an overwhelming mandate for change at
the polls. &QL;

 WASHINGTON: with Tehran. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Russia intends to maintain the dynamics of its bilateral ties
with Iran in the military, military-technical, scientific-technical
and energy fields,'' said Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, according
to the Interfax news service.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials have denied that Moscow is helping Iran
develop nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Iran also steadfastly denies it has a nuclear weapons program.
Since 1970, its diplomats say, it has been a member in good
standing of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which bars states
without nuclear weapons from acquiring them, and also requires that
civilian atomic facilities be inspected by international observers.
</P>
<P>
   But Iran has continued expanding its nuclear power sector even
though it is among the world's largest oil producers. Along with
uranium deposits, a uranium-ore concentration facility and two
research reactors, Iran has two nuclear research centers, including
one in the central Iranian city of Isfahan, where American analysts
believe Iran is trying to make the explosive core of an atomic
device.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Khatami was elected president in 1997, Iran replaced
the head of its atomic energy program, Reza Amrollahi, who was
widely seen as incompetent, with Gholamreza Aghazadeh, a former oil
and gas minister who is regarded as a better manager and
politically connected.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's program, however, is still viewed as deeply troubled,
American officials say.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to nuclear assistance, the United States believes
that Russian companies and other organizations have provided Tehran
with critical technology related to the development of ballistic
missiles that could carry nuclear weapons. In a national
intelligence assessment issued last year, the American intelligence
community said it believed that by 2010 Iran, using Russian
technology and assistance, might test a missile that could reach
targets in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Assessments about foreign nuclear programs have always been
highly contentious, largely because of the sensitive diplomatic and
political issues they raise. American intelligence officials knew
for years, for example, that India and Pakistan were close to
becoming nuclear powers, even as successive American
administrations chose not to acknowledge that publicly for fear of
damaging other American economic and political interests in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   The United States also has not officially acknowledged that
Israel has long had nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But the debate over Iran's nuclear program has been more about
facts than politics, with concern mounting steadily in the past
decade. With limited intelligence about the Iranian program and
Russian nuclear proliferation, the intelligence agencies have been
reluctant to draw hard conclusions about Iran's nuclear potential.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, for example, The New York Times reported that a draft
CIA report said Iran could develop a nuclear weapon by the year
2000. The next year, the agency calculated that Iran could develop
a nuclear weapon in eight to 10 years, according to a paper by W.
Seth Carus, a defense analyst at the National Defense University.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, another CIA assessment concluded that Iran was three to
five years from having a nuclear weapon, according to a
knowledgeable former American official. But the former official
criticized the analysis for relying too heavily on information from
Israeli intelligence, which has had an interest in convincing the
United States that Iran poses a strategic threat.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, widespread agreement that Iran intends to
acquire nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   David Albright, a nuclear analyst in Washington, said that Iran
would inevitably intensify efforts to acquire nuclear weapons in
response to Iraq's activities. Although it agreed this week to
permit very limited international inspections of its nuclear
facilities, Iraq, Iran's historic regional rival, has refused to
permit inspections for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iran has made it clear that it will not be the last major
country in the region to develop nuclear weapons,'' Albright said.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``You don't understand the role of the president of
the United States.'' Thus John McCain, the Republican front-runner
in New Hampshire, to George W. Bush, the favorite nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The charge is the sort of rhetorical exaggeration that comes
from campaigning. But it is instructive all the same.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the contrasts of temperament, and gender preference
(women prefer Bush by 17 percentage points; men prefer McCain by 14
points), the campaign has thrown up fundamental differences not
just over policy, but over how the two men make policy, and how
they might therefore govern as president.
</P>
<P>
   These differences have been dramatized by their tax plans. This
week, McCain unveiled a cut that is surprisingly modest by
Republican standards: $240 billion over five years, half Bush's
promised $483 billion reduction over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, as befits a crusader against special interests,
McCain's cut would be partly financed by closing $150 billion in
corporate tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between this approach and Bush's has reopened an
old division in Republican ranks between tax-slashing supply-siders
and what used to be called ``green-eyeshade Republicans'' _ fiscal
conservatives concerned about balancing the budget.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when tax cuts are losing some of their appeal, McCain
seems to be trying to reverse 20 years of supply-side dominance in
his party.
</P>
<P>
   Policies, of course, change all the time. For a president, it is
just as important to know how people make policy. The tax debate
has revealed something about this too _ partly inadvertently.
</P>
<P>
   The weeks of campaigning have shown McCain to be an improviser,
relying on his instincts as much as on a small team of little-known
advisers.
</P>
<P>
   When he first started outlining his tax proposals, he seemed not
to know the details of the so-called ``marriage penalty'' or the
earned-income tax credit. Even now, it is unclear which corporate
loopholes will be closed completely.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, when he first released details of his health-care
plan, most of the figures turned out to be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Had Bush stumbled in this way, he would have been torn apart by
the press. But in contrast to McCain, he has gathered a huge team
of Republicans, the best and the brightest, and used their
expertise to present his policies as a carefully thought-through
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, in a series of speeches, Bush not only went into
detail on his education, welfare and tax proposals but also tried
to show how they fit together under the umbrella of ``compassionate
conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference is that between a commander-in-chief, setting the
broad aims of policy but making up the details as he goes along,
and a chairman of the board, using teams of advisers to think
through issues in fine detail. One is not necessarily better than
the other.
</P>
<P>
   It is a common political distinction. But if carried through to
the White House, the contrasting tendencies would produce very
different styles of government.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is likely to favor a more collegiate, cabinet-dominated
style, while McCain would presumably act, in the words of Bob
Packwood, a McCain supporter and former senator from Oregon, as
``his own chief of staff.''
</P>
<P>
   The two differ not only on individual policies but also on their
range of interests.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has a traditional broad Republican agenda. In contrast,
McCain seems like a two-trick pony. On foreign affairs, he has more
expertise than almost anyone else in the race. But in his domestic
policy, all roads lead to campaign finance.
</P>
<P>
   Asked a question about almost any issue, he tends to reply, in
effect: ``My friends, we can't improve our schools (or the Army, or
Social Security, or Medicare) unless we get special interests out
of politics. That means changing our system of campaign finance.''
</P>
<P>
   The message has strong electoral appeal. It acts as an
organizing principle to explain his candidacy and has merits in its
own right. Yet the claim that campaign-finance reform will
transform the prospects for other policy changes in America seems
hugely exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   The problems of the Social Security or Medicare systems are
rooted in many things, notably demography; special interests play
only a secondary role.
</P>
<P>
   Hyping up campaign reform therefore poses a risk for McCain. If
he were to become president, and the reform were shot down (as
seems likely, on past experience), the organizing principle of his
presidency would be wrecked at the start.
</P>
<P>
   Even if it were passed, it would not make much difference to
other intractable policy problems. Either way, a sense of
disappointment would be inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's traditional broad approach is not subject to the same
risks.
</P>
<P>
   The two men are also offering different approaches to the vital
question of dealing with Congress. Bush is the favorite of the
Republican establishment, backed by the vast majority of the
party's congressmen, senators and state governors; in his own
state, he commands near-universal support, even among Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, McCain inspires distrust even in his own party. But
he does command the support of many independents and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   As Oscar Wilde said of Bernard Shaw, he hasn't an enemy in the
world and none of his friends like him. This may not matter that
much.
</P>
<P>
   Packwood argues that if McCain were nominated, it would be
amazing how quickly his colleagues would discover they were friends
after all.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Chuck Hagel, one of his few Senate supporters, argues
that after 17 years there McCain would be better equipped than most
to deal with Congress. At least he knows how it works.
</P>
<P>
   All this is no doubt true, but even McCain's supporters concede
that, to build support there, he would have to rely heavily on
Democrats (as he has done over campaign-finance reform). He would
also be likely to use Reagan's tactic of appealing direct to voters
to put pressure on Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, to judge by his record in Texas, Bush would adopt
the traditional strategy of uniting his own party first and then
attracting a few centrist Democrats to plump out the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   He is by preference a deal-maker, and has used his skills in his
home state to push large tax cuts and education reform through the
legislature; though admittedly it is not clear how his experience
in Texas (where the legislature meets for only four months every
two years) will translate to the national stage.
</P>
<P>
   Still, at a time of prosperity, and in a Congress where neither
party is likely to command a big majority, Bush's deal-making
skills would seem more effective than McCain's solitary style of
leadership _ unless he gets an overwhelming mandate for change at
the polls. &QL;

also be likely to use Reagan's tactic of appealing direct to voters
to put pressure on Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, to judge by his record in Texas, Bush would adopt
the traditional strategy of uniting his own party first and then
attracting a few centrist Democrats to plump out the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   He is by preference a deal-maker, and has used his skills in his
home state to push large tax cuts and education reform through the
legislature; though admittedly it is not clear how his experience
in Texas (where the legislature meets for only four months every
two years) will translate to the national stage.
</P>
<P>
   Still, at a time of prosperity, and in a Congress where neither
party is likely to command a big majority, Bush's deal-making
skills would seem more effective than McCain's solitary style of
leadership _ unless he gets an overwhelming mandate for change at
the polls. &QL;

WELL-ORGANIZED FORBES CAMPAIGN COURTS IOWA CONSERVATIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT CANON  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Iowa _ The Knights of Columbus hall and bingo parlor
isn't quite full. Still, more than 100 people interrupted a weekday
morning to make time for a politician. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes _ part candidate, part celebrity, entirely rich man
_ had brought his hunt for caucus voters to town. He baited the
hall with a modest chili lunch. His aides made sure the Iowa and
American flags would frame his backdrop. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In an age when most campaigns can barely afford to hand out
stickers, this one gives away pin-on Forbes buttons. Wait around
afterward and the candidate will gladly autograph your Forbes mouse
pad or a staffer might hand over a blaze-orange Forbes T-shirt. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If the come-and-get-it freebies don't offer enough appeal,
Forbes' speech is calculated to soothe the Iowa conservative. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Full of applause lines, it bashes politicians and politics (nods
and clapping). It slams the tax system _ ``the infernal, I mean
Internal Revenue Service'' (laughter backed by applause). It
promises parents the chance to use vouchers to help pay for sending
their children to private school (more applause). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' second presidential candidacy is determined not to
repeat the mistakes of the first, four years ago. Where the first
was long on advertising and short on organization, the second is
long on both. Where the first was a one-idea mantra _ flat tax _
the second trumpets several themes popular among conservatives. And
where the first one failed for lack of enthusiasm from social
conservatives, the 2000 bid preaches primarily to that voting
bloc. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the core remains the wealthy candidate, the man who has
successfully led the publishing empire he inherited. The
52-year-old publisher and father of five is articulate, but his
manner of speaking is unexciting, his hand gestures stilted. He
seems almost trapped behind his thick glasses and uncomfortable, if
unendingly friendly, in meeting voters one-on-one. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' strength, beyond the personal millions poured into the
campaign, is clarity of message and the often aggressive tone he is
willing to take. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As in 1996, when his January lead in the Iowa polls proved
fleeting, Forbes has anchored his campaign on his so-called flat
tax. His plan would eliminate nearly all deductions and tax all
Americans at a rate of 17 percent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to let the American people keep more of what you
created in the first place,'' he tells audiences time and again. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But in 2000, his message is more sophisticated. Gone is the
robotic repeating of his promise of ``hope, growth and
opportunity.'' In its place comes a more spiritual appeal _ ``the
cause of redeeming America'' _ likely to score well among socially
conservative Republicans. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If America gets it right,'' Forbes likes to say, ``the rest of
the world has a chance to get it right.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The biggest difference in Forbes' current strategy is his stand
on abortion. Last time, it was an issue he responded to in moderate
terms, and he was criticized from the party's right flank for not
making more specific pledges. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This run he is all promises on the issue, all hard-line. He will
only pick a running mate who opposes abortion rights. His judicial
nominees must oppose it as well. He hammers regularly at
front-runners George W. Bush and John McCain for not making the
same pledges. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His speeches noticeably avoid the word abortion, preferring
instead to talk of ``the life issue.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I am pro-life and I believe in the life amendment'' to the
U.S. Constitution banning abortion, he says. ``The first baby
picture for most couples nowadays is the sonogram. It visually
demonstrates a separate person with a separate soul....The new
birth of freedom should start with the freedom to be born.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With 12 days to go before the caucuses, he began airing his
first TV ad on the issue. In it, one woman gushes about the results
of her ultrasound, ``my tiny child's heart beating, arms waving.''
Another mother says ``just because someone doesn't want them
doesn't mean that these children aren't still alive.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The ads began airing the day after Forbes used a debate to
accuse Bush of hedging on the issue. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He also has bought air time to bash the Texan on taxes _
accusing him of breaking a no-tax pledge as governor in a way that
hints of former President George Bush's ill-fated ``read my lips''
promise of no new taxes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 30 seconds, Mary C. Williams of the Houston-based Taxpayers
for Accountability speaks _ her voice nearly breaking _ of how Gov.
Bush signed a pledge in 1994 not to raise business or sales taxes
and then signed a bill increasing them in 1997. The ad, repeated in
radio form on stations across Iowa, does not note that the
increases were made to offset property tax cuts in Texas. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If being negative means telling the truth, then I will tell
the truth,'' Forbes said in defending the spots. ``(Bush) made a
pledge in Texas that he would not raise the sales tax. He broke
that pledge.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail, Forbes dubs Bush and McCain the ``timid
tax twins'' because they don't endorse his flat tax. And, to a
degree, scrapping the federal income tax system rests at the heart
of Forbes' hopes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to do away with the (inheritance) tax. I like to say,
no taxation without respiration.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Forbes wants to give workers more control over their Social
Security contributions, suggesting they be allowed to put at least
part of those payments into individual retirement accounts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``So even somebody making $25,000 a year could begin to build up
something that when they reach retirement is hundreds of thousands
of dollars. We'd have real nest eggs for real working people as
never before,'' he tells his audience. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the end of each speech, Forbes calls on a local organizer to
take the microphone to encourage people to sign cards that will put
them in the Forbes data bank. They're reminded of the date of the
caucuses, of the time and that it might be some place other than
where they usually vote. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Forbes has recruited more than 4,000 precinct captains across
Iowa's 99 counties. That, says one scholar of the caucuses, makes
it the best-ever organization in the state. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I got in the race very late'' in 1996, Forbes told reporters.
``The difference between this time and '96 is we've had the time to
build up genuine grass roots support.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That translated into Gene Strohman being lured to Forbes' stop
in Washington by a friend and ``the chance to see somebody
famous.'' Strohman, a retired farmer, was pleased that Forbes
``didn't look as dorky as he does on TV.'' He liked, too, the flat
tax and that the candidate ``is a successful businessman instead of
just a politician.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Strohman said he is torn between Forbes and Bush. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I like what Forbes says better,'' the farmer said. ``But I
think Bush is more connected and might know how to get things
done.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, Strohman said, Forbes has his attention. &QL;

<P>
   CHICAGO _ January should be a quiet time for Midwestern farmers.
Instead, they find themselves facing one of the hardest farming
decisions of the year: should they risk putting genetically
modified (GM) crops in the ground, or not?
</P>
<P>
   For some, the agronomics are easy; they believe that GM products
expand yields and lower costs.
</P>
<P>
   But if American consumers were to become suddenly concerned
about ``Frankenstein foods,'' as some Asians and Europeans already
have, then, come the autumn, farmers may be sitting on a bountiful
harvest that has lost much of its value.
</P>
<P>
   For a farmer like Darl Baumgardner, who grows maize (corn) and
soybeans in Illinois, there is much to like about GM crops.
</P>
<P>
   Bt corn, for example, uses a gene derived from a soil bacterium,
Bacillus thuringiensis, to make the whole corn plant toxic to the
corn-borer, a caterpillar that drills into the corn cob and
destroys the crop.
</P>
<P>
   Herbicide-resistant soybeans are engineered to be immune to a
powerful herbicide that will kill all other vegetation on the
cropland, making it easier for farmers to get rid of weeds.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, it is hardly surprising that the percentage of
American soybean acreage planted with GM soybeans grew to over 50
percent in the four years after commercial introduction, an
adoption rate nearly twice as fast as that for the most dominant
agricultural technology of the past, hybrid corn.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Kalaitzandonakes, a professor of agribusiness at the
University of Missouri who has done those calculations, also
reckons that the benefits to farmers of GM soybean technology alone
were in the order of $400 million-$1 billion in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   When your correspondent drove into the heartland two years ago,
farmers were effusive about the potential of biotechnology.
Consumers, particularly those outside the United States, have not
been so keen on the idea.
</P>
<P>
   There is no credible evidence yet that GM foods present a health
risk to consumers. But the European Union has withheld approval of
some GM crop varieties until exhaustive trials are done, and many
Europeans have decided that they would rather not buy those
products that have been approved. Some large supermarket chains
have refused to stock the suff.
</P>
<P>
   The EU allows GM soybeans, but it is increasingly looking to
non-GM suppliers, such as Brazil, and to alternative ingredients.
As a result, American soybean exports to the EU have plunged from
398 million bushels in 1997-98 to an estimated 221 million bushels
in 1999-2000.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Wisner, an Iowa State University economist, reckons this is
the equivalent of losing a market for one out of every three
bushels of soybeans grown in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the problem just in Europe. Both Japan and Korea have
announced plans to begin labelling certain GM commodities
(unprocessed corn and soybeans) in the spring of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   A prominent Japanese soy-sauce manufacturer announced in
December that it would use non-GM soybeans in the future.
</P>
<P>
   South of the border, Mexico's largest tortilla maker has
announced that it will no longer purchase GM corn.
</P>
<P>
   American farmers find all this terribly frustrating. Hysteria,
they say, has replaced science. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 200 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 525) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Seed companies, such as Monsanto, have been ineffective in
defending their new technology; some governments are using the
biotechnology issue as an excuse for protectionism;
environmentalists are attacking GM products even though some of
them reduce the need for conventional pesticides and herbicides.
</P>
<P>
   But only one pressure group really matters to farmers. When it
comes to deciding what to plant this spring, ``the consumer is
king,'' says Neil Harl, an agricultural economist at Iowa State
University.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest consumer of all, both literally and figuratively, is
American.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there is no evidence of a widespread backlash in the
United States against GM products. (Although ``organic'' standards
in America are supposed to exclude GM products, one organic food
store in Washington, D.C., happily offers fruit and vegetables
``grown without pesticides'' which, in fact, have been genetically
modified not to need them.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are small signs that should give farmers pause. In
November, a bill was introduced in Congress that would require
labelling for GM products.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue Chicken, one of America's largest poultry producers, is
positioning itself not to use any GM feed, says Harl. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A farmer with a crop six weeks in the ground may well fear that
he will wake up and read that a large American fast-food company
will no longer buy beef that has been fed GM corn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the crop's in the ground, you know, you can't back it
up,'' says Roger Janssen, an Illinois seed dealer: you are stuck
with it, like it or not. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 100 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 800) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Farmers bear the bulk of the risk as consumers sort out what
they want. Food processors do not have to commit themselves to a
price until the crop comes in.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Archer Daniels Midland, one of America's largest
food-processing firms, says the market is a ``moving target.''
</P>
<P>
   Cargill said in a December letter that it will buy whatever
American farmers grow this year, but noted that premiums may be
paid ``for identity-preserved grains and oilseeds (i.e., any grains
and oilseeds that have been handled separately from the bulk) that
meet specific customer requirements.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With farm prices at historic lows, the premium paid for growing
the right crop might mean the difference between making money and
not making money (or between losing a little money and losing a
lot).
</P>
<P>
   Baumgardner says his GM corn yielded 30 more bushels per acre
last year than the non-GM corn he planted. Still, he plans to trim
his GM corn this year from 70 percent of his acreage to 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Tamara White, director of commodities for the Illinois Farm
Bureau, travels around the state discussing the issue with farmers.
``Each week more people are deciding that they're not going to risk
it,'' she says. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM _ 175 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,000) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The American Corn Growers Association has predicted a 20-25
percent reduction in GM corn acreage. But picking the right crop to
grow is only the beginning of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to say, `We want all GMO-free products.' It's
another thing to deliver,'' says Baumgardner.
</P>
<P>
   All crops, conventional or GM, contaminate one another. Pollen
can drift a quarter of a mile or more; one farmer's GM crop can
cross-pollinate his neighbor's.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers selling non-GM grains are asked to certify the purity of
their product at the point of sale; they fear being held liable for
grain contaminated in storage, in transit, or at other points in
the supply chain.
</P>
<P>
   The only solution is testing for purity at every point in the
supply chain, says Harl. Even then, some level of impurity must be
tolerable.
</P>
<P>
   Experts reckon a 5 percent tolerance for contamination is
feasible; the 1 percent level discussed in the EU, or the 0.1
percent level under discussion in Congress and among certain
European retail groups, may be too costly. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,275) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One possible result is that the current generation of GM
products will be driven off the farm, not because they are unsafe
or ineffective but because the costs of segregating them are too
high.
</P>
<P>
   The next generation may fare differently. By then, GM crops may
well have properties (say, medical, nutritional, or even
industrial) that will be of greater interest to consumers, and the
cost of segregating them could be passed on in the final price.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Baumgardner and his colleagues will just have to
hang on. &QL;

defending their new technology; some governments are using the
biotechnology issue as an excuse for protectionism;

American.

   So far, there is no evidence of a widespread backlash in the
United States against GM products. (Although ``organic'' standards
in America are supposed to exclude GM products, one organic food
store in Washington, D.C., happily offers fruit and vegetables
``grown without pesticides'' which, in fact, have been genetically
modified not to need them.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are small signs that should give farmers pause. In
November, a bill was introduced in Congress that would require
labelling for GM products.
</P>

   The American Corn Growers Association has predicted a 20-25
percent reduction in GM corn acreage. But picking the right crop to
grow is only the beginning of the problem.

<P>
   ``It's one thing to say, `We want all GMO-free products.' It's

</P>
<P>
   All crops, conventional or GM, contaminate one another. Pollen
can drift a quarter of a mile or more; one farmer's GM crop can
cross-pollinate his neighbor's.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers selling non-GM grains are asked to certify the purity of
their product at the point of sale; they fear being held liable for
grain contaminated in storage, in transit, or at other points in
the supply chain.
</P>
<P>
   The only solution is testing for purity at every point in the
supply chain, says Harl. Even then, some level of impurity must be
tolerable.
</P>
<P>
   Experts reckon a 5 percent tolerance for contamination is
feasible; the 1 percent level discussed in the EU, or the 0.1
percent level under discussion in Congress and among certain
European retail groups, may be too costly. &QL;

   One possible result is that the current generation of GM
products will be driven off the farm, not because they are unsafe
or ineffective but because the costs of segregating them are too
high.
</P>
<P>
   The next generation may fare differently. By then, GM crops may
well have properties (say, medical, nutritional, or even
industrial) that will be of greater interest to consumers, and the
cost of segregating them could be passed on in the final price.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Baumgardner and his colleagues will just have to
hang on. &QL;

<P>
   CHICAGO _ January should be a quiet time for Midwestern farmers.
Instead, they find themselves facing one of the hardest farming
decisions of the year: should they risk putting genetically
modified (GM) crops in the ground, or not?
</P>
<P>
   For some, the agronomics are easy; they believe that GM products
expand yields and lower costs.
</P>
<P>
   But if American consumers were to become suddenly concerned
about ``Frankenstein foods,'' as some Asians and Europeans already
have, then, come the autumn, farmers may be sitting on a bountiful
harvest that has lost much of its value.
</P>
<P>
   For a farmer like Darl Baumgardner, who grows maize (corn) and
soybeans in Illinois, there is much to like about GM crops.
</P>
<P>
   Bt corn, for example, uses a gene derived from a soil bacterium,
Bacillus thuringiensis, to make the whole corn plant toxic to the
corn-borer, a caterpillar that drills into the corn cob and
destroys the crop.
</P>
<P>
   Herbicide-resistant soybeans are engineered to be immune to a
powerful herbicide that will kill all other vegetation on the
cropland, making it easier for farmers to get rid of weeds.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, it is hardly surprising that the percentage of
American soybean acreage planted with GM soybeans grew to over 50
percent in the four years after commercial introduction, an
adoption rate nearly twice as fast as that for the most dominant
agricultural technology of the past, hybrid corn.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Kalaitzandonakes, a professor of agribusiness at the
University of Missouri who has done those calculations, also
reckons that the benefits to farmers of GM soybean technology alone
were in the order of $400 million-$1 billion in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   When your correspondent drove into the heartland two years ago,
farmers were effusive about the potential of biotechnology.
Consumers, particularly those outside the United States, have not
been so keen on the idea.
</P>
<P>
   There is no credible evidence yet that GM foods present a health
risk to consumers. But the European Union has withheld approval of
some GM crop varieties until exhaustive trials are done, and many
Europeans have decided that they would rather not buy those
products that have been approved. Some large supermarket chains
have refused to stock the stuff.
</P>
<P>
   The EU allows GM soybeans, but it is increasingly looking to
non-GM suppliers, such as Brazil, and to alternative ingredients.
As a result, American soybean exports to the EU have plunged from
398 million bushels in 1997-98 to an estimated 221 million bushels
in 1999-2000.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Wisner, an Iowa State University economist, reckons this is
the equivalent of losing a market for one out of every three
bushels of soybeans grown in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the problem just in Europe. Both Japan and Korea have
announced plans to begin labelling certain GM commodities
(unprocessed corn and soybeans) in the spring of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   A prominent Japanese soy-sauce manufacturer announced in
December that it would use non-GM soybeans in the future.
</P>
<P>
   South of the border, Mexico's largest tortilla maker has
announced that it will no longer purchase GM corn.
</P>
<P>
   American farmers find all this terribly frustrating. Hysteria,
they say, has replaced science. &QL;

INVESTIGATORS THINK FIREWORKS, CHEMICALS CAUSED KC HOUSE
EXPLOSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN UHLENHUTH  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The fatal explosion that rattled a south Kansas City
neighborhood Saturday evening was tripped by a basement stash of
fireworks and the chemicals used in their manufacture, a spokesman
for the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms said Sunday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have not identified the victim, whose body was
pulled from the debris of a house at 1112 E. 77th Terrace about 11
a.m. Sunday. The house exploded about 5:30 p.m. Saturday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The body could not be removed until an ATF investigator arrived
from Chicago to identify what chemicals remained in the basement.
Authorities were concerned about potential harm they posed for
personnel at the scene from the Kansas City police and fire
departments, the ATF and the Environmental Protection Agency. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The identity of the victim and the cause of death won't be
determined until after an autopsy and examination of dental records
or X-rays, which probably will be done today, said Tom Hensley, an
investigator for the Jackson County medical examiner. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The force of the blast was apparent Sunday afternoon. Boards and
other bits of wreckage were lodged in the topmost limbs of a tree,
perhaps 100 feet tall, that overhangs the collapsed house. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other boards and shingles ripped from their moorings were found
as far as three blocks away. Windows were blown out of many houses
in the same area. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The series of explosions _ one neighbor reported hearing three _
also heavily damaged the house next door, which was then destroyed
by fire. The occupants, Calvin Barber and his mother, Edith Barber,
received minor head injuries and were staying with relatives Sunday
night. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No damage estimate has been compiled. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although investigators had not determined why the victim had
commercial-grade fireworks and related chemicals in his basement,
one neighbor said he believed the man was in the fireworks
business. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pages from ``American Fireworks News'' and order forms for
explosives littered a yard just behind the flattened house on
Sunday. Also amid the burned and soggy clutter were a
computer-aided design instruction manual and a copy of the magazine
``Log Home Living.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also warned residents in the neighborhood to be on
the lookout for debris in their yards that could be dangerous. They
were especially concerned about commercial fireworks,
high-intensity explosives that are used in municipal fireworks
displays. They found several such devices in the victim's yard and
one on a neighboring property a short distance away. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ATF spokesman Larry Scott said anyone finding such devices
should not handle them and should immediately notify authorities. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Keeping such explosives in one's home is illegal, Scott said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Workers for the Environmental Protection Agency removed several
drums of explosive chemicals from the basement. Although the
chemicals found on the premises are not difficult to purchase,
Scott said it is illegal _ and extremely dangerous _ to store them
in a residential area. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't realize the damage it could do,'' Scott said.
``Static electricity can set it off. Heat, friction, any open
flame. We can't wear nylon clothes when we deal with this stuff
because of the static electricity buildup. It's so
unpredictable.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The victim was practically unknown to his neighbors. Wallace
Tillman, who lives a few houses away, thought the man was about 40
years old and was employed as a welder. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``When I cut the grass, I'd see him welding back there,''
Tillman said. He remembered seeing the victim welding a section of
pipe and assumed it was part of the improvements he was making to
the house. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The victim had lived in the house for about a year, according to
the Rev. Toby Gray, another neighbor. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The day after the blast, neighbors were in varying states of
distress and dislocation. Shards of glass lay in the front yard of
a house across the street where Robert Shaw lives. Windows in the
living room and several bedrooms had been blown out, and one
visitor inside huddled under blankets to counter the cold. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shaw said he will stay with his grandmother until the windows
are replaced. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rosie Ross Reaves lives behind the destroyed house. Reaves had
just returned from a movie Saturday evening and was mostly
undressed when the first blast shook her and cut the electricity
off. Then came the second explosion, and Reaves suddenly saw fire
all around outside. Not sure if the explosions were from without or
within, she was uncertain where to go. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A third blast hurled objects out of cabinets and caused pictures
to fall off the walls. Reaves grabbed a robe and shoes and ran
outside. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the daylight Sunday, she said her house looked surprisingly
habitable. But she wasn't planning to move back in just yet. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still in shock.'' &QL;

   PARIS _ Imperious, opaque and unforgiving, the Michelin Guide
seems hopelessly out of touch with the times. Yet the plump red
book with Michelin's mascot emblazoned on the cover turns 100 this
year with its status as the gastronomic world's bible firmly
intact.
</P>
<P>
   While rival guides appear regularly, none has yet been able to
generate anything like the frisson of excitement that greets
Michelin's annual arrival _ scheduled this year for Feb. 29.
</P>
<P>
   On that day, as always, champagne will flow in some French
kitchens while souffles fall in others.
</P>
<P>
   The power of Michelin's coveted stars, first introduced in 1926,
to make or break culinary reputations is undiminished.
Restaurateurs who reach the top of the Michelin pecking order (a
three-star rating) live in fear of falling off.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure gets much worse once you earn the third star
because people then expect perfection,'' says Jean-Claude Vrinat,
the owner of Taillevent, a three-star establishment since 1973.
</P>
<P>
   He reckons the loss of its third star would reduce Taillevent's
turnover by as much as 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of a third star caused little less than a national
sensation in 1997, the year that Alain Ducasse, who already had
three stars to his name at Monte Carlo's Louis XV restaurant, was
pursuing the same distinction at the eponymous restaurant he had
recently opened in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   To the shock of peers and fans alike, Ducasse received top
honors for his new venture but was stripped of a star in Monte
Carlo. No reason was given for the lower mark; the guide never
explains its actions.

classical preparations _ ``la cuisine de musee'' as it is

stifling creativity.

<P>
   Few of these claims, however, stand up to close scrutiny. For a

<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Imperious, opaque and unforgiving, the Michelin Guide
seems hopelessly out of touch with the times. Yet the plump red
book with Michelin's mascot emblazoned on the cover turns 100 this
year with its status as the gastronomic world's bible firmly
intact.
</P>
<P>
   While rival guides appear regularly, none has yet been able to
generate anything like the frisson of excitement that greets
Michelin's annual arrival _ scheduled this year for Feb. 29.
</P>
<P>
   On that day, as always, champagne will flow in some French
kitchens while souffles fall in others.
</P>
<P>
   The power of Michelin's coveted stars, first introduced in 1926,
to make or break culinary reputations is undiminished.
Restaurateurs who reach the top of the Michelin pecking order (a
three-star rating) live in fear of falling off.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure gets much worse once you earn the third star
because people then expect perfection,'' says Jean-Claude Vrinat,
the owner of Taillevent, a three-star establishment since 1973.
</P>
<P>
   He reckons the loss of its third star would reduce Taillevent's
turnover by as much as 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of a third star caused little less than a national
sensation in 1997, the year that Alain Ducasse, who already had
three stars to his name at Monte Carlo's Louis XV restaurant, was
pursuing the same distinction at the eponymous restaurant he had
recently opened in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   To the shock of peers and fans alike, Ducasse received top
honors for his new venture but was stripped of a star in Monte
Carlo. No reason was given for the lower mark; the guide never
explains its actions.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from a short list of specialities and a range of prices,
restaurants are described only in terms of stars and crossed
utensils (a measure of service and ambience).
</P>
<P>
   Ask how many inspectors the guide employs and you are told, ``A
certain number.'' Are there women among them? ``Some.''
</P>
<P>
   And how often will Michelin call on a restaurant before
assigning it a grade? To which the reply is that favorite French

discreet tongues.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Anyone who has ever hired a builder knows that even
the simplest job tends to be plagued by cost overruns and delays.
And the bigger the project, the bigger the problems: according to
one estimate, inefficiencies, mistakes and delays account for $200
billion of the $650 billion spent on construction in America every
year.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to see why. A building project, whether it is a hotel
or a cement plant, involves dozens of businesses _ architects,
engineers, material suppliers _ working together for month or
years. Each project entails thousands of transactions, all of them
currently recorded on paper.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Everyone involved from the architect to the carpenters can then
have access to this site to check blueprints and orders, change
specifications and agree delivery dates. Moreover, everything from
due dates to material specifications is permanently recorded.
</P>
<P>
   Clients love this approach. Harlan Kelly, city engineer at the
city of San Francisco, says Bidcom has cut project time by six
months: ``We can do things quicker, faster and better and there are
fewer arguments about whether information has reached people.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Kuffner, Northern California business manager for
Swinerton &AMP; Walberg Builders, a large contractor, says that using
Bidcom has reduced by two-thirds the time needed to deal with
requests for information.
</P>
<P>
   Such endorsements have helped the group to attract some
blue-chip investors. On Jan. 11 Bidcom raised $46 million from,
among others, GE Capital, Oracle and Internet Capital Group, a
venture-capitalist group which owns 25 percent of the stock and is
likely to push for an early public offering.
</P>
<P>
   BuildNet _ which focuses on residential rather than commercial
construction and raised $105 million this month from investors
including Kaufman and Broad, America's biggest home builder _ takes
a different approach.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than set up Web sites for specific projects, its software
integrates the back-office systems of builders and suppliers, in
the same way that modern supermarkets and their suppliers are
linked.
</P>
<P>
   While there is some loss of flexibility _ a new supplier cannot
quickly be brought into a project _ efficiencies are potentially
huge as materials are delivered just in time and automatically,
cutting out human error and cost in the ordering process.
</P>
<P>
   Both of these companies aim to be much broader than mere
software providers. They are turning themselves into fully fledged
business-to-business Internet hubs that start by amassing content
(news, prices, gossip, job opportunities) tailored to their
industry, to draw buyers and sellers to their sites.
</P>
<P>
   Once enough are online to create liquidity, the hub turns into a
marketplace, cutting out traditional middlemen and taking a
commission from the transactions it hosts.
</P>
<P>
   The scale economies are potentially enormous. Mohanbir Sawhney,
professor of e-commerce at Kellogg School of Management and Steven
Kaplan, at the University of Chicago Business School, argue in a
recent article that the value created by business-to-business hubs,
where every buyer and seller can potentially link with every other,
vastly exceeds that of business-to-consumer models where there are
lots of buyers, but just one seller.
</P>
<P>
   The fragmented construction industry needs such a marketplace.
Unless people start living in virtual buildings, there will always
be plenty of bricks and mortar to trade. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ Anyone who has ever hired a builder knows that even
the simplest job tends to be plagued by cost overruns and delays.
And the bigger the project, the bigger the problems: according to
one estimate, inefficiencies, mistakes and delays account for $200
billion of the $650 billion spent on construction in America every
year.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to see why. A building project, whether it is a hotel
or a cement plant, involves dozens of businesses _ architects,
engineers, material suppliers _ working together for month or
years. Each project entails thousands of transactions, all of them
currently recorded on paper.
</P>

orders, requests for information and schedules. Project managers

DREAMS OF NAFTA TRADE CENTER RUN INTO DOUBTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ERIC PALMER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Interstate 35 cuts through America's heartland like a concrete
artery, connecting Mexico with Canada. Local business executives
have dubbed it the NAFTA highway, invoking the multinational trade
agreement. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The highway lies at the center of efforts to make Kansas City an
inland international port. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Greater Kansas City Chamber of Commerce is pushing to create
a high-technology import/export facility that would allow trucks
and trains to bypass border crossings and get processed in Kansas
City. The area is seeking $1.2 million in federal funds to design
the center and the technology it would use. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Mid-America Regional Council, meanwhile, has snagged $1
million in federal funds to investigate how the six states
connected by I-35 can expedite trade by using computers to
communicate with truckers about road conditions and the contents
and safety of their loads. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But for all the time, money and energy being put into making the
I-35 corridor into a primary international trade route,
transportation and trade experts say it faces some doubts about its
potential. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, they say most of I-35 is outside the North American
Free Trade Agreement's trade mainstream. And that makes I-35 a hard
sell to receive scarce federal funds for the $10.6 billion in
improvements, needed mostly in Texas, to move traffic and trade
efficiently along the highway. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``When you factor in trade around the world, it mostly moves
between centers of population and centers of manufacturing,'' said
John McCray, a professor and transportation consultant from the
University of Texas at San Antonio. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Where are the centers in the U.S.? A third of the population
lives in the 13 original colonies. If you fly over Kansas City on
your way to Seattle, you see the lights go out pretty quickly.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Trucks carry the vast majority of trade with Mexico. And
research McCray did based on 1996 traffic showed that most of the
truck freight generated by NAFTA trade flows from Texas to the
northeast. His work was incorporated in a study by Kansas-City
based HNTB Architects Engineers Planners that pinpointed the
improvements I-35 needs to be an efficient trade corridor. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Kansas City shouldn't be interested in
international trade, McCray said _ but the hard work is in getting
U.S. and Mexican businesspeople together to forge deals. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The greatest potential comes from developing service and
information jobs, McCray said. Intellectual property doesn't move
by truck or train. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I would rather be the finance and insurance center than the
distribution center,'' McCray said. ``All trucks are, are
pollution.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Promoters of the potential of Interstate 35 and a
trade-processing center here are undeterred. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Doug Luciani at the Kansas City chamber gets exasperated by the
``mind-set'' of the trade bureaucracy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You will see studies that appear to confirm what has always
been,'' he said. ``Two hundred years of history show goods go where
the most people live, and always will, but that doesn't mean there
isn't a better way to move some of those goods.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not only has Kansas City's economic history been shaped by
transportation, said Kansas City transportation consultant Michael
Webber _ its future depends on it. The city's location for moving
goods is its most compelling competitive advantage, he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Not everyone in Kansas City will work in transportation, but
everyone will work here because of transportation,'' said Webber,
with TranSystems Corp., which headed a study evaluating the
potential for the trade-processing center concept. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that I-35 between Mexico and Dallas is one
of the busiest NAFTA trade routes in the United States. The problem
for Kansas City is that only a smidgen of that trade continues
north of Dallas along I-35. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 135 trucks a day move international trade between
Dallas and Kansas City. But 10 times that much moves from Dallas to
Nashville, Tenn. And much of what doesn't get siphoned off at
Dallas is siphoned in Oklahoma, onto Interstate 44. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The HNTB study predicts that by 2025, Kansas' share will have
grown to 610 trucks a day. That compares with the 1,400 trucks a
day moving between Dallas and Nashville _ today. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Webber said that looking at existing NAFTA traffic misses
the point. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about getting freight from Mexico to Atlanta,'' he
said. It is about capturing increased shipments to and from the 10
or 12 states around Missouri to Mexico and Canada. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If Kansas City doesn't make the investments needed to get this
growing trade, boosters say, other cities will. Then the area will
not only miss an opportunity to grow, it will face losing the trade
it now gets and the benefits that provides. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is a common scenario in cities with strong shipping,
Webber said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``First you get a 15-person call center for a company,'' he
said. ``Then that becomes a 75-person distribution center, then a
150-person assembly center, then a 250-person manufacturing center,
then a bigger manufacturing center.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Technology will make processing goods in the Midwest cheaper and
more efficient than at congested border stops and deep-water ports,
Luciani said. If some of the goods can move through those sticking
points unfettered and be inspected and unloaded in places like
Kansas City, it will serve as a safety valve on the ports and
benefit places like Kansas City. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't prove it, because we haven't done it yet,'' Luciani
said. ``I know I sound defensive. We run into these arguments
frequently, particularly at the federal level.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While officials here concede that highway funds are getting more
difficult to snag, they point out that Kansas City has hitched its
concept to U.S. efforts to use technology to streamline the export
paperwork mess. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shippers fill out separate forms for the U.S. Customs Service,
the Food and Drug Administration and the Department of Agriculture.
The Treasury Department is developing a computer system that would
allow everything to be filed electronically. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Notably, the director of the Treasury office developing that
computer system, Robert W. Ehinger, has supported Kansas City's
plan, Luciani said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The chamber and other business groups like the idea of putting
some elements of the proposed trade-processing center at
Richards-Gebaur Memorial Airport to build off the increased NAFTA
trade that the Kansas City Southern Railway expects to move through
a new intermodal facility there. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Voters in August approved a plan for the city to close runways
and lease part of the airport to Kansas City Southern so it can
build a larger intermodal truck-and-train loading facility. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City Southern's system connects with the interior of
Mexico through Laredo, Texas. The intermodal facility deal has been
delayed for months by opposition, but the airport was closed Jan.
9, and construction is expected to begin soon. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Robert Harrison, an economist at the University of Texas at
Austin, said Kansas City's rail facilities should help it attract
more trade to and from Mexico. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Harrison, who is doing research on inland ports, said about 75
percent to 80 percent of trade from Mexico moves by truck, because
Mexico doesn't have the infrastructure to handle freight containers
that can be moved by truck, train or ship. He predicts that will
change and that Kansas City's rail facilities could then expect
more Mexican trade. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   However, McCray said the ``if we build it, they will come''
argument makes him nervous. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``These deals are almost completely driven by political
interests,'' McCray said. ``I would only do I-35 and a business
center if businesspeople say they want it. It is the business
players who create economic development.'' &QL;

IRANIAN-AMERICANS HAD PLENTY TO CHEER ABOUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ They've followed their team from afar for the
past few years, ever hopeful (but never fully convinced) they'd see
a day like this. Sunday, all their illusions became astonishingly
real.
</P>
<P>
   Years of darkness and then this: Their dream developing like a
vibrant Polaroid picture as they watched entranced, the twinkle in
their eyes, the gleam of nostalgia and, yes, perhaps a little
longing, too.
</P>
<P>
   Rams fans weren't the only ones who found pride and conciliation
on the football field Sunday. At roughly the same time the Rams,
formerly of L.A. and Anaheim, were in St. Louis cruising to their
first playoff win over Minnesota since 1978, many expatriate
Iranians were at the Rose Bowl, getting their first glimpse of the
Iranian national team since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
   If thousands of Iranian-Americans weren't bashful about wearing
the old or new Iranian flags as their sleeves, it was
understandable. If they rooted without reserve for Khodadad Azizi
and Hadi Tabatebei and Mehdi Mahdavikia, they weren't being
ungrateful.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in cheering for the Iranian team, they were rooting also
for the freedoms they've found (at no small cost) in the U.S. For
so many Iranian-Americans, it was as if they came for therapy and
an entertaining soccer match broke out.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of 50,181 ringed the Rose Bowl to watch the Iranians and
the U.S. national team play to a 1-1 tie in a friendly that was
just that. It was more polite than political, more mirthful than
militant.
</P>
<P>
   The black-gloved salute Iranian-Americans were urged to give
during the Iranian national anthem to protest the governing Islamic
regime appeared to have fallen on mostly deaf ears.
</P>
<P>
   Ditto the pleas of critics of the Iranian government to refrain
from waving any flag save the ones being handed out at the
entrances that consisted of the American flag on one side and the
pre-revolution Iranian flag on the other.
</P>
<P>
   It was as though Iranian-Americans felt they were making a
powerful statement with their mere presence. They came, they
cheered, they celebrated the triumph of the human spirit over
hatred.
</P>
<P>
   There were so many of them, it ticked off U.S. coach Bruce
Arena. ``We need to start getting behind soccer in this country,''
he said. ``It's disappointing we didn't have more people out here
supporting the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what happens in this country when soccer is pitched as a
mere game.
</P>
<P>
   Iranian-Americans clearly saw it as something more. So it
shouldn't have been surprising that the crowd was so conspicuously
tilted in the visiting team's favor, the Iranians seemed to be
running downhill most of the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Their counter-attacking style had the U.S. players on their
heels for most of the first half. Mahdavikia accepted a beautiful
pass from Azizi and swooped in on goalkeeper Brad Friedel in the
seventh minute. Friedel futilely tried to stop the shot _ he would
have had a better chance of stopping the intermittent raindrops _
and just like that the Iranians were leading in more than the crowd
count.
</P>
<P>
   The fans' loyalties, it should be said, were like those
two-sided flags so many of them were holding in their laps. They
loudly saluted the six acrobatic stops the Iranian goalkeeper,
Tabatabei, made but also cheered appreciatively for the shot that
got away. That would be the one Chris Armas booted with his left
foot off the cross from Cobi Jones in the third minute of the
second half to even the score.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their fans were very nice. They seemed to be cheering both
teams,'' U.S. captain Claudio Reyna said. ``It was a very nice
atmosphere to play in.''
</P>
<P>
   The 26-year-old Reyna is too young to remember when
Iranian-American relations were downright toxic. He was 6 when the
U.S. severed diplomatic ties with Iran after students seized the
U.S. embassy in Teheran and took hostages on Nov. 4, 1979.
</P>
<P>
   He can't remember, as we do, students on college campuses openly
questioning why their Iranian classmates were allowed to remain in
their midst. Unlike so many of the fans in the stands, Reyna had
neither heard the hatred nor felt the tension of that time.
</P>
<P>
   So it was easy for Reyna to blithely ignore the bigger picture
that the snapshot of Iranian and American players posing together
before the match represented.
</P>
<P>
   The political import of the match _ the first of its kind to be
held on U.S. soil since 1979 _ ``was never mentioned once all
week,'' Reyna said.
</P>
<P>
   It's a pity, that. After all, the first step toward grasping
history is recognizing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't concern ourselves with the politics,'' Arena said.
``If it helps promote peace in this world, terrific.''
</P>
<P>
   If head coach Mansour Pourhaidari had any real diplomatic pull,
he'd have extended an invitation to the U.S. to play in Iran.
``Obviously I can't say `yes' or `no' '', he said of turning the
happening into a home-and-home series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope there is a return game,'' he added, ``so we can beat
them better than the last time.''
</P>
<P>
   Pourhaidari was laughing as he said that. The day was about
mending bad feelings, after all, not creating new animosities.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, the next question didn't wipe the smile from
Pourhaidari's face. Did he think he would have been fired if Iran
had lost the game?
</P>
<P>
   For some people, obviously, diplomacy extends only so far. &QL;

   PARIS _ Imperious, opaque and unforgiving, the Michelin Guide
seems hopelessly out of touch with the times. Yet the plump red
book with Michelin's mascot emblazoned on the cover turns 100 this
year with its status as the gastronomic world's bible firmly
intact.
</P>
<P>
   While rival guides appear regularly, none has yet been able to
generate anything like the frisson of excitement that greets
Michelin's annual arrival _ scheduled this year for Feb. 29.
</P>
<P>
   On that day, as always, champagne will flow in some French
kitchens while souffles fall in others.
</P>
<P>
   The power of Michelin's coveted stars, first introduced in 1926,
to make or break culinary reputations is undiminished.
Restaurateurs who reach the top of the Michelin pecking order (a
three-star rating) live in fear of falling off.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure gets much worse once you earn the third star
because people then expect perfection,'' says Jean-Claude Vrinat,
the owner of Taillevent, a three-star establishment since 1973.
</P>
<P>
   He reckons the loss of its third star would reduce Taillevent's
turnover by as much as 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of a third star caused little less than a national
sensation in 1997, the year that Alain Ducasse, who already had
three stars to his name at Monte Carlo's Louis XV restaurant, was
pursuing the same distinction at the eponymous restaurant he had
recently opened in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   To the shock of peers and fans alike, Ducasse received top
honors for his new venture but was stripped of a star in Monte
Carlo. No reason was given for the lower mark; the guide never
explains its actions.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from a short list of specialities and a range of prices,
restaurants are described only in terms of stars and crossed
utensils (a measure of service and ambience).
</P>
<P>
   Ask how many inspectors the guide employs and you are told, ``A
certain number.'' Are there women among them? ``Some.''
</P>
<P>
   And how often will Michelin call on a restaurant before
assigning it a grade? To which the reply is that favorite French
conversation stopper, ``Ca depend.''
</P>
<P>
   A few scraps are thrown to the curious: all inspectors are said
to be drawn from the hospitality industry, all work full-time for
Michelin, and all are required to have both refined palates and
discreet tongues.
</P>
<P>
   Secrecy is paramount: each inspector dines alone and
anonymously, pays just one visit to a restaurant, and is rotated
from region to region every several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Michelin's reticence gives its critics fits. In their view, its
refusal to shed light on its decisions suggests a smug contempt for
the dining public.
</P>
<P>
   There are other gripes too: the guide is considered slow to
acknowledge new restaurants and trends; its inspectors are thought
to be partial to plush settings, obliging proprietors to spend
lavish sums of money on decoration and pushing up prices; and it
allegedly saves its highest praise for restaurants turning out
classical preparations _ ``la cuisine de musee'' as it is
derisively known _ discouraging chefs from experimenting and
stifling creativity.
</P>
<P>
   Few of these claims, however, stand up to close scrutiny. For a
start, given the ingredients that typically adorn a three-star menu
_ foie gras, caviar, the finest fish and the choicest cuts of meat
_ eating at a top-rated establishment would empty most wallets
regardless of the setting.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, people who are prepared to fork out hundreds
of dollars for lunch or dinner expect their surroundings to be at
least as sumptuous as their food.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is there much evidence that the guide is keeping French food
tethered to the past. Taillevent, a temple of traditional cooking
in Paris, boasts three stars, but so does the exuberantly eclectic
chef, Pierre Gagnaire.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1997, the guide awarded three stars to the country
bumpkin of haute cuisine, Michel Bras, who among other things
encourages guests at his remote restaurant in southwestern France
to use the same knife and fork throughout the meal.
</P>
<P>
   Michelin also does an able job keeping tabs on the shifting food
scene.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the growing appetite for ethnic fare, particularly in
Paris, it has ladled out stars to Vietnamese, Chinese, and North
African restaurants. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (100-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 700) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, it no longer limits itself to France. It now issues
guides to a dozen European countries, and while its annual ratings
may not inspire quite the same feverish speculation in Pisa as they
do in Paris, Michelin stars, wherever bestowed, shine in food
circles like a well-glazed sweetmeat.
</P>
<P>
   Were it not for the three stars awarded to El Bulli, for
example, would bon vivants be flocking to Spain's Costa Brava to
sample the comically unorthodox dishes of chef Ferran Adria, dubbed
``the Salvador Dali of the kitchen?'' Unlikely. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 975) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A high mark from Michelin, however, is no longer the guarantee
of commercial success that it once was. Although there are
currently 21 three-star restaurants in France, the most that there
have ever been, many of them are struggling.
</P>
<P>
   Gagnaire, for example, is on his second set of three stars; he
was forced to give up the first trio when his restaurant in St.
Etienne went bankrupt in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   More telling still is the drop in France's overall number of
starred eateries. In 1984, there were 642; last year, just 500.
</P>
<P>
   Falling standards in the kitchen are partly to blame; but a
bigger factor has been France's economic malaise. While a strong
international clientele helps keep most three-stars afloat, one-
and two-star establishments play mainly to the home audience. And
many French diners have recently had neither the money nor the
inclination to splurge on fancy meals.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the belt-tightening, last year Michelin
introduced a new category, ``Bib Gourmand,'' consisting of
restaurants that offer good meals and good value.
</P>
<P>
   As always, the guide thrives by subtly reflecting the shifting
fortunes of France herself. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Anyone who has ever hired a builder knows that even
the simplest job tends to be plagued by cost overruns and delays.
And the bigger the project, the bigger the problems: according to
one estimate, inefficiencies, mistakes and delays account for $200
billion of the $650 billion spent on construction in America every
year.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to see why. A building project, whether it is a hotel
or a cement plant, involves dozens of businesses _ architects,
engineers, material suppliers _ working together for month or
years. Each project entails thousands of transactions, all of them
currently recorded on paper.
</P>
<P>
   A typical $100 million building project generates 150,000
separate documents: technical drawings, legal contracts, purchase
orders, requests for information and schedules. Project managers
build warehouses just to store them.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Express reputedly garnered $500 million last year just
shipping blueprints across America.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, construction is a slow affair, regularly held up by
building regulations, stroppy unions and bad weather. Owners,
architects and engineers must physically visit sites.
</P>
<P>
   With everything still done by fax or telephone, requests for the
size of a roof tile can take weeks and seemingly minor changes can
lead to long delays as bits of paper wind through approval
processes.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, mistakes are common. Wrong supplies arrive and bills
go unpaid. Given onerous shipping costs and the high value of
commercial contracts, mistakes matter. Building is one of the
world's most litigious industries.
</P>
<P>
   Help is at hand.
</P>
<P>
   A group of new business-to-business companies plan to turn all
construction into an efficient virtual process.
</P>
<P>
   Daryl Magana, chief executive of Bidcom, says his company
creates a separate Web site for every building project for clients
including the city of San Francisco, The Gap and General Electric.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone involved from the architect to the carpenters can then
have access to this site to check blueprints and orders, change
specifications and agree delivery dates. Moreover, everything from
due dates to material specifications is permanently recorded.
</P>
<P>
   Clients love this approach. Harlan Kelly, city engineer at the
city of San Francisco, says Bidcom has cut project time by six
months: ``We can do things quicker, faster and better and there are
fewer arguments about whether information has reached people.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Kuffner, Northern California business manager for
Swinerton &AMP; Walberg Builders, a large contractor, says that using
Bidcom has reduced by two-thirds the time needed to deal with
requests for information.
</P>
<P>
   Such endorsements have helped the group to attract some
blue-chip investors. On Jan. 11 Bidcom raised $46 million from,
among others, GE Capital, Oracle and Internet Capital Group, a
venture-capitalist group which owns 25 percent of the stock and is
likely to push for an early public offering.
</P>
<P>
   BuildNet _ which focuses on residential rather than commercial
construction and raised $105 million this month from investors
including Kaufman and Broad, America's biggest home builder _ takes
a different approach.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than set up Web sites for specific projects, its software
integrates the back-office systems of builders and suppliers, in
the same way that modern supermarkets and their suppliers are
linked.
</P>
<P>
   While there is some loss of flexibility _ a new supplier cannot
quickly be brought into a project _ efficiencies are potentially
huge as materials are delivered just in time and automatically,
cutting out human error and cost in the ordering process.
</P>
<P>
   Both of these companies aim to be much broader than mere
software providers. They are turning themselves into fully fledged
business-to-business Internet hubs that start by amassing content
(news, prices, gossip, job opportunities) tailored to their
industry, to draw buyers and sellers to their sites.
</P>
<P>
   Once enough are online to create liquidity, the hub turns into a
marketplace, cutting out traditional middlemen and taking a
commission from the transactions it hosts.
</P>
<P>
   The scale economies are potentially enormous. Mohanbir Sawhney,
professor of e-commerce at Kellogg School of Management and Steven
Kaplan, at the University of Chicago Business School, argue in a
recent article that the value created by business-to-business hubs,
where every buyer and seller can potentially link with every other,
vastly exceeds that of business-to-consumer models where there are
lots of buyers, but just one seller.
</P>
<P>
   The fragmented construction industry needs such a marketplace.
Unless people start living in virtual buildings, there will always
be plenty of bricks and mortar to trade. &QL;
