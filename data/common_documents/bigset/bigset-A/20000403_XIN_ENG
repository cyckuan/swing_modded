<P>
DHAKA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh Sunday celebrated the
International Cricket Week from April 2 to 8 designated by the
International Cricket Council (ICC) to be observed all over the
world in association with the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The celebrations were kicked off with a colorful rally in Dhaka
city at 8 AM, which ended at the Bangbandhu National Stadium, the
venue for a match between Asia XI and World XI on April 8th, the
closing day of the Week.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh, as a very prospective cricket-playing nation, earns
the ICC priority in its development program worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) is all set to make the most of
the occasion by holding different ICC-designed programs throughout
the week.
</P>
<P>
On April 3, Bangladesh will host a series of matches among the
under-10 cricketers. A quiz competition and a seminar on "Cricket,
Patriotism and Globalization" will be held on April 4. Extensive
development programs in six divisional headquarters and a painting
competition of the children will be held on April 6 and 7
respectively.
</P>
<P>
As part of its game's globalization drive, the ICC in
cooperation with the United Nations is holding various programs to
introduce cricket to new audiences around the world, as well as
providing entertainment for those familiar with the game.
</P>
<P>
In his message on the Week, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan
expressed his happiness to join cricket fans in celebrating
Cricket Week.
</P>
<P>
"We can share our joy in everything we love about the game: its
grace and subtlety, and the premium it puts on sportsmanship, team
spirit, and fair play," Annan said.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Blood-And-Tear Indictment Against Cult Activities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Feng Jian
</P>
<P>
KANUNGU, UGANDA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Lydia Bagambe, a
48-year-old widow in Kanungu, Uganda, is so ordinary-looking and
ordinarily dressed that she would not draw any attention, but she
is at the same time so extraordinary now because she is the
sister-in-law of the doomsday cult leader Credonia Mwerinde and
lost four children in the tragic church fire on March 17.
</P>
<P>
"She is a cruel devil, not at all an angel who can speak
directly with God. She kills so many people. I would tear her to
pieces if she appears before me," Lydia said about Mwerinde in an
interview with Xinhua in Kanungu county Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
With tears in her eyes, Lydia said that she lost three
daughters, aged 26, 24,23 respectively, and her only son in the
fire which she said could be nothing but a scheme.
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure it's designed to kill the members of the cult
Movement for the Restoration of Ten Commandments of God. She
forced my children into cult membership and did not allow them to
come back to me," she spoke in the local dialect.
</P>
<P>
"My children joined the cult very early. They eat very bad food
there. So they escaped to home. But their aunt forced them to go
back again. My son was in primary seven when he was taken to
their church and joined the cult. He dared not talk to me about
his sufferings in the camp for fear of his aunt who became the
head of the family after my husband's death in 1980s," Lydia's
voice trembled a bit when she spoke.
</P>
<P>
After rubbing her tears with an old handkerchief, she pointed
to a three- year-old baby on her lap and added:"This is the
three-year-old girl my 26- year-old daughter left behind. She was
six months pregnant when she died. I just don't know where is my
future," the middle-aged widow cast her eyes down onto the girl
who had been looking at me with so innocent eyes all the time I
chatted with her grandma.
</P>
<P>
When asked about whether Mwerinde tried to persuade her to join
the cult,
</P>
<P>
Lydia said that Mwerinde had tried several times to get her into
the cult but failed because she was a Protestant and would not
believe in the end of the world at the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
"However, my kids were young and were easily taken in. Like
many other kids playing there, my son was lovely and active and
did not know much about the world, but he was burnt to death," she
pointed to some boys playing football not far away. "This is my
kid," she added after showing me a yellowish photo of his son,"he
was denied schooling after joining the cult."
</P>
<P>
"My son once told me that there were many kids of his age in
the church. They were only allowed to take one cup of porridge
each day. Every time my son came back stealthily, I noticed he
became thinner and every time I shed silent tears for that. You
know what a mother would feel in this case, " she told me and the
large crowd around me.
</P>
<P>
When at last I asked what she thought of her sister-in-law,
Lydia said without any hesitation,"she is just a devil. She
killed so many people, innocent people. I would tear her to
pieces if she appears before me." She evidently raised her voice
when uttering the last sentence. "She would go to hell," she
cursed between her teeth.
</P>
<P>
When our talk ended, I once again noticed her tearful eyes and
the toddling girl standing beside her, waving her small tender
hand to me in
the afternoon chilly breeze.

<HEADLINE> GCC FMs Due to Meet on Regional Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) states are to meet in the western Saudi
city of Jeddah on April 8-9 to discuss a number of important
regional issues, a senior GCC official said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi issue and the consequences resulting from Baghdad's
refusal of the United Nations Resolution 1284 will be discussed,
GCC Secretary General Jamil Al-Hujailan said in a statement in the
Saudi capital of Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
He said the meeting will also follow up measures and steps taken
at the GCC summit in Riyadh last November to carry out an agreement
on setting up a customs union, which will come into effect on March
1, 2005.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was believed to be a critical decision in moving
toward the economic integration of the Gulf Arab states.
</P>
<P>
The summit also approved a unified legal system for customs and
changes to real estate ownership regulations.
</P>
<P>
Al-Hujailan said GCC foreign ministers will also review the
results of efforts made by a GCC committee formed to map out a
mechanism for direct talks between the United Arab Emirates (UAE)
and Iran in order to solve the dispute over three Gulf islands.
</P>
<P>
Both the UAE and Iran declared sovereignty over the three isles
of Abu Mussa and Greater and Lesser Tunbs, in the mouth of the
strategic Strait of Hormuz. The islands are now controlled by
Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The latest developments of the Middle East peace process will
also be discussed by the GCC top diplomats, Al-Hujailan was quoted
by Kuwait News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
The GCC, a regional political and economic alliance established
in 1981, comprises Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and
the UAE.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Unilateral Pullout Might Lead to Crisis: Shareh Warns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk
Shareh said here on Monday there is no specific time set for the
resumption of the Syrian-Israeli peace talks, warning Israeli
unilateral withdrawal from south Lebanon could trigger a crisis for
Lebanon and Syria.
</P>
<P>
"Israel's crisis in south Lebanon should turn into a crisis for
Lebanon and Syria after Israeli withdrawal," Shareh told reporters
after his meeting with visiting Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss.
</P>
<P>
"The question is very simple but Israel wants to complicate it.
Syria and Lebanon seek a fair and comprehensive solution and ask
for sincere implementation of the relevant U.N. Security Council
resolutions," he said, adding "Israel rejects this."
</P>
<P>
"Lebanon and Syria are ready to conclude peace deals with Israel
provided the latter withdraw fully from south Lebanon and the Golan
Heights to the international borders of June 4, 1967," according to
Shareh.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Hoss said his talks with Shareh dealt with the
peace process against the backdrop of the Geneva summit between
Syrian President Hafez al-Assad and U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"Our views were identical on all the issues raised during the
meeting," the Lebanese leader said.
</P>
<P>
Describing his talks with Syrian Prime Minister Mustafa Miro
as "very fruitful," Hoss said they discussed the peace process and
the Israel-planted hurdles before it, and the bilateral ties and
ways of developing them.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, assistant secretary general of the Lebanese Hezbollah
Sheikh Na'im Katem said his movement will continue its struggle and
will never offer Israel any guarantees until Israel withdraw from
Lebanon completely.
</P>
<P>
Hoss arrived here Monday morning on a one-day visit to Syria.

<HEADLINE> European Plane in Baghdad to Protest U.N. Embargo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 3 (Xinhua) -- A European airplane carrying three
persons from France and Italy, landed at the Al-Rashed military
airport in Baghdad at 19:45 local time (1645 GMT), to protest the
decade-long U.N. embargo on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, the first group came to Baghdad without getting
U.N. permission after the U.N. imposed embargo on Iraq since the
latter's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, was greeted by Abdul-Razak Al-
Hashimi, chairman of the Iraqi Friendship and Peace Organization.
</P>
<P>
It is widely expected that Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tareq
Aziz and Foreign Minister Mohammad Said Al-Sahaf will meet the
three Europeans, one from France and two from Italy.
</P>
<P>
At the airport, Jean-Marie Benjamin, head of the delegation,
read a declaration to the local and foreign media who have been
waiting for more than seven hours.
</P>
<P>
The declaration condemned the embargo that has claimed more than
1.5 million lives, and has destroyed the social, economic and
health-care structures of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The declaration termed the U.S and British non-stop unilateral
bombardments against Iraq as "a violation of international law," "
acts of terrorism" and "a genocide."
</P>
<P>
The declaration requested the U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
the member states of the U.N. Security Council to intervene as soon
as possible for "the immediate and total lifting of the embargo"
and to provide emergent and effective aid for Iraq's
reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question from Xinhua, Benjamin said that the
delegation will stay in Iraq for two or three days, but they have
no immediate schedule of their activities here.
</P>
<P>
Al-Hashimi said that Iraq appreciates the courage of the
delegation.
</P>
<P>
The plane, which flew directly from Amman, capital of Jordan, is
the second European airplane arriving in Iraq since 1990.
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, British Member of Parliament George Galloway
arrived here by plane to protest the U.N. sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Arafat: No Israeli Suggestion on Palestinian State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on
Monday denied that Israel offered a suggestion on the future
Palestinian state during the recent round of Washington talks.
</P>
<P>
Arafat told reporters in the West Bank city of Bethlehem after
his meeting with European Union Commissioner of Foreign Affairs
Christopher Patin.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Monday Palestinian chief negotiator in the interim
talks with Israel Saeb Erekat ruled out the existence of Israeli
offer to establish a Palestinian state on 50 percent of the
occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian chief negotiator in the final status talks Yasser
Abed Rabbo was quoted on Sunday as saying that Israel suggested to
group all the Jewish settlement blocks in Israel.
</P>
<P>
The essence of Israel's suggestion is to establish a Palestinian
state on some 50 percent of the West Bank consisting of two major
parts inside Israel's boundaries without any borders with other
Arab states, Rabbo said.
</P>
<P>
However, Erekat said the Israelis did not raise such an idea.
</P>
<P>
The Washington talks focusing on the issues of land, Palestinian
refugees and the future relations between Israel and Palestine have
yet made any progress.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to hold another round of talks on April 6
in a bid to reach a framework deal by May for a permanent peace
treaty by next September.

<HEADLINE> Arafat to Meet Clinton Late This Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat will hold talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton and
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright late this month, mainly
focusing on "final status" negotiations between Israel and the
Palestinians, the State Department said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
No dates have been set for Arafat's visit. He last met Clinton
in Davos, Switzerland, in January.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinian has set the date of September 13 as
the deadline for an a final status agreement, which would deal
many difficult issues, such as borders, Jerusalem, Palestinian
refugees and Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, lower-level Israeli-Palestinian talks will resume at
Bolling Air Force Base near Washington on Thursday after an eight-
day break, State Department spokesman James Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
"We expect them to be intensive, substantive, carrying forward
from what they discussed in the past. It's a little early to
speculate on exactly what will be happen but we do expect an
intense set of discussions," he told reporters.

<HEADLINE> Oil Production May Increase Again: Venezuelan Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan Oil Minister Ali
Rodriguez, the new president of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC), said Monday oil output may increase
among OPEC members this year.
</P>
<P>
He said last week's agreement in Vienna for an output hike of
about 1.7 million barrels a day would likely be insufficient. The
purpose of that hike was to bring down international oil prices
that had reached 10-year highs.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez reiterated the producer group's new price-band system
for guiding prices by regulating supplies, based on a range of 22
dollars to 28 dollars a barrel for the OPEC basket of crudes.
</P>
<P>
``If prices are below dollars 22, we'll cut production by 500,
000 barrels a day and when prices are above dollars 28 a barrel,
we'll increase production,'' Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, nine OPEC members agreed to boost output quotas by 1.
452 million barrels a day starting April 1, restoring the cuts
made a year ago in an effort to boost prices and stabilize the
market.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela, the largest oil exporter in the Western Hemisphere,
promised to cut 12,5000 bpd within the agreement.

<HEADLINE> Peru to Export Liquid Gas to Chile, Ecuador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Peru will supply liquid gas to the
Chilean and Ecuadoran markets, Minister of Energy and Mines Jorge
Chambot said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Liquids and condensations of Camisea gas deposit, discovered
in Peru's Amazon, will be exported from the first day of placing
in action of this project, programmed for the year 2003," said the
official.
</P>
<P>
With this purpose a trans-Andean gas pipeline will be built and
parallelly a housing estate will be constructed in Chincha, a
coastal city from which it'll be exported by sea, said Chambot.
</P>
<P>
According to Chambot, Peru is deficient in liquid petroleum gas
(LPG). However, it will be reversed once the Camisea deposit
enters into operation and it could even be exported to other
countries.
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion, there'll be a big international market for this
kind of project, mainly to Korea and Japan, as well as the United
States' west coast," he affirmed.
</P>
<P>
The international contest for transporting and distributing gas
will take place in May, whereby the closure of contracts for
concessions will be in June.

<HEADLINE> Annan Prefers Israel's Pullout from Southern Lebanon Part of Broader Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 3 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said on Monday that he preferred Israel's withdrawal
from southern Lebanon was part of a broader agreement between
Israel, Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Asked about Israel's intention to pull out with or without
prior agreement with Lebanon and Syria, Annan said in a press
conference at the headquarters in New York that he believed that
there was "some movement " on the Lebanon question.
</P>
<P>
"If the withdrawal comes outside a broader agreement,
obviously it's not an ideal situation", he said, adding the United
Nations would have to cope with that possibility.
</P>
<P>
Annan said he would meet Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy
in Geneva On Tuesday to discuss Israel's withdrawal from southern
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Noting that a U.N. force is stationed in southern Lebanon under
1978 Security Council resolution, Annan said "I think we will have
to discuss with the parties and see how we carry on our
responsibilities."
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon was established to
restore the Lebanese Government's authority over the southern part
of the country after a 1978 Israeli incursion against Palestinian
guerrillas.

<HEADLINE> Bush Outlines Environmental Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- George W. Bush, Texas governor
of the United States, Monday unveiled a six-point plan for
cleaning and redeveloping polluted industrial sites.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at the site of a former steel plant that was
cleaned up in southern Pittsburgh, the presumed Republican
presidential nominee said states have successfully begun cleaning
and reusing brownfields, so the federal government should
accelerate work on some 450,000 remaining sites.
</P>
<P>
Bush, in an attempt to answer Vice President Al Gore's
environmental credentials while showing he is a government
reformer, urged Americans to put priority on preserving the
environment.
</P>
<P>
"Prosperity will mean little if we leave to future generations
a world of polluted air, toxic lakes and rivers and banished
forests," said Bush.
</P>
<P>
The governor's proposal could help blunt criticism of
environmental problems in Texas, where air pollution in Houston
recently surpassed that of Los Angeles, observers said.
</P>
<P>
His proposals include directing the Environmental Protection
Agency to set high standards for brownfield cleanups, giving
developers who clean up brownfields under state redevelopment
plans protection from future federal legal action, focusing the
federal government on developing technologies and methods to clean
brownfields.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposals, Bush would also streamline bureaucracy and
block grants money under the 35 million dollar Brownfield Cleanup
Revolving Loan Fund, extend permanently a brownfield cleanup tax
credit that is scheduled to expire on December 31 and direct
active federal facilities to comply with all environmental
protection laws and hold them accountable when they do not.

<HEADLINE> DRC Accuses Uganda, Rwanda of Failure to Respect U.N. Resolution, Calls for U.N. Deployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC) Monday accused both Uganda and Rwanda, supporters of
the rebel movement to topple the DRC Government, of the failure to
honor their commitment to cease-fire and the U.N. Security Council
resolution 1291, calling for an early deployment of U.N. military
observers and peace-keepers in the Central African country.
</P>
<P>
Andre Mwamba Kapanga, DRC's permanent representative to the
United Nations, told a press conference here that his government
would "cooperate fully" with the United Nations in carrying out
the resolution.
</P>
<P>
"Regrettably, there has not been any improvement in the
process since the adoption of the new calendar and the Security
Council resolution 1291" in January when a mini-summit, which
attracted heads of state of the countries involved in the conflict
in DRC, was held at the U.N. Headquarters in New York, he said.
</P>
<P>
"In the northwestern part of our country, Uganda has been
consistently in attack our forces," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Both Uganda and Rwanda had no intention of respecting the new
calendar ... or the resolution 1291," he said. "And they are
intent on continuing to plunder the resources of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the DRC ambassador also criticized some members of
the Security Council for insisting on cease-fire first before the
start of the U.N. military deployment in the country, formerly
known as Zaire.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time through the U.N. that I heard members
of the U.N., the Security Council and the Secretariat said that
before we can go, bring peace in that area. We have to have a
cease-fire," he said.
</P>
<P>
"When the U.N. was involved in East Timor, for example,
shooting was taking place when the U.N. sent its solders there,"
he said. "The war was going on even in Kosovo, the U.N. was
involved to certain extent at a time when shooting was taking
place."
</P>
<P>
"In Bosnia, in Croatia, you had fighting going on and the U.N.
went there," he said. "In the case of the Congo, they said that
you have to have cease-fire ahead of time before the U.N. could go.
"
</P>
<P>
"There was a long period" during which "nobody was shooting" in
the central and southern parts of the DRC, "the U.N. never sent
soldiers there," he said. "My feeling is that people have to be
sincere, you either go to the Congo to bring peace, and help the
people and stop the misery, the suffering, the death ...in the
country, or you just let them die."
</P>
<P>
"I think that so far, the Security Council has chosen the
latter, that is not to intervene despite the fact many people are
dying," he said.
</P>
<P>
The many-sided DRC war has forced 1.3 million people from their
homes and created a humanitarian disaster, Ross Mountain, director
of the U.N.'s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs
in Geneva, said that 1.4 million Congolese out of a total
population of around 48 million were short of food and health care
as a result of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
The DRC ambassador said that his government has not known that
the U.N. has deployed any soldiers in his country despite a
technical team was in the country to make preparations.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations said that the current fighting in the
African country has stunted the deployment of 500 military
observers and 5,000 peace-keepers to monitor the shaky peace
process beginning with the signing of a peace accord in Lusaka,
Zambia, in July and August by the DRC Government and its allies
and the rebels trying to oust President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
The DRC conflict broke out in August 1998 shortly before Angola,
Namibia and Zimbabwe sent soldiers to fight with Kabila against
rebels, backed by Uganda and Rwanda.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Gets $3 Billion From 10-year Privatization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government has
 benefited a total of three billion U.S. dollars from the
privatization process since it started in 1990, it was disclosed
at a seminar held here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Director General of the Tanzania Investment Center (TIC) Samwel
Sitta told the cross-border investment and political risk
management seminar that about 110,000 jobs have been created in
the private sector.
</P>
<P>
"Tanzania stands a good chance to perform even better in the
private sector if it improves efficiency and encourage foreign and
local investors," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sitta, however, complained that the cost of doing business in
Tanzania is too high and that there are conflicting policies, laws
and regulations on investment as well as the administrative
cumbersome procedures.
</P>
<P>
He urged the government to equip the TIC with more powers so as
to enable it to become an effective facilitator for small, medium
and big investment in the country to improve lives of millions of
Tanzanians currently living in poverty.
</P>
<P>
Another senior Tanzanian official told the seminar that the
major macro economic and fiscal reforms carried out since 1995
have brought about a drastic reduction in inflation to seven
percent from as high as 35 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Minister of State in the President's Office Nassoro Malocho
said there has been an increased Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at
between five and six percent in the year 1998/99 and that the
interest rates have been stabilized at between 10 and 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Malocho said that Tanzania is primarily an agricultural economy
that generates about 50 percent of the total GDP and approximately
80 percent of the entire population depend directly on agriculture
and related sectors for their livelihood.
</P>
<P>
"The government has welcomed investors to participate in
large-scale farming," he said. "However, there has been a slow
response because the investment cost on agriculture infrastructure
is expensive and the investors want more assurance on land laws
before their investment."
</P>
<P>
The two-day seminar drew participants from the World Bank,
Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the seminar, Governor of the Uganda Central Bank
Charles Kikonyogo said the East African countries should make
plans while learning from the past mistakes so as to build
stronger economies and that removal of tariffs will encourage
cross border investment.
</P>
<P>
"Tanzania like many other countries in Sub-Saharan Africa has
in the past decade put in place reform measures that are turning
the country into a business friendly investment destination," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Non-Oil Export Enjoy 6.1 Percent Boost Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Iran's non-oil export enjoyed a 6.1
percent increase in the past Iranian calendar year which ended on
March 19 to reach 3.1 billion U.S. dollars, Iran's Customs unveiled
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a preliminary report, the Customs said that over 112 million
dollars of the export constituted cross border transactions and 121
million dollars was in the form of carry-on luggage exported to
various countries, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Export of rugs last Iranian year were valued at 686 million
dollars, constituting 22.7 percent of the total non-oil export on
the top of the list of export items, it said.
</P>
<P>
Other main non-oil export included chemicals valued at 333
million dollars, pistachios at 315 million dollars, ironware and
steel at 172 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Iran has made desperate efforts in the past decade to boost its
non-oil export with an aim to reducing its dependence on oil
revenues, which accounted for more than 80 percent of the country's
badly-needed hard currencies.
</P>
<P>
However, with the economic stagnation both in Iran and other
countries in recent years, Iran failed to reach the target of
fetching more than 5 billion dollars annually from non-oil export
set by its second five-year development plan (1995-2000).
</P>
<P>
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami announced an adjustment plan
in 1998 to boost domestic production in order to save the
country's "ailing economy." However, the country failed to make a
desirable development in non-oil sectors due to white-hot factional
struggles, bureaucratic procedures and lack of foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
According to the Iranian Customs, the country's import last
Iranian year amounted to 13.2 billion dollars, showing a decrease
of 8.4 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Machinery, industrial and electric appliances, ironware, wheat,
chemicals and cooking oil were the main imported goods.

<HEADLINE> EU Calls for Fresh Start of Ties with Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 3 (Xinhua) -- At the opening of the first Africa-
Europe summit here Monday, the European Union (EU) called for a
fresh start of the relations with Africa which it described as
the "main victim" of unfair global relationships.
</P>
<P>
"It is our profound wish that this most meaningful occasion
should represent a moment of renewal in the relations between our
two neighboring continents," European Union Council President
Antonio Guterres said in a speech at the summit attended by over 60
leaders of African and EU states.
</P>
<P>
Guterres, who is prime minister of Portugal, which holds the
rotating EU presidency, told the leaders that the summit's "
profoundly symbolic nature" should be "rich in consequences" for
Africans and Europeans.
</P>
<P>
"The African continent has been the main victim of the unfair
character of the present architecture of international relations.
This is both unacceptable and unsustainable," he said in the
conference center in the Egyptian capital.
</P>
<P>
"Africa must not be marginalized in the economic and
technological revolution that we are all undergoing," Guterres
said.
</P>
<P>
"That is why we share the concern of African leaders for the
burden of external debt, for open market access to their products,
for investment and technological flows, for international aid to
development," he added.
</P>
<P>
The summit is to discuss economic, political together with
social problems in Africa and seek ways of boosting cooperation
between Africa and the EU in resolving the issues.
</P>
<P>
To show the continuation of the efforts, African and EU foreign
ministers agreed on Sunday that a ministerial group will be set up
to follow up what will be decided by the leaders and that a second
summit will be held in 2003.

<HEADLINE> European Commission President Envisages Better EU- Libya Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Romano Prodi, president of the
Commission of the European Union (EU), expressed confidence here on
Monday that the relations between the EU and Libya "will be
better."
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the opening ceremony of the first
Africa-Europe summit, Prodi said that his meeting with Libyan
leader Muammar Gaddafi earlier in the day would help develop good
relations between Europe and the North African country.
</P>
<P>
Prodi and Gaddafi were in Cairo to take part in the two-day
summit also attended by leaders of other African and EU countries
to discuss economic, political and social issues in Africa and seek
EU's efforts to help promote African development.
</P>
<P>
Prodi said that in the meeting, Gaddafi also showed willingness
for improving relations with Europe.
</P>
<P>
Ties between European countries and Libya had been marred by the
Europeans' accusation that tripoli was supporting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
However, their relations began easing up after Libya handed over
last year the two Libyans suspected of bombing a Pan-Am flight in
1988 over Lockerbie, Scotland, which killed 270 people.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council imposed diplomatic, air and
arms sanctions on Libya in 1992 for its refusal to surrender the
suspects. The sanctions have been suspended after the handover.
</P>
<P>
Regarding Gaddafi's attitude towards the cooperation between
North African countries and the EU within the framework of the so-
called Barcelona process, Prodi said that the Libyan leader was not
directly interested in the process, "but he is not against it."
</P>
<P>
The 15 EU member states and 12 Mediterranean rim countries
signed in 1995 in Spain the Barcelona Declaration, which was aimed
at creating an area for free trade and with common political and
security policies by 2010.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on his meeting with Gaddafi, Prodi said it is
important that "we have opened a dialog." "It is not the last page
in our book," he added, hinting at more meetings between Europe and
Libya.

<HEADLINE> First Africa-Europe Summit Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 3 (Xinhua) -- African leaders at the opening
session of the first Africa-Europe summit Monday called on Africa
and the European Union (EU) to forge better cooperation for mutual
benefits and universal progress.
</P>
<P>
"We do look forward not to securing more aid, but rather to
developing our mutual partnership and cooperation program," said
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, who inaugurated the two-day
summit in the International Conference Center in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Africa seeks to support its sustained efforts on all levels to
achieve a comprehensive revival for the continent, in a way that
allows Africa to occupy the position it deserves, Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
Africans hope to establish "a new form of close partnership"
with EU countries, "based on common interests and mutual benefits,
to realize prosperity and welfare" for both sides, he added.
</P>
<P>
Seven of the 15 EU members states are former colonial powers in
Africa and the EU gives 15 billion U.S. dollars to Africa every
five years, more than any other single source.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing summit is co-sponsored by the EU and the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) with an aim to forge new and
strategic partnership between the two continents in the 21st
century and in the economic globalization.
</P>
<P>
Heads of state or government, or their representatives from 66
African and European states are attending the summit.
</P>
<P>
Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, whose country is
holding the presidency of the OAU also said at the opening session
that "let this historic site be a witness to a new departure, a
veritable renewal of these links, for the furtherance of mutual
understanding and universal progress."
</P>
<P>
He noted that Africa has been aware of backwardness and risk of
being pushed even further outside of the general movement of
progress with the advent of economic globalization.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. figures, half of the continent's 700 million
population are living in poverty. For years, most African countries
have remained as major suppliers of raw materials to the world
market due to the lack of industrial basis.
</P>
<P>
The heave external debts that have reached staggering 350
billion dollars, widespread wars and conflicts and diseases have
further worsened the economic situation on the continent.
</P>
<P>
The poor investment environment has in turn scared away foreign
investors. Scarcely 1 percent of direct foreign investment has been
channelled to Africa during the last two years.
</P>
<P>
Bouteflika said Africa is concerned about "being locked for good
in the tragic reality."
</P>
<P>
Bouteflika highlighted the debt issue in his speech, urging EU,
the major creditor of Africa, to handle the debt issue not
according to the African states' capability of reimbursement, but
with an eye on mutual benefit and joint development in the long
run.
</P>
<P>
African states are spending 23 billion dollars, or 30.9 percent
of their exports, every year to service the enormous sum of
external debts. Little money was left for the African countries for
further public investment, technical upgrade and economic
expansion.
</P>
<P>
Most African countries have cried for EU steps for easing the
debt burden and regarded the summit as an opportunity to address
the issue.
</P>
<P>
On ways of solving African problems and promoting the
continent's development, Bouteflika urged the EU to take into
consideration the actual conditions of Africa.
</P>
<P>
The EU has initially seen the summit as a political event,
highlighting democracy, conflict prevention, human rights,
different from Africa's pressing economic concerns.
</P>
<P>
The two sides smoothed out their differences at the eleventh
hour ahead of the summit to discuss economic as well as political
issues.
</P>
<P>
Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Guterres, whose country
initiated the summit and is holding the EU presidency, also
addressed the opening session.
</P>
<P>
He said "it is our profound wish that this most meaningful
occasion should represent a moment of renewal in the relationship
between our two neighboring continents."
</P>
<P>
He stressed the new development in the world, such as the rapid
development of technology, the advent of information society and
economic globalization, "must not create a divide between us and
our neighbors... they must create new opportunities to share
political, economic and cultural development based on fundamental
shared values."
</P>
<P>
He also noted the equal footing on African economic, social and
political issues, saying EU will cooperate with African states in
solving their problems.

<HEADLINE> Greece to Deregulate Energy, Telecoms by 2001 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Greece will deregulate its energy
and telecommunications markets by 2001 in a bid to speed up the
pace of the country's privatization.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in an interview with the state televison NET network
Monday, Greek Economy and Finance Minister Yiannos Papantoniou
said that the state-run Public Power Corporation (PPC) would be
floated in the stock market in November this year and the
corporation would from 2001 lose its monopoly in electricity
supply.
</P>
<P>
With the aim of benefiting Greeks through lower electricity
rates and seeking better services arising from stronger
competition in the energy market, other companies would also be
allowed to produce electricity power from then on, he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the Greek government would also seek a
strategic partner for the state-operated the Hellenic
Telecommunications Organization (OTE) this Autumn, and from next
year, other private companies would be able to offer alternative
telephone services in the country.
</P>
<P>
Papantoniou said that this would offer OTE access to
international markets and to new technology.

<HEADLINE> British Catalogue Exhibition Opens in Nairobi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 3 (Xinhua) -- A British catalogue exhibition
involving more than 70 companies was opened here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition "Britain in East Africa", unlike the traditional
one with a display of products and equipment, just showcases the
catalogues detailing the products and services of the British
companies, which saves on costs that could have been directed to
shipment and exhibition.
</P>
<P>
The participants are from financial, manufacturing,
agricultural, horticultural, electronic, education, health and
Information technology sectors, said the Promoter Exhibitions,
the organizer of the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
Dave Howells, the operation manager of the Promoter
Exhibitions, said through the catalogues, potential trading
partners and customers could select the firms which have their
products requirements to deal with.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, east African firms will also be able to select
British companies to whom they could market their products,
Howells added.
</P>
<P>
After the two-day display in Kenya, the exhibition will move to
Uganda's capital Kampala and run on April 13 and 14, and finally
will take place in the Tanzanian capital Dar es Salaam on April
27 and 28.

<HEADLINE> Norway Urges Zimbabwe to End Farm Invasions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Norway on Monday urged Zimbabwe to
put an end to the illegal invasions of white-owned farms by war
veterans and ensure that the land reform process is followed
properly, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian Embassy in Zimbabwe said in a statement that the
Zimbabwean government should uphold a High Court ruling passed on
March 23 by Judge Paddington Garwe ordering ex-combatants to
vacate farms they had invaded within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
"We urge the government of Zimbabwe to put an end to the
illegal farm invasions as declared by the High Court of Zimbabwe,"
the embassy said.
</P>
<P>
"The government of Norway supports the implementation of land
reform in Zimbabwe. Such a process is important to resolve the
issue of an equitable land distribution in the country and should
aim at poverty alleviation through the resettlement of thousands
of poor people from overcrowded communal lands," it said.
</P>
<P>
The embassy urged the Zimbabwean government to follow the land
reform process as a basis for future cooperation with donors.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe recently denied allegations
that the government had ordered the countrywide invasions of
white-owned farms by former freedom fighters and land hungry
villagers.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said he would not intervene as long as the invasions,
which he regarded as mere demonstrations, remained peaceful.

<HEADLINE> Another Cyclone Heading Towards Mozambique Channel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Coastal areas of the northern
Mozambican provinces of Nampula and Cabo Delgado may be hit by
cyclone Hudah within the next 24 hours, a source of the Mozambican
National Meteorology Institute (INAM) said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Acacio Tembe, who is working in the INAM, said that the
cyclone, which formed near the French possession of Reunion, in
the Indian Ocean, a week ago, is presently at the northeast of
Madagascar, and is heading towards the northern part of the
Mozambique Channel.
</P>
<P>
Tembe explained that the cyclone is travelling at about 26
kilometers an hour, bringing with it heavy rains and winds of up
to 80 kilometers an hour.
</P>
<P>
The effects of Hudah may be comparable to those of the cyclone
Eline, that hit the country on February 22, Tembe said.
</P>
<P>
Eline did severe damage to Beira, and to parts of Sofala and
Inhambane provinces that had already been flooded earlier in
February.
</P>
<P>
If Hudah does hit northern Mozambique, the torrential rain it
brings may cause rivers that have so far posed no serious threat,
such as the Rovuma and the Lurio, to burst their banks.
</P>
<P>
INAM fears that Hudah, if it turns southwards, could also hit
Zambezia, Sofala and Tete provinces, within the next 48 hours.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Calls for Closer Afro-EU Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 3 (Xinhua) -- At the historic Africa-Europe summit
which opened Monday, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak called on
Africa and the European Union (EU) to forge better cooperation for
mutual benefits.
</P>
<P>
"We do look forward not to securing more aid, but rather to
developing our mutual partnership and cooperation program," Mubarak
said in an inaugural speech.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of 53 African countries and the 15 EU nations are
participating in the summit, which is to discuss economic,
political and social issues in Africa and explore ways to enhance
African-EU cooperation in these aspects.
</P>
<P>
Africa seeks to support its sustained efforts on all levels to
achieve a comprehensive revival for the continent, in a way that
allows Africa to occupy the position it deserves, Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
Africans hope to establish "a new form of close partnership"
with EU countries, "based on common interests and mutual benefits,
to realize prosperity and welfare" for both sides, he added.
</P>
<P>
"It is worth mentioning that African countries have made
significant strides over the past decade to create a favorable
atmosphere to pave the way for overcoming the problems it has
suffered for years," he said.
</P>
<P>
Those strides included "economic restructuring reform" and
establishing "pillars of democracy, freedom, and respect for human
rights and the rule of law," the Egyptian leader added.
</P>
<P>
Drawing attention to the Africans' dominant concern at the
summit, Mubarak said "unfavorable external conditions" were to
blame for their continent's staggering 350 billion U.S. dollars in
foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
Those conditions included a "tangible drop" in foreign funds
going into Africa over the past two decades, declining prices for
raw materials, and Africa's small share of world trade, he said.
</P>
<P>
Africa's export accounted for 6 percent of the world's total
years ago, but the share has declined to 2 percent now.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the Cairo summit will "give a strong
impetus" to efforts by Algeria and South Africa on behalf of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) to convince lending countries "
to ease debt burdens and service costs."

<HEADLINE> Iran Produces 6.3 Million Tons of Steel Last Fiscal year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Iran produced over 6.3 million tons
of unprocessed steel in the past Iranian fiscal year which ended on
March 19, an official from the National Iranian Steel Company
(NISC) announced on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Managing Director of the NISC for Plan and Budget Affairs
Musa Aqa Lankarani said the steel output was three percent higher
than the company's projection, marking a 12 percent increase from
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Lankarani said more than 5.299 million tons of steel products
were produced at Iranian steel complexes during the year, showing a
rise of 18 percent from the previous year, the Islamic Republic
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
During the period, more than 996,990 tons of steel products
worth 156 million U.S. dollars were exported, he said, adding 660,
000 tons out of the export consignment were steel slabs produced in
southwestern province of Khuzestan.
</P>
<P>
Iran has made desperate efforts in boosting its steel industry
since former Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani came to power in
1989, making the country the largest steel producer in the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
Iran's current steel production capacity was reported at seven
million tons annually and officials said that the country hopes to
raise its steel production capacity to 14.7 million tons by the end
of its third five-year development plan (2000-2005).
</P>
<P>
Lankarani also put the total amount of iron-ore output in the
year at more than 6.9 million tons, or 86 percent of the 8.1
million-ton target.
</P>
<P>
About 165,278 tons of processed minerals were produced in the
country last Iranian year, meeting 97 percent of the target, he
added.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Pursue Confidence Building Policy in New Year: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi has stated that in the new Iranian year starting on March
20 Iran will follow the policy of building confidence with other
countries, the Gulf states in particular.
</P>
<P>
"Iran's detente policy completed its due course in the last
Iranian year and is now in the process of confidence building with
other countries," Kharrazi told envoys and representatives of
foreign countries and international organizations on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said Tehran is determined to expand and consolidate ties with
all countries on the basis of mutual respect, the Islamic Republic
News Agency reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Iran, which started the detente policy after the moderate
President Mohammad Khatami came to power in August 1997, succeeded
in breaking the political isolation of the United States by
improving relations with its neighbors and the European countries.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi also briefed the audience of Iran's diplomatic
activities at the international level, inside the Organization of
the Islamic Conference under its chairmanship and Tehran's efforts
to strengthen the organization.
</P>
<P>
He said the most important achievements in the domestic scene
last Iranian year were the municipal elections and the February 18
sixth Majlis (parliament) elections, in which Iranian reformists
won overwhelming victories over the powerful conservatives.
</P>
<P>
The elections indicated establishment and institutionalization
of democracy in Iran and serve as an important backbone for the
system and the country, he added.

<HEADLINE> Erekat Denies Israeli Suggestion on Area of Palestinian State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian chief negotiator in the
interim talks Saeb Erekat has denied a reported Israeli suggestion
on establishing the Palestinian state on 50 percent of the West
Bank, said the Palestinian News Agency on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Erekat's remarks referred to the reports that cited Palestinian
chief negotiator in the final-status talks Yasser Abed Rabbo as
saying on Sunday that Israel proposed to the Palestinians last week
to hand over two settlements in the West Bank as part of the future
Palestinian Independent state in lieu of annexing the rest of the
West Bank to Israel.
</P>
<P>
Rabbo who headed the Palestinian side in the peace talks with
Israel in Washington last week has reportedly said the essence of
the Israeli suggestion is to establish a Palestinian state on 50
percent of the West Bank, which has no borders with any Arab
countries and to be surrounded by Israeli from all directions.
</P>
<P>
However, Erekat said the Israeli side did not suggest such a
state.
</P>
<P>
The Washington talks focusing on the land issue, the Palestinian
refugees and the future relations between Israel and Palestine have
not achieved any progress.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side insists on the implementation of the
relevant U.N. Security Council resolution on top of which are the
Resolution No. 242 and the Resolution No. 338, Erekat noted.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians also stick to the reference of the Madrid Peace
Conference enshrining land-for-peace principle and to the Israeli
withdrawal from all territories occupied in 1967 including
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to hold a new round of talks on April 6 to
reach a framework agreement by May as a prelude to signing a
permanent peace accord by September.

<HEADLINE> Libyan Leader Meets EU Commission President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi
insisted on the priority Libya attaches to close relations with
Europe both on a bilateral scale and in the framework of a regional
cooperation with other Northern African Mediterranean countries.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi voiced the stance in meeting with European Union
Commission President Romano Prodi Monday just ahead of the Africa-
Europe summit that opened Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Gaddafi-Prodi talks, taking place by Gaddafi's spacious tent
erected in the presidential palace, is the Libyan leader's first
such meeting since U.N. sanctions on Libya were suspended last year
after the Northern Africa state surrended the two suspects in a
1988 bombing of an American flight.
</P>
<P>
Libya's statements on Israel and the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) have dented its chances of joining the "Barcelona
process," which kicked off in 1995 the political, economic, social
and security cooperation between the 15-member EU and 12
Mediterranean rim countries. 
</P>
<P>
Libya has said it accepts the EU's conditions for joining the
process. But it said the participation of Israel and the PNA would
have a negative influence, and they should be excluded until there
was a "just peace" in the region. 
</P>
<P>
EU officials have said this position is unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
The European Union has asked for a clear acceptance, without
conditions and in written form, of the Barcelona "acquis" from
Libya. The acquis, or rules, include commitments to human
rights, democracy, regional stability and free trade.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi also made clear that he accepts that the Barcelona
acquis as reiterated by President Prodi is not negotiable by the
EU.
</P>
<P>
He also acknowledged the contributions made by the EU
Commission, the executive arm of the EU, to the development of
Africa and the active role of the EU in facing dramatic problems
like debts, poverty and struggle against endemic diseases.
</P>
<P>
The leaders came to Cairo for the first two-day Africa-Europe
summit, which involved heads of state or government, or their
representatives from most of the 53 African states and all the 15
EU members.

LONDON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Fifty percent of Britons believe
Britain will have joined the European single currency by 2010
whether they like it or not, according to an opinion poll
published on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Gallop poll for the Daily Telegraph newspaper showed that
46 percent believed Britain would not join the euro by then.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-four percent believed euro membership would be a bad
development for Britain and only 32 percent thought it would be
good.
</P>
<P>
The poll showed 49 percent of Britons believed control over
foreign policy would be removed from London to the European Union'
s headquarters in Brussels during the coming decade, while 42
percent said it wouldn't.
</P>
<P>
A majority believed Britain's environmental policy and
employment legislation would also be run from Brussels by 2010.
</P>
<P>
Forty-one percent said Britain's standard of living would fall
if the country left the European Union, while 16 percent said it
would rise. Thirty-nine percent said it would remain the same.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Tony Blair favors joining the euro after the
next general election, provided economic conditions are right and
a referendum approves the move. The next general election must be
held by May 2002.

PARIS, April 3 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
said on Monday that France will designate soon an ambassador for
environment and will propose the creation of a global organization
for regulating economic development to reinforce environment
protection.
</P>
<P>
In a speech on environment protection and territorial
management at the Sorbonne University, Jospin said that the time
has come for the world to have global regulations for development.
</P>
<P>
``We should engage ourselves in this without delay... France is
ready to bring this question in the international debate to be
held in 2002,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Jospin said that the regulations for development and
environment protection should be based on ``negotiated and fair
compromises'' to be reached by different countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that European countries should first of all start the
process by establishing an informal mechanism of dialogue among
associations, enterprises, scientists and public decision-makers.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the government should seek support from the
general public as well as enterprises in this field.

<HEADLINE> Annan Says His Millennium Report Resolutely Forward-looking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 3 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said on Monday that his Millennium Report was
resolutely forward-looking and a comprehensive account of the main
challenges facing humanity in the twenty-first century.
</P>
<P>
The Millennium Report titled "We the Peoples: The role of the
United Nations in the 21st century" was launched here today in
which the Secretary-General sets out a practical vision for the
United Nations in a globalized world.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press, Annan said the report contains some
pretty alarming facts, particularly on the environment, and also
some pretty shaming ones, particularly on poverty.
</P>
<P>
It shows that the world has been far too tolerant of gross
injustice and human misery, and it argues that must be changed,
the U.N. chief said.
</P>
<P>
"The world's political leaders have agreed to meet here in New
York in September, in the largest gathering at such a high level
there has ever been," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"Their peoples would be gravely disappointed if they simply
came here, made a few speeches, and went away again. They need to
agree on the most urgent tasks we face together, and to adopt a
strategy for carrying them out," he said.
</P>
<P>
"While governments do have to work together to make these
changes possible, governments alone are not going to make them
happen. Much of the heavy lifting will be done by private
investment, partnerships with philanthropic foundations will also
be very important," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"The overall message is that these are problems we share, and
that we have a common interest in solving them. And they are
problems we can deal with, if only we summon the will," Annan
added.

<HEADLINE> Britain Adopts Tough Measures on Asylum Seekers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Tough new measures came into force
in Britain on Monday aimed at deterring asylum seekers, replacing
cash payments to refugees with vouchers and fining lorry drivers
for carrying stowaways.
</P>
<P>
The Labor government says the Immigration and Asylum Act should
speed up a labyrinthine process and make life fairer for those
truly in need. But refugee rights groups reacted angrily to the
crackdown.
</P>
<P>
"What we are offering is putting in place a system which
supports and helps those genuinely seeking asylum but which is
there also to deter people who make completely unfounded claims
and bring the whole system of asylum into disrepute," the Reuters
quoted Immigration Minister Barbara Roche as saying.
</P>
<P>
The measures came into force as Britain is gripped by a
controversy over the treatment of refugees. Rising numbers of
European beggars on London's streets and in the Tube, the capital'
s underground railway, have led to a campaign by some popular
newspapers saying the country is swamped by illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
At present, about 80 percent of asylum seekers are concentrated
in London and the southeast. The government says the financial
burden must now be shared out more widely.
</P>
<P>
It plans to disperse asylum seekers across the country, despite
fears that this will cut off refugees from their key support
networks.
</P>
<P>
The government says it wants to help genuine refugees and is
getting to grips with the backlog of asylum cases, currently
standing at more than 100,000.

<HEADLINE> Annan Urges Member States' Commitment to Ending Poverty, Inequality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 3 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan on Monday called on the Member States to commit themselves
to ending poverty and inequality.
</P>
<P>
In his Millennium Report" We the Peoples, The role of the
United Nations in the 21st century" launched here today, Annan
said the benefits of globalization include faster economic growth,
higher living standards and diffusion of technology and management
skills for individuals and countries alike.
</P>
<P>
"But these benefits remain highly concentrated among a
relatively small number of countries and are spread unevenly
within them," the U.N, chief noted.
</P>
<P>
"While there are now strong and well enforced rules
facilitating the expansion of global markets, efforts to secure
equally valid social objectives such as labor standards, the
environment, human rights or poverty reduction, have lagged behind,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
"The challenge is clear, if we are to capture the promises of
globalization while managing its adverse effects, we must learn to
govern better, and we must learn how better to govern together,"
he sad.
</P>
<P>
Annan urged the world to halve by 2015 the proportion of the
world's people whose income is less than one dollars a day.
</P>
<P>
"The world's people are telling us that our past achievements
are not enough, given the scale of the challenges we face, we must
do more, and we must do it better," Annan added.
</P>
<P>
The report is prepared for the Millennium Summit of the United
Nations to be held from September 6 to 8 in New York which is
expected to be the largest-ever gathering of heads of State and
Government.

<HEADLINE> "Visas For Life" Exhibit Opens at U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 3 (Xinhua) -- A series of events are
scheduled to take place from morning to night on Monday at the U.N.
Headquarters in New York, with the opening of the exhibit "Visas
For Life: The Righteous Diplomats."
</P>
<P>
The exhibit was designated to honor more than 80 diplomats,
including who risked their lives and livelihood to rescue Jews and
other refugees during the Holocaust (1938-1945), Eric Saul, one of
the exhibit organizers, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Fengshan Ho, the Chinese Consul General in Vienna during
World War II, is among the diplomats honored at the exhibition for
his decision to issue life-saving visas to the Jews in the German-
occupied Austria.
</P>
<P>
Ho was one of the first diplomats to save Jews by issuing them
visas to Shanghai, East China, to escape the Nazis, who exercised
fiercely hostile policy toward Jews during the World War II.
</P>
<P>
The exhibit and programs are cosponsored by the Office of the
United Nations High Commission and other institutions such as the
American Jewish Committee, the World Jewish Congress and the
Jewish National Fund.
</P>
<P>
Manli Ho, daughter of Dr. Ho, told Xinhua that his father "
remain completely unknown, even by the people he had saved," for
many years.
</P>
<P>
Harry Fiedler, son of the parents who got the Chinese life-
saving visa before his birth in Shanghai, told Xinhua, "Without Dr.
Ho, I wouldn't be here today."
</P>
<P>
Born in September 1901 in Yiyang, Hunan Province in Central
China, Ho died in September 1997 in San Francisco at 96.
</P>
<P>
Of the four still living, two -- Jan Karski, former Consul
General of Poland, and Selahattin Ulkumen, former Turkish Consul
General to Rhodes -- attended the opening of the exhibit.
</P>
<P>
There will be a special viewing of the exhibit for invited
guests and families of both the diplomats and those they rescued,
followed by a convocation in the General Assembly Hall on Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
Nane Annan, wife of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, will
speak at the convocation, and Wang Yingfan, the Chinese permanent
representative to the United Nations, will attend the convocation,
diplomatic sources here said.
</P>
<P>
A number of diplomats honored in the exhibit lost their lives
during this heroic rescue. Collectively, they saved more than 250,
000 lives. Today, there are more than 500,000 living descendants
of these survivors and refugees.

<HEADLINE> UNDP Report Says Countries Falling Back on Commitment to End Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Countries are not doing
enough to reduce poverty in their societies, according to a new
United Nations Development Program (UNDP) report to be released
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report, "Overcoming Human Poverty: UNDP Poverty Report
2000," states that while more than 75 percent of poor nations have
measured the extent and dimensions of poverty in their societies,
less than a third have set targets for reducing it.
</P>
<P>
The report calls on the developed and developing countries to
renew their efforts to eradicate poverty by strengthening
governance and by empowering people to improve their livelihood
and opportunities.
</P>
<P>
"Old-school prescriptions of supplementing rapid growth with
social spending and safety nets have proved inadequate," the
report's authors said.
</P>
<P>
In the foreword to the report, UNDP Administrator Mark Brown
said, "We should aim to help build up the capacities of
governments, at both national and local levels, to assume control
and direct their own initiatives. This is the vitally important
capacity-building agenda for external assistance."
</P>
<P>
Most of the developed countries have long failed to honor
their commitment to earmark 0.7 percent of their Gross National
Product for Official Development Assistance.

<HEADLINE> Russia Refutes Robinson's Complaints on Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 3 (Xinhua) -- A ranking Russian official on
Monday dismissed complaints by U.N. High Commissioner for Human
Rights Mary Robinson about her trip to the war-torn Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Kalamanov, the Russian presidential human rights envoy
to the breakaway republic, said Robinson was incorrect when she
asserted that she had not been allowed to visit the places in
Chechnya that she wanted to see.
</P>
<P>
Russia was unable to organize a visit to Katyr-Yurt because it
had not been put on the itinerary for her trip to the breakaway
republic,the Interfax news agency quoted Kalamanov as saying.
</P>
<P>
Kalamanov described Robinson's claim as a "common lie."
</P>
<P>
He also rejected rumors that tens of thousands of people were
held in detention facilities in Chechnya, stressing that there
were only 848 names on a list of people detained by the Interior
Ministry troops.
</P>
<P>
Kalamanov said the human rights office in Chechnya has received
around 2,500 complaints about various human rights violations in
the past month.
</P>
<P>
"The passport problem must be resolved for the refugees. The
people cannot move about without (identity) documents. Chechnya
has already received 100,000 new passports, and I expect the
situation to be resolved soon," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kalamanov complained of Robinson's biased stance.
</P>
<P>
"As I said, it would be very difficult to restore the Chechens'
trust, but why is such mistrust is displayed by the high
commissioner?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
"When we talk with Mrs. Robinson one-on-one, no problems arise.
As soon as Mrs. Robinson's suite appears, she immediately changes,
"Kalamanov said, adding that he was confused by Robinson's
behavior.
</P>
<P>
Hypocrisy as regards the issue of Chechnya must be removed in
relations between Russia and the West, Kalamanov said.
</P>
<P>
"We will not allow anyone to put the bandits and terrorists on
the same level with the Russian military and government," he said.
</P>
<P>
Robinson is expected to present her report on Chechnya at a U.N.
Commission for Human Rights conference on April 5.
</P>
<P>
She met earlier Monday with Russian Emergency Situations
Minister Sergei Shoigu in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Robinson also held a meeting with Colonel General Valery
Manilov,first deputy Chief of Staff of the Russian Armed Forces.
</P>
<P>
"In the course of a detailed conversation, an understanding was
achieved on the need to study thoroughly and comprehensively all
reports on human rights violation that alleged to happen in the
North Caucasus," Manilov told reporters after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
According to Manilov, Robinson agreed that "The truth must be
established in every particular case, and it is only on this basis
that reports to the public, political statements and conclusions
should be made."

<HEADLINE> S. African Government Supports Labor Movement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 3 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy
President Jacob Zuma Monday reaffirmed his government's support
for a strong labor movement.
</P>
<P>
Zuma was speaking at the 17th World Congress of the
International Confederation of Trade Unions in Durban amid growing
tension between the government and the Congress of South African
Trade Unions (COSATU) over the federation's anti-unemployment
campaign.
</P>
<P>
The congress, which is being attended by about 1000 labor
delegates from across the world, is jointly hosted by COSATU,
National Congress of Trade Unions and Federated Unions of South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
"We are firmly in favour of a strong, well-organized, visionary
and independent trade union movement as this can only be to the
advantage of the transformation project in our country," Zuma
said.
</P>
<P>
His comments came as COSATU continued its countrywide campaign
against, among others, job losses, which will culminate in a
national strike by COSATU's 1.8 million members on May 10.
</P>
<P>
COSATU has claimed that since 1994 there have been 500,000 job
losses. It started its campaign on January 31, with various unions
affiliated to the federation organizing workplace protests and
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
Zuma told the conference that growing unemployment remained one
of the biggest challenges facing trade unions, not only in South
Africa, but also across the world.
</P>
<P>
He said there were still insufficient flows of foreign
investment into African countries, which was vital to their
economic prospects such as job creation.
</P>
<P>
He called on trade unions to focus on issues such as debt
relief and protectionist practices by developed countries who
continually failed to open up markets to developing nations on
favorable conditions.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that trade unions in developed countries invest a
percentage of their retirement and annuity funds towards job
retention and creation in developing countries.

<HEADLINE> SADC Biodiversity Forum Opens In Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Southern African Development
Community (SADC) Biodiversity Forum opened here on Monday with
delegates calling for the intensification of efforts to seek
regional consensus on important biological issues.
</P>
<P>
The three-day forum comes ahead of a conference of parties to
the United Nation's Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) to be
held in Nairobi next month.
</P>
<P>
The participants said while SADC countries are signatories to
the convention in their individual capacities, there is need to
speak with one voice.
</P>
<P>
They felt that the accession of SADC into the CBD would enable
the region to have access to more resources for projects and
activities aimed at coordinating a regional approach to
conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity.
</P>
<P>
The participants agreed that discussion to find a way around
the accession issue should continue at the forum while solutions
would be forwarded to the council of ministers.
</P>
<P>
The forum also seeks to review the progress made by members
states in developing country strategies, preparing and
implementing national action plans relating to biodiversity
conservation.
</P>
<P>
Other objectives include sharing experiences on appropriate
mechanisms for effective and sustainable ways of information
exchange on biodiversity conservation among SADC member states.

<P>
BRUSSELS, April 3 (Xinhua) -- A planned transport of highly
radioactive nuclear waste was stopped by a Judge in Belgium, local
media said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The judge in the Belgian town of Dendermonde stopped the
transport Sunday night on the territory of the town in the
Province of East Flanders.
</P>
<P>
The judge made the decision after he agreed with a claim of
Greenpeace, the environmental organization, that relevant safety
measures were inadequate.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian government had agreed to a first shipment of
nuclear waste from a reprocessing plant in France to Mol in the
Belgian Province of Antwerp.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian Ministry of Interior said it will appeal the ruling.
</P>
<P>
Last week, three cities in this country said they would ban the
transport of the highly toxic waste on their territories. The
three cities are Mol, Geel and Dessel.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Senior Official Invited to Visit Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 3 (Xinhua) -- A senior Israeli official has
been invited to visit Libya, a signal that the two countries may
begin to improve their bilateral relations, Israel Radio reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ra'anan Cohen, Secretary-General of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak's Labor party, received the official invitation to begin the
ice-breaking tour in the near future, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The invitation was extended by head of a Libyan delegation to
the inter-parliamentary convention on security and cooperation of
Mediterranean countries, which is currently meeting in Marseilles,
France.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Israel's Ha'aretz daily reported that the
European Union (EU) is behind the scene to press Libyan leader
Muammar Gaddafi to recognize Israel.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi is to meet some European leaders on the sidelines of the
first Africa-Europe summit, held in Cairo, Egypt on Monday and
Tuesday and attended by leaders from most of 53 African countries
and the 15-member EU in an effort to create joint partnership
between the two continents.
</P>
<P>
It is still unknown whether Ra'anan Cohen's tour of Libya has
connection with the EU's pressure or not.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the EU and the U.S. is trying hard to end
Israel's isolation among its Arab neighbors. Last week, a group of
Israeli passport holders received a warm welcome in their visit to
Yemen.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Libya is also seeking more amicable relations with
Western countries since last April, when it handed over two
suspects in the Lockerbie bombing of Pan Am flight 103 in 1988,
which killed 270 people.
</P>
<P>
The United States, which has designated Libya as a state sponsor
of terrorism since 1979 and imposed comprehensive unilateral
sanctions causing US oil companies and investors to pull out in
1986, is reportedly considering lifting the embargo.
</P>
<P>
Washington believes Libya has also changed its opposition
attitude toward the Israeli-Palestinian peace track.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Construction Spending Rises in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Spending on construction
projects around the country rose 1.5 percent in February to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 758.7 billion U.S. dollars, an
all-time high monthly level, the Commerce Department said Monday.
</P>
<P>
It marked the fifth straight month in which construction
spending rose. In January, construction spending grew by 2.2
percent, slightly less than the 2.7 percent increase the
government previously estimated.
</P>
<P>
Robust construction and housing activity helped fuel the U.S.
economy's strong growth last year. Monday's report suggested that
construction activity remains at healthy levels despite the
Federal Reserve has raised the interest rates five times since
June in an effort to slow the economic growth and prevent
inflation from escalating.
</P>
<P>
The construction report said that spending on all private
construction projects grew by 2 percent in February to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 579.6 billion dollars,
reflecting higher spending on commercial and some residential
projects.
</P>
<P>
Among private projects, spending on all nonresidential, or
commercial building such as factory plants and hotels, rose 4.8
percent to 197 billion dollars. Meanwhile, spending on all
residential projects rose by 0.6 percent to a rate of 340.7
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The report also showed that spending on big government projects
fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 179.2 billion dollars
in February.

<HEADLINE> Annan On His Report For Millennium Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 3 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said on Monday that his report for the Millennium Summit was
aimed to provide that gathering with a basic document to work from.
</P>
<P>
Annan today launched his Millennium Report entitled "We the
peoples: The Role of the United Nations in the 21st Century" in
which he set out a practical vision for the United Nations in a
globalized world.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the General Assembly to explain his
Millennium Report, Annan said "In it, I have attempted to identify
the main challenges that face us, as we enter the twenty-first
century, and to sketch out an action plan for addressing them."
</P>
<P>
On the global issues, Annan said he had grouped them under
three headings, freedom from want, freedom from fear and freedom
from future generations to sustain their lives on this planet.
</P>
<P>
"First, Freedom from want. How can we call human beings free
and equal in dignity when over a billion of them are struggling to
survive on less than one dollar a say, without safe drinking water,
and when half of all humanity lacks adequate sanitation?" the U.N.
chief said.
</P>
<P>
"Unless we redouble and concert our efforts, poverty and
inequality will get worse still, since world population will grow
by a further two billion in the next quarter-century, with almost
all the increase in the poorest countries," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"The second main heading in the Report is freedom from fear.
Wars between States are mercifully less frequent than they used to
be. But in the last decade internal wars have claimed more than
five million lives, and driven many times that number of people
from their homes. Moreover, we still live under the shadow of
weapons of mass destruction," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"Both these threats, I believe, require us to think of
security less in terms of merely defending territory, and more in
terms of protecting people. That means we must tackle the threat
of deadly conflict at every stage in the process," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The third is freedom of future generations to sustain their
lives on this planet," the U.N. chief said.
</P>
<P>
"Even now, many of us have not understood how seriously that
freedom is threatened. The environment was never seriously
considered," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I should say we are plundering our children 's heritage to
pay for our present unsustainable practices. This must stop. We
must reduce emissions of carbon and other "greenhouse gases", to
put a stop to global warming. Implementing the Kyoto Protocol is a
vital first step," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Millennium Summit of the United Nations will be held from 6
to 8 September in New York.

<HEADLINE> Outlook For World Wheat Production In 2000/01 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- On the basis of information
currently available world wheat production is forecast at 590
million tons, compared with 584 million in 1999, according to the
International Grains Council (IGC).
</P>
<P>
Significant increases in area are expected in some major
growing regions, and underlie projected rises in output in the EC,
Russia, Canada and Argentina, the IGC added.
</P>
<P>
The volume of world wheat trade will largely depend on the
outcome of the new season's harvests, especially in a year when
stocks in some key importers are at low levels.
</P>
<P>
It is believed renewed economic growth and recent increases in
oil prices, if maintained, could boost demand in various countries.
</P>
<P>
At his early stage, the IGC said the world wheat trade in 2000/
01 is projected at 102 million tons, compared with the estimate of
104 million for 1999/2000.
</P>
<P>
World wheat consumption is forecast at a record 600 million
tons with food use at 442 million. Population growth remains the
strongest long-term influence, the IGC said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Launches Ambitious 21st Century Action Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 3 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary-
General Kofi Annan launched here Monday a detailed report setting
the agenda for the U.N. Millennium Summit scheduled for early
September, setting an ambitious 21st century action plan for all
member nations.
</P>
<P>
In the 58-page report, entitled "We the People: The Role of
the United Nations in the 21st Century", Annan called on all
member states to commit themselves to ending poverty and
inequality, improving education, increasing security, reducing HIV/
AIDS and protecting the environment.
</P>
<P>
The report, designed to set out a practical vision for the
United Nations in a globalized world, will be considered by the
Millennium Summit, the largest-ever gathering of heads of state or
government, to be held from September 6 to 8.
</P>
<P>
Among its key concepts is the need to make globalization more
inclusive, to create more opportunities for all and not leave
entire continents and billions of people behind in squalor.
</P>
<P>
"The benefits of globalization remain highly concentrated
among a relatively small number of countries and are spread
unevenly within them, "said the Secretary-General.
</P>
<P>
The report observes that globalization has eluded Africa,
where many of the world's poor live, including up to 40 million
children who will be orphans by 2010, largely because of HIV/AIDS.
In addition, growth is anemic, trade and investment are low, and
national debts are crushing.
</P>
<P>
While there were strong and well enforced rules facilitating
the expansion of global markets, efforts to secure equally valid
social objectives such as labor standards, the environment, human
rights or poverty reduction, had lagged behind, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
On conflicts and peacekeeping, the U.N. chief said that
nations must address both old and new threats.
</P>
<P>
There are still too many nuclear weapons, as well as a growing
proliferation of small arms that serve to prolong and deepen
already vicious conflicts, he explained.
</P>
<P>
Peace operations must be strengthened, while sanctions should
be better targeted, to make them "less harsh on innocent
populations, and more effective in penalizing delinquent rulers,"
Annan stressed.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general has recently announced the setup of a
special international panel to reevaluate the peace operations the
U.N. has taken in the past 50 years and find ways to better
functions in the next century. The panel is preparing a separate
report on the subject to be submitted to the Millennium Summit for
consideration.
</P>
<P>
On environmental issues, Annan called for a "new ethic of
stewardship" and a system of "green accounting" to ensure that
environmental costs and benefits are integrated into economic
policies.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general sought commitments from nations to an
ambitious agenda, which includes that:
</P>
<P>
By 2015, people living in extreme poverty and the proportion
lacking safe and affordable water will be cut in half, all
children will be able to complete primary education and the gender
gap at all levels of education will be eliminated;
</P>
<P>
Within 10 years, HIV infection rates for persons 15-24 years
old will be reduced by 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
By 2020, the lives of 100 million slum dwellers will be
improved.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the industrialized countries to grant free
market access for goods produced in poor countries, cancel all
official debts of the heavily indebted poor countries in return
for those countries making demonstrable commitment to poverty
reduction.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief strongly recommended that new information
technology play a major role in fighting poverty and promoting
human development as well as improving U.N. operations.
</P>
<P>
He announced setting up a network of 10,000 online sites to
provide medical information to hospitals and clinics throughout
the developing world, a consortium of high tech volunteer corps
called United Nations Information Technology Service (UNITeS) and
a disaster response initiative.
</P>
<P>
Annan also proposed an ambitious series of changes for the
United Nations itself, pointing to the expansion of its 15-nation
Security Council and the veto right of the five permanent member
nations.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the U.N. General Assembly designated its 55th session,
starting on September 5, as the Millennium Assembly and decided to
hold the Millennium Summit.
</P>
<P>
As part of the preparations for the gathering, five regional
hearings have been held to define the agenda.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior U.N. official, who declined to be
identified, the summiteers would be divided into four groups to
discuss a common agenda. A declaration is expected to be released
at the end of the three-day summit.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. expert believed that it is important to set clear and
well-defined goals for the summit, but what is more significant is
to follow up afterward. "Endless meetings and empty talks will
lead to nowhere," he said.

<HEADLINE> Ottawa Valley Sees Gold Rush  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Ottawa Valley is seeing a gold rush
with local high-tech firms landing 233 million Canadian dollars (
about 161 million U.S. dollars) in venture capital for the first
three months of the year, the Ottawa Citizen newspaper said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Four deals to be unveiled later this month will add another 100
million Canadian dollars (about 69 million U.S. dollars) in new
venture capital investment.
</P>
<P>
The "seed investments" are impressive compared with last year,
when the region's entire industry attracted a total of 220 million
Canadian dollars (about 152 million U.S. dollars), according to
the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The rapid influx of venture financing has made the national
capital region an investment destination accounting for 30 percent
of an estimated 800 million dollars (about 552 million U.S.
dollars) plus in new deals in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
That was second only to Toronto, the country's biggest city,
where high-tech firms attracted more than 35 percent of the total
estimated investment.
</P>
<P>
A large chunk of the fresh venture capital originates in the
United States, where 20 investors - mostly from the Boston and San
Francisco areas - contributed to the first-quarter flood of
investment in the Ottawa area, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The gold rush is a result of fierce competition between venture
firms, which have been busy targeting startups in the United
States for most of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
For the moment, outside venture capitalists are taking notice
of the Ottawa area, where competition is comparatively less with
dozens of startups already located to attract financing,
especially from the United States.
</P>
<P>
Venture capital firms are raising a record amount of new money
from investors eager to cash in on the high-tech boom. These
financial mercenaries are responding, in turn, to the exceptional
returns generated by those startups in high-tech niches from data
networking to fibre-optics.
</P>
<P>
They earn their money by investing in a high-tech firm during
its earliest stage, then selling their stake when the startup gets
bought by a larger player or goes public, said the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Iran Urges International Cooperation Against Drug Trafficking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Vice President for Executive
Affairs Mohammad Hashemi on Monday called on the international
community to join hands with the Iranian government in a campaign
against drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to foreign envoys based in Tehran, Hashemi said Iran
confiscated over 253 tons of narcotics in 1999, including six tons
of heroin, 22 tons of morphine, 204 tons of opium, 18 tons of
hashish and three tons of others.
</P>
<P>
He said that during 1998 and 1999, a large majority of the
opium, heroin and morphine seizures had been made in Iran since it
borders the largest drugs producer in the world, the Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Hashemi said that Iran has taken effective steps to promote
bilateral and multilateral cooperation to universalize the anti-
drug campaign, including the opening of the office of the United
Nations Drug Control Program (UNDCP) in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, an effective campaign against the global
threat of drug trafficking needs more funds and equipment, which
Iran is not able to obtain alone.
</P>
<P>
Iran has taken necessary measures at the national level in the
framework of a national program of the year 2000 and has drawn a
multi-dimensional plan with a budget of 3,250 billion rials (about
1.08 billion U.S. dollars), he said.
</P>
<P>
However, due to financial problems and limitations, the Iranian
government was only able to allocate 300 million dollars for the
plan, he added.
</P>
<P>
Iran is a main transit route for drugs smuggled from
Afghanistan, the world's largest opium producer, and neighboring
Pakistan to Europe and oil-rich Gulf Arab states.
</P>
<P>
Iran launched the strict anti-drug campaign in 1989 after the
Iranian Majlis or parliament passed an anti-drug law authorizing
capital punishment for drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
A commander of the Iranian security forces said last November
that the country had spent one billion dollars on combating drug
trafficking since the Islamic revolution in 1979.

<HEADLINE> Iran Seeks Oil Output Hike Without Harming Market: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar
Zanganeh said here on Monday that Iran seeks an oil output hike to
preserve its share in the world oil market but will not go for a
production rise which may ruin the market.
</P>
<P>
Iran is seeking a rise in oil production given the market
realities, Zanganeh stressed, adding its policy of not flooding the
market with additional oil does not mean that Iran will not
increase its production.
</P>
<P>
Refuting as baseless allegations that Iran is not able to
increase its oil production, Zanganeh said Iran has increased the
average oil production since the start of this month to preserve
its share in the world market.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister did not disclose how many barrels Iran
would add to its current output of about 3.3 million barrels per
day, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
There should be timely supplies of crude oil to meet market
demand, he said, but there is no shortage of oil in the world oil
market in the first quarter of the current year. Therefore, oil
should not suddenly enter the market, he added.
</P>
<P>
Despite Iran and Iraq opposition, nine of the 11 members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) agreed in
Vienna at Tuesday to boost oil production by 6.3 percent, or a
total of 1.45 million barrels a day from April 1.
</P>
<P>
Iran initially did not sign the agreement, insisting that it was
a bow to U.S. pressure to bring down oil prices which almost
tripled since oil producers enforced an output curb in March 1999.
</P>
<P>
However, Iran announced one day later that it would increase oil
production for fear of losing market share. Under Tuesday's
agreement, Iran should raise its oil production by 264,000 barrels
a day, thus enabling the cartel to boost total output by 7.5
percent over the ceiling set when it cut production last year.
</P>
<P>
Iran wants OPEC members to safeguard their long-term interests
and the survival of the cartel depends on the spirit of cooperation
and interaction among its members, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that OPEC members are fully independent and should
not make any decision under external pressure.
</P>
<P>
He said that from the economic point of view there was no need
to a single stage increase in production level, so Iran could not
accept such an irrational decision making.
</P>
<P>
He noted, however, that Iran believes in unity and consolidation
among OPEC member states and will strive to strengthen the
organization.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
Monday urged African and European leaders to capitalize on
relationship of the past and to develop ties of the present.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak made the appeal in his inaugural speech at the first
Africa-Europe Summit that opened here Monday with an aim to forge a
new and strategic relationship between the two continents.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the changes and achievements made in Africa, Mubarak
said that Africa has witnessed during the past decade the efforts
to establish pillars of democracy, freedom, the respect for human
rights and the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed Africa should integrate itself in the economic
globalization and get along with the international changes.
</P>
<P>
"So the African leaders should take decisions for the
establishment of African federation programs and parliament," he
added.
</P>
<P>
He also hailed the declaration of the year 2000 as the year of
peace in Africa and called for the holding of the initial "
ministerial meeting in relation to security, stability, development
and cooperation in Africa."
</P>
<P>
Seven of the 15 EU members are former colonial powers in Africa
and the EU gives 15 billion U.S. dollars to Africa every five
years, more than any other single source.
</P>
<P>
Most African leaders hoped to exploit the summit to seek debts
reduction or cancellation, more financial aid and investment from
the rich Europe, their major creditor and trading partner.
</P>
<P>
The total external debts of African states reached 350 billion
dollars, with them spending 23 billion dollars, or 30.9 percent of
their exports to service the debt every year.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak in his speech called on the European creditors to help
ease the debt burden.
</P>
<P>
Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Guetrres, whose country
initiated the summit and is holding the EU presidency, said in the
ensuing address "it is our profound wish that this most meaningful
occasion should represent a moment of renewal in the relationship
between our two neighboring continents."
</P>
<P>
Heads of state or government or their representatives from 66
African and EU states attended the two-day summit to discuss

<HEADLINE> Marginalizing Africa "unacceptable": Portuguese PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Portugal's Prime Minister Antonio
Guterres warned on Monday that Africa is being marginalized in the
age of globalization.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed the marginalization of Africa is "unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
Guterres made the remarks ahead of the first Africa-Europe
summit that opened Monday afternoon in the International Conference
Center in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The exports of the African countries accounted for 6 percent of
the world's total years ago, but the figure has declined to less
than 2 percent now, he added.
</P>
<P>
There is "a very urgent need" for Africa to integrate itself
into the global economy and Europe has "a major role" to play in
this respect, said Guterres, whose country is holding EU's rotating
presidency.
</P>
<P>
The Africa-Europe summit is opportune for the start of a
political dialog at the highest level, he said. And this is not a
mere historic conference, but the beginning of a continuous march,
he added.
</P>
<P>
The African and European sides have agreed on the formation of a
technical body to convene on a regular basis, the holding of a
ministerial meeting and organizing a second summit in 2003, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The international community must adopt an effective support
program that would open the markets of developed countries to the
exports of the poor states and transfer technology and investments
to them, Guterres said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Pathak, who was there to commission India's first home-made
fleet replenishment tanker, was quoted by the Press Trust of India
(PTI) as saying that his ministry has already taken steps to
modernize all the 39 ordnance factories in the country in a phased
manner in a bid to improve quality and production.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters at the Indian East Naval Command in
Visakhapatnam that the production has been increased from 70
percent to 300 percent in some of the ordnance factories.
</P>
<P>
The Indian government had allocated a total of 12.41 billion
rupees (288.6 million U.S. dollars) for defense production in the
Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1997-2002), while in the 10th Five-
Year Plan period the figure is expected to be raised to 19 billion
rupees (441.86 million dollars), he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the PTI, the newly-built INS Atidya fleet
replenishment tanker, manufactured by Garden Rach Ship Builders
and Engineers Limited in Calcutta, is capable of fueling as many
as six ships at a time.
</P>
<P>
Pathak said that another tanker, INS Brahmaputra, would also be
handed over to the Western Naval Command this month. The shipyard
is also building two more submarines for the navy.

<HEADLINE> Call for Estrada's Resignation Fails to Gain Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Senate Minority Leader
Teofisto Guingona wrote President Joseph Estrada a letter on
Monday,asking him to step down "since the country is already in
disarray."
</P>
<P>
Guingona cited the lack of a sustained program of development,
the worsening unemployment situation, the continued depreciation
of the peso, and the bloodshed in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
However, the senator's call failed to gain support so far, even
from his own partymates in Lakas-NUCD.
</P>
<P>
In separate interviews, Senators Juan Flavier, Loren Legarda,
Robert Barbers and Rene Cayetano all stressed that Guingona's open
letter to President Estrada was not a party decision.
</P>
<P>
the Lakas senators said Estrada's resignation from his post is
not necessary, adding that the president should be given more time
to address the concerns raised by those discontented with his
leadership.
</P>
<P>
Senate President Blas Ople, on the other hand, advised Guingona
to seek psychiatric help, noting that his call for President
Estrada's resignation is a clear sign of "lapses" in his mental
health.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying Senator Guingona is stupid. I'm saying his
statement is," Ople said, as he questioned the wisdom of seeking
President Estrada's resignation when he was elected by an
overwhelming majority of the voting public in the 1998 polls.

<HEADLINE> Recovered Cambodian Artifacts on Display </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The 122 looted pieces of arts
recently recovered from Thailand were on display Monday at the
National Museum as part of the Second National Culture's Day
celebrations.
</P>
<P>
The artifacts, pillaged from the 12-century-old Banteay Chhmar
Temple in northwestern Cambodia, included three heads of giant,
one garuda, one stone inscription and 117 pieces of base relief.
</P>
<P>
Thai authorities handed over the temple reliefs and other
artifacts to Cambodian officials at Poipet, the border town 350
kilometers northwest of Phnom Penh, on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony of the Khmer Artifacts Exhibition, Sar
Kheng,deputy prime minister and minister of interior, called on
the whole nation to preserve and protect the national culture.
</P>
<P>
He also appealed to all departments involved with national
culture and patrimony not to cash in on these ancient temples, but
focus on the preservation and renovation of as many temples as
possible.
</P>
<P>
The recovered artifacts will be exhibited for about two months
as part of government's campaign to raise public awareness about
the need to stop the pillage of Cambodia's cultural heritage.
</P>
<P>
Built between the 9th and 13th centuries, the ancient temples
are a symbol of Cambodian national pride and the country's biggest
tourist attraction. But looting and lack of security have damaged
the temples seriously.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Hopes to Push Forward Peace Negotiations in Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
Monday expressed his hope that peace negotiations aimed at ending
the 17-year-old civil war in Sudan would go ahead and reach an
acceptable conclusion.
</P>
<P>
Moi made the remarks when he had lengthy discussions with
Sudanese President Hassan El Bashir in Cairo, Egypt, where they
are attending the Afro-European Summit which opened Monday
afternoon, the Presidential Press Service said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
During the discussions, Bashir said that his country has faith
in President Moi's leadership of the Inter-governmental Authority
on Development (Igad) peace initiative for southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Both presidents agreed that other parallel initiative or forms
of external interference in the peace process for southern Sudan
would not be helpful and should be discouraged.
</P>
<P>
Moi said that he hoped that discussions regarding the question
of state and religion and secular government in Sudan would be
solved positively during this round of talks.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that the Sudanese government and southern
rebels would resume talks on Monday in Kenya's capital Nairobi
after several rounds of fruitless peace talks under the auspices
of Igad.

<HEADLINE> Obuchi in Coma, Japanese Cabinet to Resign En Masse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese cabinet will most
likely have to resign en masse as Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi is
in a coma in an intensive care unit after suffering a stroke
Sunday, acting Prime Minister Mikio Aoki said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"At this point, it's difficult for the premier to make his own
decisions," Aoki told a press conference. "We will have to decide
what to do after considering his condition," he added.
</P>
<P>
A government source said the resignation would come within a
day or two.
</P>
<P>
Yoshiro Mori, secretary general of Obuchi's ruling Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP) and the party's No. 2 figure, is being
tipped as a possible successor to Obuchi, Kyodo News quoted LDP
sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The LDP and its coalition partner, the New Komeito party, were
expected to complete the selection process for a candidate by the
end of the week, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi was taken to the private Juntendo University Hospital in
Tokyo at around 1 a.m. Sunday. He was later moved to the
hospital's intensive care unit after his condition worsened at
around 7:30 p.m., Aoki said.
</P>
<P>
Doctors at the hospital put Obuchi on an artificial respirator
at 9:50 p.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The premier's blood pressure is stable, but his condition is
very unpredictable," the top Japanese government spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Aoki, who was named as acting prime minister by the Japanese
government Monday morning, said he accepted the post because
doctors told him Obuchi would be unable to leave the hospital for
at least two or three days.
</P>
<P>
The government's announcement on Obuchi's hospitalization came
nearly a full day after it took place. His illness was initially
described as fatigue from overwork.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi's illness is certain to complicate Japan's political
schedule, including the timing of a general election for the House
of Representatives (lower house), which must be held by mid-
October.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi, as prime minister, has the prerogative of dissolving
the lower house for an election. He was considering how timing of
such an action could work to his political advantage.
</P>
<P>
But illness is seen likely to limit his options, and makes it
difficult for him to lead a political scenario, political analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
As the acting prime minister could not dissolve the lower house,
so unless Obuchi returns to work or someone succeeds him
officially, the lower house will not be dissolved until its term
runs out in October, said an analyst.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi's hospitalization is also expected to have an impact
upon the Japanese government's preparations for the Group of Eight
(G-8) summit to be held in Okinawa in July.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi's prolonged illness could have an adverse effect on
Japan's economy if the current Diet (parliament) session is unable
to proceed smoothly to completion.
</P>
<P>
The fiscal 2000 budget has been already approved by the Diet,
but related spending measures must have Diet approval for the
appropriations to actually take effect.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi had been busy dealing with last week's eruptions of Mt.
Usu on Japan's northernmost main island Hokkaido.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Obuchi held talks with the leaders of the New
Komeito and the Liberal Party over the breakup of his tripartite
alliance.

<TEXT>
<P>
Seoul, April 3 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim Dae-jung
said Monday his country sticks to one China policy and will never
change it as Taiwan is an inseparable part of China.
</P>
<P>
The President made the remark here during a meeting with Zeng
Qinghong, head of the Organization Department of the Chinese
Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
Kim also praised China for playing an important role in
maintaining peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Kim noted that the prospects for further developing South
Korean-Chinese ties will be much better as the two nations have
achieved a great deal in the fields of politics, economy, military,
culture and tourism since the establishment of diplomatic
relations in 1992.
</P>
<P>
In response, Zeng spoke highly of South Korea's adhering to one
China policy and expounded the Chinese government's principle and
position on the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
China and South Korea have established cooperative partnership
oriented toward the 21st century in 1998 when President Kim Dae-
jung visited China, said Zeng, who is an alternative member of the
political bureau of the Chinese Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
Zeng, who arrived here for a four-day visit last Saturday at
the invitation of the South Korean government, has met South
Korean Prime Minister Park Tae-joon and other government officials
and political leaders.
</P>
<P>
Zeng will leave here for Tokyo tomorrow. South Korea is the
third leg of his Asia-Pacific region's visit, which has taken him
to Australia and New Zealand.

BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- A prairie fire which had been
creeping into China from Mongolia since Sunday was put out this
morning, according to the Agriculture Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The fire broke out on March 27 in an area of grassland of
Mongolia some 80 km north of the Chinese border. At 16:20 pm on
April 2, it entered the Hulun Buir League in China's Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region and created a serious threat.
</P>
<P>
The local government mobilized a large number of firefighters,
who finally succeeded in putting out the fire at 2:15 am today.
</P>
<P>
However, the ministry said that another fire is still raging
along the Sino-Mongolian border. Leading officials of the ministry
have flown to Inner Mongolia to oversee the fire-precaution work
there.

Results of the poll released Monday showed that 60 percent of
the respondents were satisfied with the present situation, higher
than the 44 percent recorded in a similar survey held in January.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether Hong Kong would continue to be prosperous
and stable, 71 percent said they were confident, up from 67
percent recorded in January.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more respondents (41 percent) than before (30
percent) expressed satisfaction with the overall performance of
the SAR government.
</P>
<P>
An HAB spokesman said the positive responses may have been
influenced by the generally well-received budget delivered just
before the survey period and other signs of economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
The survey also revealed that the three problems which were
mentioned most often, in the order of priority, were labor,
economy and education-related problems.
</P>
<P>
The percentage of people who worried about education has gone
up from 13 per cent in January to 18 per cent.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Can Turkey's Coalition Trio Weather Crisis? by Huai Chengbo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit
is to hold a summit of his three coalition partners Monday in a bid
to cobble the shattering coalition after his bill on constitutional
amendment failed to be approved by the parliament last week.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Ecevit and Delvet Bahceli, the deputy prime
minister and chairman of the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP), will
ask Mesut Yilmaz, chairman of the Motherland Party (ANAP), the
coalition's junior partner, to make a last-minute appeal for his
deputies to vote in favor of the presidential amendment in
Wednesday's second voting.
</P>
<P>
In the first, secret voting Wednesday night, Ecevit's bill on a
constitutional change to allow President Suleyman Demirel, whose
single seven-year term expires on May 16 this year, to stay on for
a second, five-year term, only got 303 "yes" votes, far short of
the required minimum of 330 votes for an amendment to be
legislated.  The government's failure in parliament was blamed
mainly on a serious ANAP defection in the voting despite that the
coalition partners had agreed that they would back the bill.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts here are becoming more and more inclined to
believe that unless something dramatic happens in the next 48 hours
before Wednesday's vote, the bid ardently pushed by Ecevit is dead
and the real debate is whether or not the current coalition can
survive given serious confidence crisis.
</P>
<P>
The ANAP deputies who oppose Demirel will presumably remain
defiant and will not change their votes unless they are forced to
declare their preferences during the voting to the party leader, a
move which would violate parliamentary rules. The balloting for
constitutional amendment is handled in a secret way and parties are
not supposed to force their deputies to toe the party line.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, hopes that the main opposition Virtue Party (FP) will
make a last-minute U-turn and support the bill are vanishing. FP
leader Recai Kutan accused Ecevit over the weekend of neglecting
key problems at the expense of reforming the presidency.
</P>
<P>
The government tried to woo the FP by linking the Demirel vote
with another constitutional amendment that would make it harder for
parties to be closed down by the supreme court. The FP is currently
facing a closure case on charges of being a hub of anti-secular and
pro-fundamentalist activities.
</P>
<P>
The reformist wing in the FP has also made it clear that they
stand against any bargaining for the current constitutional
amendments with the government. They claim that if Demirel leaves
office, the winds of change and democratic reform will gain
momentum.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some opposition True Path Party (DYP) deputies are
obviously unwilling to let Demirel at the Presidential Palace any
longer, hoping that if the 76-year-old president returns home among
the DYP ranks, he may revamp the DYP and dismiss Tansu Ciller as
chairperson.
</P>
<P>
Thus, earlier predictions that most DYP deputies would vote for
Demirel are uncertain, to say the least.
</P>
<P>
Taking into consideration these factors, many observers have
come to realize that Demirel's departure from presidency is a
foregone conclusion.
</P>
<P>
Now all eyes are on Ecevit, who did some brain-storming during
his just-concluded four-day visit to India about the future of his
coalition, holds the key to the fate of the government.
</P>
<P>
There are widespread speculations that Ecevit and Bahceli might
be prepared to kick out ANAP and form a two-party minority
government with backing from Ciller's DYP.
</P>
<P>
There are also some allegations that some of ANAP deputies, who
are reluctant to leave the government, may be willing to defect and
join the MHP, thus bolstering the strength of a new government.
</P>
<P>
The two parties, whose popularity has been on the rise according
to recent public opinion polls, may also want to capitalize on this
and push for early elections.
</P>
<P>
Should the parliament fail to elect a president in four rounds
by May 16, it would be automatically dissolved and early elections
would be held within 90 days.
</P>
<P>
However, MHP Parliamentary Group Chairman Omer Izgi claimed
Sunday that he still believes that ANAP deputies and 100 FP
deputies will vote for Demirel on Wednesday and the constitutional
amendment package will have an easy ride winning more than 367
votes for it to become law immediately signed by the president.
</P>
<P>
But he could not explain why many MHP ministers in the cabinet
publicly stated that last week's vote had shown that "Demirel's
term in office will not be extended."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Not to Deploy Troops in South Lebanon: Cohen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States will not send
troops to fill the vacuum areas in south Lebanon after Israeli
soldiers withdraw by July, visiting U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference after meeting with Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak Monday morning, Cohen also revealed that
no final decisions had been made about the future of any
international presence in the buffer area.
</P>
<P>
Even if U.N. peacekeepers would be sent to ensure the quiet
along the border between Israel and Lebanon, Cohen suggested, U.S.
soldiers will not participate.
</P>
<P>
Barak played down the idea of an international peacekeeping
force in the zone, which had been promoted by Israeli officials in
the past few weeks to guard against possible cross-border attacks
from south Lebanon on Israel's northern border communities after
its troop withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Barak clarified his stand on the issue by saying that the
expansion of U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), if there is
such a plan, will not be significant.
</P>
<P>
The UNIFIL has been in the region since Israel's first invasion
of Lebanon in 1978. Israel officials had expressed hopes that the
force could be expended from its current defense areas to fill in
the zone vacated by Israel Defense Forces (IDF).
</P>
<P>
The 4,500-strong peacekeeping troops from nine countries
currently deployed primarily in the western and central sectors of
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Barak stated Monday that he didn't think that there was any need
for adding extra nations, which are not in UNIFIL now, to the
multi-national forces.
</P>
<P>
The statement excluded U.S. and France, who are not in UNIFIL,
from joining any future expansion of the international buffer
troops.
</P>
<P>
France, another pivotal side mediating between Israel, and
Syrian and Lebanon because of its historical links to the two Arab
counties, has agreed to send soldiers during French Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin's visit here last month, on condition of an peace
deal with Syria, the major power broker in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Barak emphasized that the current size of UNIFIL is sufficient
for peacekeeping in the area as long as Lebanon acts to disarming
other militias in the zone. He was referring to Lebanese Hezbollah,
the Shiite Muslim militant group fighting to end the Israeli
occupation since the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there will be any problems (in dismantling
Hezbollah). If there will be a will, there will be a way to solve
the issue with UNIFIL under the auspice of U.N. Security Council,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Barak reiterated his pledge that he would withdraw Israeli
troops from south Lebanon by July, ending an 18-year Israeli
occupation.
</P>
<P>
Warning against possible heat-up in the northern border areas
after the July pullback, Barak said Israel is the strongest country
in the region and he doubted whether any country would attempt to
test its strength.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a 15-kilometer-deep "security zone" in south
Lebanon in 1985 with a proclaimed aim of preventing cross-border
guerrilla attacks on its north. But mounting Israeli casualties
have spurred a growing public pressure for a pullout. 
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet on March 5 gave backing to Barak's pledge to
withdraw from south Lebanon by July, with or without a peace deal
with Syria or Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian talks, which resumed last December after a
45-month break, stumbled again in January over a dispute over the
fate of the Golan Heights, a strategic Syrian plateau seized by
Israel in the 1967 Middle East war. 
</P>
<P>
Some strategy experts believe Israel hopes the announcement of
possible unilateral withdrawal would make the Syrians lose their
last bargaining chip and force them to return to the negotiating
table. 
</P>
<P>
However, Israel's wishful thinking was dampened by Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad, whose summit meeting with U.S. President
Bill Clinton in Geneva on March 26 failed to produce any progress
as expected. The summit was once regarded as the last chance for
reviving the talks. 
</P>
<P>
To face this reality, Israeli leaders had to mull more seriously
than before about their plans to carry out the redeployment
unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
In the past few weeks, Israel has been seeking support from U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Clinton and the European Union (EU)
for the idea of deploying a multi-national buffer troops in the
vacuum areas or expanding the UNIFIL institution.
</P>
<P>
However, diplomats in Jerusalem said EU states are unlikely to
offer troops to join such an army unless there is a security
agreement with Syria to avoid the risk of bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
Finland and Ireland, who currently serve in the UNIFIL, had
signaled their intention of pulling out if it is expanded to the
whole security zone.
</P>
<P>
To add Israel's embarrassment, Lebanese Defense Minister Ghazi
Zuetir announced last Saturday to the effect that Beirut might ask
Damascus to send troops to south Lebanon in the event of a
unilateral Israeli pullout.
</P>
<P>
The suggestion later was rejected by Syrian Foreign Minister
Faruk Shareh, whose country deploys some 35,000 troops in Lebanon
since 1976.
</P>
<P>
To garner support from Washington, Barak raised the issue during
his meeting with Cohen, who made Israel as the first stop of his
annual trip to friendly states of U.S. in the Middle East region.
</P>
<P>
Cohen arrived in Israel Sunday evening after a brief stop and
will also visit Jordan, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the
United Arab Emirates and Oman during his two-week tour.
</P>
<P>
One of Cohen's objectives of the multi-leg trip, according to
Israeli officials, is to examine how to build a broader security
network to enable Middle East allies to collaborate in countering
joint threats like terrorism and possible biological and chemical
warfare.
</P>
<P>
He also wanted to discuss with Israeli leaders military
cooperation between the two countries, the 17-billion-U.S.-dollar
U.S. defense assistance which Israel wants to accompany any peace
deal with Syria, and other security issues concerning the peace
process.

terrorist group Hezbollah in southeastern Diyarbakir province.
</P>
<P>
The excavations started after a Hezbollah member was captured in
Cinar town of the province and told the police that there were dead
bodies in an empty field in the area, the Anatolia News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has launched a massive crackdown across the country since
last year on Hezbollah, which Ankara accuses of seeking to turn
overwhelmingly Muslim but secular Turkey into a strict Islam-ruled
country by resorting to violent and terrorist means.
</P>
<P>
During the day, nine Hezbollah members were also arrested in the
southeastern Gaziantep province.
</P>
<P>
They were charged with engaging in propaganda activities for the
terrorist group in mosques to recruit new members.
</P>
<P>
Two rifles, 25 discs, cassettes and books were seized during the
operations which were still underway in the region, said the
report.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Doctor Develops Medicine for Prostate Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- A Turkish doctor has developed a
kind of medicine which can kill cancerous prostate cells without
damaging the healthy tissues in the gland, the Anatolia News Agency
reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The medicine, called Aptosyn (Exisulind), has been proved
effective in treating large intestines cancer as well, said the
inventor Rifat Pamukcu at the American Research Association's
Conference.
</P>
<P>
Pamukcu, who acts as the vice president of the Cell Pathway
Company in Pennsylvania, the U.S., said Aptosyn functions by
reducing the androgen receptor concentration and eliminating the
effect of cancerous cells.
</P>
<P>
Aptosyn causes the cancerous cells to commit suicide and
therefore eradicates them without harming the healthy tissues in
the prostate, the doctor said.
</P>
<P>
The results of clinical tests on people will be announced during
the American Urology Congress to be held in Atlanta on May 1.
</P>
<P>
Pamukcu said the medicine had been tested on 96 patients, whose
prostate cancer recurred following a prostate operation.
</P>
<P>
Cell Pathway has applied to the U.S. Health Department for
permission to use Aptosyn on patients who also suffer from large
intestines cancer.
</P>
<P>
The medicine which is currently studied by the U.S. Health
Department, can soon be used in treating polyposis on patients with
large intestines cancer, said the report.

<HEADLINE> No Polio Case Detected in Western Pacific for 3 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The Western Pacific Region has not
reported any new cases of indigenous poliomyelitis for three
consecutive years, the biggest landmark on the road to
certification of the region as free from poliomyelitis.
</P>
<P>
This was declared here Monday by Shigeru Omi, Regional Director
of the World Health Organization (WHO) Western Pacific Region.
</P>
<P>
"This is a tremendous achievement for all countries of the
region,"Omi told the 10th meeting of the WHO Western Pacific
Regional Technical Advisory Group on the expanded program on
immunization and poliomyelitis eradication held from April 2 to 3.
</P>
<P>
Countries of the region are very confident that they are not
missing any poliomyelitis cases because over 18,000 children with
acute flaccid paralysis have been investigated during the last
three years, yet no indigenous poliovirus has been detected.
</P>
<P>
The Regional Certification Commission, an independent body
whose eight members were also present at the meeting, will have
the ultimate responsibility to decide whether the Western Pacific
Region can be certified as poliomyelitis-free later this year.

<HEADLINE> Manila Unfazed Over Increasing Foreign Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Monday that the country's increasing foreign debt stock will
enable the government to manage public expenditure more wisely and
to gain access to cash resources to fund its pro-poor programs.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Spokesman Jerry Barican stressed that this "
therefore augurs well for public expenditure management in terms
of lower cost of domestic borrowing and the availability of cash
resources for budgetary purposes."
</P>
<P>
As of December 31, 1999, the country's foreign debt amounted to
52.2 billion U.S. dollars, or about 65 percent of the GNP(gross
national product), which is six percentage points lower than the
1998 level, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"There is thus an improvement in the country's capacity to pay
its debt," Barican pointed out in a statement.
</P>
<P>
According to Barican, the "increase in magnitude from the 1998
level of 47.8 billion dollars by 9.2 percent is explained by the
significant increase in bond flotations by the public sector."
</P>
<P>
He said the rise in budget deficit in 1999 prompted the
government to avail of relatively cheaper foreign money in order
to beef up its available cash resources.
</P>
<P>
This strategy, Barican said, enabled the government to generate
a buffer against any unforeseen financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"It also puts the government in a position to contain any
upward pressure against the low prevailing cost of domestic
borrowing," he added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman assured the public that the government does
careful programming and observes judicious releases of budgetary
allotment in accordance with the annual appropriation.

JOHANNESBURG, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The threat of starvation in
parts of eastern Africa is severe with nearly 16 million people in
need of emergency food assistance, South African Press Association
reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Pastoral areas, including southeastern Ethiopia, northern Kenya
and several parts of Somalia, are particularly affected due to
successive years of poor rains with loss of large numbers of
livestock, a report released by the United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization said.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia is the hardest hit with more than eight million people
at risk, while in Kenya nearly 2.7 million people are facing
severe food shortage, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"Poor rainfall is forecast in the Sub-Sahara region for the
current season, so the number of people in need of assistance is
anticipated to increase," the report said.
</P>
<P>
It said that "only a massive international effort in the coming
months in support of these populations can avert further human
suffering and loss of life."
</P>
<P>
The Great Lakes region is also reported to be facing a massive
food supply shortage due to civil strife, insecurity, shortage of
inputs and erratic rainfall.
</P>
<P>
In Mozambique, it is estimated that 1.9 million people are
affected by the flood disaster. Major losses of crops and
livestock are sustained in the southern and central provinces of
Maputo, Gaza, Inhambane, Manica and Sofala.
</P>
<P>
In Madagascar, heavy rains and high winds from two consecutive
cyclones caused destruction to property and infrastructure and

JOHANNESBURG, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The Lesotho government
announced on Monday that it will establish a special commission to
investigate the disturbances in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The country's acting Prime Minister Kelebone Maope told the
National Assembly that the commission will consist of three judges
of the Lesotho Court of Appeal, according to a report by South
African Press Association.
</P>
<P>
The commission will undertake an in-depth investigation into
the causes of the disturbances from July to November 1998 and find
out who were the instigators of violence, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government has appealed to everyone who knows
anything about the disturbances to cooperate with the commission
in order that the truth be exposed.
</P>

The commission is expected to start its investigations on April
25 and complete its work within a month and a half, he said.

result, causing serious disturbance in the tiny southern African

<HEADLINE> International Meeting of Free Trade Union Opens in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The 17th conference of the
International Confederation of Free Trade Union (ICFTU) opened in
South Africa's port city of Durban on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony at Duban International
Convention Center, South African Deputy President Jacob Zuma said
"the conference takes place at a time when we are poised between
the old and the new and the people of the African continent are
keenly looking forward to the continued development of a more
humane and socially just society on the continent."
</P>
<P>
The world is "witnessing truly epochal shifts in the very
rubric of society", including the technological advances which are
"reshaping our universe in such profound ways," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the number of people living in absolute poverty has
increased, concomitantly with an increase in wealth of the
developed nations and the astronomical fortunes accumulated by
individuals, Zuma noted.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that globalization can not be left to manifest
itself through the globalizing of poverty, instead of the
spreading of wealth across the globe.
</P>
<P>
"This is a state of events that is potentially disastrous not
only for the poorer nations, but also for the rich nations. The
side by side existence of extreme poverty and immense wealth, in
the long term, in the 'global village' means that instability will
increase in society as the poor majority fight for better
conditions rather than succumb to continuous poverty," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that urgent action is required to end the conflicts
around the world and counter the effects of the spread of
HIV/AIDS, particularly on the African continent.
</P>
<P>
Zuma noted that another debilitating matter that continues to
impact negatively on the common development potential of the world
is the issue of debt relief.
</P>
<P>
"I wish to draw the attention of the trade unionists from the
developed world to the protectionist practices that continue to
exist in many of the developed countries, despite calls to open up
markets to the developing nations on favorable conditions," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Euro Zone Records 3.8 billion Euro Trade Deficit in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The 11-country euro zone
registered a trade deficit of 3.8 billion euros (some 3.65 billion
U.S. dollars) with the rest of the world in January this year, up
280 percent over a year ago, the European Union's statistical
office, Eurostat, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the initial estimate of the EU's external trade for
January 2000 was a deficit of 12.3 billion euros (some 11.8
billion dollars). In January 1999, the 15-nation bloc recorded an
external trade deficit of 6.8 billion euros (about 7.9 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The deterioration of trade balances in both the euro zone and
the EU as a whole is explained by imports growing faster than
exports in 1999, with import rising by 9 percent and export by 3
percent.
</P>
<P>
The estimates for January indicate that the renewed growth in
exports that began in June last year is continuing.
</P>
<P>
According to the Eurostat, the European Union's exports were
weak in all main product groupings except "Chemicals" and "Energy,
" while for imports there was growth in all groupings except "Food
and drinks and "Crude materials."
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> British Columbia Orders End of Strike by School Staff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The legislature of Canada's
province of British Columbia passed a bill late Sunday to force 12,
000 school employees, who have been on strike for one week, back
to work.
</P>
<P>
The strike has left 370,000 students from spring break still
out of public schools, media reports here said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"It was important in the public interest that we act and we've
acted and children will be back in school," Premier Ujjal Dosanjh
of the province was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The premier called a rare Sunday sitting of the legislature
after the Public School Employers' Association failed to reach an
agreement with the Canadian Union of Public Employees on pay
equity, long-term disability and job security.
</P>
<P>
While ordering an end of the strike, the legislation also
called for the continued efforts to negotiate a resolution of
hundreds of convoluted issues.
</P>
<P>
Provincial Labor Minister Joy MacPhail was to appoint an
industrial inquiry commissioner to help the two sides reach a deal
in two months.
</P>
<P>
If there is no agreement by then, the commissioner will
recommend binding arbitration within 15 days, according to the
reports.

<HEADLINE> SKorea Begins Nationwide Fight Against Vesicular Disease  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean government Monday
decided to stage an anti-vesicular disease campaign across the
country to prevent the spread of vesicular disease.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at an emergency meeting of mayors and
governors chaired by Prime Minister Park Tae-joon, who was
instructed by President Kim Dae-jung to lead the campaign to
prevent the epidemic, which has killed hundreds of livestock in
the country since late last month.
</P>
<P>
The government directed all public servants, workers and
farmers in the livestock breeding industry to join in the campaign
to head off the spread of the foot-and-mouth disease, which was
first discovered in Paju, Kyonggi Province last week and later in
Hongsong, South Chungchong Province, Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government has ordered vaccines from Britain for
2 million heads of livestock, and will begin to provide preventive
shots to 11 million heads of cattle and pigs in the western part
of the nation.
</P>
<P>
Western areas are under intensive quarantine process as other
areas such as Yonki, South Chungchong Province, and Hwasong,
Kyonggi Province, saw similar cases that turned out to be negative
in the tests.
</P>
<P>
Japan and China's Taiwan have suspended import of livestock and
meat from South Korea while the United States and Australia halted
import of dairy products from the country.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean Quarantine Department has confirmed the
epidemic is O-type epidemic on livestock's mouth and hoof which
swept Taiwan one year ago.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that the epidemic has been found on the
Korean Peninsula since 1934.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Acting PM Plays Key Role in Tripartite Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary
Mikio Aoki, who was appointed acting prime minister Monday
following Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's sudden hospitalization, is
known for his close ties with the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)'s
two coalition partners, the Liberal Party (LP) and the New Komeito
party.
</P>
<P>
Aoki, 65, is a key member of Obuchi's faction in the (LDP),
which launched a tripartite coalition government with the LP and
the New Komeito, an alliance that lasted only six months.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi announced Saturday that his LDP and the New Komeito are
ending their partnership with the LP, the smallest of the three
coalition partners, after he and the leaders of the other two
parties failed to share basic ideas on how to operate the
coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Aoki, who concurrently heads the Okinawa Development Agency, is
an old friend of LP leader Ichiro Ozawa and had been expected to
play a key role in propelling the tripartite coalition under
Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
Aoki, who succeeded Hiromu Nonaka as chief cabinet secretary
and top government spokesman last October, is serving his third
consecutive term in the House of Councilors, or the upper house.
</P>
<P>
He is a close aide to former Japanese Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita. After helping Takeshita's election campaigns while
still a student at Waseda University, Aoki became secretary to him.
</P>
<P>
After serving in his native Shimane Prefecture as a prefectural
assembly member for five terms, Aoki advanced into Japan's
national politics by being elected to the upper house in 1986.
</P>
<P>
Following the 1998 upper house election, Aoki became secretary
general of the LDP delegation in the upper chamber.
</P>
<P>
By winning cooperation from the New Komeito in passing a number
of key bills at the last regular Diet (parliament) session which
ended in August 1999, Aoki further boosted his reputation.
</P>
<P>
Aoki said Monday he decided to accept the post of acting prime
minister based on the assessment that Obuchi would not be able to
return to work briefly.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi, 62, was hospitalized early Sunday after suffering a
stroke and is being treated in an intensive care unit at a Tokyo
hospital.

<HEADLINE> FIA International Court of Appeal to Hear McLaren Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The International Automobile
Federation opened its International Court of Appeal here on Monday
to hear McLaren's protest over the disqualification of its driver
David Coulthard in an earlier Formula One race.
</P>
<P>
In the March 26 Brazilian Formula One Grand Prix, Coulthard
placed second behind Ferrari's Michael Schumacher but was
disqualified when stewards ruled the front wing of his car was two
millimeters out of tolerance.
</P>
<P>
McLaren argued that the "very bumpy" track contributed to the
car being out of regulation. He added that the car was clearly in
regulation at the beginning of the race.
</P>
<P>
FIA spokesman Francesco Longanesi said the panel would announce
its decision Tuesday. If the appeal fails, F1's top team the last
two seasons will be without a point in either the drivers' or
constructors' standings after two races.
</P>
<P>
The court of appeals consists of FIA Chairman Philippe Roberti
de Winghe and judges from the Netherlands, Portugal, Ireland and
Spain.
</P>
<P>
Five months ago, an FIA appeal panel seemed to bend the rules
by reinstating Ferrari's 1-2 finish in the Malaysian Grand Prix
after stewards ruled aerodynamic deflectors were out of compliance
by one centimeter. That took the meet victory and the season
title from McLaren's Mika Hakkinen and forced the title to be
decided at the season-ending Japanese Grand Prix. Hakkinen won in
Japan and claimed the drivers' championship.

<HEADLINE> Asia's Stone Age Started Earlier Than Previously Thought: Experts ( 1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Asia's Stone Age started as early
as 800,000 years ago, putting it at a similar level to those in
Africa and Europe, experts with a Sino-American archeological team
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was based on the Sino-American joint
excavation launched in 1993 in the Baise Basin, in south China's
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, which neighbors Vietnam. Large
numbers of stone tools including two-sided stone hand axes were
unearthed during the excavation.
</P>
<P>
"The Baise project has been the earliest, the largest and the
most reliably dated Stone-Age excavation so far found in East Asia,
" said Richard Potts, an archeologist from the Human Origins
Program of the Smithsonian Institute in Washington DC.
</P>
<P>
The previously most reliably dated stone tools in East Asia
were no more than 500,000 years old.
</P>
<P>
"The tools provide compelling evidence to refute a concept
originated by Harvard University anthropologist Hallam Movius in
1948," said Potts.
</P>
<P>
Movius is generally respected as one of the most influential
theorists on paleoanthropology. In one of his most famous theories,
he divided the peoples of the Early Stone Age into two groups:
those who could make sophisticated, two-sided stone hand axes and
those who could not.
</P>
<P>
According to his early research, he wrote off the entire Asian
continent to the second class, saying that Asians were less adept
compared with people in Africa and Europe.
</P>
<P>
However, thousands of stone tools dating back some 800,000
years ago have been unearthed in the 800-sq-km basin, which is a
hilly rural area covered with red dirt. Most of the stone tools
were so systematically manufactured that experts believe some 50
working procedures must have been taken to polish each one of them.

<P>
The hand axes were symmetrically forged, and all are of a
similar size, which reflect the fairly high level craftsmanship of
the time, said Potts.
</P>
<P>
Huang Weiwen, an archeologist with the China Institute of
Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology under the Chinese
Academy of Sciences, told Xinhua that the toolmakers were as
skillful as their counterparts in Africa.
</P>
<P>
"Asians and Africans living in the early period of the Stone
Age shared the same level of technology," Huang said.
</P>
<P>
Some of the stone relics were collected as early as 1973.
However, archeologists had found it hard to date some of them.
</P>
<P>
It was not until recently that Alan Deino, a geologist with the
Berkeley Geochronology Center in California, used radiometric
decay of argon isotopes to pinpoint the age of tektite, which is a
glassy remnant of molten rocks, in the tools.
</P>
<P>
Geologists here have suggested that a large meteorite struck
the South China region about 800,000 years ago. The impact sent up
a spray of molten debris and ignited fires that cleared a thick
cover of trees and exposed red earth as well as the underlying
beds of large conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
After the catastrophe, early humans had plenty of stones for
making tools. The tektite resulted from the meteorite impact.

<HEADLINE> China Bans Direct Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government issued a
circular today banning direct sales, which are staging a comeback
in the country.
</P>
<P>
The State Administration for Industry And Commerce asked local
law enforcers to crack down on various forms of direct sales,
including the "Network Double Earn", "Allied Chain", "Motivating
Sale" and "Rolling Sale".
</P>
<P>
The circular says that the operation will especially target
profiteers who prey on gullible people.
</P>
<P>
Units or persons who shift responsibility or dare to confront
the government will be punished, the circular warns.
</P>
<P>
Direct sales were introduced into China in the early 1990s by
some foreign companies, and soon became popular among people who
wanted to get rich overnight.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government eyes direct sales as illegal business
operations because they have created chaos in the market and
cheated people.

<HEADLINE> China's Poverty Line System to Cover All Urban Poor (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to the official, local governments have set their own
poverty lines in accordance with local economic development and
financial capabilities, ranging from 319 yuan a month in Shenzhen,
a boomtown in south China's Guangdong Province, to 143 yuan in
Yinchuan, capital of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region in the
northwest.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the central and local governments paid a total of 1.
969 billion yuan in subsistence allowances, including a central
government subsidy of 400 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Li pointed out that there are two major problems concerning the
implementation of the new system. "One is that some poor residents
feel ashamed of applying for the allowances and some others just
don't know exactly how to apply," he said, noting that the other
problem is that in old industrial bases where state-owned
enterprises are concentrated and other less-developed inland areas,
due to financial strain, a large number of urban residents fail to
be covered by the system.
</P>
<P>
He pledged more publicity work to let the public know about the
relevant policies in order to increase the coverage of the poverty
line policy.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Civil Affairs is planning inspections of local
governments to ensure the performance of their legal duties to the
poor, Li said.
</P>

The ministry is also working with the Ministry of Finance on
ways to channel revenues to less-developed areas to help the urban

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The central authorities will take
measures to ensure local governments across China to perform their
duties in accordance with the law to implement the urban
subsistence security system, an official with the Ministry of
Civil Affairs said here today.
</P>
<P>
"No urban poor people should be left out of the last 'safety
net' of our social relief system," said Li Bengong, director of
the Disaster Mitigation and Relief Department under the Ministry
of Civil Affairs, at a press conference held by the State Council
Information Office.
</P>
<P>
The urban subsistence security system, introduced in China in
1994, is a social relief system under which the government grants
allowances to people living under the poverty line, and is a major
breakaway from the country's traditional social relief networks.
</P>
<P>
The new system is of special significance for the large numbers
of workers laid off by loss-making state-owned enterprises, Li
said.
</P>
<P>
By September 1999, all of China's 669 cities and 1,638 towns
where county-level governments are situated had set up the urban
subsistence system, fulfilling the task set by the State Council
three months ahead of schedule, and a total of 2.87 million urban
residents across the country received allowances, the official
noted.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the regulations on subsistence security for
urban citizens issued by the State Council went into effect as of
October 1 last year.

<HEADLINE> China to Step Up Development of Resources in West </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- China intends to explore for
petroleum, natural gas, coal, rare metals and other mineral
resources in ten key areas in its western regions.
</P>
<P>
Exploration for minerals which are urgently needed and have a
significant bearing on the national economy will be accelerated in
the Tarim, Qaidam and Altay regions, on the upper reaches of the
Jinsha River, and on the middle and lower reaches of the Lancang
River, said Minister of Land and Resources Tian Fengshan.
</P>
<P>
Tian told Xinhua that in addition to mineral resources, China
will strengthen investigations into land and water resources in
the west to promote the development of the region, and to relieve
water shortages there.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized the importance of harmonious development between
resources utilization and environmental protection, and said the
ministry will make overall planning for exploiting mineral and
land resources in the western region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he suggested the establishment of a geological
disaster forecasting system in the Three Gorges area.
</P>
<P>
There are about 39.3 million hectares of waste land suitable
for cultivation in the west, or more than half of the total
potential arable land in China. Among the 155 minerals found in
China, 123 can be found in the west, and over 20 mineral resources,
including natural gas, are abundant in the region.

<HEADLINE> Iran Seeks Oil Output Hike Without Harming Market: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar
Zanganeh said here on Monday that Iran seeks an oil output hike to
preserve its share in the world oil market but will not go for a
production rise which may ruin the market.
</P>
<P>
Iran is seeking a rise in oil production given the market
realities, Zanganeh stressed, adding its policy of not flooding the
market with additional oil does not mean that Iran will not
increase its production.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister did not disclose how many barrels Iran
would add to its current output of about 3.3 million barrels per
day, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
There should be timely supplies of crude oil to meet market
demand, he said, but there is no shortage of oil in the world oil
market in the first quarter of the current year. Therefore, oil
should not suddenly enter the market, he added.
</P>
<P>
Despite Iran and Iraq opposition, nine of the 11 members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) agreed in
Vienna at Tuesday to boost oil production by 6.3 percent, or a
total of 1.45 million barrels a day from April 1.
</P>
<P>
Iran initially did not sign the agreement, insisting that it was
a bow to U.S. pressure to bring down oil prices which almost
tripled since oil producers enforced an output curb in March 1999.
</P>
<P>
However, Iran announced one day later that it would increase oil
production for fear of losing market share. Under Tuesday's
agreement, Iran should raise its oil production by 264,000 barrels
a day, thus enabling the cartel to boost total output by 7.5
percent over the ceiling set when it cut production last year.
</P>
<P>
Iran wants OPEC members to safeguard their long-term interests
and the survival of the cartel depends on the spirit of cooperation
and interaction among its members, the minister said.

<HEADLINE> Libyan Leader Meets EU Commission President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi met
here with European Union Commission President Romano Prodi Monday
on the fringe of the upcoming Africa-Europe summit that will open
later in the day.
</P>
<P>
The Gaddafi-Prodi talks, taking place by Gaddafi's spacious tent
erected in the presidential palace, is the Libyan leader's first
such meeting since U.N. sanctions on Libya were suspended last year
after the Northern Africa state surrended the two suspects in a
1988 bombing of an American flight.
</P>
<P>
No details of the meeting are available now. But Irish Prime
Minister Bertie Ahern, who emerged from the palace after his own
talks with Gaddafi, said the Libyan leader's talks with Prodi were
significant.
</P>
<P>
A Belgian delegate to the summit has said earlier that Prodi and
Gaddafi would be likely to discuss Libya's possible participation
in the Barcelona process, a political and economic dialog begun in
1995 between the EU and countries of the Mediterranean rim.
</P>
<P>
The leaders came to Cairo for the first Africa-Europe summit,
which will be held on Monday and Tuesday, involving heads of state
or government, or their representatives from most of the 53 African
states and all the 15 EU members.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day conference, the leaders will address
political, economic, development issues in the poor Africa
continent.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Plummet On Singapore Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Share prices took a hammering on
Singapore Stock Market Monday as sentiment of caution was
prevailing over the market on lack of no positive news.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Index dropped 60.91 points, or 2.86
percent, to close at 2,071.68 points, falling through the 2,100-
point psychological support level.
</P>
<P>
The market volume totaled 268.92 million shares worth 615.31
million Singapore dollars (358.78 million U.S. dollars). Declining
issues overwhelmed advancers nearly 10 times at 301 to 35 with 187
counters unchanged.
</P>
<P>
MAE Engg topped the volume list as it registered a turnover of
35.73 million units. It was followed by SingTel which had 14.78
million shares transacted. NOL was the next with 10.33 million
counters changing hands.
</P>
<P>
Parkway led ascent of the day edging up 16 cents to close at 5
Singapore dollars. First Eng moved up 12 cents to finish at 1.07
Singapore dollars. Natelect inched up 10 cents to end at 11.3
Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
PacCent was the biggest loser of the day plummeting by 310
cents to close at 20.00 Singapore dollars. SPH 100 incurred a loss
of 190 cents to finish at 26.00 Singapore dollars. Creative 50
gave up 180 cents to end at 52.50 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
Brokers attributed Monday's drop to lack of positive factors to
spurn the market following the continual fall on the NASDAQ last
week.
</P>
<P>
They singled out the SingTel which fell by five percent to 2.32
Singapore dollars on a sell-off following Singapore's full
liberalization of its telecommunication market starting on April 1,
2000.
</P>
<P>
Analysts noted that Singapore Stock Market's capitalization has
sank by almost 20 percent from its January 3 peak as investors
ignored heavyweights and blue chips in favor of relatively
lightweight technology plays.
</P>
<P>
They said the market sentiment was heavily dampened by the
sharp fall on the NASDAQ whose electronic index plunged by 390
points or 7.87 percent last week.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Lawyers to Find Way Out of Sharia Controversy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian lawyers Sunday decided to
send a panel to dialog with the country's Zamfara State government
over its controversial way of implementing the Islamic legal
system Sharia.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper, on Monday reported
that the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) described at one of its
meeting in Lagos on Sunday the amputation of Baba Zangedi by
Zamfara State government last week as "inhuman".
</P>
<P>
"We have agreed that NBA should pay a private visit to Zamfara
State to meet the Attorney-General of the state, the Chief
Executive, Governor Ahmed Sani, Chief Judge and possibly members
of the House of Assembly with a view to seeing how those issues
can be amicably and democratically resolved," said NBA spokesman,
George Igbokwe.
</P>
<P>
"On Sharia issue, we took a decision condemning the amputation
of somebody's hand in execution of a court judgment," he said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the widespread condemnation, Governor Ahmed Sani of
Zamfara State, who took the lead in the west African country in
January this year to introduce Sharia, had vowed to amputate more
in order to implement Sharia to full extent.
</P>
<P>
He declared last week that any civil servant who stole more
than 4,000 naira (about 40 U.S. dollars) public fund would
henceforth have his right hand amputated.
</P>
<P>
After the bloody conflicts over Sharia in Kaduna and other
States, President Olusegun Obasanjo had expressed hopes in
different occasion that such private organizations like the NBC
should play roles in finding a way out of the issue, which the
government was not in a good position to intervene.

<HEADLINE> More Than 20 Somalis Killed by Cholera </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Cholera is being reported in
several villages in the famine and drought stricken region of Bay,
Somalia, with the worst hit being Bulo Fullay Village, where more
than 20 people have died of the disease since Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
According to Osman Sidi, one of the local elders in the nearby
Bur Hakaba District, health officials from the World Health
Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)
visited the village two days ago to take samples from the stools
of the patients falling for the serious diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
The samples were then taken to laboratories in Kenya's capital
Nairobi for verification and they have all been tested positive
for cholera.
</P>
<P>
So far 106 people have been lying for the disease inside the
temporary quarantine facility in the village for treatment, said
heath workers interviewed.
</P>
<P>
The situation is getting out of the hand despite serious
efforts by the UNICEF accompanied by the technical support of the
WHO in relation to the crises, said Mohamed Hassan Dhimbil,
secretary for regional public affairs.
</P>
<P>
He said the situation is being aggravated by the scarcity of
water in the region as a result of the droughts which hit the area
after no rains were seen in the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
The sanitation is poor, the animals have been moved from the
area for pasture and water, adding to the grievance of the
situation, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the mal-nutrition has been at its highest since 1992.
</P>
<P>
In another development, three people died for cholera in the
nearby village of Dodaleh on Monday, with dozens more on the brink
of dying as there is no adequate anti-dehydration solution for
them to take.
</P>
<P>
Despite these difficulties, the International Committee for the
Red Cross (ICRC) has been distributing food to the famine stricken
families in Bay, Bakol and Gedo regions where the drought has been
at its worst. More than 700 tons of food has been distributed.
</P>
<P>
Ali Osman Barirreh, one of the elders in the famine stricken
region of Gedo, said the distribution of beans, maize and cooking
oil has been well under way on Monday for the sixth day.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that despite the food delivery, the situation
is far from being stable because dozens of families are still
stranded in the countryside after leaving their villages and towns
for lack of water.

<HEADLINE> New Party Formed in Japan to Stay Within Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Former Japanese Home Affairs
Minister Takeshi Noda and 25 other lawmakers Monday split from the
Liberal Party (LP) and formed a new party, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to continue to take responsibility as members of
the coalition government," Noda was quoted as saying at a meeting
in announcing the launch of the new party.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the 50 Diet (parliament) members of the LP
joined the meeting, according to Kyodo.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, LP leader Ichiro Ozawa did not express any clear
decision on pulling his party out of the coalition at a party
meeting Monday, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Ozawa was widely expected to announce his party's withdrawal
from the coalition in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi announced last Saturday
that his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the New Komeito party
will end their alliance with the LP.
</P>
<P>
"We failed to share basic ideas over how to operate the
coalition government," Obuchi told reporters after meeting with
Ozawa and New Komeito leader Takenori Kanzaki Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
The LP formed a two-way coalition with the LDP in January 1999,
which was joined by the New Komeito in October of that year.
</P>
<P>
In the 15 months the LP was in the coalition, Ozawa had
threatened to pull his party out on several occasions.

<HEADLINE> Those Responsible for Major Guangdong Fire Dealt With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANTOU, April 3 (Xinhua)-- Three leading officials of
Longjiang Township of Huilai County in southern Guangdong Province,
where a major fire occurred last month, were removed from their
posts after being held responsible for the disaster.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made by the Party committee and government of
Jieyang City, which exercises administration over Huilai County.
</P>
<P>
The three local officials are Huang Xianliang, who acted as the
Party secretary of Longjiang Township, Wu Mubo, the township head,
and Tang Longqing, the deputy township head.
</P>
<P>
Also in line with the decision, the Party committee and
government of Huilai County should make a thorough review of the
fire and seek the responsibility of Li Qin, who is deputy head of
Huilai County and is in charge of safety in production.
</P>
<P>
Xie Xiguang, head of the Huilai Fire Brigade, was also
suspended from his duties and is awaiting further investigation.
A special police team was formed to track down Chen Linping, who
is director of the ill-fated Jiacheng Lighter Factory and is still
a fugitive.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, the accident occurred around 3:40
p.m. on the afternoon of March 28 and was caused by the leakage of
inflammable gas and an ensuing explosion, killing 17 people and
injuring six others. The fire was put out around 5:00 p.m.
</P>
<P>
The lighter factory is an overseas-funded firm that did not
have prior registration with the relevant local industrial and
commercial administrative departments, and it came to the town of
Longjiang in Huilai County from Humen in the nearby city of
Dongguan early this year. The unlicensed factory, which employs
more than 100 workers, mainly produces disposable plastic lighters.
</P>
<P>
After the accident, local government officials, along with a
fire brigade, public security officers, and medical workers,
rushed to the site promptly for rescue efforts.
</P>
<P>
While urging relevant departments to go all out to save the
injured and try their best to reduce the death toll, Guangdong
Provincial Party Secretary Li Changchun called for a serious
investigation of the disaster.

<HEADLINE> Energy Development in Western China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- China is shifting its energy
development focus from east to west as it undertakes massive
exploration and utilization of natural gas in the western region
of the country.
</P>
<P>
The west, including the provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Sichuan,
and Qinghai, the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region and Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region, is very rich in oil, gas, coal, and hydropower.
</P>
<P>
The central and local governments have issued preferential
policies for developing the energy industry in this region, and
energy there has maintained an annual increase rate of 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
Today, the energy sector accounts for about 50 percent of west
China's industrial output value, according to the China Energy
Research Society (CERS).
</P>
<P>
The CERS experts say that optimization of industrial structure
and increasing demand for energy and raw materials in the eastern
region of the country has stimulated energy development in the
west.
</P>
<P>
Through years of development, China has developed three large
natural gas production bases in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia region,
the Tarim Basin, and Sichuan Province.

<HEADLINE> Low Scientific Level Hinders Western Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- A senior official has said that
the present level of science and technology in the western part of
China could not provide proper support for a leap forward in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The official with the Ministry of Science and Technology said
that one major factor hindering development of the western region
is the low level of its scientific and technological development.
</P>
<P>
He said a joint research project launched by his ministry and
government departments concerned indicated that the scientific
infrastructure facilities in the western provinces and autonomous
regions are quite outdated. In addition, many scientists and
researchers are eager to find posts in the developed coastal areas,
as many western region research institutions do not have enough
funds and have not built up a market-oriented personnel system.
</P>
<P>
He said the western region does not have badly needed
agricultural technology and seed varieties for developing high-
quality and high-efficiency agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The joint research project also showed that skills of farmers
need to be greatly improved, and the building of agrotechnology
and personnel markets needs greater efforts in the region.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the lack of scientific and technological exchange
channels hinders the efforts of the western region to fully
utilize the scientific discoveries made by the coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
As to scientific research organs, he said, a major problem is
that most of them have not arranged any market-oriented research
programs. Moreover, most ventures in the western region have not
yet built up an innovation mechanism that can respond quickly to
market changes.
</P>
<P>
The pollution emitted by rural enterprises and the upgrading of
state-owned enterprises also require more efforts by scientists
and technicians.
</P>
<P>
He said scientific feasibility studies are also badly needed
for future large projects in the western region, as many projects
completed in the past have not brought the expected profits and
have even produced adverse side-effects as a result of a lack of
rational planning.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: China's Poverty Line System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The guarantee of a minimum
standard of living is the last social safety net in China's social
security system.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Civil Affairs of China has listed four
categories of urban poor as beneficiaries of the poverty line
system: those with no regular income, no ability to work and no
one to support; families with incomes below the minimum standard
of living; the unemployed no longer covered by unemployment
benefits policies; and others whose living standards are below the
poverty line.
</P>
<P>
China's old social security system, which was founded in the
1950s, has provided a small portion of the population with a
minimum standard of living.
</P>
<P>
China's 40-year-old social security system was patterned on
that of the former Soviet Union, with expenditures solely funded
by the state and state-owned enterprises regardless of the country
's financial health.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, Shanghai took the initiative by implementing the
system of a minimum standard of living, and the practice quickly
spread to the rest of China.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Guangdong Province extended the this safety net not
only to all cities, but also to its rural areas.
</P>
<P>
By September last year, all 668 cities and 1,638 towns where
county seats are located have been covered by the system of a
minimum standard of living, and more than 2.817 million city
residents were receiving subsidies.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Soldiers Armed With Intranet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- In a barracks of the Chinese
People's Liberation Army (PLA), Sergeant Yuan Hucheng is talking
with his young pals about what type of arms the Taiwan troops are
equipped with.
</P>
<P>
By clicking the mouse, Yuan pulls up pictures of aircraft,
tanks, and frigates of the army across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
"The 'army net bar' helps us learn about the armed forces of
other countries and regions in an easier way," Yuan says, "It was
unimaginable before."
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, Chinese soldiers and officers are becoming armed and
acquainted with a new weapon and friend -- the PLA Intranet.
</P>
<P>
PLA headquarters has been working hard building its internal
information network to give PLA troops access to on-line libraries,
lectures, mail, and even movies, as the General Political
Department of the PLA has opened a on-line cinema for the soldiers.
</P>
<P>
According to one officer, many PLA soldiers are now able to
cyber-surf download, and write with Chinese input, and some are
even becoming good at creating multi-media software, he says.
</P>
<P>
"With the computer network, grassroots soldiers and officers
are experiencing enormous changes in their way of thinking," says
Dong Gushun, a political commissar of a PLA division. "Along with
the popularization of the Intranet, the Chinese army has entered
into a new stage of development."

<HEADLINE> Economist Suggests New Ways for Developing West (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- A leading Chinese economist
suggested recently that western China must initiate new ways for
future development to suit the fundamental changes in the internal
and external economic situation.
</P>
<P>
The west should rely on markets instead of preferential
policies made by the central authorities, Chen Jiagui, vice-
president of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), said
in an essay in the latest issue of the China Industrial Economics
journal.
</P>
<P>
The western municipality of Chongqing, and all western
provinces and autonomous regions should actively cultivate their
own markets and encourage all sectors of the economy including the
state-owned, collective, and private, the well-known economist
said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, people in the west must change the former
extensive mode of economic development into an intensive one,
which will greatly save both natural and human resources.
</P>
<P>
Shifting the focus from traditional mineral exploitation, the
west should pursue coordinated development of all industries, with
emphasis placing on high-yield farming and farm produce processing,
electronics, information technologies, automation, space
technologies, and tourism-related services, Chen suggests.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Chen urges local governments to stimulate township
enterprises as this will provide many more job opportunities for
surplus workers in the west.
</P>
<P>
The expansion of small towns and the development of township
enterprises also should be combined, Chen said.

<HEADLINE> Economist Suggests New Ways for Developing West (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China's central authorities are planning an ambitious project
to enhance the economic strength of the western region to
harmonize the pace of development between the economically-
retarded west and the comparatively developed east.
</P>
<P>
With 56 percent of the country's land area and 23 percent of
its population, the west encompasses 10 provinces and autonomous
regions and Chongqing Municipality.
</P>
<P>
The west also has half of China's total mineral reserves.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that from 1949 to 1978, the average annual
growth of the west reached 7.25 percent in terms of gross national
product, slightly higher than that of the east.
</P>
<P>
However, after the 1980s, the Chinese government decided to
open the east and coastal areas to the rest of the world,
gradually widening the gap between east and west.
</P>
<P>
Adjacent to Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan, the east easily
attracts much more overseas investment and exports more goods.
</P>
<P>
Chen urged the west to earnestly analyze the new conditions
prevailing in domestic and foreign markets, and thereby project
their own development strategies.
</P>
<P>
The regional governments should underscore safeguarding the
environment and raising living standards, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to sources, the central government this year will
focus on infrastructure construction and environmental protection
in western China.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
Monday signed a partnership agreement with Bangladesh on poverty
reduction here.
</P>
<P>
The accord was signed by ADB President Tadao Chino and
Bangladesh Finance Minister Shah A. M. S. Kibria on behalf of
their respective sides.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will facilitate future ADB financing for poverty
reduction, which was declared as the overriding goal by the ADB
recently.
</P>
<P>
The ADB started signing poverty reduction partnership
agreements separately with its developing member countries, of
which Bangladesh became a model as it was the first to implement
the bank's strategy.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Bangladesh will strive to achieve
universal primary education by the year 2010 and reduce the
maternal mortality rate by 75 percent and the infant mortality
rate by 65 percent.It will also aim to cut the proportion of
malnourished children under five by 40 percent and make
reproductive health services available to all women of appropriate
age by 2010.
</P>
<P>
Chino said the ADB lending to Bangladesh will be about 500
million U.S. dollars annually from next year. The bank's annual
lending to the country at the moment is around 362 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
When meeting with Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, the
visiting ADB president praised the government's micro-credit
policy,particularly the poverty alleviation program.
</P>
<P>
Hasina welcomed the ADB chief and urged him to consider the
objective situation of a country while pushing for any reforms.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Import 400,000 Tons of Sugar in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan is likely to import 400,
000 tons of Sugar in 2000 to bridge the gap between production and
consumption, an official source disclosed here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The government has received final figures of 2.5 million tons
of sugar production from the country's sugar mills, against the
local consumption of 2.9 million tons, an official from the
Ministry of Food was quoted by the Associated Press of Pakistan as
saying.
</P>
<P>
To meet the shortfall, the country will have to import
approximately 400,000 tons of sugar through the private sector
this year, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Sugar producers in Pakistan have been urging the government to
increase sugar import tariff substantially so that imported sugar
does not price out the indigenous product.
</P>
<P>
Sugar price is currently some 9 rupees (17 U.S.cents) per
kilograms in the international markets, much lower than that in
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The South Asian country has produced 46 million tons of
sugarcane in 1999-2000, compared with 55 million tons a year ago,
official statistics show.

<HEADLINE> Singapore to Review Banking Liberalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Singapore will review the
progress of the banking liberalization program next year and
decide on further steps to open up the sector.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said this at a closed-
door seminar organized by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)
, the central bank, here.
</P>
<P>
Local banks will come under increasing pressure, not from MAS,
but from the rapid changes in technology and the market, he said.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister, also chairman of MAS, unveiled last
May sweeping liberalization measures to increase foreign banks'
exposure to Singapore's domestic banking sector.
</P>
<P>
These include lifting a 40-percent limit on foreign ownership
in local banks and allowing more foreign banks into local retail
banking as well as wholesale banking.
</P>
<P>
Lee said the first priority for local banks is to upgrade their
capabilities and strengthen their management teams.
</P>
<P>
"This is the only way for them to hold their own in the new
environment, either by themselves or linked up with others in a
strategic alliance or merger," he said.
</P>
<P>
Banks also need to prepare themselves for new business
opportunities, especially e-banking, according to Lee.
</P>
<P>
MAS will continue discussing with local banks ways to increase
bank transparency further as greater disclosure will reinforce
corporate governance.
</P>
<P>
MAS is also reviewing the current minimum liquid assets and
minimum cash balance requirements imposed on banks and the capital
requirements for financial holding companies and banking groups.
</P>
<P>
It is also looking at bank involvement in non-financial
activities and the cross-holding structures typical of Singapore
banking groups,Lee said.
</P>
<P>
The aim is to minimize the risk of contagion and ensure that
management is focused on the core business of banking, he said.

LAGOS, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Despite a dispute between Nigeria
and Cameroon over the ownership of the oil-rich Bakassi Peninsula
on their border, Nigeria's Cross River State has reportedly
concluded a trade agreement to throw its border open to Cameroon.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper, reported on Monday
that the Cross River State and Cameroon had agreed at a meeting
over the weekend at Bodam, a boundary town in the Francophone
nation, to construct link roads between their border towns to
facilitate trade relations and movement.

A spokesman of the state, which has land and sea borders with
Cameroon, was quoted as saying that the inter and intra-boundary
linkages would create markets and development for both countries.
</P>
<P>
Some border roads listed for construction in the budget had
been approved by the state's House of Assembly, he said.
</P>
<P>
Cameroon and Nigeria have fought several wars for the ownership
of Bakassi. The two countries are currently involved in a
prolonged legal battle at the International Tribunal of Hague over

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Plans Another Military Purge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government is planning
to down- size its armed forces in an effort to professionalize
them, according to a report reaching here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Defence Minister Theophilus Danjuma said at the weekend that
the government is poised to carry out the reorganization of the
armed forces to meet the yearnings and aspirations of Nigerians.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a dinner in honor of visiting United States Defense
 Secretary William Cohen in the capital Abuja, Danjuma said the
forthcoming down-size exercise of the armed forces is imperative
if democracy must succeed in the country.
</P>
<P>
Danjuma expressed the government's appreciation to the U.S.
government for its promise of 10 million U.S. dollars for various
training programs of Nigerian military aimed at making the forces
truly professional.
</P>
<P>
The proposed purge of the armed forces would be the third since
the inauguration of the present government last May. The first
such exercise affected mainly officers who were holding political
positions, while the second move involved those who held forte as
personal assistants or military assistants to their colleagues.
</P>
<P>
Cohen, the first ever U.S. defense secretary to visit Nigeria,
said the U.S. government is committed to assisting the western
African country in its efforts to revamp its economy and
professionalize its armed forces, adding that "though Nigeria is
going through a very difficult time, at the end of the tunnel,
there would be light."

<HEADLINE> Power Shortage Threatens Ethiopian Economy: Article </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian economy is facing a
big challenge from ever-increasing shortage of power, a signed
article published by the latest issue of Capital Weekly has
warned.
</P>
<P>
The overall situation of the energy sector is not encouraging
and leaves much to be desired, the article said.
</P>
<P>
Power consumers, including citizens of Addis Ababa, currently
face alternate power disruption from 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. (local
time) cycling every four days.
</P>
<P>
The demand for power supply to be consumed for the next four
months would amount to 203,000 kilowatts, while the current
generating capacity of the stations is only 180,000 kilowatts, the
Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation said in mid-march.
</P>
<P>
According to the article, Ethiopia's potential in electric
energy is estimated to be around 60 billion kilowatts, but it is
only one percent of this potential that has been utilized.
</P>
<P>
Currently, only four percent of the 62 million population in
the country has an access to electricity. Even in the capital, the
rate of penetration is no more than 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
The per capita electricity utilization in Ethiopia is around 22
kilowatt- hours, a figure by far below the world average,
including the average of developing nations, the article noted.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the reasons for the power shortage, the article
said, in addition to being short of investment for the power
industry, the drought disaster across the country has apparently
prompted the current power crisis because hydro-power stations in
the country cannot work properly at a dry season which has lasted
for about half a year since last October.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Sturgeons Released into Yangtze River Found in East China Sea (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The Fishery Bureau under China's
Ministry of Agriculture confirmed today that the "strange fish"
caught by a fisherman last month in the East China Sea was one of
the young Chinese sturgeons released into the Yangtze River last
year.
</P>
<P>
An bureau official said this indicates that some of the young
sturgeons released in Yichang in central China's Hubei Province on
December 28, last year, have successfully reached the sea after
swimming more than 2,000 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, a fisherman named Chen Fushun in
Zhejiang Province caught a live "strange fish" on March 17 which
had a metal plate on its back inscribed with the name of the
Yangtze River Aquatic Resources Institute and a telephone number.
</P>
<P>
When Chen got ashore the next afternoon, he phoned the
institute, which is in the city of Jingzhou in Hubei Province.
However, the two sides failed to understand each other because of
the great difference in their dialects.
</P>
<P>
Chen then took the fish to a market for sale only to be nabbed
up by the local police, who then sent the fish to a fish-breeder's
pond, but the fish died after 24 hours. Later, experts checked and
verified that the fish was one of the 100,000 young Chinese
sturgeons released into the Yangtze River at the end of last year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Sturgeons Released into Yangtze River Found in East China Sea (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Liu Zheng, head of the Wild Life Protection Division of the
Fishery Bureau, said that finding the sturgeon in the sea proves
that releasing artificially bred Chinese sturgeons into the
Yangtze River is an effective way to prevent the extinction of the
rare fish.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese sturgeon is known as a living fossil since it is
one of the oldest vertebrates in the world. The rare fish migrates
to the Jinshajiang River, a tributary of the Yangtze, from the sea
and spawns there, and when the minnows grow to about 10 cm, they
migrate back to the sea some 3,000 km away. As adults, they
migrate back upstream to their birthplace.
</P>
<P>
But the fish now faces worsening living conditions,
environmental pollution, and illegal and rampant fishing.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the number of Chinese sturgeons that swim back
to the Yangtze River every year has dropped to less than 1,000,
with only some 500 of them able to spawn. They warned that the
fish may become extinct in 50 years if effective measures are not
taken immediately.
</P>
<P>
To save the endangered species, China has set up two large
bases in Hubei to breed the fish, including the Yangtze River
Aquatic Resources Institute, and from 1983 to 1998, nearly six
million Chinese sturgeon minnows were released into the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
However, the minnows' survival rate is very low, as they are
mostly less than 10 cm in length and usually fall prey to other
species of fish in the river. To increased the survival rate, 100,
000 young Chinese sturgeons measuring over 10 cm were released
into the Yangtze last year.

<HEADLINE> Quality of China's Vegetable Seeds Needs Improvement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- China has world's largest area of
vegetable cultivation, growing most vegetable varieties. However,
the qualified rate of the vegetable seeds is only 57.8 percent,
according to a recent selective examination.
</P>
<P>
The spot check, conducted by the State Bureau of Quality and
Technical Supervision (SBQTS) among 45 kinds of Chinese cabbage
and kale seeds from 33 seed companies across China, showed that
only 26 kinds were up to standard.
</P>
<P>
The qualified rate of Chinese cabbage reached 68.9 percent, and
the ratio for kale was only 37.5 percent. Seeds of state-owned
enterprises were found to be of higher quality than those of
private companies, the examination revealed. The major quality
problems include germination and low purity.
</P>
<P>
China has a vegetable cultivation area of about 6.9 million
hectares, and vegetables are a major part of the Chinese diet.
Incomplete statistics show that the country has several thousand
seed companies, and over 60 percent deal in vegetable seeds.
</P>
<P>
SBQTS officials said that after China's entry into the World
Trade Organization, Chinese seed enterprises will face much
stiffer competition, and must increase the quality of their seeds.
</P>
<P>
The bureau and Chinese agricultural departments will to
penalize enterprises which fail to meet state standards.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Seen Leading Regional Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Citibank and Salomon Smith
Barney sees Malaysia as having a very prominent place in the
forefront of regional acceleration recovery, helped by a
supportive international environment.
</P>
<P>
The Citigroup estimates Malaysia's GDP growth at around 6
percent this year and 7 percent next year, up from 5.4 percent in
1999, Citibank and Salomon Smith Barney Director David Simmonds
said Monday at a press briefing on "Market Opportunities Around
Asia Recovery."
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's recovery would be led by increased domestic demand,
particularly private consumption, and not by the net export sector,
with growth in domestic demand forecast at 12.8 percent this year
and 13 percent next year, said Simmonds, who is also an Asia
currency strategist.
</P>
<P>
Private consumption in Malaysia was forecast to grow by 6.8
percent this year and 7 percent next year, compared with 2.5
percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
He said the international environment is quite positive and
supportive of further acceleration in regional and Malaysia's
growth this year.
</P>
<P>
The Citigroup forecast the inflation rate in Malaysia, which
was 2.8 percent in 1999, will rise to 3 percent this year and 3.5
percent next year.
</P>
<P>
It also forecast Malaysia's current account as a percentage of
gross domestic product (GDP) to decrease to 10.8 percent in 2000
and 5.8 percent in 2001 as against 13.9 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Given that there is no real significant issue in inflation and
no adverse development in international and regional markets, the
Asia currency strategist saw no immediate change in monetary
policy in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
He spoke positively of Malaysia's ringgit peg to the U.S.
dollar adopted in September 1998, saying the peg has been quite
helpful and provided an environment that benefits exporters who
are not challenged or excessively challenged from a competitive
point of view and exports could forge strongly ahead.
</P>
<P>
The peg allows the government to pursue policies that it feels
are positive, Simmonds said, adding that although capital controls
see Malaysia pursuing a different path to recovery from the others,
they have not taken Malaysia into a different alley where recovery
is concerned.

<HEADLINE> Former Indonesian President Questioned Over Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's Attorney General's
Office Monday questioned former President Soeharto over alleged
corruption,collusion and nepotistic practices during his 32-year
rule.
</P>
<P>
The questioning took place at his residence in Central Jakarta
but was suspended due to medical reasons.
</P>
<P>
The investigation team was chaired by Head of the Directorate
for Political Intelligence at the Attorney General's Office
Purnama Munthe with five members.
</P>
<P>
The team was joined by an independent medical team while
Soeharto, 78, was accompanied by his eldest daughter Siti
Hardiyanti Indrarukmana, lawyers and doctors.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after one and half hours of questioning,
Munthe said the investigation had not yet completed and therefore
no result could be announced. "We will announce such a result when
it (investigation) is completed."
</P>
<P>
He said the investigation was suspended due to medical reasons.
</P>
<P>
"Based on the doctors' advices, the examination was ceased
because(during the examination) Soeharto's blood tension arose. We
will continue our investigation if the doctors give us the green
light to do so," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Soeharto's lawyer Juan Felix Tampubolon said his
client was examined in connection with the foundations he chaired,
namely, the Foundation of Dakab, Supersemar and Dharmais.
</P>
<P>
He said the probe was suspended due to medical reasons.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Supardi, a member of the independent
medical team, said: "In the course of the examination, Soeharto
was exhausted and his blood tension went up. So we advised the
prosecutors to stop questioning. Because if it (questioning) was
continued it would endanger the health of Soeharto."
</P>
<P>
The questioning was carried out after Soeharto ignored a third
summons to appear at the Attorney General's Office Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Soeharto twice defied a legal summons to show up at
the Attorney General's Office for questioning about alleged
corruption in the charities he used to control, citing poor health.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto was named as a suspect in a case of alleged corruption
during his 32-year-rule after Attorney General Marzuki Darusman
decided to reopen the case in December last year.

SINGAPORE, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Deputy Prime Minister
Lee Hsien Loong struck a cautionary note Monday about investors'
recent mania in pursuing Internet-related stocks in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a closed-door seminar organized by the Monetary
Authority of Singapore (MAS), Lee advised investors to "shift more
toward an investment rather than a punting mentality."
</P>
<P>
He said few fully understand that they have to take
responsibility for their own investment decisions and accept the
risks along with the upside.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately this is only brought home when the market
crashes,or when problems surface," he said.
</P>
<P>
The dotcom mania in Singapore is much milder, Lee said, but
Singaporeans are also carried along by the general enthusiasm for
Internet-related stocks.
</P>
<P>
Although the Singapore government hopes to prevent the dotcom
enthusiasm from getting out of hand, he said, it can not go back
to merit regulation, namely, regulating by judging business merits.
</P>
<P>
"The surest form of investor education is to get burnt. But we
hope the lesson if it comes will not be too painful," he said.

<HEADLINE> China-funded Chrome Mine in South Africa Operating Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- A chrome mine and a ferro-chrome
smelter in South Africa funded by China Iron and Steel Industry
and Trade Group Corporation (CISITGC) is expected to produce 300,
000 tons of chrome ore and five tons of ferro-chrome this year.
</P>
<P>
Dong Zhixiong, vice-president of the CISITGC, told Xinhua that
his company and the Northern Province Development Corporation in
South Africa set up a joint venture -- ASA Metals (Pty.) Ltd.-- in
1996.
</P>
<P>
With an investment of 70 million U.S. dollars, the joint
venture is the largest funded by China in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture, with a term of 40 years, is designated to
develop a chrome mine which currently produces 400,000 tons of
chrome ore annually and can be mined for 100 years.
</P>
<P>
The venture also includes a ferro-chrome smelter with a
designed annual production capacity of 200,000 tons of charge-
grade ferro-chrome.
</P>
<P>
Since the joint venture went into operation in 1997, the chrome
mine has made profits for three consecutive years, ending its 20-
year history of loss making, according to Dong.
</P>
<P>
Dong said that the output of chrome ore has exceeded 900,000
tons, and sells well in China as well as in Europe, the United
States, and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The first phase project of the ferro-chrome smelter has
exported over 20,000 tons of ferro-chrome to Japan, the United
State, and the European markets since it became operational in
August last year. So far this year, 80 percent of its output has
been ordered.
</P>
<P>
Dong said the joint venture is a win-win project for both sides,
adding that it greatly eases the shortage of chrome ore in China,
and at the same time, the Northern Province in South Africa for
the first time has its own deep-processing enterprise which turns
out high value-added products, while providing employment for 500
local people.

<HEADLINE> Facts &AMP; Figures: Poverty Lines in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Facts &AMP; Figures: Poverty Lines in
China:
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1999, a total of 2.81 million urban residents
received subsistence security allowances across China.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the composition of the recipients, those who have
no ability to work, no source of income and no one to support them
account for one-quarter, while the employed, those laid-off from
state-owned enterprises, the unemployed and retired workers, and
others living in poverty, account for three-quarters.
</P>
<P>
Subsistence security standards, or poverty lines, are set by
local governments in accordance with their respective expenditure
levels on basic daily necessities, financial capabilities, and
other factors, and thus vary from place to place.
</P>
<P>
The poverty lines of 36 major cities in China (including
municipalities directly under the central government, provincial
capitals, and cities with separate budgets from the central
government) stand roughly as follows:
</P>
<P>
-- Shenzhen has the highest subsistence standard, 319 yuan (39
US dollars) a month, followed by Xiamen at 315 yuan, Guangzhou 281
yuan, Shanghai 280 yuan, Beijing 273 yuan, and Tianjin 241 yuan;
</P>
<P>
-- The cities of Dalian, Haikou, Hangzhou, Ningbo, Ji'nan, and
Qingdao also have a standard of over 200 yuan ( 24 US dollars) per
month.
</P>
<P>
-- The rest has the standards below 200 yuan, of which those
for Huhhot, Nanchang, and Yinchuan are the lowest at 143 yuan (17
US dollars).
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the regulations of the State Council, almost
all local governments have incorporated the funds for subsistence
allowances into their budgets. In 1999, a total of 1.969 billion
yuan was paid in subsistence allowances from the state and local
revenues, including a central government subsidy of 400 million
yuan.

<P>
NANJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Local police said today that the
slaughter of a German family in the early hours of Sunday in
Nanjing, the capital of east China's Jiangsu Province, is a simple
criminal case without any ambiguous background.
</P>

into their residence, called the No. 8 Villa House, Jinling
Imperial Garden, were stabbed to death fighting with the burglars,
the police said.
</P>
<P>
All four suspects were caught on the spot by the police, who
rushed to the scene upon receiving a report from guards at the
residential area. The four have confessed to the robbery and
killings.
</P>
<P>
The attack was random, and did not specially target foreigners,
according to police.
</P>
<P>
The German victims include 51-year-old Juergen Pfrang, deputy
general manager of Yaxing-Benz, a Sino-German automotive joint
venture in the city of Yangzhou in Jiangsu Province, and his wife,
son and daughter.

<HEADLINE> Thai, Pakistani Leaders Vow to Boost Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Pakistani leader General
Pervez Musharraf and Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai Monday
agreed to strengthen relations and boost cooperation between their
countries.
</P>
<P>
During Monday's meeting at the Government House, the two
leaders discussed broad issues covering bilateral ties and
relationship between Pakistan and the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN), according to Thai Government Spokesman
Akapol Sorasuchart.
</P>
<P>
Both leaders were pleased to see that the Pakistani-Thai
relations have kept growing during the last 50 years and they
vowed to explore new areas for bilateral cooperation, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are now planning to celebrate the 50th
anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf, who is on a five-nation Southeast Asia tour,
reiterated Pakistan's strong wishes to seek ASEAN support and
develop economic, trade and financial cooperation with ASEAN
countries.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN made Pakistan a "sectoral" dialogue partner in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Pakistani-Indian relations, Thai Prime
Minister Chuan appealed for the relaxation of tension in the South
Asian subcontinent.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his concern about the case of Pakistan's
former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and hoped Pakistan would handle
the case fairly.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf said he has left the case to the court and "
everything will be open and fair."
</P>
<P>
Thailand is the last stop of Musharraf's regional tour, which
began on March 26 and which has taken him to Malaysia, Singapore,
Indonesia and Brunei.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani leader arrived here Sunday and will return to his
country Monday evening.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Corporate Bond Market Expected to Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The corporate bond market in
Malaysia is expected to record a robust growth of 20 to 30 percent
in the next two years, a market observer said Monday.
</P>
<P>
For the market to grow, the interest rate should be low and
there should be the recognition of long-term capital needs and the
efficiency of bonds, David Zezza, Deutsche Bank managing director
for Asian Local Markets, said at a one-day conference here on the
development of the local debt market.
</P>
<P>
"There should be a shift in the allocation of capital in the
banking sector to the bond market while fixed income must serve as
a global asset allocation tool," he said while presenting a paper
at the conference jointly organized by the Hong-Kong based
magazine Financial Asia and Rating Agency Malaysia Bhd (RAM).
</P>
<P>
He also urged regulators to seek a high degree of foreign
participation in the bond market.
</P>
<P>
He said that besides the benefit of increased capital inflow,
local investors would benefit from the opportunity to diversify
credit exposure, without having to take on foreign exchange risk.
</P>
<P>
At the conference, Malaysia's Finance Ministry Advisor Mustapa
Mohamed announced in his keynote address that for developing the
domestic corporate bond market, the Malaysian government is taking
several measures, including amending the framework for the bond
market, implementing a share registration system and establishing
a centralized clearing and settlement system for all bonds.
</P>
<P>
All the measures are aimed at helping prevent excessive
concentration of credit risk in the banking system, increase
resistance to contagion and systemic problems in the corporate and
financial sectors, improve investment efficiency and promote
healthy competition, he said.

sent congratulatory telegrams to their Chinese counterparts Jiang
Zemin and Zhu Rongji respectively to mark the 50th anniversary of
the establishment of the bilateral relations.
</P>

"India and China are close neighbors. We greatly value the
spiritual and intellectual interaction between our two great
peoples and civilizations over the last two millennia, which has
enriched us both," said Narayanan in his message to President
Jiang on April 1.
</P>
<P>
"We have jointly bequeathed Panchsheel -- the Five Principles
of Peaceful Co-existence -- to the world, which at the dawn of the
new millennium has acquired new relevance in the conduct of inter-
State relations," the president added.
</P>
<P>
In his telegram to Chinese Premier Zhu on March 31, Vajpayee
said that "the twin imperatives of peace and prosperity impel us
to build on our historical affinity and expand our contacts and co-
operation."
</P>
<P>
With the joint efforts of the two sides, the two countries
could build a stable relationship of constructive cooperation into
the 21st century and contribute to peace and stability in Asia and
the whole world, Vajpayee added.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> HK Exhibition, Seminar Mark Basic Law Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 3 (Xinhua) -- An exhibition and seminar
marking the 10th anniversary of the promulgation of the Basic Law
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) opened here
today.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Jiang Enzhu, director of the Liaison Office of
the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong SAR, highly
praised people from all walks of life for their earnest effort in
carrying out the Basic Law over the past years.
</P>
<P>
Facts show that the Basic Law complies entirely with the
situation of Hong Kong and the interests of all the Chinese people
including the Hong Kong compatriots, and it is full of vitality,
said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Basic Law, which is cornerstone of the
political and legal systems of the Hong Kong SAR, offers legal
basis for the SAR administration and helps consolidate and further
develop the legal system of the region.
</P>
<P>
As the first law dedicated to the "one country, two systems,"
the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR has helped the smooth return of
Macao and will set an example for the ultimate reunification of
the motherland, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the young people are future backbone of the
community and it is important to acquainted them with the Basic
Law.
</P>
<P>
The active promotion of the Basic Law by the youth
organizations in Hong Kong has helped increase exchanges and
cooperation in the legal field between Hong Kong and the mainland
and has contributed much to the popularization of the Basic Law
among the young people, he said.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition and seminar was sponsored by the Hong Kong-based
Wen Wei Po newspaper and some youth organizations. Officials and
scholars from Hong Kong, Macao and the mainland delivered speeches
at the seminar.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Tourists to China Surge in First Two Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The latest statistics from the China National Tourism
Administration indicate that in January and February the number of
overseas tourists jumped 13.86 percent over the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, the number of strictly foreign tourists surged 24.
8 percent to 1.27 million, with tourists from Asia and Europe
growing by 28.8 percent and 21.9 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Among the 15 major target countries, tourists from Republic of
Korea shot up 51 percent, while the increase in the number of
tourists from the Philippines, Russia, and Indonesia exceeded 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
Tourists from Hong Kong and Taiwan still played a major role of
the country's international tourism market. In the first two
months, the number of tourists from Hong Kong grew 11.6 percent to
9.07 million, and the number from Taiwan rose by 19.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the two months, international tourism revenues increased 17.
5 percent over the corresponding period last year, with spending
by tourists staying at least one night in China brought in 2.02
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
A tourist official attributed the rise of international tourism
mainly to the surging number of tourists from Hong Kong and Taiwan
who returned to the mainland for the traditional Spring Festival,
and foreign tourists who wished to experience the festive period.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- European Union Middle East envoy Miguel Moratinos appealed
Sunday in Cairo for urgent international efforts to break the
deadlock in the Syrian-Israeli talks, saying the next month will be
crucial.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos said the 15-nation EU is in close contact with the U.
S., Israel and Syria to try to facilitate a resumption of talks,
following the failure of last Sunday's summit between U.S.
President Bill Clinton and Syrian President Hafez al-Assad in
Geneva.
</P>
<P>
"We believe a dialogue between the parties must be restored
within this month. We will use all our diplomatic and political
weight to try to convince the parties that the only way to solve
the issue is through diplomatic negotiations," Moratinos said.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- A 72-year old woman died in a Nahariya hospital after being
injured during Thursday's Land Day riots in Sakhnin. A relative of
the woman said her death resulted from the tear gas used by
security forces to disperse demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
The woman had joined a picnic to mark the 24th Land Day and had
taken part in the annual event since 1976. Violence erupted when a
group of youngsters discovered a police unit at a concealed
observation point in the woods and began stoning them.
</P>
<P>
An police spokesman said Sunday the family claim that the woman
died as a result of the Land Day riots was completely groundless
and that the elderly lady "died a natural death."
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy Sunday lashed out ay
Syrian President Assad: "He resembles the Egyptian Sphinx, whose
nose has been worn away by time and the winds, so it is difficult
to identify it. Perhaps Assad's nose has also lost the sense of
direction, but I hope good sense will ultimately guide him."
</P>
<P>
Speaking after meeting with visiting the Netherlands Prime
Minister Wim Kok, Levy also reiterated that Israel has taken a
decision to leave south Lebanon by July.
</P>
<P>
Levy said Israel's moves toward the withdrawal might induce
Syria, the major power broker in Lebanon, to expedite the peace
process, once Damascus understands that Israel is serious.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat will meet with
U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington late this month, Hassan
Abdel Rahman, the Palestinian Liberation Organization's Washington
representatives, told the Voice of Palestine radio Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said no official date has been set for the summit, but that
its is tentatively planned for April 26. "The main issue on the
agenda is where we are in the peace process," Abdel Rahman said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators will return to Washington on
Thursday for another 10-day round of negotiations over a final-
status framework agreement and the third phase further
redeployment.

<HEADLINE> Sarid's Security Further Heightened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Security around Education
Minister Yossi Sarid has been further tightened amid fears for the
the Meretz leader's safety.
</P>
<P>
Israel's internal security organization, the General Security
Service (GSS), has replaced Sarid's standard government-issued
Volvo with an armoured version and increased the number of guards
around him and his Tel Aviv home.
</P>
<P>
The decision to switch Sarid's car had been made just before
Shas spiritual leader Rabbi Ovadia Yosef made his infamous speech
two weeks ago, security sources said.
</P>
<P>
But they added that the Rabbi's rantings did contribute the
decision to further increase the protection around Sarid and his
family.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Rabbi Yosef compared Sarid to Haman and Amalek,
two historical enemies of the Jews, and called for his memory to be
stamped out.
</P>
<P>
One week later, Attorney-General Elyakim Rubinstein ordered a
police probe of Yosef, indicating Shas spiritual leader may have
violated the 1948 Prevention of Terrorism Law banning
pronouncements that encourage violence.
</P>
<P>
Shas said on Sunday that Yosef will not agree to be interrogated
by police and will instead present a detailed clarification letter
to the investigators.
</P>
<P>
The cloud of crisis continued to loom over the government
coalition till now as Sarid vehemently rejected a proposed
compromise put forth by Prime Minister Ehud Barak over duties to be
delegated to Shas Deputy Education Minister Meshulam Nahari.
</P>
<P>
Sarid informed Barak during their meeting on Sunday that he is
unwilling to reopen the issue of a recovery program for Shas's
educational network, which faces a financial shortage of millions
of U.S. dollars due to poor management.
</P>
<P>
The proposed compromise, worked out by the Minister in the Prime
Minister's Office Haim Ramon, suggests transferring the auspices
for the Shas educational network to a special committee chaired by
Nahari and the education ministry director-general. Any decision
pertaining to the network will have to be approved by the two, with
Sarid having the final say on any unresolved issues.
</P>
<P>
In addition, according to the proposal, a special ministerial
committee including Sarid, Ramon would be formed to identify
problems and disputes connected to the educational network and to
stop them from erupting into further coalition crisis.
</P>
<P>
Barak is scheduled to hold more meetings with Sarid and Shas
leaders in the coming days in order to defuse the coalition crisis.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Prosecutors Visit Soeharto at Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Attorney General's
Office Monday noon sent a team of prosecutors to visit former
President Soeharto at his residence in Central Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
A team of five doctors of the Cipto Mangunkusumo hospital also
arrived at noon to join the prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
The visit was made after Soeharto, 78, ignored a third summons
to appear at the Attorney General's Office Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Soeharto twice defied a legal summons to show up at
the Attorney General's Office for questioning about alleged
corruption in the charities he used to control, citing poor health.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto's lawyers said over the weekend that their client
could not meet the summons, insisting he was too ill to answer
questions despite an independent medical report that concluded he
was fit for questioning.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto was named as a suspect in a case of alleged corruption
during his 32-year-rule after Attorney General Marzuki Darusman
decided to reopen the case in December last year.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Strives to Develop Corporate Bond Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is making efforts to
develop the domestic corporate bond market, an alternative to debt
financing, to help prevent excessive concentration of credit risk
in the banking system.
</P>
<P>
Rationalizing the importance of having such a market, Mustapa
Mohamed, advisor to the Finance Ministry, said Monday that a well-
developed bond market would also increase resistance to contagion
and systemic problems in the corporate and financial sectors,
besides improving investment efficiency resulting from an increase
in market-based allocation of capital and the providing of an
early warning system.
</P>
<P>
Besides enabling a diversification of risks away from the
banking sector, a well-developed bond market will also provide
healthy competition, thereby reducing the cost of funds and
helping raise the quality of financial services to corporate
borrowers, he said at a conference on the development of the local
debt market here.
</P>
<P>
For this purpose, the government is finalizing amendments to
the Companies Act 1965, Securities Commission Act 1993 and the
Banking and Financial Institutions Act 1989 to effect the
government's decision on all approvals for debt issuance to be
centralized at the Securities Commission (SC), he said.
</P>
<P>
The amended framework for the corporate bond market, within
which corporate bond issuance is regulated, will come into effect
in the second half of this year, the advisor said.
</P>
<P>
He said the SC would also implement a share registration system
this year to allow issuers who meet certain criteria the
flexibility of raising multi-bond issues and timing them
accordingly to market conditions.
</P>
<P>
The advisor stressed the need to establish a centralized
clearing and settlement system for all bonds.
</P>
<P>
Bank Negara (State Bank) Malaysia has created the Bond
Information Dissemination System, from which listing and trading
information of all government and corporate bonds could be found,
he said, adding that the next step would be to develop it into a
centralized trading system and make it accessible to a bigger pool
of investors.
</P>
<P>
Mustapa also saw the necessity for the establishment of a bond
futures market as a subsequent step to expanding the bond market.

<HEADLINE> E. African States to Harmonize Investment Code </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Member states of the East African
Community (EAC) treaty are to have a uniform investment code by
December, 2001, the East African weekly reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania recently held a seminar on
harmonization of investment code in Kenya's capital Nairobi,
evolving an ambitious timetable under which the three are to
prepare and adopt the code.
</P>
<P>
The code, when working, is expected to harmonize and
rationalize incentives in the trading bloc, especially those
related to taxation of industries.
</P>
<P>
Last November, the three nations launched the EAC treaty in
Arusha, a northern town in Tanzania, which failed to address the
critical issues of trade barriers that affect investment.
</P>
<P>
With a view to producing a model investment code by December
2001, the region is expected to be developed into a single market
and investment area.
</P>
<P>
The investment code to be adopted is to include guidelines on
investment policies, and address such issues as establishment and
functions of investment promotion agencies, guarantee of foreign
exchange, stabilization of trade laws, settlement of disputes and
incentives, among others.

<HEADLINE> Sale of Tanzanian Bank Results in Retrenchment of Most Staff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 3 (Xinhua) -- About 70 percent of the
workers of Tanzania's largest commercial bank will be sacked
following the sale of the bank to a South African company last
week, the regional East African weekly newspaper reported on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Employers of the National Bank of Commerce (NBC) of Tanzania
have been told by the new owners of the former state bank, the
Amalgamated Banks of South Africa (ABSA), that some 733 out of a
total of 1,100 workers must be retrenched, about 350 of them
"soon".
</P>
<P>
Although ABSA promised before purchasing NBC that it would
retain and re- train the staff and equip the bank with the latest
banking technology, it seems to be backtracking on its promise
hardly a week after taking it over on March 31, the report said.
</P>
<P>
ABSA, a controversial owner of the former state bank, last week
paid 15 billion Tanzanian shillings (18 million U.S. dollars) for
purchasing 70 percent of the shares. The Tanzanian government
still retains 30 percent of the shares.
</P>
<P>
With the privatization program of more big state institutions
to be implemented in the next 18 months, analysts said more than
7,000 Tanzanians may be retrenched.

LUANDA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government and the
Antwerp's High Council on Diamonds of Belgium have signed an
accord to combat gem trafficking and to create "transparent
control of the diamond trade", according to an official statement
reaching here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said that the accord followed the visit to
Angola in March by Belgian Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Louis
Michel and the issuance of a U.N. report on the violation of the
sanctions against the Angolan rebels in which Belgium was accused
of being one of the violators.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, new certificates of origin and importation
will be implemented to allow the immediate identification of
diamonds.
</P>
<P>
According to figures revealed by the Angolan government, the
country's parallel diamond market produced some 563,000 carats of
diamonds, valued at 140 million U.S. dollars, in the first half of
1999.

TOKYO, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi
is in a coma and breathing with the help of an artificial
respirator, Chief Cabinet Secretary and Acting Prime Minister
Mikio Aoki said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The top Japanese government spokesman said Obuchi's medical
condition is "unpredictable," admitting that it is unavoidable for

take place. I have to closely monitor the course of his condition
before making a decision," Aoki said.

<HEADLINE> 46 Harbor Seals Return to Ocean Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, April 3 (Xinhua) -- After swimming around the ship
twice, 26 baby harbor seals have returned to their ocean home,
following a group of 20 that returned to the water last month.
</P>
<P>
The 46 harbor seals were rescued by Chinese fishermen in
northeast China's Liaoning Province when they were abandoned by
their parents in February.
</P>
<P>
The baby seals, about one month old, were left on seashores and
ice floes, but were soon taken to a shelter especially opened for
them. Twenty of the seals were released in early March when the
floes melted, and the rest stayed for some health reasons.
</P>
<P>
To further arouse people's awareness of animal protection, the
Chinese Ministry of Agriculture and relevant departments of the
Liaoning Provincial government held a special ceremony for the
returning seals.
</P>
<P>
Harbor seals are under intensified national care and protection
in China. They live in the bay near Liaoning in the winter time
and give birth to their young on the ice floes.
</P>
<P>
There used to be more than 10,000 harbor seals in the Bohai Bay
near Tianjin Municipality, and the Yellow Sea in east China.
Harbor seals are endangered as their number has dropped
drastically to some 1,000 because of hunting in the past two
decades.

"My father was recognized by people from all over the country
for his spirit of serving the people," he said. "I, along with my
colleagues, will continue to be so considerate to the customers
that they'll feel at home here."
</P>
<P>
Among the 200-plus brands of candy he sells is one named after
his father. According to the editor of the store's internal
newspaper "Flame Times", Li Ailing, Zhang Binggui Candy is the
star of the display. During the seven-day Spring Festival period
this year, a record 830 kg of Zhang Binggui Candy was sold, one
third of the counter's total sale.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Chaohe said that he spends a lot of his spare time
reading catering magazines and books to keep abreast of the latest
developments in the trade.
</P>
<P>
He said, "People should eat milk- or chocolate-based sweets in
winter to resist cold, and bigger people should go for fruit-juice
brands. I also strongly recommend orange and litchi types and, for
diabetics, sugar-free candies."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Like his late father, Zhang Chaohe
has shot to fame by titillating the tastebuds of countless locals
and tourists with probably the biggest, busiest candy counter in
China.
</P>
<P>
Every day, hundreds of people queue at his counter at the
Beijing Wangfujing Department Store. As the customers almost
completely ignore the 12 women sales clerks standing beside him,
he has to jump around, arms waving, like a football goalkeeper.
</P>
<P>
Some people don't come to buy: They just want their children to
see this living legend among sweet-sellers. "Look!" they say to
their youngsters, "That's Zhang Binggui's son."
</P>
<P>
Zhang Binggui, who died in 1987, was a national model worker
for almost three decades. He joined the store in 1955 at the age
of 36, and set an immediate example by his enthusiasm and
dedication to his new job. He invented such skills as "yibazhun",
meaning that when a customer wanted, say, 500 grams of a
particular candy, Zhang would scoop up the precise amount at first
try. After his death, the government erected a statue to him in
front of the store.
</P>
<P>
Last August, the store re-opened after lengthy redecoration. It
also wanted new attractions for the customers, so Zhang Chaohe was
transferred from the toy counter to step into his father's shoes
and follow in his tradition.
</P>
<P>
Zhang the younger, 40, knows that he has an illustrious
tradition to uphold. Reminding him of his inheritance is a huge
grainy black and white photo of his father hanging behind the
circular sweet counter.

<HEADLINE> Researchers Find Best Time to Detect Liver Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese researchers have
discovered an early sensitive period for the clinical detection of
liver cancer and the best time to launch a general survey of the
disease.
</P>
<P>
Today's Science and Technology Daily reported that researchers
at the No. 2 Hospital attached to Jiangxi Medical College made
their discoveries during a major research program on the early
detection of liver cancer.
</P>
<P>
A researcher with the hospital said that based on comparison of
50,000 pieces of liver cancer data collected from three regions in
China at different latitudes, the research group has calculated
time parameters for the early diagnosis of liver cancer.
</P>
<P>
The three regions were chosen according to a liver cancer
morality map created by the tumor prevention office of the
Ministry of Health.
</P>
<P>
This research will also lay a theoretical basis for the
tumorized mechanism of liver calls, and the time and procedures
for controlling tumorized genes and detection of liver cancer.
</P>
<P>
These discoveries have passed the appraisal of experts from the
provincial science and technology commission of Jiangxi Province
in east China.
</P>
<P>
The experts believe the discoveries will be of great importance
to basic liver cancer clinical research.

<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have announced
their discovery of the cause of the Hepatitis B virus in embryos
in the mother's womb.
</P>
<P>
A research group at the No.4 Medical University of the Chinese
People's Liberation Army (PLA), led by Professor Xu Dezhong, found
that threatened abortion may cause damaged blood capillaries in
the placenta, and the blood of the mother with a high Hepatitis B
virus content may enter the embryo.
</P>
<P>
If the embryo is infected with the Hepatitis B virus in the
womb, the Hepatitis B vaccine will have no effect, scientists say.
</P>
<P>
The group started their research 1992, and the cause of this
particular infection was one of their key projects.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Pursues FTAs With Partners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Singapore is pursuing free trade
agreements (FTAs) with several potential partners as a precaution
against possible trouble in the World Trade Organization (WTO),
Singapore Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong indicated at a
seminar Monday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Work Plan Seminar of the Monetary Authority of
Singapore (MAS), Lee, who is also MAS chairman, said, "We are
pursuing free trade agreements with several potential partners"
because "we need a fall-back position in case WTO runs into
trouble."
</P>
<P>
"After the fiasco of the Seattle ministerial meeting, such a
scenario has become less unlikely," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that Singapore has benefited from trade
liberalization at the WTO, Lee said FTAs will lead to further
opening up of the financial sector and other countries are doing
the same, citing the market enlargement of the European Union, the
expected establishment of a Free Trade Area of the Americas and
the idea of a North Asia free trade area.
</P>
<P>
The EU is enlarging its markets through FTAs with East European,
African and Latin American economies. North and South Americas,
including the United States, aim to conclude a Free Trade Area of
the Americas by 2005. Japan and South Korea have mooted the idea
of a Northeast Asia FTA.
</P>
<P>
"But otherwise, amidst this flurry of activity, Asia has been
conspicuously quiet," the deputy prime minister underlined.
</P>
<P>
Lee emphasized that the FTA strategy is an insurance policy for
his country, saying FTAs will keep Singapore away from being "left
out in the cold, should a weakened WTO fail to protect our
interests."
</P>
<P>
Singapore has embarked on FTA negotiations with New Zealand,
Japan and some South American countries in addition to its
involvement in the FTA plan of the ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
Lee said every partner in negotiations with Singapore will ask
for bilateral trade concessions beyond what his country has
committed in WTO and many of them want preferential market access
in services, particularly in financial service.
</P>
<P>
"For the U.S., this would be a major motivation for their
considering an FTA with Singapore," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Singapore financial institutions must clearly brace themselves
for the greater competition this development would bring," the
deputy prime minister stressed.

<HEADLINE> COMESA to Set Up Two Engineering Firms in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) is working on an engineering project with
two giant steel manufacturers in the sub-region to open two steel
and engineering works companies in Zambia, a senior official has
said.
</P>
<P>
Sindiso Ngwenya, COMESA assistant secretary-general, was quoted
by Monday's Zambia Daily Mail newspaper as saying that the opening
of these companies comes after the successful implementation of a
steel works program between Zimbabwe's Zisco Steel Makers which
has been running for the past three years.
</P>
<P>
The development of steel works in the regional grouping's
member states is one of the many projects which the COMESA embarks
on to make the area a successful trading place and economic
center, he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed to the expanding steel works between Kenya and
Zimbabwe as testimony of the authority's determination to ensure
that development takes root in the region and spreads to all other
member countries.
</P>
<P>
"In Zimbabwe, we have the largest steel works manufacturing
plant. The plant has been at the center of activities in the last
three years that cooperation was enhanced between the two
countries and as COMESA, we're happy that integration is not only
in the area of zero-rating on tariffs but in company expansions as
well," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Ngwenya, COMESA has trained 500 maintenance
engineers in the region to enhance the steel works operations and
engineering in the sub- region.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Issues 125 Mining Exploration Licences </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has over the
past year issued 125 mining exploration licences, some of which
are expected to result in development of new mines, the Times of
Zambia newspaper reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Mines Minister Syamukayumbu Syamujaye as
saying that these licences were issued to both local and foreign
investors as it is the only way the mining industry could develop
in the country.
</P>
<P>
Among the companies issued with exploration licences is
Caledonia, a British company engaged in exploration work on a
diamond mine in the Western Province of Zambia, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said Caledonia has finished exploring the prospective
diamond mine and has taken the mineral deposit samples for
laboratory testing.
</P>
<P>
According to Syamujaye, mining is a major foreign exchange
earner for Zambia which needs to be fully developed.
</P>
<P>
The mines, once established, would help boost direct capital
inflows into the mining sector and reshape the economy.

<HEADLINE> Three Burundian Rebel Members Held at Dar Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Three members of a Burundian
armed rebel group are being held at the Dar es Salaam
International Airport (DIA) for entering Tanzania without valid
travel documents, the Guardian newspaper reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The trio of the rebel group PALIPEHUTU-FLN (the Hutu People's
Liberation Party-the National Liberation Force), including the
leader Kabura Korsan, were arrested last Wednesday on arrival at
the DIA from South Africa where they had gone for consultations
with international mediator in the Burundi conflict, Nelson
Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Mark Bomani, head of the Burundi facilitation team, confirmed
that the FLN delegates, whose names could not be obtained, were
until the end of the week in the hands of the Tanzanian
immigration authorities.
</P>
<P>
The long-running peace talks between the Burundian government
and opposition groups have been handicapped by the absence of two
main armed Hutu rebel groups, FNL and CNDD-FDD (the National
Defense Council of Democracy-the Defense Force of Democracy).
</P>
<P>
In South Africa, the two main groups made a conditional promise
to Mandela to join the next round of talks scheduled for 25 April,
this year.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, fighting between Hutu rebels and the
Tutsi-dominated army in the tiny central African country has
killed more than 200,000 Burundians and uprooted more than 1.2
million others.

<P>
LUSAKA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's resident doctors who
withdrew their labor last December have agreed to resume work
after their proposals are ratified, the Times of Zambia newspaper
reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Resident Doctors Association of Zambia (RDA) general secretary
Canisius Banda disclosed on Sunday that his executive had a very

After a number of consultations, the doctors met Mpamba for the
crucial meeting at which they integrated their proposals and
prepared a document for ratification, he said.
</P>

"We have made a number of proposals and we will resume work
immediately after they are ratified," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the proposals included improved conditions of service
and an inducement allowance for doctors working in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
RDA had recommended that doctors working in rural areas should
be getting about 30-40 percent of their basic salaries as an
allowance to motivate them because of the hardships they go
through.
</P>
<P>
It also demanded that the recently bought drugs which were
locked up at the government's stores should be distributed in the

CHANGSHA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- China's accession to the World
Trade Organization (WTO) will bring Hunan Province an additional
200,000 job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Specialists at the Hunan Provincial Labor and Social Security

the service trades will get 100,000 more job opportunities.
</P>

The experts noted that the main impact of China's accession to
the WTO on the province's employment situation might not be shown
in the increase or decrease of total jobs, but in the adjustment
of employment structure and the improvement in workers' quality.
</P>
<P>
Employment in agriculture and machine building will plummet,
but the chemical and light industries, construction and real

<HEADLINE> China Produces 20 Billion Garments Per Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- China, the world's largest textile
and garment producer, now turns out more than 20 billion garments
a year, tantamount to three garments for every person on Earth.
</P>
<P>
China ranks first in the annual production capacity of cotton
textiles, woolen fabrics, and chemical fiber garments, processing
one-fourth of the world's fibers each year, according to State
Administration of Textile Industry (SATI) sources.
</P>
<P>
The textile sector was long China's pillar industry until the
late 1980s when the sector's outdated equipment and bloated
personnel stymied fast growth and profit.
</P>
<P>
Through two years of restructuring in 1998 to 1999, the
industry has made progress in cutting losses and reducing the
number of spindles and employees.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, the sector had cut down its production
capacity by scrapping 9.06 million outmoded spindles and laying
off 1.16 million employees, and generated a net profit of 800
million yuan.
</P>
<P>
"China's textile sector has advantages in human and material
resources in competition with its foreign counterparts," said Wang
Tiankai, deputy director of SATI, adding that it is particularly
so after the industry has kept improving its export product mix
for higher added value in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
"However, it lags behind in management and design capability,
posing a threat to the industry's development after China joins
the World Trade Organization, said Wang.
</P>
<P>
Chinese textile and garment exports now account for 13 percent
of the world's total and 23 percent of the country's domestic
exports. The sector earned 43.1 billion U.S. dollars last year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Financial Institutions Preparing for Comprehensive Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese financial institutions
will be permitted to engage in various financial transactions
under unified supervision in the future, but the principle on
operating in the lines of banking, securities and insurance will
remain unchanged at present, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
Xia Bin of the People's Bank of China, the central bank, said,
however, that the general trend is toward unified supervision of
financial institutions offering comprehensive services.
</P>
<P>
At present, Chinese financial institutions are divided into the
categories of banking, securities, insurance, and others, and
different categories have different regulators.
</P>
<P>
As China seeks entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO),
the financial sector should prepare itself for the coming
challenges, said Xia, who is in charge of supervision of non-bank
institutions at the central bank.
</P>
<P>
Irregularities should be eliminated and supervision
strengthened, with new and comprehensive laws and regulations.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the separate operations of banking, securities, and
insurance must remain unchanged, he said, but added that
experiments could be made within the present system. For instance,
insurance companies could be allowed access to the stock market,
and securities firms to the inter-bank market.

<HEADLINE> HIV/AIDS Situation Could Worsen in China: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- An increasing number of HIV
infections and the appearance of a new HIV strain could worsen the
AIDS situation in China, health experts warned.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, there were 4,677 confirmed HIV positive cases here, a
rise of 41.5 percent over 1998, and the number of AIDS patients
increased by 69.1 percent in the same period, according to the
Department of Disease Control under the Ministry of Health (MOH).
</P>
<P>
Confirmed HIV/AIDS cases totaled 17,316 by the end of last year,
including 647 fully developed AIDS patients, among whom 356 died.
The MOH estimates that the infection has in fact reached 400,000
people or even more.
</P>
<P>
"The figure has been rocketing for successive five years, and
rampant sexually transmitted diseases and co-infection of HIV and
tuberculosis may make the situation worse," said Dai Zhicheng,
vice-chairman of the Chinese Association of STD and AIDS
Prevention and Control.
</P>
<P>
The MOH Center for AIDS Prevention and Control also confirmed
that a novel HIV strain has been detected in China, which may make
the situation more complicated.
</P>
<P>
Two carriers of HIV-2, which mainly prevails in Africa, both
had working experience in west Africa, the China Daily reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a MOH official as saying that efforts should
be made to accurately diagnose these new cases, since tests are at
present only able to detect the HIV-1 antibody.

China's top universities directly under the Ministry of Education.
</P>
<P>
Beijing University distinguishes itself by its rigorous style
of study, prominent academic standing and fruitful educational
achievements.
</P>
<P>
It has descended from the Metropolitan University (Jingshi
Daxutang) of the Qing Dynasty, which was a product of the Reform
Movement of 1898.
</P>
<P>

returned to Peiping (then the name of Beijing, or Peking). At that
time, the university had the schools of arts, science, law,
medicine, engineering, and agriculture, as well as a research
institute for the humanities. The total enrollment of students
grew to 3,000.
</P>
<P>
In order to carry on the revolutionary tradition of the May 4th
Movement, the university decided, after new China was founded in
1949, that the May 4th be set as the date on which to celebrate
the anniversary of its founding.
</P>
<P>
Beijing University has a beautiful campus, which is located at
Haidian District, an area in the western suburbs of Beijing
renowned in the old days for its gardens and parks. The campus,
known as "Yan Yuan".

Yuan Palace, and to the west is the Summer Palace. The lovely
campus itself, with attractive scenery.

WELLINGTON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The Pacific plate moving under
the Australasian plate, which New Zealand is on, caused the
earthquakes in New Zealand last week, The Dominion reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Wellington was rocked twice in a week. On Saturday morning it
was jolted by an earthquake measuring 5.3 on the Richter scale,
centered about 20 kilometers from Picton, a town on South Island,
at a depth of 50 kilometers. It followed a similar one on Thursday
morning measuring 5.7, centered 10 kilometers northwest of
Greytown, a town on North Island.
</P>
<P>
Several aftershocks were felt, including one measuring 4.4 and
another measuring 4. Both stemmed from the Picton quake.
</P>
<P>
The Wellington-based newspaper quoted Ken Gledhill, a
seismologist at the Institute of Geological and Nuclear Sciences
of New Zealand, as saying that both the Greytown quake and Picton
quake were caused by the Pacific plate moving.
</P>
<P>
"In both places there'll be aftershocks for the next couple of
weeks. It is possible that either of these earthquakes will lead
on to something bigger but it's unlikely," Gledhill said.

BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The State Administration of
Taxation (SAT) is readjusting China's tax structure to meet the
WTO requirements, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Faguang, deputy director of SAT, said the government will
revise relevant regulations which do not tally with WTO rules and
on anti-dumping, subsidies, and on coinciding the policies towards
Chinese enterprises and enterprises involving overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
Practices prohibited by WTO rules will have a grace period for
the transition, but will be changed in time to meet the
requirements of WTO member countries.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the country will use taxation as a lever to
facilitate its fledgling industries and sharpen the competitive
edges of some export-oriented industries in accordance with WTO
rules.
</P>
<P>
Cheng also said that taxation irregularities will be
straightened out, especially in rural areas, to reduce the impact
WTO entry will have on Chinese farmers.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen
has called for further studies of the country's traditional dragon
culture.
</P>
<P>
This year is the Year of the Dragon on the Chinese lunar
calendar, and a cultural festival featuring the fabled creature
will take place in Dongfang city in south China's island province
of Hainan on April 6.
</P>
<P>
In his message to the upcoming festival, Qian said that it is
quite necessary this year to make further studies into the
spiritual connotations of traditional dragon culture.
</P>
<P>
Qian, also member of the Political Bureau of the Communist
Party of China Central Committee, noted that dragon culture
represents, above all, the unity and synergy inherent in the
Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that the fabled dragon is a combination
of features from many animals, such as deer, elephant, snake, fish,
tiger and hawk.
</P>
<P>
All the ancient tribes of the Chinese nation took animals as
their totems, and eventually the dragon came to be their commonly
recognized cultural symbol in the process of national integration,
embodying the wishes of all Chinese nationalities, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese dragon dances and dragon boat races, which originated
from ancient dragon worshipping ceremonies, also demand unity and
cooperation of the entire team, Qian said. And no individual can
perform dragon dances or take part in boat races.
</P>
<P>
"The dragon represents the unity and coherence of the Chinese
nation," the vice-premier said, noting that the traditional
culture of the dragon embodies the truth of the saying that
strength comes from unity.

<HEADLINE> Australian Aboriginal Activist Attacks Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Aboriginal activist Charles
Perkins Accused Monday the Australian Federal government of being
racist.
</P>
<P>
Perkins was quoted by AAP as saying that drawing a parallel
between the stolen generation and the Jewish Holocaust was
legitimate because the principle was the same, whatever the
difference in the number of people killed.
</P>
<P>
Aboriginal children had been took away from their parents to
governmental organizations and white men's home under a policy of
national assimilation, whom people call "the stolen generation".
</P>
<P>
Aboriginal Affairs Minister John Herron denied Sunday there had
been ever "the stolen generation" saying that the term was a
misnomer.
</P>
<P>
Perkins warned against a demonstration during the Sydney
Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
"It's burn, baby, burn from now on. Anything can happen."
</P>
<P>
When asked what he meant, Perkins said: "I'm talking about
demonstrations."
</P>
<P>
"This country is a racist country and it will pay in the
oncoming generations for what they are doing at the present time,"
he said adding that "This man here (Aboriginal Affairs Minister
John Herron), and this prime minister, are the worst we've ever
had. Not so much Herron, he's just a messenger boy for Howard."
</P>
<P>
National relations between the Australian government and
Aboriginals have been intense since a 15-years-old Aboriginal boy
suicided in custody in the Northern Territory on 10 February. He
was sentenced by the "Mandatory Sentencing Law" to 28 days of
detention for stealing stationery valued about 30 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
There are Mandatory Sentencing laws only in the Northern
Territory and the Western Australian state where most Aboriginals
of the country are living.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Howard refused to interfere in the local
judicature though believed himself the law was not good. His
attitude caused criticism not only from Aboriginals but also from
the United Nations.

<HEADLINE> Xinhua Commentary Urges New Methods of Ideological Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- A commentary of China's official
news agency Xinhua has called for exploring new methods of
ideological work that are fit to the country's new situation.
</P>
<P>
"Ideological and political work has been a good tradition and
political advantage of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC)", the
commentary said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few decades, the CPC has accumulated a lot of
experiences and created many effective methods, which played an
important role in both the revolution and the country's
construction.
</P>
<P>
Despite of many advantages, the party's ideological work faces
challenges from the Western values, diversification of economic
factors and interests, as well as new ways of information
acquisition such as the Internet, it said.
</P>
<P>
"Ideological and political work has to be centered around the
country's economic construction, and serve the overall interests
of reform, development and stability," the commentary explained.
</P>
<P>
It is imperative to combine ideological work with solutions to
practical issues of the masses, it stated.
</P>
<P>
To care for the masses has been a good tradition of the party,
the commentary said, adding ideological work can only become
effective when sincere efforts are taken to tackle with issues
that the masses care about.
</P>
<P>
The commentary also noted that more emphasis has to be devoted
to management if the ideological work hopes to become more
effective.

<HEADLINE> Japanese PM Suffers Stroke, Aoki Named Acting Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi
has suffered a stroke and is in intensive care in a Tokyo hospital,
said Chief Cabinet Secretary Mikio Aoki on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Aoki has been appointed acting prime minister by Obuchi when
he visited the prime minister in hospital on Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
"Obuchi said we could not have any delay in our measures to
cope with the volcanic eruption so he appointed me as acting prime
minister," Aoki told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi won't be able to return to his duties for two or three
days, Aoki said.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi, 62, was hospitalized at Tokyo's Juntendo University
Hospital early Sunday for exhaustion and transferred to the
intensive care unit at about 8 p.m. Sunday (1100 GMT). His
condition was kept secret for 22 hours.
</P>
<P>
At Monday's news conference, Aoki refused to specify on
Obuchi's condition. Asked by journalists if Obuchi's illness was
life-threatening, Aoki said, "I don't know." He also refused to
comment on whether the prime minister was operated on.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi's illness is expected to have little immediate impact
on the government's day-to-day operations. However, his
hospitalization, if prolonged, may affect the summit of the Group
of Eight most industrialized nations scheduled for July in Okinawa,
Japan.
</P>
<P>
Aoki said he would call an emergency meeting of the cabinet at
about noon Monday to discuss the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi has had a heavy schedule over the past few days.
</P>
<P>
The Mount Usu volcano in the northern island of Hokkaido
erupted on Friday after dormant for more than 20 years, forcing
tens of thousands of residents to evacuate.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi was also in talks with the Liberal Party, a ruling
alliance of his Liberal Democratic Party. He failed to stop the
Liberal Party to quit the ruling coalition.

<HEADLINE> Elian's Father Ready to Go to U.S. Alone, Castro Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is a change to an earlier proposal that a 30-member
delegation will accompany Juan Miquel Gonzalez to the United
States as there have been objections from the U.S. side, according
to Castro speaking on national television.
</P>
<P>
Elian, who is currently under the custody of his great uncle,
Lazaro Gonzalez, in Florida, was rescued on November 25 last year
from a shipwreck after his mother and 11 others died when the boat
capsized in the sea off Florida.
</P>
<P>
The president quoted Elian's father as saying that "If it's a
case of handing the boy over for his immediate return to Cuba, I
am ready to leave tomorrow, Monday, April 3, absolutely alone,"
adding it is up to Washington to decide.
</P>
<P>
However, Castro said, quoting Miquel Gonzalez, that if it takes
two months for a U.S. appeals court to rule on Elian's case, the
father and relatives still want an accompany by a delegation
during the trip to the United States.

CANBERRA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Mark Philippoussis Monday decided

<HEADLINE> Model Farm to be Set Up in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka is to establish a model
farm named "Millennium Village" in the north of the country under
a project to set up agricultural farms in each division in the
North-East Province, the official Daily News said Monday.
</P>
<P>
President Chandrika Kumaratunga has directed the establishment
of the farm for 250 families at Vavuniya, 254 kilometers north of
Colombo, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The farm is to be set up in 275 acres of land with each family
allocated one acre while the balance 25 acres will be a common
area for cattle farming, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The boundaries of the farms should have fruit trees and a fruit
canning factory should be established for the project.
</P>
<P>
The president has proposed that the project be expanded further
for which she was prepared to grant 30 million rupees (410,000 U.S.
dollars) per farm.
</P>
<P>
Under the project each allottee would be given a free block of
land and 50,000 rupees (685 dollars) as a settling down loan,
repayable over a period of time.
</P>
<P>
Seeds will be supplied to the farmers while technology will be
provided free, the report added.

<TEXT>
<P>
In the real estate sector, the high prices of housing has
dampened people's house-buying desire.
</P>
<P>
Calculation indicates that 55 percent of the price has been
taken up by various taxes and fees, including the investment
orientation adjustment tax. If some of the fees and taxes can be
abolished or reduced, the price would go down considerably. Then
with the support of fiscal discount interest and housing loans,
the real estate sector will certainly prosper. The state revenue
will consequently gain more from the thriving real estate market
than what it has lost in its payment for discounted interest and
the reduction of taxes and fees.
</P>
<P>
To drive up the economy, the role of local governments should
not be ignored.
</P>
<P>
Funds raised by the local governments can effectively help the
central government activate local economies.
</P>
<P>
But according to the Budget Law, local governments can not
issue treasury bonds without permission of laws or the State
Council.
</P>
<P>
The State Council, therefore, could allow those credit-worthy
local governments to raise funds to stem economic stagnation,
under the condition that the central government exert strict
control and supervision on the usage of the treasury bonds.

<P>
Fiscal payment for discount interest will not get direct
benefit form the projects it assists. It aims to bring along
capital from banks and corporations involved, which would manifest
better results than using them as direct investment.
</P>
<P>
The range of fiscal discount interest should be extended to
more industries with high inter-relativity, such as the real
estate sector.
</P>
<P>
At present, there is a strong demand for housing. But due to
limitations of exorbitant price and relatively meagre incomes,
ordinary citizens cannot translate their demand into real
consumption. Here, discount interest could be granted to home
buyers to jazz up the stagnant real estate market and other
related industries.
</P>
<P>
When implementing proactive fiscal policies, income policy,
such as removal of certain taxes and fees, can be adopted. (

And the introduction of public investment can spare state input
to carry out some projects and give more vitality to the economy.
</P>
<P>
It is very difficult, however, for private enterprises to
finance. They lack guarantees for help. The state should allow
private companies especially for public investment. This not only
spares capital for state revenue, but is conducive to expanding
public investment and boosting the overall economy.
</P>
<P>
To activate the economy, investing in manufacturing projects
can be a good choice.
</P>
<P>
When government investment is used to increase market demand,
it will have a great bearing on the results of investment. It is
necessary to invest in infrastructure, which lay foundations for
sustainable development of the economy.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the manufacturing industry, however, it is less
powerful in driving up the economy because the manufacturing
industry is interrelated more closely with other industries.
</P>
<P>
A rational industrial combination should be made to receive the
state investment. Apart from key infrastructure projects, some
manufacturing projects should be given priority in receiving
government investment.
</P>
<P>
Fiscal payment for discounted interest, especially in real
estate, should also be encouraged to make full use of the limited
finances.

BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- With deflation continuing to nag
China's economy, a proactive fiscal policy remains necessary this
year.
</P>
<P>
However, flexible strategies should be implemented so that
limited fiscal spending may be used to drive up demand.
</P>
<P>
This is the viewpoint of Dong Furen, deputy director of the
Economic Commission of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, in a signed article in today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Despite its significant boost to the economy, continuing
proactive policy has worsened the deficit and will aggravate the
burden of the revenue in coming years. Moreover, it may trigger
inflation.
</P>
<P>
Under this circumstance, flexible strategies should be mapped
out to make full use of State input to invigorate the economy.
</P>
<P>
Currently, government investment is the main force boosting
effective demand, while public investment remains stagnant.
</P>
<P>
The increased demand until now mainly came from government
input in fixed assets. Except in well-developed coastal areas,
there has been no significant increase in public investment.
</P>
<P>
The stagnation of public investment comes from the lack of
investment channels to accommodate them.
</P>
<P>
The financial, insurance and telecommunications sectors, for
example, have not been accessible to public investment until now.
</P>
<P>
China is seeking entry to the World Trade Organization (WTO),
which demands opening of these sectors to foreign investors. It is
unreasonable to block domestic investors from entering the market.

ZAGREB, April 2 (Xinhua) -- A new political party called the
Croatian Democratic Center was founded on Sunday with former
deputy prime minister and foreign minister Mate Granic as its head.
</P>
<P>
In a speech after his election, Granic announced that bringing
Croatia into the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty
Orgainzation was his party's diplomatic priority, Croatian Radio
and Television reported.
</P>
<P>
The party's domestic policy would be focused on the uplifting
of the lives of the low-income population.
</P>
<P>
Granic decided in March to quit the former ruling Croatian
Democratic Union (HDZ) to form a new party after he was defeated
as HDZ's presidential candidate by Stipe Mesic, a People's Party
figure.
</P>
<P>
The formation of the new party symbolizes the open split of the
HDZ once controlled by late president Franjo Tudjman, who died on
December 10, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Granic, a moderate member of the HDZ, left the party among
disputes with hard-liners. Granic blamed the HDZ's internal
bickering for his defeat in the presidential race.

<HEADLINE> E-Commerce Boom Expected in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President of Boston Consulting Group (BCG) Bernd Waltermann
said Indonesia undoubtedly had high potential as a market for E-
commerce,but the business could not pick up that fast because of
the problems of infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia is only a nascent E-commerce market at present. But
we expect to see very steep growth in the near future in line with
the country's full recovery," he was quoted by the Jakarta Post
Monday as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent survey conducted by BCG in 14 Asia-
Pacific countries, Indonesia, together with China, India, Thailand,
Malaysia and the Philippines, is among one of the nascent E-
commerce markets in the region due to its undeveloped Internet
infrastructures that hamper the wide spread of E-commerce in the
areas.
</P>
<P>
According to Indonesia's state telecommunications firms PT
Telkom,there are now 2.06 million telephone lines, an estimated
three to four million personal computers and over one million
Internet users in Indonesia, which has a population of more than
200 million.
</P>
<P>
BCG's survey found that in terms of online spending per capita,
Indonesia with an online spending of only 0.01 U.S. cents per
capita in 1999 was left behind India, which during the period
recorded 0.03 cents per capita in online spending, or Thailand
with 0.2 cents per capita or Malaysia with 0.5 cents per capita.
</P>
<P>
The survey predicts Indonesia's Internet users will swell from
about one million at present to over four million in 2003.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Tory Leader to Fight On for Party Label </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Canada's Tory leader Joe Clark
Sunday vowed to fight on for the exclusive use of the party label
"Conservative."
</P>
<P>
Clark told reporters in Victoria, British Columbia, that he
would bring to the Federal Court of Canada later this month a
ruling by Elections Canada that the new party of the Canadian
Reform Conservative Alliance can keep the sensitive word "
Conservative."
</P>
<P>
Chief Electoral Officer Jean-Pierre Kingsley ruled early in the
day that "the proposed name Canadian Reform Conservative Alliance
does not so nearly resemble the name of any of the parties in our
registry so as to likely be confused with any of those parties."
</P>
<P>
In an immediate counter-argument, Clark stated "that name --
Conservative -- has been our name historically. It's our name."
</P>
<P>
"It is the name by which we have been known for more than a
century, the name under which Macdonald formed the country and
formed the party," said the Tory leader.
</P>
<P>
"We have fought and won elections across the country under that
name for all of that time," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Led by the country's official opposition leader Preston Manning,
the Reform Party voted last weekend to take the new name of the
Canadian Reform Conservative Alliance to represent a broader-based
party of both Reformers and provincial Conservatives, mainly from
Alberta and Ontario.
</P>
<P>
Manning urged Reformers to "think big" in favor of a more
powerful conservative political movement so as to prevent the
Liberals from a third successive win in the next federal elections.
</P>
<P>
The Reform party, which has its roots in western Canada and
enjoys 60 seats in the House of Commons, is looking forward to
having support of the ruling Conservatives in Ontario, which
accounts for no less than 103 of the 301 Parliament seats.
</P>
<P>
Unlike provincial Conservatives, or the so-called "small-c
conservative movement," the federal Progressive Conservatives
prefer to remain an independent opposition party in Parliament
with 20 seats.
</P>
<P>
Clark has repeatedly argued against the use of "Conservative"
by the Canadian Alliance and has asked Elections Canada to block
the attempts by the new party to pass itself off to voters as a
union between Reformers and Conservatives as a whole.

<HEADLINE> South China's Guangxi Exports More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, April 3 (Xinhua) --South China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region did 258 million U.S. dollars in foreign trade in
the first two months of the year.
</P>
<P>
Information from the regional foreign trade and economic
cooperation bureau noted that the volume represents a rise of 14.3
percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Out of the total foreign trade volume, exports made up 206
million U.S. dollars, up 40 percent from that of last year.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, the autonomous region approved overseas-
financed projects with contracted investment of 122 million U.S.
dollars, of which, 75.14 million U.S. dollars was placed in. Both
figures show sharp increases over that of last year.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi, with a territory of 230,000 sq km, is home to 11 major
ethnic groups, including Zhuang, Miao, Yao, Maonan and Gin. The
region has more favorable geographic conditions for doing foreign
trade than its other neighbors as it faces the Beibu Gulf in the
south border.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Market in Scenic City to be Restored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUILIN, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The government of south China's
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region will allocate 11 million yuan (
about 1.3 million U.S.dollars) for restoring a 2,200-year-old
trading market in its famous scenic city of Guilin.
</P>
<P>
Known as Daxu Town, the market first appeared in 200 B.C. and
grew into a brisk trading center and became most famous by Ming
Dynasty (1368-1644) when businessmen from across the country came
to make fortune there.
</P>
<P>
The investment will be used to construct gate towers, ancient-
style residential houses and shops, said local sources.
</P>
<P>
The entire reconstruction project will be finished later this
year.
</P>
<P>
The move is considered as a way to attract more tourists to
Guilin, also an old city with a history of more than 2,000 years
and renowned for its green mountains, clear water and strangely-
shaped stone formations.

<HEADLINE> "Green Lottery" Proposed For Environmental Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, April 3 (Xinhua) -- A government advisor in east
China's Zhejiang Province has proposed that China run a "green
lottery" to support the national afforestation campaign.
</P>
<P>
Shao Shusheng, a member of the Jiande Municipal Committee of
Zhejiang Province of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), said the task of preventing soil erosion and
desertification is formidable, and it is very difficult for the
government to allocate sufficient funds for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
So a "green lottery" might help solve the problem, he said." I
believe many people will buy lottery tickets because people
nowadays are more conscious of environmental protection," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested the lottery should strongly emphasize the
theme of environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
China's vegetation and afforestation coverage is only 13
percent and the per capital coverage is only 11.3 percent of the
world average. The country's desertification is so serious that it
has hindered the development of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Realizing the seriousness of the problem, China's State Council
last year called on all localities to reclaim barren hills, plant
trees, and create green belts in coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
China began issuing lotteries in 1987 and has sold some 35
billion yuan (4.2 billion U.S. dollars) worth of tickets in the
past 12 years.
</P>
<P>
China now has sports, welfare, education, and computer
lotteries, all very popular among Chinese citizens.

<HEADLINE> On-line Drug Store Sells Contraceptives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, April 3 (Xinhua) -- "On-line Eden"--(http://202.102.
231.54/yidianyuan)-- is the first on-line store selling
contraceptives and other sexual aids set up by the Pingdingshan
Medicine and Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
In the first two days, five people have bought products on-line.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Dongjie, a chief official with the Center, said that the
reason for founding such a on-line store is because "we have
observed that many consumers are usually embarrassed to buy sexual
aids directly from drug stores."
</P>
<P>
The on-line store is projected to protect consumers privacy and
provides a convenient way for shopping. Sexual aids and other
medicines bought via the website can be delivered directly to
buyers, normally within an hour if the buyers are in Pingdingshan.
</P>
<P>
About 341 kinds of medicines, classified in six categories,
including contraceptives and medicines to treat and cure venereal
diseases, are available in the shop.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the western people, Chinese are generally shy or
conservative of talking about sex-related topics, even though the
government has been promoting sex education in schools across
China over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
When China's first contraceptive-selling store opened
cautiously in Beijing about a decade ago, it had to be closed from
time to time because of strong opposition from local residents.

<HEADLINE> Private Investors Encouraged to Develop Social Welfare Houses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Eleven ministries have jointly
proposed that non-governmental investors be encouraged to finance
social welfare institutions to shelter orphans, elderly people and
the handicapped.
</P>
<P>
The Proposal on Accelerating the Socialization of Social
Welfare by 11 ministries including the ministries of finance,
education and public health, issued by the General Office of the
State Council, says that China's welfare institutions are
insufficient to meet the social demand, though the sector has made
remarkable progress over the past five decades.
</P>
<P>
Non-governmental investors from all sections of society should
be encouraged to join hands with the government to develop social
welfare institutions, it says.
</P>
<P>
By 2005, a social welfare service network will be established
throughout the country, with government-run institutions as the
model and collective and private-owned units as the backbone,
community-based services as the supportive means, and home-care as
the basic form of welfare service.
</P>
<P>
Local governments should set directive targets for the
development of local welfare undertakings, and adopt favorable
policies concerning land-use, taxation, public utilities, medicare,
schooling and employment, in order to encourage non-governmental
investors to participate in this endeavor.

<HEADLINE> China Re-opens Jewish Cemetery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, April 3 (Xinhua) -- China has re-opened a cemetery for
members of the Jewish faith, prior to the traditional Tomb-
sweeping Day, which falls on April 4.
</P>
<P>
The cemetery, suited in this capital of northeast China's
Heilongjiang Province, is said to be the largest of its kind in
Asia.
</P>
<P>
Some 20,000 Jewish people came to the city after the completion
of the Trans-Siberian Railway in 1896. They built the first Jewish
cemetery in China in 1903, which later housed more than 2,000
tombs. In 1953, the local government moved 605 well-preserved
tombs to the current site, the Huangshan Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Jifa, an official in charge of local funeral affairs, said
that the cemetery is open to anybody who wants to pay respects
there, and that he hoped the relatives of the deceased would visit
the cemetery often. Cemetery workers have cleaned up the cemetery
and placed flowers in front of each of the tombs.

BRUSSELS, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Russian-born Belgian Andrei
Tchmil on Sunday won the second leg of this year's 10-race World
Cup cycling tour by taking the Tour des Flandres.
</P>
<P>
The 37-year-old reigning World Cup titlist proved his flare and

<P>
His winning time was six hours 57 minutes 3 seconds.

Italy's Dario Pieri finished four seconds behind as runner-up,
followed by Latvia's Romans Vainsteins.
</P>
<P>
Erik Zabel of Germany, winner of the opening leg of the World
Cup tour in Italy, finished fourth, but still kept his overall
leadership on the classification roster with 140 points. Second
now is Tchmil with 108 points.
</P>
<P>
"It's one of the best days in my life," said the winner. "I
gave it all I had and it was fantastic."
</P>
<P>
Peter van Petegem also of Belgium finished eighth, also four
seconds adrift the winner.
</P>
<P>
The Bruges-Meerbeke race consisted of asphalt and cobblestone
roads and several climbs in northwest Belgium. Tchmil described
Sunday's race course as "in my eyes the most beautiful course on
the World Cup circuit".
</P>
<P>
This year's World Cup tour ends in October with the Tour de

<HEADLINE> PNA, EU Sign Cooperative Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) and the European Union (EU) on Monday agreed to jointly
launch an air cargo section at the Gaza International Airport
(GIA).
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by Palestinian Minister of Planning and
International Cooperation Nabil Sha'ath and Chief of Civil Aviation
Authority Brigadier Faiz Zaidan and the EU commissioner for foreign
relations, Christopher Patin.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, the EU will provide the PNA with 25 million
euros (23.8 million U.S. dollars) to establish the air cargo
section within 10 months. The project will confirm the independence
of the Palestinian export-import movement from Israeli airlines.
</P>
<P>
The deal will facilitate the export-import movement between
Palestine and the world countries, according to Sha'ath who praised
the E.U. role in the Middle East peace process and in developing
the Palestinian economy.
</P>
<P>
Palestine received up to 350 million U.S. dollars out of 700
million in aid from the EU and the European Investment Bank over
the last six years, Sha'ath said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the EU official noted that the initiation of the air
transport section would contribute to the growth of the Palestinian
economy.
</P>
<P>
Patin, who started his visit to Palestine on Monday, said the
visit is important for the EU that has strong relations with the
PNA.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out the keenness of the EU on accelerating the
procedures of the accord implementation.
</P>
<P>
The GIA plays in important role in connecting Palestine with not
only the EU but also the world at large, he said, adding that the
airport will contribute greatly to the revival of Palestine in
various fields.

In this zone confrontations have been registered between

<HEADLINE> U.S. High-Tech Industry, NAM Support PNTR for China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Declaring the "PNTR is the single most important priority for
high-tech companies," the U.S. High-Tech Industry Coalition CEO
letter urges Congressional members to give their "strong support"
for extending PNTR status to China.
</P>
<P>
"We consider (the PNTR) vote the most critical vote you will
make in support of our high technology industries this year," said
the letter.
</P>
<P>
Citing China as a huge critical and fast growing market for
high-tech products and services, the letter said the fruits of
those many years of tough negotiating are at risk if Congress does
not establish PNTR with China.
</P>
<P>
Jim Whittaker of Hewlett-Packard Company, Chairman of the U.S.
High-Tech Industry Coalition on China, echoed the letter:"Now the
U.S. Congress needs to take its own step by making permanent the
same normal trade relations status that it has already been
approving annually for the past twenty years."
</P>
<P>
The coalition is made up of the leading technology associations
representing thousands of small to large technology companies from
around the U.S..
</P>
<P>
The Republican House leadership thanked the high-tech industry
CEOs for the letter's strong endorsement of the legislation.
</P>
<P>
"The overwhelming response from high-tech America, demonstrated
by this letter, underscores the importance of the China PNTR vote
this year. Opening markets around the world to American high-tech
products is crucial to keeping our economy vibrant and growing,"
said House majority Leader Dick Armey.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM)
Monday also called for PNTR with China at a news conference with
House Majority Leader Dick Armey.
</P>
<P>
"The facts are striking. Eighty-two percent of U.S. companies
that export to China are small and medium-sized firms and they all
want passage with PNTR with China," said NAM President Jerry
Jasinowski.
</P>
<P>
"They are not strangers to doing business overseas and are
committed to establishing PNTR with China because of the direct
connection to economic growth and jobs," he said. "The success of
our export strategy has always depended on a partnership between
smart manufacturers and results-oriented trade negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The NAM, the nation's largest and oldest multi-industry trade
association, represents 14,000 members (including 10,000 small and
mid-sized companies) and 350 member associations serving
manufacturers and employees in every industrial sector and all 50
states.

international arbitration which is being rejected by Belize's
government.
</P>
<P>
The land dispute between Guatemala and has its origin in a
border treaty signed in 1859 between Guatemala and Britain.
</P>
<P>
It would be convenient for Belize to look for the cooperation
of Canada or of certain African countries to solve this land
dispute, expressed the lawyer.
</P>
<P>
This controversy between Guatemala and Belize has engendered
several diplomatic, governmental and military brushings regarding
the border land between both nations.

<HEADLINE> British Museums to Cut Admission Cost Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Under plans to open up its cultural
heritage to a wider public, entry fees for many of England's
national museums could be cut to one pound (1.6 U.S. dollars) from
next year in a move which is likely to cost the government 7.1
million pounds.
</P>
<P>
The new charges, which fall short of the Labor government's
early aspirations to abolish entrance fees altogether, will take
effect from September 2001. People on welfare or with disabilities
will get in for free.
</P>
<P>
"I want to see the best of our culture and heritage made
available to the greatest possible number, regardless of their
income," Culture Secretary Chris Smith said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Some leading national museums, including the British Museum
which attracts 5.5 million visitors a year, charge no entry fee.
</P>
<P>
Charges for others range from five pounds at the Victoria and
Albert Museum to 6.95 pounds at the Science Museum and 7.50 pounds
at the Natural History Museum.
</P>
<P>
Free admission at charging museums was introduced for children
last year and will be extended to the over-60s later this year.
</P>
<P>
"For the first time in 20 years, affordable access to the best
of our cultural heritage really will be available for the many,
not the few," Smith said.
</P>
<P>
But some museums -- like the Natural History Museum -- maintain
that they have been able to run successful and attractive museums
because of their charging policies.
</P>
<P>
There are also fears that if entrance is free, museums would
lose their status as businesses and would no longer be able to
reclaim VAT on building projects.
</P>
<P>
In February, a major funding boost for the new Tate Modern
Gallery drew accusations that the government would no longer be
able to afford to fund universal free access.
</P>
<P>
The art gallery on London's south bank is to receive an
injection of 5 million pounds in the coming financial year, with
year-on-year increases of 6 million pounds thereafter, to ensure
free admission.

<HEADLINE> (rpt with correction)U.S. High-Tech Industry, NAM Support PNTR for China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Declaring the "PNTR is the single most important priority for
high-tech companies," the U.S. High-Tech Industry Coalition CEO
letter urges Congressional members to give their "strong support"
for extending PNTR status to China.
</P>
<P>
"We consider (the PNTR) vote the most critical vote you will
make in support of our high technology industries this year," said
the letter.
</P>
<P>
Citing China as a huge critical and fast growing market for
high-tech products and services, the letter said the fruits of
those many years of tough negotiating are at risk if Congress does
not establish PNTR with China.
</P>
<P>
Jim Whittaker of Hewlett-Packard Company, Chairman of the U.S.
High-Tech Industry Coalition on China, echoed the letter:"Now the
U.S. Congress needs to take its own step by making permanent the
same normal trade relations status that it has already been
approving annually for the past twenty years."
</P>
<P>
The coalition is made up of the leading technology associations
representing thousands of small to large technology companies from
around the U.S..
</P>
<P>
The Republican House leadership thanked the high-tech industry
CEOs for the letter's strong endorsement of the legislation.
</P>
<P>
"The overwhelming response from high-tech America, demonstrated
by this letter, underscores the importance of the China PNTR vote
this year. Opening markets around the world to American high-tech
products is crucial to keeping our economy vibrant and growing,"
said House majority Leader Dick Armey.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM)
Monday also called for PNTR with China at a news conference with
House Majority Leader Dick Armey.
</P>
<P>
"The facts are striking. Eighty-two percent of U.S. companies
that export to China are small and medium-sized firms and they all
want passage with PNTR with China," said NAM President Jerry
Jasinowski.
</P>
<P>
"They are not strangers to doing business overseas and are
committed to establishing PNTR with China because of the direct
connection to economic growth and jobs," he said. "The success of
our export strategy has always depended on a partnership between
smart manufacturers and results-oriented trade negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The NAM, the nation's largest and oldest multi-industry trade
association, represents 14,000 members (including 10,000 small and
mid-sized companies) and 350 member associations serving
manufacturers and employees in every industrial sector and all 50
states.

<P>
NAIROBI, April 3 (Xinhua) -- About 110 AIDS counsellors and
anti-AIDS club representatives in secondary and tertiary
institutions have been sensitized on AIDS prevention by the
Jerusalem AIDS project, Rwanda News Agency reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Silas Nzabonakura, who is in charge of information, education
and communication in the national AIDS control program, said that
the Jerusalem AIDS project aims to fight AIDS through education.
</P>
<P>
It has provided education materials about AIDS in a bid to
strengthen ties with Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Participants were sensitized on the role of education in
fighting AIDS, health education and sexuality and the aspect of
behavioral change, Nzabonakura said.
</P>
<P>
AIDS is one of the leading causes of death in Rwanda. The major
 constraints to HIV/AIDS control in Rwanda include stigma and
discrimination against people with AIDS. Illiteracy remains a
stumbling block to AIDS education.
</P>
<P>
More than 400,000 Rwandans are living with HIV and about
180,000 of them have developed AIDS.

CAIRO, April 3 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
pledged on Monday that France will cancel debts of the poorest
countries within one or two years.
</P>
<P>
Chirac made the pledge while addressing the first Africa-Europe
summit opened here earlier in the day. But he neither gave the

<HEADLINE> U.S. Judge Rules Microsoft Violates Antitrust Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- A federal judge found Monday
that Microsoft Corp. violated the Sherman Antitrust Act, "
maintained its monopoly power by anticompetitive means" and
attempted to monopolize the Web browser market.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson also ruled
that Microsoft violated another section of the law by "unlawfully
tying its Web browser to its operating system" and could be sued
under state anti-competition laws.
</P>
<P>
The judge accepted 23 of 26 arguments brought forth by the
states that joined the federal government in the case.
</P>
<P>
The judgment sets up a new round of hearings to determine what
punishment to impose on Microsoft, including the question of
whether the huge company founded by Bill Gates should be broken up.
</P>
<P>
"We are very pleased with the court's ruling," said Assistant
Attorney General Joel I. Klein. "The decision will benefit
consumers and stimulate competition and innovation in the high-
tech industry."
</P>
<P>
Throughout the trial, Jackson had strongly urged both sides in
the case to reach an out-of-court settlement. Those talks
collapsed over the weekend, however, prompting Jackson to issue
his ruling.
</P>
<P>
The judge's ruling had been expected to go against Microsoft
based on harsh assessments he outlined last November in his "
findings of fact." In that document, Jackson found that Microsoft
repeatedly engaged in anticompetitive behavior by taking advantage
of its monopoly power.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft stock was battered during the day, losing about 15
percent of its value.
</P>
<P>
In an interview in Monday's Wall Street Journal, Gates said
that regardless of what Jackson rules, his company will continue
to integrate the Internet into its Windows software, even though
that linkage is at the core of the Justice Department lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
"The ruling is just a step in the legal process. It doesn't
change any situation relative to what we do," he said.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft officials have said the company was "certainly"
prepared to appeal.
</P>
<P>
"We absolutely believe that the judicial system will ultimately
rule in our favor," Gates said.

NEW YORK, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The tech stocks fell sharply
Monday in advance of a judge's ruling in Microsoft's antitrust
case, dragging the technology heavy Nasdaq composite index down
about 350 points, the worst point drop in history.

</P>
<P>
Microsoft fell 16 1/4 to 90 U.S. dollars a share and brought
punishment to the Nasdaq index as a whole.

"Russia reiterates its position to counter any acts of
terrorism, by whoever and wherever perpetrated, and irrespective

suppressing in its territory the preparation and financing of

"Russia has some specific concern about what has been provided
in Article 15 of the Convention, namely with respect to the
possibility of refusing in certain conditions the extradition and
legal assistance given with regard to crimes defined in this
Convention," the press release said.

"Upon signing, Russia has therefore made a declaration to the
effect that the position of the Russian Federation is that the
provision of Article 15 of the Convention should be implemented in
such a way as to ensure the inevitability of punishment for the
commission of offenses falling within the scope of the Convention,
without detriment to the effectiveness of international
cooperation related to extradition and legal assistance," it added.

The Convention was adopted on December 9, 2000 by the General

the deposit of the 22nd instrument of ratification, acceptance,
approval or accession with the Secretary-General of the United
Nations.
