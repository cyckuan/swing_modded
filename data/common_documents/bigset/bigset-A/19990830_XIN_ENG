<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak said on Sunday that if Israeli and Palestinian negotiators
could not reach an agreement in hours, Israel would consider
implementing the Wye agreement in its way.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by the Prime Minister's office, Barak
said that at the conclusion of an additional meeting between his
envoy Gilad Sher and senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat,
"satisfactory answers have still not been received from the
Palestinian side."
</P>
<P>
Barak said that the two sides still differ on the timetable for
the implementation of the Wye agreement and on striking an
agreement over the framework for the final status talks within six
months.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Barak added, there is considerable disagreement
between the two sides on the issue of releasing Palestinian
prisoners jailed in Israeli prisons.
</P>
<P>
Barak noted that the number of the prisoners to be freed are
not being discussed at this stage.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that he has no intention what-so-ever to release
even one prisoner who belongs to the anti-Israel Hamas and Islamic
Jihad militant groups.
</P>
<P>
Barak also reiterated that none of the agreements, which have
been achieved until now on various issues in the negotiations,
would be implemented until all disagreements between the sides
were settled.
</P>
<P>
Barak made the comments just hours after he expressed hope
that Israel and the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) would
reach agreement this week.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the PNA signed the Wye agreement last October,
which called on Israel to hand over 13 percent of the West Bank
to the Palestinians, in exchange for tougher measures by the PNA
against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The issue of Palestinian prisoners remain the major block in
the current Israeli-Palestinian talks.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians demand that Israel release another 650
security prisoners, those jailed for anti-Israeli activities. But
Israel insists that it would release only 500 prisoners and would
not free those with "blood on their hands."

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Gets Tough on Fake Medicine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania is getting tough
on fake or substandard pharmaceuticals, mostly from India, in an
effort to safeguard people's health.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Health was registering all pharmaceuticals and
started to send full-time drug inspectors to all major ports in a
bid to curb the entry of fake or substandard ones, media reports
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Mariam Mwaffisi, permanent secretary in the ministry, said the
government wants to make sure that only medicine confirmed as
safe, efficacious and of acceptable quality is allowed to enter
the country.
</P>
<P>
The move comes after a number of medical practitioners and the
public complained that some imported drugs were ineffective. Most
complaints were directed at drugs made in India.
</P>
<P>
Mwaffisi said influx of fake pharmaceuticals has been an issue
of concern of the Pharmacy Board, a regulatory body overseeing
quality of drugs.
</P>
<P>
She said that a drug quality control laboratory is under
construction and may become operational before the end of this
year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the permanent secretary said the country is
reviewing the outdated Pharmaceutical and Poison Act to plug
loopholes of medicine imports.
</P>
<P>
She said the pharmacy board will also use internet facilities
to get information about drugs from international agencies and
other drug regulatory authorities.
</P>
<P>
The permanent secretary called on health providers and members
of the public to report any suspicious drug to the board. The war
against the importation, distribution and sale of fake drugs
cannot be won without the co-operation of the public, she noted.
</P>
<P>
The Indian High Commissioner to Tanzania, Virendra Gupta, said
earlier this week that drugs from India were used worldwide and
consumers need not worry about the manufacturing processes.
</P>
<P>
He said the United States purchases about 35 percent of Indian
made pharmaceutical products while European countries buy another
25 percent to 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
The high commissioner called for fight against unscrupulous
businessmen who are everywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
He called on Tanzania to license only reputable and
well-established foreign pharmaceutical companies that have
quality control measures certified by the World Health
Organization.
</P>
<P>
The private sector's involvement in the import of
pharmaceuticals started in 1986 after the liberalization of trade
in this sector. Previously, only the National Pharmaceutical
Company and the Central Medical Stores could import and distribute
pharmaceuticals.

<HEADLINE> Chronic Epilepsy Curable: Doctor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 29 (Xinhua) -- A Saudi surgeon specialized
in brain diseases said on Sunday that chronic epilepsy could be
cured by operations safely and successfully.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ashraf Ghabashi, a medicine professor at Saudi Ain Shams
University and a consultant of a Saudi private hospital, said the
great development in microscopic diagnoses and surgical methods
enhanced the chance of success of operations especially in cases
of epilepsy.
</P>
<P>
"The epileptic center point can be removed in a four-hour
operation," he told the Kuwait News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Ghabashi said the causes of epilepsy, one of the oldest and
most widely-spread nerve diseases, may differ on patients with
different ages, adding that epileptics under the age of 20
usually inherit the disease genetically, while people above 20
could get the disease in car accidents.
</P>
<P>
The doctor said that light and partial epilepsy shows such
symptoms as day dreaming, nausea, vomiting and inability to move
or talk while complete epilepsy is accompanied by spasms in all
part of the body, unconsciousness, involuntary urination and
saliva from the mouth.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of evaluating the patients'
cases because the disease can be controlled initially with
medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
Surgical operation could only be an option after three years
of medical treatment fails to control the disease, he noted.
</P>
<P>
On the procedure to evaluate the patient for surgery,
Ghabashi said that it needs a CT scan of the brain after
stopping medical treatment, which can help diagnose the cause of
the disease.
</P>
<P>
He said the best chance to remove the source of the disease is
when the affected nerves are positioned on either the front part
of the brain or at temporal part, where the success rate is
between 80 percent and 85 percent.
</P>
<P>
But the doctor added that if the source of epilepsy is spread
around the brain, an operation to split the right and left parts
of the brain is needed.
</P>
<P>
He recommended that epileptics continue to take medicine for
one year after the operation.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Work with IAEA on 12 Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Iran said on Sunday it will
cooperate with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on
implementing 12 projects by the end of the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Khalil Mousavi, spokesman with Iran's Atomic Energy
Organization (IAEO), said these projects include brachytherapy,
radioisotopes production, radium treatment for pests and plant
disease control and water quality study.
</P>
<P>
The projects will cost 1.54 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Iran has declared time and again that its nuclear research is
for peaceful purposes and subject to international supervision,
denying U.S. and Israeli accusations that Tehran is seeking
nuclear weapon capability.
</P>
<P>
The joint projects with IAEA showed Tehran is making headway in
its pursuit of peaceful use of nuclear energy, despite
U.S. opposition and containment.
</P>
<P>
Iran's first nuclear power plant at Bushehr on the Gulf coast
is in full swing, and major parameters in design as well as
studies on environment and proneness to earthquake have been
worked out in accordance with international standards.
</P>
<P>
Russia is helping Iran build a 1,000-megawatt light-water
reactor at Bushehr. It was reported that Iran has proposed that
Moscow help build three more nuclear reactors at Bushehr, which
would cost between 3 billion and 4.5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Germans began working on the Bushehr project in
1974. Construction was later halted and the plant was damaged in
the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war. Work was resumed only in October 1998.
</P>
<P>
The nuclear power plant is scheduled to be completed and go
into operation in May 2003.
</P>
<P>
Mousavi said concrete containment construction work, steel
dome, water intake drainage, repair of infrastructural
installations at workshops, machinery and technical documents
needed by the plant, have been completed and other executive
operations are going ahead on schedule.
</P>
<P>
He said other work done last year include exploration and
identification of radioactive sources at a metallurgical belt,
preparation of maps for exploring uranium, and determination of
five new exploration zones.
</P>
<P>
IAEO's Radioactive Waste Management Department has collected
360 cubic meters of solid nuclear wastes and 1,680 cubic meters
of liquid wastes from medical centers, he added.

SEVILLE, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The International Amateur Athletics
Federation (IAAF) President Primo Nebiolo said here on Sunday that Paris,
Lond, Tokyo and Berlin would be in line to host the world championships
from the year 2003 to 2009.
</P>
<P>
Next world championships will be hosted by Edmonton, Canada. The site
was decided last year.
</P>
<P>
A final decision on the venues until 2009 is expected to be made next
year. But Nebiolo told reporters: "we have a project to award four world
championships through 2009. The cities have accepted the idea."
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the closing day of the Seville World Championships,
Nebiolo said the biennial event would be held in Paris in 2003, London in
2005, Tokyo in 2007 and Berlin in 2009.
</P>
<P>
Nebiolo added that IAAF hoped to include London to the sport's elite
"Golden League" circuit next year and Doha, Qatar, might hold the 2000
Grand Prix Final.
</P>
<P>
"London is London," said the president. "Now they don't have the
appropriate stadium. But we are confident Crystal Palace can be good for
the first meeting."
</P>
<P>
He said that after the completion of the Wembley Stadium, subsequent
Golden League meets and the 2005 World Championships should be held at
the state-of-the-art venue.

<HEADLINE> Abducted Tourists Likely to Be Freed by Weekend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Four foreign tourists kidnapped
two weeks ago in Iran's southeastern province of Kerman are
expected to be freed by the weekend, a local official said on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted Kerman
province's deputy governor general Mohammad-Ali Karimi as saying
that local authorities have done "all within their power to secure
the release of the hostages."
</P>
<P>
Negotiations with abductors are still underway for the release
of three Spaniards and one Italian and their Iranian guide.
</P>
<P>
They were taken hostage in a hotel August 14 by three men and
two women linked to drug trafficking. Another provincial official
was quoted by a local newspaper as saying all the hostages are in
good condition.
</P>
<P>
One of the hostages, an old Spanish priest, had been
reportedly sick but is now recovering, said the official.
</P>
<P>
The kidnappers and their captives are "entirely surrounded by
Iranian security forces" and negotiations are heading for
"positive direction," the official added.
</P>
<P>
Karimi explained that drug traffickers resorted to kidnapping
because they were hit hard in the drastic anti-narcotics
campaign. The abductors reportedly want to exchange their captives
with their partners held by the government.
</P>
<P>
The government, eager to draw foreign tourists as well as
investments, is seeking the safe return of the foreigners, in
order to "prevent any harm to the tourism industry in the
country and to the prestige of Iran at large."

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Fighter Wounded in Israeli Air Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's anti-Israeli guerrilla
group Hezbollah said late Sunday that one of its members was
wounded in Israeli air raids on a village in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Voice of the People radio quoted the group's official
sources as saying that the Hezbollah fighter was wounded when
Israeli warplanes pounded the environs of Kafar village in the
central sector of the Israeli occupied border zone in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The sources denied Israeli radio's reports that one Hezbollah
guerrilla was killed and three others were wounded during the
Israeli air blast.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, six Lebanese civilians were wounded in
Israeli shelling on several villages in the south.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli attacks followed a series of offensives launched
by Hezbollah and the country's another active Muslim group Amal on
the Israeli outposts inside the occupied zone. There have been no
immediate reports about casualties from the attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since the start of this year, a total of 18 Lebanese civilians
have been killed and more than 100 others wounded in clashes
between Israeli troops and Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting to
oust Israeli troops out of the country.

<HEADLINE> 6 Lebanese Civilians Wounded in Israeli Shellings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Six Lebanese civilians were
wounded Sunday in Israeli shellings of several villages in south
Lebanon, Lebanese security sources said.
</P>
<P>
Two Lebanese civilians were injured in Israel's separate
shellings on the villages of Kafar and Kafar Tibnit in the central
sector of the Israeli occupied border zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, a couple and their child and another
villager were wounded when shells landed on the residential
district of the Mansuri village, north of the occupied border
zone.
</P>
<P>
Following the incident, the injured were sent to a hospital in
the nearby port city of Tyre, the sources said, adding the
shelling also damaged several houses in the village.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli bombardment followed a series of offensives
launched by Lebanon's Muslim Shiite group Amal on the Israeli
outposts inside the occupied zone.
</P>
<P>
There have been no immediate reports about casualties from the
attack.
</P>
<P>
Since the start of this year, a total of 18 Lebanese civilians
have been killed and more than 100 others wounded in clashes
between Israeli troops and Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting to
oust Israeli troops out of the country.

LAGOS, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations World Food
Program (WFP) has started distributing food to people in northern

The WFP said that 18,000 civilians had fled to towns in the
Zorzor district, about 220 kilometers northeast of the west
Africa state's capital Monrovia. It said that another 7,000 people
took refuge in villages near where the fighting took place.

food they had when they ran from their homes, said Felix Gomez,
Liberian representative of the WFP, on Saturday.

Division Soccer League in Fushun, Liaoning province on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Calls for Syrian-Palestinian Reconciliation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa Sunday called on Syria and the Palestinians to iron out
their differences as it is "in the interests of Arabs."
</P>
<P>
Syria and the Palestinian National Authority should put their
differences behind them in an effort to strengthen the interests
of all Arabs, Moussa told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Syrian troops fought Palestinian guerrillas in Lebanon in the
1980s, and Syrian President Hafez al-Assad has never forgiven
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat for negotiating a separate peace
accord secretly with Israel in 1993.
</P>
<P>
"It is time to end the Syrian-Palestinian dispute," Moussa was
quoted by Egypt's Middle East News Agency as saying. "We hope that
relations of understanding will be restored because that is in the
interests of all Arabs," Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Syria and the Palestinian leadership have
worsened since Arafat signed the 1993 Oslo Accord with Israel.
</P>
<P>
During a speech in Lebanon last month, Syrian Defense Minister
Mustafa Tlass condemned Arafat for making concessions to Israel.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who personally played down the insults that his aides
harshly condemned, is believed to be interested in better
relations with Syria out of concern that Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak might focus on making peace with Syria. That could
leave the Palestinian peace track on the back burner.
</P>
<P>
Moussa's remarks came at a time when Egypt is trying to
organize an Arab summit that Cairo believes is necessary to forge
an Arab strategy before the final stage of peace negotiations
between the Palestinians and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Egypt maintains good relations with Syria and the Palestinians,
though Egyptian officials have been angered by Syria's snub to
their call for an Arab summit in Cairo.

<HEADLINE> UAE Proud of Hosting Joint Meetings of WB and IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)
plays a very important role in the world affairs, as reflected by
the fact that the country has been chosen to host an important
world conference, said a senior UAE official Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The selection of the UAE as the venue for the 2003 joint
meetings of the World Bank (WB) and the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) underlined the prominent position occupied by the UAE
in the world affairs and its constructive effort to stimulate
regional and global economic cooperation," said Dr. Mohammed
Khalfan Bin Kharbash, UAE Minister of State for Financial and
Industrial Affairs at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The selection of Dubai to host the week-long meetings was made
on Thursday in a vote by the board of the WB and IMF executive
managers in Washington.
</P>
<P>
And the decision will be tabled to the Board of Governors of
the WB and IMF for approval before the end of September.
</P>
<P>
Khirbash indicated that the UAE's aid to friendly countries,
totaling about 97 billion dirhams (about 26.5 billion
U.S. dollars) at the end of 1998, contributed to the choosing of
it as the venue of the 2003 conference.
</P>
<P>
With its oil wealth, the UAE has always aspired to play an
important role in the world arena, mainly through financial aid to
poor countries and participation in some world and regional
activities, such as sending peacekeeping troops to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The UAE is the first country in the Middle East to host such a
conference, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The 2000 WB and IMF conference will be held in the Czech
republic, while the 2001 and 2002 conferences will be held in
Washington.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Supreme Court Rejects Appeal by Rabin's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli Supreme Court
Sunday rejected an appeal by Yitzhak Rabin's assassin against the
convictions he got together with his brother and a friend for
conspiring to murder the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
In a trial three years ago, Yigal Amir, an extreme right-wing
religious Jew, was sentenced to life imprisonment for the
assassination.
</P>
<P>
Amir had also got a separate, five-year sentence for
conspiracy to commit the murder and for plotting attacks against
Arabs.
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's judgement, the Supreme Court also accepted a
prosecution plea to toughen the punishment for Amir and his
brother.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Courty added three years to Amir's five-year
sentence, and increased the sentence of his brother Hagai from
12 to 16 years for the charge.
</P>
<P>
A seven-year sentence against another co-conspirator Dror
Adani, was not changed.
</P>
<P>
Amir fired three bullets into Rabin as he left a peace
rally in Tel Aviv on November 4, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Amir said that he murdered Rabin in order to put an end
to Rabin's peace-making policies with the Palestinians.

MAPUTO, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican government intends
to revive mobile cinema as a way to bring information and
entertainment to rural areas.
</P>
<P>
According to Jose Pereira, spokesman for the Ministry of
Culture, Youth and Sport, the government will encourage private
operators interested in promoting mobile cinema to invest in the
field, so that a variety of cultural and civic activities can
reach areas where there are no televisions or video sets.
</P>
<P>
"Since there are very few conventional cinemas, and since most
of the population lives in the countryside where, in the short
term, conventional cinemas will not be established, mobile cinema
should be the government's priority", he said.

<HEADLINE> N.Ireland's Unionist Leader Gloomy about Review Chances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's Ulster
Unionist Party leader David Trimble said on Saturday that the
chances for a breakthrough in the stalled peace process were slim
after IRA death threats against four Catholic teenagers.
</P>
<P>
The threats were made after Britain's Northern Ireland
Secretary Mo Mowlam ruled that the Irish Republican Army had not
violated the province's ceasefire despite evidence it was involved
in a murder and gun-running.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think (Mowlam) realizes the tremendous damage she has
done," Trimble told BBC radio.
</P>
<P>
Former U.S. senator George Mitchell, who helped mediate the
Good Friday deal, is due to return on September 6 as chairman of a
review designed to overcome problems between the unionists and the
IRA's political wing, Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
The UUP is due to meet on Tuesday, and debate its position on
the review.
</P>
<P>
Trimble claimed Mowlam's decision led directly to death threats
against four Catholic teenagers who have fled Northern Ireland,
and are said to be in London.

<HEADLINE> 160 Million-Year Old Dinosaur Fossils Found in Guizhou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists in
southwest China's Guizhou Province have found 100 fossilized
pieces of a ten-meter long dinosaur dating back 160 million years.
</P>
<P>
The fossils were discovered in a terrain three meters
underground in Pingba County, said Cai Huiyang, a local
archaeologist. The largest piece, from the dinosaur's head, is
about 50 cm long and 30 cm high. Mandible teeth and the eye socket
can be easily identified.
</P>
<P>
The province lies on a land which was under sea 200 million
years ago before a geographic shift. The area is rich in fossils
of plants and animals.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the fossils of an eight-meter long dinosaur were
found in Xifeng County, 100 km from Pingba County, Cai said.
</P>
<P>
Fossils which are unearthed in Guizhou usually belong to
dinosaurs that inhabited water; the fossils in Pingba are the
first of their kind ever found in the province which belong to a
land dinosaur, he said.
</P>
<P>
The find will provide valuable clues to the study of ancient
biology, geography and climate changes in the region, he added.

BRUSSELS, August 29 (Xinhua) -- David Coulthard of Britain

the day's race.
</P>
<P>
Hakkinen from Finland came in runners-up in another McLaren car
with a time of one hour 25 minutes 53.51 seconds, followed by

<HEADLINE> 3 Dead, Hundreds Injured in S.Africa's Freak Storm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 29 (Xinhua) -- At least three people were
killed, more than 110 injured and 2,000 left homeless after a
freak storm -- described by some as a tornado -- struck the Cape
Peninsula Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
The storm had cut a one kilometer swath from the Atlantic
seaboard through the peninsula, South African Press Association
(SAPA) quoted Cape Town's civil protection chief Mike Marsden as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The storm's epicenter was in the high-density area of Manenberg
on the Cape Flats where most of the damage occurred.
</P>
<P>
Marsden said he did not know "the exact nature of the
meteorological phenomenon", but whatever it was "it had caused a
swath of destruction".
</P>
<P>
Police confirmed three dead by mid afternoon, including two
women aged 50 and 42, SAPA said. However, there were unconfirmed
reports of at least eight dead.
</P>
<P>
Families who escaped the worst of the storm were told to leave
the area for their own safety as rescue workers feared more
buildings might collapse.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers tried to clear the streets of curious onlookers. They
had been called in to patrol the area to deter looters and
thieves.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Congress Staffers Arrive in Baghdad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 29 (Xinhua) -- An eight-member delegation of
U.S. congressional aides arrived in Baghdad on Sunday evening to
investigate the effect of U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq for over
nine years.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that a U.S. congressional delegation
visits Iraq after the country was put under U.N. economic
sanctions following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. delegation is reportedly to "examine the effect of
economic sanctions in Iraq on the civilian population, Iraqi
government policy and U.S. economic and strategic interests,
including the possibility of resuming U.S. grain sales to Iraq."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. congressional staff members will also probe into the
effects of depleted uranium, and the health hazards suffered by
U.S. veterans and Iraqi civilians, as well as the escalating
U.S. bombing campaign against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has blamed the U.N. sanctions for the deaths of hundreds
of thousands of Iraqis through malnutrition and the collapse of
the country's medical services.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey conducted by the United Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF) found that child mortality rates have more than
doubled in south and central Iraq since the sanctions were
imposed on the country in 1990.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF officials have estimated that some 5,000 to 6,000 Iraqi
children under the age of five die each month due to malnutrition
and various curable diseases.

<HEADLINE> Macedonia Protests NATO for Killing Macedonian Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The Macedonian Ministry of
Foreign Affairs Sunday sent a letter to the Liaison Office of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in Macedonia, strongly
protesting a NATO vehicle's involvement in killing a Macedonian
government minister.
</P>
<P>
Macedonia's Minister without Portfolio Radovan Stojkovski's
"Audi" car Saturday suffered a head-on clash with a KFOR "Toyota"
van on a Skopie-Veles highway. Stojkoivski and his wife and
daughter were instantly killed in the accident, while his son and
the driver were injured.
</P>
<P>
The Macedonian Interior Ministry said that the KFOR's van was
moving in direction contrary to the traffic regulations
</P>
<P>
Some KFOR (Kosovo peacekeeping forces) servicemen also not
cooperate after the accident, trying to stop officers of the
Macedonian Interior Ministry from investigating the accident spot,
the ministry was quoted as saying by the Macedonian Information
Agency.
</P>
<P>
This behavior violated the basic agreement between Macedonia
and NATO concerning NATO mission operation in Macedonia, the
ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry required full cooperation of NATO for solving the
accident, demanding the protest letter to be sent to the KFOR
command.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ministry also urged all NATO servicemen in
Macedonia to obey the country's laws.

<HEADLINE> World Athletics Championships End on High Note </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEVILLE, August 29 (Xinhua) -- If anyone expects some surprises
from athletics, the competitions on the closing day of the 7th
World Athletics Championships may well meet the needs.
</P>
<P>
After Jong Song-Ok of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
emerged from an unknown situation to defeat such big names as
Olympic champion Fatuma Roba of Ethiopia to win the women's
marathon in the morning, the Bahamas women's relay team defeated
the United States to take back home the 4x100 meter relay in the
evening.
</P>
<P>
Jong Song-Ok, at the age of 25, moved ahead in the final two
kilometers and beat her personal best with two hours 26 minutes
and 59 seconds for the gold, the second one for Asia at the
championships.
</P>
<P>
It is also the first medal of any color for DPR Korea at the
world championships since its inauguration in 1983.
</P>
<P>
Japanese runner Ari Ichihashi, who led the race for most of the
time, was second at 2:27:02, also a personal best. Romanian Lidia
Simon finished third at 2:27:41.
</P>
<P>
Roba broke away from a leading group of four featuring the
eventual medal winners with some eight kilometers remaining but
she was soon caught and ended fourth.
</P>
<P>
The Bahamas quarttet, with Sevatheda Fynes running the first
leg, produced the day's biggest surprise with the gold in the
women's 4x100m relay at a time of 41.92 seconds, the first title
for the country in this event in history of the world
championships.
</P>
<P>
France was second at 42.06 and Jamaica finished third at 42.15.
</P>
<P>
With absence of women's 100m world champion Marion Jones, the
American team, gold medal winner in Goteborg '95 and Athens '97,
had a lacklustre performance in the relay event, finishing a
disappointed fourth place.
</P>
<P>
The American runners, including world champions Inger Miller
and Gail Devers, only managed to clock 42.30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
The Ameircan team tried to make a change of its bad luck in the
women's 4x400m relay, however, they missed once again the fortune
in the race, in which the Russian four-some won the gold with a
clocking of three minutes 21.98 seconds.
</P>
<P>
The Americans were second at 3:22.09 and Germany had the bronze
at 3:22.43.
</P>
<P>
When the American women runners failed to make in Seville,
their male counterparts proved their dominating power in the both
relay events, winning the 4x100m and 4x400m with ease.
</P>
<P>
The American men's team, led by sprint double winner Maurice
Greene, were timed 37.59 seconds to take the crown, the fifth
fastest time in history.
</P>
<P>
Britain was second at 37.73 and Nigeria third at 37.91.
</P>
<P>
With the win, Greene, who had won 100- and 200 meters golds in
championships history, is the only one in Seville to return home
with three golds.
</P>
<P>
While in the 4x400m event, the American team, with 400m world
champion Michael Johnson running the calibre, were clocked two
minutes and 56.45 seconds for the crown.
</P>
<P>
Poland, who had been chasing the American rivals from the start,
were second at 2:58.91 and Jamaica third at 2:59.34.
</P>
<P>
Denmark and Finland had successful attacks to the golds on the
final day through Wilson Kipketer and Aki Parviainen in the men's
800m and javelin throw respectively.
</P>
<P>
The Great Dane Kipketer won his third consecutive title with a
performance of one minute 43.11 seconds in a thrilling final 50
meters finish.
</P>
<P>
The world record holder beat the South African Hezekiel Sepen
two hundredths of a second, in a final face to face only solved at
the finish line. The third placing went to newcomer Algerian
Djabir Said-Guerni, with 1:44.18.
</P>
<P>
While in the men's javelin throw, '99 world leader Parviainen
won the gold for Finland with a throw of 89.52 on his fifth
attempt.
</P>
<P>
The silver medal was taken by Kostas Gatsioudis of Greece, the
1997 bronze medallist, with a first round throw of 89.18.
</P>
<P>
Czech world record holder Jan Zelezny, the 1993 and 1995 world
champion as well as the 1992 and 1996 Olympic champion,had to
settle for third on this occasion with a second round 87.67.
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian Inga Babakova won the women's hight jump with a
clearance of 1.99 meters, the height she failed to clear costed
her gold medal chance two years ago in Athens.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian, the silver medal winner in 1997 and bronze
medlist in 1991 and 1995, made no such mistake here to win her
first major international title. She won by the narrowest of
margins, thanks to her faultless record throughout the competition
until the height was raised to 2.01.
</P>
<P>
None of the three women who went over 1.99 could clear the
following height and the 32-year-old became the world champion on
the basis of fewer failures.
</P>
<P>
Russian Yelena Yelesina cleared 1.99 on her second attempt but
the failure meant she was awarded the silver medal in her first
world championship appearence since 1991 when she also finished
second.
</P>
<P>
Yelesina's 21-year-old compatriot Svetlana Lapina was an
ecstatic bronze medallist with her personal best clearance at 1.99.
</P>
<P>
Svetlana Masterkova of Russia, who had a disappointing running
in the women's 800m race with a bronze medal, won the women's
1500m gold medal on the final day.
</P>
<P>
The Russian, 30, was clocked three minutes 59.53 seconds for
the title.
</P>
<P>
Regina Jacobs of the United States was second at 4:00.35 and
Kutre Dulecha of Ethiopia third at 4:00.96.
</P>
<P>
After nine-day competitions in running, jumping and throwing,
the United States led the medal table with 11 golds with Russia
chasing behind at 6.

<HEADLINE> Updated: Treasury Bonds Increase To Spur Chinese Economy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The Standing Committee of the
Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), China's top legislature,
today ratified a State Council bill to issue 60 billion yuan (7.2
billion U.S. dollars) in treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
Half of the bonds will be included in the country's budget this
year, raising the financial deficit to 180.3 billion yuan (21.7
billion dollars) from the 150.3 billion yuan (18.1 billion dollars)
recorded early this year.
</P>
<P>
The newly-added bonds, following 100 billion yuan in bonds
issued last year, are expected to stimulate the sluggish economy
by moving investment into fixed assets.
</P>
<P>
"The bonds should help complete ongoing construction of large
projects, promote technical renovation in enterprises, help expand
exports, increase job opportunities, and maintain social stability,
" states the resolution submitted to the 11th session of the Ninth
NPC Standing Committee for approval. The session closed today.
</P>
<P>
The long-term bonds will be used mainly for infrastructure
projects, technical renovation in key industries, manufacture of
equipment for major projects, as well as environmental protection
and scientific research programs.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Xiang Huaicheng defended the move as " an
urgent and irreplaceable measure to combat present economic
difficulties."
</P>
<P>
The issuing of 100 billion yuan of bonds last year proved to be
successful in boosting the domestic economy, said Xiang, who cited
statistics showing that the measure has contributed 1.5 percentage

<HEADLINE> East Timor's Autonomy Ballot Takes Place Fairly: U.N. Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DILI, August 30 (Xinhua) -- East Timorese Monday gave their
votes at polling stations freely, fairly and secretly, said
Jamsheed Marker, the United Nations secretary general's special
envoy for East Timor.
</P>
<P>
After observing the autonomy ballot, Marker told reporters here
Monday that the ballot was successfully held due to peaceful
enthusiasm in the conduct of the vote.
</P>
<P>
He conveyed the warm congratulations from U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan to the East Timorese for the successfully held
autonomy ballot.
</P>
<P>
More than 450,000 East Timorese within and outside Indonesia
Monday cast their ballots on Indonesia's offer to remain within
its fold as a special autonomous province. If they reject
Indonesia's offer, East Timor would eventually become an
independent state.
</P>
<P>
The East Timorese Pro-Integration Joint Front (UNIF) spokesman
Basilio Dias Araujo told a press conference here that UNIF
recorded at least 37 violations during the ballot.
</P>
<P>
Most of the violations were committed by personnel of the U.N.
Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) who allegedly compelled voters to
choose independence over autonomy, he said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Minister of Justice and State Secretary Muladi told
reporters in Jakarta that polling in East Timor must be repeated
if UNAMET staff are proven guilty of intimidating voters to cast
for certain group.
</P>
<P>
UNAMET spokesman David Wimhurst said the vote count will be
centralized in Dili and the results would be announced one week
after the ballot.
</P>
<P>
The former Portuguese colony of East Timor was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976 in a move never recognized by the U.N., which
still considers Portugal as the administering power of the
territory.

<HEADLINE> U.S. New-Home Sales Rise Slightly in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. sales of new homes in
July increased just 0.1 percent following a hefty 7.3 percent gain
in June, The Commerce Department said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Department reported that sales of new single-family homes
rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 980,000 units last
month, up from a June sales pace of 979,000 units.
</P>
<P>
Sales were up in all parts of the country except the West.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said July's performance was better than they
expected. They said an increase in sales would occur as buyers
rush to beat slowly rising mortgage rates.
</P>
<P>
The monthly average for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage in July
was 7.63 percent, up from 7.55 percent in June and 6.95 percent in
July of 1998. In August, the rate on a 30-year mortgage spiked up
to 8.15 percent, setting a high for the year.
</P>
<P>
A report last week showed that rising mortgage rates took a
bite out of existing home sales, which fell by 3.9 percent in
July. Still, existing home sales still managed to post the
third-best month ever.
</P>
<P>
The sales level for July was the highest since 985,000 new
homes were sold in November 1998.
</P>
<P>
The median price for a new home was 156,000 dollars, up from
June's median price of 155,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The average price for a home sold in July, however, was 186,000
dollars, down from 190,700 dollars in June.
</P>
<P>
The increase in sales meant that it would take 3.8 months to
exhaust the existing supply of unsold homes at the July sales
pace. That was the same unsold inventory as in June.

<HEADLINE> Hu Jintao Meets Lao Guests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Hu Jintao, member of the
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), met with
Thongsing Thammavong, member of the Political Bureau and head of
the Central Organization Department of Lao People's Revolutionary
Party (LPRP), and his party here this afternoon at the Great Hall
of the People.
</P>
<P>
Hu, who is also Chinese Vice-President, said that China and
Laos are friendly neighbors sharing common mountains and rivers,
and the two peoples have a long history of friendship. Thanks to
the care and concern of high-level leaders of the two countries,
he said, the Sino-Lao relationship developed well, with frequent
exchanges and enhanced cooperation in all fields.
</P>
<P>
Hu pointed out that both CPC and LPRP are their country's
ruling parties, adhere to the socialist system and the reform and
opening-up, and face similar problems and challenges.
"Under the new situation and with new tasks, China and Laos should
enhance party-to-party and state-to-state friendly and cooperative
relations, learn from the other and support the other," Hu said.
</P>
<P>
In his opinion, the enhancement of bilateral ties is the common
goal of the two countries, and an even closer bilateral
relationship will promote the self-development of the two parties
as well as the cause of socialism.
</P>
<P>
"CPC is willing to make concerted efforts with LPRP for the
development of a long-term, stable and mutually trustworthy Sino-
Lao relationship that benefits both sides," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Thongsing noted that China has had success with its reform and
opening-up drive with its own characteristics and people's lives
have improved in spite of a complicated international situation,
he said, adding that such an accomplishment is "an encouragement"
to his party and the Lao people.
</P>
<P>
He also hoped that his visit would further promote mutual
understanding and cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Hu briefed the Lao guests on party construction work of the CPC
and China's views on the international situation.
</P>
<P>
Thongsing and his party came to China as guests of the CPC.

<HEADLINE> Updated: Treasury Bonds Increase To Spur Chinese Economy (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"However, the effect brought about by the treasury bonds last
year is being weakened by declines in exports and foreign
investment, slack consumption, a slow increase of fixed-assets
investment and the continued downfall of prices since last March,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Xiang would not deny the possible debt-payment pressures on the
Central Government, but argued that the overall economic situation
would get worse if strong measures were not taken immediately.
</P>
<P>
"We may face greater difficulties in the reform and development
of state-owned enterprises, have more laid-off workers, and be
further confronted by financial risks," he warned.
</P>
<P>
The minister assured the NPC Standing Committee members the
feasibility of issuing the bonds. He said redundant money
deposited in banks can be turned into efficient investment, and
the waste of bonds in blind, repetitive and shoddy projects can be
largely prevented since experience in using bonds in
infrastructure construction has been accumulated.
</P>
<P>
Xiang stressed that the bonds will be channeled with more
consideration given to large-scale projects which are under
construction, technologically-outdated state-owned enterprises,
and the central and western regions.
</P>
<P>
"Taxation policy will be tightened and the fight against tax
evasion will be enhanced to increase revenues," he added.

WUHAN, CHINA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Li Feng-Ying of Chinese
Taipei set a new world record of 121.0kg in clean and jerk of the
women's 53kg category at the Asian Weightlifting Championships
here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Li Feng-Ying'added 0.5kg, a minimum official margin for a new
world mark, into the listed weight set by Chinese lifter Meng
Xianjuan in Chiba, Japan, last May.
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old Li also snatched 95kg for a winning total of
215kg.
</P>
<P>
"That results were my personal-best. I had never thought of
breaking a world record," said the delighted Li.
</P>
<P>
"I'm the mother of a two-year-old girl, so the victory to me is
an expected reward to my hard training." she added.
</P>
<P>
Championships favorite Wang Xiufen of China injured her arm in
the snatch and had to settle for the second place with a snatch of
92.5kg, a clean and jerk of 120.0kg and a total of 212.5kg.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Hercules Shi Zhiyong, men's 63kg class world record
holder in the snatch with 150.0kg, attempted to snatch 150.5kg but
failed to break his own record with 147.5kg.
</P>

5kg but tumbled down, won the jerk event with 175.0kg. And Shi
Zhiyong finished in the second with 172.5kg.
</P>
<P>
"Our lifters were in their best forms and should have broke the
world records. Their failure meant they still need to improve
their skills." said Yang Hanxiong, head coach of Chinese national
team.
</P>
<P>
"But Shi Zhiyong was optimistic because he made progress in the
jerk and total which gave him great confidence fro a record
attempt at the World Championships in Athens, Greece, in November,

<P>
NEW YORK, August 30 (Xinhua) -- AT&AMP;T Corp. offered Monday to
cut prices for long-distance phone calls in response to a price
war.
</P>
<P>
The rate cutting was announced by AT&AMP;T chairman Mike Armstrong
in a teleconference call three weeks after MCI WorldCom cut its
rates.
</P>
<P>
Armstrong said the U.S. largest long-distance company will cut
the price to 7 cents a minute plus a monthly fee of 5.95 U.S.
dollars. The price is still higher than the rate offered by MCI
but the AT&AMP;T's new rate is good for calls made any time of the
day.
</P>
<P>
MCI cut its rate to five cents a minute all weekend and from 7
p.m. to 7 a.m. five days a week for a 1.95 dollar monthly fee
while Sprint Corp. has a similar five-cent plan for nighttime
calling. But the MCI plan charges as much as 25 cents per minute
if calls are made during daytime hours.
</P>
<P>
AT&AMP;T hopes its easy-to-use plan will stem customer defections.
</P>
<P>
AT&AMP;T had charged 15 cents a minute around the clock with no
monthly fee or 10 cents a minute with a 4.95 dollar fee per month.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said Monday during a meeting with visiting Ecuadorian President
Jamil Mahuad Witt that China vigorously supports the development
of economic and trade relations in addition to the overall
friendly ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said during the 90-minute meeting that China welcomes
Ecuadorian entrepreneurs to explore business opportunities and
market potential in the country and encourages Chinese firms to
invest in Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that, through joint efforts, bilateral economic and
trade relations will grow to new highs," he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Jiang said that China is satisfied with the
current development of bilateral friendly relations and
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
China-Ecuador relations have been growing smoothly since the
two countries established diplomatic ties in 1980, Jiang noted.
The friendly ties have been deepened and widened over the past
several years due to more exchanges of high-level visits and the
increased understanding between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
"At the turn of the century, which marks the 20th anniversary
of the Sino-Ecuadorian relationship, we are ready to make concrete
efforts together with the Ecuadorian side to build an all-round,
stable and long-term friendly relations and cooperation between
our two sides," Jiang said.

</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed appreciation for the Ecuadorian stand. He added
that China will continue to strengthen unity and cooperation with
the developing nations across the world and defend their common
legitimate rights and interests.
</P>
<P>
The world today is heading towards multi-polarization, Jiang
said, and the globalization of world economy has created both
challenges and opportunities for the developing nations.
</P>
<P>
Given that, Jiang said, China insists that a just and
reasonable new world order in the political and economic areas
should be established under the five principles of peaceful

<HEADLINE> Scores Injured in Bangladeshi Opposition Procession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Scores of people were injured in
the Bangladeshi capital city Monday during the
opposition-sponsored procession protesting the government's "bid
to award India corridor in the name of transshipment."
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the Dainik Janakantha, a Bengali newspaper, was
attacked during the procession, injuring four people, including a
worker for the paper.
</P>
<P>
Police fired shots and tear gas to disperse procession
activists who exploded home-made bombs and hurled bricks at the
police, they said.
</P>
<P>
One vehicle was set on fire and many others were damaged.
</P>
<P>
The opposition alliance, comprising the Bangladesh Nationalist
Party, the Jatiya Party, the Jamaat-e-Islami and the Islami Oikya
Jote, renewed their vow to resist the government move to give
transshipment service to India.
</P>
<P>
The opposition also boycotted the 14th session of the 7th
parliament, which started Sunday, to press for cancellation of the
cabinet's decision in late July to examine the proposal of
providing transshipment facility to India.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a huge rally prior to a big procession in the city
marking the opposition's "demonstration day" in the afternoon,
Chairperson of the major opposition BNP and leader of the
opposition in parliament Begum Khaleda Zia called upon the people
to join the sit-in program in front of the secretariat on
September 12, to "resist the bid to award India corridor in the
name of transshipment."
</P>
<P>
She criticized the reported attack by the Border Security
Forces of India on the innocent villagers along the border areas,
the government's eviction of the slum dwellers and the storming of
the board meeting of the United Commercial Bank Limited, a private
bank, by a group led by a ruling party leader.
</P>
<P>
She urged the people to participate in all anti-government
programs to "end the rule of the 'fascists'."
</P>
<P>
At a separate pre-procession rally, Jatiya Party Chairman and
former president H.M. Ershad also urged the people to resist any
move of the government to provide transshipment or transit
facility to India. "Mills and factories of the country would face
closure as Indian goods will dominate the local market if the
transit is given to India," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Independence and sovereignty of the country would be
threatened if the facility is provided to India," he noted,
demanding resignation of the government and early elections under
a neutral caretaker government.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: China Takes Resolute Measures for Stimulating Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislature today
adopted amendments to the Law on Personal Income Tax and a bill on
issuing 60 billion yuan-worth of treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
Economic experts and members of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress (NPC) believed that the action will
help to stimulate consumer activity and domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
Chen Guangyi, chairman of the Financial and Economic Committee
of the NPC, said the lack of consumer demand is the major problem
facing the economy, and the government is creating financial
policies to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
He said the levying of the savings deposit interest tax is
meant to ensure a minimum income level for urban residents. Its
function is similar to that of the additional treasury bonds for
infrastructure building. The two acts will not only ease current
economic woes, but also can help solve many long-term social and
economic problems.
</P>
<P>
He said the adoption of the amendments and the bill will have a
profound impact on the country's economic growth and social
stability.
</P>
<P>
Ordinary residents have calmly accepted the successive slashing
of deposit interest rates by the central bank on seven occasions
since 1996. The one-year fixed deposit interest rate was cut from
9.16 percent in 1996 to the present 2.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
A sample survey made in Beijing, Tianjin and Shanghai in the
first half of this year indicated that 53.7 percent of the
respondents supported the deposit interest tax.
</P>
<P>
Economic experts from the NPC Standing Committee believe that
the successive issuing of additional treasury bonds will increase
the central financial budget deficit from 150.3 billion yuan to
180.3 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
According to the internationally accepted calculation method,
the deficit has not exceeded the danger zone and is acceptable.
</P>
<P>
The NPC Standing Committee granted the additional issuing of
100 billion yuan-worth of treasury bonds last year, triggering
economic growth of about 1.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
The gross domestic product of the first half of this year is up
7.6 percent over last year's same period.

<HEADLINE> New Procedure for Closed-End Loans to Foreign Trade Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China (PBOC)
and four other state departments jointly issued a provisional
procedure today on the management of closed-end loans to foreign
trade companies, aiming to give more support to the country's
export sector.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the PBOC said that the move is meant to promote
the development of foreign trade companies, rejuvenate credit
assets of banks, reinforce cooperation between banks and
enterprises, and help expand export.
</P>
<P>
According to the new procedure, closed-end loans to foreign
trade firms refer to working capital loans, in either renminbi or
foreign exchange, extended to state-owned foreign trade firms who
are in the red but have orders for their profitable products.
</P>
<P>
The loans, to be extended by domestic Chinese commercial banks,
will be used to meet the reasonable working capital demand of such
businesses for raw material purchasing, production, processing and
export, as well as working capital demand of overseas contracted
engineering projects.
</P>
<P>
Borrowers of the loans must be state-owned enterprises with
foreign trade rights or with the right to contract engineering
projects overseas.
</P>
<P>
The procedure specified that effective security is required for
the closed-end loans.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that banks should reinforce their supervision to
ensure that the loans are operating in a "closed-end" way.
</P>
<P>
The procedure provided detailed regulations on the
qualification of foreign trade companies for such loans and the
way that closed-end loans should be handled.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Meets Corazon, Sin on "Concord" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada agreed Monday with former president Corazon Aquino and
Manila Archbishop Jaime Cardinal Sin to pursue dialogue on the
Constitutional Correction and Development (Concord) process.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached during the president's meeting with
the Cardinal and Mrs. Aquino at the prelate's residence in Metro
Manila Monday afternoon to celebrate the Cardinal's 71st birthday.
</P>
<P>
"What we agreed about is that we will consult each other more
often about pursuing economic reforms through Concord," the
president said after the hour-long meeting.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said he will see to it that "misunderstandings" would
no longer occur by conducting "more consultations with the
religious sector".
</P>
<P>
The Cardinal and Mrs. Aquino were the lead convenors of the
recent August 20 rally held nationwide in protest of the Concord,
which they said might be used as a tool to extend Estrada's term.
</P>
<P>
"The mechanism of dialogue among representatives of the
government and the August 20 convenors is meant to have more sober
discussions on the Concord," according to a joint statement issued
by President Estrada, Mrs. Aquino and Cardinal Sin.
</P>
<P>
The Cardinal, who pointed out that he and the president are not
foes but actually share many things in common, voiced his
continuing support for the government's programs aimed at
uplifting the lives of the poor.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Estrada reiterated his call for the people
to actively participate in the Concord process aimed at pushing
forward economic reforms through relaxing the constitutional
restrictions on foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
For her part, Mrs. Aquino urged the government to continue
exploring and addressing other pressing needs and concerns of the
Filipino people, especially the poor, while awaiting the outcome
of the Concord process.
</P>
<P>
The president is scheduled to meet later Monday evening with
former president Fidel Ramos on the Concord issue at the
Presidential Residence.

<HEADLINE> Somali Militiamen Loot Refinery Items for Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Apart from the hundreds of
thousands of Somalis who died in the civil strife in the past nine
years, the country is now facing severe destruction, since
militiamen keep looting items of the remaining factories for
export abroad.
</P>
<P>
People have started preying on the only oil refinery just
outside Mogadishu. Large ceramic tubes and containers capable of
carrying more than 400 barrels of oil each are now being loaded on
heavy duty trailers on their way to the natural port of El-Ma'an
port for export. One of the men involved in this business told
Xinhua that they are heading for the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
One of the gunmen who dug these containers out of the refinery
said they sell each of the 200 barrels containers with 2,000 U.S.
dollars to the businessmen while the ones with the capacity of 400
barrels are being sold for 5,000 U.S. dollars. "We're making good
fortunes we never dreamed of out of these containers," he told
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The refinery is situated in Medina district of the capital.
Armed militiamen loyal to factional leaders have started digging
the containers and tubes recently to sell the smaller ones to
local businessmen and export the large containers and tubes to the
UAE in exchange for money.
</P>
<P>
This refinery was built by the late regime in its last years
funded by the Iraqi government and it is one of the last factories
that has escaped the destruction of the civil war. Apart from it,
the tobacco and cigarette producing factory remains intact, while
the government owned Marerey Sugar Plant was the first target
being looted and exported abroad.
</P>
<P>
The theft of all useful materials from Somalia is not only
confined to the factories, but militiamen also destroyed
government buildings and bridges to steal the steel and iron for
sales in the markets in cheap prices to those trying to build new
houses.

<HEADLINE> Shanxi Cuts Coal Production By 70 Million Tons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Shanxi, China's largest coal-
producing province, has so far closed 2,910 coal mines this year,
or one third of the province's total, and cut coal production by
nearly 70 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Presently, coal supply exceeds demand by a big margin
nationwide, particularly in Shanxi which reports an annual coal
output of around 330 million tons, or one fourth of the country's
total.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, the province has taken
effective measures to rectify the coal markets by shutting down a
large number of small and illegal coal mines, and supporting the
development of the state-owned large-sized coal enterprises. The
province expects to cut coal production by 100 million tons by the
end of this year.
</P>
<P>
During the January-July period, the key state-owned coal
enterprises of the province sold 7 million tons more coal, as
compared with the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The key coal enterprises have given priority to readjusting
product mix and improving quality and have changed their operation
modes from being extensive to intensive.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Lawmakers Approve Private Business Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 30 (Xinhua)-- Chinese legislators today
approved the Law on Solely-funded Enterprises in an effort to
regulate and protect the development of the private sector.
</P>
<P>
The law, which goes into effect on January 1, 2000, is the
first legislative act to echo the new constitutional principle of
upgrading the position of non-public sectors, which was added in
March this year.
</P>
<P>
The legislation for private business will be of great
significance to the Chinese economy, just as important as the
household responsibility system was to the country's vast rural
reform in the late 1970s, members of the Standing Committee of the
Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), China's top legislature,
point out.
</P>
<P>
The law covers stipulations on qualifications and procedures of
establishing solely-funded enterprises, personnel and business
management, disintegration and liquidation, as well as legal
responsibilities for offending the law.
</P>
<P>
Foreign private enterprises are not subject to the law.
</P>
<P>
It affirms that the government "protects the property and other
legal rights and interests of the solely-funded enterprises
according to law."
</P>
<P>
The law also prohibits government departments and officials
from compelling the enterprises to offer funds, material resources
and manpower, and outlines the penalties for violators.
</P>
<P>
All the above regulations are aimed at further ensuring the
legal rights and interests of solely-funded enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The controversial issue of "dual taxation" on solely-funded
businesses was left unaddressed in the law, which means that
owners of such enterprises may have to pay tax for business
transactions as well as personal income.
</P>
<P>
Wang Weicheng, chairman of the NPC Law Committee, said solving
the problem will depend on the improvement of the overall taxation
mechanism, and detailed taxation policies will be discussed in
future legislation.

SNOW DRAGON SHIP, August 30 (Xinhua) -- China's first Arctic
expedition and research has come to an end, and the expedition
ship, Snow Dragon, carrying more than 100 scientists and
journalists, is homeward bound.
</P>
<P>
The memorabilia of the expedition are as follows:
</P>
<P>
At the end of this May, China announced its plan about the
North Pole expedition, which aims to study the effect of the North
Pole on the global climate, especially on that of China, the
ecological system in Arctic waters as well as on the atmosphere,
geology, fishing and marine environment of the area.
</P>
<P>
On July 1, Snow Dragon ship, the ice breaker carrying 122 team
members, left Shanghai in east China.
</P>
<P>
On July 9, a potentially dangerous oil leak on Snow Dragon was
repaired after six hours.
</P>
<P>
On July 12, the expedition ship arrived at Nome Harbor in
Alaska, United States, and a Taiwanese scientist joined the team
there.
</P>
<P>
On July 14, Snow Dragon entered the Arctic Circle through
Bering Strait, and the expedition team began researches.
</P>
<P>
On July 18, expedition encountered polar bears for the first
time. And the team have met with 10 bears during their expedition.
</P>
<P>
On July 19, expedition left Arctic Circle to the Bering Sea due
to complicated weather situation, and expedition members persisted
research despite four-meter-high waves in Bering Sea.
</P>
<P>
On July 31, expedition discovered an anchored buoy that was an
ocean supervising device for weather forecasting. Expedition

</P>
<P>
On August 3, expedition reentered the Arctic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
On August 6, Chinese scientists obtained the world's first
absolute gravity data in Arctic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
On August 9, scientists detected an unusual thick inversion
layer at low levels above the Arctic Ocean. The temperature of the

conduct a one-week comprehensive survey.
</P>
<P>
On August 21, expedition ship collided with a huge floating ice
due to wind and fog, but no people were hurt.
</P>
<P>
On August 23, expedition was slightly disoriented by GPS
problem -- the satellite clock out of sync.

<HEADLINE> Contention Over Singapore Elected President's Power Is Educational Experience: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong said that the recent contention over elected president's
power and role has been an educational experience for all.
</P>
<P>
Goh made the point at a reception he hosted Monday to bid
farewell to outgoing President Ong Teng Cheong, the country's
first elected president who will end his term of office Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Ong's July 16 press conference where Ong revealed
there were some problems in the relationship with the government
and the statements made in reply in parliament one month later by
Minister for Finance Richard Hu and himself, Goh said, "They
crystallized the issues in contention, and clarifies the powers
and role of the elected president in simple non-legal language
that ordinary people understood."
</P>
<P>
"It has been an educational experience for all of us: the
president, government, MPs and the people," Goh said.
</P>
<P>
Singaporeans now know better how the system of an elected
president with custodian powers works and how decisions and
actions have to be publicly justified whenever questioned, he
added.
</P>
<P>
President Ong agreed with the prime minister's idea about the
"educational experience", saying "there were teething problems in
working out the system but these will pass by and by."
</P>
<P>
Ong, who was elected president in 1993, also said that "the
past six years was a test of the transparency and the working of
the system of the elected president" and that at the end of his
term he had accounted to the people of Singapore "what I had done
to fulfill the mandate they had given me and the pledge that I had
made during electioneering."
</P>
<P>
On September 1, there will be a farewell ceremony for President
Ong followed by a swearing-in ceremony for President-elect S. R.
Nathan.

TEHRAN, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Iran's national soccer team has
been invited by the United States Soccer Federation to play three
friendly matches in the U.S. at the beginning of next year.
</P>
<P>
The official Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported that
the invitation has been forwarded to the Iranian Soccer Federation.
</P>
<P>
The three matches are Iran vs El-Salvador on January 9, 2000 in
Los Angeles; Iran vs Mexican national team on January 12, in San
Francisco; and Iran vs the U.S. in Los Angles on January 16.
</P>
<P>
Cultural and sports exchange between Iran and the U.S. has
increased since Iran's moderate President Mohammad Khatami
advocated "people-to-people contacts" and "dialog among
civilization" soon after he took office in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In February 1998, American wrestlers were invited to attend a
competition in Iran for the first time since 1979.
</P>
<P>
The two countries cut off relations in 1980 after U.S. embassy
staffers were held hostage by radical Iranian students in 1979 in
the heydays of the Islamic Revolution.
</P>
<P>
IRNA said the Iranian Soccer Federation has not yet responded
to the invitation.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Lawmakers Call For Continued Fight Against Lee's Splittist Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"We must ensure that Taiwan's status as an inalienable part of
the Chinese territory not be altered" by Lee's malicious
conspiracies, said Yang Guiqing in a speech jointly authored by
himself and Liu Yiming, Yan Keqiang, Du Yijin, and Tong Fu, and
delivered at a legislative session.
</P>
<P>
The five legislators also pointed out that more should be done
to explain to Taiwan compatriots the Central Government's policy
on peaceful reunification and the perilous consequences of Lee's "
two states" remarks that redefine the cross-Straits relations as "
state-to-state."
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers said that Lee's remarks have created chaos on the
island by sending the stock market into a downward spiral. His
words also betrayed the best interests of the Taiwan compatriots
by running counter to their desire for peace, stability and
development.
</P>
<P>
Lee Teng-hui's remarks are an insult to the patriotic public in
Taiwan because they, just like the rest of the Chinese people,
value the tradition of patriotism and unity, the lawmakers said.
</P>
<P>
History has proven that the smooth development of cross-Straits
relations means real benefits to the Taiwan people, the lawmakers
noted. Taiwan's trade surplus with the mainland exceeded 95
billion U.S. dollars in the past 20 years and played a significant
role in Taiwan's industrial growth, they said.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan issue was a result of China's civil war, and the
current separation is just temporary and not grounds for a
permanent segregation, they said.

<HEADLINE> People's Harmony, Strength in Overcoming Economic Crisis: Mahathir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The harmony among the
people is a matter of great strength in overcoming the economic
crisis, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said Monday.
</P>
<P>
This strength has enabled the government to come up with
approaches to regain control over the local currency and the stock
market until they could no longer be manipulated by foreigners,
Mahathir said in his message broadcast via Radio and Television
Malaysia Monday Night in conjunction with Malaysia's 42nd National
Day which falls on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's experience in the economic crisis, which saw the
ringgit depreciating almost 100 percent against the U.S. dollar
and the loss of 500 billion ringgit (131.578 billion U.S. dollars)
in stock market capitalization, should be a lesson in facing the
challenges in the 21st century and the new millennium, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said although Malaysia is small and weak, it has
proven that a government strongly supported by a majority of the
people is able to defend its freedom as well as overcoming foreign
pressures and putting the country back on the road to recovery.
</P>
<P>
"The start of the new century and millennium is also the right
time for us to discard all the bad traits that have hindered our
development and for us to seriously practice whatever is good for
us and our country to progress," Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
"Malaysians will be able to defend this beloved country if we
recognize the dangers that we face and if we acquire all the
necessary knowledge and skill," Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
Calling on Malaysians to strengthen the confidence in their own
ability as they are just as good as others, if not better,
Mahathir said Malaysians can defend the country against any
threat, not by military strength but by acquiring knowledge and
proficiency in technology fields in the era of communication
freedom.
</P>
<P>
He said this year's National Day celebration, the last for this
century and millennium, is the best time for the people to reflect
upon the country's present situation, their achievements in the
past and the future direction as well as objective.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that in politics, Malaysia continued to maintain
good relations among the races and political stability while in
economics, the country has developed at a faster rate and able to
defend itself against economic attacks by foreigners.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Treasury Bonds Give Chinese Government Leverage over Economy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has moved
into its second consecutive year of stimulating economic growth by
widening the budget deficit with today's approval by the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) to issue 60
billion yuan-worth of additional treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
The unprecedented move shows that the Chinese government views
the issuance of treasury bonds as a major means of stimulating
economic growth. It has long abandoned the practice of not raising
domestic and foreign debts and increased the issuance of treasury
bonds from year to year.
</P>
<P>
Some local economists said that active financial policy
provides short-term leverage for China's economy, adding that it
cannot be adopted as a normal practice from year to year because
it may squeeze out enterprise and private investment.
</P>
<P>
However, Minister of Finance Xiang Huaicheng said that with the
present lackluster investment and consumer markets, issuing
additional treasury bonds to support the active financial policy
is "both necessary and practical."
</P>
<P>
Professor Huang Da, president of the China Monetary Society,
said that China has taken a long-awaited step forward by taking
financial policy as the second of its twin pillars of economic
policy, besides monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, China successfully promoted the economic growth rate
by 1.5 percentage points through issuing 100 billion yuan-worth of
additional treasury bonds to fund infrastructure construction.
</P>
<P>
It will use the money from issuing additional treasury bonds
this year to fund ongoing key construction projects, technological
renovations in leading industries, localization of crucial
equipment for production, commercialization of new and hi-tech
advances, environmental and biological projects, and
infrastructure for scientific and educational purposes.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the central treasury's budget deficit for the year
will swell to 180.3 billion yuan from the planned 150.3 billion
yuan as of the beginning of the year. Some 30 billion yuan worth
of the additional treasury bonds will be issued by local
governments, not on the central budget.

<P>
Xiang said that compared with last year, the active financial
policy for this year is broader and more powerful, and focused on
high-return fields. He said that channeling T-bond money to key
construction projects, technological renovation, and development
of the west will push forward related industries and increase the
monetary reserve.
</P>
<P>
Well-known Chinese economist Wu Jinglian said that in the long
run, government investment funded by issuing treasury bonds will
continue to be the government's first choice for stimulating
growth.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that measures such as encouraging consumption
and exports and adjusting tax structure cannot have an immediate
impact on the economy.
</P>
<P>
Mi Jianguo, an economist from the Development Research Center
under the State Council, said that due to increasing competition
from Southeast Asian economies that are recovering from the
financial crisis, China cannot resume its high growth rate of
exports in the near future. It will take the country 2-3 years to
jumpstart lackluster domestic consumption, he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that there is plenty of room for issuing
additional treasury bonds both in terms of supply and demand. On
one hand, the banks have deposit-to-loan surplus of more than 1,
000 billion yuan. On the other hand, the development of
infrastructure and technological renovation requires large amount
of funds.
</P>
<P>
The additional issuance of treasury bonds this year will be
sold totally to commercial banks, thus converting savings surplus
into investment.
</P>
<P>
Wu Jinglian said China's government debts account for less than
ten percent of the gross domestic product (GDP), far below the
international danger zone of 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
He said that if China issued 100 billion yuan worth of
additional treasury bonds every year, it would be safe from any
serious financial risks for at least the next three years.
</P>
<P>
China planned to issue 341.5 billion yuan worth of government
bonds at home and abroad at the beginning of the year. The
issuance of additional bonds will boast the figure to over 400
billion yuan this year.

<HEADLINE> "One Country, Two Systems" Fully Implemented: Tung </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Tung Chee Hwa said here
Monday that since the return of Hong Kong to the motherland, the
HKSAR government had fully implemented the principle of "one
country, two systems" and protected the liberties of Hong Kong
people and their way of life according to the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
Since last week, the chief executive has been meeting members
of the Legislative Council to listen to their views on various
issues of public concern for his upcoming policy address.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting Monday afternoon, Tung said, "The legal system
in Hong Kong is firmly entrenched and protected by the Basic Law.
In the two years since the return, the Judiciary has continued to
administer justice fairly and impartially."
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong residents continue to enjoy the freedoms of speech
and of the press," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the question of right of abode, the chief executive
emphasized that seeking an interpretation from the National People
's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee was legal and constitutional.
The issue was resolved entirely in accordance with the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
As for the establishment of a press council proposed in the Law
Reform Commission consultation papers, the chief executive stated
that the government would examine the proposal carefully before
putting a submission to the Law Reform Commission. The government'

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Shi Guangsheng, China's Minister
of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC), said today he
believes that China's trade volume with the Czech Republic will
increase remarkably as long as both countries continue mutual
understanding and exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Shi said this in talks here with visiting Czech Minister of
Industry and Trade Moroslav Gregr.
</P>
<P>
Trade and economic cooperation between China and Czech has
shown significant growth in recent years. Sino-Czech trade volume
increased a year-on-year 12.9 percent in the first eight months of
this year, Shi said.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that the trade volume is still
disproportionate to the scale of economic development in both
countries, due to a lack of awareness of the changes taking place
in both countries' market situation and the need for merchandise.
</P>
<P>
Gregr assured Shi that China's huge market remains a temptation
to Czech and that the prospect for bilateral trade and economic
cooperation is solid.

<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The theater missile defense (
TMD) system, which is being developed by the United States and
Japan and will be deployed in East Asia, is a "most dangerous
criminal act," a unnamed DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The TMD system, which uses satellites to pinpoint incoming
missiles and shoot them down, will sabotage the balance of power
in the region and provoke a new arms race and second cold war,
which could pose a crisis for peace and stability in the world,
said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the U.S. allegation of a DPRK missile threat
is a deception to make the TMD system sound acceptable.

<P>
BEIJING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Worldwide philatelists and

<HEADLINE> China's Top Legislator On Role of People's Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislator today
stressed that the role of the congressional system in ensuring
democracy in China should be supported by the people and improved
by the lawmakers themselves.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress (NPC), said the NPC and local people's
congresses should enhance the work of legislation and supervision
by promoting their own work.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks here today at the closing ceremony of the
eleventh meeting of the Ninth NPC Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
"NPC deputies and the standing committee members should set up
close ties with ordinary people to have better understanding about
current situations, so that they can truly represent the people
and protect the people's interests," he said.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the 45-year-history of the NPC, Li pointed out that
the system has been improved in remarkable ways, such as the
direct election of people's congress deputies at and above the
county level.
</P>
<P>
Functions and powers of the NPC Standing Committee have been
expanded, and more local laws are being created, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Li also stressed the key role of the Communist Party of China
in the people's congress system, saying that development of a
socialist country based on the rule of law should be under the
leadership of the Party.

<HEADLINE> UK Hires Gender Adviser to Boost Women's Diplomatic Careers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Britain's foreign office is
recruiting a gender equality adviser as part of an urgent program
to halt an exodus of women from all levels of the country's
diplomatic service.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook ordered immediate action
following evidence that many women leave the diplomatic service
once they reach their late twenties and early thirties.
</P>
<P>
The gender adviser, who could be of either sex, will be
recruited from open competition, initially for a 12-month contract
on a salary of up to 63,876 pounds (10,220 U.S. dollars) pro rata,
based on an 18-hour week.
</P>
<P>
His or her job will be to identify why women are leaving and
whether there are any obstacles to their promotion. All women who
leave are now asked to fill out a detailed questionnaire giving
their reasons.
</P>
<P>
The drive coincides with a new edict from Prime Minister Tony
Blair that all government departments must ensure that a high
proportion of their senior staff are women.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Office has set a target, seeking to increase the
percentage of women employed in top jobs another 7-20 percent by
2005.
</P>
<P>
At present, women make up almost 37 percent of the Foreign
Office workforce. There are also seven women ambassadors or high
commissioners around the world from Cape Town to Colombo.

causes pollution.
</P>
<P>
The declaration urges postal departments throughout the world
to contribute to the improvement of the environment.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Legislature Passes Public Bidding Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- China's highest legislative body
today approved a law to regulate public bidding in the building
sector in a move to curb shoddy construction projects caused by
corruption when tenders are invited and submitted.
</P>
<P>
The Law for Inviting and Submitting Tender was passed at the
eleventh meeting of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC)
Standing Committee, and will go into effect on January 1 next year.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers expected the new law to "crack down upon malpractice
and low transparency in the course of public bidding", which have
been rampant in recent years and blamed as major causes of poor-
quality construction in China.
</P>
<P>
The law stipulates that all large scale infrastructure and
public projects which are thoroughly or partially funded by the
state, international organizations or foreign government loans
have to undergo public bidding which will cover the survey and the
design and the construction of projects, as well as quality
inspection and purchase of major equipment and materials.
</P>
<P>
"Public bidding should be subject to open, fair, equal and
honest principles, as well as the supervision of law", the law
stresses and it also provides detailed regulations on bidding
procedures and punishments for offenders.
</P>
<P>
In order to ensure the fairness of bidding, the law also
highlights the responsibilities of bidding board members and
outlines the penalties for offenders, such as the confiscation of
bribes and a range of fines.

PARIS, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The French distributor "Carrefour"
will launch a friendly take-over bid and merger with its
competitor "Promodes," by offering six shares of Carrefour for one
of Promodes, the two groups announced on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The offer by Carrefour represents a 20 percent premium for the
shareholders of Promodes on the basis of the stock's value on
Friday, and 25 percent in one month, 24 percent in two months and
23 percent in three months.
</P>
<P>
As a result, some 115 million new shares of Carrefour will
replace those of Promodes in the stock market. The new entity will
offer 49 billion euros (51.45 billion U.S. dollars) worth of stock
for sale, the third largest offering on the list of the CAC 40 on
the Bourse in Paris.
</P>
<P>
The merged group projects annual sales of 54 billion euros (56.
70 billion U.S. dollars), 85 percent of which will be sold in
Europe through its 8,800 shops in 26 countries including 680 hyper-
markets, 2,600 supermarkets and 3,200 ``maxi discompte'' (maxi-
discount) shops, all of which employ 240,000 people.
</P>
<P>
With the merger, France will have the first distributor in
Europe larger than the "German Metro," and the world's second
largest after "Wal-Mart" in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Daniel Bernard, the president of Carrefour, will become the
president of the newly merged group.
</P>
<P>
The Promodes owns the "Continent hyper-market," "Shopi
supermarket," "Champion" and "Huit et 8."
</P>
<P>
The two groups expect sales figures to double by the year 2002.

</P>
<P>
The efforts were initiated by Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif at the request of Rabbani for Pakistan's role in the
resolution of the long-standing turmoil in Afghanistan, according
to a recent Pakistan official statement.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has repeatedly said it is sincerely for the peaceful
solution to the Afghan problem and that it is willing to act as an
equitable mediator between the Afghan opposition and ruling
Taliban.
</P>
<P>
Qanooni, however, accused Pakistan of supporting Taliban and
sending troops to the ranks of the Islamic militia, which has
raised doubts and created a sense of uncertainty over the ongoing
peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Qanooni's statements tend to vitiate the atmosphere," said the
statement, adding that Pakistan's peace efforts can succeed only
when those engaged in fighting cooperate with it.

ISLAMABAD, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani President Rafiq
Tarar Monday said that sufferings of the Iraqi people caused by
the U.N. sanctions need to be alleviated as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
Talking to Speaker of the Iraqi National Assembly Sa'doon

Security Council resolution 687 which ended the Gulf War in 1991.

lift all sanctions imposed on Iraq as provided in the same

<HEADLINE> Egypt Pushes Forward Israeli-Palestinian Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 30 (Xinhua) -- A senior adviser to Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak continued shuttling between the Israeli
and Palestinian sides Monday in a bid to break a deadlock over
the implementation of a U.S.-brokered peace deal.
</P>
<P>
Osama el-Baz met with senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb
Erekat in the West Bank town of Ramallah Monday afternoon and
will later meet Israeli negotiator Gilad Sher, Israel Radio
said.
</P>
<P>
El-Baz arrived in the region Sunday night after Israeli and
Palestinian negotiations hit a snag over the release of
Palestinian prisoners and the timetable for a final Israeli
troop redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have been in the hope of reaching an agreement
before U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright starts a visit
to the region on September 1, and of holding a signing ceremony in
Cairo when Albright visits Egypt Thursday.
</P>
<P>
After the talks broke down Sunday afternoon, Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak threatened in a statement to implement the
Wye agreement according to Israeli interpretation if the
Palestinians do not give "satisfactory answers" within "the coming
hours" on the issue of prisoners and troop redeployment.
</P>
<P>
El-Baz met respectively with Palestinian National Authority
Chairman Yasser Arafat and Barak Sunday evening, but was
unable to mediate a breakthrough. But before meeting with the
Egyptian envoy, Erekat denied the shuttle diplomacy of el-Baz
was a failure.
</P>
<P>
Since Barak taking office early last month on a pledge to
move forward the peace process with all Israel's Arab neighbors,
Egypt has increased its role in mediating the Israeli-Palestinian
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians demand that Israel release 650 political
prisoners, those jailed for anti-Israel activity, but Israel
insists that it will release only 500 prisoners and will not
free those Palestinians involved in killings of Israelis.
</P>
<P>
On the redeployment issue, Barak has proposed to postpone
the last of the three stages of troop withdrawals stipulated
in the Wye accord until February next year, when the
final-status talks dealing with thorny issues like Jerusalem and
Palestinian statehood are well under way.
</P>
<P>
But the Palestinians want Israel to complete all the troop
withdrawals on an earlier date in line with the original
timetable of the Wye accord, under which Israel has to hand
over another 11 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians
in two stages.
</P>
<P>
Erekat and Sher met into early Monday but failed to break
the latest deadlock. They will meet again later in the
afternoon, the Israeli Prime Minister's office said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy accused the Palestinians
Monday of trying to create an atmosphere of crisis ahead of
Albright's visit by not agreeing to the Israeli proposals.
</P>
<P>
Barak has asked Washington to scale down its mediating role
in the peace process, but the Palestinians want the U.S. to
continue playing an active role.
</P>
<P>
Despite the current impasse, there are still signs showing
that the two sides are narrowing their gaps on the major
issue of Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The statement issued by Barak's office Sunday night said
Israel will not release jailed members of Hamas or Islamic Jihad,
hinting that members of other Palestinian political groups might
be eligible for release.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 30 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
expressed concern on Monday about the trade dispute between the
United States and the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Chirac said the dispute could be resolved satisfactorily and he
regretted U.S. sanctions which are striking some French
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The United States has imposed sanctions on some EU food
products after Brussels refused to import U.S. hormone-fed beef
products.
</P>
<P>
Some French agricultural products, including Roquefort cheese,
have been put on the list of trade sanctions by the U.S., which
imposes a 100 percent extra customs duty on them.
</P>
<P>
The French president had a meeting with French members of the
Trans-Atlantic Business Dialogue, a forum of European and American
businessmen dedicated to making suggestions aimed at easing trade
and investment conditions between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that France hopes the forum members are successful
in conveying the importance of trade between the United States and
Europe.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank (WB) will fund
two major infrastructure projects in Uganda to improve the
country's quality of infrastructure and thus stimulate the

The two projects, costing a total sum of 88 million U.S.
dollars, will be completed by June of 2000, a review mission from
the bank in Washington told a press conference here Monday

</P>
<P>
The projects, namely the local government development project
and the Nakivubo channel rehabilitation project, will mainly
funded by the international financial institution.
</P>
<P>
"The World Bank will provide the fund to the central government
which will give the money to the Kampala city council or some
ministry which is responsible for the projects," Gautam Sengupta,
task manager of the WB projects in Uganda said.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the accountability of the fund earmarked for
the projects, the manager said that the World Bank will keep close

<HEADLINE> Cambodia to Levy Tax on Imported Alcohol, Cigarettes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government expects to collect about 1.6 billion riel (about
420,000 U.S. dollars) annually from the new taxes which can
greatly boost government revenues.
</P>
<P>
The tax bill was passed late last year by the National Assembly
after plans were scrapped for a 3 percent tax on electricity.
</P>
<P>
According to Finance Minister Keat Chhon, revenues from the new
tax will be used to construct street lights in Phnom Penh and
major towns in the country.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of the 10 percent Value Added Tax earlier this
year has earned 44.2 million U.S. dollars which accounted for more
than 60 percent of the total revenues collected by the government
in the first six months of this year.
</P>
<P>
But some importers and cigarette manufactures worried the new
taxes will have an undesirable effect on smuggling because of the
rise of commodity prices in Cambodia.

<HEADLINE> China to Levy Tax on Savings Interest (More Added) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese lawmakers adopted
amendments to the Law on Personal Income Tax by 121 votes here
today, deleting the phrase "interest from savings deposits" from
items listed for tax exemption.
</P>
<P>
However, one member of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress (NPC), China's top legislature, voted against
the amendments and another 10 abstained.
</P>
<P>
The NPC Standing Committee agreed that the time for beginning
to levy tax on bank savings deposits and measures for levying the
tax will be decided by the State Council later.
</P>
<P>
According to Xiang Huaicheng, Minister of Finance, this new
source of state revenue will be used to increase subsidies and
allowances for workers laid off by state-owned enterprises, boost
the minimum income of urban dwellers, and replenish long-delayed
pensions for the retired.
</P>
<P>
He said that the tax will cover deposits in both the yuan and
foreign currencies in Chinese banks.
</P>
<P>
Xiang said the levying of the savings interest will be
favorable for stimulating the consumer sector and narrowing the
gaps between the rich and the poor.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that since the 1970s, the volume of the national
savings deposits has been ranking top in the world.
</P>
<P>
Between 1989 and 1997, national savings deposits accounted for
over 35 percent of China's gross national product.
</P>
<P>
As for the gap between the rich and the poor, legislative
sources said, the savings deposits of high-income households
accounts for half of the total while that of the middle and low-
income households combined accounts for the remaining half.
However, the latter accounts for 90 percent of the country's
depositors.
</P>
<P>
During the review of the amendments, quite a few legislators
pointed out that the levy of the tax on savings deposits should
give certain consideration to low-income residents.
</P>
<P>
They suggested introducing the practice of a progressive tax on
savings deposits, in an effort to practically narrow the gap
between the rich and the poor.
</P>
<P>
The NPC Standing Committee recommended that the State Council
adopt the "positive views and suggestions" of the members of the
Standing Committee in drafting measures for implementing the
amended law.
</P>
<P>
According to a sample survey made in Beijing, Tianjin and
Shanghai, 53.7 percent of the interviewees expressed their support
for the levy of savings deposits tax.
</P>
<P>
The savings deposit interest rate for a one-year term has
dropped from 9.16 percent in 1996 to today's 2.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Beijing residents are expected to accept the new tax as another
cut in bank interests.

towards its potential in the United States, and there are clearer
signs of recovery in some economic sectors in Japan and China's
pro-active fiscal policy together with continued restructuring of
the banking sector and state-owned enterprises would support
growth.
</P>
<P>
The summary said the group discussed efforts to reform the
international financial architecture, including the ongoing work
of the Financial Stability Forum and recognized necessity for the
co-ordination of international bodies with different expertise to
monitor the implementation of the wide range of international
standards.
</P>
<P>
There was broad support for better disclosure from highly
leveraged institutions and better risk management by the creditors
and counterparties of such institutions, it added.
</P>
<P>
The summary said the group agreed that capital account
liberalization needs to be carefully sequenced within a framework
of sound financial supervision and prudential regulation and
should also be supported by adequate reporting requirements for
capital flows.
</P>
<P>
According to the summary, the group broadly agreed on the
importance to achieve more substantial progress to involve the
private sector in the prevention and resolution of financial
crisis and reached consensus that the choice of an appropriate
exchange rate regime would depend on each economy's circumstances
and institutional features.
</P>
<P>
The Meeting of Finance and Central Bank Deputies under the

<HEADLINE> China's Economy, Reform Enter Critical New Phase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 30 (Xinhua) -- China's economy has entered a
new phase of development as its economic growth will be more
moderate than in the past two decades but the pace of reform will
be accelerated, Standard Chartered Bank's economists stressed
Monday.
</P>
<P>
A report in the latest Standard Chartered Viewpoints released
on Monday said that as reform progressively breaks the "iron rice
bowl" of most urban dwellers in China, consumer spending is no
longer growing as fast as in the past.
</P>
<P>
For the economy as a whole, a lower rate of growth in consumer
spending means a lower rate of economic growth, it said.
</P>
<P>
But the bank's economists said that they are optimistic that
China will avoid a major economic slowdown. With the government
efforts to stimulate the economy such as increased infrastructure
investment spending and interest rate cuts, growth is expected to
be around 7.5 percent in the second half of 1999 and in 2000, they
noted.
</P>
<P>
China's exports are also improving in the recent months,
according to the report. The trade surplus is expected to increase
in the coming months, and its contribution to GDP growth will turn
around from -2.5 percent in the first half of 1999 to 0.4 percent
in the second half, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The economists believed that the success or otherwise of China'
s reform will be critical to the long and medium term prospects of
the country. China is seeking a breakthrough in its reform of the
state-owned enterprises, the report said.
</P>
<P>
More decisive steps are likely to be taken in its banking and
housing reform, and more efforts will be put to nurturing the
development of the non-state sector of the economy, according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
"These reform measures, coupled with China's WTO accession
efforts, mean that there will be a lot of changes in China's
economy in the coming years," a senior economist here predicted.
</P>
<P>
But the task of maintaining a balance between reform and growth
will be more challenging for the country in the coming years, he
warned.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Claim Compensation for Downing of Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan plans to submit a
claim of 56 million U.S. dollars in the International Court of
Justice against India as compensation for shooting down a
Pakistani naval aircraft earlier this month, sources said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistan Navy has given its recommendations to the Foreign
Ministry for the submission of the compensation claim, said the
sources.
</P>
<P>
India shot down the unarmed Pakistani plane on August 10 in
international border area, killing 16 people on board, including
five naval officers.
</P>
<P>
"The Law Ministry and the Foreign Office are engaged in
preparation of the compensation appeal," said the sources.
</P>
<P>
They said probe into the incident is still continuing and the
report will be submitted to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif shortly.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan last week lodged a complaint with the United Nations
regarding the downing of the plane by India, saying this act of
"military aggression" has further increased tensions in the
region.

<HEADLINE> New Law Passed to Improve Construction Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Legal experts believe that the
passing today of the Law on Inviting and Submitting Tenders by
Chinese law-makers is a positive move to improve construction
quality and promote fair competition.
</P>
<P>
The new law, passed at the 11th session of the Standing
Committee of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), China's
top legislature, draws experience from more than 20 years of
public bidding and underlines the legitimate goal of protecting
the country's public interests.
</P>
<P>
After it takes effect on January 1 next year, it will help
enhance transparency in project bidding and equipment purchasing,
reduce spending, and improve construction quality and economic
returns, the experts noted.
</P>
<P>
The invitation and tender system was first introduced to China
in the 1980s, and was applied in the fields of foreign loans
utilization, equipment imports, construction project contracts,
and scientific research.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, public bidding saves one to
three percent of capital and shortens by 10 percent the time for
construction in relevant projects while saving 10 percent in
foreign exchange and 16 percent of investment in the imports of
equipment.
</P>
<P>
For giant projects, it is even more valuable since it also
brings to China state-of-the-art technologies from abroad.
</P>
<P>
However, before the introduction of the law, the public bidding
system was not effectively promoted and a direct result was the
downgrading of construction quality and an increase in accidents.
</P>
<P>
Authoritative sources disclose that 40 percent of local
economic crimes in many areas throughout China were related to
project contracts, including the bridge collapse in southwest
China's Chongqing city early this year which claimed scores of
people's lives.
</P>
<P>
China began drafting the law in June 1994.

<HEADLINE> South Runway Re-opens at HK International Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The South Runway at Hong Kong
International Airport re-opened Monday morning following the
successful recovery of the final section of the China Airlines
wreckage from the crash site, the Airport Authority (AA) said.
</P>
<P>
The runway had been closed since the MD-11 aircraft en route
from Bangkok to Taipei crashed on landing during severe tropical
storm Sam on August 22.
</P>
<P>
After a four-and-a-half-day operation, the wreckage was removed
in three pieces: the tail and nose sections were transported to a
holding site Sunday afternoon, while the mid-section -- the
heaviest of the three -- was removed Sunday midnight.
</P>
<P>
The runway was then swept and final repairs made before the
Civil Aviation Department was notified shortly before 06:00 a.m.
Monday that work had been completed. A Malaysian Airlines 747
bound for Kuala Lumpur was the first plane to take off from the re-
opened runway at 09:51 a.m.
</P>
<P>
"This was a difficult task involving the removal of a large
aircraft that came to rest upside down on soft ground," AA General
Manager of Airfield Operations Alan Lam said at a press briefing
Monday. "The weather was difficult -- at times dreadful -- and we
had to proceed one step at a time," he added while describing the
complexity of the removal operation.
</P>
<P>
"This challenging task involved up to 140 people working in
shifts round the clock to clean up the site and prepare the runway
for re-opening. Despite the difficulties, we completed the job in
the most practical, efficient and safest way possible," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the AA announced that as of 10:00 a.m. on Tuesday,
full 24-hour operations will commence as planned on the North
Runway.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Reportedly Orders to Counter U.S. "Veiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami has reportedly asked a "top decision-making body" to send
a strong reply to the United States in response to its recent
"veiled threat."
</P>
<P>
"Tehran Times" newspaper on Monday quoted an informed source
as saying the "veiled threat" was contained in a letter the
U.S. sent via Oman, which has cordial relations with Iran.
</P>
<P>
The letter, reportedly pertaining to regional issues, was
brought to Iran by Oman's Minister of State for Foreign Affairs
Yusef Bin Alavi more than 10 days ago. But when "Tehran Times"
broke the news on August 18, the Foreign Ministry was quick to
deny it.
</P>
<P>
An Omani diplomat here had also dismissed the report.
</P>
<P>
However, "Tehran Times" said the source insisted that
Washington had sent the message and Khatami has ordered to give it
a strong reply.
</P>
<P>
Khatami is also chairman of Iran's Supreme National Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear if the letter was concerning Iran's
territorial dispute with the United Arab Emirates over three
islands at the mouth of strategically important Strait of
Hormuz.
</P>
<P>
Iran took over Abu Musa, Greater and Lesser Tunbs in 1971 soon
after British colonist forces withdrew from the region.
</P>
<P>
Both Tehran and Abu Dhabi claimed full sovereignty over the
islands. The dispute has been an obstacle to Iran's
relations with the Gulf Arab countries. Iran insisted on
bilateral talks to resolve the issue, but the UAE called for an
international arbitration.
</P>
<P>
On the reason for sending the message via Oman, "Tehran Times"
quoted an observer as saying Washington was trying to woo the
support of the British lobby in the Persian Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
But some other observers doubt the authenticity of the
report, saying that hardliners may be trying to use foreign
affairs to mar Khatami's efforts to improve relations with
Western countries, including the U.S..

<HEADLINE> Manila Calls for Total Readiness Against Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada underscored Monday the need to step up efforts to
strengthen the country's defense system against the so-called
millennium bug or Y2K.
</P>
<P>
The president stressed that the Y2K problem should not get in
the way of the country's national efforts to be economically
stable and globally competitive in the world market.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the country's Y2K Commission, Estrada said all
sectors of society should do their share to avoid any possible
glitch in the computer system.
</P>
<P>
He also proclaimed the month of September as "Y2K Consciousness
Month."
</P>
<P>
While the government and the private sector are making dramatic
strides in the fight against the millennium bug, the president
said, there are still a lot more to be done.
</P>
<P>
Based on the latest report, the president said the finance
sector is already 93 percent prepared for the Y2K, utilities at 77
percent, telecommunications at 77 percent, and government services
at 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
But the president expressed confidence that through the Y2K
Commission's collective efforts the country shall "greet the year
2000 in better shape than other nations."
</P>
<P>
The Y2K Commission, set up a year ago, was tasked to address
the potential damage the millennium bug may inflict on the
economic well-being and security of the nation.
</P>
<P>
On June 1, the president signed into a law which empowers the
Y2K Commission to require government agencies, private companies,
associations and individuals to disclose their Y2K compliance
status and their contingency plans.

<HEADLINE> Dolphins Soon Extinct in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Dolphins which used to be
found roaming about in plenty in the Karnali river in far-western
Nepal are going to be extinct, according to the King Mahendra
Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC).
</P>
<P>
The Kathmandu Post Monday quoted senior wildlife expert Dr.
Gyawali of KMTNC as saying that only three dolphins were left in
the Karnali river, which is well-known as Nepal's longest river
with clean water.
</P>
<P>
The finding came from a study by Nilesh Timilsina from
Tribhuvan University who wrote a thesis entitled "Present Status
and Conservation of Dolphin in the Karnali River, 1999." The
thesis mentioned that only three dolphins were found in a survey
conducted in the Karnali river.
</P>
<P>
There were plenty of dolphins in the Karnali river in the
1970s, 20 by the end of the 1980s and seven in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The fact that dolphins have now reduced to three is an
indication that dolphins are on their way to becoming extinct
soon, according to KMTNC.
</P>
<P>
Gaywali said the prime reason was the construction of
Girijapuri dam by India blocking the Karnali river about 15 km
south of the Nepal-India border.
</P>
<P>
Dolphins are very beautiful aquatic animals. Once they are out
of the protected area, they may get killed due to poaching.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Banks Held Responsible for Shabby Naira </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Commercial banks are
recycling shabby, dirty naira notes on the currency market which
should have been sent back to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)
for replacement, reported the Vanguard, a leading Nigerian
newspaper Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-five out of the eighty-nine banks in the country were
found out to be guilty of this practice, which is against banking
laws and regulations, according to an investigation quoted by the
paper.
</P>
<P>
The banks usually refuse to change the old notes when asked by
their customers, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
Many banks also failed to install currency counting and sorting
machines as ordered by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) on cost
ground. The issue of acquisition of the machines has been a
running battle between the Central Bank and the banks since 1996
when the apex bank asked them to acquire their own machines.
Before then, the banks sorted their currencies at the CBN at no
cost.
</P>
<P>
Later, the CBN began to charge N3, 500 per box of unsorted
money as penalty. A box contains less than N100, 000, which has
been attributed to the unwillingness of the banks to return the
shabby notes.
</P>
<P>
By last month, the Central Bank had debited the banks accounts
to the tune of over N2 billion. And while the banks have
complained about the heavy costs incurred in the sorting exercise,
the CBN has remained resolute with the policy.
</P>
<P>
It was because of the high cost, a source said at the weekend,
that the commercial banks resorted to recycling dirty notes, to
avoid sending such to the CBN, and by extension, avoid incurring
debts, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
To be able to sort currency effectively, each bank will require
a minimum of five machines per branch - two for sorting, two for
counting and one for strapping, said a bank executive.
</P>
<P>
Since sending unsorted cash to the CBN attracts a charge of N3,
500 per box, some banks have resorted to charging customers N3.50
per leaf of dirty naira, in the alternative, post-dating their
cash lodgment above a certain amount, he said.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Reintroduce Pre-shipment Inspection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)
has released fresh guidelines for the reintroduction of
pre-shipment inspection scheme which takes effective on September
1 this year.
</P>
<P>
A circular sent by the bank to all authorized dealers,
destination inspection agents and the general public said that all
goods except for personal effects imported into the country would
be subjected to pre- shipment inspection in the country of supply,
The Daily Times reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines released in the circular stipulated the
exception of day- old-chicks, human eyes, human remains, vaccines,
yeast and periodicals/ magazines import from being subjected to
pre-shipment inspection.
</P>
<P>
Under the guidelines, any person importing goods into Nigeria
shall process a form "M" through any authorized commercial bank
irrespective of value and whether valid for forex or not while the
banks shall be responsible for delivering all form "M" to the
respective appointed inspection agents' liaison office in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government explained that the reintroduction of
pre- shipment inspection scheme was based on the fact that the
country is yet ready for destination inspection scheme introduced
in March this year.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Times investigation showed that within the short
period the destination inspection scheme was in operation, many
importers were said to have brought into the country contraband
and sub-standard goods while some engaged in over-invoicing to
cover up capital flight.
</P>
<P>
The circular also stipulated that issuance of a Clean Report of
 Inspection or a Discrepancy Report of Inspection shall be
mandatory for all imports.

<HEADLINE> New Foreign Direct Investment Approvals in Vietnam Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 30 (Xinhua) -- New foreign direct investment
(FDI) approved by the Vietnamese government in the first eight
months of the year dropped 42.9 percent from the same period last
year, Vietnam business newspaper The Saigon Times Daily reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese government licensed 157 new FDI projects worth
871 million U.S. dollars in the first eight months of this year,
accounting for 89.7 percent of the number of projects and 51.2
percent of the capital approved in the same period last year,
according to Vietnam's Ministry of Planning and Investment.
</P>
<P>
Despite the business sharp downturn, up to 993 million dollars
in foreign investment was realized in the first eight months,
dropping a mere 18 percent from the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
As the impact of the Asian financial and economic meltdown on
the Vietnamese economy continues, so most projects under operation
are still experiencing difficulties due to the shrinkage of
markets and the falling competitiveness of export items, The
Saigon Time Daily quoted analysts here as saying.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam now has 2,238 FDI projects under operation, with a
total investment pledges of 35 billion dollars, of which 15
billion dollars has been realized.

<HEADLINE> URGENT: China to Levy Tax on Savings Interest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- China's national legislature
passed an amendment to the Law on Personal Income Tax here today,
deleting the phrase "interest from bank savings deposits" from
those items listed as exempt from taxation.
</P>
<P>
According to Chinese Minister of Finance Xiang Huaicheng, this
new source of state revenue will be used to increase subsidies and
allowances for those workers laid off by State-owned enterprises,
enhance the minimum income of urban dwellers, and replenish long-
delayed pensions for the retired.
</P>
<P>
According to a plan proposed by the State Council, the tax rate
on savings interest will include deposits in both the yuan and
foreign currencies in Chinese banks.
</P>
<P>
But due to the suggestion by some legislators that low-income
depositors should not be taxed as heavily as the newly rich, the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress today asked
the State Council to work out relevant regulations concerning the
levying time and methods.

<HEADLINE> Debt Halt Privatization of Egypt's Power Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The privatization process of
Egypt's major power companies has been halted due to the huge debt
owed by public sector clients, a senior official of the Egyptian
Electricity Authority has said.
</P>
<P>
The debt problem has forced the power sector to delay several
times the implementation of the sector's privatization program,
the country's Arabic daily Al Akhbar reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Ministerial Privatization Committee under Prime Minister
Kamal El-Ganzouri decided in March last year to kick off the
privatization process of the power sector, the official said.
</P>
<P>
"But a year after the announcement, we are still unable to go
ahead with the plan because of the debt problem," he said on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports say that Egypt's seven regional power
generation and distribution companies are owed 9 billion Egyptian
pounds (2.65 billion U.S. dollars) by public sector clients and
owe 4.9 billion pounds (1.45 billion dollars) in taxes and other
dues to the government.
</P>
<P>
The power companies have repeated threats to cut power supply
to the public sector clients if they fail to pay the arrears, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The official regretted that the companies have no alternative
but to cut power supply if the debtors remain obstinate and
maintain their outrageous stance.
</P>
<P>
The official argued that they were compelled to issue the
warning as the power companies are in a difficult situation.
</P>
<P>
"In view of the current circumstances, we cannot submit the
stakes of the power firms to dealings in the stock exchange
market," he said.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Minister of Electricity and Energy Maher Abaza has
said Egypt would eventually sell 49 percent of the seven power
companies.

holding the polling that was very crucial for the future of East
Timor through various acts of intimidation, taking side and
driving voters to choose for anti autonomy.

number 264 called Zelos Da Zansos at around 07:30 a.m. local time
forcing some voters to choose National Council of East Timor
Resistance (CNRT) at polling station number 16 at Fomento village,

A tender will be awarded to the selected company as soon as the
mode of concessions is agreed upon, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Some of the concessioning modalities will be applied in the
company's freight services whose performance has not been
satisfactory, he added.
</P>
<P>
Siakanomba said that Tanzania-Zambia Railway will enter into a
contract with private investors to operate the services in the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Investors will also be allowed to make improvements on rail
wagons and the railway line to improve its standards, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Communications and Transport Minister David Saviye was
quoted as saying that the continued high spending by management
while freight figures tumbled is alarming and threatens the
company with closure.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the performance of the railway leaves
much to be desired mainly because of the management's failure to
motivate the workers.
</P>
<P>
Saviye complained that officials from the two countries have
resorted to attacking each other over the company's operations
instead of resolving the matter internally.

<P>
AMMAN, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Some 50 people, including police
officers, players and fans, were injured late Sunday night in
riots at a semifinal soccer match between Libya and Iraq at the
ninth Pan-Arab games in Amman.
</P>
<P>
When only five minutes were left before the end of the match,
with Iraqi team leading 3-1, Libyan fans ignited the riots by
attacking rival fans and TV cameramen in the King Abdullah Stadium
in eastern Amman.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese referee Nabeel Ayyad halted the match for a few
minutes and requested police's interference to avoid any further
harm to the players.
</P>
<P>
Riot police fired several tear gas canisters to force the
rioting Libyan fans to leave the stadium.
</P>
<P>
Some 50 people were hospitalized, including police officers and
three Palestinian players, but none in serious conditions. The
injured were discharged after minor treatment, hospital sources
said.
</P>
<P>
About 10,000 fans from the two countries attended the semifinal
match. Iraqi team will enter the final against the Jordanian hosts
which beat the Palestinians 4-1 at the other semifinal.
</P>
<P>
The referee is expected to submit a report on the match and the
riot to the organizing committee of the Games, which will convene
an emergency meeting Monday.

<HEADLINE> Estrada, His Two predecessors to Meet on Charter Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada has invited former presidents Fidel Ramos and Corazon
Aquino to discuss Charter changes Monday night, said Presidential
Spokesman Jerry Barican.
</P>
<P>
Barican also said Estrada has accepted an invitation from
Manila Archbishop Jaime Cardinal Sin to attend a mass at Sin's
residence later Monday.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Estrada said he was willing to discuss political
issues with his two predecessors, including his administration's
call for economic reforms through Charter changes.
</P>
<P>
The president also promised to meet Cardinal Sin, but stressed
their meeting would focus on spiritual matters because he has to
observe the principle on the separation of the Church and the
State.
</P>
<P>
On August 20, Corazon Aquino and Cradinal Sin led a nationwide
rally to oppose attempts to amend the country's 1987 Constitution,
saying the amending might be used as a tool to extend the elected
officials' terms.
</P>
<P>
Estrada, on the other hand, said the Charter changes would
merely remove restriction on foreign investment and denied charges
he might use them to remove a constitutional six-year cap on a
president's term in office.
</P>
<P>
He also maintained that no protests would stop his plan to
amend the constitution.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Property Sector Improves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's property sector
has shown clear signs of recovery in the first half of this year,
but there is still a property overhang, Deputy Finance Minister
Wong See Wah said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The number of transactions in the sector in the first half rose
by 22.2 percent to 110,754 from the 90,645 transactions during the
second half of 1998 and by 15.3 percent from 96,085 transactions
in the first half of 1998, he said while releasing the
January-June 1999 Property Report.
</P>
<P>
The value of property transactions in the first half of 1999
increased by 17.1 percent to 19.94 billion ringgit (about 5.247
billion U.S. dollars) against 14.4 billion ringgit (about 3.789
billion dollars) in the first half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
But there is still a property overhang, Wong said, adding that
the total number of properties unsold was equivalent to 14 percent
of the gross domestic product for 1998.
</P>
<P>
The value of properties yet to be sold up to June this year was
39.25 billion ringgit (about 10.328 billion dollars), of which
36.1 percent were residential properties, 20.3 percent commercial
office space, 7.6 percent shop houses, 34 percent business
complexes and 1.9 percent industrial properties.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister said developers and building owners needed
to overcome the glut in office space, especially in the major
towns of Kuala Lumpur, Shah Alam, Johor Bahru and Pulau Pinang,
with unoccupied office space totaling 2.21 million square meters.
</P>
<P>
Wong expected that the property overhang would be over in about
two years.

<P>
CAIRO, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Egyptian newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- Palestinians and Israelis have made "enough progress" that
makes it probable for them to sign an agreement on the
implementation of the Wye Accord in Egypt on Thursday, said
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa Sunday. But it has not been
decided yet, he added.
</P>
<P>
Israel said Sunday that there is a chance it will sign the
agreement with Palestinians in Egypt this week, to clear the way
for the first handover of West Bank land in eight months.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said that "if a meeting happened in Cairo, it would be
to agree on timetables and ways of carrying out the Wye River
before all parties."
</P>
<P>
Under the Wye Accord, Israel should have pulled out its troops
from another 13 percent of the West Bank by the end of January,
but it suspended the agreement in early December after only
handing over 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Al-Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- Egypt's Central Agency for General Mobilization and
Statistics has said the country's population is to reach 65.879
million in 2001, 73.173 million in 2006, 81.274 million by the
year 2011.
</P>
<P>
Al-Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
-- A total of 43 Arab and foreign countries will participate in
Cairo International Experimental Theater Festival on September
1-11.
</P>
<P>
Up to 56 troupes, including 16 from Arab states, will take part
in the event.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Gazette:
</P>
<P>
-- Official sources at the Central Bank of Egypt admitted to
the shortage of the U.S. dollar supply at the local market.
</P>
<P>
The CBE's confession came when its decision-makers bitterly
criticized banks for their badly-calculated distribution of loans
to investors and businessmen.

<HEADLINE> Festive Mood Builds Up In Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Even though there is still a
month to go before the official 50th anniversary of the founding
of New China, Beijing is already bustling and buzzing with a
festive mood.
</P>
<P>
On October 1, a grand ceremony will be staged in this world
famous city, which boasts a centuries-long history, to mark the
event and intense preparations for a great number of activities
are in full flow.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the capital a massive building and renovation
program, aimed at transforming the city's whole environment, is
now almost complete. Walkways on main streets have been re-paved
and roadsides flanked by decorated lawns, shrubberies and flower
filled gardens.
</P>
<P>
The newly finished pedestrian street of Wangfujing to the east
of Tian'anmen Square and the brand new Xidan cultural plaza to its
west have impressed even the most blase of Beijing's residents and
astonished visitors.
</P>
<P>
Chang'an Avenue, the main boulevard that cuts through the heart
of Beijing, looks especially grandiose with buildings that line
the famous thoroughfare all refurbished. The local government has
also ordered the removal of all advertising hoardings and
commercial neon signs along the main thoroughfare.
</P>
<P>
With the installation of scores of new telephone booths and
garbage collection bins lining the streets, tourists are finding
the whole city very convenient and clean.
</P>
<P>
Jokingly called a "huge construction site" by Li Ka-shing,
chairman of the Hong Kong-based Cheung Kong Holding Company, only
one year ago, Beijing has now blossomed into garden like city, the
envy of Asia and the world.
</P>
<P>
"Beijing is now the most beautiful I have ever seen it," said
Wang Rui, a middle-aged tourist from east China's Anhui Province
who first toured the national capital when he was just six.
</P>
<P>
Over the previous weekend,thousands of people were seen in the
streets trying to familiarise themselves with the much changed
city and the air was full of excitement.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics from the Beijing Municipal People's
Government show that 110 billion yuan have been spent in
constructing 67 major projects planned for the 50 anniversary
celebration event. Twenty of them are now finished and the
remaining ones are expected to be completed before the coming
national day.
</P>
<P>
Among the newly completed major projects are the 335,000 sq m
new modern control tower at Beijing's Capital Airport; the re-
opening after a massive refurbishment of New China's first ever
department store on Wangfujing; the opening of four new major
streets including Ping'an Avenue which is parallel with Chang'an
Avenue; the 7.6 billion-yuan Fuxingmen-Bawangfen subway; the
dredging of 30 rivers and 26 lakes, with a length of 500 km and a
water area of over 600 hectares respectively, as well as the
widespread demolition of illegally constructed and out-dated
houses with a combined floor space of four million sq meters.
</P>
<P>
Lew Baxter, a British journalist who has worked in China for
many years, said he was greatly impressed by Beijing's sweeping
changes.
</P>
<P>
"It is wonderful and they are transforming China's capital into
a world-beating 21st century metropolis," said Baxter
enthusiastically. "And the greening of the city is a masterstroke
which makes it such a pleasant place to visit and live in." he
added. He has already travelled twice along Ping'an Avenue, which
boasts architecture based on the Ming and Qing dynasties, since it
was opened to traffic last Saturday, describing it as an
inspiration which reflects China's marvellous traditional building
styles.
</P>
<P>
He was also very much impressed by the new Xidan Cultural
Plaza, the changes in Wangfujing and near the New Railway Station
in the western Haidian District of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, workers are still busy adding new lighting
facilities on the three-km long north-south axis road from
Zhengyangmen to Zhonggulou so that as evening falls, the lights on
the east-west Chang'an Avenue and that on the Zhengyangmen-
Zhonggulou road can complement each other.
</P>
<P>
"I can hardly recognize Beijing after so many changes," said He
Jinjiang, a worker who used to work at Wangfujing Department Store
for 44 years. "It's my good luck to see Beijing become so
beautiful."

PARIS, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers on Monday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin has admitted for the
first time that the government no longer has the means to impose
its will to the market, because France now has an economy which is
not administered by the government. He made the statement in a
speech to the Socialist Party militants on Sunday in reference to
the failure of a merger plan between the Banque Nationale de Paris
and the Societe Generale, France's two biggest private banks.
</P>
<P>
-- The people of East Timor in Indonesia are pessimistic about
the outcome of the U.N.-sponsored referendum of self-determination
in the former Portuguese colony, which is due to be held on Monday.
The anti-independence militiamen are reigning the province with
terror.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Some 450,000 East Timorese are due to vote on Monday on the
territory's future in a self-determination referendum under the
auspices of the United Nations. The anti-independence militiamen
have promised "a river of blood" if their pro-independence
adversaries carry the vote.
</P>
<P>
-- French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin has fixed "the
reconquest of a society of full employment" as the objective of
the next decade of the government. In a speech addressed on Sunday
to the Socialist militants attending the summer university of the
party in La Rochelle, southwest France, Jospin rejected a demand
by the Greens to reform the method of voting in the 2002
legislative elections, but promised to hold a "scientific and
democratic debate" on the future of the country's nuclear policy.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Chronology on Congo Conflict (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On July 1, 1999, Belligerents attending Lusaka peace talks in
the Congo conflict agreed that a United Nations peace-keeping
force should be sent to the Congo with full mandate from the U.N.
procedures once a cease-fire agreement is signed.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. estimates, the Congo conflict has sucked in
six African countries and has already displaced some 500,000
people inside the Congo and caused up to 200,000 more to flee to
neighboring states.
</P>
<P>
On July 5, Secretary-General of the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) Salim Ahmed Salim said that the conflict in the Congo
will be on the agenda of the 35th OAU Summit in Algerian capital
Algiers from July 12 to 14.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general noted that collective efforts are
required from all OAU member states to put an end to conflicts and
terrorism, which constitute a threat to the stability and security
of states and their peoples.
</P>
<P>
On July 7, Zambian Presidential Affairs Minister Eric Silwamba
said the regional ministers met in Lusaka from June 29 to July 7
to finalize the draft cease-fire agreement on the conflict in the
Congo and the Modalities and Time-table for the implementation of
the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
The ministers and representatives from the 14 Southern African
Development Community (SADC) and the international community
reached agreement on the above mentioned documents and adopted
them unanimously.
</P>
<P>
On July 8, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan expressed his
readiness in a statement to deploy U.N. military observers at an
early date to the Congo ahead of a full-scale U.N. peace-keeping
operation.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General urged the governments and rebel leaders
concerned to sign and ratify the cease-fire agreement as a matter
of urgency and called on them to enact an immediate cease-fire of
hostilities and troops standstill, pending the entry into force of
the pact.
</P>
<P>
On July 10, The long-awaited cease-fire accord to end the
11-month conflict in the Congo was signed at a regional summit
held in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
The agreement calls for a cease-fire 24 hours after the
signing, the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the national
territory of the Congo, cessation of all hostilities, creation of
a new national army, disarmament of all armed groups and
inter-Congolese political negotiations, in which all participants
enjoy equal status.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was officially endorsed by presidents of
Democratic Congo, Namibia, Rwanda, Uganda and Zimbabwe and the
defense minister of Angola.
</P>
<P>
The Congolese rebels did not sign the agreement because of
disagreement over who should represent the rebel Congolese Rally
for Democracy (RCD).
</P>
<P>
On July 11, Congolese rebels of the RCD vowed to fight on,
despite the Lusaka cease-fire pact signed by heads of state of six
countries including Burundi involved in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
On July 12, Zimbabwean Defense Minister Moven Mahachi said the
withdrawal of Zimbabwean troops from the Congo was expected to
start within the next three to four months, following the signing
of the cease-fire agreement in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council urged Congolese rebel leaders to sign
the cease-fire accord as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
On July 15, SADC Task Force headquarters in Kinshasa, capital
of the Congo, charged that the rebels violated cease-fire pact. It
said in some parts of the battlefield, the rebels and their allies
had already started movements which were beginning to threaten
various main supply routes.
</P>
<P>
On July 19, A meeting of military experts which was expected to
 culminate into the establishment of a Joint Military Commission
(JMC) on the Congo failed to start in Lusaka because rebels and
Rwandan officials did not arrive on time.
</P>
<P>
On July 20, The Rwandan government accused Congolese President
Laurent Kabila and his allies of violating the cease-fire
agreement signed in Lusaka. The Congolese forces and its allies in
turn also charged that rebels and their Rwandan backers did not
respected the cease-fire deal and continued to mount attacks on
their positions and cut off some of the supply routes, especially
in eastern Kasai.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, heavy fighting in Zongo in northern Congo,
where clashes between the Congolese Liberation Movement (MLC) of
Jean Pierre Bemba and government troops pushed over 1,000
residents to cross over to the Central African Republic.
</P>
<P>
Defense and foreign ministers from the belligerent countries
set up two bodies -- a ministerial-level committee and the JMC to
implement and supervise a cease-fire to the conflict in the Congo.
</P>
<P>
On July 24, Chairman of the JMC, senior Algerian army general,
Rachid Lalli, arrived in Lusaka. He was appointed by OAU
Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim.
</P>
<P>
Under the Lusaka cease-fire agreement, the JMC will be
responsible for executing peace-keeping operations until the
deployment of the U.N. peace- keeping force.
</P>
<P>
On July 27, The rebel factions of the Congo, after a six-day
meeting in Tanzanian capital Dar Es Salaam, failed to reach an
agreement on who should sign the accord to end conflict in the
Congo.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Chronology on Congo Conflict (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The agreement was signed on July 10 by all six warring
countries involved in the Congo conflict. But the rebel Congolese
Rally for Democracy (CRD) and the MLC did not sign because of
disagreement within CRD over who would sign on behalf of the
group.
</P>
<P>
On August 2, The rival groups within the CRD said they welcome
the signing by the MLC leader. The CRD split into two factions in
May in 1999, into one led by Emile Illunga and the other by Ernest
Wamba Dia Wamba.
</P>
<P>
On August 4, The Congolese government allegedly launched air
raids against two rebel-held fishing towns in the northern part of
the Congo, killing at least 518 people, mostly civilians,
Congolese rebel group MLC leader Jean-Pierre Bemba charged.
</P>
<P>
But the Congolese government denied any link with the bombing
the next day.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan government also condemned the alleged air raids
carried out by Sudanese planes.
</P>
<P>
On August 6, the U.N. Security Council unanimously decided to
authorize the deployment of up to 90 military liaison personnel to
help bring an end to the conflict in the Congo. These military
personnel will have a three- month mandate to establish contacts
and maintain liaison with the JMC and all signatories to the
Lusaka pact.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. hopes to deploy thousands of international troops and
500 military observers to help maintain a cease-fire in the vast
central African nation once all warring parties agree to put down
their guns.
</P>
<P>
On August 7, Zimbabwe said its forces based in the Congo are
not likely to return home before the end of the year as expected.
</P>
<P>
Although the cease-fire is in effect in some part of the
country, some rebels and their allies are violating it, Zimbabwe
charged.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zambia's mediation to end the Congo conflict was
delayed as rival rebel factions in the country fought a gun battle
at the rebel stronghold of Kisangani in northeastern Congo,
preventing a Zambian peace delegation from flying into the jungle
city.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian delegation led by Minister of State House Eric
Silwamba arrived at the Congo in an attempt to persuade the
divided rebel CRD to sign the Lusaka peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
On August 8, a mini-summit on the conflict in the Congo was
held in Pretoria, South Africa. The summit, convened by South
African President Thabo Mbeki, was also attended by Yoweri
Museveni of Uganda and Pasteur Bizimungu of Rwanda and Tanzanian
President Benjamin Mkapa.
</P>
<P>
The presidents discussed the situation in the Congo after the
alleged bombing of the northeastern Congolese city of Kisangani
which has threatened to bring setbacks to the faltering peace
process in the third largest African country.
</P>
<P>
On August 9, Presidents of South Africa, Rwanda, Tanzania and
Uganda agreed that verification process which was agreed upon on
July 10 by leaders of six countries involved in the congolese
crisis should be carried out as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached at the end of the mini-summit on the
crisis of the Congo held in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
On August 14, Parties to the conflict in the Congo agreed to
temporarily lay down arms to make way for the immunization of over
10 million children against polio-myelitis.
</P>
<P>
The three-phase national immunization program will cover the
whole of the war-ravaged country of about 50 million people.
</P>
<P>
On August 15, Some Ugandan soldiers were injured in clashes
with Rwandan troops in Kisangani, the third largest city of the
Congo.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda, who have been backing the rebels in the
Congo, were said to have differences in strategies to be used to
topple Congolese President Kabila.
</P>
<P>
On August 17, Kabila unexpectedly left Maputo for home to deal
with urgent affairs while a celebration ceremony was going on to
mark the 19th Anniversary of the founding of the Southern African
Development Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
Conference sources disclosed that Kabila left because rebel
forces were making advances and posing a serious threat to his
government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.N. Security Council voiced its concern in a
statement at the eruption of fighting in Kisangani between troops
from Rwanda and Uganda and the Congolese rebel factions, and
demanded an immediate end to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
On August 24, A faction of the rebel CRD agreed to reconsider
its position on the Lusaka peace pact aimed at ending the conflict
in the Congo.
</P>
<P>
The CRD faction led by Emile Ilunga agreed to go to its
founding members in the constituencies to decide on the matter.
</P>
<P>
Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, who leads the other CRD faction, has
been persuaded by Uganda to sign the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
A leadership squabble has kept the two factions from signing
the agreement. Wamba dia Wamba, who was ousted as CRD leader in
May, has insisted that he should sign the agreement, but the new
leader, Ilunga, said he would not sign it if Wamba dia Wamba does.
</P>
<P>
Finally, both rebel factions have agreed to sign the Lusaka
peace agreement later this month.
</P>
<P>
The solving of this legitimacy problem has been hailed as the
last chance to rescue the peace deal which risked to derail if the
rebels did not endorse it.
</P>
<P>
On August 28, Zambian minister for Presidential Affairs Eric
Silwamba said the RCD had agreed to come and sign the agreement on
August 31 in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
Delegations from the two RCD factions are in Lusaka Monday,
ready to sign the cease-fire pact set for Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> SADC Defense Pact in Place Next Year: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 30 (Xinhua) -- An umbrella defense pact
covering the whole of southern Africa is to be in place by as
early as next year to ensure lasting peace and stability in the
region, The Star newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is pushing for such a pact, which would allow
troops from neighboring countries in the region to invade each
other in the event of a serious security breakdown or a major
threat to national interests, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Stringent conditions would, however, be laid down before any
country is given permission by the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) heads of state to assist a member state under
threat, the paper quoted defense policy planners as indicating.
</P>
<P>
The planning has been driven by the SADC incursion into Lesotho
last year and the ongoing war in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo which has so far sucked in four SADC member countries and
affected the stability of several others.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the pact is receiving serious attention
from a SADC working party under the chairmanship of Swaziland, and
is expected to be signed by all 14 member states of the SADC by
next year, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
So far, it has the full support of South Africa and Zimbabwe,
the two biggest military powers in the region, the paper added.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland, Mozambique, Botswana and namibia have been actively
lobbied by South Africa over the past few weeks and although not
yet totally committed to it, they are believed to be "very
interested", the paper quoted military sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
South African Defense Minister Patrick Lekota and his deputy,
Nosizwe Madlala-Routledge, both say such a pact would contribute
to "a lasting peace and stability in southern Africa" and they are
pushing hard for acceptance of the idea, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
Lekota said in Harare this week that the new pact would
supersede a defense pact signed earlier this year by Angola,
Namibia, Zimbabwe and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which
led to the three nations sending troops to the Congo to keep
President Laurent Kabila in power. It was this pact that has given
rise to the idea of regional security.
</P>
<P>
None of the conditions which would have to be followed for
incursions into neighboring states have been spelled out as yet as
this is being undertaken by the working party, a defense source
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Lekota said that the defense pact would be different from the
four countries' pact as it would address the security concerns of
the whole region, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
"The situation regarding the military intervention in the Congo
would have been much clearer if the SADC defense protocol, which
would stipulate the circumstances within which inter-state
military intervention should take place, was in place," Lekota
said after meeting his Zimbabwean counterpart, Moven Mahachi.
</P>
<P>
Madlala-Routledge told delegates attending the southern African
air defense symposium in Pretoria last week that the government
supported " collaborative security in southern Africa based on
national security, human security and environmental security.
</P>
<P>
"Peace in terms of this approach means not only the absence of
conflicts but also more importantly the presence of economic
justice and social harmony.
</P>
<P>
"Such an approach is crucial for addressing the cause of inter-
and intro-state conflicts."
</P>
<P>
She added that it was essential for SADC members to work
together in guaranteeing the safety and security of the region's
air space.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's Ready-made Garment Industry Fighting for Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's ready-made garment
industry is fighting a fierce battle for the market quota, both at
home and abroad, sources close to the country's garment industry
has said.
</P>
<P>
Increased imports and smuggling of ready-made clothes have
nearly elbowed Egyptian-made garments out of the local market, the
Egyptian Gazette newspaper quoted the sources as saying on Monday.
</P>
<P>
It seems that cheap second-hand clothes are also more appealing
to Egyptian customers than home-made pieces, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The weaving and textile industry is one of the pillars of the
Egyptian industry.
</P>
<P>
The sources criticized a court ruling which dismissed as
unconstitutional article 75 of the duty and custom law for
endangering the national ready-made garment industry.
</P>
<P>
The article had empowered customs officials to confiscate
smuggled garments and arrest smugglers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Director of the African and Arab Studies Center
Mohssen Qandeel has urged the Egyptian government to intervene to
save the job-creating industry.
</P>
<P>
Qandeel on Sunday proposed that the government investigate the
problems which he said are jeopardizing the strategic industry.
</P>
<P>
The taxation system, the increasing price of power and water
and the rapacity of wholesale traders are largely attributed to
the problems, Qandeel said.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Tariff Plan Unfair: Tanzanian President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The goal of the Common Market
for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) for creating a
zero-tariff zone for all its members is incompatible with
Tanzania's national development agenda, Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa has said.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks Sunday during a stop-over at
Nairobi International Airport to Europe and confirmed his
country's intention to withdraw from COMESA.
</P>
<P>
According to the COMESA summit held last May in Kenya, all the
member states are scheduled to realize the zero tariff to trade by
October 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers Monday quoted Mpaka as saying the zero-tariff
requirement would seriously affect the government revenue and his
country was reluctant to commit itself by such a venture.
</P>
<P>
"Let us get serious and evaluate our plans before implementing
such drastic measures," he pleaded.
</P>
<P>
Mpaka said he hoped other countries would still want to conduct
business with Tanzania despite their decision not remove taxes on
goods from COMESA member countries.
</P>
<P>
He explained that his country decided to pull out because it
was a member of other regional bodies such as Southern Africa
Development Community and the upcoming East Africa Community.
</P>
<P>
It is learnt that other countries which intend to quit COMESA
are Mozambique and Lesotho.

led to the three nations sending troops to the Congo to keep
President Laurent Kabila in power. It was this pact that has given
rise to the idea of regional security.
</P>
<P>
None of the conditions which would have to be followed for
incursions into neighboring states have been spelled out as yet as
this is being undertaken by the working party, a defense source
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Lekota said that the defense pact would be different from the
four countries' pact as it would address the security concerns of
the whole region, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
"The situation regarding the military intervention in the Congo
would have been much clearer if the SADC defense protocol, which
would stipulate the circumstances within which inter-state
military intervention should take place, was in place," Lekota
said after meeting his Zimbabwean counterpart, Moven Mahachi.
</P>
<P>
Madlala-Routledge told delegates attending the southern African
air defense symposium in Pretoria last week that the government
supported " collaborative security in southern Africa based on
national security, human security and environmental security.
</P>
<P>
"Peace in terms of this approach means not only the absence of
conflicts but also more importantly the presence of economic
justice and social harmony.
</P>
<P>
"Such an approach is crucial for addressing the cause of inter-
and intra-state conflicts."
</P>
<P>
She added that it was essential for SADC members to work
together in guaranteeing the safety and security of the region's
air space.

<HEADLINE> Flaw in UNAMET's Autonomy Polling in East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DILI, East Timor, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The absence of
witnesses from both pro- and anti-integration forces in the U.N.
organized autonomy ballot in East Timor Monday was a flaw, said
the chief of East Timorese Front (BRTT).
</P>
<P>
The absence of these witnesses was caused by the late handover
of the namelist of the people assigned to the United Nation
Assessment Mission for East Timor (UNAMET), Lopez Da Cruz said.
</P>
<P>
"All went well, except for one flaw for the absence of
witnesses from pro- and anti-integration that failed to attend,
because of the handing over names, that according to them had
passed the deadline set by UNAMET," he said after casting his vote
in Motael village, West Dili, capital of East Timor, Monday.
</P>
<P>
The delay, according to Lopez, was either caused by both
forces' ignorance, or UNAMET's deadline that was too short.
</P>
<P>
"But for the ballots counting, we will send our witnesses,"
said Lopez.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lopez said intimidation occurred when an UNAMET
staffer was seen to force a voter to vote on anti integration. "In
a polling station in Fumento village, west of Dili, an UNAMET
staffer forced a woman to vote for the National Council for East
Timor Resistance (CNRT) which means rejecting autonomy, but now he
had been apprehended by police and his vehicle license taken,"
said Lopez.
</P>
<P>
But he said the voting is going on normally, judging from
security maintained in the area, and he hoped that no cheating
should ever occur.
</P>
<P>
Polling started at 6:30 a.m. local time to decide the future of
East Timor, a former Portuguese colony which was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976. But the United Nations never recognized the
move.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Weightlifters Aim for 6 Titles at Sydney Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, CHINA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese weightlifters set
their sights on six gold medals at the 2000 Olympic Games in
Sydney, Australia, as officials from the national team disclosed
at the Asian Weightlifting Championships here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Our women lifters, who smashed world records regularly at
international competitions, are keen for the Olympic titles since
the women's weightlifting is introduced into the Olympics for the
first time in the Sydney Olympic Games," said Chinese head coach
Yang Hanxiong.
</P>
<P>
Chinese strongwomen dominated all the world records in the
seven divisions but one snatch world record in the over 75
kilograms class went to Poland's Wrobel Agata who set it in
Svannah on July 8 this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the limit set by International Weightlifting
Association (IWA) that one country can have four women lifters at
most in the Olympic Games, China will focus on four divisions out
of seven.
</P>
<P>
Chinese women's team coach Xi Hanxiang said: "Though we have
not decided yet the roster, we set our target to win three to four
Olympic gold medals in women's competitions."
</P>
<P>
Chinese women will face challenge from South Korea and Myanmar
in the lesser weight classes and rivalry by European countries in
the upper categories in Olympic Games, Xi said.
</P>
<P>
Compared with their women's counterparts, Chinese men face
tougher Olympic prospect.
</P>
<P>
Atlanta Olympic champion Zhan Xugang, 25, had to adjust his
previous 70kg class to 77kg according the new division set by IWA,
and Asian top 105kg-class lifter Cui Wenhua, 24, didn't make
improvement as big as youngsters although he trained as hard.
</P>
<P>
However, head coach Yang expected the men lifters can take one
to two Olympic gold medals.
</P>
<P>
"Our strongmen will try to grab one to two titles while women
hopefully to sweep all the four crowns at the Sydney Olympics," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean President Pledges To Uphold Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe Sunday pledged to uphold the principle of unity which the
late vice- president Joshua Nkomo preached, the daily Herald
reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He promised that Zimbabweans in all the country's regions would
continue to get equal attention from the government.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a memorial service for Nkomo at Ascot Race Course
in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's second largest city, Mugabe said that
although not all of the Vice-President's virtues could be
emulated, the legacy of unity had to be jealously guarded.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no departure from the principle of unity and the
 equitable distribution of resources," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that although the country had various tribal
groupings, tribal divisions were not acceptable as all the groups
were Zimbabwean, as demonstrated by Nkomo's leadership which cut
across tribe and race.
</P>
<P>
"Oneness must be sustained. Our Zimbabwean flag must forever
fly as a symbol of our oneness. We have to love each other and
always remember that no Zimbabwean is greater than the other," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Positions don't make you a greater man than the poor man out
there," he said to applause from about 2,000 people who attended
the service.

</P>
<P>
"According to reports received from several locations, during

<HEADLINE> Thais, Chinese Are Brothers, Sisters: Thai Deputy PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 30 (Xinhua) -- "Thai people and Chinese people
are brothers and sisters, that's what every person in Thailand
thinks. But what do the Chinese people think? I decided to find it
out in my visit to China earlier this year," Korn Dabbaransi, Thai
Deputy Prime Minister and Public Health Minister, told Xinhua a
story during an interview before Chinese President Jiang Zemin's
visit to Thailand this week.
</P>
<P>
"So, when I visited a school in Kunming (capital of China's
southwestern Yunnan province), where Thai language is taught, I
went into a classroom and wrote on the blackboard an incomplete
sentence: 'Chinese and Thais are ...' in Thai," Korn recalled.
</P>
<P>
"I asked who can complete the sentence, and a young boy aged 18
or 19 raised his hand and completed the sentence with the words '
brothers and sisters' in Thai. His answer made me very happy. I'm
pleased to find out that people in China think the same way," Korn
said.
</P>
<P>
As the president of the Thai-Chinese Friendship Association (
TCFA), Korn said he has always supported and encouraged
cooperation between the two countries in various fields, he said.
</P>
<P>
Korn said he is encouraging more Thai people to visit northern
and northeastern parts of China, which are still a new market for
Thai businessmen.
</P>
<P>
As for the southern part of China, Korn said, Thai people
started to travel there as soon as it opened doors to outside
world more than 20 years ago, he said.
</P>
<P>
The first registration certificate of foreign-invested
enterprises in China's Shenzhen Special Economic Zone, the country
's "window of reform and opening-up", went to Thailand's Charoen
Pny in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Apart from trade and economic cooperation, Korn said the TCFA
is also promoting "people-to-people" contact between citizens from
both countries. Being head of the TCFA and Thailand's Badminton
Association, Korn had the privilege to invite Chinese coaches to
come to Thailand and help train Thai players.
</P>
<P>
"Actually, badminton played an important diplomatic role in the
development of Thai-Chinese relations. It became the first bridge
linking the two countries to set up the diplomatic ties," Korn
said.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed that as China continues to develop in a
stable and rapid way, Thailand and China will have even closer
relations. "We should visit each other not as friends, but as
relatives," Korn said.

industrial zones to boost the country's industrial production.
</P>
<P>
It has already set up 17 industrial zones across the country in
an effort to promote the development of the industrial sector.
</P>
<P>
These zones include five in Yangon and one each in Mandalay,
Bago, Hinthada, Myaungmya, Myeik, Yenangyaung, Pyay, Mingyan,
Meiktila, Pathein, Monywa and Mawlamyine.

value of the industrial sector.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the country has also drawn foreign investments in
the infrastructural development of the zones with companies from
Japan, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand building up three zones
out of five in the capital Yangon.

NEW DELHI, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news

The Hindu:

<HEADLINE> The Uzbek: A Successful Ethnic Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Urumqi, August 30 (Xinhua) -- In recent years, villagers in
northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have made a
good living by cultivating cashmere sheep to produce the
comfortable and valuable clothing material.
</P>
<P>
When talking about their fortune, the villagers cannot help
mentioning the name of Yershati Malik, director of a goat research
institution in Urumqi, the regional capital, who has fostered a
new species with a higher yield of quality cashmere.
</P>
<P>
Yershati Malik, now 54, comes from a family of ethnic Uzbek
people who are known for their intelligence. Malik's wife and
eight of his nine brothers and sisters have university degrees,
and all three of his daughters are now at universities.
</P>
<P>
There are nearly 20,000 Uzbeks living in Xinjiang, mostly in
the cities. According to historical records, they are the
descendants of the Uzbek Khan State which was under Mongolian rule
in the 14th century, and their ancestors moved from Central Asia
to Xinjiang in pursuit of trade.
</P>
<P>
Uzbeks, whether in the countryside or the cities, have always
attached great importance to education and are keen on having
their children receive the best education they can. The percentage
of well-educated Uzbek people is officially said to be much higher
than that of most of the 54 ethnic groups in China.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, many Uzbek intellectuals, including teachers,
scientists, and doctors, are making notable progress in their
fields.
</P>
<P>
Mulati Hoga, a 61-year old surgeon with the Regional People's
Hospital, is a good example. During his 43-year career, Hoga has
treated hundreds of thousands of patients.
</P>
<P>
Without the support of the government, he could not have become
a skillful surgeon, Hoga said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Court Rejects Defamation Suit Against PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's High Court
Monday struck out the defamation suit against Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad filed by jailed former deputy prime minister
Anwar Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
In allowing Mahathir's application to strike out the
100-million-ringgit (26 million U.S. dollars) suit, Justice R. K.
Nathan held that the suit was frivolous and vexatious and an abuse
of the process of the court.
</P>
<P>
He granted the defendant's application and ordered the suit be
struck out under the Rules of the High Court and the inherent
jurisdiction of the court.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, who was sacked as the deputy prime minister in September
last year and sentenced in April this year to 6 years'
imprisonment on conviction of corruption charges, filed the suit
on January 25 this year. He claimed that the prime minister had
falsely and maliciously spoken to local and foreign reporters at a
news conference at the Prime Minister's Department accusing him of
committing immoral act.
</P>
<P>
In his statement of defense filed on March 22, Mahathir
contended that he spoke the words as prime minister on an occasion
of qualified privilege, adding that the words were published in
the course of discussion of government and political matters which
concern Anwar in relation to his suitability for the office he
held and after due inquiry and investigation into the matter.
</P>
<P>
Nathan said in his 25-page judgment that having considered all
the issues raised by both parties, he had no hesitation in
concluding that Anwar's claims were "obviously unsustainable."

<HEADLINE> Philippoussis Pulls out of U.S. Open with K nee Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Less than a year after
reaching the final of the U.S. Open, Australia's Mark
Philippoussis withdrew from tennis' final Grand Slam of the year
with a left knee injury, tournament officials announced today in
New York.
</P>
<P>
Phiippoussis suffered the injury during his quarterfinal match
against Pete Sampras in Wimbledon in June. After resting for about
six weeks, he returned at the RCA Championships two weeks ago but
lost to Frenchman Arnaud Di Pasquale in the second round after
receiving a first-round bye.
</P>
<P>
Still feeling pain in his knee, Philippoussis pulled out of
this week's Hamlet Cup in Long Island. He will be unable to play
at Flushing Meadow, where last year he reached a Grand Slam final
for the first in his career, losing to countryman Patrick Rafter.
</P>
<P>
Phiippoussis was seeded No. 11 at the U.S. Open. Spain's Felix
Mantilla becomes the 17th seed and will take Philippoussis' spot
in the draw, opening against Sweden's Magnus Norman.
</P>
<P>
In the first all-Australian U.S. Open men's final since 1970,
Rafter beat Philippoussis 6-3, 3-6, 6-2, 6-0 to defend his title.
</P>
<P>
Philippoussis has won two tournaments this season, both on hard
courts and currently is ranked No. 11 in the world.

WASHINGTON, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Magnus Norman of Sweden tied
Pete Sampras for the lead in ATP Tour victories today, capturing
his fourth title of the year with a 7-6 (7-4), 4-6, 6-3 win over
second-seeded Alex Corretja of Spain at $325,000 Hamlet Cup in New
York.
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old Norman became the first Swede to win here since
Stefan Edberg in 1990. He also has won titles this season at
Orlando, Florida; Stuttgart, Germany, and Umag, Croatia.
</P>
<P>
Norman will face Spain's Felix Mantilla in the first round of
the U.S. Open, which starts Monday.
</P>
<P>
With his sixth career win, Norman will move from 34th to 26th
when the new rankings are released Monday. He also takes home $46,
000 after winning his first career title on a hard surface.
</P>
<P>
In a match that featured 10 breaks of serve, Norman made the
decisive one in the sixth game of the third set, Corretja held off
two break points but the unseeded Norman converted on the third
with a high backhand volley.
</P>
<P>
Norman committed 60 unforced errors but converted 37-of-47
approaches to the net.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Pete Sampras may be the
favorite to win the U.S. Open, but if his first-round opponent
plays like he did this week, it may be an early exit for the world
's No. 1 player.
</P>
<P>
Just two days before his clash with Sampras, Russian teenager
Marat Safin captured his first career ATP Tour title today by
getting past top seed Greg Rusedski of Britain 6-4, 7-6 (13-11) in
the final of the $325,000 MFS Pro Championships in Massachusetts,
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Seeded sixth, the 19-year-old Safin dropped only one set all
week as he became the 12th first-time winner on the ATP Tour this
year.
</P>
<P>
"It feels great to win the title," Safin said. "I was very
nervous and I couldn't put one ball in during the warmup. But I
served very well today, avery good percentage."
</P>
<P>
Safin saved two set points in the second-set tiebreak and
failed to capitalize on five match points before finally closing
out Rusedski on his sixth championship point.
</P>
<P>
The Russian fired 16 aces past the hard-serving Rusedski and
never faced a break point. He alos won 86 percent (36-of-42) of
points on his first serve.
</P>
<P>
Safin will move up two spots to No. 31 in the world when the
new rankings are released on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Safin will face Sampras on Tuesday in a rematch of last year's
four-round match at the U.S. Open, which Sampras won 6-4, 6-3, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to win, but now I have to play Sampras and that's
not so nice," Safin said.

<HEADLINE> Chain Pharmacy Plays Leading Role in U.S. Drug Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Total retail prescription
drug sales in the United States for 1999 are expected to exceed a
record of 121 billion U.S. dollars, according to a report released
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Chain community pharmacy will account for nearly 63 percent of
these sales and will exceed 76.6 billion dollars, up 22.6 percent
from 1998, said the report from the National Association of Chain
Drug Stores.
</P>
<P>
The chain pharmacy industry continues to fill a key role in the
U.S. healthcare system as an easily accessible source of
healthcare services and products, the association said.
</P>
<P>
There are approximately 31,000 chain owned and operated
community pharmacies in the United States, including 19,000
traditional chain drug stores, 7,000 supermarket pharmacies and 5,
000 mass merchant pharmacies.
</P>
<P>
Prescriptions are expected to reach almost three billion by the
end of the year. Of these, chain pharmacies are expected to
dispense 1.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
According to the association, major factors contributing to the
rising prescription volume are the increasing utilization of
prescription drugs, especially by the elderly, and the
introduction of new medicines that enable treatment of more
serious illnesses outside the hospital setting.

<HEADLINE> Firefighters Contain Major Fires in U.S. West States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. firefighters managed to
contain major fires in California and other west states on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The best news is that we're very slowly getting containment
around most of the fires," said Alleah Haley, a fire information
officer for the California Department of Forestry in Butte County.
</P>
<P>
"The bad news is that we're expecting 20-30 mph winds. We are
holding all our resources, hoping for the best and being prepared
for the worst," Haley said.
</P>
<P>
In northern and central California, where Governor Gray Davis
this week declared fire emergencies in four counties, several of
the most severe fires were coming close to containment.
</P>
<P>
With major northern California blazes mostly in hand, attention
shifted to the southern part of the state, where three major new
blazes flared Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Firefighters also reported progress battling a string of blazes
in Nevada, Oregon and Texas. The week-long wildfires across the
western United States have so far consumed almost a quarter of a
million acres of forests and grass, more than 110,000 acres in
California.
</P>
<P>
Officials said Sunday that there were 23 large fires burning in
California, Oregon, Utah and Texas, covering a total of 247,755
acres. Nearly 12,000 firefighters are battling blazes throughout
the West, aided by 797 fire engines, 127 helicopters, 21 air
tankers and 2,616 support workers.
</P>
<P>
As the major blazes were coming under control, the National
Fire Information Center said firefighting resources were being
redeployed as the focus of attention shifted.

<P>
BEIJING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The grand celebrations in China'
s capital of Beijing for the 50th anniversary of the founding of
the People's Republic of China will be broadcast on  China
Central Television (CCTV), the national TV station, with both high
definition and regular TV signals.
</P>
<P>
"The changes are extremely tremendous," said 83-year-old
photographer Xu Xiaobing. When Xu shot the founding ceremony of
New China 50 years ago, he worked with a hand-held camera and
black-and-white films.
</P>
<P>
"We did not have televisions at that time," Xu recalled, "
people listened to the ceremonies via live radio broadcasts."
</P>
<P>
The memories of some 300,000 people who took part in the
founding ceremony in Beijing were fragmentary and unshareable, and
most people only got to see the grand ceremony when a documentary
film was released months later.
</P>
<P>
Today, a Tibetan grandmother living in the Qinghai-Tibet
Plateau, and a frontier soldier in China's northernmost town of
Mohe, will be able to simultaneously watch the October 1
celebrations in Beijing when they turn on their TV sets.
</P>
<P>
China's first TV station, Beijing Television Station, the
predecessor of CCTV, was established on May 1, 1958, and at that
time broadcast only twice a week, three hours each time.
Chairman Mao Zedong was so fond of watching TV that he wrote the
calligraphic name for the TV station.
</P>
<P>
However, at that time only some 30 TV sets produced in the
former Soviet Union could receive the programs in China, and the
number of television audience was counted by hundreds.

<P>
Forty years later, there are 374 TV stations in China, and the
program listings for a single day would cover an entire page of a
newspaper. And many stations now broadcast 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 89.01 percent of China's 1.2 billion
people now have access to TV. The State Administration of Radio,
Film and Television is required to help all villages gain access
to TV by next year--2000.
</P>
<P>
 Before the adoption of satellite transmission, TV viewers in
Beijing and those in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region which is
thousands of miles away from the capital, would have a one-week
lag in viewing prime-time news report on CCTV. In other words, the
news stories watched by people in Xinjiang were one-week old when
they finally got to view them.
</P>
<P>
Currently, 28 satellite transmitters are beaming TV programs
for both national and provincial TV stations, and so the "time
zones" have disappeared, as people are now able to select the
programs of more than 30 provincial TV stations across the country.
</P>
<P>
This diversity has led to intensive competition among TV
stations which often results in better programming for everyone.
</P>
<P>
In China's commercial center of Shanghai, the Shanghai Cable TV
Network is now linked to the Internet, and will soon be able to
transmit programs over more than 300 channels, and offer services
such as digital TV programs, programs on request, long-distance
education, and commercial information.
</P>
<P>
People in China can now look forward to the day when they turn
on their TV and enter a veritable supermarket of TV programs. And
that day is not far away.

HAIKOU, August 30 (Xinhua) -- A civil servant in Hainan
Province was sentenced to life imprisonment here this morning by
the Hainan Provincial Higher People's Court for stealing secrets
and providing them to an overseas agency.
</P>
<P>
Xi Shiguo, assistant researcher at the General Office of the
Hainan Provincial People's Government in south China, was also

</P>
<P>
The Higher Court found that from July 1996 to March 1997, Xi
stole and provided to an overseas intelligence agency nearly 100
classified and other internal documents related to politics,
economy, and national security.
</P>
<P>
Xi received 4,300 U.S. dollars, 140,000 Taiwan dollars, 6,600
yuan (about 800 U.S. dollars) and other things and benefits from
the overseas agency for his espionage, according to the court.
</P>
<P>
In March 1997, Xi was tracked down and arrested by the province
's State security department.
</P>
<P>
The Intermediate People's Court of Hainan ruled after his trial
that as a civil servant, Xi had committed grave crimes and
severely damaged national security and interests. Two months ago,
this court held an open trial of Xi's case.

Prior to the trial, Xi had been expelled from the Communist

</P>
<P>
This espionage case has exposed serious problems in secret
protection and management at the general office of the provincial
government of Hainan.
</P>
<P>
A joint team from the Central Commission for Discipline
Inspection, the Ministry of Public Security, Ministry of State
Security, and other ministries and departments was sent here to
investigate the case.
</P>
<P>
Lin Kechang, deputy secretary-general of the provincial
government, has been removed from his posts within both the Party

<P>
Seven other government officials have also been disciplined by
the province's commission for discipline inspection and the
department of supervision.
</P>
<P>
"This case tells us that while we're engaged in peaceful
construction, overseas intelligence agencies are waging rampant
secret-stealing against us," said one official at the National
Administration for the Protection of State Secrets.
</P>
<P>
People in all Party and government departments, especially
leading officials, should learn from this case, and maintain high
vigilance to ensure the security of state secrets and the smooth
progress of the country's reform and opening and modernization
drive, the official stressed.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 30 (Xinhua)-- Tang Ying's world is absolutely
still, but full of hope as he sits in a computer lab at Shanghai's
Jiaotong University and exchanges ideas with his classmates in a
low voice.
</P>
<P>
No one would notice that he isn't like the other students. In
fact, he's deaf. But he is also the first deaf person to earn a Ph.
D. in China.
</P>
<P>
Tang was born in 1971 in east China's Jiangxi province and lost
his hearing in an accident when he was a child. People assumed
that he had little hope of finishing primary school, let alone
university.
</P>
<P>
The poor boy could speak but couldn't get feedback directly
from others and communication with teachers and classmates was
confined to the use of a pen.
</P>
<P>
He said that his failure to make it to Grade Two left him
depressed and he was discriminated against -- but it didn't get
him down.
</P>
<P>
Then, fortunately, things took a turn for the better the next
year when he met a very kind teacher who gave him care and
encouragement and changed his attitude toward life.
</P>
<P>
Eventually he was able to make it to Nanchang University, but
at first found it very difficult to keep up with other students.
But, with the help of teachers and classmates he succeeded and to
many people's surprise, he not only kept up but got a scholarship
every year and won some of the highest honors at the university. (

<HEADLINE> East Timorese Go to Polls in Autonomy Ballot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DILI, East Timor, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The United
Nations-organized autonomy ballot to determine the future of East
Timor went ahead on Monday as scheduled despite violence which had
left at least eight people dead in the last four days.
</P>
<P>
People started queuing in front of polling stations after 06:15
a.m. local time just before polling officially began at 06:30
(2230 GMT Sunday).
</P>
<P>
Streets of Dili were crowded by citizens walking towards
polling stations to take part in the polling that will determine
the future of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the city itself was quiet as public transportation
such as bus, minibus and taxi was seen unoperational.
</P>
<P>
More than 451,000 people out of 800,000 in East Timor are
eligible to vote in the ballot.
</P>
<P>
For the voting day which is scheduled to close at 05:00 p.m.
local time (0900 GMT), the U.N. Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) has
set up 850 polling stations in East Timor's 13 districts. Each
station is expected to serve about 600 voters.
</P>
<P>
Besides East Timor, 13 cities, including Jakarta, Yogyakarta,
Surabaya, Bali and Ujungpandang, have been chosen by the United
Nations as the sites of polling for East Timorese living outside
the territory.
</P>
<P>
Outside the country, the United Nations has opened polling
stations in Lisbon (Portugal), New York, Macao, Maputo
(Mozambique) and four in Australia.
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement signed by the United Nations,
Indonesia and Portugal on May 5 this year, the Indonesian
government has deployed about 20,000 policemen and security
personnel to safeguard the process of polling. Meanwhile, apart
from 1,600 independent observers from several countries, there are
also 100 official observers from Indonesia and Portugal monitoring
the ballot.
</P>
<P>
In a nationally-televised speech on Sunday night, Indonesian
President B.J. Habibie called on the East Timorese to stay part of
Indonesia and vote with their conscience.
</P>
<P>
"Let's as one big family build a brighter future together, and
please tell the others not to waste the offered wide-ranging
autonomy," Habibie said.
</P>
<P>
The offer was announced early this year as an option to resolve
the protracted issue of the former Portuguese colony. If the
autonomy offer is rejected, the Indonesian government will propose
to the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) to release East Timor
as a separate nation.
</P>
<P>
The former Portuguese colony of East Timor was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976 in a move never recognized by the United
Nations, which still considers Portugal as the administering power
of the territory.
</P>
<P>
UNAMET spokesman David Wimhurst said the vote count will be
centralized in Dili and the results would be announced one week
after the ballot.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Will Never Abandon Kosovo: Army Officer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The Federation of Yugoslavia
and Serbia will never give up Kosovo, a Yugoslav army commander
said in Loznica in western Serbia on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Srboljub Trajkovic, Commander of the first army group of
Yugoslavia, later attended a memorial ceremony near Loznica to
mark the 85th anniversary of Serbia's victory of the Cer War
during World War I, the Tanjug news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Trajkovic said that what the international peacekeeping forces
in Kosovo were doing has made the terrorist activities and ethnic
cleansing by the illegal ethnic Albanian "Kosovo Liberation Army"
more rampant.
</P>
<P>
If the United Nations could not fully carry out its
responsibility, "we will return to Kosovo," the army commander
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Federation of Yugoslavia will do its utmost to let its army,
police and customs agencies return to Kosovo, which he said is a
way to press the international peacekeeping forces to fully
observe the agreement signed between NATO and Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics released by Yugoslavia, more
than 200 Serbs have been killed so far, with over 400 injured and
over 200,000 forced out of home, since the international
peacekeeping forces entered Kosovo two months ago, said the report.

<P>
Surprisingly, he passed the band 6 College English Test quickly
when he was a sophomore, in spite of the impossibilities of the
listening part and was the first deaf student in China to pass the
test.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not someone who readily admits defeat," he said simply.
</P>
<P>
He always "listened" to teachers by carefully watching their
mouths and gestures to try to catch their meaning. For his 20th
birthday, his parents came down to see him but couldn't find him
in the dormitory or elsewhere on campus. They finally found him
studying in a corner of a classroom. His mother burst into tears.
</P>
<P>
Tang was rewarded for his efforts. In 1994, he was enrolled as
a graduate student in an M.A. program at Nanchang University
because of excellent grades. Three years later he was approved for
a Ph.D. program at Jiaotong Univeristy.
</P>
<P>
He said he wanted to use computers to help others, especially
the disabled and he prefers making friends on the Internet. But,
he is also fond of basketball, table tennis, and other sports and
in July represented China at the World Deaf Alliance Convention in
Australia.
</P>
<P>
He said that if he can become a university instructor, he will
try to help more deaf students enter university and if he can
become a software engineer, he will try to design more software
for use by disabled people, and if he can be a member of the
Alliance, he will do more.
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps I am a nobody among thousands of people earning Ph.D.s,
" he said, "but I think I am a somebody among the disabled people,
especially among the deaf, and I am sure that I will play an
important role in helping all people with disabilities," Tang says.

<HEADLINE> China, Great Ally of Developing Nations: LAES Permanent Secretary ( I) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, August 30 (Xinhua) -- China is a great ally of
developing nations and Latin American countries look forward to
further strengthening their friendly ties and economic cooperation
with China, said Juan Carlos Moneta, permanent secretary of the
Latin American Economic System (LAES), in an interview with Xinhua
prior to the 50th anniversary of the People's Republic of China on
October 1.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1975 and with headquarters in the Venezuelan
capital Caracas, the LAES is responsible for internal coordination
between Latin American nations and protection of these nations'
interests. By 1996 it had 27 member countries.
</P>
<P>
"China is playing a leading role in various international
forums such as the United Nations, and it will continue to assume
a vital role in the multi-polar world to come," the LAES permanent
secretary said.
</P>
<P>
The 60-year-old Moneta, who is an Argentine and assumed the
current office in 1995, has paid six visits to China in the past
two decades, the latest of which was in June this year. He said
China "has left an extremely beautiful impression" on him.
</P>
<P>
"Earth-shaking changes have taken place in China in the past
half century, especially over the past 20 years, since China
launched its reform and opening-up drive," said Moneta. "When I
first visited China in the early 1980s, there weren't many goods
in the stores; but during my recent visits, I found that
everything was in large supply in the market and life in China was
as easy as that in the Western countries."
</P>
<P>
In Moneta's opinion, the major reason for China's economic
success lies in the fact that the country has adopted a
development path with its own characteristics and has always
depended on its own efforts in seeking prosperity.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the negative impact of the Asian financial crisis,
China managed to score a remarkable 7.8 percent economic growth
last year. With its financial and state sectors undergoing further
reforms, I believe China will maintain its current momentum of
advancement," Moneta said.
</P>
<P>
Other developing nations in the world must learn from China in
their attempt to develop national economy and achieve
modernization, he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that it is impossible for the entire world to adopt
only one political and economic policy, and that the existence of
differences will help different countries to preserve their own
culture, values and way of life.
</P>
<P>
"With its distinct political and economic mode, China will
naturally serve as an important pole in the future multi-polar
world, and it will secure its status as a world power in the next
10 years," he predicted.

<TEXT>
<P>
The LAES permanent secretary described the current relations
between China and Latin American countries as "quite good," but he
said that such relationships still remain in their "infancy" and
need further development.
</P>
<P>
"For example, the trade volume between China and Latin American
countries now stands at some 8 billion U.S. dollars, which
accounts for a very small share of the overall foreign trade
volumes of both China and Latin America," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that China and Latin American countries both make
greater efforts to improve mutual understanding, further develop
their bilateral relations and seek new ways of cooperation, such
as making investments on each other's soil.
</P>
<P>
Moneta said he was "quite satisfied" with the cooperation and
exchange between the LAES and relevant departments in China, which
started some three years ago when the LAES and the China Council
for the Promotion of International Trade signed an agreement for
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Under that agreement, Moneta said, the LAES and the China
Council for the Promotion of International Trade jointly hosted a
symposium on Sino-Latin American trade in China last June, which
turned out to be a great success. Meanwhile, the LAES has decided
to invite China and some other Asian countries to participate in
the next LAES session in Chile.
</P>
<P>
"There are broad prospects for the further development of the
relationship between China and the LAES," Moneta concluded.

<HEADLINE> Safe Start at Autonomy Polling in East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DILI, East Timor, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Autonomy polling
started safely at certain locations in Dili, capital of East Timor
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Streets of Dili were crowded by citizens walking to polling
stations to take part in the ballot that will determine the future
of the territory.
</P>
<P>
Some voters interviewed by Xinhua showed earnest enthusiasm for
the voting, saying they came to the polling stations early on
Monday morning and were waiting patiently in line before polling
officially began on 06:30 a.m. (2230 GMT Sunday).
</P>
<P>
Two voters, Miru Araujo and Pier Freitas, said they had just
finished polling at the Farol village, so did Jaime Guterres and
his family at the Scout Movement polling station. They cast
ballots at around 06:45-07:00 a.m. local time. Polling is to close
at 17:00 p.m. (0900 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Voting was seen going on smoothly and a sense of security could
be read on the faces of many voters in long queues, despite the
pre-polling violence that claimed some lives.
</P>
<P>
The direct autonomy ballot will determine whether East Timor, a
former Portuguese colony, will enjoy wide-ranging autonomy within
Indonesia or get independence. East Timor integrated into
Indonesia 1976, but the move was never recognized the U.N.

<HEADLINE> E.Timor Polls Open, People Queuing at Polling Stations in Dili </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DILI, August 30 (Xinhua) -- East Timorese began voting on
Monday in a direct autonomy ballot People to decide the
territory's future.
</P>
<P>
In Dili, capital of East Timor, people started queuing in front
of polling stations, though sporadic gun shots were heard at some
places in Dili overnight.
</P>
<P>
Through Xinhua's observation in several locations in Dili,
people were seen in long queues since 06:15 a.m. (local time) just
before polling officially began at 6:30 a.m. (2230 GMT Sunday).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the city itself was quiet from traffic. Public
transportation such as bus, minibus and taxi was seen
unoperational.
</P>
<P>
People were seen walking to each nearest polling station neatly
and the situation was quite normal although at some locations
there were flames, the cause of which was unknown.
</P>
<P>
Some 450,000 people out of 800,000 in the territory are
eligible to vote to determine the future of East Timor through a
U.N.-supervised autonomy ballot.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, integrated into
Indonesia in 1976, but the move was never recognized by the United
Nations. The Indonesian government proposed in January this year
to allow the territory to enjoy a wide-ranging autonomy. If the
offer was rejected by the majority of the East Timorese people,
the territory could become independent.

<HEADLINE> URGENT: East Timor's Autonomy Ballot Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DILI, East Timor, August 30 (Xinhua) -- East Timorese people
began to cast ballots on Monday in a direct autonomy ballot to
decide the territory's future.
</P>
<P>
A total of 451,796 East Timorese people -- 438,517 in East
Timor and 13,279 outside the territory, including overseas -- had
registered for the autonomy ballot.
</P>
<P>
The polling stations opened at 06:30 a.m. (2230 GMT Sunday) and
are to close at 17:00 p.m. (0900 GMT). The United Nations will
announce simultaneously the voting result in New York and Dili
about one week after the ballot.
</P>
<P>
The former Portuguese colony of East Timor was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976 in a move never recognized by the U.N., which
still considers Portugal as the administering power of the
territory.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia early this year announced it would grant East Timor
independence if the people in the territory reject the Indonesia's
offer of a wide-ranging autonomy.

<P>
DILI, East Timor, August 30 (Xinhua) -- A direct ballot is to
be held in East Timor on August 30 to determine whether that
former Portuguese colony will stay within Indonesia enjoying
wide-ranging autonomy or become independent.
</P>
<P>
The following are some basic facts and figures about East
Timor:
</P>
<P>
Area: About 15,000 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Location: Situated in the east of Nusa Tenggara Islands of
Southeast Asia, bounded by West Timor of Indonesia to the west,
the Timor Sea to the south and the Banda Sea to the north.
</P>
<P>
Population: 800,000 (estimated), mostly descendants of Malays
and Papuans.
</P>
<P>
Language: There are 12 local languages which can be further
divided into 35 dialects or sub-dialects. But now all East
Timorese are fluent in Bahasa Indonesian.
</P>
<P>
Religious Followers: Roman Catholics (91.4 percent),
Protestants (2.6 percent), Muslims (0.79 percent), Hindus (0.68
percent), Buddhists (0.1 percent).
</P>
<P>
Capital: Dili (population 100,000).
</P>
<P>
Economy: In the past 20 years, economic growth averaged at
about 10 percent. Its per capita income is about 200 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Polling time: From 06:30 (2230 GMT on August 29) till 17:00
(0900 GMT)
</P>
<P>
Ballot stations: 850
</P>
<P>
Registered voters: 451,796
</P>
<P>
Brief history: East Timor was reduced to a Portuguese colony in
the 16th century and had stayed that way for more than 400 years.
In 1975 the Portuguese government proclaimed that a referendum
would be held in East Timor for the right of self-determination of
the East Timorese people and in the same year Portugal withdrew
from East Timor.
</P>
<P>
In July 1976, Indonesia declared East Timor as its 27th
province, but the United Nations never recognized the move. Since
then, East Timor autonomy has been a solution to the long-standing
issue between Portugal and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
In February 1983, the U.N. Commission on Human Rights adopted a
resolution affirming East Timor's right to independence and
self-determination. Negotiations between Indonesia and Portugal
under the U.N. auspices have been intensified since 1998.
</P>
<P>
On January 27, 1999, the Indonesian government announced that
it is ready to release East Timor if the alternative to wider
autonomy is refused by the people in the region and the
international community. On May 5, Indonesia and Portugal signed
pacts on a poll to determine the future of East Timor and the U.N.
Security Council endorsed the pacts for a special autonomy of East
Timor on May 7. On June 11, the U.N. Security Council decided to
set up a U.N. Mission in East Timor to be responsible for a
referendum of the East Timorese people.

<TEXT>
<P>
DILI, East Timor, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The East Timorese
people will cast their vote in the direct autonomy ballot
scheduled for August 30. The following is a chronology of the East
Timor issue:
</P>
<P>
East Timor, with an area of about 15,000 square kilometers and
a population of 800,000, had been a Portuguese colony for more
than 400 years before 1975.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian troops invaded East Timor on December 7, 1975, after
the departure of the Portuguese and annexed the territory the
following year.
</P>
<P>
Since its incorporation into Indonesia, East Timor has been an
intractable problem and the Portuguese and the international
community including the United Nations have never recognized the
move.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to regain control over the disputed territory,
the government of Portugal brought the matter before the U.N.
General Assembly demanding the withdrawal of the Indonesian forces
from East Timor. The issue was lively debated in this multilateral
forum from 1975 to 1982. However, the deliberations of the issue
were temporarily suspended in 1983 when the U.N. secretary-general
managed to institute a "tripartite dialogue," a forum in which
Indonesia and Portugal under the auspices of the U.N.
secretary-general engaged in a direct negotiation over the issue.
</P>
<P>
A series of serious negotiations have accordingly been
conducted within the framework of the tripartite dialogue,
attempting to settle once and for all the final status of the
disputed territory. Unfortunately, these exercises have proven to
be futile.
</P>
<P>
It was only after the fall of the former Indonesian President
Soeharto in May 1998 that Indonesia has been able to be more
forthcoming by proposing a wide-ranging autonomy to East Timor as
an end solution to the problem.
</P>
<P>
On May 5, 1999, Indonesia, Portugal and the United Nations
agreed to conduct a direct polling to ascertain the wish of the
majority of the East Timorese on the proposal. Basically, it
offers a window of opportunity for the people of East Timor to
remain as an integral part of Indonesia while giving them the
freedom to administer their internal affairs free from the central
government's interference. The Indonesian government has even
offered another option that would enable East Timor to secede
honorably and peacefully from Indonesia, if and when the majority
of the East Timorese people reject the autonomy package.

... if and when the Timorese people reject the autonomy
package.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately indeed, a breakthrough was achieved when Indonesia
and Portugal under the auspices of the U.N. secretary general
signed an agreement on the autonomy package on May 5, 1999, which
hopefully will solve the East Timor question once and for all
through the holding of a popular consultation.
</P>
<P>
As a neutral and independent third party, the United Nations
would conduct this consultation aimed at ascertaining the views of
the East Timorese inside and outside the territory on whether they
would accept or reject the autonomy proposal. The government of
Indonesia is responsible for maintaining security with the U.N.
Civilian Police acting as adviser.
</P>
<P>
Following the May 5, 1999 New York agreements, the parties to
the agreements initially agreed to organize the event on August 5,
1999. Due to logistical and security reasons, however, the
balloting had been rescheduled a number of times. Finally, the
U.N. secretary general announced that the poll will take place on
August 30, 1999. And then the United Nations sent its Mission to
East Timor (UNAMET) and the Indonesian government dispatched
approximately 8,000 police personnel to the region.
</P>
<P>
From July 16 to August 6, 451,796 people inside and outside
East Timor had registered for the direct ballot. The figure
exceeds the initial estimate of 400,000.
</P>
<P>
On August 14, the campaign started and it will end on August
27. But the campaign has been marred by several clashes between
the rival factions, leaving at least five people dead and many
others injured. The mounting tension in some districts has also
forced about 3,000 local people to take refuge in churches.
</P>
<P>
August 28 and 29 will be a two-day cooling period before the
direct ballot.
