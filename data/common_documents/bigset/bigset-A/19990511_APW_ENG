<HEADLINE> Paper: China Had Details on US Nukes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- China had significant details of several  
classified U.S. nuclear warheads -- everything from the weight and 
accuracy to sketches of the re-entry vehicles -- more than a decade 
ago, The Los Angeles Times reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1988 Chinese military document, obtained by the CIA in 1995,  
is key to current investigations into admitted security breaches at 
U.S. security installations. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials who have seen the classified material told the  
newspaper that it doesn't contain sufficient information for 
Beijing to copy or construct American-style nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Knowing the dimensions and the size doesn't tell you how to  
build a nuclear weapon,'' the Times quoted an unidentified official 
as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 10 congressional committees are looking into how the  
Clinton administration responded to allegations of lax security at 
weapons labs and the discovery in 1996 of a major theft of secrets 
by China at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly all the nuclear weapons on the 1988 document were  
developed and built at Los Alamos, The Times reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times, citing U.S. intelligence officials it did not  
identify, said the Chinese-language document included a chart with 
data on six U.S. weapons, including the most sophisticated -- the 
W-87, which has 10 independently targeted warheads in a re-entry 
vehicle and is used in the MX Peacekeeper missile. 
</P>
<P>
	The document also mentioned the eight-warhead W-88, used on  
Trident submarines, and the W-78, a three-warhead system used in 
Minuteman III missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	Three other systems, the W-56, W-67 and W-72, date to the 1960s  
and 1970s and are no longer deployed. 
</P>
<P>
	The document -- not blueprints, according to The Times -- included  
projections, in yards, of each missile's accuracy as well as 
hand-drawn sketches of the re-entry vehicles with the dimensions of 
the nose cones. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the details, though officially classified, have been  
published in U.S. books and magazines but others remain top secret.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Money Pours Into Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Foreign companies are pouring more money into Japan  
than ever before as it deregulates its financial services industry 
and land prices continue to fall, a newspaper reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Direct foreign investment in Japan for the first eleven months  
of fiscal 1998 rose to a record high 1.08 trillion yen ($8.93 
billion), an increase of 107 percent from the year earlier, the 
Nihon Keizai newspaper reported, quoting the Finance Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
	The figure was well above the previous record for a full fiscal  
year of 770 billion yen ($6.37 billion), invested in fiscal 1996, 
the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Ministry spokesman Toshiyuki Kawabata said the  
government could not comment on the report as the full figures for 
fiscal 1998, which ended March 31, have not yet been compiled. 
</P>
<P>
	The surge in foreign investment has been fueled by Japan's ``Big  
Bang'' deregulation measures, which have made it easier for 
overseas companies to take stakes in Japanese insurers and other 
financial institutions, the Nihon Keizai said. 
</P>
<P>
	American companies like Merrill Lynch and GE Capital have been  
aggressively picking up the pieces of failed Japanese financial 
services firms at bargain prices. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the ongoing deterioration of land prices in  
Japan has spurred interest in the country's real estate market. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, many Japanese firms that have been weakened by the  
protracted economic slump are looking to companies abroad for 
financial and managerial assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nihon Keizai said foreign direct investment is expected to  
climb even higher this fiscal year, which ends in March 2000.

<HEADLINE> Gov't. Issues Railroad Safety Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government has released its first  
comprehensive list of federal passenger railroad standards. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules, released Monday by the Federal Railroad  
Administration, spell out a variety of safety requirements that 
will have to be met by Amtrak, commuter railroads and other 
short-haul operators in metropolitan and suburban areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those exempted are subway systems, while different rules  
will be crafted for tourist, excursion and historic railroads. 
</P>
<P>
	To date passenger railroads have operated under a loose knit set  
of federal rules. In many respects, they have been responsible for 
establishing their own safety standards. 
</P>
<P>
	The new rules:  
</P>
<P>
	--Establish comprehensive structural standards for passenger rail  
equipment, including the type of crash impact that cars must 
withstand. 
</P>
<P>
	--Enhance fire standards.  
</P>
<P>
	--Outline specific requirements for passenger car emergency  
escapes. 
</P>
<P>
	--Set standards for the inspection and testing of a car's  
mechanical components. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1984, the railroad administration issued guidelines  
recommending test methods and performance standards for 
flammability and smoke emission characteristics of materials in 
passenger cars. Updated in 1989, the guidelines have been followed 
on a voluntary basis by passenger railroads. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on Monday's announcement, they will now become law.  
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak, the nation's only intercity passenger railroad, withheld  
immediate comment on the new rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just got this, so there are a number of areas we have to  
look into in terms of the impact it will have on Amtrak,'' said 
spokesman John Wolf.

<HEADLINE>  Pete Rose Back with Independent Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Pete Rose is banned from the major  
leagues and ineligible for the Hall of Fame. That means little to 
the Sacramento Steelheads, who look at the career hits leader as an 
inspiration and a publicity windfall. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose, who insists his stint as special instructor for the  
Western Baseball League team is not an effort to generate public 
support for his bid to overturn the ban, was back on a diamond 
Monday with a bat in his hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose, who will get paid about $50,000 to work with players  
averaging $1,250 a month, said he took the job because he loves to 
teach young players. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just to help Sacramento. This is not to help Pete  
Rose. This is fun,'' he said. ``I don't go to bed every night and 
pray I can go to the Hall of Fame. I can't live my life in the 
past. Life goes on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rose wore a black long-sleeved shirt, along with designer  
sunglasses and a Steelheads cap. In addition to working with the 
players and giving them a 75-minute inspirational speech Monday, 
Rose will be back May 28 to toss out the ceremonial first pitch at 
Sacramento's home opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose hit fungoes to Steelheads outfielders Monday, and then  
worked with the infielders on rundowns and other game situations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can still hit, I just can't run. I still have good  
hand-to-eye coordination,'' said Rose, who slammed liners and sharp 
grounders toward the aspiring major league outfielders. ``I'm 58 
years old -- I don't look it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rose, indeed, looks pretty good. He has gotten heavier and is  
slowed by aching knees. But he is tanned and fit, and retains the 
intense gaze and peripatetic style that were among his trademarks. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose, a 17-time All-Star and the NL MVP in 1973, agreed in  
August 1989 to accept a lifetime ban after commissioner A. Bartlett 
Giamatti concluded Rose bet on games involving the Cincinnati Reds 
while he was their manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose served five months at a federal prison after pleading  
guilty in April 1990 to two counts of filing false income tax 
returns by failing to report $354,968 in income from autograph 
appearances, memorabilia sales and gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	The career leader in hits with 4,256 and games with 3,562 is  
ineligible for the Hall of Fame as long as the ban is in effect. 
Rose applied for reinstatement in September 1997, but has not 
received a response from current commissioner Bud Selig. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the 14 people banned for life by baseball for gambling  
has been reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose is prohibited from going on the field or clubhouse of any  
major league team, or any minor league team in organized baseball. 
The Western Baseball League is independent and not covered by those 
rules. Monday's appearance was the first time Rose has actually 
worked with players since the ban. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose said he gave a speech to Reds minor leaguers last week in  
Rockford, Ill., and both Rose and his agent, Warren Greene, 
defended that appearance as allowable under the ban. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig's spokesman, Rich Levin, was unaware of the Rockford  
speech, but said if Rose spoke with Reds minor leaguers, it would 
appear to violate the ban. 
</P>
<P>
	Reds general manager Jim Bowden said one of the team's minor  
league officials was in Rockford when Rose visited and had been 
reminded of the terms of Rose's ban. Rockford general manager Bruce 
Keiter also was informed. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden was unaware of any speech Rose might have made to the  
minor leaguers. Keiter did not return a telephone message. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were no violations to our knowledge while he was  
there,'' Bowden said. 
</P>
<P>
	Steelheads players said they know about the ban, but appreciated  
hearing from Rose. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't idolize Pete Rose, but I respect his accomplishments.  
I loved watching him play,'' said pitcher Ryan Bowen, who played 
for the Houston Astros and Florida Marlins and is now trying to 
resurrect his career with the Steelheads. 
</P>
<P>
	Steelheads owner Bruce Portner said he went looking for a  
controversial figure to create a buzz around his expansion team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course it's for publicity. It helps keep Sacramento in the  
nation's eyes as a baseball town. Remember, there's been no 
professional baseball here for 25 years,'' Portner said. ``Let's 
face it, he's Pete Rose. He's banned but also a legend in 
baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rose was scheduled to give a 15-minute pep talk to the  
Steelheads, but ended up giving a 75-minute speech while standing 
near the pitcher's mound at Sacramento City College's Union 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's incredible to sit and listen to him,'' said catcher Tim  
McIntosh, a former major leaguer who went to spring training with 
the New York Yankees this year. ``He's an idol. He a god. You see a 
lot of guys coming through the clubhouse, but he's got 4,000 
hits.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Panel Rejects Steel Tariffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Domestic stainless steel producers will  
consider appealing a federal agency's decision rejecting punitive 
tariffs on some stainless steel imports. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry had sought tariffs to curb imports of stainless  
round wire from Japan and five other countries. But the U.S. 
International Trade Commission rejected tariffs Monday, ruling 6-0 
that foreign pricing practices do not hurt American producers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department determined earlier that Canada, India,  
Japan, South Korea, Spain and Taiwan illegally dumped stainless 
round wire in U.S. markets at prices below production costs. A 
commission finding of threat or actual injury was the last step 
needed before Commerce could impose tariffs of up to 36 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	George Kurisky, chairman of the Stainless Wire Action Committee,  
said the industry will review the commission's written opinion, 
expected in a few weeks, before deciding whether to appeal to the 
U.S. Court of International Trade in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	He said steel-makers were disappointed and ``continue to believe  
that the data prove injury to a competitive and efficient American 
industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stainless round wire is a low-quantity but high-value product --  
a $300 million-a-year domestic industry, with imports adding 
another $100 million. It is used to produce springs, wire rope and 
fasteners in construction and other applications. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Commerce found that Japan dumped a more common steel  
product, hot-rolled carbon steel. Japanese representatives 
denounced the ruling as politicized and looked to the autonomous 
trade commission for what they consider will be a more independent 
review. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's ruling means that the federal government will refund  
deposits and bonds collected on stainless round wire since November 
to cover any tariffs applied retroactively. 
</P>
<P>
	The cases were filed by ACS Industries Inc. of Woonsocket, R.I.;  
Al Tech Specialty Steel Corp. of Dunkirk, N.Y.; Branford Wire &AMP; 
Manufacturing Co. of Mountain Home, N.C.; Carpenter Technology 
Corp. of Reading, Pa.; Handy &AMP; Herman Specialty Wire Group of 
Cockeysville, Md.; Industrial Alloys Inc. of Pomona, Calif.; Loos &AMP; 
Co. Inc. of Pomfret, Conn.; Sandvik Steel Co. of Clarks Summit, 
Pa.; Sumiden Wire Products Corp. of Stockton, Calif.; and Techalloy 
Co. Inc. of Mahwah, N.J.

<HEADLINE>  Hawks, Mutombo Lead Pistons 2-0  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- He has heard and read the Mount  
Mutombo comments. They don't bother him. Dikembe Mutombo is a man 
on a mission. 
</P>
<P>
	Right now, the early work on that mission appears nearly  
complete. 
</P>
<P>
	Behind the inspired play of Mutombo, Atlanta's 7-foot-2 center,  
the Hawks take a 2-0 lead over Detroit into Game 3 of their 
best-of-5 first-round series Wednesday night at The Palace. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like to be mean on the floor,'' Mutombo said. ``I have no  
friends out there. After the game, I'll hug you and say `Hi' to 
you. When we're on the floor, we're on a mission.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If they can finish off the Pistons -- or when they do -- Mutombo  
and the Hawks will go on in search of a bigger prize. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, no one wearing a Detroit uniform has been able to  
control Mutombo at either end of the court. He burned the Pistons 
for 17 points, 19 rebounds and six blocks in the opener -- which 
Atlanta won 90-70. 
</P>
<P>
	``You just never get any easy baskets with him out there,''  
Pistons guard Joe Dumars said. ``During the course of a game you 
will normally get five or six easy baskets. You don't get those 
with him, and that magnifies everything else you do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Playing all but two minutes, he scored 28 points, grabbed a  
game-high 13 rebounds and virtually shut down any thought by the 
Pistons of driving the lane during an 89-69 rout in Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``The playoffs are where the great athletes come to play,''  
Mutombo said. ``They've been throwing a lot of bodies at me the 
last two games, trying to get me tired, trying to get me fatigued. 
But my body feels great. I feel great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pistons have complained that Mutombo positions himself  
illegally in the lane on just about every possession. Without help 
from game officials, however, they know there is only one way to 
move Mutombo out of there. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our big guys have to step out and make some shots,'' Detroit  
coach Alvin Gentry said. ``To challenge him in the paint is 
probably not the most intelligent thing to do, since he blocks a 
ton of shots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the Pistons haven't been able to make enough outside  
shots to lure Mutombo out of the lane. 
</P>
<P>
	After scoring 26 points in the opener, making him the only  
Detroit player in double figures, Grant Hill was held to 15 points 
in Game 2 and went nearly 17 minutes in the second and third 
quarters without scoring. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with that subpar effort, he still led the Pistons in  
scoring. 
</P>
<P>
	Bison Dele, the Pistons' center, has been completely overmatched  
against Mutombo. He had just seven points and 12 rebounds with four 
fouls while playing 32 minutes in the opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Things got even worse in Game 2. Dele had no points, one rebound  
and picked up five fouls in just 11 minutes of playing time. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew we could take advantage of them because they don't  
have a dominant center,'' Hawks swingman Steve Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta forward Chris Crawford, with an mild shoulder  
separation, did not travel to Detroit on Tuesday, but was to join 
the team Wednesday if his condition improved. He was listed as 
day-to-day. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chris has been playing terrific for us,'' Hawks coach Lenny  
Wilkens said. ``When he went down, Ty (Corbin) came in and stepped 
up real big and played well for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Henderson also was held out of practice and was still  
wearing a patch over his injured left eye. He still has double 
vision from an abrasion late in the regular season. Henderson 
played only four minutes in Game 1 and not at all in Game 2 and was 
listed as questionable for Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
	The injuries mean the Hawks have lost three forwards who were  
with them at the start of the season. LaPhonso Ellis has been out 
since the 20th game because of a sports hernia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guys have been stepping up all year,'' Wilkens said. ``We've  
got, all of a sudden, three starting forwards out. We just keep 
playing hard. We don't take anything for granted. We're just going 
to go out and play as hard as we can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit has lost the first two games of a playoff series 10  
times in franchise history. The Pistons have never recovered from 
such a deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever we're doing wrong, we'd better fix it fast,'' Detroit  
guard Lindsey Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks have never lost a series after going up 2-0, winning  
on six previous occasions with such a lead. Atlanta's last 2-0 lead 
was the first round of the 1988 playoffs against Milwaukee. The 
Hawks won that series 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know they're a quality ballclub that hasn't played up to  
its capabilities in the first two games,'' Atlanta's Tyrone Corbin 
said. ``We can't afford to think it's over.''

its capabilities in the first two games,'' Atlanta's Tyrone Corbin 
said. ``We can't afford to think it's over.''

<HEADLINE>  Pete Rose Back with Independent Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Pete Rose is banned from the major  
leagues and ineligible for the Hall of Fame. That means little to 
the Sacramento Steelheads, who look at the career hits leader as an 
inspiration and a publicity windfall. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose, who insists his stint as special instructor for the  
Western Baseball League team is not an effort to generate public 
support for his bid to overturn the ban, was back on a diamond 
Monday with a bat in his hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose, who will get paid about $50,000 to work with players  
averaging $1,250 a month, said he took the job because he loves to 
teach young players. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just to help Sacramento. This is not to help Pete  
Rose. This is fun,'' he said. ``I don't go to bed every night and 
pray I can go to the Hall of Fame. I can't live my life in the 
past. Life goes on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rose wore a black long-sleeved shirt, along with designer  
sunglasses and a Steelheads cap. In addition to working with the 
players and giving them a 75-minute inspirational speech Monday, 
Rose will be back May 28 to toss out the ceremonial first pitch at 
Sacramento's home opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose hit fungoes to Steelheads outfielders Monday, and then  
worked with the infielders on rundowns and other game situations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can still hit, I just can't run. I still have good  
hand-to-eye coordination,'' said Rose, who slammed liners and sharp 
grounders toward the aspiring major league outfielders. ``I'm 58 
years old -- I don't look it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rose, indeed, looks pretty good. He has gotten heavier and is  
slowed by aching knees. But he is tanned and fit, and retains the 
intense gaze and peripatetic style that were among his trademarks. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose, a 17-time All-Star and the NL MVP in 1973, agreed in  
August 1989 to accept a lifetime ban after commissioner A. Bartlett 
Giamatti concluded Rose bet on games involving the Cincinnati Reds 
while he was their manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose served five months at a federal prison after pleading  
guilty in April 1990 to two counts of filing false income tax 
returns by failing to report $354,968 in income from autograph 
appearances, memorabilia sales and gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	The career leader in hits with 4,256 and games with 3,562 is  
ineligible for the Hall of Fame as long as the ban is in effect. 
Rose applied for reinstatement in September 1997, but has not 
received a response from current commissioner Bud Selig. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the 14 people banned for life by baseball for gambling  
has been reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose is prohibited from going on the field or clubhouse of any  
major league team, or any minor league team in organized baseball. 
The Western Baseball League is independent and not covered by those 
rules. Monday's appearance was the first time Rose has actually 
worked with players since the ban. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose said he gave a speech to Reds minor leaguers last week in  
Rockford, Ill., and both Rose and his agent, Warren Greene, 
defended that appearance as allowable under the ban. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig's spokesman, Rich Levin, was unaware of the Rockford  
speech, but said if Rose spoke with Reds minor leaguers, it would 
appear to violate the ban. 
</P>
<P>
	Reds general manager Jim Bowden said one of the team's minor  
league officials was in Rockford when Rose visited and had been 
reminded of the terms of Rose's ban. Rockford general manager Bruce 
Keiter also was informed. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden was unaware of any speech Rose might have made to the  
minor leaguers. Keiter did not return a telephone message. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were no violations to our knowledge while he was  
there,'' Bowden said. 
</P>
<P>
	Steelheads players said they know about the ban, but appreciated  
hearing from Rose. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't idolize Pete Rose, but I respect his accomplishments.  
I loved watching him play,'' said pitcher Ryan Bowen, who played 
for the Houston Astros and Florida Marlins and is now trying to 
resurrect his career with the Steelheads. 
</P>
<P>
	Steelheads owner Bruce Portner said he went looking for a  
controversial figure to create a buzz around his expansion team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course it's for publicity. It helps keep Sacramento in the  
nation's eyes as a baseball town. Remember, there's been no 
professional baseball here for 25 years,'' Portner said. ``Let's 
face it, he's Pete Rose. He's banned but also a legend in 
baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rose was scheduled to give a 15-minute pep talk to the  
Steelheads, but ended up giving a 75-minute speech while standing 
near the pitcher's mound at Sacramento City College's Union 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's incredible to sit and listen to him,'' said catcher Tim  
McIntosh, a former major leaguer who went to spring training with 
the New York Yankees this year. ``He's an idol. He a god. You see a 
lot of guys coming through the clubhouse, but he's got 4,000 
hits.''

<HEADLINE> World Cup Still Expecting Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STANFORD, Calif. (AP) -- Even while canceling a military visit  
and suspending talks with the United States on arms control, 
international security and human rights, China has not threatened 
to pull out of the Women's World Cup this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	So despite the recent deep freeze in U.S.-China relations, World  
Cup president Marla Messing said Tuesday she is confident the 
Chinese -- among the tournament favorites -- will participate in the 
three-week event. 
</P>
<P>
	Messing said tourney organizers have not had any contact with  
Chinese soccer officials in the past few days, but that she has no 
reason to believe China will pull out of the event to protest the 
mistaken U.S. bombing of its embassy in Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are hoping things are going to settle down on the political  
side,'' she said. ``If they were to bow out, I think it would be 
disappointing from a competitive standpoint.'' 
</P>
<P>
	China has expressed outrage over the bombing, which killed three  
Chinese and seriously wounded six. It has led to days of street 
protests in Beijing that have made ambassador James Sasser a 
virtual prisoner at the U.S. Embassy in the Chinese capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Beijing canceled a planned visit next week by Gen. Charles  
Krulak, commandant of the Marine Corps, and Chinese President Jiang 
Zemin has refused to accept a telephone call of apology from 
President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have not heard anything from China,'' Messing said. ``It  
would be inappropriate for us to contact China. That kind of a 
decision is up to them. We welcome them to play in the 
tournament.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tournament begins June 19 and runs through July 10. The  
Chinese team, which has defeated the U.S. squad in two of their 
last three games, is expected to arrive in San Jose, Calif., around 
June 7 or 8. 
</P>
<P>
	China is scheduled to use San Jose State as its base and  
training center before its opening game there June 19 against 
Sweden. Its other first-round matches would be June 23 in Portland, 
Ore., and June 26 at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Chinese qualify for the quarterfinals, as expected, they  
would play June 30 in San Jose. They could not face the United 
States until the final on July 10 in Pasadena, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Tourney organizers rearranged the World Cup draw to ensure China  
would play its first game in the San Francisco Bay area, hoping to 
attract fans from the region's large Asian-American population. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese won the silver medal at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics,  
losing to the United States in the final. 
</P>
<P>
	With 37 days remaining before the start of the World Cup,  
Messing said more than 350,000 tickets have been sold for the 32 
games scheduled in seven cities around the country. Organizers hope 
to sell 475,000 tickets.

<HEADLINE> FDA Warns About Dialysis Blood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- The Food and Drug Administration has issued  
a nationwide safety alert over malfunctioning dialysis equipment 
that may have exposed patients to each other's blood. 
</P>
<P>
	The malfunctions have been reported at four treatment centers in  
Arizona, Florida, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, FDA officials said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The risk that patients were exposed to others' blood, and thus  
to blood-borne diseases, is ``extremely remote,'' said Steven 
Niedelman, an enforcement director for the FDA's Center for Medical 
Devices and Radiological Health in Rockville, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	The machines are used to cleanse the blood of deadly toxins when  
the kidneys fail. But Niedelman said there is concern because 
traces of blood were found in tubing inside the machines. Filters 
are supposed to prevent that from happening. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't really know the extent of the problem or what's  
causing the problem, so it's really a concern to us,'' Niedelman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	FDA spokeswoman Sharon Snider said the agency hasn't confirmed  
the tubing is the cause of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The alert advises facilities to inspect their machines, and if  
contamination is found, to disinfect them. 
</P>
<P>
	The manufacturer of blood tubing used in the dialysis procedure,  
Miami-based Nissho Nipro Corp., told the FDA on Friday it is 
recalling 154,000 tubing sets nationwide as a precaution. The 
company has distributed 2.1 million sets in the United States 
during the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Kelly, a spokesman for Nipro's distributor, Althin Medical,  
said: ``We don't know if there's a problem with the lines. There 
are several instances where there's been reported blood 
contamination in the pressurizing monitoring lines in the dialysis 
machine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at St. Mary's Hospital in Tucson said last month that  
121 kidney dialysis patients face months of blood tests to 
determine whether they were exposed to blood of other patients 
possibly infected with the AIDS virus, hepatitis or other 
infections. 
</P>
<P>
	Since December, there also have been incidents of blood  
contamination of dialysis equipment detected at Total Renal Care, a 
dialysis center in Miami Lakes, Fla; Lee Regional Hospital in 
Johnstown, Pa., and Bayonne Hospital in Bayonne, N.J., the FDA 
said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks New Markets in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Saying American businesses must invest in  
markets at home as they do abroad, President Clinton is appealing 
to the nation's chief executives to join the effort to breathe new 
life into cities and rural areas missing out on the current 
economic boom. 
</P>
<P>
	The president was convening a meeting today at the White House  
with 15 business leaders to discuss ways to bolster private 
investment in economically distressed communities. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Clinton was traveling to Atlanta for more discussions  
with CEOs and a tour of the Sweet Auburn Market, located near the 
Martin Luther King Jr. historic district, to see an example of the 
type of economic development he hopes to generate in other areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was to tout again his New Markets Initiative, a package  
of proposed tax incentives and loan guarantees designed to attract 
venture capital to areas in need of economic stimulus, such as 
Gary, Ind., the Los Angeles barrios and Appalachian hamlets. 
</P>
<P>
	He also was announcing plans to lead a delegation of CEOs and  
members of Congress on a tour of ``untapped markets'' the week of 
July 5. The White House said the trip was to be patterned after 
trade missions that Cabinet secretaries make overseas to identify 
markets where new jobs and development can be created. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president has been concerned, has spent a good bit of time  
over the last three years trying to come to grips with the 
problem,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Monday. ``Even 
though we have an economy that we haven't seen in a lifetime, if 
ever, in our country, there still are some areas of the country 
that haven't fully participated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president's New Markets plan was developed by an  
administration task force that consulted with investment advisers, 
members of Congress and pioneers in community development. Clinton 
first unveiled it in January at Jesse Jackson's Wall Street 
Project, a coalition of executives seeking to expand business 
opportunities for minorities and women, and included it as part of 
his fiscal 2000 budget proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Jackson's group played a prominent role in developing  
the proposal, Jackson himself was absent from today's events. 
</P>
<P>
	He was not listed among those meeting with Clinton at the White  
House, and was not invited to accompany the president to Atlanta. 
The head of the Wall Street Project, Sloan Financial Group CEO 
Maceo Sloan, was attending the White House meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's proposal includes:  
</P>
<P>
	--A $1 billion tax credit designed to spur $6 billion in new  
equity capital for investment in the targeted markets. The 
administration hopes the 25 percent credit will attract investors, 
who in turn could support small technology companies, inner-city 
shopping centers, manufacturers, retail stores and other 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	--Creation of new private investment partnerships to be known as  
America's Private Investment Companies patterned after the Overseas 
Private Investment Corp. APIC would make equity investments in 
larger businesses that expand or relocate to inner cities or rural 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
	--Targeting of the federal Small Business Investment Program to  
low- and moderate-income areas. This program provides equity and 
debt financing to small companies that are looking to grow. America 
Online and Staples are two examples of companies that have 
benefited from this program, but the White House says it has been 
of little benefit to inner cities and rural areas.

<HEADLINE> Speedway Deal Creates Racetrack Giant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- International Speedway Corp. is buying  
sports promoter Penske Motorsports Inc. for about $610 million in 
stock in a deal that will put 10 auto racing tracks in the United 
States under one owner. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, announced Monday, gives the International Speedway a  
tighter hold on some of auto racing's premier events, especially 
the NASCAR Winston Cup series. 
</P>
<P>
	Penske owns and operates Michigan Speedway in Brooklyn, Mich.;  
Nazareth Speedway in Pennsylvania; California Speedway in San 
Bernardino; and North Carolina Speedway near Rockingham. 
</P>
<P>
	ISC, which promotes about 80 events a year, owns or operates  
Daytona International Speedway, Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama, 
Phoenix International Raceway, Darlington Raceway in South 
Carolina, and Watkins Glen International in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``ISC will have a better, stronger hold on sponsors wanting to  
sponsor races or have a presence at race tracks,'' said Chris 
Hansen, motorsports analyst at NationsBanc Montgomery Securities in 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	ISC, of Daytona Beach, Fla., is paying $50 per share in stock  
and cash for 12.2 million shares of Detroit-based Penske. ISC 
already held 12 percent of Penske Motorsports. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1999, the two companies will promote more than 100 events.  
The companies generated more than $300 million in revenue last 
fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> NBC Win Tightens Ratings Race / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC now knows that biblical characters and Julia  
Roberts are great audience lures. Hippie killers are not. 
</P>
<P>
	The network won last week's prime-time ratings race with the  
month's biggest hit, ``Noah's Ark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The second part of the NBC mini-series, aired last Monday, was  
the week's second most-watched program behind ``ER.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Sunday's NBC mini-series, ``The Hunt for the Unicorn  
Killer,'' didn't do nearly as well. The story about convicted 
fugitive Ira Einhorn was soundly beaten in the ratings by CBS's 
movie, ``The Simple Life of Noah Dearborn,'' which starred Sidney 
Poitier. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the mixed results from its ``sweeps'' month events,  
NBC's boost from its biblical epic tightened the competition for 
the season crown with first-place CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	And the drama ``Law and Order'' reached its biggest audience  
since March 1997 with last Wednesday's episode, where movie star 
Roberts was the guest. 
</P>
<P>
	Five of the week's top eight shows were from NBC's Thursday  
night lineup. Yet even that was a mixed blessing: it was the 
lowest-rated Thursday evening of first-run shows for the network 
since 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week, NBC had a 9.9 rating and 17 share. CBS was second  
with a 9.0 rating and 15 share, ABC had a 7.5 rating and 13 share, 
and Fox had a 6.1 rating and 11 share. The WB was at 3.0 and 5, UPN 
had a 2.0 and 3, and Pax TV had a 0.7 and 1. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ``Nightly News'' won the evening news competition with a  
7.7 rating and 17 share. ABC's ``World News Tonight'' was second 
with a 7.1 rating and 16 share, while the ``CBS Evening News'' had 
a 6.3 and 14. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of May 3-9, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
ratings were: ``ER,'' NBC, 18.4; ``NBC Monday Night Movie: Noah's 
Ark, Part Two,'' NBC, 17.1; ``Friends,'' NBC, 14.3; ``CBS Sunday 
Movie: The Simple Life of Noah Dearborn,'' CBS, 13.8; ``Frasier,'' 
NBC, 13.8; ``Law and Order,'' NBC, 13.4; ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' NBC, 
12.0; ``Veronica's Closet,'' NBC, 11.9; ``Touched By an Angel,'' 
CBS, 11.7; ``Dateline NBC-Tuesday, 11.2.

<HEADLINE> Florida Woman Kills Stalker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEATHROW, Fla. (AP) -- A greenskeeper who stalked a woman for  
months was shot and killed by the woman after he entered her home 
with a handgun and rope. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Cook had repeatedly called Elizabeth MaGruder, spying on  
her with binoculars and skulking behind bushes as she golfed. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, he entered her home in an upscale gated community.  
Cook pulled a .25-caliber handgun from his waist and aimed it at 
Mrs. MaGruder's husband. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. MaGruder, 50, ran to a linen closet and got a gun. When  
Cook burst through the door, she fired her .38-caliber revolver 
once at close range and hit him in the chest, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cook fired back five times, hitting Mrs. MaGruder in the abdomen  
and wrist. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. MaGruder was listed in stable condition Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Seminole County Sheriff Don Eslinger said Tuesday that Mrs.  
MaGruder acted in self-defense and would not be charged. 
</P>
<P>
	Cook, 50, had been fired six months ago from Heathrow Country  
Club after Mrs. MaGruder complained about his constant phone calls. 
Mrs. MaGruder had hired Cook to work on her yard last year, but she 
stopped using him when she became uncomfortable with his attention, 
Eslinger said.

<HEADLINE> Republicans Restate Tax-Cut Pledge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans used Tuesday's symbolic ``Tax  
Freedom Day'' to renew their promise to pass tax relief in Congress 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have a tax cut,'' pledged House Majority Leader  
Dick Armey, R-Texas. ``Today's American family is overtaxed at all 
levels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Tax Foundation, a nonprofit research organization oriented  
toward business, calculates ``Tax Freedom Day'' as the time it 
takes Americans on average to finish paying all federal, state and 
local taxes each year and begin working for themselves. This year's 
date is 131 days into 1999, one day later than last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Although that formula is frequently criticized as overstating  
the burden on middle-class Americans, Republicans lined up to 
deliver floor speeches in the House to underscore the date. Senate 
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., even capped a news conference 
with a ``hallelujah'' and asked reporters if they knew what day it 
was. 
</P>
<P>
	``The money you get now is yours,'' Lott said.  
</P>
<P>
	Republicans are trying to put together a tax relief bill that  
probably would start out small in 2000 and 2001 and eventually grow 
to nearly $800 billion over the next decade. The effort is 
hamstrung because projected budget surpluses are almost all Social 
Security dollars in the first years -- an account the GOP promises 
not to touch. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tax cut in the first couple of years is going to be  
modest,'' said Rep. Jerry Weller, R-Ill. ``But then it's going to 
widen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the items under consideration are elimination of estate  
taxes, cuts in capital gains taxes, relief from the so-called 
marriage penalty paid by many two-income couples and business tax 
reduction. Tax-writing committees in the House and Senate expect to 
have legislation ready in July. 
</P>
<P>
	One decision has already been made: Expiring tax provisions  
affecting business that are likely to be renewed in this year's 
bill will have a retroactive effective date of July 1. Four of 
them, including the popular research and development tax credit, 
are set to expire June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill  
Archer, R-Texas, and Senate Finance Committee Chairman William 
Roth, R-Del., is important to companies attempting to put together 
financial plans for next year.

<HEADLINE> Braves' Jordan Thrown Out of Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Atlanta outfielder Brian Jordan, unhappy  
with a called third strike, let plate umpire Bruce Dreckman know 
how he felt and wound up getting thrown out of Tuesday night's game 
at San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second ejection of the night for the Braves. Manager  
Bobby Cox was tossed in the first inning for arguing a balk call 
against Odalis Perez. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco pitcher Shawn Estes had a 1-2 count against Jordan  
in the fifth inning when he delivered a pitch that Jordan thought 
was low and outside. Dreckman called him out, and Jordan walked 
slowly back to the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	After Estes fanned Andruw Jones to end the fifth, Jordan walked  
onto the field and confronted Dreckman. As the two argued, a couple 
of Jordan's teammates rushed to restrain him but not before 
Dreckman ejected him.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Bill Sparks Fights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Multibillion-dollar legislation to pay for  
U.S. military attacks on Yugoslavia and to help Central America 
recover from Hurricane Mitch has become a battleground on 
environmental issues ranging from mining regulations to Alabama 
sturgeon. 
</P>
<P>
	House-Senate leaders met Tuesday to begin composing a compromise  
package they hope to send to President Clinton by week's end. The 
main focus is a fight between the White House and Republicans over 
billions of dollars lawmakers want to add to the Pentagon's budget 
atop Clinton's request for $6 billion to cover U.S. costs in the 
NATO bombing campaign and refugee aid. 
</P>
<P>
	But numerous battles are being waged over environmental  
provisions included in an earlier, Senate-approved version of the 
legislation or that senators were trying to squeeze into the final 
package. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmental groups accused sponsors of the provisions of using  
the must-pass legislation to carry provisions that otherwise would 
have little chance of becoming law. 
</P>
<P>
	``The folks in the Senate pushing this stuff have reached a new  
low in cynically trying to take advantage of victims of natural 
disaster and war,'' said Marty Hayden, policy director for the 
Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican moderates in the House were also joining the fray.  
Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, R-N.Y., said more than 20 of his colleagues 
signed a letter objecting to senators' environmental provisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our party should be seen as expediting the release of this  
money, not delaying it with non-germane matters that do not belong 
in these spending bills in the first place,'' the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
	In one such fight, Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., is trying to  
block the Fish and Wildlife Service from listing the Alabama 
sturgeon as an endangered species, a battle that has raged since 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Alabama officials believe they are adequately protecting the  
fish with their own protection program. If the fish is listed as 
endangered, Shelby says, dredging in state waterways would be 
restricted, harming the timber and other industries that ship their 
products on barges. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are wrong and they know it,'' Shelby said of Fish and  
Wildlife officials. 
</P>
<P>
	After House members argued that Congress had never before  
blocked a species from being listed as endangered, Shelby said he 
would halt his effort if the Interior Department would promise to 
delay its effort until next year. That would let him wage his fight 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., is waging another effort to overturn  
a court ruling that mining companies can't use public lands to 
expand their milling operations. Environmentalists complain those 
operations pollute water. The ruling affects the Crown Jewel gold 
mine in Gorton's state and other Western hard-rock mines. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling, if upheld, would cause ``a tremendous degree of  
injustice,'' Gorton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other fights include:  
</P>
<P>
	--An effort by Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, to prevent the  
National Park Service from phasing out commercial fishing in the 
waters off Glacier Bay National Park until courts decide the issue. 
Environmentalists say that could take years. 
</P>
<P>
	--An attempt by Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., to delay the Interior  
Department in implementing stricter rules that would require mining 
companies using federal lands to do more thorough clean-ups. 
</P>
<P>
	--An amendment by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, to extend a  
moratorium on increasing the royalties oil companies using public 
lands must pay the government. Administration officials say this 
would cost the Treasury $5.3 million per month. 
</P>
<P>
	--Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., was considering trying to block the  
Interior Department from designating a protected habitat for the 
endangered silvery minnow. That designation would restrict New 
Mexicans' use of water from the Rio Grande River. 
</P>
<P>
	As always with spending bills, other issues are also cropping  
up. 
</P>
<P>
	The two chambers' negotiators tentatively agreed to add $900  
million to the measure to cover the costs of the recent Midwestern 
tornadoes and to buttress the Federal Emergency Management Agency's 
coffers for future disasters. That amount is more than $500 million 
more than Clinton sought. Aides said another $141 million or more 
might be added before the measure is finished. 
</P>
<P>
	They also tentatively agreed to provide $566 million -- $400  
million above Clinton's request -- for U.S. farmers staggered by 
plummeting prices for cotton, hogs, livestock and other 
commodities. Farm-state senators might try to boost the aid later. 
</P>
<P>
	An effort by Sens. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., and Arlen Specter,  
R-Pa., to add $265 million for anti-violence programs in schools 
went nowhere after House Republicans balked. Durbin initially 
sought nearly $1 billion.

<HEADLINE>  Pilot Sentenced in Italy Ski Tragedy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A Marine pilot convicted of  
obstruction of justice for helping destroy a videotape of his fatal 
flight over the Italian Alps will spend six months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury of seven officers deliberated about two hours Monday  
before announcing the sentence for Capt. Richard Ashby, 32, of 
Mission Viejo, Calif. Twenty people died when his jet cut an 
Italian ski gondola cable. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby, who faced a maximum sentence of 10 years, is the only  
person charged in the February 1998 accident to serve prison time. 
He also will be dismissed from the Marines. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby stood at attention as the sentence was read by Col. Gerald  
Yanello, commander of New River Air Station. He was then led away 
to the brig by two officers from his air wing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were all surprised,'' said defense attorney Frank Spinner.  
``No one thought that confinement was a final option. We were 
appalled the government even asked for two years of confinement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spinner said he would appeal the case once a review is conducted  
by Lt. Gen. Peter Pace, commander of Marine Forces Atlantic. The 
review could take six months. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby had no comment as he walked to a white Jeep driven by a  
military policeman. Before Ashby was taken away, he cried and 
hugged his mother, stepfather and girlfriend, Spinner said. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, a separate jury acquitted Ashby of 20 counts of  
involuntary manslaughter for the deaths of the passengers aboard 
the Mount Cermis gondola cable. The verdict enraged relatives of 
the victims, as well as Italian leaders 
</P>
<P>
	The EA-6B Prowler's navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, 31, of  
Westbury, N.Y., pleaded guilty to obstructing justice and was 
sentenced to dismissal from the service but no prison time. 
</P>
<P>
	Once Ashby landed the crippled jet at the NATO air base at  
Aviano, Italy, he took out the videotape, which was made earlier in 
the flight and was intended as a souvenir. 
</P>
<P>
	He testified that he later gave it to Schweitzer at the  
navigator's request. Schweitzer said he later threw it into a 
bonfire because he was afraid his face was on the tape and could be 
used by Italian media. 
</P>
<P>
	While acknowledging that he helped get rid of the tape, Ashby  
denied he had a criminal intent -- impeding the investigation into 
the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Two back-seat officers in the jet were charged with involuntary  
manslaughter soon after the accident but the charges were 
dismissed. One of those officers, Capt. Chandler Seagraves, told 
investigators about the tape after he was granted immunity from 
prosecution.

<HEADLINE> 7th Hiker Presumed Dead in Hawaii </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAUULA, Hawaii (AP) -- A California woman hiking with friends and  
relatives in a tropical gorge is still missing, and authorities 
consider her the seventh person killed by a weekend landslide. 
</P>
<P>
	Searchers were not trying to locate or retrieve the unidentified  
24-year-old's body from Sacred Falls State Park because of the high 
risk of another landslide. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not willing to risk our personnel for what may be a body  
retrieval,'' Honolulu Fire Chief Attilio Leonardi said. ``There is 
nothing more we can do without putting our people in harm's way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities learned of the woman's disappearance from her  
boyfriend, who is hospitalized with a broken leg. The two were 
side-by-side when the wave of rocks and trees washed over them. The 
woman hasn't been seen since. 
</P>
<P>
	The search effort first broke off Monday morning when military  
dogs and a chopper using heat-seeking cameras failed to detect any 
more bodies in the bottom of the narrow gorge, which is carpeted 
with debris from the cliffside. 
</P>
<P>
	Crews returned in the afternoon upon hearing the woman was still  
missing, but soon called off the operation. 
</P>
<P>
	The park itself has been indefinitely closed, as state  
geologists warned of the potential for more landslides like the one 
on Mother's Day that injured dozens more at one of Hawaii's most 
spectacular hiking spots. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we were up there this morning, several rocks came down  
and went into the pool and one came down between the other 
geologist and myself,'' state geologist Glenn Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The hikers were sunning themselves near a 90-foot waterfall  
Sunday afternoon when tons of boulders, some the size of small 
cars, ricocheted down into the narrow valley from 850 feet above. 
</P>
<P>
	``The site looked like something out of a war zone,'' Honolulu  
Fire Capt. Richard Soo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Six bodies have been recovered, four females and two males.  
</P>
<P>
	They were identified as Air Force Master Sgt. Scott Huling, 36,  
stationed at Hickam Air Force Base near Honolulu; Danielle 
Williams, 7, also of Hickam; Jennifer Johnson, 24, of Los Angeles; 
Aaron Bann, 31, of Placentia, Calif.; Donna Forsch, 38, of Elk 
Grove, Calif., and Teri Zerebeski, 42, of Sherwood Park, Alberta, 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen people remain hospitalized, including a 29-year-old man  
in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were bodies everywhere,'' said David Pahk, 37, a  
volunteer with the Sacred Falls Assistance Program that hands out 
bottled water and sunscreen to often-unprepared hikers. 
</P>
<P>
	He and a dozen others worked frantically to save the life of a  
young girl, carrying her out the trail on a stretcher and sharing 
CPR efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	``She just died in our hands,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Deborah Bianchi, a registered nurse, and her husband, Lt. Col.  
Michael Bianchi, an Army Ranger, had just started their hike when 
the landslide hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was such a beautiful day. That's what was so eerie about  
it. You'd go by rocks with blood on them, see discarded shoes 
covered with blood, but the birds were singing and it was so 
quiet,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The park in the lushly forested Koolau Range is about 30 miles  
north of Honolulu and across the road from the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	It long has been considered one of Hawaii's most popular natural  
attractions, with 56,000 annual visitors. It also is one of its 
most dangerous, with at least a dozen deaths since 1970.

<HEADLINE> CIA Explains What Went Wrong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The CIA had the right address when it proposed  
that NATO bomb a Yugoslav munitions bureau. But the agency couldn't 
correctly locate that address on a map of Belgrade, and the point 
it selected turned out to be the Chinese Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
	Two grim-faced U.S. intelligence officials delivered that  
extraordinary message to lawmakers in a closed-door session and 
then to reporters Monday as the diplomatic storm between Beijing 
and Washington swirled all around. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the right address applied to the wrong building,'' one  
of the officials said. The other said, ``None of the fail-safes 
worked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They met reporters on condition their names not be used.  
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen cited two key errors made by the  
CIA and missed by the Pentagon and NATO strike planners. 
</P>
<P>
	First, the spy agency failed to correctly pinpoint the target,  
the Yugoslav Federal Directorate for Supply and Procurement, on its 
maps. The directorate was a few hundred yards down the street from 
the site actually bombed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Second, the building that they did target turned out to be the  
Chinese Embassy, but their maps incorrectly located the embassy in 
a different part of Belgrade,'' Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	The CIA was working with a map dating to 1992 and made by the  
Defense Mapping Agency, a Pentagon organization now called the 
National Imagery and Mapping Agency. The map shows individual 
buildings in Belgrade but no specific street numbers. And despite 
two updates to the map done in 1997 and 1998, the map still showed 
the Chinese Embassy in its former location in the old section of 
Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese moved their embassy in 1996. The U.S. diplomatic  
mission in Belgrade was aware of the move, but a State Department 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the mission 
officials did not consider it their responsibility to notify U.S. 
and allied strike planners. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, the allied ``no strike'' list, a tally of churches,  
schools, hospitals and embassies that NATO strives to avoid as it 
pounds away at Yugoslavia, was outdated. 
</P>
<P>
	This paper error turned into disaster when the CIA, in  
recommending a strike on the procurement directorate, made a 
mistake when it tried to extrapolate the location of the arms 
directorate. The agency used known street addresses nearby, along 
with aerial imagery that showed a walled compound that fit 
intelligence information about the directorate's function as an 
arms supplier and exporter. 
</P>
<P>
	A missing ingredient was an agent on the ground in Belgrade  
actually looking at the prospective target because no agent was 
available. 
</P>
<P>
	A single B-2 bomber loaded with satellite-guided bombs attacked  
the compound Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior intelligence official described confusion, then shock  
and dismay at CIA headquarters and the Pentagon when they first 
learned that the Chinese Embassy had been bombed. The initial guess 
was that a bomb or missile had gone astray. 
</P>
<P>
	When the news that the embassy had been struck broke Friday  
night, ``We started looking, 'Where's (the Chinese Embassy) at?. Oh 
my gosh, it's the target,'' the intelligence official said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the strike, bewildered CIA officials still could find no  
document in their files giving the correct location of the Chinese 
Embassy, even though it was common knowledge in Belgrade and among 
the diplomatic community. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident has raised questions about the CIA's role in target  
planning. Knowledgeable U.S. officials speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the agency only occasionally picks targets. One of 
the few instances that gained attention occurred last summer when 
the CIA recommended an attack on a target in Sudan that turned out 
to be a pharmaceutical plant and that may or may not have been 
involved in chemical weapons production. 
</P>
<P>
	John Pike of the Federation of American Scientists said U.S.  
intelligence is lagging in developing the kind of 
building-by-building information strike planners need in today's 
combat environment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our style of war increasingly involves targeting individual  
buildings,'' said Pike, whose Washington-based group follows 
intelligence issues. ``I don't believe our intelligence community 
is currently focused on that requirement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But intelligence experts said the business of identifying and  
locating a specific building in enemy territory is far more complex 
than it sounds. In places like Baghdad and Belgrade, the CIA and 
Pentagon must constantly update lengthy databases showing potential 
targets and places to avoid. Cohen announced new steps to do a 
better job at this tedious but critical work. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on the reaction from Capitol Hill, the CIA may parlay one  
of its worst mistakes into a budget increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., chairman of the Senate Intelligence  
Committee, called the bombing ``a serious intelligence failure,'' 
but he said it is ``indicative of what happens when you ask too few 
people to do too much.'' Years of intelligence budget cuts, he 
said, ``have stretched our people to the breaking point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the difficulties involved, even military professionals  
were aghast at the error. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's incredible at this stage of the game that they don't have  
up-to-date maps,'' said Bernard Trainor, a retired general and 
co-author of a book on the Persian Gulf War.

<HEADLINE>  Kosovo Refugees To Move to Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TIRANA, Albania (AP) -- An operation to transfer Kosovo refugees  
from crowded camps in Macedonia to Albania is finally under way, 
relief officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Melitta Sunjic, spokeswoman for the U.N. High Commissioner for  
Refugees, said three buses carrying about 150 refugees arrived from 
Macedonia late Monday at a new camp near the southern Albanian town 
of Korca. Sunjic said all the refugees had relatives in Albania. 
</P>
<P>
	The Korca camp was built to accommodate 6,000 refugees, but thus  
far few refugees in Macedonia have expressed interest in the move, 
and the U.N. refugee agency says it won't transfer refugees against 
their will. 
</P>
<P>
	Macedonian authorities, worried about overcrowding at refugee  
camps and possible political instability, have been pressing the 
international community to help move abroad some of the more than 
238,000 Kosovo refugees in Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	Albania, which is already accommodating more than 426,000  
refugees, says it will take in as many as necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. officials estimate more than 750,000 ethnic Albanians have  
fled their homes in Kosovo, many of them forced by security forces 
to leave the southern province of Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant 
republic. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO launched a bombing campaign March 24 to force Yugoslavia to  
accept a peace deal for Kosovo, which includes an international 
force to ensure the safe return of refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	In Geneva, a spokeswoman today said the United Nations is  
running out of money for Kosovo refugees. UNHCR has received only 
$71 million of the $143 million it said it needed for its Kosovo 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has all been spent or fully committed,'' spokeswoman Judith  
Kumin said. ``If there are no new contributions, it means that 
we're not able to continue to procure relief supplies which the 
refugees need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Kukes, on the Albanian border with Kosovo, the UNHCR began  
tent-to-tent lobbying to try to persuade refugees to move further 
into the country and out of range of Serb artillery. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be very difficult. These people have been here a  
while, they're giving us very good, cogent reasons why they 
shouldn't leave,'' said spokesman Ray Wilkinson. ``It's going to be 
a hard sell.''

<HEADLINE> Energy Head Slows Declassification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Stung by an espionage scandal, Energy  
Secretary Bill Richardson ordered a broad array of security 
upgrades Tuesday and directed a slowdown of the administration's 
aggressive declassification of Cold War-era nuclear documents. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's critical that we guard our secrets more thoroughly,'' and  
there has been some concern that the declassification program was 
moving too fast, he said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson said he will consolidate the department's $800  
million widely dispersed security apparatus under a single 
``security czar,'' who will report directly to him with increased 
power over the weapons laboratories, which traditionally have 
cherished their independence. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``security czar'' will have ``juice and clout'' and report  
directly to him, said Richardson. He called the security 
consolidation a dramatic change from how the department long has 
operated and said he wants ``a three-star general with extensive 
security background'' for the top job. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, at a briefing with reporters, Richardson criticized the  
department's longtime security structure as ``nondirectional'' and 
``diffuse'' with a lack of accountability that over the years left 
nuclear secrets exposed to espionage and potential theft. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is clear that over the past several decades security and  
counterintelligence have not been given the necessary priority and 
attention,'' said Richardson, who took over the department last 
November. 
</P>
<P>
	Criticism has been widespread in Congress about security  
problems at the government's nuclear weapons research labs and 
reports of theft of nuclear secrets -- in the 1980s and possibly as 
late as 1995 -- at the Los Alamos lab in New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Seeking to blunt the attacks, Richardson also announced:  
</P>
<P>
	--Implementing new controls on top-secret as well as unsecured  
computer systems at weapons labs, including mechanical devices to 
prevent downloading and transfer of files to disks. 
</P>
<P>
	--Creating a team to evaluate espionage threats and DOE  
facilities' vulnerability to theft of secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	--Requiring banners on all computers warning users their machines  
are subject to search. 
</P>
<P>
	--Requiring that all foreign visits to weapons labs and other  
facilities be tracked and cleared by a central office at DOE 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	The department also will ask Congress for an extra $50 million  
over two years for computer security improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson also said the department's declassification of Cold  
War-era documents will be reviewed to ensure that material 
involving nuclear weapons design and other sensitive data is not 
inadvertently declassified. 
</P>
<P>
	An executive order that requires declassification by April 2000  
of all material at least 25 years old will be put on hold and 
extended for 18 months to allow a further review, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Department has been criticized in the past for its  
secretiveness. In 1993, then-Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary 
overruled reservations from some of the DOE's defense and security 
experts and began an aggressive move toward more openness. 
Declassification efforts were stepped up further after disclosure 
of improper radiation experiments on people in the early days of 
the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson said while some declassification will continue, the  
program will be reviewed to ensure that sensitive weapons-design 
documents are not released by mistake when mixed with other 
material. Officials said spot checks of files showed this to be a 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson said the overhaul of the department's security  
operation was designed to bring ``more responsibility, 
accountability and high-level attention'' to security within the 
department. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said he opposes suggestions making the rounds in  
Congress, such as turning over to the FBI all security and 
counterintelligence work, ending foreign visits to research labs or 
removing the labs from the Energy Department. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can demonstrate that the labs are accountable to us. We'll  
run the labs,'' said Richardson. Some critics complain that the 
prestigious weapons labs -- Los Alamos and Sandia in New Mexico, 
Lawrence Livermore in California -- often have considered themselves 
independent fiefdoms. 
</P>
<P>
	``I run the labs now. This has not always been the case,'' said  
Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore have been managed ever since  
their inception by the University of California, and some critics 
have suggested a campus atmosphere has added to security problems. 
While praising the labs for cooperating in imposing new security 
measures, Richardson said he has not ruled out putting the 
management contracts up for competitive bidding when they come up 
for renewal.

<HEADLINE>  Kosovo Refugees To Move to Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TIRANA, Albania (AP) -- An operation to transfer Kosovo refugees  
from crowded camps in Macedonia to Albania is finally under way, 
relief officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Melitta Sunjic, spokeswoman for the U.N. High Commissioner for  
Refugees, said three buses carrying about 150 refugees arrived from 
Macedonia late Monday at a new camp near the southern Albanian town 
of Korca. Sunjic said all the refugees had relatives in Albania. 
</P>
<P>
	The Korca camp was built to accommodate 6,000 refugees, but thus  
far few refugees in Macedonia have expressed interest in the move, 
and the U.N. refugee agency says it won't transfer refugees against 
their will. 
</P>
<P>
	Macedonian authorities, worried about overcrowding at refugee  
camps and possible political instability, have been pressing the 
international community to help move abroad some of the more than 
238,000 Kosovo refugees in Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	Albania, which is already accommodating more than 426,000  
refugees, says it will take in as many as necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. officials estimate more than 750,000 ethnic Albanians have  
fled their homes in Kosovo, many of them forced by security forces 
to leave the southern province of Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant 
republic. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO launched a bombing campaign March 24 to force Yugoslavia to  
accept a peace deal for Kosovo, which includes an international 
force to ensure the safe return of refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	In Geneva, a spokeswoman today said the United Nations is  
running out of money for Kosovo refugees. UNHCR has received only 
$71 million of the $143 million it said it needed for its Kosovo 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has all been spent or fully committed,'' spokeswoman Judith  
Kumin said. ``If there are no new contributions, it means that 
we're not able to continue to procure relief supplies which the 
refugees need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Kukes, on the Albanian border with Kosovo, the UNHCR began  
tent-to-tent lobbying to try to persuade refugees to move further 
into the country and out of range of Serb artillery. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be very difficult. These people have been here a  
while, they're giving us very good, cogent reasons why they 
shouldn't leave,'' said spokesman Ray Wilkinson. ``It's going to be 
a hard sell.''

<HEADLINE> High-Tech, Banking Propel Lobbying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Demonstrating that special interest lobbying  
follows the hot issues, a report shows that the biggest spenders in 
trying to influence federal officials are the health care, 
financial, insurance and high-tech industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Special interests averaged $117 million a month in lobbying  
expenses during the last half of 1998, according to the report 
Monday by Public Disclosure Inc., an Internet consulting firm. The 
figure compared with $100 million a month in lobbying expenditures 
in the first half of 1997, company co-founder Kent Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Old-line sectors such as agriculture, manufacturing, defense  
contractors and real estate were far behind in total lobbying 
expenditures, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The modern-day giants of Internet technology and  
telecommunications; the banking, insurance and securities firms 
that are becoming financial ``supermarkets''; and health-care 
companies with managed-care issues are among the interests now 
leading the lobbying pack. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lobbying expenditures reflect where the growth of the  
economy is right now,'' Cooper said. ``A lot of the rust-area 
manufacturing is not as big a factor as it used to be. This 
reflects that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report calculated the cost of special interest lobbying at  
$702.8 million for the last half of 1998. Communications and 
technology firms spent $94.3 million; followed by the 
finance-insurance sectors, with $91.8 million; and health-care 
firms, with $87.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The next highest spenders were energy and natural resources, the  
retail and services industries, transportation, agriculture, 
manufacturing, defense, real estate and construction and organized 
labor. 
</P>
<P>
	Among issues linked to lobbying expenses that Congress has or  
will consider are regulation of the Internet; mergers; services 
that banks, insurers and securities firms can provide; managed 
care; personal savings accounts; telecommunications; and world 
trade. 
</P>
<P>
	The lobbying ``exposes who the players are, who the big ones  
are,'' Cooper said. ``For the lobbying community it will be 
startling, because the report will show who else their client ... 
hired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Long-distance and local telephone companies led the spending in  
the communications field, followed by computer and electronics 
manufacturers, cable television firms and technology companies. In 
the financial and insurance fields, insurance companies, banks and 
financial firms and investment advisers were top spenders. 
</P>
<P>
	In the health-care sector, pharmaceutical companies, hospitals,  
health care systems, physicians, health maintenance organizations 
and medical plans were the top spenders, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the big-name companies and their trade associations that  
doled out large amounts of lobbying money: Sprint, AT&AMP;T, all the 
major regional phone companies, insurance groups such as American 
International, pharmaceutical firms including Pfizer. Trade groups 
with significant lobbying expenses included the Health Insurance 
Industry of America, the American Council of Life Insurance and the 
American Hospital Association.

<HEADLINE> Kmart Recalling 40,000 Gas Grills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- About 40,000 gas grills sold through Kmart  
stores are being recalled because of a fire hazard, the U.S. 
Consumer Product Safety Commission said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The burner manifold connection of the ``Tru-Burn'' LP portable  
grills may separate during use and spread flames outside the grill. 
The commission said at least one fire was caused by the faulty 
manifold connection but caused no injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Kmart sold the Tru-Burn grills from February 1996 through August  
1998 for about $22. Each grill has a black porcelain paint finish 
with two chrome-plated wire legs. When assembled, it stands 
12-inches high and 18-inches long and has rectangular handles 
attached to each end of the grill's body and a third attached to 
the lid. 
</P>
<P>
	People should stop using the grills immediately and return them  
to Kmart stores for a refund, the Consumer Product Safety 
Commission said. Additional information is available at (800) 
63-Kmart. 
</P>
<P>
	The recall does not effect the ``BBQ-PRO'' portable gas grills  
now being sold by Kmart.

<HEADLINE> China Demands Fuller U.S. Apology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Chinese media reported American and NATO  
apologies for the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia for 
the first time today, but government officials said the condolences 
were not enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian envoy for Yugoslavia, Viktor Chernomyrdin, met with  
Chinese President Jiang to discuss his efforts to negotiate an end 
to the conflict over Kosovo. Later Chernomyrdin told reporters that 
both sides agree the bombing of Yugoslavia must stop before peace 
talks can be held. 
</P>
<P>
	But he also said it was necessary to go ahead with a plan backed  
by Russia and the seven industrialized countries to withdraw 
Yugoslav forces from Kosovo and deploy an international security 
force. Russia hopes China will not block the plan in the United 
Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Several hundred people marched past the U.S. and British  
embassies in Beijing shouting slogans today -- a much smaller 
protest than those in the last three days. Some threw rocks, but 
police stopped others and tried to discourage it by moving loose 
paving stones away. 
</P>
<P>
	Police posted at the intersection where the government-approved  
protest route began selected who could protest and turned others 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of elevator company workers in blue overalls were  
ushered in. Others said they were told they were too young, needed 
to be in a group or to have written permission. Streets were 
blocked to keep back onlookers. 
</P>
<P>
	Newspapers carried reports of President Clinton's apology, and  
the midday TV news showed videotape of him saying he had offered 
condolences to Chinese President Jiang Zemin. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana also was shown apologizing,  
and the report included a list of NATO governments that have 
expressed regret. 
</P>
<P>
	Until today, China's state-run media did not report U.S. and  
NATO apologies and had dismissed claims that Friday's bombing of 
the embassy was an accident, inflaming protesters who believed the 
attack was intentional. 
</P>
<P>
	Having earlier encouraged the protests, the government began  
trying to dampen them, putting up posters at Beijing universities 
urging students to stay on campus. The posters said students could 
hold protest meetings, but should then return to studying, state 
television said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese officials said they want a fuller official apology from  
Washington and NATO. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were so indifferent. They simply said: `Well, we're  
sorry.' Then they shrugged their shoulders and walked away,'' Li 
Zhaoxing, China's ambassador to Washington, said on CNN. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said, ``To describe it in  
a dismissive way as a mistake cannot at all be convincing.'' He 
told reporters Chinese officials had noted the apology and were 
watching for further signs. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Beijing officially protested the bombing by  
suspending diplomatic ties with Washington on human rights, arms 
control, international security and high-level military contacts. 
Officials also demanded severe punishment for those responsible. 
</P>
<P>
	``So far I haven't seen any sign of the readiness of the  
U.S.-led NATO to bring the people responsible for the atrocity to 
justice,'' Li said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the chapel of a central Belgrade cemetery, the coffins of the  
three Chinese journalists killed in the attack were laid among 
flowers during a memorial service Monday. After cremation, the 
ashes were being flown home. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, when the remains are expected to arrive in  
Beijing, flags at U.S. diplomatic offices in China will be lowered 
to half-staff in a ``specific gesture of respect,'' said U.S. 
Embassy spokesman Bill Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
	Anti-American, anti-NATO protests have taken place in 20 Chinese  
cities and the U.S. consulate in the western city of Chengdu was 
damaged over the weekend by fire. However, U.S. consulates in other 
Chinese cities were quiet today, embassy spokesman Tom Cooney said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Beijing, most of today's protests were directed at the U.S.  
Embassy. Only a few demonstrators shouted slogans as they passed 
the British Embassy, which lies along a seven-block, officially 
sanctioned protest route. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Ambassador James Sasser stayed in his embassy while  
security officials decided whether he could leave safely. Other 
U.S. diplomats were blocked from returning to the main embassy 
building, Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
	British Ambassador Anthony Charles Galsworthy, who also remained  
in his embassy during the protests, was free to come and go today. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Beijing university district today, cafes offering  
Internet access demanded that students from NATO countries sign a 
statement condemning the attack before being allowed to check their 
e-mail.

<HEADLINE> Storm Victims Re-Establish Identity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOORE, Okla. (AP) -- People who lost all their identification in  
the Oklahoma tornadoes now have to prove that they are who they say 
they are. 
</P>
<P>
	Maps are being pulled out for people to point out where they  
once lived, and many are being asked for a thumbprint. 
</P>
<P>
	For many victims, the twisters that killed 41 people in Oklahoma  
carried away nearly all of their vital papers: birth certificates, 
driver's licenses, titles to homes and other documents. 
</P>
<P>
	In Midwest City, residents who ask for duplicate documents but  
have no ID are given a pop quiz to prove they were homeowners. 
Police records specialist Hazel Hamer takes out a map and asks them 
to point to where their houses were before the tornadoes blew them 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	``We realize some people have lost everything,'' she said. ``We  
just go by the map and we check the utility records to make sure 
the name and address on the bills match the addresses people are 
giving us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Williamson of the state Department of Safety has processed  
applications for more than 100 driver's licenses over several days 
in a room at the First Baptist Church in Moore, which has been used 
as a service center for storm victims. 
</P>
<P>
	People have been offering everything from fishing licenses to  
American Association of Retired Persons membership cards to prove 
their identity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I took a guy awhile ago who had his entire criminal booking  
record with his name and address on it,'' Williamson said. ``He got 
his license.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To guard against fraud, Williamson calls up driving histories  
and quizzes applicants about speeding tickets, maiden names or how 
long they have been driving. 
</P>
<P>
	Everyone is asked to give a thumbprint, which scares away the  
criminals and gives state investigators some key evidence if the 
license is used to commit fraud, Williamson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have had some people come into the exam stations who change  
their stories or don't know all the answers,'' he said. ``They 
leave pretty quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kent and Kellie Taylor, married a decade ago, were among the  
lucky ones. Taylor had his driver's license in his pocket when he 
took cover in a closet with his children, ages 18 months and 9 
years, as the tornado ripped away the roof of their three-bedroom 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	He should be able to quickly replace his marriage license and  
his children's birth certificates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I'm still married to him and I'm not going to let him  
forget that,'' Mrs. Taylor joked Tuesday, as the couple drove 
through the rubble that once was their neighborhood.

<HEADLINE> Sele Won't Start Because of Flu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Texas Rangers pitcher Aaron Sele was scratched  
from his scheduled start against the Chicago White Sox on Tuesday 
night because of the flu. 
</P>
<P>
	Esteban Loaiza, who has made 10 relief appearances this year,  
made his first start of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Sele, 3-3 with a 4.54 ERA, is the last Texas player to come down  
with the flu. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had that,'' manager Johnny Oates said. ``There were about  
four days I didn't want to sit on the bench, let alone pitch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Loaiza, has a 6.75 ERA in 21 1-3 innings of relief. He's allowed  
a run in nine of his 10 relief appearances, and given up seven in 
his last four games. 
</P>
<P>
	Loaiza was a starter when the Rangers acquired him from  
Pittsburgh last summer. He went 3-6 with a 5.40 ERA in 14 starts 
for Texas. He also started four games in spring training this year, 
going 0-1 with an 8.10 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Clark is scheduled to pitch Wednesday and Mike Morgan on  
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> FBI Criticized Over Flight 800 Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Almost from the moment TWA Flight 800 plunged  
into the ocean off Long Island in July 1996, conspiracy theorists 
argued that the FBI did not do enough to prove that a bomb or 
missile downed the Boeing 747. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the bureau came under fire for what some said was a  
single-minded pursuit of that terrorist theory, even as evidence 
mounted that mechanical failure was to blame. 
</P>
<P>
	``FBI leadership, in the case of TWA Flight 800, was a  
disaster,'' Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said at the opening of 
his Senate subcommittee hearing on the crash investigation. ``In 
fact, it's fair to say that the FBI hindered the investigation and 
... in my view, the FBI risked public safety.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hearing relied heavily on a 24-page report from the Bureau  
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms that concluded just six months 
after Flight 800 went down that mechanical failure was to blame. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI was accused Monday of trying to suppress that report in  
what critics said was a heavy-handed and sometimes bumbling rush to 
prove that a bomb or a missile downed the plane. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators eventually determined a mechanical malfunction  
caused the plane's center fuel tanks to explode, killing all 230 
people on board. 
</P>
<P>
	A former scientific investigator with the FBI who worked on the  
Flight 800 case described how James Kallstrom, then-director of the 
FBI's New York bureau, became enraged when the investigator 
disputed the bomb theory. 
</P>
<P>
	``He got about six inches from my face and proceeded to advise  
me in very graphic terms that it was a bomb,'' said William Tobin, 
who was later taken off the TWA 800 case by Kallstrom. ``I ended up 
wearing several particles of his saliva from that presentation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kallstrom, who did not testify Monday and has since left the  
FBI, denied he had suppressed the report but said he did not want 
it released prematurely. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't even have all the pieces off the ocean floor yet, we  
hadn't even built the reconstruction (of the plane),'' Kallstrom 
said. ``It is not that we were holding out for a bomb or missile. 
We were holding out for a thorough comprehensive investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials from the National Transportation Safety Board and the  
ATF maintained that the FBI took over the investigation and was 
sloppy in collecting evidence. Only FBI agents were allowed to 
develop pictures of the plane and evidence was allowed to disappear 
from the hangar where the plane was being reconstructed, the 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some seat covers from the plane were found in a trash bin and  
one NTSB official said he walked in to find an FBI agent pounding 
one piece of evidence with a hammer. 
</P>
<P>
	They said the NTSB was, by statute, the lead agency on the crash  
but the probe became an adversarial turf war, something Grassley 
hopes to change by clarifying language to make the roles of the 
agencies clearer. 
</P>
<P>
	ATF officials also said once they had concluded that mechanical  
failure downed the plane, they pushed to circulate their report out 
of fear that other planes might meet a similar fate. But the FBI 
stonewalled, they said. ATF officials were brought in as experts in 
explosives. 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley presented various hand-scribbled notes from ATF and  
NTSB officials that he said showed frustration with the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kallstrom upset with report. Locks him into eliminating  
missile. Refuses to see report,'' read one March 12, 1997, note 
from Anthony Vita, the ATF's assistant director of field 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis Schiliro, the FBI's assistant director in the New York  
office, testified Monday that claims the FBI had sat on the ATF 
report were wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the crash came at a politically volatile time -- Ramzi  
Yousef was on trial in New York City for conspiring to blow up 12 
U.S. airliners. That, combined with eyewitness descriptions 
seemingly consistent with a missile firing, made a terrorist attack 
more than a possibility, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can you imagine, Mr. Chairman, if we had not pushed to look at  
every possibility, no matter how remote?'' Schiliro asked Grassley. 
``I and all of the law enforcement people who worked on this would 
not have been doing our jobs and would have been rightly subject to 
harsh criticism.''

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets closed generally lower  
Tuesday, with prices slumping both in Tokyo and Hong Kong on 
profit-taking. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost  
233.83 points, or 1.38 percent, closing at 16,743.18. On Monday, 
the average gained 30.49 points, or 0.18 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors took profits on the belief that the Japanese  
government may not come up with fresh economic stimulus measures 
any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said Tuesday that he is not  
thinking about compiling a supplementary budget now, although he 
added that September would be a good time to review the economy and 
see if more stimulus measures are needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the Nikkei index rallied to its highest level since  
October 1997, rising to 17,300.61 at Thursday's close after a 
senior ruling Liberal Democratic Party official suggested the 
government should consider an extra budget. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. dollar was quoted at 120.88 yen in late afternoon  
trading Tuesday, up 0.02 yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also 
above its late New York level of 120.50 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks in Hong Kong fell amid concerns over strained U.S.-China  
relations in the aftermath of NATO's bombing of the Chinese embassy 
in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of  
blue chips, fell 288.83 points, or 2.2 percent, closing at 
12,874.37. On Monday, the index had gained 165.77 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said deteriorating Sino-U.S. relations following  
Friday's bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade gave investors 
a reason to take profits. The bombing led to protests in China. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a long-overdue correction as the market has been  
looking for a reason to consolidate,'' said Eugune Law, chief 
operating officer at Celestial Asia Securities Holdings Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korean shares also tumbled after five straight sessions of  
gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said investors were concerned over recent rises in local  
interest rates as well as on declines in some major Asian markets. 
The Korea Composite Stock Price Index fell 32.83 points, or 4 
percent, to 781.41. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Share prices closed higher as an inflow of  
institutional funds, mainly from Europe, drove the market up. The 
Straits Times Index rose 26.50 points, or 1.4 percent, to 1,888.88. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian share prices closed sharply higher on  
expectations that national electricity power provider, Tenaga 
Nasional Bhd., would announce a sharp recovery in its half-year 
financial results. The benchmark Composite Index surged 2.5 
percent, or 17.56 points, to close at 723.39. 
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Share prices closed slightly lower on profit-taking  
following recent gains. The market's key Weighted Stock Price Index 
fell 9.92 points, or 0.13 percent, to 7,474.45. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed lower as a  
successful debut listing by diversified energy company Contact 
Energy Ltd. failed to spark the local market, brokers said. The 
NZSE-40 Capital Index fell 31.70 points, or 1.4 percent, to 
2,194.95. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares closed lower. The 30-company  
Philippine Stock Exchange Index, or PSE Index, fell 27.25 points or 
1.1 percent, to 2,537.58. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: The Australian share market closed broadly weaker as  
investors dropped cyclical and mining stocks, concerned that their 
impressive run over recent sessions is at an end. The All 
Ordinaries Index fell 11.8 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,984.9. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Fall After Weak Auction / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices fell after a weak showing of demand  
for 5-year notes at an auction Tuesday, pushing the yield on the 
long Treasury bond to the highest level in nearly a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 19/32  
point, or $5.94 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in 
the opposite direction, rose to 5.83 from 5.79 percent late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury sold $15 billion of five-year notes at 5.367  
percent, an 11-month high, in the first leg of a two-day auction. 
</P>
<P>
	The news sent the price of the long bond, which was already down  
for the day, even lower. The resulting yield of 5.83 hasn't been 
seen since last May 27, when it reached 5.84. 
</P>
<P>
	With bond yields more competitive with stocks, equities prices  
also fell. The Dow Jones industrial average ended 18.90 higher at 
11,026.15, well off its highs of the day when it crossed the 11,100 
level. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
fell between 1/16 point and 1/8 point. Intermediate maturities fell 
3/16 to 11/32 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial 
information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.60 percent as the  
discount was unchanged from Monday's auction price at 4.48 percent. 
Six-month yields were 4.69 percent, as the discount rose 0.01 
percentage point from Monday's auction price to 4.52 percent. 
One-year yields were 4.76 percent as the discount rose by 0.02 
percentage point from late Monday to 4.54 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, remained unchanged at 4.69 percent from late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell to 122 7/16 from 122 11/16 Monday. The 
average yield to maturity rose to 5.35 percent from 5.33 late 
Monday.

<HEADLINE> World Cup Still Expecting Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STANFORD, Calif. (AP) -- Despite the recent deep freeze in  
U.S.-China relations, Women's World Cup president Marla Messing 
said Tuesday she is confident the Chinese -- among the tournament 
favorites -- will participate in this summer's event. 
</P>
<P>
	Messing said tourney organizers have not had any contact with  
Chinese soccer officials in the past few days, but that she has no 
reason to believe China will pull out of the event to protest the 
mistaken U.S. bombing of its embassy in Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are hoping things are going to settle down on the political  
side,'' she said. ``If they were to bow out, I think it would be 
disappointing from a competitive standpoint.'' 
</P>
<P>
	China has expressed outrage over the bombing, which killed three  
Chinese and seriously wounded six. It has led to days of street 
protests in Beijing that have made ambassador James Sasser a 
virtual prisoner at the U.S. Embassy in the Chinese capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Beijing canceled a planned visit next week by Gen. Charles  
Krulak, commandant of the Marine Corps, and Chinese President Jiang 
Zemin has refused to accept a telephone call of apology from 
President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have not heard anything from China,'' Messing said. ``It  
would be inappropriate for us to contact China. That kind of a 
decision is up to them, we welcome them to play in the 
tournament.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tournament begins June 19 and runs through July 10. The  
Chinese team, which has defeated the U.S. squad in two of their 
last three games, is expected to arrive in San Jose, Calif., around 
June 7 or 8. 
</P>
<P>
	China is scheduled to use San Jose State as its base and  
training center before its opening game there June 19 against 
Sweden. Its other first-round matches would be June 23 in Portland, 
Ore., and June 26 at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Chinese qualify for the quarterfinals, as expected, they  
would play June 30 in San Jose. They could not face the United 
States until the final on July 10 in Pasadena, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Tourney organizers rearranged the World Cup draw to ensure China  
would play its first game in the San Francisco Bay area, hoping to 
attract fans from the region's large Asian-American population. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese won the silver medal at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics,  
losing to the United States in the final. 
</P>
<P>
	With 38 days remaining before the start of the World Cup,  
Messing said more than 350,000 tickets have been sold for the 32 
games scheduled in seven cities around the country. Organizers hope 
to sell 475,000 tickets.

<HEADLINE> No Water Alarm on Sunken Tour Boat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOT SPRINGS, Ark. (AP) -- The operator of a tourist boat that  
sank in a minute, taking 13 people down with it, said at a hearing 
Tuesday that there was virtually no sign of trouble before the 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Helmbrecht told the Coast Guard Marine Safety Board of  
Investigation that nothing appeared wrong until shortly before the 
Miss Majestic sank May 1. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she went down with the Miss Majestic and was near the  
bottom of Lake Hamilton before she managed to escape. 
</P>
<P>
	``You couldn't see anything, then water started coming in my  
nose and then I saw some light finally,'' said Helmbrecht, one of 
eight survivors. ``Then I saw only a few people kicking their feet 
and when I got up, there was only a few of them there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She began sobbing and was helped from the stand.  
</P>
<P>
	The accident happened two days after Helmbrecht had taken her  
boat to mechanics and complained that its bilge pump was switching 
on and off erratically. She said she was assured the repairs had 
been made and was confident that the boat was seaworthy. 
</P>
<P>
	Helmbrecht said the Miss Majestic tilted slightly left about  
five minutes after entering the water during the tour. She asked a 
passenger to move, thinking he could help balance the boat. But 
then, she said, water poured in from the rear and the bottom of the 
boat. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she yelled at passengers to get out and had no time to  
grab a life jacket. She said she tried to save a young boy as the 
boat went down, grabbing his hand and leading him toward an opening 
under the boat's canopy. He was jerked away from her, apparently by 
the force of the water, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Helmbrecht said she had instructed passengers on how to use the  
boat's life preservers before it set out, as required by the boat's 
owner, Land and Lake Tours Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	But Robert Powers of Little Rock, one of the accident's  
survivors, said in an interview with The Associated Press last week 
that Helmbrecht gave no safety instructions. 
</P>
<P>
	In her testimony, Helmbrecht said she did not hear an alarm  
alerting occupants that water was coming into the boat, which was 
mandated by the Coast Guard after a Feb. 23 inspection. The 
company's lawyer said Monday it appeared the alarm had not been 
installed despite a March 11 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Other survivors are expected to testify at the weeklong Coast  
Guard hearing into the cause of the accident.

<HEADLINE> Unintended Victims at a Glance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Since the bombing of Yugoslavia began on March 24, more than 100  
people have been reported killed by NATO's mistaken attacks on a 
refugee convoy, a passenger train, a market and hospital complex, 
residential neighborhoods and the Chinese Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
	Mistakes in warfare or times of high military tension are not  
new. Some examples from recent history: 
</P>
<P>
	April 1994: Two U.S. Air Force F-15s shoot down two U.S. Army  
helicopters on a diplomatic mission over Iraq, mistaking them for 
hostile aircraft in the ``no-fly zone,'' killing 26 people. No one 
was found criminally responsible. 
</P>
<P>
	February 1991: The United States bombs a shelter in Baghdad  
during the Persian Gulf War, killing more than 300 people. U.S. 
officials said it was an Iraqi military center and they did not 
know civilians were inside. U.S. public support for the war 
remained high despite the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	January 1991: Seven U.S. Marines are killed when a missile fired  
by a U.S. Air Force A-10 attack aircraft hits their armored vehicle 
during a battle with the Iraqis. In all, more than 30 U.S. and nine 
British service members were killed by ``friendly fire'' during the 
war. 
</P>
<P>
	July 1988: U.S. warship Vincennes shoots down an Iranian  
passenger plane over the Persian Gulf, mistaking it for a 
threatening warplane, during the war between Iraq and Iran. All 290 
people aboard are killed. United States paid over $130 million in a 
1996 settlement that included compensation for families of the 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
	April 1986: U.S. bombing in Libya damages French Embassy but no  
one is hurt.

<HEADLINE>  Cezanne Sells for $60.5 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A Cezanne still life sold Monday for $60.5  
million, the fourth-highest price ever for a work of art sold at 
auction. 
</P>
<P>
	The painting, ``Still Life With Curtain, Pitcher and Bowl of  
Fruit,'' is ``as close to perfection as I have ever witnessed a 
work of art,'' Charles S. Moffett, a specialist in Impressionist 
and modern art for Sotheby's auction house, said after the sale. 
</P>
<P>
	In the painting, executed in 1893-1894, fruit spills across a  
simple table, balanced by a gray earthenware jug. 
</P>
<P>
	The price far exceeded Sotheby's estimate of $35 million. The  
previous record for a Cezanne sold at auction was $28.6 million at 
Sotheby's in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cezanne led a strong sale of artworks from the collection of  
socialite Betsey Cushing Whitney and her husband, John Hay ``Jock'' 
Whitney, a financier, collector and ambassador to Great Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	All buyers were anonymous.  
</P>
<P>
	The highest price ever paid for a painting at auction was $82.5  
million for van Gogh's ``Portrait of Dr. Gachet,'' sold by 
Christie's during the height of the art boom in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	The second-highest was $78.1 million for Renoir's ``At the  
Moulin de la Galette,'' also in 1990, followed by $71.5 million for 
a van Gogh self-portrait that sold last fall.

<HEADLINE> `The Mummy' Takes In $44 Million / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``The Mummy,'' a remake of the 1932 Boris  
Karloff classic, survived mixed reviews to set a record for the 
biggest movie opening ever outside summer, grossing $43.4 million 
over Mother's Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The opening ranked 9th among the top 10 all-time weekends,  
according to final figures released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Universal Studios President Ron Meyer said he had expected a  
debut closer to $30 million for the horror and special-effects film 
starring Brendan Fraser. The remake was Universal's third-largest 
opening, exceeded only by ``The Lost World: Jurassic Park'' ($90.2 
million) and ``Jurassic Park'' ($47 million). 
</P>
<P>
	Other top films in North America over the Mother's Day weekend  
included ``Entrapment,'' the Sean Connery cat-burglar adventure, 
dropping to No. 2 with a take of $12.3 million in its second 
weekend of release. The Keanu Reeves sci-fi movie ``The Matrix'' 
was third with $5.9 million in its sixth weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``Election,'' starring Reese Witherspoon and Matthew Broderick,  
was fourth with $3.2 million, followed by ``Never Been Kissed'' at 
$3 million and ``Analyze This'' $1.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Matrix'' leads 1999 films with $138.5 million, and  
``Analyze This'' with Robert DeNiro and Billy Crystal passed the 
$100 million mark after 10 weeks in theaters.

<HEADLINE> Reporter Fired for Cancer Tales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OWENSBORO, Ky. (AP) -- In frank and wrenching words, Kim Stacy  
told her rural Kentucky readers that her death was fast 
approaching. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to die! I'm going to die!'' she wrote recently in a  
series of columns in the Owensboro Messenger-Inquirer. ``I have 
terminal brain cancer. I was told I had about 10 months to a year 
to live.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Ms. Stacy now admits she lied. The 33-year-old reporter  
isn't a victim of cancer, though she said she's been battling 
another illness for four years -- AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm terribly sorry. I didn't think about what I was doing,''  
she said Monday after being fired from the newspaper. ``I betrayed 
a lot of people and misled a lot of people including my own friends 
and family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Stacy said she lied because of the stigma attached to AIDS.  
</P>
<P>
	``I grew up in a small-town atmosphere where you are crucified  
for having AIDS or being gay,'' said Ms. Stacy, who is a lesbian. 
``Nobody knew until this weekend that I have AIDS.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper's publisher, Ed Riney, said he feels compassion  
for Ms. Stacy's situation but also an obligation toward his 
readers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are victims and party to a hoax,'' he said. ``The news  
business is about checking the facts. We let our hearts overrun our 
reasoning in Kim's case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Five of Ms. Stacy's columns were published in the  
Messenger-Inquirer, one of which was distributed in Kentucky by The 
Associated Press. A sixth was scheduled to run Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Stacy said she decided to tell her editors that the columns  
were fabrications after being confronted by suspicious employees 
from the Appalachian News-Express in Pikeville, where she worked 
until March 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	News-Express publisher Marty Backus said Ms. Stacy told the  
newspaper staff four years ago she had terminal stomach cancer, but 
a later examination revealed the cancer had disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody was tickled,'' Backus said. ``We had her on prayer  
lists. We thought our prayers had been an answered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the News-Express published a special section about cancer  
survivors, Ms. Stacy's photo was put on the cover, Backus said. 
</P>
<P>
	A few months after joining the Messenger-Inquirer, Ms. Stacy  
told her co-workers her cancer had returned, the newspaper reported 
today. Later, she said it had been cured. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, she again told co-workers the cancer had  
returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, two columnists resigned from The Boston Globe after  
allegations they falsified facts and invented people in their 
columns, and The New Republic fired a reporter for fabricating all 
or part of 27 magazine articles.

<HEADLINE> Gun Shop Pulls Cheap Handguns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- A gun store reportedly cited as leading the  
nation in sales of weapons later linked to crimes pulled cheap, 
so-called ``Saturday night special'' handguns from its shelves, at 
least temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
	``If people felt that was a problem, we decided to take them off  
the shelf,'' said Curtis Beatovic, one of the three owners of 
Badger Guns &AMP; Ammo in West Milwaukee. Guns that had been on sale at 
the store last week for $99.99 were gone Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the handguns would be shipped back to manufacturers and  
declined to comment further. When asked about criticism over the 
sales of cheap handguns, he replied: ``A gun is a gun is a gun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal tracing information complied by the U.S. Bureau of  
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms showed Badger sold 1,060 guns between 
1996 and 1998 that later were recovered by authorities as linked 
with crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	The ATF has not announced full statistics on the survey but the  
Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported Sunday that the Badger store 
ranked first nationwide among 80,000 federally licensed firearms 
dealers last year in crime-gun tracings. 
</P>
<P>
	James Fendry, leader of the Wisconsin Pro-Gun Movement, said  
Badger's move was temporary. 
</P>
<P>
	The gun store owners ``were concerned there might be some people  
who would come down and protest,'' Fendry said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were also concerned because they got a hailstorm of calls  
from people who wanted to come down and buy the cheaper handguns.''

<HEADLINE> Blazers Seek Sweep in 1st Round </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- If the Portland Trail Blazers are going to move  
on and up in the playoffs, they're going to have to win on the 
road. A victory Wednesday night over Phoenix, and the resulting 
first-round sweep of the Suns, would be a great place to start. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blazers would not have the homecourt advantage against  
either Utah or San Antonio in a future playoff series. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to play well on the road to be successful,'' Damon  
Stoudamire said. ``One way or another, we're going to have to start 
winning games on the road if we're ultimately going to get to the 
goal that we've wanted from the beginning of the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two victories in Portland left the Blazers on the brink of their  
first opening-round series triumph since Clyde Drexler and Terry 
Porter led them to the NBA Finals in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	The natural tendency is to ease up for Game 3. After all, the  
Blazers need just one victory in the next three games to win the 
best-of-5 series. But Portland coach Mike Dunleavy said title 
contenders shouldn't think that way. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to come in here with that urgency,'' Dunleavy said  
before the Blazers worked out at America West Arena on Tuesday. 
``It can't be the idea that we'll win one out of three. That is not 
the mindset of a team that's going very far. Our mindset has got to 
be that we've got to get it done in three, and anything less than 
three is not successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an effort to resolve the matchup nightmare his team faces  
against Portland, Suns coach Danny Ainge kept Rex Chapman and Luc 
Longley on the bench most of Game 2 Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	After shooting just 3-for-12 and getting dominated by the  
Blazers' Isaiah Rider in Game 1, Chapman played just seven minutes 
in Game 2. Ainge played Randy Livingston, signed just before the 
last regular-season game, instead of Chapman in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have not lost confidence in Rex,'' Ainge said. ``I needed to  
make a change and it was a defensive change. I knew Rex would not 
be happy with it. That's what I love about Rex Chapman. That sucker 
loves to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chapman shrugged off the situation, the latest setback in what  
has been a season of injuries and erratic shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've just got to keep plugging away,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Even Jason Kidd has struggled. He's shooting just .387 from the  
field (12-for-31), 3-for-12 from 3-point range. He has 19 
hard-earned assists but only six rebounds, half his season average. 
He was 5-for-16 from the field Monday night, 0-for-8 in the second 
half. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a very physical series,'' Kidd said. ``They've put  
three or four different guys on me. We knew going into the series 
that they were going to try to wear me down. I've done everything I 
could do, trying to get the ball to the right guy, running the 
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	George McCloud said the Suns must get tough and quit letting the  
Blazers push them around. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our label anyway is that we're a finesse, soft team,'' McCloud  
said. ``We definitely need to be more aggressive, more physical. 
When they come to the hole to dunk, you've got to put them down. 
You've got to give him a hard foul. He may score but you've got to 
let him know he's got to pay the price.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amen, Ainge said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't care how many fouls you've got, no layups,'' Ainge  
said. ``We've got to have more guys play that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stoudamire said Kidd suffers from his own reputation and his  
huge role on the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jason has so much responsibility for that team and he does so  
many things for that team,'' Stoudamire said. ``Even when it looks 
like he's not playing as well as he should, he's still playing 
well. I just think that's what the expectations have become for 
Jason Kidd.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only bright spot for Phoenix has been its bench. The Suns  
reserves have outscored the deep and talented Portland bench 98-53 
in the first two games, 62-26 on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	But that is misleading because Portland's starters outscored the  
Suns starters 84-37 in Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our starters have had such good games,'' Blazers reserve point  
guard Greg Anthony said. ``The strength of our team is that we ride 
the hot hand. J.R. (Rider) has a big game in Game 1. In Game 2, 
Damon has a big game. I'm the first to say `Hey, let them keep 
going.' When you're going good, you've got to ride it.''

<HEADLINE> Dollar Rallies Vs. Euro, Others </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rallied against most major currencies  
Tuesday after rising against the euro, which was hit again by 
lowered expectations of peace in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was quoted at $1.0715 in late trading in New York, down  
from $1.0782 late Monday. The dollar rose to 120.97 Japanese yen 
from 120.50 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders have tied the euro's fortunes in recent weeks to the  
bombing in Kosovo, which begain in late March. Europe, with a 
stagnant economy, is expected to bear the brunt of the cost of 
rebuilding after the airstrikes end. 
</P>
<P>
	When Yugoslavia announced Monday that it was making a partial  
withdrawal of troops from Kosovo, the euro rose above $1.8000 for 
the first time in weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	But U.S. and NATO officials later said they saw no evidence of a  
withdrawal and continued heavy bombing on Tuesday. Traders dropped 
the euro and other currencies while buying dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	``The prospects for the war ending in Kovoso immediately have  
faded,'' said Anjum Sayyed, chief currency trader at the Buffalo, 
N.Y., office of Manufacturers &AMP; Traders Trust Co. ``That's given 
the dollar a boost and hurt the euro.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 94 points before  
falling and closing down about 4 points even as U.S. Treasury bond 
prices fell sharply, sending the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond 
yield up to 5.85 percent, a level not seen since last June. 
</P>
<P>
	Sayyed was optimistic about the dollar's performance after U.S.  
stocks failed to tank along with bond prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that the U.S. equity market has held up in the face  
of a weak bond market is giving (foreign) investors confidence that 
they can keep their assets invested in the U.S. equity market,'' 
Sayyed said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading Monday, the dollar was quoted at 1.5016 Swiss  
francs, up from 1.4899; and 1.4530 Canadian dollars, down from 
1.4613. 
</P>
<P>
	The British pound fell to $1.6234 from $1.6253.  
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on the euro's rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8255 German  
marks, up from 1.8139; 6.1237 French francs, up from 6.0827; and 
1,808.32 Italian lire, up from 1,795.33.

<HEADLINE> Patriots Stadium Bill Is Introduced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A bill allocating $70 million for a New England  
Patriots stadium was introduced Tuesday by Massachusetts House and 
Senate leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Paul Cellucci, House Speaker Thomas Finneran and Senate  
President Thomas Birmingham announced the filing of the bill at a 
Statehouse news conference. The bill would provide $70 million for 
such items as roads, sewers and other utilities. 
</P>
<P>
	The leaders said the bill could be the subject of a public  
hearing by Monday and then be passed by the House and Senate on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems as if the end zone is in reasonable sight,'' Finneran  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Patriots owner Robert Kraft was absent from the news conference.  
And the elected leaders said they had had no input from Kraft while 
working on the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	But the leaders said they worked closely with the NFL on the  
bill and were assuming that meant it would be acceptable to Kraft. 
They also said that parts of the bill were the same as a bill that 
Kraft had supported last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NFL, I'm sure, has been in contact with Mr. Kraft,''  
Cellucci said. ``I'm sure they didn't have two of their top guys 
sitting down with us ... for the fun of it. There's a reason why 
those people were there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL issued a statement, saying the bill filing was ``an  
important step toward preserving the Patriots in Massachusetts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We will study the impact of the proposed legislation and look  
forward to working closely with state officials to resolve any 
remaining issues promptly and cooperatively,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	The stadium is expected to cost $225 million and seat about  
68,000 fans. 
</P>
<P>
	The state will receive $1.4 million per year to help offset the  
cost of the infrastructure improvements: $400,000 from off-site 
parking operators located within three miles of the stadium and $1 
million from the team.

<HEADLINE> High-Speed Train Derails Under Tow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A train engine designed to power Amtrak into  
the high-speed rail business derailed last weekend as it was being 
towed out of the factory for testing. 
</P>
<P>
	One car in the eight-vehicle Acela train set came off the tracks  
Saturday and was pulled upright for about 500 feet before the 
engineer noticed and stopped, according to officials at Bombardier, 
the manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is uncertain of the cause, since the train was not  
under power. They are examining the quality of the tracks near the 
company's factory in Barre, Vt. 
</P>
<P>
	The car that derailed was a ``power car'' -- an engine. It was at  
the end of a standard Acela train set, which has power cars on the 
front and back and six coach cars in between. 
</P>
<P>
	New England Railway was towing the train set to the Northeast  
Corridor, which runs between Boston, New York and Washington, so 
Amtrak could begin testing the equipment on part of the route it is 
expected to start traveling by the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The train was to be run on the Keystone Line in Pennsylvania  
during the day and then on a stretch near Princeton, N.J., during 
the night for high-speed testing, Amtrak spokesman Rick Remington 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Another train set is in Pueblo, Colo., undergoing separate  
tests. Remington said it has hit 140 mph with no problems. He said 
the testing has resulted in ``just the normal tweaks'' to the train 
set. Amtrak has 20 sets on order. 
</P>
<P>
	Acela trains are designed to travel up to 150 mph and cut travel  
times between New York and Boston and New York and Washington to 
three hours. When the brand was unveiled earlier this year, Amtrak 
officials emphasized the system's safety, saying it exceeded the 
standards used in European high-speed rail systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Remington said he did not know how the derailment might affect  
the testing schedule until the completion of an inspection of the 
car back at the Bombardier plant. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been assured by Bombardier that they will do everything  
to keep it on schedule, and we're confident they will do so,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak has not formally accepted delivery of the train set, but  
Bombardier is under strict delivery deadlines. The trains must also 
meet speed-of-trip goals.

<HEADLINE> Buses a Safe Form of Transportation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite a run of deadly accidents, buses are  
generally a safe way to travel on the nation's highways, according 
to federal statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	On average, six people die in motor coach crashes each year. In  
1997, 22,000 people died in passenger car crashes, 2,100 were 
killed in motorcycle crashes and just over 700 died in large truck 
crashes on U.S. interstates and highways. 
</P>
<P>
	While the numbers may be coldly reassuring, recent images are  
not -- renewing concerns at the National Transportation Safety 
Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Last June, a Greyhound bus that veered off the Pennsylvania  
Turnpike and smashed into a parked tractor-trailer, killing seven. 
On Christmas Eve, a casino-bound charter that slid off an icy 
Garden State Parkway, killing eight. On Sunday, another casino bus 
swerving off a highway in New Orleans, killing 22. 
</P>
<P>
	The safety board is just completing a special investigation of  
bus crash-worthiness, and preliminarily it has found that the most 
dangerous aspect of a crash is passenger ejection, said Joe 
Osterman, head of highway safety for the NTSB. 
</P>
<P>
	That may prompt the five-member board to recommend new  
guidelines for the size or rigidity of bus windows -- especially in 
new coaches offering panoramic views of the landscape. 
</P>
<P>
	It's also triggered a discussion of seat belts in motor coaches.  
</P>
<P>
	While the federal government has required seat belts in  
passenger cars since 1968, it has never required them in any kind 
of bus, whether school buses, transit buses or motor coaches. The 
thinking has long been that with their size, height, padded seats 
and high seat backs, buses offer passengers a protective cocoon in 
the event of a crash. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem is that in a rollover, it creates flexing of the  
body (of the bus), which casts off windows,'' Osterman said. ``In a 
bus that creates some fairly significant portals where the 
passengers can come out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To date, the bus industry has cited the lack of research showing  
the benefit of seat belts. There is also concern that requiring 
seat belts might force the installation of stronger -- and more 
expensive -- seats and floors. 
</P>
<P>
	In Sunday's accident, a coach carrying elderly people headed for  
a Mississippi casino hurtled down an embankment off Interstate 610 
in New Orleans. Investigators were checking witness reports of a 
car possibly cutting off the bus, but they were also looking into 
the driver's medical history and driving record. 
</P>
<P>
	One witness said: ``People started flying out of the bus, flying  
out the windows.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A bus is technically any vehicle with more than 10,000 pounds  
gross vehicle weight that carries more than 10 people. That covers 
the spectrum from airport car rental vans to modern motor coaches, 
which carry up to 50 passengers and store their luggage in bays 
underneath. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the country, there are up to 4,000 motor coach companies,  
ranging from one-bus charter operations to Greyhound, a 2,100-bus 
company that provides the only regular nationwide service. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry has enjoyed 5 percent to 7 percent growth over the  
past six years, according to Peter Pantuso, president of the 
American Bus Association, which represents about two-thirds of the 
nation's bus fleet. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great way to travel. It's affordable, people can stay  
together,'' Pantuso said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sunday's accident was typical in many respects: Casinos are  
a top destination for buses, in many cases the deaths occur when 
the bus leaves the roadway and the deadliest of accidents usually 
involve passenger ejections. 
</P>
<P>
	NTSB Chairman Jim Hall wrote a letter to the transportation  
secretary in February calling for better bus brake inspections and 
a closer study of driver fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
	Toward that end, the agency is conducting three hearings this  
year focusing on oversight of the industry and safety technology. 
The board is also expected to consider recommending improvements in 
seat and interior compartment design. 
</P>
<P>
	It concedes the safety of buses, however.  
</P>
<P>
	``There is occasionally some competition between motor coaches  
and school buses as to which is safer,'' Osterman said. ``But they 
are the safest vehicles on the highway.''

<HEADLINE> Toymaker Lego Reports First Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) -- Danish toymaker Lego lost 194 million  
kroner, or $27.7 million, in 1998 for its first annual loss since 
the company was founded in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss, which had been expected, was attributed to increasing  
competition from electronic toys which cut deeply into sales of the 
company's famed interlocking plastic building blocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Lego chief executive Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen also blamed last  
year's turmoil on the Russian and Asian markets for the poor 
results. Russia had been seen as a growing market by the maker of 
the multicolored blocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The privately held company earned 470 million kroner in 1997.  
</P>
<P>
	Sales rose 0.8 percent to 7.7 billion kroner, or $1.1 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. market had become Lego's largest single market,  
representing nearly one-third of the Lego group's total sales. In 
Japan, sales had increased with 30 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Lego announced it would slash its workforce  
by up to 10 percent or 1,000 jobs worldwide. The new company 
structure would be ready before the summer and is expected to take 
effect in the second half of 1999, Lego said. 
</P>
<P>
	On March 20, Lego opened its third amusement park in Carlsbad,  
Calif. Headquartered in Billund, western Denmark, Lego also makes 
clothes, watches and educational products.

<HEADLINE> Nashville Sound: Montgomery Gentry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Remember country music's outlaw  
movement? Waylon and Willie, long hair and beards, drinking and 
drugs, and Southern rock crashing the clean-cut Nashville scene? 
</P>
<P>
	Well, 25 years have passed -- more than enough time for Nashville  
to digest and elevate the likes of Waylon Jennings and Willie 
Nelson to grand-old-man status. So where does outlaw music go for 
an encore? 
</P>
<P>
	Well, it can try Montgomery-Gentry, a duo that only months ago  
was a club act in Lexington, Ky., and is now being pushed by Sony 
Records as the next generation of outlaw musicians. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hillbilly Shoes'' sets their snarling tone: ``Ain't too much  
these boots can't do/Might even kick a little sense into you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eddie Montgomery, 35, dresses in black leather for an interview.  
He sports a goatee and shaves his head. Troy Gentry, 32, pulls up 
to Sony Records on an American Eagle motorcycle. Both men are large 
and imposing. 
</P>
<P>
	But if an outlaw is supposed to be surly or distant, Eddie and  
Troy don't make it. 
</P>
<P>
	An outlaw isn't supposed to sound excited when his album sells.  
Montgomery is. ``It's pretty wild, man,'' he says of the duo's 
debut album, ``Tattoos &AMP; Scars,'' selling more than 8,000 copies a 
week, according to SoundScan. 
</P>
<P>
	Gentry says he still isn't used to being recognized by audiences  
when he gets on stage. 
</P>
<P>
	Montgomery-Gentry's musical ambition is unmistakable: to emulate  
the heroes of the movement that incorporated Southern rock and 
brought country music a younger audience 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Outlaw music was ``real in-your-face, telling you stories about  
life,'' Montgomery said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Jennings singing ``Ladies Love Outlaws (Like Babies Love  
Stray Dogs),'' or teaming up with Nelson to sing ``Mamas Don't Let 
Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys.'' It was Tompall Glaser's 
self-mockingly sexist ``Put Another Log on the Fire,'' and Hank 
Williams Jr.'s defiant anthem, ``A Country Boy Can Survive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ``outlaw'' tag is generally credited to country music  
journalist Hazel Smith, who used it in the early 1970s. In 1978, 
RCA Records capitalized with ``Wanted! The Outlaws,'' a compilation 
of old material by Jennings, Nelson, Glaser and Jessi Colter. It 
became the first country music album to sell more than 1 million 
copies. 
</P>
<P>
	The original outlaw movement had an element of rebellion against  
the Nashville power structure. Artists like Nelson and Jennings got 
so popular that no one could stop them from wearing -- and playing -- 
what they pleased. And if Jennings brought a gun into the studio 
and threatened to shoot the fingers off any musician who didn't 
play with feeling, nobody was about to argue. 
</P>
<P>
	Two decades later, Nelson and Jennings are in their 60s, younger  
performers have moved to center stage and mainstream country music 
is largely clean-cut once again. 
</P>
<P>
	Travis Tritt is one of the few exceptions. Confederate Railroad  
revived the outlaw image in the early 1990s, but treated it 
humorously (dressing in drag for one video), and didn't last. 
</P>
<P>
	Enter Montgomery-Gentry.  
</P>
<P>
	Their rebellion doesn't extend to performing their own songs.  
Everything on ``Tattoos &AMP; Scars'' was written by others, although 
that's not unusual; some of the greatest outlaw hits were written 
for stars by less-than-household names. 
</P>
<P>
	``We write, but we'll never put a song on an album if it's not  
good enough,'' Montgomery said. ``We want the best songs 
representing us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That includes the gruffly wise title song ``Tattoos &AMP; Scars,''  
written by Tony Lane, in which a youngster shows off his tattoos in 
a bar, and an older man responds by displaying his scars and 
explaining the difference. ``Daddy Won't Sell the Farm'' is about a 
farmer fighting urban sprawl. 
</P>
<P>
	Montgomery and Gentry got their first taste of the big time in  
an early band called Young Country with Eddie's brother, John 
Michael Montgomery. John Michael kept them on as backup when 
``Life's a Dance'' made him a hot solo singer in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	When Eddie decided to develop his own act, he teamed with Gentry  
because they liked the same music and Gentry's rough tenor 
contrasted nicely with his own earthy growl. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniels gave them some instant credibility by performing on  
their recording of his anthem to partying, ``All Night Long.'' 
Daniels said their album was ``like a breath of fresh air.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Long ago, Jennings asked in song: ``Don't you think this outlaw  
bit's done got out of hand?'' Now it's up to the Montgomerys and 
Gentrys of Nashville to prove him wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in country music...  
</P>
<P>
	ACHY BREAKY SCOOBY: Billy Ray Cyrus has recorded the theme to  
``Scooby-Doo'' for use in the direct-to-video ``Scooby-Doo and the 
Witch's Ghost.'' The cartoon will be released this fall on Warner 
Home Video.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Panel Rejects Steel Tariffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Domestic stainless steel producers will  
consider appealing a federal agency's decision rejecting punitive 
tariffs on some stainless steel imports. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry had sought tariffs to curb imports of stainless  
round wire from Japan and five other countries. But the U.S. 
International Trade Commission rejected tariffs Monday, ruling 6-0 
that foreign pricing practices do not hurt American producers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department determined earlier that Canada, India,  
Japan, South Korea, Spain and Taiwan illegally dumped stainless 
round wire in U.S. markets at prices below production costs. A 
commission finding of threat or actual injury was the last step 
needed before Commerce could impose tariffs of up to 36 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	George Kurisky, chairman of the Stainless Wire Action Committee,  
said the industry will review the commission's written opinion, 
expected in a few weeks, before deciding whether to appeal to the 
U.S. Court of International Trade in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	He said steel-makers were disappointed and ``continue to believe  
that the data prove injury to a competitive and efficient American 
industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stainless round wire is a low-quantity but high-value product --  
a $300 million-a-year domestic industry, with imports adding 
another $100 million. It is used to produce springs, wire rope and 
fasteners in construction and other applications. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Commerce found that Japan dumped a more common steel  
product, hot-rolled carbon steel. Japanese representatives 
denounced the ruling as politicized and looked to the autonomous 
trade commission for what they consider will be a more independent 
review. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's ruling means that the federal government will refund  
deposits and bonds collected on stainless round wire since November 
to cover any tariffs applied retroactively. 
</P>
<P>
	The cases were filed by ACS Industries Inc. of Woonsocket, R.I.;  
Al Tech Specialty Steel Corp. of Dunkirk, N.Y.; Branford Wire &AMP; 
Manufacturing Co. of Mountain Home, N.C.; Carpenter Technology 
Corp. of Reading, Pa.; Handy &AMP; Herman Specialty Wire Group of 
Cockeysville, Md.; Industrial Alloys Inc. of Pomona, Calif.; Loos &AMP; 
Co. Inc. of Pomfret, Conn.; Sandvik Steel Co. of Clarks Summit, 
Pa.; Sumiden Wire Products Corp. of Stockton, Calif.; and Techalloy 
Co. Inc. of Mahwah, N.J.

<HEADLINE> Ariz. Gov. Hull Addresses GOP Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Arizona's female governor urged a group of  
prominent Republican women to help further the rise of women in 
American politics by moving from ``slogans to substance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The remarkable rise of women to political prominence in Arizona  
is one that could be repeated elsewhere in the country, Gov. Jane 
Hull told the Republican Women Leaders Forum, an organization of 
about 800 political and business leaders from 45 states. 
</P>
<P>
	Hull and four other women hold the top elected positions in  
Arizona, and are referred to as the ``Fab Five.'' Their power, Hull 
said, should be derived not merely from platitudes and slogans but 
from focusing on substantive issues and party unity. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way we do that is by sticking to the Republican agenda,''  
said Hull. ``That is how we will reach a point where electing 
women, especially Republican women, is commonplace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She stressed that women can move beyond ``women's' issues'' and  
win elections by focusing on Republican ideals. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most significant thing we can do,'' Hull said, ``is to  
continue the transition from symbolism to substance in American 
politics.''

<HEADLINE> Source: Gore To Name Campaign Chair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Off to a shaky start, Al Gore's presidential  
campaign team is getting a new leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Rep. Tony Coelho, a prominent Democratic strategist and  
architect of the party's failed 1994 midterm election strategy, is 
taking the top spot in the vice president's political operation, 
four officials familiar with the selection said Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the officials said Coelho's title will be campaign  
chairman. They all spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	His main task, these sources said, will be to give direction to  
a troika of interests inside the Gore team: The campaign staff, 
Gore's White House staff and his outside consultants. Gore aides 
and Democratic operatives have complained that the three interests 
do not always work well together -- and often are at odds. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore leads his only Democratic rival, former New Jersey Sen.  
Bill Bradley, by at least 20 percentage points in most public 
opinion polls. But he has been prone to gaffes, and slow to respond 
to the miscues, as Bradley has threatened to close the gap. 
</P>
<P>
	Polls also show Gore trailing early GOP favorite George W. Bush  
in head-to-head match-ups. 
</P>
<P>
	The hiring of a campaign chairman is not a surprise, though the  
Californian's name had not been mentioned in public before Monday. 
Officials said the move does not undercut Gore's consultants or top 
aides at the campaign and White House. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the advisers compared it to President Clinton's 1992  
campaign, when California lawyer Mickey Kantor was brought in to 
calm turf wars between the campaign staff and Clinton's political 
team in Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	Kantor became U.S. trade representative and commerce secretary  
under Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaign manager Craig Smith will continue to supervise the  
campaign staff and its budget. And the vice president's schedule 
and day-to-day operation will still be controlled by his White 
House chief of staff, Ron Klain. 
</P>
<P>
	Coelho, a former House majority whip, quit Congress in 1989 to  
avoid investigation into his personal finances. He has been an 
investment banker and lobbyist since leaving Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	While in Congress, Coelho was perhaps the most adroit political  
operator among the House Democrats. In the early 1980s, he 
transformed the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee into a 
modern and powerful organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Coehlo headed the Democratic election effort in 1994, when  
Republicans won control of both houses of Congress.

<HEADLINE> AOL Considers Net TV Possibilities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- America Online Inc. took preliminary steps  
Tuesday toward bringing its service to TV sets, announcing 
partnerships with companies to develop equipment that would allow 
access to the Internet through televisions. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL will join DirectTV, Hughes Network Systems, Philips  
Electronics and Network Computer Inc., to develop set-top boxes to 
connect televisions to the Internet by using satellite dishes, 
high-speed digital subscriber lines and 56K modems. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Schuler, president of America Online's Interactive  
Services Group, said the proposed system would also allow viewers 
to watch TV while surfing the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The targeted audience, he said, are the 17 million AOL  
subscribers who already access the service through personal 
computers. While the computer will still be the main device used to 
access the servcice, he said, AOL would like to expand onto other 
appliances in the home. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that this is a natural evolution of what is  
happening in the marketplace,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors welcomed the news, sending AOL's stock sharply higher  
Tuesday. AOL shares gained $13.12 1/2 or 10.2 percent to $141.43 3/4 as 
the most active issue Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry analysts saw the deals as a good first step toward  
AOL's goal of reaching viewers through other means besides the PC. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've pretty well maxed out the number of people signing up  
using computers,'' said Gerry Kaufhold, a multimedia and digital 
television analyst for Cahners In-Stat Group, a market research 
company for emerging technology in Boston. ``They have to expand 
their reach with a non-computer based solution before they get 
scooped by the broadband cable systems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kaufhold said AOL is getting pinched by AT&AMP;T, which is moving  
aggressively to provide high-speed hookups to the Internet using 
recently acquired cable systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``AOL is in a footrace,'' he said. ``It expands their turf from  
the 14-inch monitor in your den to the 36-inch TV in your living 
room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If AOL succeeds in drawing in more viewers, it could increase  
their advertiser base and revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	The boxes are scheduled to be available some time in 2000, but  
the price would be announced later, said Schuler.

<HEADLINE> Ikea Recalls Toy After Choking Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- The Ikea home and accessories company  
is recalling a stacking-rings toy after a 5-year-old child choked 
to death on a ball that came with it. 
</P>
<P>
	The toy, called the Mula ring pyramid, consists of brightly  
colored rings that are to be stacked on a dowel. The smallest piece 
is a ball about 1.5 inches in diameter. 
</P>
<P>
	Ikea issued the worldwide recall Tuesday after receiving a  
report that a child had choked to death when the ball became lodged 
in his throat. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fatal accident occurred in the beginning of January this  
year in a European country; in agreement with the boy's family I

<HEADLINE> Knoblauch Back in Yanks' Lineup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Chuck Knoblauch returned to the New York  
Yankees' lineup Tuesday night, five days after bruising his lower 
left leg while trying to turn a double play. 
</P>
<P>
	Knoblauch batted leadoff and played second base against Anaheim.  
He came back in time to face a tough pitcher for him -- he was only 
1-for-13 in his career against Angels starter Steve Sparks. 
</P>
<P>
	Knoblauch was injured when Minnesota's Corey Koskie rolled into  
him last Thursday at the Metrodome. Koskie was called out for 
interference while Knoblauch writhed on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Luis Sojo started at second base during a weekend series against  
Seattle and Chad Curtis batted leadoff. Yankees interim manager Don 
Zimmer was glad to see his All-Star able to play again. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as he didn't break nothing. It could have been a  
disaster,'' Zimmer said before Tuesday night's game. ``So here he 
is playing tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roger Clemens, however, will remain on the disabled list at  
least until the weekend because of a bad left hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens is eligible to come off the DL on Thursday. But Zimmer  
said the pitcher will not be activated until Saturday ``at the 
earliest.'' The Yankees play the Chicago White Sox this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he feels anything, we don't want him to pitch,'' Zimmer  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens is 2-0 despite a 5.47 ERA in five starts. He has won 17  
straight decisions since last season, tying the AL record. 
</P>
<P>
	With Clemens still out, Hideki Irabu was scheduled to start  
Thursday night and Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez was to pitch 
Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramiro Mendoza, meanwhile, will go back to the bullpen as a long  
reliever. He missed Sunday's start because of a viral infection. 
</P>
<P>
	``He hasn't pitched a bad game,'' Zimmer said. ``If Hideki can  
pitch well enough to stay in the rotation, we're a better team with 
Mendoza in the bullpen.''

<HEADLINE> Drs. Need Quick Response to Anthrax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Doctors need training on the symptoms of  
anthrax so they don't think an infected person just had a bad flu, 
according to scientists studying the possibility of a terrorist 
anthrax attack. 
</P>
<P>
	In a report being published in Wednesday's Journal of the  
American Medical Association, the Working Group on Civilian 
Biodefense says an anthrax attack could happen, and larger amounts 
of the vaccine need to be at the ready. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthrax is colorless, odorless, inexpensive to make and easy to  
transport. 
</P>
<P>
	The group cited a 1993 government report that said it would take  
only about 20 pounds of anthrax to kill 3 million people, the death 
toll equal or more than that which could result from a hydrogen 
bomb. 
</P>
<P>
	``The possibility of a terrorist attack using bioweapons would  
be especially difficult to predict, detect, or prevent, and thus it 
is among the most feared terrorist scenarios,'' the report says. 
</P>
<P>
	In an attack, nearly half of those infected would die within 24  
to 48 hours, probably well before doctors knew what was going on, 
the report says. Because anthrax infections can be controlled with 
antibiotics if administered very early, doctors and radiologists 
need to know what to look for, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortness of breath, an early sign of anthrax infection, could  
be mistaken for pneumonia. Other early symptoms include fever, 
cough, headache, vomiting, and chills, which could be mistaken for 
a bad flu. 
</P>
<P>
	``The trick here is to identify as quickly as possible and  
recommend antibiotic treatment of all those who might have been 
exposed ... and treat them for two months, which is a huge task,'' 
said Dr. D.A. Henderson, co-author of the report and director of 
the Center for Civilian Biodefense Studies at Johns Hopkins 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	The doctors found that anthrax remains deadly far longer than  
previously understood. It was believed that infection would occur 
within six days of exposure. But the group found the danger period 
lasts up to 46 days. Therefore, antibiotics need to be administered 
for two months. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthrax causes an infection outside the lungs that shows up on  
X-rays as a distinctive wide band down the middle of the chest. 
``Most radiologists would be unaware of this particular finding,'' 
Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	If an anthrax attack happens, doctors should use vaccines in  
combination with antibiotics, and cremation of bodies should be 
considered to prevent transmission. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson said the widespread use of the anthrax vaccine as a  
preventative is not recommended, unless a terrorist problem becomes 
real. In the meantime, efforts underway to produce large amounts of 
the vaccine should be stepped up so it will be ready if needed, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although biological agents have seldom been dispersed in aerosol  
form, the idea is not farfetched, the report said. It was tried 
without success in 1995 at a Tokyo subway station when the 
terrorist group Aum Shinrikyo released anthrax and botulism. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson said there are former Soviet scientists who have the  
expertise needed by well-funded terrorist groups to implement an 
attack. They know how to pick a harmful strain and mass produce so 
it lodges easily in the lungs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 17 nations are believed to have biological weapons  
programs, including Iraq and the former Soviet Union, but it is 
unknown how many are working with anthrax, the report said.

<P>
	On the stock market, investors took profits after the Nikkei  
index surged to close at 17,300.61 points on Thursday -- its highest 
finish since Oct. 24, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Nikkei's 17,000 level prompts selling, but the downside is  
seen solid,'' said Hiroichi Nishi, deputy general manager at Nikko 
Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese blue chips were mixed following the sluggish  
performance of their U.S. counterparts overnight on Wall Street and 
the yen's rise against the dollar Monday, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong yen tends to make Japanese exports more expensive and  
thus less competitive abroad, while making imports cheaper in 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 18.04 points, or 1.31 percent, to 1,355.82 
points. The TOPIX closed up 5.44 points, or 0.40 percent, Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar slipped on news late Monday  
that the Yugoslav army had announced a partial withdrawal of 
military and police forces in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	But trades remained in a narrow range in the absence of fresh  
incentives. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market today had no energy and was completely lifeless,''  
said Kenichi Hayashi, manager of the international treasury 
department at the Industrial Bank of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	There was little follow-through dollar selling Tuesday in the  
wake of the latest development in Kosovo, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 130.08 yen, up from  
129.38 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 212 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.340 percent from Monday's close of 1.335 percent, 
driving its price down to 104.08 yen from 104.13 yen.

<HEADLINE> Brown Says No Deal in Simpson Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- There is no agreement yet on the custody of  
O.J. Simpson's younger children, their grandfather said Tuesday, 
contradicting statements from Simpson's lawyer that he would retain 
custody. 
</P>
<P>
	Lou Brown, the father of Simpson's slain ex-wife, said,  
``Nothing has been agreed upon. ... There is no agreement. I can't 
say anything else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson's lawyer, Bernard Leckie, told The Associated Press on  
Monday that an agreement giving custody to Simpson was ready to be 
signed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know why the attorney was discussing it,'' Brown said.  
``It's supposed to be confidential.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown's lawyer did not return a phone call seeking comment.  
Simpson was out of town and couldn't be reached. 
</P>
<P>
	The children, Justin, 10, and Sydney, 13, live with Simpson.  
Brown and his wife, Juditha, sued for custody and lost until an 
appeals court interceded. 
</P>
<P>
	The California Supreme Court ruled in February the custody case  
could go back to court for another trial. But Leckie said Monday 
that Simpson would keep custody of the children in a settlement 
with the Browns.

<HEADLINE> Embryo Test Finds Sickle Cell Gene </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Parents who carry the gene for sickle cell anemia  
can now ensure their children will be free of the disease by using 
test-tube fertilization and having the embryos genetically analyzed 
before they are implanted. 
</P>
<P>
	The procedure allows parents to use an embryo free of the  
devastating gene, guaranteeing they will not pass on the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the genetic diagnosis, children of two sickle cell  
carriers have a 25 percent chance of developing the disease and a 
50 percent chance of being a carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	The technique is already used to prevent other hereditary  
disorders such as cystic fibrosis and Tay-Sachs disease. 
</P>
<P>
	It was successfully applied to sickle cell carriers for the  
first time last year. Two embryos screened through the process are 
now healthy twins free of sickle cell disease and the gene defect 
that causes it, according to researchers. 
</P>
<P>
	They reported their findings in Wednesday's Journal of the  
American Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, parents who were sickle cell carriers had to wait  
until 10 weeks into pregnancy for a test to indicate whether their 
fetus inherited the defect and would develop sickle cell anemia. 
The disease can be passed on only if both parents are carriers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Up to now, couples who had affected fetuses could only deal  
with it by having an induced abortion,'' said Dr. Zev Rosenwaks, 
the study's principal investigator. Rosenwaks directs the Center 
for Reproductive Medicine and Infertility at Cornell University's 
Weill Medical College, which collaborated with Dr. Mark Hughes of 
Wayne State University in Detroit on developing the test. 
</P>
<P>
	Sickle cell anemia, which mostly affects blacks, is one of the  
most common inherited genetic disorders. One in 625 black children 
is afflicted. 
</P>
<P>
	The life-shortening disease results from an abnormality in  
hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying pigment in blood. The defect 
distorts red cells into the shape of sickles. 
</P>
<P>
	Symptoms start as early as six months after birth and include  
fatigue, headaches, organ damage, seizures and strokes. Sickle cell 
anemia also increases a person's vulnerability to infections. No 
cure has been found. 
</P>
<P>
	The technique the researchers used is called pre-implantation  
genetic diagnosis, or PGD. It allows researchers to study genetic 
traits in embroys even when they are made up of only six to eight 
cells. 
</P>
<P>
	The procedure has been used for about 10 years in parents with  
gene traits for similarly inherited disorders, such as cystic 
fibrosis, Tay-Sachs disease and thalassemia, which also involves 
hemoglobin. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've done at least 12 different diseases,'' said Dr. Charles  
M. Strom, medical director of the Reproductive Genetics Institute 
at Illinois Masonic Hospital in Chicago. He was not involved in 
this study. 
</P>
<P>
	Strom said his institute also used PGD to prevent sickle cell  
disease in a baby born last October. 
</P>
<P>
	The technique is expensive and performed at only a few medical  
facilities. In vitro fertilization costs $8,000 to $12,000 per 
attempt, and the PGD test is $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Oswaldo Castro, director of the Sickle Cell Disease Center  
at Howard University in Washington, said he is opposed to using PGD 
to select embryos because it means other embryos are passed over. 
Some are destroyed, and others are frozen for possible future 
implantation. 
</P>
<P>
	``As I treat a lot of patients with sickle cell, it's difficult  
for me to put a judgment, `Well, this one should never have been 
born,''' Castro said.

<HEADLINE> US Launches Youth Violence Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- High school student Simonna Woodson believes  
the soon-to-be-launched White House campaign against youth violence 
will strike a chord with her peers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that they had young people at the meeting and were  
listening to us and asking our opinion, I'm pretty sure that makes 
my peers sit up and listen,'' said Woodson, a 17-year-old junior at 
Arsenal Technical High School in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	Woodson joined President Clinton and about 60 of the nation's  
leading educators, officials, entertainers and gun advocates on 
Monday to brainstorm ways to reduce violence among youth. 
</P>
<P>
	As the group-- including poet Maya Angelou, America Online chief  
Steve Case and movie-industry lobbyist Jack Valenti -- left the 
White House, they spoke of unity and communal responsibility. 
Outside of instant commitments to limit youngsters access to 
violent video games on the Internet and proposals to strengthen 
existing gun laws and craft an advertising campaign against teen 
violence, participants hoped the most immediate outcome of Monday's 
three-hour closed-door session would be showing the nation's 
schools and the children in them that they are not alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a general sensitivity to the fact that schools are  
where the children are, but that people outside schools are going 
to have to be involved in helping seriously,'' said Education 
Secretary Richard W. Riley. ``It's not enough to say schools `you 
can take care of it.''' 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., applauded Clinton for  
holding the meeting and urged more discussions to ``figure out 
what's ailing our society and how we can correct it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, there were some dissident voices, including the  
National Rifle Association, which was not invited to the White 
House event. The gun-owners' lobbying group ran newspaper ads 
accusing the government of failing to enforce laws already on the 
books. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the April 20 massacre at Columbine High School in  
Littleton, Colo., where two students killed 12 classmates and a 
teacher before shooting themselves, everything from easy access to 
guns to violent movies and video games to a general culture of 
cynicism has been blamed. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollywood and gunmakers had particularly felt the sting.  
</P>
<P>
	But Monday, actor Andrew Shue, former star of the racy nighttime  
soap opera ``Melrose Place'' said, ``There was no scapegoating at 
all in any form. You just can't point the finger at one thing. It's 
parenting. It's schools. It's the kind of leadership we have. It 
goes on and on and on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Singer Gloria Estefan said the group's mission is not to censor  
music or anything else: ``Everyone is responsible. That was the 
consensus in there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among results of the meeting:  
</P>
<P>
	-- AOL and the video game industry agreed to stop allowing  
children to buy violent video games over the Internet that they are 
too young to buy in stores. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The American Shooting Sports Council, representing 350  
firearms manufacturers and distributors, endorsed a five-point 
administration gun-control plan, including background checks for 
firearms bought at gun shows and increasing the minimum age for 
buying a gun to 21. 
</P>
<P>
	-- A nonprofit group will be chosen to direct a national campaign  
against youth violence modeled on previous campaigns to curb 
teen-age pregnancy and to find jobs for welfare recipients. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Surgeon General David Satcher will prepare a report on the  
causes of youth violence, the first since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley said the meeting yielded school-based proposals including  
smaller classes, more teachers, and more guidance counselors. Vice 
president Al Gore said that in the home, families should address 
domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``The painful lessons that children learn from seeing domestic  
violence ... are far more powerful in the impact on those children 
than the imagery they see in the media,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting comes three weeks after one of the worst school  
shootings in recent history. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's wife, Tipper, said Littleton ``was symbolic for so many  
of us and such a tragedy and a wake-up call'' but that ``there have 
been little massacres going on in our society for years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woodson, the Indianapolis student, believes the meeting was  
another kind of wake-up call: ``Students will realize that more 
people care about them. And maybe they won't resort to violent acts 
or other things that they do because they're trying to attract 
attention.''

<HEADLINE> Law Officer Deaths Drop in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sixty-one law enforcement officers were  
murdered on duty in the United States during 1998, a decline of 
almost 13 percent from the previous year, the FBI reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Releasing preliminary figures for 1998, the FBI said nine fewer  
officers were slain at work last year than the 70 killed in 1997. 
The drop is consistent with a nationwide decline in all types of 
crime since the mid-1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Firearms continued to be the most frequent weapon for killing  
officers, with handguns accounting for 40 of the murders in 1998, 
rifles for 17 and a shotgun for 1. The other three were attributed 
to a vehicle, a blunt instrument and a bomb. 
</P>
<P>
	Arrest situations produced 16 of the murders: seven officers on  
drug-related investigations, six serving arrest warrants and three 
attempting to prevent robberies or catch robbers. Another 16 
officers were killed while answering disturbance calls. 
</P>
<P>
	An additional 10 murders were ambushes, nine came while  
enforcing traffic laws, six while investigating suspicious persons 
or circumstances and 4 while guarding prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
	Southern states saw the largest number of murders, 29, followed  
by Western states with 14, Midwestern states with 10, Northeastern 
states with three and Puerto Rico with five. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-four of the officers were wearing body armor when they  
died. Six were slain with their own weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	The 61 murders occurred in 55 separate incidents, and arrests  
have been made in 51 of them. Five suspects remain at large. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, accidental deaths of officers on duty rose by 15,  
from 62 in 1997 to 77 in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Silas Takes 4-Year Hornets' Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Paul Silas has accepted a four-year, $6  
million deal to coach the Charlotte Hornets. 
</P>
<P>
	Silas, an assistant to Dave Cowens who took over as interim  
coach in March after Cowens resigned, agreed to the contract 
Monday, a source connected with the team told The Associated Press 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract includes a guaranteed $4.5 million over three  
years, with an optional fourth year, according to media reports. 
</P>
<P>
	A news conference was called today for an announcement. Team  
owner George Shinn and Silas were to attend, a team spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Silas put together a 22-13 record as interim coach, turning  
around a team that had one of the league's worst records when 
Cowens left. Still, the Hornets' failed to reach the playoffs for 
the first time since 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Cowens resigned over frustration with his salary, which ranked  
last in the league two of the three years he was with Charlotte. 
Cowens was paid an average of $628,000 per season with the Hornets. 
</P>
<P>
	Silas guided the old San Diego Clippers to a 78-168 mark in  
three seasons as their head coach immediately after completing a 
16-year NBA career. Silas also has been an assistant with New 
Jersey, New York and Phoenix.

<HEADLINE> 91-Year-Old Sentenced in Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) -- Despite a plea from the victim, a  
judge refused to jail a 91-year-old man who shot his 85-year-old 
neighbor at a senior citizens complex because he thought the man 
was annoying. 
</P>
<P>
	Leodore P. Menard, who pleaded guilty in the June 1998 shooting,  
told authorities he shot Robert H. Bell in the knee to get him back 
for being annoying. 
</P>
<P>
	At Monday's sentencing, Bell urged the judge to jail Menard,  
saying Menard would surely be jailed if he were younger. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Thomas Curley agreed that a young adult would probably be  
headed to state prison, but the judge placed Menard on five years 
probation because of concerns about his health. Menard had not 
violated a law since 1925. 
</P>
<P>
	Menard, who had faced 10 years in prison on the conviction of  
assault and battery with a dangerous weapon on a person over the 
age of 65, can no longer care for himself and is confined to a 
nursing home, his lawyer said.

	Stocks End Higher; Dow Up 18.90  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A disappointing Treasury auction undercut a  
powerful rally in blue-chip stocks today, leaving them only 
modestly higher. But the broader market advanced unscathed on the 
strength of Internet stocks. The Dow Jones industrial average was 
up 18.90 at 11,026.15, just shy of its record high close of 
11,031.59 last Friday. The Dow was up 94 points in early afternoon 
when the Treasury announced it had sold $15 billion of five-year 
notes at 5.367 percent, an 11-month high, in the first leg of a 
two-day auction. The announcement sent the 30-year Treasury bond, 
which was already down for the day, even lower. Its yield, which 
moves opposite the price, was up to 5.83 percent from 5.79 percent 
late Monday, making bond yields more competitive with stocks and 
sending equities prices tumbling. Broader Based measures were 
higher. The Nasdaq Composite Index gained 40.27 to 2,566.66.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Santa isn't set to arrive for seven more months,  
but it sure looks like Christmas right now at the nation's toys 
stores. Thanks to the lineup of much-awaited ``Star Wars'' 
merchandise and continued demand for anything tied to Pokemon and 
Furby, toy shops -- both big and small -- say business is booming 
during what is typically the slowest time of the year. That's good 
news following a disappointing 1998, when a shortage of blockbuster 
hits caused sales of toys to fall. Spring usually is quite slow for 
toy retailers, who make the majority of their money during the 
fourth quarter as consumers buy gifts for the holidays.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's productivity rose at a

as the economy continued to demonstrate an ability to generate 
rapid growth without inflation. The Labor Department reported today 
that productivity, measured as the amount of output per hour of 
work, climbed at an annual rate of 4 percent in the January-March 
quarter, fully 1 percentage point higher than private economists 
had been expecting. ``The new economic paradigm still lives,'' said 
Marilyn Schaja, economist at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. 
``Because of strong productivity gains, economic activity can take 
place at a strong pace without a surge in inflationary pressures.''

cities and rural areas. ``We don't have to leave anyone behind,'' 
he said. Clinton arrived here with 15 business leaders for a 
roundtable discussion on bolstering private investment in 
economically distressed communities. They toured the Sweet Auburn 
Curb Market, located near the Martin Luther King Jr. historic 
district, to see an example of the economic development he hopes to 
generate in other areas. While there, Clinton sampled sweet potato 
cheesecake from one vendor and coffee from another.

<HEADLINE> 1M Infants To Get Classical CDs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COPPELL, Texas (AP) -- Air piano is the newest game at Children's  
World. With arms and fingers outstretched, children at the day care 
center bang on imaginary keyboards to the flourishes of Mozart. 
</P>
<P>
	John Flohr, a music professor who volunteers at the center,  
thinks using classical music to get kids to engage their senses 
stimulates brain activity, though he can't say for sure whether 
Mozart, Beethoven and Bach make kids smarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The parents of more than 1 million babies around the country are  
getting the chance to find out. 
</P>
<P>
	They will receive free classical music CDs from the people who  
dole out the Grammys. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences  
Foundation began providing the CDs of Grammy-winning music to 
babies in hundreds of hospitals. Mead Johnson Nutritionals, which 
makes Enfamil infant formula, is providing $3 million for the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
	The project is intended to give children ``every scientific and  
cultural advantage possible,'' said Michael Greene, president and 
chief executive of the academy. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Smart Symphonies'' CDs will be distributed for about a  
year in hospitals where Enfamil diaper bags are given free to new 
moms. The music also is available on Mead Johnson's consumer hot 
line at (800) BABY-123. 
</P>
<P>
	Flohr, who teaches at Texas Woman's University and was a  
consultant on the Grammy project, has led several studies 
indicating that certain music stimulates brain activity. Music may 
stimulate neural connections in the brain and promote spatial 
ability and memory, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most early childhood specialists agree that music generally is  
good for infants, said David Moore, a professor of psychology at 
Pitzer College in Claremont, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is very little doubt that every experience a baby has  
affects the structure of a baby's brain,'' he said. ``But there's 
no reason to say it's going to raise the baby's IQ. That is 
determined by many factors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Georgia last year, then-Gov. Zell Miller arranged for  
hospitals to give new parents tapes and CDs of classical music. 
</P>
<P>
	In Texas, Flohr will lead a study on the effect of the Grammy CD  
on dozens of 3- to 5-year-olds in San Antonio. The brain activity 
of children who listen to the CD several hours a day will be 
compared with that of other youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
	At Children's World, children may not understand the difference  
between Beethoven and Barney, but they know they're having fun when 
Flohr shows up to teach. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't just listen to the music now,'' said teacher Gladys  
Monsante, whose 2-year-old son attends the center. ``They 
participate. ``They become part of the music. And at the same time 
they are learning.''

	U.S. Ambassador Leaves Embassy  
</P>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- U.S. Ambassador James Sasser left his battered  
embassy compound Wednesday morning as four days of protests 
subsided and China mournfully brought home the remains of three 
journalists killed in the NATO bombing of its embassy in 
Yugoslavia. The remains were returned hours after protests ebbed 
and state television for the first time aired U.S. and NATO 
apologies. Vice President Hu Jintao greeted the relatives of 
victims as they stepped on to the airport tarmac carrying urns and 
photographs. The more than 20 diplomats and embassy staff members 
wounded in the bombing also arrived and ambulances whisked them to 
hospitals.

	NATO Airstrikes Continue  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO continued its airstrikes on  
Yugoslavia on Tuesday, saying it does not believe Serb forces are 
being withdrawn from Kosovo. At least seven people were killed in 
the attacks, Serb media said. NATO said there was no evidence 
Yugoslavia had withdrawn any of the estimated 40,000 troops and 
special police from the province. In Washington, Defense Secretary 
William Cohen said NATO will accept nothing less than a total 
withdrawal of forces from Kosovo as part of its conditions to halt 
the air campaign.

	White House Site Temporarily Down

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House Web site was taken off line  
after hackers reportedly angered by the NATO bombing of the Chinese 
Embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, broke into the system. White House 
spokesman Barry Toiv confirmed that the site was shut down Monday 
evening for at least 24 hours after ``an attempt was made ... to 
break into the system that operates the White House Web page.'' NBC 
News reported that the hackers were based in Hong Kong and that 
they left behind cyber graffitti critical of the ongoing NATO 
operation in Kosovo.

	EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) -- Scotland's biggest parties failed  
again to reach an agreement on a coalition government Tuesday, as 
the country prepared for the opening of its first Parliament in 300 
years. After a marathon session of bargaining, the Labor and 
Liberal Democrat parties departed with key issues unresolved, 
including the Liberal Democrats' commitment to abolish university 
tuition fees. Coalition talks will resume Wednesday, after the 
Parliament officially opens with a swearing-in ceremony and 
presiding-officer elections.

even as they struggle against AIDS, the World Health Organization 
said Tuesday. Noncommunicable diseases such as the world's top 
three killers -- heart disease, strokes and respiratory infections -- 
are expected to account for almost 75 percent of world illness by 
2020, up from 43 percent last year, according to the agency's 
annual World Health Report. The study also found that AIDS has 
displaced tuberculosis as the world's deadliest infectious disease.

<HEADLINE>  Armstrong Wins NBA Sixth Man Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Darrell Armstrong hoisted the trophy and  
smiled for photographers. When he lowered the NBA's Sixth Man award 
back to the table, he sighed. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's my weightlifting for today,'' the 6-foot-1, 180-pound  
guard said, flexing his arms. ``This thing is pretty heavy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fifth-year pro who helped the Orlando Magic to the  
second-best record in the Eastern Conference was honored Monday as 
the league's best player who came off the bench in more games than 
he started. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, a football placekicker in college who played in five  
different pro basketball leagues before finally catching on with 
the NBA, averaged career-highs in points (13.8), assists (6.7), 
rebounds (3.6), steals (2.16) and minutes per game (30) while 
appearing as a reserve in 35 of 50 games. 
</P>
<P>
	He led the Magic in assists and fourth-quarter scoring (4.5) and  
made 161 of 178 shots from the foul line to rank third in the 
league in free-throw percentage (.904). 
</P>
<P>
	``When you look at rosters at sixth and seventh men, there are a  
lot of very good ones in the league,'' general manager John Gabriel 
said. ``But there are few who can come in and create immediate 
change. Darrell has done that with us. He changes tempo. He changes 
momentum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, 30, was undrafted in 1991 after finishing his college  
career at Fayetteville State where he was also a kicker on the 
football team. He played in the Global Basketball Association, 
Continental Basketball Association and United States Basketball 
League, as well as overseas in Cyprus and Spain before signing with 
the Magic in April 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	During one brief stretch when he was out of basketball, he  
worked in a yarn mill in North Carolina for $250 a week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those are days I'll never forget,'' said Armstrong, who signed  
a five-year, $18 million contract before this season. ``The long 
rides with 12 players packed in a van, sitting on top of luggage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And while this been a breakthrough year in terms of national  
exposure, he emerged as key player for the Magic last season when 
he was averaging 9.2 points and 4.9 assists before a torn rotator 
cuff in his right shoulder sidelined him after 48 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were a lot of people who doubted me, who didn't think  
I'd come back from the injury ... I didn't really know it was 
career-threatening,'' Armstrong said. ``After all that I've been 
through, it's easy to go out and play hard every night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Injuries to other key players forced Armstrong into the starting  
lineup late in the season. He had 18 points, six assists, five 
rebounds and two steals Sunday in Orlando's 104-90 loss to 
Philadelphia in the opening game of their first-round playoff 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some guys think you have to start to be effective, or that you  
have to get up a sweat before you play well,'' Armstrong said. 
``You can't wait on that. You've got to play right away. That's how 
I've always approached it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong received 85 out of a possible 118 votes from a panel  
of sports writers and broadcasters. 
</P>
<P>
	Rasheed Wallace of the Portland Trail Blazers finished second  
with 16 votes, and Indiana's Antonio Davis and Jalen Rose tied for 
third with five votes each.

<HEADLINE> AOL Considers Net TV Possibilities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- America Online Inc. took preliminary steps  
Tuesday toward bringing its service to TV sets, announcing 
partnerships with companies to develop equipment that would allow 
access to the Internet through televisions. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL will join DirectTV, Hughes Network Systems, Philips  
Electronics and Network Computer Inc., to develop set-top boxes to 
connect televisions to the Internet by using satellite dishes, 
high-speed digital subscriber lines and 56K modems. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Schuler, president of America Online's Interactive  
Services Group, said the proposed system would also allow viewers 
to watch TV while surfing the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The targeted audience, he said, are the 17 million AOL  
subscribers who already access the service through personal 
computers. While the computer will still be the main device used to 
access the servcice, he said, AOL would like to expand onto other 
appliances in the home. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that this is a natural evolution of what is  
happening in the marketplace,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors welcomed the news, sending AOL's stock sharply higher  
Tuesday. AOL shares gained $13.12 1/2 or 10.2 percent to $141.43 3/4 as 
the most active issue Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry analysts saw the deals as a good first step toward  
AOL's goal of reaching viewers through other means besides the PC. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've pretty well maxed out the number of people signing up  
using computers,'' said Gerry Kaufhold, a multimedia and digital 
television analyst for Cahners In-Stat Group, a market research 
company for emerging technology in Boston. ``They have to expand 
their reach with a non-computer based solution before they get 
scooped by the broadband cable systems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kaufhold said AOL is getting pinched by AT&AMP;T, which is moving  
aggressively to provide high-speed hookups to the Internet using 
recently acquired cable systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``AOL is in a footrace,'' he said. ``It expands their turf from  
the 14-inch monitor in your den to the 36-inch TV in your living 
room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If AOL succeeds in drawing in more viewers, it could increase  
their advertiser base and revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	The boxes are scheduled to be available some time in 2000, but  
the price would be announced later, said Schuler.

fourth inning with a slightly strained right hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez left after hitting a solo home run, his eighth of the  
season. He also scored a run after doubling in his first at-bat. 
Gonzalez has 29 RBIs this season, including 22 in the last 17 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez, who was replaced by Roberto Kelly, is day to day.

<HEADLINE>  Jazz Cry Foul Over Webber's Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST VALLEY CITY, Utah (AP) -- Karl Malone has been in trouble  
more times than he can count for his zealously physical play. Now 
he's wondering why Chris Webber isn't in the same fix. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a double standard, without a doubt,'' Malone said.  
</P>
<P>
	Just nine seconds into Sacramento's 101-90 win over the Jazz on  
Monday night, Webber lowered his shoulder and slammed John Stockton 
to the floor, knocking the wind out of the much smaller guard. 
Webber was assessed a flagrant foul but nothing else, and he 
flattened Stockton again on a pick late in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	As Utah practiced Tuesday morning before traveling to Sacramento  
for Game 3, the Jazz -- and Malone in particular -- were still 
smarting from Webber's big hits. After the game, Webber admitted he 
had targeted Stockton for punishment while trying to set a physical 
tone. 
</P>
<P>
	``What if Karl Malone did that and said, `I tried to do that?'  
'' Malone said. ``What do you think the league would do?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Malone has been suspended twice in the last two seasons for his  
aggressive play. Most recently, a hard elbow to Joe Kleine's face 
split the Phoenix center's lip April 26 and required Kleine to get 
30 stitches and plastic surgery. Malone wasn't fined or suspended 
for the hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Webber or Charles Barkley, who admitted trying to hurt  
Stockton during the Rockets' first-round playoff loss to the Jazz 
last year, Malone said he has never set out to deliberately injure 
another team's player. His kind of contact is simply the result of 
physical, legal play. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're going to do that, hit a big guy,'' Malone said.  
``That's when you show you're a man. Don't hit a little guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rod Thorn, the NBA's senior vice president of operations, was  
traveling Tuesday and could not be contacted. It was not known if 
Thorn was reviewing the play, NBA spokesman Chris Brienza said. 
</P>
<P>
	Immediately after the game, Utah coach Jerry Sloan, a hard-nosed  
guard during 10 seasons with the Chicago Bulls, expressed a 
grudging admiration for Webber's move. But Sloan also had a 
different take on the incident after viewing tapes of the game 
Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``If that's something you have to do to play basketball, I think  
that's sad,'' Sloan said. ``If he'd done that to Karl Malone, I'd 
have tremendous respect for the guy ... but you don't take on a guy 
like that when he's so much smaller than you. That's the kind of 
stuff the league was going through with Dennis Rodman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stockton was uncharacteristically slow to get up after both  
hits. The 15-year veteran is well-known for his hard picks, and has 
endured accusations of dirty play as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not that I'm not used to getting knocked around,''  
Stockton said. ``This game isn't about whether you out-cheap-shot 
the other team, but if they want to play it that way, then that's 
their business. I'm not happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta's Dikembe Mutombo also has angered the Detroit Pistons  
with his liberal use of his elbows during their first-round playoff 
series. Mutombo and Malone have been among the players most often 
accused of dirty play in the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Malone stopped short of calling for retaliation against Webber  
but left little doubt the Jazz won't back down. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to say what I'm going to do,'' Malone said after  
a long pause. ``I'm going to go play the game, and whatever 
happens, happens. ... You can't allow someone to do that to our 
players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Similar words were said after Barkley clotheslined Stockton last  
season and the Jazz fell behind 2-1. Instead of retaliating, the 
Jazz got back at Houston by winning the final two games and 
advancing to the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're not going to do any good responding to something like  
that,'' Sloan said. ``I'm not looking for anybody to do anything 
crazy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Kings seemed to respond to Webber's tone-setting hit. After  
a 30-point blowout loss that opened the series, Sacramento led 
through most of Game 2 and held off the Jazz down the stretch with 
back-to-back hook shots from Webber. 
</P>
<P>
	Sloan blamed his own team's poor shooting and defense -- not  
Webber's hit -- for Utah's loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really think they would have played well without him doing  
that.''

<HEADLINE> Family and Medical Leave Has Limits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Q: Can anyone take time off for personal reasons under the  
Family and Medical Leave Act? 

</P>
<P>
	A: The 1993 Family and Medical Leave Act has helped an estimated  
20 million Americans get time off from work to care for a sick 
family member or new baby, or during their own serious illness. But 
the law has restrictions, and it's not open to all. 
</P>
<P>
	Generally, you can take up to 12 weeks off -- all at once or  
intermittently -- during a year if you work for a company that 
employs 50 or more people. You have to work a minimum of 1,250 
hours a year, which is the equivalent of at least 25 hours a week 
for 50 weeks, in the year before your leave. Vacation time doesn't 
count. 
</P>
<P>
	Teachers and top executives, however, aren't as free as others  
to take the time whenever they like. 
</P>
<P>
	School districts may ask teachers to coordinate their returns in  
a way that doesn't disrupt classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	Executives in the top 10 percent of a company's pay scale may  
not have their jobs guaranteed if their leave harms the firm. But 
the company has the burden of proof. 
</P>
<P>
	You also can't take this kind of leave to care for your third  
cousin-once-removed. If you, your parent, spouse or your child is 
seriously ill or you have or adopt a new baby, you can apply. But 
if your mother-in-law is ill, your spouse must take the leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all sicknesses fit the bill, either. The law mandates time  
off for people with ``serious health conditions.'' That means 
anyone who is hospitalized, but it also means people who need 
continuing medical treatment. You may be able to leave if you have 
severe morning sickness or a back problem, and you can take leave 
to drive your father to physical therapy after his stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	The law may seem a bit confusing, but it's a blessing for people  
who need time off. 
</P>
<P>
	If you need help figuring it out, check with your human  
resources department or the National Partnership for Women &AMP; 
Families, a nonprofit group that helped draft the law. The 
Partnership Web site (www.nationalpartnership.org) has a wealth of 
information on the law. 
</P>
<P>
	If you think your rights have been violated, find an employment  
lawyer or call the Labor Department's Wage and Hour Department 
information line at 1-800-959-FMLA.

<HEADLINE> Energy Dept. Upgrades Security Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Stung by an espionage scandal, Energy  
Secretary Bill Richardson said Tuesday he will halt the 
administration's aggressive declassification of Cold War-era 
nuclear documents. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's critical that we guard our secrets more thoroughly,'' he  
said in an interview, and there has been some concern that the 
declassification program was moving too fast. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson also said he will consolidate the department's $800  
million widely dispersed security operation under a single 
``security czar,'' who will report directly to him, and will impose 
new restrictions on access to the most secure computer systems at 
the national nuclear laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
	Criticism has been widespread in Congress about security  
problems at the government's nuclear weapons research labs and 
reports of theft of nuclear secrets -- in the 1980s and possibly as 
late as 1995 -- at the Los Alamos lab in New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Intelligence specialists have argued that part of the security  
problems stems from the wide array of declassified weapons-related 
data that is exchanged among scientists. Growing alarm about theft 
as well as access to information on the Internet has sparked 
re-examination of the rush to declassify. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's some concern that we're moving too fast,'' said  
Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
	He said there will be an 18-month moratorium on the aggressive  
declassification efforts involving defense-related documents that 
were ordered by former Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary during 
President Clinton's first term. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're reversing that. We believe it's critical that we guard  
our secrets more thoroughly,'' Richardson said. He said the program 
would be reviewed over the next 18 months with plans ``to slow down 
some of the declassification.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Department has been criticized in the past for its  
secretiveness. When O'Leary became secretary in 1993, she overruled 
reservations from some of the DOE's defense and security experts 
and began an aggressive move toward more openness. Declassification 
efforts were stepped up further after the disclosure in 1993 of 
improper radiation experiments on people in the early days of the 
Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, 10 congressional committees are looking into Energy  
Department security lapses and the administration's handling of the 
Los Alamos espionage case, which has focused on alleged activities 
dating back to the 1980s of a Taiwan-born scientist. The scientist, 
Wen Ho Lee, was fired March 8 for security violations but has not 
been charged with a crime. He has denied he ever provided secrets 
to China or anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
	A voluminous still-secret congressional report detailing  
widespread security problems at the labs -- including details about 
the Lee investigation -- is expected to be made public next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to blunt some of the attacks, Richardson said Tuesday he  
is streamlining the department's security efforts under one office, 
headed by a ``security czar'' who will have ``juice and clout'' and 
report directly to him. No one has been named, but Richardson said 
he wants ``a three-star general with extensive security 
background.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a dramatic change because it consolidates all the  
security empires at the DOE that have not coordinated with each 
other into one single unit accountable to me,'' Richardson said. 
The counterintelligence office would remain separate, also 
reporting directly to the secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody's been willing to tackle these very thorny security  
problems. The time has come,'' Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new security office also will consolidate computer security  
programs that currently are split between two offices, one 
responsible for classified systems and the other for unclassified 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators recently found at Los Alamos that more than 1,000  
files of top-secret nuclear weapons codes were found in an 
unsecured computer belonging to Lee, the scientist dismissed on 
March 8. It is believed the consolidation of security offices might 
reduce the risks of such transfers in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Richardson reinforced the department's  
counterintelligence office and directed that it report directly to 
him. To head the office, he hired Ed Curran, a former CIA official 
and still one of the FBI's top counterintelligence experts.

<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- International Management Group wants him.  
So do three or four other individual agents. Carlos Franco has an 
answer for them all. 
</P>
<P>
	Gracias, but no.  
</P>
<P>
	Franco, who became only the second player from South America --  
and the first from Paraguay -- to win on the PGA Tour, prefers to 
cut his own deals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm my own boss,'' he said Tuesday at the GTE Byron Nelson  
Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	That means not being tied down to corporate outings or feeling  
pressure to play certain events. Franco can take three weeks off if 
he wants and answer to nobody. His caddie, Doc Docherty of 
Vancouver, takes care of tournament commitments. 
</P>
<P>
	Franco takes care of the money.  
</P>
<P>
	He had a Japanese manager, who helped him sign his deal with  
Callaway Golf. But even with the potential to blossom into a star, 
Franco would rather go it alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have to take a cut,'' he said. ``I don't want to do  
that. I have one contract written in English and one in Spanish, so 
it's no problem. What's important is the money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For a guy who grew up barefooted in a shack in Paraguay, Franco  
is doing quite nicely in his first year on the tour. He got 
$468,000 for winning the Compaq Classic in New Orleans, moving him 
up to 12th on the money list with $814,520. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of that money will go toward his new house at Doral Resort  
in Miami, which is only an eight-hour flight from Paraguay. 
</P>
<P>
	``They speak Spanish there,'' Franco said. ``And my wife doesn't  
speak English.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The best perk for winning on tour was a limousine ride to the  
Hilton that tournament officials in New Orleans lined up. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was my first time in a limo,'' he said. ``We had  
champagne, but no women. Just five Colombians, a Puerto Rican and a 
Mexican.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Next up for Franco is trying to get into the U.S. Open without  
having to go through the final stage of qualifying at Colonial 
Country Club in Memphis, Tenn. Franco could gain an exemption by 
either winning another tournament or moving into the top 10 on the 
money list by the end of the Kemper Open. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *WHOA, NELLIE:* With Tiger Woods, Ernie Els and several top  
players taking appearance money to play the Deutsche Bank Open in 
Germany next week, the Colonial Invitational was believed to have 
the weaker of the two fields during the swing through the 
Dallas-Fort Worth area. 
</P>
<P>
	That may not be the case any longer.  
</P>
<P>
	Els and Vijay Singh decided not to play the Nelson Classic, and  
David Duval also decided last month that he would take the week off 
and play Colonial instead. On Monday, Payne Stewart backed out 
because he felt he needed a break, and Ben Crenshaw withdrew when 
his father died. 
</P>
<P>
	That leaves only Woods among the top seven on the money list  
playing in Dallas. A year ago, the Nelson had seven of the top 10 
money-leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, Woods remains the biggest draw on tour, and the Nelson  
is a sellout for the third consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BEER BLAST:* Kelly Gibson of New Orleans was so distraught over  
the 9 he made on No. 15 at English Turn in the third round of the 
Compaq Classic that he decided to make it up to the friends who 
were following him. 
</P>
<P>
	Gibson promised to buy them a beer on Sunday for every birdie he  
made. He wound up with four birdies in the final round, and his 
three brothers bought 18 beers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I played early, so it was probably too soon for a lot of  
people to drink beer,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The beer cost Gibson about $63, but the 15th hole turned out to  
be even more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
	Gibson made a quadruple bogey and a bogey on the par-5 in the  
last two rounds. Had he made par on the hole both days, he would 
have finished in a tie for 12th instead of 51st. 
</P>
<P>
	The difference? About $40,000.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SHELL SCHEDULE:* In what could be a preview for next year on  
the senior tour, Tom Watson will play Hale Irwin in the last of 
five matches on Shell's Wonderful World of Golf. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1999 series will begin in South Africa with Nick Price  
playing Ernie Els at Leopard Creek. Two of the straightest hitters 
in the game, Jim Furyk and Colin Montgomerie, will play the Paris 
Golf Club in France. 
</P>
<P>
	Shell also is including the women. Karrie Webb, already a  
four-time winner this year on the LPGA Tour, is scheduled to play 
Dinah Shore champion Dottie Pepper. The other match will feature 
Fred Couples against John Daly at Crosswater Golf Club in Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
	The matches, which will be shown at 8:30 p.m. on ESPN, start  
Sept. 21. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SENIOR STABLEFORD:* The Royal Caribbean Classic in Key  
Biscayne, Fla., will become the first Senior PGA Tour event to play 
under the Stableford scoring system. 
</P>
<P>
	The Royal Caribbean, the first full-field tournament on the  
Senior tour, joins the Sprint International in Castle Rock, Colo., 
as the only PGA-sanctioned events to use the Stableford. 
</P>
<P>
	Tournament director John Marovich said the change will ``set  
ourselves apart from the other Senior PGA Tour events.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Players earn two points for birdies, five points for eagles and  
eight points for double eagles. They lose one point for a bogey and 
three points for a double bogey or worse. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we asked the players their opinion, the response was  
overwhelming,'' he said. ``It will be a fun way for them to begin 
their season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Changes to the course to make sure the risk-reward opportunities  
exist include the 18th hole being changed from a par-4 to a par-5. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DIVOTS:* Steve Flesch has now finished second in his last three  
tournaments in Louisiana -- the last two PGA Tour events in New 
Orleans, and a Nike Tour stop in Lafayette. .... Chip Beck tied for 
31st in New Orleans, his best finish since the Buick Open in 1996. 
... Peter Dawson has been named to replace Michael Bonallack as 
secretary of the Royal &AMP; Ancient Golf Club. Dawson, a Scotsman, 
will join the R&AMP;A on June 1 and work with Bonallack until he 
officially steps down Sept. 14. ... Along with playing his first 
PGA Tour event as a professional, 19-year-old Sergio Garcia is 
studying for his driver's license exam. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------

<P>
	 *STAT OF THE WEEK:* Carlos Franco became the fifth player from  
the International team in the Presidents Cup to win on the PGA Tour 
this year. The others are Ernie Els (Nissan) Steve Elkington 
(Doral), Vijay Singh (Honda), Ernie Els (Los Angeles) and Stuart 
Appleby (Houston).

<HEADLINE>  Hasek Is Key to Sabres Hopes / Hockey Game Story  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- The Buffalo Sabres and Boston Bruins are  
talking about hitting in their best-of-7 Eastern Conference 
semifinal series. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's really about goaltending.  
</P>
<P>
	Boston's Byron Dafoe is tough. Buffalo's Dominik Hasek, the  
NHL's two-time defending MVP, is still the man to beat. 
</P>
<P>
	The quarreling rivals switch to Buffalo for Games 3 and 4  
Wednesday and Friday. No matter how much his Buffalo teammates and 
their Boston foes might quarrel on and off the ice, Hasek stays 
focused on one thing -- stopping the puck. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to get into a fight, but I want the referee to  
see that I'm really upset if somebody takes a cheap shot at me, 
especially after the whistle,'' Hasek said. ``I just make a couple 
steps and let my teammates do their job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres took good care of Hasek for most of Game 2, pestering  
the Boston forwards in much the same way Buffalo captain Michael 
Peca and forward Vaclav Varada had rendered Ottawa superstar Alexei 
Yashin scoreless in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Boston hasn't played their best game yet,'' Hasek  
said. ``They'll be sharp in the next game. If we want to win, we'll 
have to be sharp, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year Hasek overcame a nagging groin injury, a sagging  
Buffalo offense and a trade rumor that flew into town just in time 
for the second round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The 34-year-old goaltender had a career-best 1.87 goals-against  
average. He led the NHL for the sixth straight year in save 
percentage at .937 and is one playoff shutout away from a team 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	In the playoffs' first round, Hasek shut Ottawa down. He  
preserved a 2-0 lead late in the second period of Game 2 against 
Boston by turning back a flurry of shots during a Bruins' 5-on-3 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	Players on both teams talk about a big hit Sabres defenseman  
Alexei Zhitnik made on Bruins captain Ray Bourque in Buffalo's 3-1 
victory in Game 2. That led to more talk about possible 
repercussions against Hasek, Buffalo's equivalent of Bourque. 
</P>
<P>
	``There isn't a whole lot you can do about someone running over  
Dom,'' Sabres defenseman Jason Woolley said. ``If they're trying to 
pick a superstar to go after, he's the only one. We know where 
they're going if that's their game plan, but I don't think we're 
worried about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek worries a lot more about the puck than the talk. ``I don't  
think about becoming a target of Boston players,'' he said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's best goaltender also knows that while he's watching  
out for shots, someone is watching his back. 
</P>
<P>
	``My defense does a good job in front of me and they will take  
care of the players who take runs at me,'' Hasek said. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston will try to distract Hasek and aim high. In Game 1, Hasek  
allowed three goals on 21 shots after a lengthy layoff following 
Buffalo's sweep of favored Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course we have to be ready for traffic in front,'' said  
Hasek, whose unorthodox style has him flopping around, throwing 
down his stick and frequently skating out of the crease. 
</P>
<P>
	``I expect there will be a couple of times when I won't see the  
puck, but it doesn't mean I can't stop the puck,'' Hasek said. 
``They talk about creating traffic in front of me and shooting 
high; it doesn't change my style.''

<HEADLINE> FDA Explores Patient Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hoping to decrease the 100,000 patient deaths  
caused by medication side effects each year, the Food and Drug 
Administration is hunting new, safer ways to help patients use 
powerful drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Much depends on getting doctors, other health workers and  
patients themselves to help, FDA Commissioner Jane Henney said 
Monday in releasing a 150-page report on drug safety. 
</P>
<P>
	``Safe doesn't mean no risk,'' Henney stressed, explaining that  
both doctors and patients must understand that while every drug has 
side effects, there are ways to minimize risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Some side effects are largely unavoidable, like the fact that  
cancer chemotherapy can leave patients vulnerable to dangerous 
infections. 
</P>
<P>
	Others are a surprise. New drugs are tested on only a few  
hundred to a few thousand patients before they're sold to millions, 
meaning rare side effects that didn't show up in small clinical 
trials can wind up hurting hundreds of people. But doctors aren't 
required to report side effects to the FDA, which has only about 80 
employees to monitor the more than 3,000 prescription drugs sold. 
The agency has had to ban five drugs since September 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, experts say most side effect-caused deaths are  
preventable. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors may prescribe the wrong drugs -- sometimes confusing  
those with similar names -- or wrong dosages. The medicine may 
interact dangerously with another drug the patient takes but forgot 
to mention. A doctor may not monitor how a patient's liver or 
kidneys process a drug closely enough to avert potential problems, 
or patients may never be told to report early symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
	Busy physicians often don't fully read FDA-approved prescription  
labels to learn all the side effects, and it's hard to remember 
warnings for so many drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	So Henney announced plans Monday to improve patient safety. Part  
of the job is the FDA's. Plans include: 
</P>
<P>
	--Seeking $15.3 million from Congress this year to improve drug  
monitoring, including an upgraded computer network to speed reports 
of side effects. 
</P>
<P>
	--Designing a new drug label to help doctors find safety  
information quickly instead of having to fumble through pages of 
fine print. 
</P>
<P>
	--Exploring how to limit early sales of certain drugs, so that  
fewer people risk unexpected side effects. 
</P>
<P>
	--Considering expanding a pilot ``sentinel hospital'' project.  
FDA recently trained people in certain hospitals to investigate and 
report injuries caused by medical devices. Such programs could give 
early warning of flaws in treatments, or highlight those that 
require more doctor training. 
</P>
<P>
	Ensuring that doctors and patients use drugs in the safest  
manner possible after the FDA approves them is another matter. 
Henney said she would meet with doctors' and patients' groups this 
fall to discuss additional safety steps. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA's plans fail to acknowledge the agency's shortcomings,  
said Dr. Sidney Wolfe of the consumer advocacy group Public 
Citizen. He contends the agency has had to ban too many drugs after 
ignoring danger signals. 
</P>
<P>
	Henney's internal FDA report argued that the percentage of drugs  
banned has not increased even though the agency is approving dozens 
more medicines in recent years than it once did. 
</P>
<P>
	But Wolfe says the FDA sometimes approves drugs that work no  
better than older competitors but wind up being more dangerous. He 
cited the recently banned Posicor, which when approved was the 58th 
blood pressure drug sold. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the FDA didn't require liver testing for patients taking  
the new diabetes drug Rezulin until after some patients were 
injured, even though studies signaled that liver toxicity might 
arise, he said. At least 28 Rezulin patients have died. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors already are moving to improve patient safety,  
particularly with computer programs that automatically flag 
medication errors, American Medical Association president Dr. Nancy 
Dickey said. And the AMA's new National Patient Safety Foundation 
is conducting its own study of drug safety, including whether the 
FDA's process needs improvement.

<HEADLINE> British Premier League Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEEDS, England (AP) -- Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink scored on a diving  
header with four minutes left Tuesday night to give Leeds a 1-0 
upset win over Arsenal, knocking the Gunners out of first place in 
the Premier League with one game remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	Arsenal (21-4-12), which hadn't lost in the league since Dec.  
13, and Manchester United (21-3-12) each have 75 points. Manchester 
United is ahead of the defending champions on goal difference: 
plus-42 to plus-41. 
</P>
<P>
	Manchester United plays at Blackburn on Wednesday and finishes  
at home Sunday against Derby. Arsenal plays at home Sunday against 
Aston Villa in its final game. 
</P>
<P>
	Leeds looked set to take a 1-0 lead with a minute left in the  
first half, but Ian Harte missed a penalty kick after Arsenal's 
Martin Keown fouled Alan Smith. Harte hit the underside of the 
crossbar, and goalkeeper David Seaman made a tough save on the 
rebound shot from Hasselbaink.

<P>
	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- Diego Maradona's suspended jail  
sentence for a 1994 incident in which he attacked reporters with an 
air rifle has been reduced by 10 months to 2 years, according to 
news reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Maradona had no immediate comment on the decision by the court  
in Mercedes, 120 miles southwest of Buenos Aires. He can appeal 
that ruling to the province's supreme court. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for the reporters, Marcelo Bermolen, said he was  
pleased with the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Maradona was accused of using the air rifle to attack reporters  
and photographers outside his country home in 1994. His lawyers 
said he didn't fire the rifle, an argument rejected by prosecutors.

<HEADLINE> Journalists' Remains Arrive in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- The remains of three Chinese killed in NATO's  
bombing of China's embassy in Yugoslavia were returned to Beijing 
early Wednesday, hours after protests ebbed and state television 
for the first time aired U.S. and NATO apologies for the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Hu Jintao greeted the relatives of those killed  
as they stepped on to the Beijing airport tarmac carrying urns and 
photographs. The more than 20 diplomats and embassy staff members 
wounded in the bombing also arrived and ambulances quickly whisked 
them to at least three separate hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	The government bused in 1,000 school children, soldiers, factory  
and office workers and other officials and distributed flowers and 
flags to greet the plane from the Yugoslav capital, Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	Flags on government buildings and in Beijing's central Tiananmen  
Square were lowered to half-staff, as were the American flags at 
the U.S. Embassy and consulates. 
</P>
<P>
	A planned live television broadcast of the arrival had been  
expected to heighten emotions over the bombing. But streets were 
quiet outside the U.S. Embassy where angry protesters rallied over 
the past four days. 
</P>
<P>
	Police checked identity papers and turned people away from the  
entrance to the officially sanctioned protest route snaking past 
the U.S. and British embassies. 
</P>
<P>
	In a telephone interview Tuesday from the paint-spattered  
embassy where he remained holed up for a fourth day, U.S. 
Ambassador James Sasser said, ``Tomorrow is a critical day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Protesters hurled bits of concrete and shouted anti-American  
slogans as they passed by the battered embassy Tuesday, but their 
numbers were in the hundreds, not the thousands who menacingly 
streamed by the previous three days. Police controlled access to 
the marked-off, seven-block protest route, turning some away and 
asking others to discard the projectiles they carried. 
</P>
<P>
	After nightfall, police closed the protest route. Frustrated  
Chinese pushed against the police line but dispersed after a 
scuffle and the apparent arrest of one demonstrator. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Sasser called the new controls ``an enormous  
improvement,'' he was staying put. Violence persisted and police 
had refused to allow back into the embassy staff members who left, 
he said. ``So you run the risk once you leave of not being able to 
get back in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Angered by Friday's bombing of a symbolic piece of China's  
territory, Chinese have protested in 20 cities nationwide in the 
largest demonstrations since the Communist Party used the military 
to crush the Tiananmen Square democracy movement 10 years ago. 
Protesters have thrown gas and stink bombs at the U.S. Embassy and 
set fire to the U.S. consul's residence in Chengdu. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese leaders have refused to condemn the violence, abetted by  
party-run organizations and slanted coverage in the exclusively 
state-controlled media. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first direct comments on the protests, President Jiang  
Zemin called NATO's bombing ``a provocation to 1.2 billion Chinese 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Chinese people have used protests, meetings, statements  
and all sorts of methods to express their utmost indignation. It 
shows the fervor, will and strength of the great patriotic spirit 
of the Chinese people,'' state media quoted Jiang as telling 
Russian envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin, who was in the Chinese capital 
for talks on the Kosovo crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao repeated assurances that  
embassies and diplomatic personnel would be protected. He called 
the protests lawful and did not condemn outright the rock-throwing 
or arson. 
</P>
<P>
	``If those overreactions were seen to be supported by the  
Chinese government, that is a misunderstanding,'' Zhu said, without 
being more specific. 
</P>
<P>
	State media carried reports of President Clinton's Monday  
apology and reported that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright 
went to the Chinese Embassy in Washington on Saturday to apologize 
and promise a full accounting. TV news carried footage of Clinton 
saying he had apologized to Jiang, and NATO Secretary-General 
Javier Solana was shown expressing his regrets. 
</P>
<P>
	The absence of reports on the apologies had helped inflame  
protesters, who called the attack intentional. Tuesday's coverage 
did not mitigate official outrage. The official Xinhua News Agency 
reported late Tuesday that the words of regret ``were not the open 
and just apology demanded by the Chinese government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While noting the apology, Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu said  
China was waiting for more and reiterated demands for a complete 
investigation and criminal punishment of those responsible. He 
dismissed NATO explanations that the bombing resulted from 
misinformation by CIA target planners. 
</P>
<P>
	``How could the joint intelligence source of the most powerful  
military alliance in the world mistakenly identify the location of 
a large diplomatic mission with a big courtyard, a plate on the 
front door and flying the national flag?'' Zhu told reporters at a 
routine briefing. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials continued Tuesday to express deep  
regrets over the bombing, but the apologies were mixed with concern 
over rising anti-American sentiment and demonstrations in China. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, Secretary of Defense William Cohen suggested  
Beijing was overreacting and not giving the Chinese people an 
accurate enough account of what had actually taken place. 
</P>
<P>
	It ``defies all logic'' for anyone to suggest the attack was  
deliberate, Cohen told a Senate committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Jiang met with Chernomyrdin, the Russian envoy, who is trying to  
persuade China not to block a U.N. Security Council resolution that 
Russia and the seven major industrialized powers agreed to last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Chernomyrdin told reporters that he and Jiang had agreed  
the bombing in Yugoslavia must stop before peace talks can be held. 
But he also said it was necessary to go ahead with the G-8 plan to 
withdraw Yugoslav forces from Kosovo and deploy an international 
security force. 
</P>
<P>
	On the heels of suspending military, arms control and human  
rights contacts with the United States, China canceled a planned 
visit next week by Gen. Charles Krulak, commandant of the Marine 
Corps, U.S. defense officials said. They added that Cohen's planned 
trip to China in June now appears unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
	Ambassador Sasser said ``one of the great tragedies'' of the  
embassy bombing was the harm it did to U.S.-China relations so soon 
after Premier Zhu Rongji's visit to the United States last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Sasser hoped that ``once everyone has vented their feeling of  
anger and frustration that wiser heads will prevail and we'll move 
back in the direction of trying to establish a productive and 
stable relationship between our two countries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials continued to express deep regrets over  
the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, but the apologies 
were mixed with concern over rising anti-American sentiment and 
demonstrations in China. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen, in his Senate testimony, suggested Beijing was  
overreacting and not giving the Chinese people an accurate enough 
account of what had actually taken place. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it ``defies all logic'' for anyone to suggest the attack  
was deliberate.

<HEADLINE> Cannes Without U.S. Blockbusters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANNES, France (AP) -- There should be plenty of stars ambling  
along the famed boardwalk at Cannes this year. But a few others 
will be sorely missed. 
</P>
<P>
	Namely: Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker, Tom Cruise and Nicole  
Kidman. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the long-awaited new ``Star Wars'' movie nor ``Eyes Wide  
Shut,'' Stanley Kubrick's final film, will be on the bill when the 
52nd annual Film Festival kicks into gear on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Not for lack of trying. Festival head Gilles Jacob asked for  
both films, but was turned down -- a victim, he says, of Hollywood's 
desire to save its splashy openings for U.S. shores. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacob especially wanted ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' a tale of jealousy  
and sexual obsession starring real-life couple Cruise and Kidman, 
and he asked Kubrick about it before the director died in March. 
But the movie will open in the United States, on July 16. 
</P>
<P>
	As for ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' -- clearly  
the film event of the season, Cannes notwithstanding -- ``the 
producers feared it might make them lose viewers in the United 
States,'' Jacob told a French film magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't understand this attitude,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The film opens May 19, and you can bet the world of cinema will  
not be focusing on Cannes that day. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the four American entries in the main competition, only one,  
John Sayles' ``Limbo,'' is described as a big studio film. The love 
story set in Alaska stars David Straithairn and Mary Elizabeth 
Mastrantonio. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other films generating buzz:  
</P>
<P>
	--''The Cradle Will Rock'': Tim Robbins' film is about a  
left-wing theater company trying to stage an anti-capitalist play 
in 1937. It stars Susan Sarandon, John and Joan Cusack, John 
Turturro and Vanessa Redgrave. 
</P>
<P>
	--''Felicia's Journey'': Canadian Atom Egoyan, who directed the  
highly acclaimed ``The Sweet Hereafter,'' is back with a film about 
a 17-year-old girl's search for her real father. Bob Hoskins stars. 
</P>
<P>
	--''All About My Mother'': The always-interesting Spanish  
director Pedro Almodovar presents an offbeat tale about motherhood. 
</P>
<P>
	--''No One Writes to the Colonel'': Mexican Arturo Ripstein's  
film is based on a Gabriel Garcia Marquez novel about an 
impoverished colonel awaiting his pension. 
</P>
<P>
	-- ``The Emperor and the Assassin'': Chinese director Chen Kaige,  
of ``Farewell My Concubine'' fame, goes back to the year 300 B.C. 
to recount the birth of his country. Starring the famed Chinese 
actress Gong Li. 
</P>
<P>
	Also featured will be Israel's first entry in 25 years, and, out  
of competition, the first film from the tiny country of Bhutan. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the official selection lacks big-budget Hollywood  
productions, such fare will be available out of competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Howard's ``EDtv,'' not a big success in the United States,  
will be screened -- no doubt an effort to draw some needed overseas 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
	Films like ``EDtv'' have nothing to lose, because they already  
have opened back home. ``Primary Colors'' made a trip to Cannes for 
the same reasons last year. 
</P>
<P>
	But the producers of big-budget Hollywood films may have learned  
a sobering lesson about unveiling their movies at Cannes. Last 
year, parts of ``Armageddon'' were shown here to the foreign press, 
drawing derisive laughter -- clearly not what the filmmakers were 
aiming for.

<HEADLINE> Rose, Reds Incident To Be Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Pete Rose's claim that he spoke to Cincinnati  
Reds minor leaguers in Rockford, Ill., is a fabrication, the farm 
team's general manager said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's banned hits leader gave autographs on a concourse at  
the ballpark in Rockford as part of a promotion before a game but 
had no access to the players, general manager Bruce Keiter said. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for commissioner Bud Selig said baseball was  
investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first we heard about this was last night,'' Rich Levin  
said in New York. ``People here are looking into it and we'll see 
what happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Keiter said he made sure that the guidelines for Rose's lifetime  
ban for gambling were followed during the April 29 visit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pete's a good guy. I really think he is feeling years later  
the brunt of this whole thing taking effect on him,'' Keiter said 
in a telephone interview. ``He desperately wants to get back into 
organized baseball. This is not the way to go about it. 
</P>
<P>
	``He cannot fabricate things and make it appear he's doing  
things that he's actually not doing. When he continues to fabricate 
these things, it only puts him in a dimmer light with the 
powers-that-be in major league baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rose's ban essentially prohibits him from doing anything more  
than a regular ticket-buying fan at any game involving a major 
league team or one of its farm clubs affiliated with the National 
Association of Professional Baseball Leagues, the governing body of 
the minors. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose is allowed to be a special instructor for the Sacramento  
Steelheads because they're part of the independent Western League. 
He gave the players a motivational speech on Monday and said he'd 
recently talked to the Rockford Reds as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose said through his agent Tuesday night that he had only brief  
contact with some of the Rockford players between signing 
autographs for fans and throwing out a ceremonial first pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	``I spoke to Pete. The whole issue is going to be  
interpretation,'' agent Warren Greene said. ``In between signing 
and throwing out the first pitch, Pete was with some of the people 
from the promotion and a few of the players came over to shake 
Pete's hand and ask for an autograph. He did not speak to the 
players in any organized fashion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds have been reprimanded twice by major league baseball  
for allowing Rose to have unauthorized access or contact with 
players since he agreed to his ban in August 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, Rose improperly was allowed to go into the broadcast  
booths during a game at Riverfront Stadium. The Reds didn't know 
that was prohibited under his ban. 
</P>
<P>
	In spring training last year, Rose showed up in Sarasota, Fla.,  
to watch his son, Pete Jr., work out with Reds' minor leaguers. The 
Reds' minor leaguer coordinator invited Rose to talk to the 
players, another violation of the ban. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds admitted their mistake and were reprimanded but not  
fined. 
</P>
<P>
	When they learned of the planned appearance in Rockford, the  
Reds made sure everyone in the organization knew what Rose was 
prohibited from doing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't there, so I don't know what transpired, but I know  
the message was conveyed and I feel confident that there's nothing 
that they did to violate the rules,'' managing executive John Allen 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Keiter said Reds Hall of Famer Johnny Bench was supposed to  
appear at Marinelli Field for Rockford's opener on April 8, but the 
game was rained out. 
</P>
<P>
	Corporate sponsors helped bring Rose for the April 29 game and  
bought him a ticket. Rose signed autographs for about an hour on a 
concourse, then threw out a ceremonial first pitch along with other 
ticket holders before leaving. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just so nothing (improper) would take place, I had him sign  
balls in my office for each player,'' Keiter said. ``I put each 
ball in the player's locker the day after Pete was gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Keiter said Rose's visit was well received, drawing 3,083 fans  
to the 4,200-seat stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't fabricate. You've got to tell it like it is,''  
Keiter said. ``But I must tell you, he was a great guy around the 
people in the ballpark.''

<HEADLINE> Lakers' West Hints at Leaving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Jerry West says his days with the Los  
Angeles Lakers are numbered. How numbered, he's not sure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to be 61 years old (later this month),'' West said  
Tuesday in a rare interview session. ``To say you can do these jobs 
forever, I would be less than honest with you if I said I could.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since joining the Lakers as a player in 1960, West has spent  
every year but two employed by the team. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been in charge of the team's basketball operations for 17  
years -- the longest tenure in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Just last September, West signed a four-year contract extension  
that runs through the 2002-2003 season and reportedly is worth $3.5 
million annually. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I signed that contract, I had every intention of  
finishing it,'' he said. ``At times, these kind of jobs are really 
wearing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	West said he will meet with Lakers owner Jerry Buss at the end  
of the season, ``and talk about what's best for the Lakers and 
what's best for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	West, who had an outstanding 14-year career as a player and  
later coached the Lakers for three years, admitted last spring he 
was stressed out and was uncertain he would remain with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	However, then came some time off and, later on, the signing of  
the contract extension. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been an incredible love for me. To even think about  
walking away from it, that's very painful,'' West said. ``I have 
made some promises to Shaquille O'Neal. He's like family to me. the 
most important thing is to have enthusiasm for this job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal, who signed a six-year contract with the Lakers in 1996  
and is finishing his third season with the team, could exercise a 
clause allowing him to become a free agent this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him I'd be here,'' West said. ``He made a commitment to  
us. I really want to see us win a championship with him here. I 
really believe he's going to retire as an L.A. player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal said Monday there was ``a 97 percent chance I'll be back  
here next year. But I'm not even thinking about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When asked about recent speculation that he might take a  
front-office job with the New York Knicks, West smiled and said, 
``Fellas, I'm not going anywhere. I'm going to live in Los Angeles. 
I'm not looking for another job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As he did last year, West said his relationship with Buss was  
solid even though the two disagreed at times. 
</P>
<P>
	``This guy's been so great to me,'' West said. ``I can't tell  
you how great he's been. When I read about a deteriorating 
relationship, that really bothers me. He's really been a committed 
owner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the disagreements between West and Buss came over the  
signing of Dennis Rodman, who joined the Lakers in late February 
and was waived seven weeks later after several incidents. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really like Dennis,'' West said. ``There's nothing wrong  
with Dennis, he's a nice guy. I didn't think he was a good fit. It 
put a terrible burden on Kurt Rambis as a coach. I didn't think it 
was a good fit for (Rodman).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rambis was hired to succeed Del Harris on the same day Rodman  
played in his first game for the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I pretty much say to Jerry what I think,'' West said of the  
owner. ``It is his team. He wants to win a championship. He thought 
it would bring us a step closer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As far as Rambis is concerned, West said, ``He's done a terrific  
job. I wrote him a note the other day, `You've finally arrived as 
an NBA coach.' ''

<HEADLINE> Ark. Boat Apparently Missing Alarm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOT SPRINGS, Ark. (AP) -- The owner of a tour boat that sank  
earlier this month, killing 13 people, had apparently not followed 
a Coast Guard order to install an alarm that warns when a vessel is 
taking on water, the owner's lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors said the Miss Majestic took on water quickly May 1 and  
sank in less than a minute. The operator of the boat has told 
investigators that she did not believe the bilge pump activated and 
that she had no warning before the vessel went down in about 60 
feet of water. 
</P>
<P>
	At a Coast Guard investigative hearing Tuesday, a Coast  
Guardsman who inspected the amphibious tour boat about two months 
before it sank in Lake Hamilton said he declared the vessel fit 
despite a number of problems he found. 
</P>
<P>
	Among nine items that Chief Warrant Officer Troy Collins wanted  
dealt with were installation of an alarm to indicate the boat was 
taking on water. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even with these items here, I still considered the vessel  
fit,'' Collins said of his Feb. 23 inspection. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Robert Bowen, supervisor for marine inspections at the Coast  
Guard station in Memphis, Tenn., told the investigation board 
Monday that the boat's approval came with the condition that the 
bilge alarm and a device for detecting flammable vapors be 
installed, in accordance with new Coast Guard regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	The boat's owner had until March 11 to install the equipment,  
but Bowen could not say whether the Coast Guard checked to see that 
the deadline was met. 
</P>
<P>
	Q. Byrum Hurst Jr., a lawyer for boat owner Don Bridges, said  
that the vapor detection device may have been installed but that he 
did not believe the vessel had a bilge alarm when it went down. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins testified that he had not inspected a duck boat -- which  
operates on land and in water -- in five years when he inspected 
four such craft belonging to Land and Lake Tours Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked to look over several photographs of the boat after it was  
raised from the bottom fo the lake, Collins pointed out several 
possible violations of Coast Guard regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	One was the attachment of a life preserver to the boat with what  
appeared to be a bicycle chain. He also said four child's life 
preservers appeared to be obstructed and may not have been easily 
accessible in an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
	Under questioning, Collins said he would not have certified the  
boat as seaworthy had he seen a life preserver secured by a chain. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard panel's esponsibility is to determine what  
caused the accident and make recommendations on preventing such 
tragedies. The hearing is expected to take a week.

<HEADLINE> FBI Sets Up Internet Fraud Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) -- It's hard to fight Internet crime  
when you don't even have a solid idea about how much commerce there 
is -- or how much fraud actually occurs. 
</P>
<P>
	Law enforcement officials will be getting some needed  
assistance. The FBI and several anti-fraud groups announced Monday 
they are establishing an Internet Fraud Complaint Center and 
forming the Internet Fraud Council. 
</P>
<P>
	The center and the council will be modeled after the  
Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control, which collects health 
data and tracks health trends. 
</P>
<P>
	``The goal is to give law enforcement significant support in  
investigating these cases,'' said Richard Johnston, director of the 
National White Collar Crime Center, which is joining the FBI in 
developing the center in a private-public partnership. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet crime-fighting effort was announced at the Economic  
Crime Summit conference at Walt Disney World. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet crimes range from credit card fraud to pyramid scams to  
securities fraud. Authorities said they have no idea how much 
Internet commerce takes place -- estimates range from $9 billion to 
$108 billion -- and even less of a clue how much Internet fraud 
occurs. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the mission of the Internet Fraud Council will be to  
give law enforcement a picture of how big Internet crime really is. 
The council, supported by the National Fraud Center, the National 
Coalition for the Prevention of Economic Crime and the National 
White Collar Crime Center, will also provide training against 
Internet fraud and create forecasts of fraudulent activity. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Fraud Center is a Horsham, Pa.-based fraud and risk  
management consulting firm. The National White Collar Crime Center 
is a federally funded research and consulting firm based in 
Richmond, Va. The privately financed National Coalition for the 
Prevention of Economic Crime is a research organization that aims 
to educate the private sector about economic fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint center will take information on its Web site from  
Internet crime victims. The center plans to link its Web site with 
law enforcement sites around the nation so victims can make 
reports. Those reports will allow the FBI to analyze trends and 
notify local law enforcement if action is needed. 
</P>
<P>
	An address for the Web site has yet to be determined. The center  
is scheduled to open in late summer in a yet-to-be-selected 
location in West Virginia and will eventually employ 135 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The popularity of the Internet has changed the face of crime,  
authorities said at the conference. Internet criminals are 
increasingly well-educated and female. 
</P>
<P>
	And they are no longer constrained by borders and boundaries.  
They are as likely to commit crimes over the Internet from Bozeman, 
Mont., as from Manama, Bahrain. 
</P>
<P>
	Because cyber-criminals can move about easily, it is even more  
crucial that law enforcement share information with each other, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cyber-criminals don't have the financial limits of law  
enforcement and many upgrade their computer equipment and software 
every six months, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Criminals aren't saddled with taking the lowest bid when  
buying equipment,'' said Florida Department of Law Enforcement 
Commissioner Tim Moore. ``They don't have a lot of albatrosses 
around their neck.''

<HEADLINE> Heroin Blamed in Mark Tuinei Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PLANO, Texas (AP) -- Former Dallas Cowboys offensive lineman Mark  
Tuinei died of an accidental drug overdose after taking a 
combination of heroin and a stimulant, according to a report 
Tuesday from the Collin County medical examiner. 
</P>
<P>
	Plano police chief Bruce Glasscock said his department's  
investigation indicated Tuinei had never before used heroin, 
although he didn't detail how that determination was made. 
</P>
<P>
	``What you had was a 39-year-old male, 6-(foot)-5, in excess of  
300 pounds, a healthy individual, took one shot of heroin and 
basically dropped dead as a result,'' Glasscock said during a press 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuinei died Thursday morning. According to a police affidavit,  
Cowboys running back Nicky Sualua said Tuinei bought a small amount 
of heroin the previous evening and passed out after taking the drug 
at a North Dallas apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tuinei lost consciousness almost immediately and stopped  
breathing,'' Glasscock said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sualua told police he revived Tuinei and drove to Tuinei's home,  
where both men fell asleep in the car. Sualua said when he woke up 
the next morning, Tuinei was not breathing and had no pulse. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuinei's wife, Pono, who was in Hawaii at the time of her  
husband's death, said his heroin use ``came as a complete shock to 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My heart is filled with sadness, confusion and disbelief,''  
she said in a statement issued Tuesday afternoon by her lawyer in 
Dallas. ``If Mark could speak to us now, his wish would be that 
lessons be learned from his death so that similar unnecessary 
tragedies could be prevented in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glasscock said there have been no arrests in connection with  
Tuinei's death, adding that the arrests of three people outside the 
apartment where Sualua said Tuinei took the heroin were unrelated 
to the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The police chief declined to say whether Sualua was in legal  
jeopardy, saying the case would be turned over a North Texas task 
force of the U.S. Attorney's office. He said Texas law has no 
provisions to prosecute Sualua for failing to seek immediate 
medical assistance for Tuinei. 
</P>
<P>
	The affidavit that described Tuinei's last night was filed so  
police could convince a Collin County judge to issue a warrant for 
officers to search the ex-player's Plano home. Glasscock said 
police found a marijuana pipe, a marijuana cigarette and a tablet 
that appeared to be Ecstasy, a mood-enhancing stimulant. 
</P>
<P>
	Glasscock said the police investigation determined that Tuinei  
had been using Ecstasy heavily for the last two weeks. The 
coroner's report found traces of methylenedioxyamphetamine, similar 
to Ecstasy, in his bloodstreatm. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. William Rohr, Collin County's medical examiner, said either  
the heroin or the ecstacy could have killed the former player. 
</P>
<P>
	Glasscock said the investigation did not indicate that any other  
members of the Cowboys were with Tuinei his last night. He also 
said Sualua, to his knowledge, was never tested for drugs, although 
police spent several hours with him after Tuinei died. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Cowboys headquarters in Irving, spokesman Rich Dalrymple  
said on Thursday morning that the Cowboys would make no changes in 
Sualua's status unless the police take official action against him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is on our active roster,'' he said of the two-year veteran  
from Ohio State, a 5-foot-11, 257-pound fullback. 
</P>
<P>
	Team owner Jerry Jones released a statement Tuesday that did not  
address Sualua's status. 
</P>
<P>
	``As an organization, we understand the impact of this  
tragedy,'' Jones said. ``That is why we must continue to educate 
our players as to the dangers of substance abuse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear how the news of Tuinei's cause of death would  
affect his former teammates. Tuinei spent 15 years with the 
Cowboys, playing on three Super Bowl championship teams and earning 
two trips to the Pro Bowl as a 320-pound left tackle. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's totally a shock to me,'' former safety and current  
assistant coach Bill Bates said about Tuinei's heroin use, ``and 
it's something that is not going to take away from the love I had 
for him and the times that we had together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Cowboys defensive back Everson Walls said the heroin  
involvement by a player who had been perceived as clean-cut during 
his playing days is another black mark for a team that has endured 
several drug-related suspensions in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the Cowboys just really have to learn that throughout  
their organization they have always had problems,'' Walls said. 
``But at the same time, the Cowboys have done a lot of good things 
within the organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just another bad mark on the record.''  
</P>
<P>
	A funeral for Tuinei is scheduled for Thursday in Hawaii, where  
his wife returned after coming to Dallas for a memorial service on 
Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Louima Can't Identify Second Cop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A Haitian immigrant told a jury he can't  
positively identify one of two officers accused of torturing him in 
a police station bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
	But Abner Louima stuck by his story.  
</P>
<P>
	Asked to look at defendant Charles Schwarz on Monday at the  
police brutality trial, Louima said the officer resembled the 
officer who dragged him into the bathroom. But, he added, ``I'm not 
sure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schwarz's attorney, Stephen Worth, seized the chance to invoke  
Louima's admission that he had lied when he told investigators and 
the media that he heard one attacking officer say, ``It's Giuliani 
time,'' a reference to the aggressive policing policies of Mayor 
Rudolph Giuliani. 
</P>
<P>
	``Isn't it true, Mr. Louima, that your second man in that  
bathroom is another `Giuliani time,' another way that you want to 
raise the attention of the country on this case?'' Worth asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, sir,'' Louima responded.  
</P>
<P>
	The exchange was part of a relentless cross-examination of  
Louima by four defense lawyers Monday, his second day on the 
witness stand. He is to resume testifying Wednesday; today's 
testimony was canceled because a juror was ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwarz and three other officers are charged with taking turns  
beating Louima because they believed -- mistakenly -- he had punched 
one, Justin Volpe, in a melee outside a Brooklyn nightclub on Aug. 
9, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe and Schwarz are additionally charged with the bathroom  
attack that same night at Brooklyn's 70th Precinct station house. 
The other officers are Thomas Bruder and Thomas Wiese; a fifth 
officer, Michael Bellomo, is charged with covering up the assault. 
</P>
<P>
	Louima last week identified Volpe as the officer who allegedly  
rammed a broken broomstick into his rectum, causing severe internal 
injuries. The officer, he said, ``told me if I ever talk to anyone 
about what happened to me, he kill me and everybody in my family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case, which involves a black victim and five white officers,  
has strained relations between the police department and 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Volpe's attorney, Marvyn Kornberg, suggested Louima  
changed his story to support a lawsuit filed on his behalf by O.J. 
Simpson's former lawyers Johnnie Cochran Jr., Barry Scheck and 
Peter Neufeld. 
</P>
<P>
	``Has your memory gotten better since you retained Mr. Cochran,  
Mr. Scheck and Mr. Neufeld in a $155 million lawsuit?'' Kornberg 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, sir,'' Louima replied.  
</P>
<P>
	The attorney had confronted Louima with his 1997 statement to a  
state grand jury that no other officer was holding him down as 
Volpe sodomized him. Last week, Louima testified that a second 
officer, identified by authorities as Schwarz, restrained him by 
grabbing the chain of his handcuffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Louima, 32, also testified Volpe was the officer who hit him in  
the head with a police radio, contradicting grand jury testimony in 
which he couldn't identify the attacker. 
</P>
<P>
	Louima insisted his trial testimony was more accurate than past  
statements, many of which were made while he was still in the 
hospital and on medication. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now I am not really worried too much about my health,'' he  
said. ``I'm more peaceful. I have a better chance to think.''

<HEADLINE> AP Clarifies ACLU Complaints Story </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- An Associated Press story May 9 about  
complaints received by American Civil Liberties Union offices 
around the country gave an incomplete account of one ACLU 
official's position on school safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleanor Eisenberg, executive director of the ACLU in Arizona,  
was quoted in the story as saying: ``Schools are saying that school 
safety comes first and students' rights second. That's wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eisenberg said that when she made the statement she was  
paraphrasing the following quotation from Benjamin Franklin: ``They 
that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary 
safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said denying civil liberties was not a solution to the  
problem of alienation and violence by young people. But she did not 
mean to suggest that the safety of children was less important than 
student rights.

<HEADLINE>  Pilot Sentenced in Italy Ski Tragedy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A Marine pilot convicted of  
obstruction of justice for helping destroy a videotape of his fatal 
flight over the Italian Alps will spend six months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury of seven officers deliberated about two hours Monday  
before announcing the sentence for Capt. Richard Ashby, 32, of 
Mission Viejo, Calif. Twenty people died when his jet cut an 
Italian ski gondola cable. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby, who faced a maximum sentence of 10 years, is the only  
person charged in the February 1998 accident to serve prison time. 
He also will be dismissed from the Marines. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby stood at attention as the sentence was read by Col. Gerald  
Yanello, commander of New River Air Station. He was then led away 
to the brig by two officers from his air wing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were all surprised,'' said defense attorney Frank Spinner.  
``No one thought that confinement was a final option. We were 
appalled the government even asked for two years of confinement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spinner said he would appeal the case once a review is conducted  
by Lt. Gen. Peter Pace, commander of Marine Forces Atlantic. The 
review could take six months. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby had no comment as he walked to a white Jeep driven by a  
military policeman. Before Ashby was taken away, he cried and 
hugged his mother, stepfather and girlfriend, Spinner said. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, a separate jury acquitted Ashby of 20 counts of  
involuntary manslaughter for the deaths of the passengers aboard 
the Mount Cermis gondola cable. The verdict enraged relatives of 
the victims, as well as Italian leaders 
</P>
<P>
	The EA-6B Prowler's navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, 31, of  
Westbury, N.Y., pleaded guilty to obstructing justice and was 
sentenced to dismissal from the service but no prison time. 
</P>
<P>
	Once Ashby landed the crippled jet at the NATO air base at  
Aviano, Italy, he took out the videotape, which was made earlier in 
the flight and was intended as a souvenir. 
</P>
<P>
	He testified that he later gave it to Schweitzer at the  
navigator's request. Schweitzer said he later threw it into a 
bonfire because he was afraid his face was on the tape and could be 
used by Italian media. 
</P>
<P>
	While acknowledging that he helped get rid of the tape, Ashby  
denied he had a criminal intent -- impeding the investigation into 
the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Two back-seat officers in the jet were charged with involuntary  
manslaughter soon after the accident but the charges were 
dismissed. One of those officers, Capt. Chandler Seagraves, told 
investigators about the tape after he was granted immunity from 
prosecution.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Welfare Recipients Studied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Most Americans who have been swept from  
welfare rolls have jobs and earn more than they got from the 
government -- but not enough to escape poverty or even, sometimes, 
to keep the phone connected. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the picture painted by 21 state studies that, after much  
speculation, provide the first glimpse of what has happened to the 
millions who have left welfare amid tough new rules and 
unprecedented economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	While homelessness and other worst-case scenarios are rare, a  
substantial number of these families face hardships, such as 
trouble paying for food and utility bills, an Associated Press 
review of the studies shows. 
</P>
<P>
	In assessing the growing body of information, it's easy for  
analysts to focus on the data that supports their convictions, said 
Mark Greenberg of the liberal Center for Law and Social Policy. 
Work rates are up, yet so are daily struggles. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important to see those are both part of the story,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	America's welfare rolls have dropped further and faster than  
anyone predicted. Fueled by the strongest economy in a generation 
and strict new work requirements and time limits, the rolls have 
dropped from more than 5 million families in 1994 to just 2.7 
million by the end of last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Virtually every state has a study under way to see where these  
former recipients have landed. Some examine wage reports from 
employers to see who is working. Others use telephone surveys. Some 
go door-to-door. 
</P>
<P>
	The differences in methodology make it difficult to compare  
states. And critics warn that some surveys have low response rates, 
raising suspicions that those who are hardest to find may be having 
the most trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the current results offer a wealth of new information.  
</P>
<P>
	The most basic question is whether people are working, and the  
results range from 35 percent in Mississippi to 75 percent in 
Florida. Most states hover between 50 percent and 65 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The rates appear lower among those kicked off welfare because  
they wouldn't follow the rules. In New Jersey, just 29 percent of 
this group had jobs when surveyed; in Tennessee, it was about 40 
percent, and in Iowa, 53 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Even some liberal analysts find the data more positive than they  
expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a picture in my head of most former welfare recipients  
being destitute and left out in the cold, but I've had to rethink 
that opinion,'' said Sarah Brauner, a researcher with the Urban 
Institute, who has reviewed many studies. 
</P>
<P>
	But others argue the nation should expect more given the strong  
economy and the billions of dollars states can spend. Even those 
who work don't, in most cases, leave poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	In Florida, a state board decided that $10 an hour was needed  
for ``self-sufficiency,'' but just 4 percent to 8 percent of state 
residents leaving the welfare rolls were earning that much. 
</P>
<P>
	In most states, those working tend to earn just above minimum  
wage, with averages ranging from $5.50 to $7.50 per hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Maryland found wages rose as people had been off welfare  
longer, suggesting they were moving up the economic ladder. 
</P>
<P>
	But people who have left welfare share many problems:  
</P>
<P>
	--Substantial numbers say there was a time when they couldn't  
afford to buy food -- 43 percent in Florida and 32 percent in 
Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	--Many get behind paying utility bills -- 59 percent in Florida  
alone. 
</P>
<P>
	--In New Orleans, which conducted its own study, 22 percent have  
had their phones cut off. 
</P>
<P>
	--In Wisconsin, 68 percent say they are ``just barely making it  
from day to day.'' In South Carolina, 56 percent say that. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a tiny number report being homeless or having to give up  
children to foster care. 
</P>
<P>
	Many sound positive about their new lives. In Kentucky, more  
than half say they are better off since leaving welfare. In South 
Carolina, 59 percent say they have more money now. In Mississippi, 
60 percent say life was not better before. 
</P>
<P>
	In Iowa, 40 percent said their income went up after leaving  
welfare, while 49 percent said it went down. 
</P>
<P>
	So how are people supporting themselves, particularly those not  
working? 
</P>
<P>
	Most rely on friends and family. In Florida, 23 percent said  
they had moved in with someone else to help pay bills. In New 
Mexico and New Jersey, nearly half got help from family. 
</P>
<P>
	But some experts worry this support may not last. Patience may  
wear thin, generosity may run out, and many of these families and 
friends are poor, too. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, advocates and state officials alike worry that  
many people are not using -- and may not know about -- government 
supports. That includes Medicaid, food stamps and child care 
subsidies, all of which are available even after a family stops 
receiving cash welfare. 
</P>
<P>
	In Massachusetts, just 7 percent of families who left welfare  
get food stamps. In South Carolina, just 13 percent are getting 
child care subsidies. In Michigan, barely six in 10 get Medicaid. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether the early findings spell success depends largely on  
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The program is not going to convert the welfare poor into the  
middle class,'' cautions Jack Tweedie of the National Conference of 
State Legislatures. ``And we shouldn't look at it that way.''

<HEADLINE>  Pete Rose Back with Independent Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Pete Rose is banned from the major  
leagues and ineligible for the Hall of Fame. That means little to 
the Sacramento Steelheads, who look at the career hits leader as an 
inspiration and a publicity windfall. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose, who insists his stint as special instructor for the  
Western Baseball League team is not an effort to generate public 
support for his bid to overturn the ban, was back on a diamond 
Monday with a bat in his hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose, who will get paid about $50,000 to work with players  
averaging $1,250 a month, said he took the job because he loves to 
teach young players. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just to help Sacramento. This is not to help Pete  
Rose. This is fun,'' he said. ``I don't go to bed every night and 
pray I can go to the Hall of Fame. I can't live my life in the 
past. Life goes on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rose wore a black long-sleeved shirt, along with designer  
sunglasses and a Steelheads cap. In addition to working with the 
players and giving them a 75-minute inspirational speech Monday, 
Rose will be back May 28 to toss out the ceremonial first pitch at 
Sacramento's home opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose hit fungoes to Steelheads outfielders Monday, and then  
worked with the infielders on rundowns and other game situations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can still hit, I just can't run. I still have good  
hand-to-eye coordination,'' said Rose, who slammed liners and sharp 
grounders toward the aspiring major league outfielders. ``I'm 58 
years old -- I don't look it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rose, indeed, looks pretty good. He has gotten heavier and is  
slowed by aching knees. But he is tanned and fit, and retains the 
intense gaze and peripatetic style that were among his trademarks. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose, a 17-time All-Star and the NL MVP in 1973, agreed in  
August 1989 to accept a lifetime ban after commissioner A. Bartlett 
Giamatti concluded Rose bet on games involving the Cincinnati Reds 
while he was their manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose served five months at a federal prison after pleading  
guilty in April 1990 to two counts of filing false income tax 
returns by failing to report $354,968 in income from autograph 
appearances, memorabilia sales and gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	The career leader in hits with 4,256 and games with 3,562 is  
ineligible for the Hall of Fame as long as the ban is in effect. 
Rose applied for reinstatement in September 1997, but has not 
received a response from current commissioner Bud Selig. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the 14 people banned for life by baseball for gambling  
has been reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose is prohibited from going on the field or clubhouse of any  
major league team, or any minor league team in organized baseball. 
The Western Baseball League is independent and not covered by those 
rules. Monday's appearance was the first time Rose has actually 
worked with players since the ban. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose said he gave a speech to Reds minor leaguers last week in  
Rockford, Ill., and both Rose and his agent, Warren Greene, 
defended that appearance as allowable under the ban. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig's spokesman, Rich Levin, was unaware of the Rockford  
speech, but said if Rose spoke with Reds minor leaguers, it would 
appear to violate the ban. 
</P>
<P>
	Reds general manager Jim Bowden said one of the team's minor  
league officials was in Rockford when Rose visited and had been 
reminded of the terms of Rose's ban. Rockford general manager Bruce 
Keiter also was informed. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden was unaware of any speech Rose might have made to the  
minor leaguers. Keiter did not return a telephone message. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were no violations to our knowledge while he was  
there,'' Bowden said. 
</P>
<P>
	Steelheads players said they know about the ban, but appreciated  
hearing from Rose. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't idolize Pete Rose, but I respect his accomplishments.  
I loved watching him play,'' said pitcher Ryan Bowen, who played 
for the Houston Astros and Florida Marlins and is now trying to 
resurrect his career with the Steelheads. 
</P>
<P>
	Steelheads owner Bruce Portner said he went looking for a  
controversial figure to create a buzz around his expansion team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course it's for publicity. It helps keep Sacramento in the  
nation's eyes as a baseball town. Remember, there's been no 
professional baseball here for 25 years,'' Portner said. ``Let's 
face it, he's Pete Rose. He's banned but also a legend in 
baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rose was scheduled to give a 15-minute pep talk to the  
Steelheads, but ended up giving a 75-minute speech while standing 
near the pitcher's mound at Sacramento City College's Union 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's incredible to sit and listen to him,'' said catcher Tim  
McIntosh, a former major leaguer who went to spring training with 
the New York Yankees this year. ``He's an idol. He a god. You see a 
lot of guys coming through the clubhouse, but he's got 4,000 
hits.''

<HEADLINE> US May Ease Sanctions on Terrorists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Weeks after the Clinton administration said  
U.S. food and medical items could be sold to three terrorist 
nations, lawmakers are looking to further ease economic sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Agriculture Chairman Richard Lugar, R-Ind., said the  
amount of activity under way in Congress to further relax sanctions 
will likely ``lead to some degree of success.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Billions of dollars in sales and income have been lost.  
Thousands of jobs in our farm economy have been sacrificed,'' said 
Lugar, sponsor of a measure to exempt commercial farm exports from 
sanctions unless otherwise determined by the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``In some instances, the sanctioned countries represented major  
markets for U.S. agricultural products,'' Lugar said at a Senate 
hearing Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a decision praised by lawmakers in both parties, President  
Clinton last month eased sanctions on the sale of food and medical 
items to Iran, Libya and Sudan. 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said the United States was  
losing about $500 million in sales each year because of the 
sanctions -- about 1 percent of total U.S. exports. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a good first step,'' said Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo.  
``But I think Congress and the administration need to use their 
combined authority to lift further most of the remaining 
restrictions on our farmers and ranchers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Undersecretary of State Stuart E. Eizenstat said he sensed ``a  
change in attitude in Congress with respect to sanctions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Eizenstat said the administration wants to be careful to  
ensure that makers of industrial goods and other nonfarm products 
also benefit from any further relaxation of sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to consider that as well as the precise details before  
we can make a specific endorsement,'' Eizenstat said of pending 
legislative proposals.

	U.S. Says NATO Demands Must Be Met  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration says that without a  
full Yugoslav agreement to NATO's central demands, bombing will 
continue against its troops and their support structure even if 
President Slobodan Milosevic does as he announced and withdraws 
some of his forces from Kosovo. Entering the 49th day of Operation 
Allied Force today, the Western alliance is insisting that in 
addition to a complete troop withdrawal, Milosevic must agree to 
grant the Serbian province autonomy and allow displaced ethnic 
Albanians to return under the protection of an international 
military force. 

</P>
<P>
	Sasser: US-China Dispute an Aberrration  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ambassador James Sasser believes the flap over  
the mistaken U.S. bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade is an 
aberration that the two sides will overcome. Sasser said he is 
encouraged by signs of a Chinese willingness for the first time to 
permit the media to publish U.S. expressions of condolences over 
the loss of life in Belgrade and the apologies of President Clinton

	Death sentence for Gandhi Assassins  
</P>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- India's Supreme Court commuted the death  
sentences of 22 defendants today in the 1991 assassination of 
former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, but ordered that four others in 
the case must face capital punishment. Three of the defendants were 
given life sentences. Two people were acquitted, and 17 others were 
ordered released after receiving sentences less than the nearly 
eight years they have been held. A court in the southern city of 
Madras had sentenced all 26 to death in January 1998 after a trial 
that lasted six years.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Saying American businesses must invest in  
markets at home as they do abroad, President Clinton is appealing 
to the nation's chief executives to join the effort to breathe new 
life into cities and rural areas missing out on the current 
economic boom. The president was convening a meeting today at the 
White House with 15 business leaders to discuss ways to bolster 
private investment in economically distressed communities. 
Afterward, Clinton was traveling to Atlanta for more discussions 
with CEOs and a tour of the Sweet Auburn Market, located near the 
Martin Luther King Jr. historic district, to see an example of the 
type of economic development he hopes to generate in other areas.

	UN Council Still Far Apart on Iraq  
</P>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Despite weeks of negotiations and warnings  
that inaction will only make matters worse, the Security Council 
appears to have made little headway in forging an agreement on a 
new policy towards Iraq. Sporadic bombing of targets in Iraq has 
continued and Baghdad's goal of getting the council to lift the 
economic sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait is 
still a long way off. While some council members regularly express 
concern that Iraq's weapons programs are not being monitored -- and 
U.N. weapons inspectors are barred from returning to Baghdad -- 
major differences remain on how to resume oversight of Iraq's 
disarmament.

<HEADLINE> Dominion To Buy CNG for $6.4B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Spurning Columbia Energy Group,  
Consolidated Natural Gas Co. chose to accept Dominion Resources 
Inc.'s revised $6.4 billion acquisition offer, paving the way for 
the creation of the nation's fourth-largest electric and natural 
gas utility. 
</P>
<P>
	On April 18, Columbia Energy offered $6.68 billion in cash and  
stock for CNG. The offer came despite a ``definitive merger 
agreement'' announced in February between CNG and Richmond, 
Va.-based Dominion Resources. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are disappointed in the CNG board's decision,'' said Oliver  
G. Richard III, chairman, president and chief executive officer of 
Columbia Energy, adding that the Herndon, Va.-based company was 
withdrawing its offer for CNG. 
</P>
<P>
	The revised deal with Dominion Resources will give CNG  
shareholders a combination of cash and Dominion stock worth $66.60 
for each CNG share. The original deal had been an all-stock offer, 
but Dominion Resources sweetened the offer by guaranteeing its cash 
value. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia Energy had offered $70 a share for CNG stock -- $45.50  
in cash and $24.50 in stock. 
</P>
<P>
	CNG said Tuesday night that the new Dominion Resources offer was  
better ``due to its certainty and timing, the strategic benefits of 
a gas and electric combination, and the upside potential to 
shareholders of an investment in the combined CNG-Dominion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that a combination of CNG and Dominion best serves  
our shareholders because it makes strategic sense and has a 
straightforward road map to completion,'' said George A. Davidson 
Jr., chairman and CEO of CNG. ``Together we will have the scale, 
scope and skills to be successful in the competitive energy 
marketplace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This reaffirms and sustains our plans to create the nation's  
premier energy company,'' said Thos. E. Capps, chairman, president 
and CEO of Dominion Resources. ``Our amended offer -- an offer that 
was, and is, valued fairly -- protects and promotes the long-term 
interests of shareholders at both companies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia Energy is a major energy services company with roles in  
natural gas exploration and production, transmission, distribution 
and storage. Its 1998 revenues were nearly $6.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Dominion Resources, the parent company of electricity supplier  
Virginia Power, had $6 billion in revenues last year. 
</P>
<P>
	CNG, which had $2.8 billion in revenues last year, supplies  
natural gas to 1.9 million customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, 
Virginia and West Virginia and owns 7,600 miles of gas pipelines in 
New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Virginia, West Virginia and Maryland.

<HEADLINE> Horse Renamed After Colo. Shootings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- In a rare move, the owner of a 3-year-old  
filly named Columbine Is Sad was allowed to change the horse's name 
in deference to the shooting victims in Littleton, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	The horse, owned by John Ed Anthony of Arkansas's Shortleaf  
Stable, will now run under the name Dake. The Jockey Club in 
Lexington, which registers thoroughbred names, accepted the change 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony originally named Columbine Is Sad after a song of that  
name. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen people died in the shootings at Columbine High School on  
April 20, counting the two gunmen who committed suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Jockey Club registrar E.A. ``Buddy'' Bishop said Monday he knew  
of only three or four cases in the last decade in which a name had 
been changed once a horse had raced. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's strictly an integrity issue,'' he said. ``If people keep  
changing horse's names after workouts and races, it gets so after a 
while you can't keep up with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In this case, however, ``It was pretty obvious why it was the  
right thing to do,'' Bishop said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bishop said he got a call from Anthony shortly after the  
Colorado shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was even thinking of retiring the filly,'' Bishop said.  
``He figured every time he ran the filly, it would just bring it up 
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Running as Columbine Is Sad, Dake has finished in the money  
seven times in 12 lifetime starts and has won three times, earning 
$87,640.

<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- A day after a parade was held in his honor in  
Capac, Army Staff Sgt. Christopher Stone attended the Detroit Red 
Wings playoff game against the Colorado Avalanche on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone, wearing his Army uniform, was introduced to the crowd  
with 12:18 left in the first period. The crowd applauded as he 
waved from a luxury box and then held up a Red Wings shirt with the 
No. 1 and the name ``Stone'' on it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't say I feel like a hero. I just feel like I did my best  
and the homecoming I'm receiving is what everybody should get when 
they come home from something like that,'' Stone said during an 
interview on WKBD-TV during the second period. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone, bruised and battered during 32 days in captivity in  
Yugoslavia, said what kept him strong was: ``Faith in God, hope and 
a belief in my country and all the people I knew were supporting 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stone, who is from Smiths Creek in St. Clair County, was  
captured along with two soldiers under his command, Spc. Steven M. 
Gonzales, 22, and Staff Sgt. Andrew A. Ramirez, 25, along the 
Macedonia-Yugoslavia border on March 31. They were released May 2, 
when Yugoslav authorities handed the soldiers over to the Rev. 
Jesse Jackson, who had negotiated their release. 
</P>
<P>
	When Stone's father flew to Germany last week to see him for the  
first time since his release, he brought with him a Red Wings shirt 
with Brendan Shanahan's No. 14.

<HEADLINE> Lawn Device Picks Up After Dog </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDINA, Minn. (AP) -- Mike Miller is building a  
multi-million-dollar business on things other people don't want to 
touch. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller's Hound Dog Products is the company behind the Poop  
Hound, a long-handled scooper with a raking arm that sweeps doggie 
droppings from the lawn into a plastic bag that can be released 
into the trash. 
</P>
<P>
	No bending. No touching.  
</P>
<P>
	Just mention dog poop and Miller's eyes shine as he thinks about  
the business potential. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are 53 million dogs in America and I'll bet you dollars  
to doughnuts every one of those dogs poops,'' Miller said. ``What's 
a bigger nuisance in the back yard than dog poop?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hound Products makes four other products for the lawn and  
garden. 
</P>
<P>
	Its first, the Weed Hound, was introduced in 1995. About 900,000  
of the long-handled weeders have been sold through U.S. retailers 
such as Coast to Coast, Eagle Hardware &AMP; Garden, Home Depot, 
Target, True Value, Wal-Mart and lawn and garden centers. Hound Dog 
products also are sold in Canada, Japan, France, Belgium, Germany 
and the United Kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also makes the Bulb Hound, a standup planter with  
movable spades that release soil like a post digger; the Turf 
Hound, a lawn aerating tool that removes 4-inch plugs of soil from 
lawns to break up thatch, and the Edge Hound, used to remove grass 
encroaching on sidewalks and to install vinyl lawn and garden 
edging. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the tools has a suggested retail price of $25.  
</P>
<P>
	Hound Dog, which has seven employees, expects sales of more than  
$6 million this year and $10 million in 2000. Miller hopes to grow 
revenues to $50 million by 2005 by adding new products each year. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is developing a garden cultivator; a compact Poop  
Hound for taking on walks with the dog; and an ice chopper. 
</P>
<P>
	All Hound Dog products are designed with two customers in mind --  
Emma, a hypothetical 60- to 70-year-old woman with limited grip 
strength, and Bubba, an imagined 300-pound customer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We build it for Emma and make sure that Bubba can't break  
it,'' Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is based in this Minneapolis suburb, and its  
products are made by robots at a plant in Watertown, about 30 miles 
west of Minneapolis. During peak production months, 23,000 tools 
are produced each week. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller started in business as a sales representative for Procter  
&AMP; Gamble and later worked for Pillsbury and ConAgra. When he turned 
30, he started looking for a business of his own and took out a 
newspaper ad seeking a venture. 
</P>
<P>
	One man who answered wanted a partner in a real estate deal.  
When Miller wasn't interested, the man said he had an invention in 
the garage to show Miller. After being injured in a construction 
accident, he had built the tool to help with his yard work. 
</P>
<P>
	``He called it the 'green machine.' My eyes widened and I said  
we should test it,'' Miller recalled. He took three-dozen of the 
tools to a local garden store, they sold out and the store ordered 
another hundred. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, with his stepfather as a minority shareholder, signed a  
license agreement with the inventor and has worldwide rights to the 
tool, which was refined to become the Weed Hound. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller thinks there is potential to sell 4 million Weed Hounds,  
but he thinks the Poop Hound will be his best-seller. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we can sell 5 to 6 million Poop Hounds,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The idea behind the Poop Hound came from a bank Miller had as a  
child. 
</P>
<P>
	``A hand would come out and grab the penny. That's what the Poop  
Hound does,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Poop Hound was introduced in January after extensive  
testing. For the skeptics who might wonder if it really works, ``We 
tested it with mashed potatoes,'' Miller said.

<HEADLINE> Landslide Reminds of Hawaii Dangers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAUULA, Hawaii (AP) -- From its volcanic peaks to its  
crystal-blue waters, Hawaii is a place of both beauty and danger. 
</P>
<P>
	Several tourists die each year during their dream vacations.  
They have been battered by pounding winter surf, attacked by 
man-eating tiger sharks, steamed to death in a volcano or buried 
under giant rocks -- which happened to dozens of visitors Sunday at 
Sacred Falls State Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight people are confirmed dead from the landslide, another is  
missing and presumed dead and 12 more remain hospitalized. 
Boulders, some the size of compact cars, rained down on visitors 
swimming in a pool beneath a 90-foot waterfall. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten people have died at Sacred Falls from landslides and flash  
floods since 1970, yet it remains one of the island's most popular 
tourist attractions with 56,000 annual visitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``They come here to fulfill their fantasies,'' said Capt. Ken  
Rust of Honolulu's water safety division. ``But they are unaware of 
the hazards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Or they ignore them.  
</P>
<P>
	For example, Sandy Beach in eastern Honolulu injures more  
swimmers than any beach in the state, despite 30 warning signs 
fixed in the sand and ocean-conditions signs placed there daily by 
lifeguards. Waves there break close to the shoreline, driving body 
surfers into the ocean floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``People think it won't happen to them,'' Rust said.  
</P>
<P>
	Hawaii visitors, military personnel and locals often  
underestimate the dangers of adventure outings to snorkel, surf, 
Jet Ski, kayak, hike and bike the islands. And those dangers can be 
glossed over by tour companies fighting for survival. 
</P>
<P>
	With more than 6 million annual visitors to the islands, tourism  
is Hawaii's No. 1 industry. Tourists spend about $11 billion a year 
in the Aloha State, generating a quarter of its tax revenues and a 
third of its jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Consequently, tourist deaths in Hawaii are not uncommon. Just  
recently: 
</P>
<P>
	--A 29-year-old Californian was killed by a shark off Maui while  
kayaking with her husband. He accused the kayak rental company of 
not warning them enough about the dangers of ocean paddling. 
</P>
<P>
	--A 31-year-old man from Washington state drowned while swimming  
in waters off Kauai with his fiancee. 
</P>
<P>
	--A 44-year-old Japanese woman was killed when her Jet Ski was  
broadsided by another. The accident prompted state officials to 
consider changes in safety rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not Disneyland,'' said Janet Babb, who offers tours of  
Hawaii Volcanoes National Park on the Big Island. ``It's hard to 
convince people that this is Mother Nature and we can't control 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Babb's tours explore the wonders of Kilauea Volcano, which  
has been erupting almost constantly since January 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, five people have died in the park, including a local  
man who fell into 2,000-degree lava and a Colorado woman who became 
trapped in a steam vent near the volcano's crater. Park ranger 
Mardi Lane said they both had disregarded signs indicating the area 
was closed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The overwhelming majority of people who visit the park take  
our warnings seriously,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, Ms. Babb stopped taking people to see the lava flow  
entering the ocean because of the dangers to them -- from molten 
rock, poisonous sulphuric acid or an earthquake -- and potential 
liability to her.

<HEADLINE> Star Wars Actress: What's the Fuss? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Swedish actress Pernilla August says she's  
puzzled by all the fuss over the new ``Star Wars'' movie. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I really get it, what it is about,'' said Ms.  
August, who plays Anakin Skywalker's mother in ``Star Wars: Episode

countryside with my kids. Really -- I don't know the consequences of 
this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. August didn't see the original movie when it was first  
released. But she went last year with one of her daughters when the 
remastered version came out.

<HEADLINE> ValuJet Crash Memorial Dedicated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EVERGLADES NATIONAL PARK, Fla. (AP) -- A memorial with 110  
concrete columns topped by pyramids was dedicated Tuesday to the 
people who died three years ago when a ValuJet plane plunged into a 
swamp. 
</P>
<P>
	About 150 people from as far away as Italy attended the  
ceremony, held near the crash site. Many had images of the 110 
victims pinned to their lapels, printed on T-shirts or held in 
picture frames. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never get over it,'' said Richard Kessler, whose wife,  
Kathleen, died while returning home to Atlanta after attending 
their daughter's graduation at the University of Miami. ``The old 
myth is time heals and you get on with your life. But as we all 
know, you carry this pain the rest of your life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Volunteers designed and built the monument, which rests on a  
grassy knoll a few yards from a levee. The concrete block columns, 
topped by four-sided pyramids, are set apart equally in rows. 
</P>
<P>
	The columns rest on a triangular platform that points toward the  
crash site. A center aisle divides the rows, widening as the 
structure rises. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me the design is an allegory, the rise of the victim's  
souls and the fall of the fateful plane,'' said Lee Sawyer, a 
teacher whose parents died in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Chemical oxygen generators ignited in the cargo hold of ValuJet  
Flight 592, sending flames tearing through the floor of the 
passenger cabin. The plane nose-dived into the swamp at 460 mph 
minutes after it took off from Miami for Atlanta.

	LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Thieves crawled through a hole they drilled in  
a Peruvian monastery's front door, punched in a second glass door 
and stole 13 religious paintings, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The thieves cut 13 of 42 Cuzco School religious paintings out of  
their frames with knives Sunday in the Santa Rosa Monastery in 
Arequipa, said Luis Sardon, director of Peru's National Culture 
Institute. Arequipa is 465 miles southeast of Lima. 
</P>
<P>

	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- President Carlos Menem has  
launched a $600 million plan to create or preserve 1.2 million 
jobs, the Labor Ministry said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Double-digit joblessness is a leading concern in Argentina. The  
government last reported in October 1998 that nationwide 
unemployment stood at 12.4 percent.

	The plan calls for reducing payroll taxes to encourage employers  
to create jobs, offering temporary wage compensation for newly

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexico's ruling party has promised to crack  
down on excessive or improper spending amid a costly media campaign 
for the presidential nomination, newspapers reported Tuesday. 
</P>

	President Ernesto Zedillo has promised to prevent the use of  
public funds by presidential hopefuls from his Institutional 
Revolutionary Party, party chairman Jose Antonio Gonzalez Fernandez 
was quoted as saying by Mexico City dailies.

	The sharpest criticism has been aimed at Roberto Madrazo,  
governor of the Gulf Coast state of Tabasco, who has boasted of his 
accomplishments in a series of slick, state-financed television

<HEADLINE> Browns Sign Linebacker Jamir Miller </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The expansion Cleveland Browns filled one of  
their thinnest positions Tuesday, agreeing to a one-year contract 
with unrestricted free agent outside linebacker Jamir Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	But Miller also comes to his new team with some old baggage -- a  
history of off-the-field legal problems that could be a concern to 
the Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, who played the last five seasons for Arizona and turned  
down a two-year deal from the Cardinals in March, will make $1.3 
million this season and could earn an additional $900,000 with 
incentives. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns finalized the deal on Tuesday with Miller's agent,  
Leigh Steinberg. 
</P>
<P>
	``The one-year contract allows Jamir to be in a situation where  
he'll certainly start and showcase himself, and if the experience 
in Cleveland ends up being a great one, that will lead them to 
renegotiate before the year's up,'' Steinberg told The Tribune, an 
Arizona newspaper. ``If for whatever reason he's unsure, he'll 
become an unrestricted free agent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A 1994 first-round pick out of UCLA, Miller led the Cardinals in  
tackles last season with 150 -- including 87 solos. The 6-foot-5, 
266-pounder also recorded three sacks and started in all 16 games 
for the third straight year in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller should immediately move into the starting outside  
linebacking position for the Browns, who are planning to use a base 
4-3 defense in their first year back in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller will likely start alongside Chris Spielman and John  
Thierry, giving the Browns a solid linebacking corps. Lenoy Jones 
had been penciled in as the Browns' starter on the weak side. 
</P>
<P>
	``The addition of Jamir Miller fills a hole at the outside  
linebacking position,'' said Dwight Clark, Cleveland's director of 
football operations. ``He has an outstanding combination of speed 
and size, and his NFL experience will enable him to provide 
leadership in the locker room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, 25, is the second high-profile player to leave the  
Cardinals for the Browns. Offensive left tackle Lomas Brown joined 
Cleveland earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	A potential downside for the Browns could be Miller's past  
off-field problems. In 1995, he violated the NFL's substance abuse 
policy and was suspended for the first four regular-season games of 
the '95 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, who left UCLA after his junior season, also had problems  
in college. He was arrested for possession of a loaded firearm and 
later for possession of $13,000 worth of computer and stereo 
equipment stolen from a UCLA residence hall. 
</P>
<P>
	He pleaded no contest to both charges and was placed on  
probation.

<HEADLINE> Public Accepts Military Errors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The military got little grief from the home  
front when a Baghdad shelter was attacked in the Persian Gulf War 
and more than 300 civilians killed in carnage shown on TV. Support 
for the bombing campaign remained overwhelming, and planners 
pressed ahead for the ground war less than two weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
	A mistaken bombing, however horrendous, rarely throws warriors  
off course, military historians say. But the attack on the Chinese 
Embassy in Belgrade may be different. 
</P>
<P>
	In World War II, it was taken for granted that bombs would kill  
mass numbers of civilians and land in unexpected places. ``If they 
were lucky they could hit a city,'' war historian Harry Summers 
said. ``But they were not sure where.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With total war going on then, few Americans stopped to worry  
about German or Japanese innocents. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Gulf War, standards had changed, thanks to precision  
technology. But the bombing of the shelter -- as with the embassy 
bombing, a failure of intelligence, not targeting -- was seen as an 
anomaly. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could measure progress toward the objectives,'' said  
William J. Taylor Jr., at the Center for Strategic and 
International Studies. People could see that the war effort was 
succeeding and that mistakes in such a huge enterprise were bound 
to happen. 
</P>
<P>
	Without that sense now, Taylor said, the embassy bombing could  
interfere with the conduct of the war. ``It's going to complicate 
it enormously,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers, distinguished fellow at the U.S. Army War College, said  
the sheer incompetence suggested by the embassy attack may be 
NATO's greatest problem. ``My God, not knowing where the Chinese 
Embassy is,'' he began. ``It's so gross a malfeasance that it's 
almost impossible to conceive. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been a relative lack of American outrage over civilian  
casualties,'' he said. ``This may sensitize people as to what's 
going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In attacking an embassy, a nation's hallowed ground abroad, NATO  
has antagonized a member of the U.N. Security Council just as 
diplomacy in the United Nations was ready to play a greater role. 
The attack also followed a series of targeting accidents that have 
left scores of Yugoslav civilians dead, even if the bulk of the 
bombing has achieved remarkable accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a much different kind of problem,'' says Richard  
Betts, director of national security studies at the Council on 
Foreign Relations. ``It creates a disastrous situation with another 
great power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, it may have given Yugoslav President Slobodan  
Milosevic another propaganda victory, following up on his release 
of three American soldiers and preceded by his offer Monday -- 
dismissed by NATO -- to withdraw some forces from Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Milosevic is playing chess, while we're playing checkers,''  
Taylor said. ``He's always one step ahead of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the Baghdad shelter was hit Feb. 13, 1991, U.S. officials  
said it was a military command center, and they did not know 
civilians were inside. They eased up on bombing Baghdad 
temporarily. At least eight in 10 Americans continued to support 
the air war in opinion surveys; 92 percent in one major poll said 
the attack was a tragedy but unavoidable in wartime. 
</P>
<P>
	``That had almost no impact on American public opinion,'' said  
John Mueller, who studies the presidency and war at the University 
of Rochester. Even though Americans showed little hostility to the 
Iraqi people -- in contrast to the vilification of Germans and 
Japanese in World War II -- ``their accidental killing was basically 
accepted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With casualties from the NATO campaign apparently fairly light,  
Mueller says the latest mistake may not have great consequence in 
U.S. public opinion or in NATO's ability to prosecute the air war. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overwhelmingly, the thing that Americans are sensitive to is  
American casualties,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	And that, he believes, was central in sapping support for the  
Vietnam War. He says anti-war activists played up North Vietnamese 
civilian casualties to little effect. 
</P>
<P>
	Historians point to no particular bombing mistake that  
undermined that war. Instead, the feeling inexorably grew among 
Americans that the war itself was one very bad mistake indeed.

<HEADLINE> Heat, Knicks Head to New York Tied  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PURCHASE, N.Y. (AP) -- Somewhere in the wide zone between  
delighted and dismayed sat the New York Knicks on Tuesday, their 
minds eased by the memory of Game 1 but their confidence shaken by 
what happened in Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
	The key in Wednesday night's Game 3 will be which Knicks team  
shows up -- the aggressive, efficient team on display in the series 
opener or the selfish, shooting-impaired bunch from Monday night's 
loss at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal was to win two games, and that's what we went down  
there to do,'' Allan Houston said. ``What's disappointing is that 
we played a lot differently in Game 2, and in the playoffs you 
can't afford to do so. This isn't the regular season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was no panic in the air as the Knicks watched film and  
went through an easy practice in preparation for Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick Ewing was his usual post-practice self, blowing past  
reporters without so much as a word. And Jeff Van Gundy had a laugh 
at his own expense, noting that he was using many of the same 
phrases, like ``playing with passion,'' that he had dismissed just 
last week as meaningless. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes I use those same cliches to my advantage,'' Van  
Gundy said 
</P>
<P>
	Neither game has gone down to the finish, the Knicks winning the  
first one by 20 points after withstanding Miami's final run in the 
third quarter, and the Heat winning by 10 Monday night by turning 
back New York's final surge midway through the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	To a man, the Knicks pointed out that they need to pass the ball  
better and create easier shots to overcome the type of tough 
defense that the Heat played in Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``We weren't really passing the ball to each other. We only had  
11 assists for the game, and Tim Hardaway had 11 assists alone,'' 
Marcus Camby said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the defensive end, the Knicks know they need to reinject some  
of the franchise's old toughness. 
</P>
<P>
	``Alonzo (Mourning) had seven layups or dunks, and Mash (Jamal  
Mashburn) came down the lane and had a finger roll with no contact 
at all. In games like this, you have to send them to the line,'' 
Camby said. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the Knicks is shooting either terribly well or terribly  
poorly, but the team has had to adjust to shrinking offensive 
production from Ewing, who is hampered by Achilles tendinitis. 
Latrell Sprewell is the Knicks' leading scorer, averaging 18.5, and 
New York needs more point production from at least one of its 
starters -- be it Houston, Kurt Thomas or Charlie Ward -- to 
duplicate the success of Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami found a way to win Game 2 while getting just one basket  
from Hardaway, their main offensive threat after Mourning. Terry 
Porter and Mashburn had 11 points each, while P.J. Brown had 12. 
</P>
<P>
	The main factor was defense, with the Heat not allowing the  
number of uncontested shots -- in fact, they hardly allowed any -- 
that they did in Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``Defense is our crutch, something we take great pride in,''  
Mourning said. ``We're not a team that can outscore you. That's not 
our strategy. For the most part we rely on our defense. It 
definitely made a difference (in Game 2). We don't want to get into 
a scoring battle with them.''

<HEADLINE> Morning Show Stunts Suffer Setbacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hitting the road is a time-honored ratings stunt  
for morning news shows. But this week, the road is hitting back. 
</P>
<P>
	After enduring an uncomfortable night on the side of Mount  
Everest, Matt Lauer of NBC's ``Today'' show was prevented Tuesday 
from traveling to a second mystery location when the Indian 
government grounded his chartered plane. 
</P>
<P>
	Hostile weather in this country forced Charles Gibson, Diane  
Sawyer and the crew of ABC's ``Good Morning America'' to travel 10 
hours by bus from Austin, Texas, to New Orleans in time for 
Tuesday's show -- and another downpour. 
</P>
<P>
	Both shows are traveling to drum up interest during a ratings  
``sweeps'' month. For the second straight year, NBC's ``Where in 
the world is Matt Lauer'' promotion sends the anchorman on a 
week-long mystery tour to destinations unknown to viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	He made it to the slopes of the world's tallest mountain Monday,  
but it's been all downhill since. 
</P>
<P>
	Fog obscured views of the peak and prevented Lauer from leaving  
after Monday's show. He was stuck in a shack with his wife, model 
Annette Roque Lauer, eating ravioli and crackers, and sleeping in 
sleeping bags. There was no running water, only an outhouse 
accessible after a jog in the freezing cold. 
</P>
<P>
	The fog finally lifted enough for Lauer to get off the mountain  
and fly to Katmandu, Nepal. But he waited on a runway there for 
more than six hours when officials refused permission to fly over 
Indian airspace. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time Lauer finally took off, it was too late to reach his  
second destination in time for Tuesday's show, said Jeff Zucker, 
``Today'' executive producer. He was rerouted in the air to his 
planned third destination. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC scrambled overnight to fill time, calling former ``Partridge  
Family'' actor Danny Bonaduce after midnight for an interview on 
the perils of child stardom. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all part of the game,'' Zucker said. ``In order to score  
big, you've got to take big chances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Good Morning America'' picked Austin for its first stop in a  
bus tour of the South. But Gibson and Sawyer were planning to cheat 
Monday -- traveling by plane to Lafayette, La. -- and ride the bus 
from there to New Orleans. Instead, their plane was grounded and 
everyone had to make the long drive. 
</P>
<P>
	Lafayette, and about 2,000 people who were waiting to greet the  
crew, were bypassed. 
</P>
<P>
	In New Orleans, a downpour Tuesday forced ``GMA'' to move its  
broadcast site from the outdoor Jackson Square to the nearby 
Pontalbo Cafe. The Neville Brothers had to cancel a performance 
because their equipment was drenched, said Shelley Ross, the show's 
executive producer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were all calm,'' Ross said. ``A zen came over our  
production. In a funny way, I think we had a better show. It had 
energy and spontaneity.''

<HEADLINE> 1 Still Missing From Okla. Storms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- The only person still missing after the  
deadly tornadoes is a 23-year-old mother of two who was pulled from 
a man's arms by a twister. 
</P>
<P>
	Tram Thu Bui had panicked and run into the path of the storm. A  
man grabbed her and tried desperately to save the woman as her 
husband struggled to do the same with their two children. 
</P>
<P>
	``The wind was so strong it pulled her right out of his arms,''  
her father-in-law, Bernie Beres, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The children and their father escaped with only scratches.  
</P>
<P>
	They are now awaiting word as searchers continue to pick through  
the debris in the Moore area for the young wife and mother. The May 
3 tornadoes killed 41 people in Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	Beres said his son, Thuanh, 29, his daughter-in-law and their  
children were on their way to his home in Moore for a surprise 
visit. The family lives in Seminole, about an hour away. 
</P>
<P>
	``They just decided to come visit Grandpa,'' Beres said. ``They  
just happened to run right into it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beres said the family was traveling on Interstate 35 when they  
had to stop because cars ahead of them had slowed for the 
approaching storm. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't have a radio in his car,'' Beres said of his son.  
``When he slowed down, he just thought it was bad weather. All of a 
sudden people were running out of their cars.'' They shouted, 
``Tornado, tornado!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thuanh got out of the car with their 3-year-old daughter and  
2 1/2-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
	Beres said of his daughter-in-law, ``I don't think she's ever  
been in one. I don't think my son had ever been in a tornado 
either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beres said his grandchildren don't really understand what is  
going on, but they did see what happened to their mother. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just pray to the Lord that the little ones are OK,'' he  
said.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Cindy Crawford is posing nude for two on the  
cover of W magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	The supermodel sheds her maternity togs and bares her  
seven-month belly on the cover of the latest issue. She's standing 
sideways with one hand covering her breasts and the other hand on

<P>
	``It's a miracle, yes,'' she told the magazine. ``But what can I  
say? I liked the way I looked in Playboy last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Photographers had planned to shoot Ms. Crawford, 33, in a loose  
evening dress but trashed the idea because she didn't look pregnant 
enough in the gown.

	``She looked like she might have had too many beers the night  
before,'' said photographer Michael Thompson.

<HEADLINE> Newest Bowl Features 2 Conferences </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOBILE, Ala. (AP) -- While organizers are still deciding on a  
final name for it, college football's newest bowl game announced a 
tie-in Tuesday with Conference USA and the Western Athletic 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The bowl, which is currently being called the Mobile, Alabama  
Bowl, will have the second selection of available teams from both 
the WAC and C-USA for the Dec. 22 game. 
</P>
<P>
	The C-USA signed a five-year deal to send its teams to the bowl,  
while the WAC signed for only one year. 
</P>
<P>
	The game offers a minimum $750,000 payout to each participating  
school. The city of Mobile is the main title sponsor of the bowl, 
pledging $950,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the city is the title sponsor, it decided to call the  
game the Mobile, Alabama Bowl. Residents hated it and made their 
own suggestions in a call-in survey to the Mobile Register. 
</P>
<P>
	Readers suggested names like the Mardi Gras Bowl, Seafood Bowl,  
Shrimp Bowl, Azalea Bowl, and so on with links to the community. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey said the Azalea Bowl, named for the city's trademark  
blossoms, was the most popular suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
	Mobile Mayor Mike Dow had this suggestion to solve the name  
game, which has drawn some less serious entries like Bubba Bowl, 
Pawn Shop Bowl or the Big Oyster Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow said he would call it: Mobile Azalea Mardi Gras Port City  
Alabama Bowl -- or MAMGPCAB -- for short. 
</P>
<P>
	In all seriousness, though, Dow said he wants the city's name to  
remain. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you talk to the commissioners and professionals in the  
industry, they think the idea of putting Mobile in the name is 
paramount,'' Dow said. ``We've got enough fans around here to fill 
up that stadium. With the number of fans coming from the outside, 
we're going to be more concerned trying to find seats for local 
people.''

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stock Prices Finish Lower / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stock prices finished lower Tuesday as  
investors locked in profits following recent rapid advances. The 
U.S. dollar fell against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average dropped 233.83  
points, or 1.38 percent, closing at 16,743.18. On Monday, the 
average gained 30.49 points, or 0.18 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.62 yen at mid-afternoon, down 0.24 yen  
from late Monday in Tokyo but above its late New York level of 
120.50 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, investors took profits after the Nikkei  
index surged to close at 17,300.61 points on Thursday -- its highest 
finish since Oct. 24, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Nikkei's 17,000 level prompts selling, but the downside is  
seen solid,'' said Hiroichi Nishi, deputy general manager at Nikko 
Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese blue chips were mixed following the sluggish  
performance of their U.S. counterparts overnight on Wall Street and 
the yen's rise against the dollar Monday, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong yen tends to make Japanese exports more expensive and  
thus less competitive abroad, while making imports cheaper in 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 18.04 points, or 1.31 percent, to 1,355.82 
points. The TOPIX closed up 5.44 points, or 0.40 percent, Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar slipped on news late Monday  
that the Yugoslav army had announced a partial withdrawal of 
military and police forces in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	But trades remained in a narrow range in the absence of fresh  
incentives. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market today had no energy and was completely lifeless,''

<HEADLINE> Coelho Named Gore Campaign Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former Rep. Tony Coelho, a prominent  
Democratic strategist and architect of the party's failed 1994 
midterm election strategy, will be general chairman of Al Gore's 
presidential effort, the campaign announced today. 
</P>
<P>
	He takes over a political operation that stumbled out of the  
gates, but has shown signs of rebounding in recent weeks. Gore is 
the early front-runner for the Democratic nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``His political and private-sector experience, his tireless  
energy and his devotion to public service will make a strong 
campaign even stronger,'' Gore said in a statement. ``I am thrilled 
he is joining our team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coelho responded: ``It is because I believe in Al Gore, the  
strength of his leadership, the power of his ideas and the values 
he brings to public life that I am going to do everything I can to 
help him become our next president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Campaign officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said  
Coelho main task will be to give direction to a troika of interests 
inside the Gore team: The campaign staff, Gore's White House staff 
and his outside consultants. Gore aides and Democratic operatives 
have complained that the three interests do not always work well 
together -- and often are at odds. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore leads his only Democratic rival, former New Jersey Sen.  
Bill Bradley, by at least 20 percentage points in most public 
opinion polls. More sure-footed in recent days, Gore's poll numbers 
have improved. But he has been prone to gaffes, and slow to respond 
to the miscues, as Bradley has threatened to close the gap. 
</P>
<P>
	Polls also show Gore trailing early GOP favorite George W. Bush  
in head-to-head match-ups. 
</P>
<P>
	The hiring of a campaign chairman is not a surprise, though the  
Coelho's name had not been mentioned in public before Monday. 
Officials said the move does not undercut Gore's consultants or top 
aides at the campaign and White House. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the advisers compared it to President Clinton's 1992  
campaign, when California lawyer Mickey Kantor was brought in to 
calm turf wars between the campaign staff and Clinton's political 
team in Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	Kantor became U.S. trade representative and commerce secretary  
under Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaign manager Craig Smith will continue to supervise the  
campaign staff and its budget. And the vice president's schedule 
and day-to-day operation will still be controlled by his White 
House chief of staff, Ron Klain. 
</P>
<P>
	Coelho, a former House majority whip, quit Congress in 1989 amid  
an investigation into his personal finances. The campaign says 
Coelho, an investment banker, was cleared by the Justice Department 
of what was a technical violation of House reporting rules. 
</P>
<P>
	While in Congress, Coelho was perhaps the most adroit political  
operator among the House Democrats. In the early 1980s, he 
transformed the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee into a 
modern and powerful organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Coelho headed the Democratic election effort in 1994, when  
Republicans won control of both houses of Congress.

<HEADLINE> Calvin Klein Loses Perfume Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A judge Monday rejected Calvin Klein's claim  
that something doesn't smell right about Ralph Lauren's new women's 
perfume being marketed in a similar-looking bottle. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge John E. Sprizzo issued a preliminary ruling  
saying he did not find enough similarities between Lauren's Romance 
and Klein's Eternity to rule in Klein's favor. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted the Eternity bottle is tall and thin with a curved  
T-shaped silver cap while the Romance bottle is short and squat 
with a flat and square silver cap. He also said the walls of 
Lauren's bottle, though slightly curved, are not like Klein's 
bottle, whose walls are straight. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the dissimilarities though, the judge said the  
``likelihood of consumer confusion is also minimized by the 
differing marketing techniques employed by the parties and the 
prominent inclusion of the ``Romance'' name on the bottle cap and 
box.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Klein brought the case to federal court in Manhattan in June  
when it learned that the Ralph Lauren was bringing the new 
fragrance to market. 
</P>
<P>
	Ira Jay Levy, a lawyer for Ralph Lauren, said the product has  
sold well since it was introduced last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Calvin Klein said the lawsuit had already brought about  
improvements because Ralph Lauren changed its bottle to include a 
label with the product's name around the collar of the bottle's 
cap.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft, Konami To Share Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REDMOND, Wash. (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. and Japan's Konami Co.  
have agreed to publish each other's games on other systems, marking 
the first time both companies have strayed outside their core game 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Konami, a large video game publisher based in Tokyo, will  
publish Microsoft's games on systems such as Nintendo 64, Sony 
PlayStation and the Sega Dreamcast, Dow Jones News Service reported 
Tuesday. Microsoft, meanwhile, will adapt Konami titles for the 
personal computer. The first titles resulting from the deal will be 
announced this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Traditionally, Microsoft has published its game titles only on  
the PC, though it has licensed individual titles on occasion for 
the Sony PlayStation and Nintendo 64. But the new deal will allow 
Konami to choose any of Microsoft's titles and publish them for 
other platforms, and vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Fries, general manager of the Microsoft games business, said  
the deal will help Microsoft develop new sources of revenue for the 
titles already selling on the PC. Microsoft still will aim its 
games first for the PC. But Fries said more game players are 
switching between systems, so the deal makes sense. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Dunley, vice president of marketing at Konami of America in  
San Mateo, Calif., said more of his company's games such as the 
multimillion seller ``Metal Gear Solid'' are aimed at adult 
audiences, making it more sensible to adapt the titles to the PC, 
which tends to draw older players. 
</P>
<P>
	Both companies also noted that the alliance was a strategy to  
deal with growing consolidation in the games business.

<HEADLINE>  New Offer May Seek To Move Penguins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Pittsburgh inched closer Tuesday to joining  
Hartford, Winnipeg, Quebec and other cities that lost NHL teams 
with a new buyer's offer of $85 million to move the Pittsburgh 
Penguins. 
</P>
<P>
	NHL attorney Jeffrey Levitan revealed the offer during a hearing  
on the league's request for quick work on the fate of the team, 
which is in U.S. Bankruptcy Court proceedings for the second time 
in 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The buyer is believed to be Paul Allen, the Seattle billionaire  
who also owns the NFL's Seattle Seahawks and NBA's Portland Trail 
Blazers. The Penguins would provide another wintertime tenant for 
the Rose Garden in Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	NHL commissioner Gary Bettman would not confirm Allen's bid  
during a news conference minutes before the Maple Leafs-Penguins 
playoff game Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have not finalized or signed a deal with anyone,'' Bettman  
said. ``If there's speculation that's a done deal, I think people 
are getting ahead of themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trail Blazers officials, who act as Allen's public-relations arm  
and fielded calls Tuesday about the rumors, denied that Allen had 
made an offer for the Penguins. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody has bid on the Penguins,'' said Melinda Gable, the  
Blazers' director of corporate and community affairs. But Allen's 
enterprise will continue to evaluate NHL teams for possible 
relocation to Portland, the team said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Bettman said the NHL remains firmly behind Hall of Famer Mario  
Lemieux's reorganization plan, but time is growing tight as 
planning already is underway for the 1999-2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are fully supportive of Mario's plan, but there are a  
variety of conditions that must be satisfied first,'' Bettman said, 
citing a renegotiated arena lease as the first priority. 
</P>
<P>
	SMG, which operates the Civic Arena, is not to blame for the  
Penguins' financial mess, Bettman said, but he cautioned that the 
Lemieux plan will not go through unless SMG renegotiates. The 
Penguins currently pay $5 million-$6 million a year to play in the 
38-year-old Civic Arena, the oldest in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	``This club is not viable in Pittsburgh without a new lease,''  
Bettman said. ``We would like to have the Pens reorganized in 
Pittsburgh, but if it (the Lemieux plan) fails, we have to look at 
alternatives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL also could liquidate the Penguins and disperse its  
players in a draft among the other league teams. But Bettman said 
that will occur only if the alternative owner decides he doesn't 
have enough time to market the Penguins in a new city for next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The new bid represents $35 million more than Lemieux's $50  
million cash bid endorsed by the NHL, so the team's 200 creditors 
stand to earn more from it. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Chuck Greenberg, Lemieux's attorney, said the  
assumption of debt by the Lemieux group will eventually make his 
bid more attractive. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not surprised that another party is interested in the  
team. There were a number of bidders who emerged the last time the 
league expanded,'' Greenberg said. ``We are not going to concern 
ourselves with what might happen if our bid is not confirmed. We 
want to put all our energies into making this a viable franchise in 
Pittsburgh.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The offer mentioned by Levitan is $30 million less than the  
recent reported price for the Tampa Bay Lightning, who finished at 
19-54-9 and unlike the Penguins missed this year's playoffs. But 
the Lightning plays in a nearly new arena, the Ice Palace, that is 
controlled by the team's new ownership. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial trouble and uncertainty about the looming season have  
reduced the Penguins' value, said William Daly, the league's vice 
president for legal affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are not ideal conditions under which to be selling a  
sports franchise,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A court and creditors' review of the NHL's plan to dissolve the  
Penguins has been scheduled for 11 a.m. May 19. 
</P>
<P>
	That is 12 days before the NHL's deadline for resolving Penguins  
ownership and the same day as Game 7, if necessary, in the current 
playoff series with Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly said the league wants to begin scheduling for next season  
and needs to know how many teams it will have and whether they will 
travel to Pittsburgh or another city for games. 
</P>
<P>
	The league is using the prospect of losing the team to push the  
Penguins toward Lemieux and his investors, although the tone of 
court proceedings has become more grave as the deadline nears. 
</P>
<P>
	``The longer it goes, the harder it is for the league,'' Bettman  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Las Vegas and Kansas City are among the other U.S. cities that  
have been trying to get hockey teams. Roger Marino, one of the 
Penguins' three owners along with Howard Baldwin and Morris 
Belzberg, traveled there and elsewhere to pitch the Penguins. 
</P>
<P>
	At the May 19 hearing, Judge Bernard Markovitz could schedule  
votes by creditors on the NHL's plan and the Lemieux bid, perhaps 
simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want our alternative plan put on the same track as the  
Lemieux plan,'' Bettman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest creditors, the Penguins' banks and insurers, and the  
NHL want the votes to happen at the same time. But other creditors 
object, saying that could be confusing. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge faulted the NHL for waiting so long to prepare its  
plan. Levitan said the league held back at first because it did not 
want to upset negotiations with prospective buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux, who is owed $26.2 million in deferred salary and is the  
Penguins' biggest unsecured creditor, is courting Broadcast.com 
founder Mark Cuban, a native of suburban Pittsburgh, as a potential 
investor. They met again on Tuesday afternoon, Greenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins' banks, insurers, equipment suppliers, bond  
holders, former players and other creditors are owed $125 million. 
The team lost $10 million last year and did not sell out recent 
home playoff games with New Jersey, though its first two home games 
against Toronto are sellouts. 
</P>
<P>
	The team's troubles stem from long-term deals that Baldwin,  
strapped for cash after losing $25 million during the 1994-95 
lockout season, signed with Fox Sports and SMG. He received money 
upfront that kept the team in business.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll at 7 in Hawaii Landslide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAUULA, Hawaii (AP) -- A 29-year-old tourist died Tuesday from  
injuries suffered in a landslide at one of Hawaii's most 
spectacular hiking spots, increasing the death toll to seven with 
an eighth person presumed dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Johnson of Los Angeles was among dozens of hikers sunning  
themselves near a 90-foot waterfall Sunday afternoon when boulders, 
some the size of small cars, came crashing down. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson had been hospitalized in critical condition since.  
</P>
<P>
	His 24-year-old sister, Jenifer, also was killed at the  
landslide in Sacred Falls State Park. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear whether the Johnsons were related to Sarah  
Johnson, 24, of Hayward, Calif., who was missing and presumed dead. 
Officials believe she was buried under rocks or water. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Johnson, a Navy veteran, was scheduled to graduate Monday  
night from Chaminade University. He spent the last three years as a 
radioman first class at Barbers Point Naval Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve people, including five children, remained hospitalized  
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Geoffrey Scott, chief resident at University of California,  
Irvine, Medical Center's head and neck surgery department, recalled 
at a news conference Tuesday how he, his wife and two children, 
ages 5 and 8, were just 50 yards from the falls when the landslide 
started. 
</P>
<P>
	At first they mistook the roar for a flash flood. But when no  
water followed, the Scotts moved closer to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
	``The worst images of the worst horror movie you could imagine  
pale in comparison,'' Scott said. ``There were bodies throughout 
the area. Some had severe trauma and there were severed body 
parts,'' Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
	The surgeon and other bystanders began lifting the injured out  
of an area littered with rocks, trees and debris. They carried 
about 10 people to safety, but fearing more landslides, they had to 
leave two behind.

<HEADLINE> Hawks, Mutombo Lead Pistons 2-0  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- He has heard and read the Mount  
Mutombo comments. They don't bother him. Dikembe Mutombo is a man 
on a mission. 
</P>
<P>
	Right now, the early work on that mission appears nearly  
complete. 
</P>
<P>
	Behind the inspired play of Mutombo, Atlanta's 7-foot-2 center,  
the Hawks take a 2-0 lead over Detroit into Game 3 of their 
best-of-5 first-round series Wednesday night at The Palace. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like to be mean on the floor,'' Mutombo said. ``I have no  
friends out there. After the game, I'll hug you and say `Hi' to 
you. When we're on the floor, we're on a mission.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If they can finish off the Pistons -- or when they do -- Mutombo  
and the Hawks will go on in search of a bigger prize. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, no one wearing a Detroit uniform has been able to  
control Mutombo at either end of the court. He burned the Pistons 
for 17 points, 19 rebounds and six blocks in the opener -- which 
Atlanta won 90-70. 
</P>
<P>
	``You just never get any easy baskets with him out there,''  
Pistons guard Joe Dumars said. ``During the course of a game you 
will normally get five or six easy baskets. You don't get those 
with him, and that magnifies everything else you do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Playing all but two minutes, he scored 28 points, grabbed a  
game-high 13 rebounds and virtually shut down any thought by the 
Pistons of driving the lane during an 89-69 rout in Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``The playoffs are where the great athletes come to play,''  
Mutombo said. ``They've been throwing a lot of bodies at me the 
last two games, trying to get me tired, trying to get me fatigued. 
But my body feels great. I feel great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pistons have complained that Mutombo positions himself  
illegally in the lane on just about every possession. Without help 
from game officials, however, they know there is only one way to 
move Mutombo out of there. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our big guys have to step out and make some shots,'' Detroit  
coach Alvin Gentry said. ``To challenge him in the paint is 
probably not the most intelligent thing to do, since he blocks a 
ton of shots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the Pistons haven't been able to make enough outside  
shots to lure Mutombo out of the lane. 
</P>
<P>
	After scoring 26 points in the opener, making him the only  
Detroit player in double figures, Grant Hill was held to 15 points 
in Game 2 and went nearly 17 minutes in the second and third 
quarters without scoring. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with that subpar effort, he still led the Pistons in  
scoring. 
</P>
<P>
	Bison Dele, the Pistons' center, has been completely overmatched  
against Mutombo. He had just seven points and 12 rebounds with four 
fouls while playing 32 minutes in the opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Things got even worse in Game 2. Dele had no points, one rebound  
and picked up five fouls in just 11 minutes of playing time. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew we could take advantage of them because they don't  
have a dominant center,'' Hawks swingman Steve Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta forward Chris Crawford, with an mild shoulder  
separation, did not travel to Detroit on Tuesday, but was to join 
the team Wednesday if his condition improved. He was listed as 
day-to-day. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chris has been playing terrific for us,'' Hawks coach Lenny  
Wilkens said. ``When he went down, Ty (Corbin) came in and stepped 
up real big and played well for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Henderson also was held out of practice and was still  
wearing a patch over his injured left eye. He still has double 
vision from an abrasion late in the regular season. Henderson 
played only four minutes in Game 1 and not at all in Game 2 and was 
listed as questionable for Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
	The injuries mean the Hawks have lost three forwards who were  
with them at the start of the season. LaPhonso Ellis has been out 
since the 20th game because of a sports hernia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guys have been stepping up all year,'' Wilkens said. ``We've  
got, all of a sudden, three starting forwards out. We just keep 
playing hard. We don't take anything for granted. We're just going 
to go out and play as hard as we can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit has lost the first two games of a playoff series 10  
times in franchise history. The Pistons have never recovered from 
such a deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever we're doing wrong, we'd better fix it fast,'' Detroit  
guard Lindsey Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks have never lost a series after going up 2-0, winning  
on six previous occasions with such a lead. Atlanta's last 2-0 lead 
was the first round of the 1988 playoffs against Milwaukee. The 
Hawks won that series 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know they're a quality ballclub that hasn't played up to  
its capabilities in the first two games,'' Atlanta's Tyrone Corbin 
said. ``We can't afford to think it's over.''

<HEADLINE> $5 Billion Farm Aid Measure Shelved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Democrats on Tuesday dropped an effort  
to add $5 billion in farmer assistance to legislation paying for 
the U.S. bombing of Yugoslavia after failing to get GOP support for 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans said Tuesday it's too early to know how much farm  
aid will be needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know there's going to be a need but the administration  
hasn't sent up any request yet,'' said Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho. 
``We'll deal with the war, and then we'll come back to the ag 
issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House-Senate conference committee that's working on the  
spending legislation instead agreed Tuesday to provide $566 million 
in new emergency aid for farmers, $400 million above the request 
from President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	House and Senate negotiators hope to have the spending bill to  
President Clinton this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Farm-state Democrats last week suggested adding $4.3 billion in  
farm aid to the legislation, and this week fattened their proposal 
to $5.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sens. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, and Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., withdrew  
the proposal Tuesday because of opposition from other members of 
conference committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do intend to come back again,'' Harkin said.  
</P>
<P>
	Their package would include money to compensate farmers for  
slumping commodity prices and augment aid voted last year for 
producers who lost crops to drought and other weather-related 
problems.

<HEADLINE> King Family Claims Rights to Speech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Martin Luther King Jr. would not have wanted his  
``I Have a Dream'' speech used for commercial purposes without his 
approval, even though reporters got copies before it was delivered, 
a King family lawyer told a federal appeals court today. 
</P>
<P>
	The family is asking the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to  
rule that the famous speech is private property and that CBS News 
should have to pay for infringing on King's copyright by including 
footage from the speech in a documentary. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wouldn't have authorized this. He wouldn't have given away  
his most valuable work,'' said attorney Joseph Beck of Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal district judge ruled last year that the speech belongs  
to the public and CBS did not violate copyright law. The King 
family appealed to the 11th Circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine minutes of the 16-minute speech, delivered at the Lincoln  
Memorial during an Aug. 28, 1963, civil rights rally, were used in 
``The 20th Century with Mike Wallace,'' a documentary the network 
sold on videotape. 
</P>
<P>
	``CBS thought it was doing nothing wrong,'' said CBS lawyer  
Floyd Abrams. ``In fact, CBS thought it was genuinely serving the 
public in doing a documentary on the civil rights movement and the 
march on Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The King estate filed suit in 1996, seeking to stop CBS from  
using the footage in the documentary. According to the estate, King 
registered the speech with the U.S. Copyright Office shortly after 
the event. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS said the estate has no right to claim ownership of the  
footage, taken by CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	Last July, U.S. District Judge William O'Kelley ruled that King  
forfeited any copyright interest when he distributed advance copies 
without copyright notice, placed no restrictions on what use could 
be made of the speech and generally encouraged distribution. 
</P>
<P>
	First amendment experts say a ruling for the King estate could  
have serious implications for the use of public statements by 
individuals in news events. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's difficult to conceive of a more public speech. This is a  
speech given during the historic march on Washington. It has played 
a pivotal role in the history of the civil rights movement and it 
is the single speech that Dr. King is most remembered for,'' said 
Ken Paulson, executive director of the First Amendment Center at 
Vanderbilt University. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this kind of public speech can be treated as private  
property, then virtually anything can.''

</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Edwin L. Dale Jr., a former New York Times  
reporter and spokesman for the White House Office of Management and 
Budget, died of cancer Monday. He was 75. 
</P>
<P>
	Dale served as assistant director of public affairs at OMB  
between 1981 and 1987, providing a critical link between reporters 
and the Reagan administration. 
</P>
<P>
	He then spent two years as a counselor to Commerce Secretary C.  
William Verity before returning to the budget office as a director 
of external affairs. He worked in the area of policy studies before 
retiring in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Known for his mastery of the federal budget, Dale fielded a  
variety of queries from reporters, taking as many as 110 calls in a 
day during the height of budget season. 
</P>
<P>
	Dale came to Washington in 1951 as a reporter for the New York  
Herald Tribune. Four years later, he began covering economics for 
the Times. He spent several years in Paris, and later returned to 
Washington with assignments at the White House and the State 
Department. In 1977, Dale went to work on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the author of ``Conservatives in Power'' in 1960 and was  
the primary author of ``The People's Budget,'' published in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Philadelphia, Dale graduated from Yale University in  
1944 and served in the Navy during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife, Meredith, and two stepchildren.

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stewart Klein, a three-time Emmy Award-winner  
and a colorful movie and theater critic for television station WNYW 
for more than 30 years, died of a stroke Monday. He was 66 and had 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Klein joined the station in 1967 and became part of the original  
on-air team of ``The 10 O'Clock News.'' He also contributed theater 
and movie reviews to ``Good Day New York,'' and ``Fox Five Live.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1978, Klein won his first Emmy for a review of ``Sebastian,''  
a controversial film in Latin about St. Sebastian. Klein panned the 
film in Latin. The second Emmy came for his ``Ode To The Mets,'' in 
1986, to honor the World Series champs. His final Emmy, in 1994, 
was a lifetime achievement award. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1980, The Associated Press cited Klein for the year's best  
coverage of a breaking story, the death of director Gower Champion. 
</P>
<P>
	He made his debut in journalism as a copy boy for The  
Philadelphia Inquirer. He later joined the Daily Intelligencer as a 
reporter, and went on to the Philadelphia Daily News. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1959, Klein became news director for WCAU Radio in  
Philadelphia, then joined ABC News as a New York-based reporter in 
1961. There he was a featured ``Flair Reports'' reporter along with 
Charles Osgood and Ted Koppel. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1964, Klein joined WNEW Radio in New York, and became a  
regular arts and entertainment critic. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife, a son and three other children.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Shirley Dinsdale Layburn, a ventriloquist who  
won an Emmy Award in 1949, the first year the awards were 
presented, died Sunday of cancer. She was 72. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Layburn received her Emmy for Most Outstanding Television  
Personality. 
</P>
<P>
	Her show appeared on Paramount Studio's KTLA in Los Angeles and  
featured her and her puppet ``Judy Splinters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She later had her own children's show on KNBH-NBC, followed by  
several other shows on ABC in New York and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	She later quit her television career and from 1973 to 1985 was  
the head of the Respiratory Therapy Department of John T. Mather 
Memorial Hospital in Port Jefferson, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Layburn, who was born in San Francisco, began her  
ventriloquism career at age 14 with her radio show, ``Judy in 
Wonderland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She later moved to Hollywood, where she and her puppet had  
appearances on radio shows along personalities such as Rudy Vallee, 
Eddie Cantor and Bob Burns. 
</P>
<P>

elected to the New Jersey Senate and the longest-serving member of 
the upper house, died Sunday of cancer. She never disclosed her 
age; Democrats said she was about 70. 
</P>
<P>
	Lipman, first elected to the state Senate in 1971, had  
championed the causes of women, minorities, children and small 
businesses. Bills she had proposed that became law included 
measures to increase the penalties for adults who patronize child 
prostitutes, and to expand the state's domestic violence laws to 
protect more victims and provide more services for children. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 1989 forum on women and politics, Lipman recalled that when  
she was first elected, the Senate didn't even have rest room 
facilities for women.

<HEADLINE> Dole Opposes Concealed Weapons Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON -- Elizabeth Dole, distinguishing herself from  
front-runner George W. Bush and the rest of the GOP presidential 
field, said Tuesday that Americans should not be allowed to carry 
concealed weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think police work is hard enough already,'' she told a group  
of working women Tuesday night. Mrs. Dole added, however, that the 
issue is ultimately in the hands of state legislators. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the remarks moved the former American Red Cross president  
squarely in the political middle on the contentious gun control 
issue, leaving some GOP consultants wondering whether conservative 
primary voters will accept the stance. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is odd. It's certainly attention-getting for the national  
media,'' Republican consultant Michael Hudome said. ``But it 
probably won't work in a Republican primary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Scott Reed, who managed the 1996 presidential campaign  
of Dole's husband, Bob Dole, called it a wise strategy. ``She is 
differentiating herself from the front-runner and attracting a 
coalition back to the GOP -- a coalition made up of women and 
mothers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three weeks after the Colorado high school shooting, Republican  
presidential candidates are staking out territory on guns and 
school violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Other than Bush and Dole, no GOP candidate supports further  
legislation to restrict access to guns. Typical of the rest of the 
field is Gary Bauer, the conservative activist who says the 
shootings are the result of deeper social problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush and Dole already have said they support the federal bans on  
assault weapons and armor-piercing bullets. Mrs. Dole unveiled 
those stances in a New Hampshire gathering of presidential 
hopefuls, drawing a cool reception from activists. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, as Texas governor, signed into law a measure allowing  
state residents to get a license to carry a concealed weapon; it 
requires training and a background check. 
</P>
<P>
	``Governor Bush has a record of doing in office what he says he  
will do on the campaign trail,'' spokeswoman Karen Hughes said, a 
subtle reference to the fact that Mrs. Dole has never held elective 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know many women and men in Texas who have gone through the  
training and who have a license and who feel safer because of that 
legislation -- particularly women who travel or work late at 
night,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole's campaign believes there is growing support for her  
position on guns -- even among GOP voters -- and they are betting 
that she will get credit for taking a tough stand even if their 
polls are wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the right thing to do and I won't shy away from the tough  
issues, even if some in my party don't like it,'' Mrs. Dole said 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``That includes issues like allowing people to carry concealed  
weapons. While that's a matter for the states to decide, I think 
police work is hard enough already. No one should make it harder. I 
think it's wrong to let people carry concealed weapons,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She also announced her support of a mandatory requirement that  
guns be sold with child safety locks. Bush supports a voluntary 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Tuesday in Philadelphia, Mrs. Dole took a jab at the  
entertainment industry. She said TV and movie executives should 
take into account the effect of sex and violence on young minds. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Hollywood folks have got to realize with their First  
Amendment rights come responsibilities in terms of what is 
presented to our children, because kids tend to emulate what they 
see,'' the Republican presidential candidate told reporters after a 
speech to 1,500 people at the 15th annual Philadelphia Leadership 
Prayer Breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's far too much violence and casual sex and all the rest  
today,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Dole was a frequent critic of the entertainment industry  
during the 1996 campaign.

<HEADLINE> Court Rejects Kiryas Joel District </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The third attempt by the Legislature and  
governor to create a special school district for disabled Jewish 
children is unconstitutional, New York state's highest court ruled 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Continuing a decade-long, unbroken string of judicial defeats  
for the special Kiryas Joel school district, the Court of Appeals 
ruled that the latest law ``has the primary effect of advancing one 
religion over others and constitutes an impermissible religious 
accommodation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, the court split 4-3, with the three dissenters saying  
the latest law, created in 1997 by the legislature and Gov. George 
Pataki, had removed the constitutional problems of earlier versions 
and was now acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiryas Joel is a community of ultra-Orthodox Jews in Orange  
County, about 45 miles northwest of New York City. In the late 
1980s, its leaders first asked the legislature to create a special 
school district so its disabled children could be educated in their 
own schools rather than in the local school district. 
</P>
<P>
	The leaders of the religious community, considered a potent  
political force, said the children did better in a Hasidic setting. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the state School Boards Association attacked the  
district as an illegal accommodation for the benefit of the 
religious Kiryas Joel community and no others. Both the Court of 
Appeals and the U.S. Supreme Court agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1994 law re-establishing the district also was thrown out by  
the Court of Appeals, again citing the separation of religion and 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the latest law emphasized that under its  
provisions Kiryas Joel was not the only community that could 
establish a special school district. A district in neighboring 
Rockland County also could qualify, though it has chosen not to. 
</P>
<P>
	The majority of the Court of Appeals said Tuesday the third law  
remains too exclusive. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge George Bundy, who wrote the ruling, noted that a 1997 U.S.  
Supreme Court decision could provide a solution to the longstanding 
dispute. That decision said it was legal for school districts to 
send teachers into parochial schools to provide remedial education.

<HEADLINE> GM Launches $1B Olympic Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp. isn't letting the Salt Lake  
City Olympic scandal stand in the way of its $1 billion marketing 
campaign to link the world's leading sporting event and its No. 1 
automaker. 
</P>
<P>
	GM called on seven gold medalists Tuesday to help kick off its  
sponsorship program for the U.S. Olympic Committee and its 
constituent sports governing bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	Figure skaters Dorothy Hamill and Kristi Yamaguchi, track stars  
Carl Lewis, Evelyn Ashford and Bob Mathias, swimmer Pablo Morales 
and basketball player Grant Hill will help GM and the United Auto 
Workers aid families of U.S. Olympic hopefuls. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Olympics have taken some shots of late. Some of those  
shots are deserved,'' NBC sportscaster Bob Costas said a news 
conference Tuesday. ``But what endures about the Olympics is the 
athletes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GM will launch 17 months of ads for the 2000 Summer Games during  
next month's NBA Finals, GM vice president and marketing chief Phil 
Guarascio said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing quite captures center stage like the Olympics,''  
Guarascio said. The early ad launch is a way of ``avoiding the 
Olympic clutter with other sponsors -- be there where they ain't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's also a good business deal. GM gets exclusive rights to use  
U.S. Olympic symbols and athletes in its ads for the next five 
Olympics -- through 2008. 
</P>
<P>
	GM pulled out all stops at a news conference to show its  
continued confidence -- and investment -- in the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to bringing in six Olympic gold medalists -- Hill was  
absent because of his Detroit Pistons' NBA playoff series with 
Atlanta -- it hired Costas as master of ceremonies. NBC holds the 
U.S. Olympic TV rights through 2008. 
</P>
<P>
	Costas said those who strive to be the world's best before a  
worldwide audience of billions make a lasting impression ``no 
matter how much bungling people in suits are guilty of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ten International Olympic Committee members have resigned or  
been expelled in the scandal over favors and payments to win the 
2002 Winter Games for Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson &AMP; Johnson broke off U.S. Olympic sponsorship  
negotiations after the scandal broke, and other business interest 
has slackened. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly it slowed down the sale of our sponsorships,'' said  
John Krimsky, the U.S. Olympic Committee's deputy secretary general 
and marketing chief. ``But I will tell you that we have put that 
behind us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NBC sports head Dick Ebersol denied the network has felt any  
heat from the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been pretty much untouched,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Certainly, GM's solid and substantial support -- much of it going  
to buy ad spots on NBC -- should go a long way to shore up U.S. 
corporate backing of the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's 10-year, $1 billion sponsorship agreement buys it rights as  
the official vehicle-maker to the U.S. team. It also will be the 
only domestic automaker advertising during NBC's 2000 Olympic 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	The rights extend to Olympic coverage on NBC's 13 network-owned  
and operated stations. 
</P>
<P>
	GM signed the contract more than a year ago, before the scandal  
broke, but had not decided how it would be spending its money. 
</P>
<P>
	While discussing the megadollars going toward its Olympic ad  
campaign, GM sought to spotlight a more modest program to supply 
cars and trucks to the families of Olympic contenders. 
</P>
<P>
	``Team Behind the Team'' is a $3.5 million joint project with  
the UAW, the automaker's principal union. 
</P>
<P>
	The program will give cars to the families of 100 U.S. athletes  
preparing for the 2000 Games in Sydney and another 100 for those 
aiming for Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven Olympic medalists, who will select the recipients,  
talked about the sacrifices their families made to aid their sports 
careers. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mother never got that carpet for the living room,'' said  
Lewis, winner of nine track-and-field gold medals in the 1988, '92 
and '96 games. ``The money went to send us to track meets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My parents spent a lot of time away from the rest of the  
family,'' said Yamaguchi, 1992 figure-skating gold medalist. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamill said her mother fed her breakfast in bed, then  
chauffeured her on two daily 2 1/2-hour round trips from their 
Connecticut home to an ice rink in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``I received all the glory, but my family and coach worked just  
as hard,'' the 1976 figure-skating gold medalist said.

<HEADLINE> Purdue's Keady Gets New Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) -- Gene Keady, the winningest coach in  
Purdue basketball history, signed a one-year contract extension 
that will increase his base salary to $185,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced Monday extends Keady's current contract  
through the 2002-03. His total compensation package is believed to 
be at least $350,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	That puts him among the top 10 percent of college coaches in the  
nation in compensation, Purdue athletic director Morgan Burke said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This new agreement will allow Gene to build on the success he  
has had at Purdue and we are very pleased to have his continued 
leadership of our men's basketball program,'' Burke said. ``His 
enthusiasm for the program and his interest in the young men on his 
team are an inspiration to us all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Keady, who will start his 20th season with the Boilermakers in  
the fall, has a record of 415-181 at Purdue. His teams have made 15 
NCAA tournament appearances, advancing to the regional semifinals 
four times, including each of the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boilermakers will return three starters from the 1998-99  
team.

<HEADLINE>  West Considers Future With Lakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- In what has become an annual rite of  
spring around these parts, Jerry West addressed speculation his 
lengthy front-office career with the Los Angeles Lakers may be 
nearing an end. 
</P>
<P>
	West, who turns 61 later this month, told NBC Sunday he wouldn't  
be holding his job of executive vice president with the Lakers much 
longer. 
</P>
<P>
	In a rare interview session, West said Tuesday he didn't know if  
he would complete the four-year contract extension he signed last 
September, a deal that runs through the 2002-2003 season and 
reportedly is worth $3.5 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been an incredible love for me. To even think about  
walking away from it, that's very painful,'' West said. ``I have 
made some promises to Shaquille O'Neal. He's like family to me. the 
most important thing is to have enthusiasm for this job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will have a conversation with Jerry ((Lakers owner Jerry  
Buss) at the end of the season and talk about what's best for the 
Lakers and what's best for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal, who signed a six-year contract with the Lakers in 1996  
and is finishing his third season with the team, could exercise a 
clause allowing him to become a free agent this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him I'd be here,'' West said. ``He made a commitment to  
us. I really want to see us win a championship with him here. I 
really believe he's going to retire as an LA player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal said Monday there was ``a 97 percent chance I'll be back  
here next year. But I'm not even thinking about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles led Houston 1-0 in their best-of-5 first-round  
series heading into Tuesday night's game. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked about recent speculation that he might take a  
front-office job with the New York Knicks, West smiled and said, 
``Fellas, I'm not going anywhere. I'm going to live in Los Angeles. 
I'm not looking for another job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	West starred for the Lakers for 14 seasons before retiring in  
1974. He later coached the team for three years, and has been in 
charge of the club's basketball operations for 17 years, the 
longest tenure in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	As he did last year, West said his relationship with Buss was  
solid even though the two disagreed at times. 
</P>
<P>
	``This guy's been so great to me,'' West said. ``I can't tell  
you how great he's been. When I read about a deteriorating 
relationship, that really bothers me. He's really been a committed 
owner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the disagreements between West and Buss came over the  
signing of Dennis Rodman, who joined the Lakers in late February 
and was waived seven weeks later after several incidents. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really like Dennis,'' West said. ``There's nothing wrong  
with Dennis, he's a nice guy. I didn't think he was a good fit. It 
put a terrible burden on Kurt (Rambis) as a coach. I didn't think 
it was a good fit for (Rodman).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rambis was hired to succeed Del Harris on the same day Rodman  
played in his first game for the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I pretty much say to Jerry what I think,'' West said of the  
owner. ``It is his team. He wants to win a championship. He thought 
it would bring us a step closer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the 30-minute interview session ended, West wanted addressed  
recent reports he had taken a lower profile. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hadn't disappeared,'' he said. ``I've always been here.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Trains Sites on Gore Rival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican Party, citing internal polls  
that suggest Vice President Al Gore is vulnerable in the Democratic 
primary, is turning its attention to Gore rival Bill Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	A memo written by David Israelite, the Republican National  
Committee's director of political and governmental affairs, says 
Gore's poll numbers are down and Bradley's are up. The memo to RNC 
chairman Jim Nicholson also says Gore's unfavorable rating ``is at 
a high 23 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on this most recent confirmation of what our earlier  
research has indicated, I have directed our research department to 
shift its focus to Bill Bradley a full 50 percent of the time. We 
will continue to monitor the situation,'' Israelite wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``Agreed,'' Nicholson said in a handwritten reply. ``Do it!''  
</P>
<P>
	A copy of the May 4 memo was obtained Monday by The Associated  
Press. 
</P>
<P>
	With Gore the early favorite to win the Democratic nomination,  
Republicans are eager to portray him as a weak candidate. The memo 
may be part of that strategy, but it also reflects the results of 
some public opinion polls that showed a shrinking gap between Gore 
and Bradley, a former New Jersey senator. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Gore holds a lead of 20 or more percentage points in most  
polls, and at least one public survey suggests that the vice 
president has regained some of the lost ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's campaign dismissed the memo.  
</P>
<P>
	``This must be the RNC's version of trickle down negative  
politics,'' spokesman Roger Salazar said. ``It's too bad they can't 
spend some of those resources coming up with good policy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whether genuinely concerned or not about Bradley's chances, the  
RNC is starting to treat Bradley as a serious candidate: The 
party's spokesman attacked him Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without looking in depth yet, I would say the fact that Bill  
Bradley's biggest accomplishment in the Senate was losing the fight 
against welfare reform is significant,'' said RNC communications 
director Cliff May. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley has expressed concern about the impact welfare reform  
has on poor Americans. Gore supported President Clinton's decision 
to sign the 1996 welfare overhaul bill. 
</P>
<P>
	May also noted that Bradley voted against President Reagan's  
nomination of Alan Greenspan as Federal Reserve chairman. Greenspan 
is given high marks by Democrats and Republicans for his role in 
improving the nation's economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser said the former senator had  
questioned Greenspan's international experience during the first 
confirmation hearing, but voted for Greenspan when he was 
re-nominated. 
</P>
<P>
	``His worries have proven unfounded,'' Hauser said.  
</P>
<P>
	Even with GOP pollsters still in the field last month, RNC chief  
of staff Tom Cole predicted that the party would train its sites on 
Bradley. The Israelite memo put the new policy in motion.

<HEADLINE> Japan Economy May Be Set for Rebound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's economy may begin to expand in the next few  
months, according to a set of economic figures released Tuesday by 
the Economic Planning Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency's index of leading indicators, which is intended to  
forecast economic conditions in the next few months, rose to 62.5 
in March from 50.0 in February. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency considers a reading above 50 to indicate that the  
economy is setto expand in the short term and a level below 50 to 
herald contraction. 
</P>
<P>
	The index of coincident economic indicators, a measure of the  
current state of the economy, fell to 37.5 in March from 60.0 in 
February, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	The indexes compare the level of various economic indicators,  
such as production, inventory and jobs numbers, with their level 
three months earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The leading indices for January and February were revised upward  
by the agency to 50 from preliminary readings of 44.4.

<HEADLINE> Cannes Without U.S. Blockbusters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANNES, France (AP) -- There should be plenty of stars ambling  
along the famed boardwalk at Cannes this year. But a few others 
will be sorely missed. 
</P>
<P>
	Namely: Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker, Tom Cruise and Nicole  
Kidman. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the long-awaited new ``Star Wars'' movie nor ``Eyes Wide  
Shut,'' Stanley Kubrick's final film, will be on the bill when the 
52nd annual Film Festival kicks into gear on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Not for lack of trying. Festival head Gilles Jacob asked for  
both films, but was turned down -- a victim, he says, of Hollywood's 
desire to save its splashy openings for U.S. shores. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacob especially wanted ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' a tale of jealousy  
and sexual obsession starring real-life couple Cruise and Kidman, 
and he asked Kubrick about it before the director died in March. 
But the movie will open in the United States, on July 16. 
</P>
<P>
	As for ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' -- clearly  
the film event of the season, Cannes notwithstanding -- ``the 
producers feared it might make them lose viewers in the United 
States,'' Jacob told a French film magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't understand this attitude,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The film opens May 19, and you can bet the world of cinema will  
not be focusing on Cannes that day. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the four American entries in the main competition, only one,  
John Sayles' ``Limbo,'' is described as a big studio film. The love 
story set in Alaska stars David Straithairn and Mary Elizabeth 
Mastrantonio. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other films generating buzz:  
</P>
<P>
	--''The Cradle Will Rock'': Tim Robbins' film is about a  
left-wing theater company trying to stage an anti-capitalist play 
in 1937. It stars Susan Sarandon, John and Joan Cusack, John 
Turturro and Vanessa Redgrave. 
</P>
<P>
	--''Felicia's Journey'': Canadian Atom Egoyan, who directed the  
highly acclaimed ``The Sweet Hereafter,'' is back with a film about 
a 17-year-old girl's search for her real father. Bob Hoskins stars. 
</P>
<P>
	--''All About My Mother'': The always-interesting Spanish  
director Pedro Almodovar presents an offbeat tale about motherhood. 
</P>
<P>
	--''No One Writes to the Colonel'': Mexican Arturo Ripstein's  
film is based on a Gabriel Garcia Marquez novel about an 
impoverished colonel awaiting his pension. 
</P>
<P>
	-- ``The Emperor and the Assassin'': Chinese director Chen Kaige,  
of ``Farewell My Concubine'' fame, goes back to the year 300 B.C. 
to recount the birth of his country. Starring the famed Chinese 
actress Gong Li. 
</P>
<P>
	Also featured will be Israel's first entry in 25 years, and, out  
of competition, the first film from the tiny country of Bhutan. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the official selection lacks big-budget Hollywood  
productions, such fare will be available out of competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Howard's ``EDtv,'' not a big success in the United States,  
will be screened -- no doubt an effort to draw some needed overseas 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
	Films like ``EDtv'' have nothing to lose, because they already  
have opened back home. ``Primary Colors'' made a trip to Cannes for 
the same reasons last year. 
</P>
<P>
	But the producers of big-budget Hollywood films may have learned  
a sobering lesson about unveiling their movies at Cannes. Last 
year, parts of ``Armageddon'' were shown here to the foreign press, 
drawing derisive laughter -- clearly not what the filmmakers were 
aiming for.

<HEADLINE> White House Site Temporarily Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House Web site was taken off line  
after hackers reportedly angered by the NATO bombing of the Chinese 
Embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, broke into the system. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Barry Toiv confirmed that the site was  
shut down Monday evening for at least 24 hours after ``an attempt 
was made ... to break into the system that operates the White House 
Web page.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NBC News reported that the hackers were based in Hong Kong and  
that they left behind cyber graffitti critical of the ongoing NATO 
operation in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Toiv said he had no information on who the hackers were or what  
their motive might have been. A Secret Service public affairs 
officer did not return a request for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	After the hackers were detected, Toiv said, officials monitoring  
the Web site, which provides texts of President Clinton's speeches 
and other White House documents, decided to shut it down for 
review. The site was still down Tuesday night.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Move Higher; Dow Up 46.10 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Prices opened higher on Wall Street today,  
pushed up by retailers' strong earnings reports and buying in 
technology shares. 
</P>
<P>
	At 10 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 46.10 at 11,053.35. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the Dow average fell 24.34 to 11,007.25.  
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index was up 9.91 at 1,350.21, and the Nasdaq composite index was 
up 26.15 at 2,552.54. 
</P>
<P>
	Retail shares were led higher by Wal-Mart, up 1 3/4 at 46 15/16,  
after the company released an earnings report that beat Wall 
Street's profit forecast. Home Depot was up 3 1/8 at 59 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks were also higher in continued buying of  
Internet-related shares. AOL was up 9 5/8 at 137 15/16 in leading 
volume on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Concerns about higher interest rates were still prominent ahead  
of two big refundings by the Treasury today and Wednesday. The 
30-year Treasury bond yield was trading at 5.79 percent, even with 
Monday's close. Despite the interest rate concerns, banking stocks 
were higher with Citigroup up 1 1/16 at 72 3/8.

<HEADLINE> Cisco 3Q Profits Rise 33 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Quarterly profits rose 33 percent at Cisco  
Systems as the frenzied growth of Internet activity fueled a 44 
percent jump in revenues for the networking technology company. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisco earned $646 million, or 38 cents per share, in the three  
months ended May 1, the third quarter of the company's fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	In the same period last year, Cisco earned $484 million, or 30  
cents per share, excluding a one-time charge of $419 million to 
cover acquisition-related expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest results, released after financial markets closed on  
Tuesday, edged the 37 cents per share that Wall Street was 
expecting, according to a survey of analysts by First Call. 
</P>
<P>
	In advance of the report, Cisco's shares rose $2.62 1/2, or 2.4  
percent, to $111.87 1/2 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. But in late 
trading on other markets, the shares rose as high as $117. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues for the past three months totaled $3.15 billion, up  
sharply from $2.18 billion in year-ago period, thanks to robust 
growth in most business sectors and regions. 
</P>
<P>
	Equipment orders for cable TV systems and digital subscriber  
line networks -- the broadband connections that can combine 
Internet, telephone and TV service -- both improved more than 40 
percent in the latest quarter compared with to the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	Broadband is shaping up as a heated battlefield in the scramble  
for Internet market share, with AT&AMP;T assembling a national cable 
network and DSL prices falling as rival phone companies hurry to 
roll out that service. Last week, AT&AMP;T agreed to acquire MediaOne, 
the fourth largest cable company, and formed a partnership with No. 
3 Comcast. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisco's quarterly report also announced a stock split in which  
investors will receive two shares for every common share held on 
May 24. The split, the eighth since Cisco went public in 1990, will 
take effect on June 21. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet Economy continues to create unprecedented growth  
opportunities for people, companies, and countries on a global 
basis,'' said John Chambers, president and chief executive of 
Cisco. ``The new world of integrated data, voice, and video 
communications is at the center of these opportunities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cisco, based in San Jose, Calif., makes equipment for the  
Internet and other computer networks.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Spending Eats at Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress is about to take another bite out of  
the federal surplus, this time to pay for the conflict with 
Yugoslavia. With proposals mounting for other spending ideas, many 
Republicans worry that their image as a tightfisted party is in 
jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	As early as this week, congressional leaders hope to send  
President Clinton a bill financing the confrontation over Kosovo, a 
package expected to cost about $10 billion. Virtually all of it is 
sure to come from this year's federal surplus, which the 
Congressional Budget Office estimates will be a record $111 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem for Republicans is that all of that surplus will  
come from Social Security, which is collecting more money than it 
spends each year to prepare for the baby boomers' coming 
retirement. Republicans have pledged repeatedly to leave that money 
alone, in hopes of establishing themselves as protectors of the 
popular pension program. 
</P>
<P>
	But with Congress considering the Kosovo funds and a long list  
of other proposals -- such as beefing up spending for the Pentagon 
and schools -- the GOP is finding it increasingly tough to abide by 
its Social Security promise, blurring that message. 
</P>
<P>
	``Politically, the Republican Congress is creating a track  
record that can be used against them,'' warned Ron Utt, a senior 
fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	Some lawmakers want to add $1 billion to the Kosovo package for  
school safety and up to $4.3 billion for farmers. And that bill 
seems likely to be attached to another measure providing help for 
Central America for damage from last autumn's Hurricane Mitch and 
for U.S. farmers, to which senators have added hundreds of millions 
of dollars to aid the oil, hard-rock mining and steel industries. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of the year, lawmakers and Clinton may dip even  
deeper into surpluses for 1999 and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
	Both parties say they want to spend more to improve education,  
fortify the military and boost troops' pay. Democrats want to add 
prescription coverage to Medicare, and some want to roll back 
Medicare savings imposed two years ago on hospitals and other 
health-care providers. Republicans want a tax cut of about $800 
billion over the next decade, although they say none of it would be 
paid for from Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the Kosovo spending measure is not even the first chunk  
lawmakers have taken from the surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	When Congress and Clinton enacted a big package of ``emergency''  
spending last fall, it was financed through the surplus, and the 
nonpartisan CBO estimates it will trim this year's black ink by $17 
billion. Without it, the latest projection for the 1999 surplus 
would have been $128 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	That spending spree, however, upset many conservative voters,  
which Republicans say helped cause their poor showing in the 
November congressional elections. In reaction, many GOP leaders 
want to sharpen the party's conservative image by holding such 
raids on the surplus to a minimum. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of conservative senators led by Senate Majority Whip Don  
Nickles, R-Okla., have been pushing to keep the Kosovo package 
close to the $6 billion Clinton requested. Their worry is that the 
more money Congress adds to it, the less credibility their promise 
to protect Social Security has. 
</P>
<P>
	That was underlined when conservative Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla.,  
proposed paying for the Kosovo measure last week by cutting 
domestic programs across the board. He was defeated, 322-101, but 
not before highlighting his party's sensitivity to eroding Social 
Security's surpluses just weeks after Congress approved a 
GOP-written budget pledging to leave that money alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is morally right to support our troops'' but not ``to take  
money from the Social Security system, to take money out of the 
very future that we say is our highest priority,'' Coburn said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coburn proposal aimed a spotlight on a schism within the  
GOP, as more than half of the House Republicans voted against his 
amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	That split illustrated how little taste many Republicans have  
for the domestic spending cuts Coburn proposed, plus their belief 
that since Clinton also proposed paying for the fighting with the 
surplus, there would be scant political price to pay for doing just 
that. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can blame this one on Clinton without blinking hard,'' said  
Rich Galen, executive director of the Republican political action 
committee GOPAC.

<HEADLINE> Cezanne Still Life Sells for $60 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A Cezanne still life sold for $60.5 million, the  
fourth-highest price ever for a work of art sold at auction. 
</P>
<P>
	The painting, ``Still Life With Curtain, Pitcher and Bowl of  
Fruit,'' is ``as close to perfection as I have ever witnessed a 
work of art,'' Charles Moffett, a specialist in Impressionist and 
modern art for Sotheby's auction house, said after Monday's sale. 
</P>
<P>
	The work by Paul Cezanne, painted in 1893-1894, led a strong  
sale of artworks from the estate of Betsey Cushing Whitney, who 
died last year and was the widow of John Hay ``Jock'' Whitney, a 
financier, philanthropist and ambassador to Great Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	The price far exceeded Sotheby's estimate of up to $35 million.  
The previous record for a Cezanne sold at auction was $28.6 million 
in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	All 50 lots sold for a total of $128.3 million. The  
second-highest price was $35.2 million for Georges Seurat's ``The 
Isle of the Grand Jatte,'' a study for his 1884 masterpiece, 
``Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grand Jatte.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The price for the Seurat was several times the previous auction  
record for the artist, $2.7 million for ``The Channel of Grave 
Lines: Little Fort Philippe'' in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Diana Brooks, the president of Sotheby's North America, said,  
``It's rare in one's lifetime that we are able to be privileged 
enough to work with a collection of this caliber.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sale also included two Picassos formerly in the collection  
of Gertrude Stein: ``Still Life With a Bottle of Rum,'' which sold 
for $7.9 million, and ``The Journal,'' which sold for $6.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	All buyers were anonymous, and the prices include the auction  
house's commission of 15 percent of the hammer price up to $50,000 
and 10 percent of the total in excess of that amount. 
</P>
<P>
	The highest price ever paid for a painting at auction was $82.5  
million for van Gogh's ``Portrait of Dr. Gachet,'' sold during the 
height of the art boom in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	The second-highest price was $78.1 million for Renoir's ``At the  
Moulin de la Galette,'' also in 1990. The painting was also from 
the Whitneys' collection. The third-highest price was $71.5 million 
for a van Gogh self-portrait that sold last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Whitney died in March 1998 at age 89. Whitney died in 1982.

<HEADLINE> Black Medical Issues To Be Studied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUSKEGEE, Ala. (AP) -- A new bioethics center focusing on medical  
issues for minorities is opening in the town where black men with 
syphilis went untreated for 40 years as part of a notorious 
government study. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tuskegee University National Center for Bioethics in  
Research and Health Care opens on Saturday. Survivors of the 
Tuskegee experiments, ranging in age from 89 to 109, will be on 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect for the first time to be training and educating  
significant numbers of African-Americans as bioethicists -- 
something we don't have now,'' said Benjamin Payton, the university 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	The center was helped by a $200,000 grant President Clinton  
announced in 1997, when he apologized on behalf of the government 
for the syphilis study. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1930s, the federal Public Health Service lured black  
subjects in Tuskegee with the promise of free health care. A total 
of 399 men were never told they had syphilis, and researchers 
carefully monitored how the disease claimed its victims. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time the study was exposed by The Associated Press in  
1972, 28 men had died of syphilis, 100 others were dead of 
complications, at least 40 wives had been infected and 19 children 
had contracted the disease at birth. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuskegee University, a historically black college known then as  
Tuskegee Institute, was not involved in the study.

<HEADLINE> Past Stars Join GM Olympic Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- As some corporations back away from the Olympics  
because of the Salt Lake scandal, General Motors called on seven 
gold medalists Tuesday to help kick off a $1 billion Olympic 
sponsorship. 
</P>
<P>
	Skaters Dorothy Hamill and Kristi Yamaguchi, track stars Carl  
Lewis, Evelyn Ashford and Bob Mathias, swimmer Pablo Morales and 
basketball player Grant Hill will help GM and the United Auto 
Workers aid families of U.S. Olympic hopefuls. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's No. 1 automaker will launch 17 months of ads for the  
2000 Summer Games during next month's NBA Finals, GM vice president 
and marketing chief Phil Guarascio said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing quite captures center stage like the Olympics,''  
Guarascio said. The early ad launch is a way of ``avoiding the 
Olympic clutter with other sponsors -- be there where they ain't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's also a good business deal. GM gets exclusive rights to use  
U.S. Olympic symbols and athletes in its ads for the next five 
Olympics -- through 2008. 
</P>
<P>
	GM pulled out all stops at a news conference to show its  
continued confidence -- and investment -- in the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to bringing in six Olympic gold medalists -- Hill was  
absent because of his Detroit Pistons' NBA playoff series with 
Atlanta -- it hired NBC sportscaster Bob Costas as master of 
ceremonies. NBC holds the U.S. Olympic TV rights through 2008. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Olympics have taken some shots of late. Some of those  
shots are deserved,'' Costas said. ``But what endures about the 
Olympics is the athletes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said those who strive to be the world's best before a  
worldwide audience of billions make a lasting impression ``no 
matter how much bungling people in suits are guilty of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ten International Olympic Committee members have resigned or  
been expelled in the scandal over favors and payments to win the 
2002 Winter Games for Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson &AMP; Johnson broke off U.S. Olympic sponsorship  
negotiations after the scandal broke, and other business interest 
has slackened. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly it slowed down the sale of our sponsorships,'' said  
John Krimsky, the U.S. Olympic Committee's deputy secretary general 
and marketing chief. ``But I will tell you that we have put that 
behind us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NBC sports head Dick Ebersol denied the network has felt any  
heat from the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been pretty much untouched,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Certainly, GM's solid and substantial support -- much of it going  
to buy ad spots on NBC -- should go a long way to shore up U.S. 
corporate backing of the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's 10-year, $1 billion sponsorship agreement buys it rights as  
the official vehicle-maker to the U.S. team. It also will be the 
only domestic automaker advertising during NBC's 2000 Olympic 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	The rights extend to Olympic coverage on NBC's 13 network-owned  
and operated stations. 
</P>
<P>
	GM signed the contract more than a year ago, before the scandal  
broke, but had not decided how it would be spending its money. 
</P>
<P>
	While discussing the megadollars going toward its Olympic ad  
campaign, GM sought to spotlight a more modest program to supply 
cars and trucks to the families of Olympic contenders. 
</P>
<P>
	``Team Behind the Team'' is a $3.5 million joint project with  
the UAW, the automaker's principal union. 
</P>
<P>
	The program will give cars to the families of 100 U.S. athletes  
preparing for the 2000 Games in Sydney and another 100 for those 
aiming for Salt Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven Olympic medalists, who will select the recipients,  
talked about the sacrifices their families made to aid their sports 
careers. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mother never got that carpet for the living room,'' said  
Lewis, winner of nine track-and-field gold medals in the 1988, '92 
and '96 games. ``The money went to send us to track meets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My parents spent a lot of time away from the rest of the  
family,'' said Yamaguchi, 1992 figure-skating gold medalist. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamill said her mother fed her breakfast in bed, then  
chauffeured her on two daily 2 1/2-hour round trips from their 
Connecticut home to an ice rink in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``I received all the glory, but my family and coach worked just  
as hard,'' the 1976 figure-skating gold medalist said.

<HEADLINE> Necco Wins Bid To Make Clark Bar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The country's oldest candy maker and producer  
of Necco Wafers is the new owner of Pittsburgh's signature Clark 
Bar and plans to move production of the candy to Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	New England Confectionery Co., beating out a handful of other  
bidders, agreed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court on Tuesday to pay $4.1 
million for the peanut butter crunch Clark Bar. The production line 
will be moved to Cambridge in the next month or so, leaving more 
than 100 people without jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clark trademark has a good reputation with consumers, Necco  
president Domenic M. Antonellis said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clark Bar will have its own place,'' Antonellis said.  
``Unfortunately, we're not going to keep it in Pittsburgh.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 152-year-old candy maker, the oldest in the United States  
and also maker of Stark candies, also purchased Clark's recipe for 
Slim Fast diet candy bars and some inventory. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clark Bar will keep company with Necco's Sweethearts  
Conversation Hearts and its wafers, which are stamped out by 
century-old machines. Conversation Hearts -- those little pastel 
candies with messages like ``Be Mine'' -- were developed by Necco in 
1902. The company makes about 85 percent of those purchased each 
Valentine's Day, Antonellis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Irish immigrant D.L. Clark founded the Clark Bar in 1886, but in  
recent years the company has fallen on hard times, dwarfed by large 
national brands such as Mars and Hershey. The company has been 
operating under protection from its creditors since March and owes 
$6.6 million.

<HEADLINE> Jackson Fined in Plagiarism Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Michael Jackson, in composing his song ``Will You Be  
There,'' plagiarized an Italian songwriter, an Italian judge ruled 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Mario Frigenti immediately suspended a $2,200 fine but  
ordered the American pop star to pay court costs, which are likely 
to be considerable because the case has taken years to progress 
through the Italian court system, Italian state TV reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial began in 1995, two years after Al Bano, a veteran  
songwriter and singer, claimed Jackson stole part of the musical 
motif of his song ``I Cigni di Balaka,'' or ``The swans of 
Balaka,'' produced in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson's ``Dangerous'' album, which includes ``Will You Be  
There,'' dates to 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Jackson's lawyers, Alberto Seganti, said he will appeal.  
``There is no proof of plagiarism,'' the Italian news agency ANSA 
quoted Seganti as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	After the verdict was announced, a beaming Al Bano, whose real  
name is Albano Carrisi, invited Jackson to perform a concert with 
him and donate the proceeds to children from Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	In a hearing in Rome two years ago, Jackson told the court there  
was some similarity between the two songs ``but it's completely 
coincidental.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The court had heard an analysis done by an expert who found that  
37 notes were the same in each song. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate, civil lawsuit, Jackson's lawyers last year  
announced that the Italian singer had lost a copyright infringment 
case against their client and was ordered to pay expenses. The 
trial that ended Tuesday was a criminal case. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, Jackson has been cleared of plagiarism allegations  
in the United States involving ``Dangerous'' and ``Thriller'' 
albums.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Saying American businesses must invest in  
markets at home as they do abroad, President Clinton is appealing 
to the nation's chief executives to join the effort to breathe new 
life into cities and rural areas missing out on the current 
economic boom. 
</P>
<P>
	The president was convening a meeting today at the White House  
with 15 business leaders to discuss ways to bolster private 
investment in economically distressed communities. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Clinton was traveling to Atlanta for more discussions  
with CEOs and a tour of the Sweet Auburn Market, located near the 
Martin Luther King Jr. historic district, to see an example of the 
type of economic development he hopes to generate in other areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was to tout again his New Markets Initiative, a package  
of proposed tax incentives and loan guarantees designed to attract 
venture capital to areas in need of economic stimulus, such as 
Gary, Ind., the Los Angeles barrios and Appalachian hamlets. 
</P>
<P>
	He also was announcing plans to lead a delegation of CEOs and  
members of Congress on a tour of ``untapped markets'' the week of 
July 5. The White House said the trip was to be patterned after 
trade missions that Cabinet secretaries make overseas to identify 
markets where new jobs and development can be created. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president has been concerned, has spent a good bit of time  
over the last three years trying to come to grips with the 
problem,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Monday. ``Even 
though we have an economy that we haven't seen in a lifetime, if 
ever, in our country, there still are some areas of the country 
that haven't fully participated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president's New Markets plan was developed by an  
administration task force that consulted with investment advisers, 
members of Congress and pioneers in community development. Clinton 
first unveiled it in January at Jesse Jackson's Wall Street 
Project, a coalition of executives seeking to expand business 
opportunities for minorities and women, and included it as part of 
his fiscal 2000 budget proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Jackson's group played a prominent role in developing  
the proposal, Jackson himself was absent from today's events. 
</P>
<P>
	He was not listed among those meeting with Clinton at the White  
House, and was not invited to accompany the president to Atlanta. 
The head of the Wall Street Project, Sloan Financial Group CEO 
Maceo Sloan, was attending the White House meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's proposal includes:  
</P>
<P>
	--A $1 billion tax credit designed to spur $6 billion in new  
equity capital for investment in the targeted markets. The 
administration hopes the 25 percent credit will attract investors, 
who in turn could support small technology companies, inner-city 
shopping centers, manufacturers, retail stores and other 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	--Creation of new private investment partnerships to be known as  
America's Private Investment Companies patterned after the Overseas 
Private Investment Corp. APIC would make equity investments in 
larger businesses that expand or relocate to inner cities or rural 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
	--Targeting of the federal Small Business Investment Program to  
low- and moderate-income areas. This program provides equity and 
debt financing to small companies that are looking to grow. America 
Online and Staples are two examples of companies that have 
benefited from this program, but the White House says it has been 
of little benefit to inner cities and rural areas.

<HEADLINE> Panel Holds Cop Brutality Hearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. James Clyburn pledges that the  
Congressional Black Caucus' first hearing on police brutality will 
yield more than a report that will sit on a bookshelf and collect 
dust. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are focused on solutions,'' Clyburn, D-S.C., said Monday.  
``Panels like this often focus only on the horror stories, but we 
are talking solutions. We need to stay focused and achieve some 
meaningful results.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The caucus on Monday hosted the first of a planned national  
series of hearings on police brutality designed to measure whether 
the recent spate of high-profile deaths of young blacks at the 
hands of police are an aberration or a troubling new outgrowth of 
tougher policing policies nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Early in the five-hour hearing, the panel heard from  
representatives of the civil rights community, including National 
Urban League President Hugh Price and Raul Yzaguirre, president of 
the National Council of La Raza. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem isn't only excessive use of force but dragnet  
techniques'' that include racial profiling of suspects on traffic 
stops and the random stopping and frisking policies employed by New 
York City police, Price said. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Bill Lann Lee, acting assistant attorney general for  
civil rights, told the caucus members that although his office is 
limited in its ability to bring federal prosecutions in local 
police jurisdictions, it has reached settlements with the cities of 
Pittsburgh and Steubenville, Ohio, which were judged by the Justice 
Department to discriminate in policing. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee said investigations of the Washington, New York City and New  
Orleans police departments are continuing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have seen several tragedies in the last few months,'' Lee  
said. ``We have to see how we as a nation as a whole respond, not 
by pointing fingers but by moving forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses like Dorothy Elliott provided tearful testimony of how  
their loved ones died at the hands of police. Mrs. Elliott's son, 
Archie Elliott III, 24, was stopped by Prince George's County, Md., 
police in June 1995 for driving erratically. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Elliott, with his hands cuffed behind him in a  
police car, pointed a gun at them. The official version of events 
was that after refusing police orders to drop the gun, Elliott was 
shot 14 times and died. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can call it a tragedy, but I call it a murder,'' Mrs.  
Elliott sobbed. ``My son didn't resist arrest. My son's life had 
value.'' The shooting was ruled justified by authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Seated next to her was Saiko Diallo, whose son Amadou, a street  
vendor from Guinea, was killed Feb. 4 outside his apartment in the 
New York City borough of the Bronx when four white police officers 
fired 41 shots, striking him 19 times and making the young 
immigrant a national symbol of police abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	``The police officers have been indicted for (second-degree)  
murder,'' Diallo said in halting tones. ``But they are still 
working full time with a full salary. This is unfair. This is not 
right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clyburn said additional hearings are planned for New York, Los  
Angeles, Houston, Chicago and Atlanta.

<HEADLINE> Star Wars Tickets Available </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- For Javier Sanchez, it was fate as much as  
the Force that led him to the long line of devotees camping outside 
Mann's Chinese Theatre to get tickets to ``Star Wars: Episode I -- 
The Phantom Menace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A week ago, the 15-year-old Hollywood High School student and  
longtime ``Star Wars'' enthusiast happened to see the cluster of 
diehard fans outside the famous movie house. 
</P>
<P>
	``I decided I wanted to be out here with them,'' said Sanchez,  
whose love of ``Star Wars'' began at age 9 ``when I heard about 
Darth Vader getting his hand chopped off by Luke Skywalker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanchez and others who have been trading shifts outside the  
theater will get their chance to buy tickets today when advance 
sales for ``Phantom Menace'' begin at 3 p.m. EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	Theater operators and independent ticket sellers were gearing up  
for an expected onslaught of thousands of fans seeking tickets at 
theater box offices, over the Internet and by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	MovieFone, the company that sells tickets over the telephone and  
Internet, boosted its Web capacity to enable 10 times more people 
than usual to use the service. The company also increased its 
telephone capacity by 30 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this case, everyone's going to start coming after tickets  
at the same point in time,'' said Andrew Jarecki, chief executive 
officer of MovieFone. ``That presents a challenge to us, but it's 
one we think we can handle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Loews, Mann Theatres and Edwards Cinemas were among the theater  
operators planning to sell in advance by telephone or at the box 
office at most theaters. They and other operators were updating 
their Web sites and information lines to advise customers where and 
when tickets would be available. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbus, Ga.-based Carmike Cinemas Inc., unlike other big  
chains, elected to stick with its policy of not selling tickets in 
advance and even had to shoo away one fan who set up camp outside a 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, Carmike was hoping the film would generate strong  
ticket sales to offset lackluster earnings in recent months, said 
Philip Smitley, a spokesman for the company that as of March 31 
operated 2,653 screens at 463 locations in 36 states. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be one of the fastest-grossing movies of all  
time,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Phantom Menace'' doesn't actually open until May 19. But  
diehard fans have been camping outside Southern California theaters 
for weeks with friends to ensure they're among the first to see the 
long-awaited prequel to George Lucas' ``Star Wars'' trilogy. 
</P>
<P>
	Regal Cinemas, the world's largest movie chain, reported people  
lined up Tuesday outside theaters in San Antonio, Las Vegas, 
Cleveland, Philadelphia and Portland, Ore. Regal is showing Star 
Wars at 260 of its 411 theaters. 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Zacharetti, a vice president of the chain based in  
Knoxville, Tenn,. said he's seen nothing to compare with this. Not 
even ``Titanic'' had this level of expectation. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has not been anything with the built-in fan base,'' he  
said. ``Most films don't have the hype until after they open. But 
this has a 22-year history'' since the ``Star Wars'' original. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is basically part of our culture now.''  
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's sale won't end the vigil for some. Sanchez plans to  
stay in line as part of a promotion by Countingdown.com, a Web site 
dedicated to big movie openings. If he accumulates enough hours, he 
can win good seats inside Mann's. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Tuesday afternoon, the line holding hundreds of fans  
stretched half a block down Hollywood Boulevard and continued up 
Orange Street. 
</P>
<P>
	``'Star Wars' has changed my life,'' said Lance Swartout, 19,  
who had been pulling shifts with friends outside Mann's since April 
9. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ever since I was a kid I wanted to have the 'Star Wars' toys  
and make them, so I'm going to school to learn to make them,'' said 
Swartout, a toy design major at Otis College of Art and Design. 
``That's my dream. This makes it more fun. It's worth it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some theater operators were standing in line, too. Studio  
executives on Tuesday still were negotiating sales with some 
chains, said Tom Sherak, head of 20th Century's domestic film 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue for most, Sherak said, were stipulations that the movie  
remain in theaters for a set period of time, ranging from two weeks 
to 12 weeks, depending on the location and time of opening. 
</P>
<P>
	Sherak expected ``Star Wars'' to open initially on 2,800 to  
3,000 screens nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole difference in this movie is who has control of the  
movie playing at the theater,'' he said. ``The good news is I don't 
know of one exhibitor who doesn't want to play this movie and it's 
always easier when they want to play the movie.''

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- You can buy the toys, hear the music,  
speculate about the plot, download the trailer, and starting 
Wednesday, you can even buy tickets for ``Star Wars: Episode I -- 
The Phantom Menace,'' a movie premiere still a week away. 
</P>
<P>
	For fans, distributor 20th Century Fox and theater operators,  
the start of advance ticket sales at 3 p.m. EDT Wednesday is an 
event nearly as big as the movie itself.

</P>
<P>
	Weeks of hype and buildup can only carry a film for a few days.  
</P>
<P>
	Once it opens, Sherak said ``Phantom Menace'' will have to  
convince viewers it is worth the price of a ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	Early reviews of the movie have been mixed. Critics generally  
have praised the film for its visually stunning creation of a new 
universe of characters and creatures. Some have been less 
enthusiastic about the dialogue and story line, however. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have all the confidence in the world in the movie. The  
bottom line in any movie is the movie. It's what the public does,'' 
Sherak said. ``They're going to tell us how good that movie is and 
whether they're going to like it or not.''

<HEADLINE> Drumstick Maker Doing Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWPORT, Maine (AP) -- Vic Firth seems like a happy-go-lucky guy  
as he taps away with a pair of drumsticks on stair railings, tables 
or any other surface that presents itself during a stroll through 
his factory. 
</P>
<P>
	If he seems happy, the tympanist with the Boston Symphony  
Orchestra has good reason. He started making drumsticks for his 
students 35 years ago; now he has a factory that churns out 80,000 
pairs a week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made them for myself, then people started asking for them,''  
he said. ``I never envisioned anything of this magnitude.'' 
</P>
<P>
	These are the salad days for manufacturers of musical  
instruments as a booming economy coincides with growth in the 
school music market due in part to the ``echo'' of the baby boom 
generation. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite market pressures that lowered prices, musical instrument  
revenues have nearly doubled since 1990, from $3.8 billion to $6.4 
billion, according to Music Trades, an industry publication. 
</P>
<P>
	Gains have been almost across the board, from clarinets to  
guitars to professional sound reinforcement equipment, said Paul 
Majeski, publisher of the New Jersey-based trade journal. Consumers 
have benefited as competition and economic turmoil in Asia where 
many instruments are made have combined to drive prices down, 
Majeski said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the trend toward offshore production, Vic Firth  
continues to make his drumsticks in the United States. For 
starters, the wood for his sticks come from maple trees in Maine 
and hickory trees from Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Firth's roots are firmly planted in New England.  
</P>
<P>
	The Sanford native has been the tympanist for the Boston  
Symphony since 1952. Back then, he was dissatisfied with the warped 
utensils that passed for drumsticks, so he started making his own. 
</P>
<P>
	His first order for tympani mallets came from a musician with  
the Harvard-Radcliffe orchestra. ``I think I got $5, and it took me 
three weeks to make them,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	His students at the New England Conservatory learned of the  
sticks and started asking for them. 
</P>
<P>
	Firth hired a Canadian woodworker to handcraft the sticks he had  
designed in lots of 25 at a time. He took the finished product and 
burned his name on them by hand. 
</P>
<P>
	These days, production takes place at a 65,000-square-foot plant  
in Newport that he rescued from bankruptcy and now employs 97 
people. Here, wood is dried in kilns to reduce moisture and reduce 
warping before being ground down into sticks, and nonmusical items 
like pepper mills. 
</P>
<P>
	Quality control standards are high for 200 models of sticks,  
brushes and mallets. Firth, 68, jokes that any stick with 
imperfections ends up in his fireplace. 
</P>
<P>
	Sticks that pass muster are sorted by weight and then tested for  
pitch, density, flex and moisture content using a computer that 
ensures they're matched perfectly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I bet no drummer out there knows how much that stick goes  
through to make it to them,'' said Carole Norton, who is part of a 
team that stamps Firth's name on 13,500 sticks a shift. 
</P>
<P>
	Most workers, like Norton, don't know a paradiddle from a  
ratamacue. But the 26 rudiments of drumming are not a prerequisite 
for making sticks. 
</P>
<P>
	They leave the drumming to Firth, whose reputation is the  
foundation for his company's success. It's something unique in the 
music industry along the lines of having slow hand Eric Clapton own 
a guitar factory, Majeski said. 
</P>
<P>
	Firth's sticks have captured 40 percent of a market in which  
there are a dozen competitors, including Pro-Mark, Zildjian and 
Regal Tip. Annual sales are about $10.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Firth is in an enviable position because his product, like  
guitar strings, is not affected by the ups and downs of the 
economy. A drummer can delay buying a new drum kit and a guitarist 
can delay buying a new guitar, but they must replace broken sticks 
and strings. Firth's sticks carry a list price of about $10.50 a 
pair. 
</P>
<P>
	``Drumsticks are much like razor blades. You got to constantly  
replace them,'' said Majeski. ``So for a company like Vic Firth, 
it's a wonderful business. If you convince them about your product, 
you have a customer for life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Firth, who shuttles back and forth between his company's  
headquarters in Dedham, Mass., his plant in Newport and rehearsals 
at Symphony Hall in Boston, doesn't take his company's success for 
granted. 
</P>
<P>
	Growth depends on getting youngsters hooked on drumming. So  
Firth started a program that targets instructors with free books, 
teaching materials and, of course, drumsticks. He also makes 
starter kits for youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
	Firth admits that musicians don't make the best business people.  
But if the product is well made, customer service is strong and 
consumers get a solid guarantee, then success can come ``even if 
you can't read an audit sheet,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Through it all, Firth's most important tenet is to have fun,  
whether it's making sticks, playing with the symphony, checking out 
drummers at jazz joints, or saying hello to stars like the Rolling 
Stones' Charlie Watts who endorse his product. 
</P>
<P>
	Firth traded some Boston Symphony compact discs for a Rolling  
Stones necktie from Watts, who was in Boston for a gig two weeks 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything I've ever done, if it wasn't fun, I didn't do it,''  
Firth said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Airlines Gets Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Germany's Lufthansa Airlines and a  
Middle Eastern aviation company have agreed to help rehabilitate 
ailing Philippine Airlines, President Joseph Estrada said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline's majority stockholder Lucio Tan has been  
negotiating with Lufthansa officials in Germany principally to help 
manage the Philippine flag carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	Philippine officials said an aviation company in the Middle East  
and an investment group in Singapore have also expressed interest 
in providing some of the $200 million in new capital that PAL 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
	Estrada said he was informed by Tan, who is to return from  
Germany later this week, that Lufthansa and the Middle Eastern 
company have agreed in principle to help PAL recover. Estrada did 
not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	In Frankfurt, Germany, Lufthansa said late today it won't take  
an equity stake in PAL, but will offer consulting services. 
</P>
<P>
	The $200 million capital infusion is a key element of a PAL  
rehabilitation plan that also calls for reducing the airline's 
fleet of 54 aircraft to 22 and its 8,000-member workforce to about 
3,000. 
</P>
<P>
	PAL's debt was largely incurred by an ambitious but ill-timed  
fleet modernization program. The carrier became unable to service 
its loans as a result of Asia's economic crisis and a debilitating 
pilots' strike. 
</P>
<P>
	Manila's corporate regulator, the Securities and Exchange  
Commission, set a June 4 deadline for the capital infusion. 
</P>
<P>
	PAL's recovery plan has been conditionally accepted by European  
credit agencies owed around 40 percent of the carrier's $2.2 
billion debt. It has also gotten support from a consortium of 11 
Philippine banks, owed around 10 percent of the total debt, and a 
number of smaller local and foreign creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan is likely to be approved later this month despite the  
objections of the U.S. Export-Import Bank, PAL's second-biggest 
creditor with 16 percent of its debt, SEC Chairman Perfecto Yasay 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Ex-Im bank withdrew its support for the plan last week  
after Tan reassumed direct management control. 
</P>
<P>
	Tan stepped aside only a few months earlier under pressure from  
creditors who wanted PAL run by professional managers. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Philippine law doesn't require the SEC to get the  
consent of creditors for the rehabilitation plan, Yasay said this 
was necessary to ensure its success. 
</P>
<P>
	The backing of the U.S. Ex-Im Bank is also important because it  
recently began moves to seize all four of PAL's Boeing 747-400 
jets, which are used for its long-distance flights to the United 
States.

<HEADLINE> Hasek Is Key to Sabres Hopes / Hockey Game Story  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- The Buffalo Sabres and Boston Bruins are  
talking about hitting in their best-of-7 Eastern Conference 
semifinal series. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's really about goaltending.  
</P>
<P>
	Boston's Byron Dafoe is tough. Buffalo's Dominik Hasek, the  
NHL's two-time defending MVP, is still the man to beat. 
</P>
<P>
	The quarreling rivals switch to Buffalo for Games 3 and 4  
Wednesday and Friday. No matter how much his Buffalo teammates and 
their Boston foes might quarrel on and off the ice, Hasek stays 
focused on one thing -- stopping the puck. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to get into a fight, but I want the referee to  
see that I'm really upset if somebody takes a cheap shot at me, 
especially after the whistle,'' Hasek said. ``I just make a couple 
steps and let my teammates do their job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres took good care of Hasek for most of Game 2, pestering  
the Boston forwards in much the same way Buffalo captain Michael 
Peca and forward Vaclav Varada had rendered Ottawa superstar Alexei 
Yashin scoreless in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Boston hasn't played their best game yet,'' Hasek  
said. ``They'll be sharp in the next game. If we want to win, we'll 
have to be sharp, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year Hasek overcame a nagging groin injury, a sagging  
Buffalo offense and a trade rumor that flew into town just in time 
for the second round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The 34-year-old goaltender had a career-best 1.87 goals-against  
average. He led the NHL for the sixth straight year in save 
percentage at .937 and is one playoff shutout away from a team 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	In the playoffs' first round, Hasek shut Ottawa down. He  
preserved a 2-0 lead late in the second period of Game 2 against 
Boston by turning back a flurry of shots during a Bruins' 5-on-3 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	Players on both teams talk about a big hit Sabres defenseman  
Alexei Zhitnik made on Bruins captain Ray Bourque in Buffalo's 3-1 
victory in Game 2. That led to more talk about possible 
repercussions against Hasek, Buffalo's equivalent of Bourque. 
</P>
<P>
	``There isn't a whole lot you can do about someone running over  
Dom,'' Sabres defenseman Jason Woolley said. ``If they're trying to 
pick a superstar to go after, he's the only one. We know where 
they're going if that's their game plan, but I don't think we're 
worried about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek worries a lot more about the puck than the talk. ``I don't  
think about becoming a target of Boston players,'' he said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's best goaltender also knows that while he's watching  
out for shots, someone is watching his back. 
</P>
<P>
	``My defense does a good job in front of me and they will take  
care of the players who take runs at me,'' Hasek said. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston will try to distract Hasek and aim high. In Game 1, Hasek  
allowed three goals on 21 shots after a lengthy layoff following 
Buffalo's sweep of favored Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course we have to be ready for traffic in front,'' said  
Hasek, whose unorthodox style has him flopping around, throwing 
down his stick and frequently skating out of the crease. 
</P>
<P>
	``I expect there will be a couple of times when I won't see the  
puck, but it doesn't mean I can't stop the puck,'' Hasek said. 
``They talk about creating traffic in front of me and shooting 
high; it doesn't change my style.''

<HEADLINE> Farm Crisis Menaces S.D. Businesses / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANOVA, S.D. (AP) -- The waitress at Gene and Judy's Steakhouse  
and Lounge carries out a plate heaped with brown gravy, white bread 
and roast beef to a table of six men in plaid shirts. 
</P>
<P>
	Owner Gene Muth pauses from tending the grill in a tiny kitchen  
just off the bar to take a telephone call. Then he looks out over 
the dimly lit dining room. 
</P>
<P>
	Muth has seen larger lunch crowds.  
</P>
<P>
	But as farmers trimmed their spending to cope with depressed  
prices for grain and livestock, Muth, 54, is happy just to keep his 
doors open. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1972, when Muth first set up shop in Canova, the town has  
lost two grocery stores, two gas stations, its school, a meat 
locker and a laundromat. Most have closed since the farm crisis of 
the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	He once could count on a crowd of 20 to 30 people, even on a  
weeknight. Now he is lucky if three or four people come in for 
supper or drinks. Even Friday and Saturday nights -- which usually 
bring in enough money to cover a poor week -- have been slow. 
</P>
<P>
	``Weekends are terrible anymore,'' says Muth as he takes a break  
from tending the grill. ``With the farm economy, they aren't able 
to spend what they'd like.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A glance down Canova's two-block main street tells a story  
common to many small, rural towns that depend as much as farmers do 
on good prices for livestock and grain. 
</P>
<P>
	People still do business at the grain elevator and buy fuel at  
the gas station, but the community of about 170 is starting to look 
the worse for wear. Buildings are boarded up and abandoned, and the 
paint is peeling from many. 
</P>
<P>
	Even bigger communities like Howard, just up the road from  
Canova, are struggling, says Kent Terwilliger, owner of the Coast 
to Coast hardware store in Howard. 
</P>
<P>
	When he took over the business from a retired couple three years  
ago, he thought his prospects looked pretty good. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Terwilliger, 37, isn't so sure. Sales already are down from  
poor showings a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't taken a wage out of this store since I bought it,''  
says Terwilliger, who owns other businesses in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	As director of the South Dakota Association of Towns and  
Townships, Gail Brock is familiar with rural communities' 
struggles. Like others, she fears the current round of farm 
troubles will deliver another blow to small towns. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we see a decline in the farm industry, you will see  
(further) decline in some of those businesses in our small towns,'' 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
	Brock says small towns are hurt by several factors. People can  
easily drive to a larger town to shop, and farm families have a 
higher standard of living. 
</P>
<P>
	When she was growing up on a farm, ``We didn't expect to have  
the newest clothes. We sacrificed so we could have a new tractor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now farm children go to urban schools and want things ``that we  
never dreamed possible. They aren't willing to settle for a 
second-class life on the farm,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	The trend toward larger farms and corporate control hasn't  
helped either, says Brock. 
</P>
<P>
	Young farmers are asking themselves whether the fight is worth  
it, says Burton Pflueger, an Extension economist at South Dakota 
State University in Brookings. And increasingly, they are choosing 
options other than farming. 
</P>
<P>
	``As they do that self-examination, many find they can do as  
well and with less stress by relocating and working in the city,'' 
Pflueger says.

<HEADLINE> Angels' Leading Hitter Put on DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Tim Salmon, the Anaheim Angels' top  
hitter this season, will be sidelined at least another week with a 
sprained left wrist. 
</P>
<P>
	Salmon, who hurt his wrist diving for a fly ball on May 3, was  
placed on the 15-day disabled list Tuesday, retroactive to May 4. 
He will be eligible to come off the DL next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The right fielder is hitting .347, with a team-leading seven  
homers and 25 RBIs. He was selected the AL player of the week for 
April 12-18. 
</P>
<P>
	The Angels were in New York on Tuesday to begin a series against  
the Yankees. Salmon is scheduled to return to Anaheim on Wednesday 
for further evaluation by Dr. Lewis Yocum, the team doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the third time Salmon has been on the DL in his career. He  
was out with a foot injury from April 2 to May 9 last year, and 
missed July 18 to Aug. 3 of the 1994 season with a strained 
hamstring.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Higher; Dow Up 18.90 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A disappointing Treasury auction undercut a  
powerful rally in blue-chip stocks Tuesday, leaving them only 
modestly higher. But the broader market advanced unscathed on the 
strength of Internet stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average ended 18.90 higher at  
11,026.15, just shy of its record high close of 11,031.59 last 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators, however, maintained their strength.  
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 15.31 to 1,355.61, and the 
Nasdaq composite index rose 40.29 to 2,566.68. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow was up 94 points in early afternoon when the Treasury  
announced it had sold $15 billion of five-year notes at 5.367 
percent, an 11-month high, in the first leg of a two-day auction. 
</P>
<P>
	The news sent the 30-year Treasury bond, which was already down  
for the day, even lower. The bond's yield, which moves opposite the 
price, rose to 5.83 percent from 5.79 percent late Monday, making 
bond yields more competitive with stocks and sending equities 
prices tumbling. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is always the clear and present danger of the stock  
market,'' said Larry Wachtel, market analyst at Prudential 
Securities. ``Once bonds become an alternative form of investment, 
you set up a transfer from stocks to bonds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Big-company stocks, which are expensive relative to their  
projected earnings, are especially sensitive to inflation and 
higher rates. Either could cut into future earnings and send the 
stocks lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Smaller stocks, on the other hand, are cheap relative to future  
earnings. They can sustain a decline in the earnings projections 
without losing their price advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	Blue chips are particularly vulnerable now because they have  
risen so far so fast, Wachtel said. ``We're up 1,200 (Dow) points 
in five weeks. If you breathe heavily, this whole thing topples 
over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks could get hit again Wednesday when the Treasury auctions  
another $12 billion of securities, this time of 10-year notes, and 
again on Thursday and Friday, when the government releases 
wholesale and consumer price data. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Battipaglia, market strategist at Gruntal &AMP; Co., said he  
thought bond traders, not stock traders, were overdoing the 
selling. ``The data says that there's no inflation and the economy 
remains strong,'' Battipaglia said. ``Therefore, the bond market is 
wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Retail stocks were led higher by Wal-Mart, up 2 1/8 at 47 5/16,  
after the company released an earnings report that beat Wall Street 
forecasts. Home Depot was up up 2 7/8 at 59 1/4. Prudential Securities 
upgraded the stock after the company announced expansion plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks were also higher in continued buying of  
Internet-related issues. 
</P>
<P>
	America Online was up 13 1/8 at 141 7/16 and was the most active  
stock on the New York Stock Exchange after the company struck 
alliances with four television companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan Stanley analyst Mary Meeker upgraded AOL stock, saying  
the company should be able to stake out a leadership in the new 
multi-channel, high-speed communications arena while still find 
plenty of support for its traditional dial-up Internet service over 
the next several years. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet stocks were also boosted by a very strong inaugural for  
The Street.com, an Internet news service whose stock soared to 60 
1/16 from an original price of 19 in its first day of trading in 
the Nasdaq stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock and bond markets for the most part ignored a  
government report that the nation's productivity, a key gauge of 
future prosperity, shot up at an annual rate of 4 percent in the 
first three months of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange. Consolidated volume totaled 1.02 billion 
shares, up from Monday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 6.43 to 645.77, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 2.21 to 789.29. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies rose 4.96 to 446.81. 
</P>
<P>
	In foreign stock markets, the Nikkei average in Tokyo declined  
1.38 percent. In Europe, the DAX in Frankfurt rose 0.83 percent, 
the CAC in Paris gained 0.07 percent, and the FT-SE 100 index in 
London rose 0.46 percent.

<HEADLINE>  Netanyahu Campaign Targets Arafat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Slipping in the polls as a divisive electoral  
campaign enters its final days, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu has been taking his toughest shots at a man who isn't in 
the race: Yasser Arafat. 
</P>
<P>
	By casting the Palestinian leader as chief villain in the  
campaign drama, Netanyahu hopes to tar left-leaning opponent Ehud 
Barak by association, and build up support among his own hard-line 
constituency in advance of Monday's national elections. 
</P>
<P>
	From early political ads that personally targeted Arafat to a  
bid this week to shut down the PLO's Jerusalem headquarters, the 
prime minister has kept the Palestinian leader squarely in his 
sights throughout the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's running against Arafat -- he's using Arafat 24 hours a  
day,'' said Palestinian analyst Mahdi Abdel-Hadi, who heads a 
Jerusalem think tank. 
</P>
<P>
	Even those in the prime minister's camp acknowledge he has  
little to lose by letting friction with the Palestinians come into 
play. 
</P>
<P>
	``It can be said that the fact that Arafat is against Netanyahu  
can work for Netanyahu, because not everybody here is enamored'' of 
the Palestinian leader, said top Netanyahu aide David Bar-Illan. 
</P>
<P>
	Like much else about Israeli politics, the anti-Arafat strategy  
is far from subtle. 
</P>
<P>
	Netanyahu's first round of campaign ads portrayed a shadowy,  
sinister figure in the Palestinian leader's trademark kaffiyeh 
headdress counting down the days to a Barak victory. Another ad 
showed a fiery Arafat declaring that anyone who doesn't like the 
idea of a Palestinian state can go and ``drink from the sea off 
Gaza.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the prime minister hammered away at the theme that  
only his unyielding stance toward the Palestinians had prevented 
Arafat from declaring Palestinian statehood May 4, upon the 
expiration of interim peace accords. Palestinian leaders said the 
key consideration in the delay was a wish to avoid playing into 
Netanyahu's hands. 
</P>
<P>
	The Palestinians' prominence as a campaign theme has been  
something of a paradox. The five-month race has been virtually 
devoid of thoughtful discourse among the candidates about what 
would seem to be the overriding question facing Israel: terms of 
eventual Palestinian statehood. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Netanyahu has seized on issues with maximum visceral  
appeal. This week, he moved to close several Palestinian offices in 
the east Jerusalem compound known as Orient House. For the past 
eight years, Orient House has served as the Palestinians' de facto 
headquarters in the contested city. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel's Supreme Court on Tuesday stayed the closure order until  
after next week's vote, but the prime minister had already made his 
point: trumpeting Israel's claim to sovereignty over all Jerusalem, 
including the traditionally Arab eastern sector where Palestinians 
want to establish the capital of their future state. 
</P>
<P>
	So widespread is the perception that Netanyahu is deliberately  
courting confrontation with the Palestinians -- on the theory that 
heightened Israeli security fears would translate into votes for 
him -- that it was featured in a biting skit this week by the 
popular Israeli satirical puppet show Hartsufim. The show depicted 
the prime minister all but begging Arafat to give the green light 
to a suicide attack by Islamic militants. 
</P>
<P>
	That's only satire, but Netanyahu's own ads have harkened back  
to a series of grisly bus bombings in Israeli cities weeks before 
the 1996 vote in order to suggest that a dovish government means a 
vulnerable Israel. While the ads have been ridiculed in some 
circles as heavy-handed, the 1996 attacks were generally viewed as 
having propelled Netanyahu to his razor-thin victory in that race. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, Arafat has managed to stay out of the fray, steadfastly  
describing the elections as an internal Israeli affair. And he has 
been able to keep a lid on building street pressure in the West 
Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
	Palestinians are furious over a burst of Jewish settlement  
activity in recent weeks. Almost daily, settlers move new trailers 
onto rocky West Bank hilltops, seeking to expand existing 
settlements. 
</P>
<P>
	Settler leaders frankly acknowledge they are making a  
pre-election drive to establish ``facts on the ground'' -- populate 
more territory in order to make it harder for the Israeli 
government to cede it to the Palestinians later. 
</P>
<P>
	Such expansions, which Palestinians condemn as land grabs, would  
normally set off angry protests and clashes with Israeli troops. 
Instead, the West Bank and Gaza have been remarkably quiet in 
recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat does have one strong direct link to the Israeli vote: he  
exercises considerable influence over Israel's 1 million Arab 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	While he meticulously avoids any public electioneering among the  
Israeli Arabs, the Palestinian leadership has reportedly been 
deeply involved in back-channel discussions over whether the first 
Arab candidate for Israeli prime minister, Azmi Bishara, should 
drop out to improve Barak's chances for a first-round victory over 
Netanyahu. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Arafat and Bishara, who says he will make a decision on  
leaving the race by Saturday, deny such contacts. 
</P>
<P>
	Ordinary Palestinians, who follow the Israeli campaign with  
close attention -- and considerable sophistication -- say the most 
important thing they can do in coming days is to avoid responding 
to any Israeli provocations with violence. 
</P>
<P>
	In the dusty West Bank town of Bethlehem, storekeeper Omar Boja,  
seated among crates of fresh-laid eggs and boxes of yellow onions, 
said it was also crucial that Palestinians refrain from any 
appearance of wanting to influence the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to see the man who wants peace elected,'' Boja said,  
avoiding even mentioning Barak's name. ``But it's their election, 
their choice.''

	Such expansions, which Palestinians condemn as land grabs, would  
normally set off angry protests and clashes with Israeli troops. 
Instead, the West Bank and Gaza have been remarkably quiet in 
recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat does have one strong direct link to the Israeli vote: he  
exercises considerable influence over Israel's 1 million Arab 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	While he meticulously avoids any public electioneering among the  
Israeli Arabs, the Palestinian leadership has reportedly been 
deeply involved in back-channel discussions over whether the first 
Arab candidate for Israeli prime minister, Azmi Bishara, should 
drop out to improve Barak's chances for a first-round victory over 
Netanyahu. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Arafat and Bishara, who says he will make a decision on  
leaving the race by Saturday, deny such contacts. 
</P>
<P>
	Ordinary Palestinians, who follow the Israeli campaign with  
close attention -- and considerable sophistication -- say the most 
important thing they can do in coming days is to avoid responding 
to any Israeli provocations with violence. 
</P>
<P>
	In the dusty West Bank town of Bethlehem, storekeeper Omar Boja,  
seated among crates of fresh-laid eggs and boxes of yellow onions, 
said it was also crucial that Palestinians refrain from any 
appearance of wanting to influence the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to see the man who wants peace elected,'' Boja said,  
avoiding even mentioning Barak's name. ``But it's their election, 
their choice.''

<HEADLINE> Coelho Brings Stature to Gore Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tony Coelho will add stature, discipline and  
political firepower to Al Gore's slow-starting presidential effort, 
said Democratic officials, who dismissed questions about the new 
campaign chairman's fund-raising tactics and personal finances in 
the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Coelho, appointed to the post Tuesday, is an adroit political  
operator who served 10 years in Congress before leaving under a 
cloud of controversy in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	He will oversee Gore's campaign staff, his White House political  
shop and various outside consultants. The three factions did not 
always work well together, slowing down the decisionmaking process 
and exposing the team to internal strife. 
</P>
<P>
	``His political and private sector experience, his tireless  
energy and his devotion to public service will make a strong 
campaign even stronger,'' Gore said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Party officials said signs of weakness had begun to show in the  
Democratic front-runner's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``With three factions, you'll get petty jealousies and  
confusion. You've got to have a strong figure in the middle. He's a 
good choice,'' said Democratic consultant Ray Strother. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore leads his only Democratic rival, former Sen. Bill Bradley  
of New Jersey, by at least 20 percentage points in most public 
opinion polls. Bradley added three senior advisers to his campaign 
Tuesday: pollster Diane Feldman, consultant Jacques DeGraff and 
field director Robert Richman. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore has been prone to gaffes, and slow to respond to the  
miscues, as Bradley threatens to close the gap. Though more 
sure-footed in recent days, the vice president still trails GOP 
front-runner George W. Bush in head-to-head surveys. 
</P>
<P>
	Implied in the praise for Coelho's appointment were suggestions  
that Gore's team had lacked discipline and leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt said it's important for the  
campaign to ``have focus and direction. I think Tony is very well 
equipped to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rahm Emanuel, a former Clinton aide and longtime Coelho booster,  
said the Californian brings ``stature and savvy'' to the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Mickey Kantor, a former Clinton Cabinet member who served as  
Clinton-Gore campaign chairman in 1992, called Coelho's appointment 
``a very positive step. Tony is extremely disciplined and 
focused.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Coelho, Kantor joined the 1992 Clinton campaign at its  
beginning. And unlike Kantor, Coelho insists he will not join the 
administration if his candidate wins the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just doing this out of loyalty for Al,'' the 56-year-old  
investment banker said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	He brings some political baggage to the job.  
</P>
<P>
	--Coelho quit Congress amid an investigation into his personal  
finances. The Justice Department later closed the case without 
taking criminal action. No indictment means no wrongdoing, 
supporters say. ``Nothing was shown to be wrong,'' Gephardt said. 
</P>
<P>
	--In the early 1980s, he transformed the Democratic House  
campaign committee into a modern and powerful organization. He 
expanded the contributions of business political action committees 
and was the first committee chairman to accept ``soft money'' -- 
unregulated donations from unions, corporations and individuals 
that do not fall under federal limits. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say Coelho's record will be a constant reminder of  
Gore's aggressive fund-raising practices in 1996, which came under 
scrutiny and are a potential campaign issue in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would seem that naming somebody your campaign chairman who  
has been the subject of those same kinds of questions and 
criticisms would emphasize a weakness rather than erase it,'' said 
Paul Hendrie of the Center for Responsive Politics in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Coelho and his backers said he was simply keeping up with GOP  
tactics. ``We just took a page out of their political playbook,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	--Coelho headed the Democratic election effort in 1994, when  
Republicans won control of both houses of Congress. Supporters say 
he can't be blamed. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could have been the world's greatest magician and that  
would not have changed the essential facts of 1994,'' Kantor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coelho said he plans no changes in the campaign staff headed by  
Craig Smith, a longtime Clinton aide. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think some folks ... are talking about campaign problems. I  
don't agree with that,'' he said. ``I think this campaign is right 
where it should be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Smith headed the first phase of the campaign, building a  
national organization and hiring campaign staff. Hiring a general 
chairman is the traditional second step of a presidential campaign, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a good team,'' said Coelho, who won't get paid. ``They  
just need a general coordinator.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Married for 32 years and the father of two adult daughters,  
Coelho has become a staunch advocate for disabled Americans. He has 
epilepsy.

<HEADLINE> Wynton Marsalis Plays Ellington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ``Duke Ellington loved life. And he wanted you  
to love it, too. He was going to help you love it. That's the main 
thing about his music, I guess.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wynton Marsalis, artistic director of Jazz at Lincoln Center, is  
at home, talking about ``Swingin' with Duke,'' a 90-minute show 
airing Wednesday at 9 p.m. EDT as part of the ``Great 
Performances'' series on PBS. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellington -- pianist, band leader and America's most prolific  
composer, with some 2,000 titles -- died in 1974 at 75. April 29 was 
the 100th anniversary of his birth. He is being celebrated with 
performances all year by the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra, which 
is led by 37-year-old Marsalis. 
</P>
<P>
	On the TV show, the Lincoln Center musicians play 16 pieces,  
including ``Sophisticated Lady,'' ``Mood Indigo,'' ``Black and Tan 
Fantasy'' and ``Portrait of Louis Armstrong'' from ``New Orleans 
Suite,'' with trumpeter Marsalis soloing. 
</P>
<P>
	Film clips show Ellington being interviewed, working and playing  
the charming showman on-stage. Ella Fitzgerald is seen singing with 
the Ellington Band. Guests of the Lincoln Center orchestra include 
singer Dianne Reeves, saxophonist Illinois Jacquet and more than a 
dozen dancers capable of doing the lindy-hop, one of the popular 
dances of Ellington's heyday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra uses Ellington arrangements.  
``Unless we had somebody who could arrange better than him, we 
wouldn't change them,'' Marsalis says. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people say, `To play the music of Duke Ellington is to  
step back in time.' That's not right. You go forward in Duke 
Ellington's music; you don't go back to it,'' Marsalis says. ``Duke 
used to say music is neither new nor old. It sounds contemporary 
today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the show Marsalis says, ``We're trying to be in the  
spirit of Duke. We're not trying to recreate what he did. You can't 
do that. We try to bring ourselves to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not trying to keep this music alive. It is alive,'' he  
says. 
</P>
<P>
	On the show Marsalis is seen instructing high school jazz band  
directors about performing Ellington. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're easy to work with,'' Marsalis says during the  
interview in his apartment near Lincoln Center. ``When I traveled 
around the country doing workshops at high schools these last 15 or 
16 years, I didn't want to step on the band leader's authority. 
They always said, `Man, tell them. Don't worry about me. Help my 
kids.''' 
</P>
<P>
	This year's fourth annual ``Jazz at Lincoln Center Ellington  
High School Band Competition and Festival'' sent the sheet music 
for six Ellington tunes to 1,307 bands in 50 states. Of those, 169 
bands sent in tapes of them playing that music. Twenty bands were 
brought to New York for three days and competed on May 1. Bands 
from New York City, West Hartford, Conn., and Houston took the top 
three places. 
</P>
<P>
	Marsalis says he and the Lincoln Center ensemble try to play  
better than the Ellington Band. ``Chances of that are very slim,'' 
he says. ``But that's what we try to do. We don't walk around 
viewing the old recordings like the Holy Grail. Music has a 
functional purpose -- that is, to be played. I'm sure that's how 
Duke felt about music. I think he would have liked what we're 
playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marsalis feels he knows Ellington through his compositions. On  
the show, he says Ellington put the discrimination he felt against 
black people into his music. ``It represents affirmation in the 
face of adversity; let's look up, let's not look down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also calls Ellington a champion flirter and charmer of women.  
``It's part of the sweetness of life. He was the master,'' Marsalis 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	Marsalis himself is releasing 14 CDs this year. ``It was my idea  
to do so many,'' he says. The purpose: ``Just to get the creativity 
out.''

<HEADLINE> Continental, TWA Top Airline Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Frequent travelers say in a survey that  
Continental Airlines and TWA did the best job of satisfying them 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Continental ranked first for long-haul flights -- those over 500  
miles -- while TWA placed first for short flights. 
</P>
<P>
	Continental's strengths were on-time performance, speedy airport  
check-in and quality food and delivery, according to the survey 
results, which were released Tuesday. TWA's were airport check-in 
process, availability and frequency of flights and seating comfort. 
</P>
<P>
	The annual survey was based on 6,520 flight evaluations from a  
national sample of frequent fliers who average 27 U.S. round trips 
each year. It was paid for by J.D. Power and Associates and 
Frequent Flyer magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	In an era when planes are consistently running more than 70  
percent full, the survey found that the single largest percentage 
of travelers -- 26 percent -- consider on-time performance as their 
most important issue. In second place was the swiftness of airport 
check-in, deemed the most important by 15 percent of the 
respondents. 
</P>
<P>
	``This widening gap in passenger satisfaction between  
high-ranking and marginal airlines indicates a greater need for 
improvement in both long- and short-haul segments,'' said Steve 
Cohen, manager of the airline practice at J.D. Power. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the study, Continental was followed by TWA and  
American Airlines in terms of long-haul satisfaction. The remaining 
major airlines fell below the industry average for passenger 
satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
	In terms of short-haul performance, TWA was followed by  
Southwest Airlines, Continental, Delta, America West and US 
Airways. Again, the remaining major airlines fell below the 
industry average. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, TWA placed first in long-haul satisfaction, followed  
by Continental, United, America West and American. In 1998, America 
West placed first in passenger satisfaction for short-haul trips, 
followed by Continental, TWA, Southwest and US Airways. 
</P>
<P>
	Airline rankings tend to vary by year and the party conducting  
the research. A recent study by two university teachers placed US 
Airways atop a list of airline quality. It was followed by 
Continental, American, Delta, Southwest, America West, TWA, Alaska, 
Northwest and United Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, published by Dean Headley, associate professor of  
marketing at Wichita State University in Kansas, and Brent Bowen, 
director of the Aviation Institute at the University of Nebraska, 
used 15 criteria for ranking airline quality. 
</P>
<P>
	They included on-time performance, denied boardings, mishandled  
luggage and passenger complaints.

<HEADLINE> Productivity Rises 4.0 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's productivity rose at a  
stronger-than-expected pace in the first three months of the year 
as the economy continued to demonstrate an ability to generate 
rapid growth without inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department reported Today that productivity, measured  
as the amount of output per hour of work, climbed at an annual rate 
of 4 percent in the January-March quarter, fully 1 percentage point 
higher than private economists had been expecting. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new economic paradigm still lives,'' said Marilyn Schaja,  
economist at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. ``Because of strong 
productivity gains, economic activity can take place at a strong 
pace without a surge in inflationary pressures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Productivity is considered the key measurement to support future  
increases in living standards. Faster growth in productivity means 
that companies can pay their workers more, financing the raises by 
increased output rather than increased prices. The absence of price 
increases means workers' pay raises go even further. 
</P>
<P>
	No less an authority than Federal Reserve Chairman Alan  
Greenspan said in a speech last week that he believed the recent 
solid advances in productivity, after decades of productivity 
weakness, marked a fundamental change in the U.S. economy and 
represented a payoff for business investments in computers and 
other productivity-enhancing tools. 
</P>
<P>
	While warning that productivity cannot keep inflation forever at  
bay, Greenspan called the combination of rapid growth, the lowest 
unemployment rates in nearly three decades and low inflation rates 
``truly phenomenal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets took a nosedive after the speech, however,  
focusing instead on Greenspan's worries that at some point rising 
wage pressures will overwhelm the productivity gains and spark 
higher inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said Tuesday's report should allay Greenspan's worries.  
They said when Fed policy makers meet next Tuesday, the Fed 
probably will leave interest rates unchanged and will also leave 
their policy directive in the neutral, meaning the Fed's next move 
could as likely be a rate cut as a rate increase. 
</P>
<P>
	``One would have to conclude from these numbers that Greenspan  
is willing to let the grand experiment go forward,'' said Paul 
Kasriel, senior economist at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan and his colleagues at the Fed, believing that all the  
business investment in recent years is paying off in higher 
productivity, has been willing to let unemployment drop far lower 
than economists previously believed possible before becoming 
alarmed about inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the current expansion, analysts believed the unemployment  
rate could not drop below 6 percent without triggering wage 
pressures. Unemployment is currently 4.3 percent, and it has been 
at or below 4.5 percent for the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasriel said he does not support the ``new economy'' theory,  
arguing that other factors such as the global financial crisis, 
which has pushed one-third of the world into recession, is more 
responsible for the benign inflation performance than any permanent 
improvement in productivity. 
</P>
<P>
	But economist Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National  
Association of Manufacturers, said productivity has been crucial to 
keeping companies profitable without having to resort to higher 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``Productivity is the key element of American economic strength  
at a time when, due to intense competition, companies can't raise 
prices,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Through the 1950s and 1960s, American productivity recorded  
impressive annual gains averaging 3 percent a year, allowing 
American workers to enjoy healthy rising gains in living standards. 
But since 1973, productivity increases have been at anemic annual 
rates of around 1 percent. Last year, however, productivity climbed 
by 2.2 percent, double the annual average in the previous two 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first three months of this year, unit labor costs,  
considered the key to future inflation pressure, edged up just 0.3 
percent at an annual rate, reflecting that while hourly 
compensation was up, much of it was paid for by the increase in 
hourly output. 
</P>
<P>
	Unit labor costs actually fell at a 0.4 percent annual rate in  
the fourth quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The upturn in productivity has been led by big gains in the  
manufacturing sector, which continued in the first quarter. 
Productivity at U.S. factories was up 5.8 percent in the first 
quarter, even better than a 5.3 percent fourth quarter advance.

<HEADLINE>  Wash. Tour Bus Crashes, Injuring 9 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nine people were injured Monday a half-mile  
from the White House in a fiery tour bus accident that involved an 
armored truck and three cars, said a District of Columbia Fire 
Department official. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the injuries is believed to be life-threatening, said  
Battalion Chief William Mould. An emergency room doctor at George 
Washington University Hospital said people treated there suffered 
mostly bumps and bruises. 
</P>
<P>
	Mould said witnesses helped save the lives of the seven people  
on the bus -- a tourist family and the driver -- by getting the 
injured out quickly before the propane-powered vehicle burst into 
flames. The family on the Old Town Trolley Tours bus consisted of 
two parents, two grandparents, and two children, he said. Their 
identities were not released. 
</P>
<P>
	The tour company operates a fleet of buses that tour Washington  
landmarks. The small wood and Fiberglas vehicle, designed to 
resemble an early 20th-century trolley car, collided with a car in 
northwest Washington before striking a stopped armored car and two 
parked vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	``In less than 30 seconds the entire bus was engulfed in  
flames,'' said an unidentified eyewitness who helped pull victims 
off the damaged bus. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to those on the bus, the armored truck driver was  
injured, and a man in a parked truck nearby said he was injured by 
flying glass, Mould said.

<HEADLINE> Nostradamus Fever Grips Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Every week, millions of Japanese TV viewers tune in  
to watch a couple of men building a bunker for the end of the 
world. It's a race against time. They have to finish before July. 
</P>
<P>
	As the end of the century nears, Japan has come under an odd  
spell -- the apocalyptic preachings of the 16th century soothsayer 
Nostradamus. 
</P>
<P>
	Bookshelves are lined with Nostradamus spinoffs. Celebrities  
comment earnestly on his predictions. The Internet is awash with 
thousands of Japanese Web sites devoted to the French prophet of 
doom. 
</P>
<P>
	``Will mankind be extinguished in 1999?'' one typical Web site  
says. ``This is not an issue to be taken lightly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nostradamus, whose prophecies made him so famous in his lifetime  
that he came under the patronage of Catherine de Medicis, has been 
a household name in Japan for over two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	And he's always been big during times of crisis.  
</P>
<P>
	During the oil shock of the 1970s, a Japanese author penned the  
best-selling book that first introduced Nostradamus' prophecies to 
a mass audience in Japan. It sold more than 2 million copies. 
</P>
<P>
	Another wave of interest in Nostradamus broke out during the  
1991 Persian Gulf War, which spawned a cottage industry in World 
War III predictions. 
</P>
<P>
	But the current gloom of Japan's recession and jitters about the  
international situation -- from the war in Kosovo to missile tests 
by North Korea -- have created the most virulent Nostradamus boom 
yet, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's excessive,'' said Teigo Yoshida, a professor of cultural  
anthropology at Japan's prestigious Tokyo University. ``In times of 
social uncertainty, these theories gain popularity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As evidence of Nostradamus' popularity, two dozen books on him  
or his predictions were published in Japan last year. Eleven more 
have been released so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Timing, of course, has given Nostradamus a strong boost.  
</P>
<P>
	``There has been a big surge in the popularity of Nostradamus  
with the last year of the millennium,'' said Fumiko Takahashi, a 
spokeswoman for the Japan's Publishers Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Nostradamus predicted millennium doom, writing that ``the great  
king of terror will fall from the sky in the seventh month of the 
year 1999.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nostradamus' prophecies, which were written in verse and  
collected in a book called ``Centuries,'' are extremely cryptic and 
open to a wide range of interpretations. 
</P>
<P>
	But that hasn't prevented Nostradamus buffs from making some  
very precise inferences. 
</P>
<P>
	In a book published in February, author Akio Cho even purports  
to have discovered ``through scientific research'' the precise hour 
and date of the great cataclysm: 5 p.m., July 24, 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Few people are seriously preparing for the end -- to most  
Japanese, the boom is more an entertaining distraction than 
anything else. 
</P>
<P>
	But a recent poll conducted by Japan's Kokugakuin University  
found 20 percent of the people responding give some credence to the 
Nostradamus prophecies. 
</P>
<P>
	And the trend does have its hardcore believers, and a darker  
side. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the beliefs espoused by Japan's Aum Shinri Kyo ``Supreme  
Truth'' cult -- which killed 13 people in a 1995 subway gas attack -- 
appear to have been inspired by Nostradamus' writings. 
</P>
<P>
	The cult, which has been increasing in popularity lately even  
though most of its leaders have been arrested, is preparing for an 
Armageddon that it claims will come in early September. 
</P>
<P>
	Other religious cults in Japan have borrowed ideas from the  
Nostradamus prophecies to attract followers. 
</P>
<P>
	Yoshida, the anthropologist, said Japan is fertile ground for  
Nostradamus because the occult has a powerful hold on many aspects 
of everyday Japanese life. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortune teller stands line the streets in busy shopping  
districts, and the Chinese zodiac is used to set the dates for 
everything from weddings to elections. 
</P>
<P>
	``More and more Japanese are turning to superstition,'' he said.  
``People's anxieties are pushing them to search for answers in the 
supernatural.''

<HEADLINE>  Wash. Tour Bus Crashes, Injuring 9 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nine people were injured Monday a half-mile  
from the White House in a fiery tour bus accident that involved an 
armored truck and three cars, said a District of Columbia Fire 
Department official. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the injuries is believed to be life-threatening, said  
Battalion Chief William Mould. An emergency room doctor at George 
Washington University Hospital said people treated there suffered 
mostly bumps and bruises. 
</P>
<P>
	Mould said witnesses helped save the lives of the seven people  
on the bus -- a tourist family and the driver -- by getting the 
injured out quickly before the propane-powered vehicle burst into 
flames. The family on the Old Town Trolley Tours bus consisted of 
two parents, two grandparents, and two children, he said. Their 
identities were not released. 
</P>
<P>
	The tour company operates a fleet of buses that tour Washington  
landmarks. The small wood and Fiberglas vehicle, designed to 
resemble an early 20th-century trolley car, collided with a car in 
northwest Washington before striking a stopped armored car and two 
parked vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	``In less than 30 seconds the entire bus was engulfed in  
flames,'' said an unidentified eyewitness who helped pull victims 
off the damaged bus. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to those on the bus, the armored truck driver was  
injured, and a man in a parked truck nearby said he was injured by 
flying glass, Mould said.

<HEADLINE> Yzerman Wary of Colorado Road Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Steve Yzerman leads by example, which might be  
why the Detroit Red Wings have yet to lose in the NHL playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The team's captain is leading the league with eight postseason  
goals, tying a personal best, while the Red Wings have yet to lose 
in six games. 
</P>
<P>
	They take a 2-0 series lead into tonight's game with Colorado.  
Game 4 of the best-of-7 series with the Avalanche is set for 
Thursday night at Joe Louis Arena. Still, Yzerman sounded a note of 
caution. 
</P>
<P>
	``Remember, the Avalanche have a great road record, better than  
at home,'' Yzerman said. ``They have an experienced team. We by no 
means can relax and feel good about everything. 
</P>
<P>
	``They could get back into this one if we aren't careful.''  
</P>
<P>
	Colorado is 1-4 at home, but 3-0 on the road in the playoffs.  
</P>
<P>
	``Look at our road record,'' Avalanche coach Bob Hartley said.  
``I have lots of faith in my players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He'd feel better, however, if the Avalanche would play just a  
little bit smarter. Hartley asked the players not to take bad 
penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, in Game 1, the Red Wings -- seeking their third straight  
Stanley Cup championship -- were handed seven power plays and scored 
on two of them. Detroit won that game 3-2 in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	In the second game, Colorado put the Red Wings on the power play  
seven more times and, again, they converted two into scores on 
their way to a 4-0 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``Loss of discipline comes from frustration,'' Hartley said,  
``and that's one thing we have to learn to control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Discipline also can come from leadership and the Red Wings, as  
they did in the 1998 playoffs, are getting plenty of that from 
Yzerman. 
</P>
<P>
	``Steve usually gets scoring chances,'' Detroit coach Scotty  
Bowman said. ``I don't worry about his scoring. When he steps up 
and scores, everybody feels that's what he can do and it just sort 
of feeds the other guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Avalanche, on the other hand, haven't had much production  
from their two main leaders -- captain Joe Sakic and center Peter 
Forsberg. They have just one point between them in the series, an 
assist by Forsberg in Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Forsberg has been having a bad series in other ways. He put his  
team in a deep hole by drawing a boarding penalty and a game 
misconduct midway through Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Did he learn his lesson?  
</P>
<P>
	Apparently not. Forsberg was called for boarding Chris Chelios  
in Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got so much skill there shouldn't be six guys in this  
whole league that could stop us,'' Avalanche defenseman Aaron 
Miller said. ``But we've got to play as a team. Twenty great 
players running around isn't going to win anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The victory in Game 2 was the 200th playoff win for Detroit  
coach Scotty Bowman, extending his NHL record. He's already 77 
ahead of runnerup Al Arbour. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Wings have won 11 straight playoff games, including five  
last season. The NHL record is 14 by the Pittsburgh Penguins in 
1992-93. None other than Bowman was coaching the Penguins in those 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't really think about it,'' Bowman said. ``Somebody told  
me before the playoffs, but that's the only time I thought about 
it. I worry more about the 111 losses.''

<HEADLINE> Shipbuilding Takeover Talks OK'd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Avondale Industries' board agreed Tuesday to  
open discussions with Litton Industries Inc. about its takeover 
bid, saying it might be superior to Avondale's previous agreement 
to merge with Newport News Shipbuilding Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The Woodland Hills, Calif.-based Litton has offered to buy both  
Avondale and Newport News for a total of $1.76 billion. The offer 
for Avondale was for $38 a share, or $504 million in cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Avondale and Newport News had previously agreed to merge in a  
$470 million deal and has already received approval from the 
Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport News's board hasn't taken a public position on the  
Litton offer and could not be immediately reached for comment 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a statement issued the day the buyout proposal was  
disclosed, chairman and CEO William P. Fricks said the board would 
conduct ``preliminary discussions'' with Litton ``to fully evaluate 
the terms of the offer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newport News, Va.-based Newport News Shipbuilding builds all the  
Navy's aircraft carriers and many of its submarines, and it repairs 
and performs maintenance on various types of Navy ships. 
</P>
<P>
	New Orleans-based Avondale designs, builds and overhauls Navy  
surface ships as well as commercial vessels. 
</P>
<P>
	The Litton offer came three weeks after the Pentagon rejected a  
merger between defense giants General Dynamics Corp. and Newport 
News Shipbuilding on grounds the proposed $2 billion deal would 
have created a single shipbuilder for all nuclear submarines and 
would have reduced competition in other sectors of military 
shipbuilding.

<HEADLINE> Counselors in Demand After Storms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Tornadoes that ripped across central  
Oklahoma left more than a mere physical reminder of the federal 
building bombing that killed 168 people and stunned this city. 
</P>
<P>
	Counselors say survivors, rescue workers and others involved in  
the 1995 explosion are now grappling with the same kind of 
emotional repercussions as a result of the twisters. 
</P>
<P>
	``The majority of folks we're seeing are those who have been  
doubly impacted,'' Project Heartland director Gwen Allen said 
Monday. Her program's four counselors ``have been run off our 
feet'' by demands for assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	Project Heartland, created with a federal grant to help the  
community deal with the trauma of the bombing, is trying to 
determine how many more counselors are needed to provide emotional 
aid to tornado victims, Ms. Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Counselors predict that storm victims, like those who survived  
the bombing, may suffer feelings of fear, anxiety, depression and 
agitation. The additional loss of homes could create other worries, 
Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
	The May 3 tornado tore a path through the Oklahoma City suburbs  
and surrounding towns, leaving 41 dead. One 23-year-old woman blown 
from underneath a highway overpass remained missing Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Moore, children who were left without homes -- or books or  
pencils -- returned to the waiting arms of their teachers Monday in 
borrowed classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have a building. But we've got each other,'' Kelley  
Elementary School Principal Kay Engle told pupils, her voice 
cracking. ``We will build our school back, and it will be better 
than ever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Engle estimated about 300 of the school's 450 children were back  
in class. Half the students raised their hands when she asked if 
their homes had been destroyed in the storms. 
</P>
<P>
	In a borrowed classroom, Janice West's sixth grade math and  
science class took turns telling their stories of survival. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't remember anything except screaming and praying and  
stuff,'' a girl with long blond hair said, as her classmates stared 
at the floor. ``I got up and looked out of the windows and hardly 
anything was there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The class groaned when Ms. West said she had an assignment for  
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a lifelong assignment,'' she said. ``Appreciate each  
person, regardless of your feelings for them. The value of a 
person's life is something we cannot replace.''

<HEADLINE> Case: Internet a Civil Rights Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Citing figures indicating that blacks and  
Hispanics have less exposure to the Internet and its countless 
services, AOL Chairman Steve Case told an audience of civil rights 
advocates Tuesday that equal access to online services is ``the 
civil rights issue of the 21st century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a question of how we make these tools available to all  
Americans,'' Case said at the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights 
lunch at the National Press Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Using figures from a 1998 Commerce Department study on minority  
access to the Internet, Case said whites are more than twice as 
likely to own a computer as blacks and Hispanics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want the Internet to be part of the solution, not part of  
the problem,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Case also called for work place diversity and said that low  
numbers of minority students graduating in the technical sciences 
gave him reason to be concerned. But Case said AOL will try to do 
the best it can with strong recruitment and outreach efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Case nor Corporate Relations Vice President David Eisner  
could provide figures of minority employees at AOL. 
</P>
<P>
	With 12,000 employees, AOL is the world's largest Internet  
access and online service provider.

<HEADLINE> Disney, Katzenberg Spat Nears End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Walt Disney Co. chairman Michael Eisner was  
driven by principle -- not animosity -- while negotiating a bonus for 
former Disney film boss Jeffrey Katzenberg, an attorney argued 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In closing statements of Katzenberg's breach of contract  
lawsuit, Disney lawyer Lou Meisinger tried to humanize Eisner, who 
has been portrayed by the plaintiff's attorney as being vindictive. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there's any villain in this drama, it's not Mr. Eisner,''  
Meisinger said. 
</P>
<P>
	Katzenberg has sued Disney, claiming the company owes him at  
least $250 million in bonuses for work he did as head of its film 
division before he resigned in 1994. Disney says Katzenberg 
forfeited the bonus because he left two years before the end of his 
six-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial is being arbitrated by retired Superior Court Judge  
Paul Breckenridge in the offices of Katzenberg's attorney, Bert 
Fields. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney and Katzenberg had reached a partial settlement, which  
was sealed by the court but was reportedly $77 million. This phase 
of the case is meant to determine how big of a bonus Katzenberg 
should receive. The judge is expected to make a decision within two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The case has blossomed into a bitter Hollywood feud, but Eisner  
was simply acting like a competent executive when he refused to 
allow Katzenberg to receive a 2 percent bonus on the company's 
future income after resigning, Meisinger said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eisner ``was not driven by animosity but driven by principle,''  
the lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eisner repeatedly tried to negotiate a settlement after  
Katzenberg's lawsuit was filed in 1996, but the company was 
snubbed, Meisinger said. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are not the acts of a man driven by hatred,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The company's position, Meisinger argued, has been hampered by  
the absence of the late Disney president Frank Wells, a key figure 
in the 1988 Katzenberg contract negotiations who was killed in a 
1997 helicopter crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney has been forced to piece together letters and memos to  
determine exactly what was owed Katzenberg; Wells' absence 
``permits Mr. Katzenberg to refute whatever statements he wants, 
Meisinger said. 
</P>
<P>
	In his rebuttal, Fields argued that the case boiled down to  
Eisner's animosity of Katzenberg. The lawyer displayed a poster 
board with Eisner's mug shot in the center, surrounded by quotes he 
has made about Katzenberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the quotes attributed to Eisner were: ``Jeffrey was my  
retriever,'' and ``He was the end of my pompom. I'm the 
cheerleader.''

<HEADLINE> Tie Admitted to Drug Scandal Figure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Two cyclists, one in France and the other in  
Belgium, admitted Tuesday they had received substances supplied by 
a man being investigated in the drug scandal which enveloped the 
sport. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Virenque, a leading French rider, admitted he used  
products given him by Bertrand Sainz, according to judicial 
officials who spoke on condition their names would not be used. 
</P>
<P>
	In Brussels, Belgium, World Cup circuit leader Frank  
Vandenbrocke said he received injections from Sainz. But, 
Vandenbrocke said he was under the impression he was getting 
homeopathic products. 
</P>
<P>
	Sainz is one of five people being investigated for involvement  
in what is described as a drug-supplying network. 
</P>
<P>
	Virenque, a former Festina cyclist, was at the center of last  
summer's Tour de France scandal. Unlike other prominent Festina 
riders, he has continually denied he knowingly took banned 
substances. 
</P>
<P>
	Sainz is accused of setting up the network along with the  
attorney Betrand Lavelot, who in the past has defended Virenque 
against doping allegations. Lavelot is also under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	French police have seized documents showing that Sainz exchanged  
information on cyclists' blood tests with Lavelot. Both men deny 
this proves they supplied drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the scandal, Tour de France president Jean-Marie Leblanc  
insisted that this year's tour will go ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no reason why the tour shouldn't take place,'' he  
told RTL radio. ``If it wasn't necessary to have the Tour de 
France, then there would be no reason to have the Tour of Italy, 
the Grand Prix of Midi Libre, the Dauphine Libre or the Tour of 
Switzerland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vandenbroucke said his motive in taking the shots was pure.  
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe I was naive but I did not act in bad faith,'' said  
Vandenbroucke, who has won six races this season as he shot up the 
world rankings. ``I don't think it was doping, but I'm worried 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vandenbroucke's French team Cofidis said he would be immediately  
fired if products seized by the French police and linked to 
Vandenbroucke turned out to include banned substances. 
</P>
<P>
	The Belgian star said Sainz, who is being held in a French jail  
on charges of illegally practicing medicine, had been treating him 
since early this year. ``He told me these were innocent homeopathic 
products. I trusted him,'' Vandenbroucke told a news conference one 
day after Cofidis suspended him and teammate Philippe Gaumont. 
</P>
<P>
	Vandenbroucke has not been charged in the French doping scandal,  
but he was taken in for interrogation last week. He has passed all 
drug tests on the cycling circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	In Madrid, Spanish teams ONCE and Banesto threatened to skip  
this year's Tour de France, citing concern there will be a repeat 
of the drug searches that marred last year's event, a newspaper 
reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	All four Spanish teams taking part in last year's race pulled  
out to protest how French police treated ONCE members when the 
scandal erupted following seizure of performance-enhancing drugs 
from top-ranked Festina.

<HEADLINE> Nike Signs Chamique Holdsclaw </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Nike Inc. has signed basketball sensation  
Chamique Holdsclaw to a five-year contract that could be the most 
ever paid for a woman athlete. 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw, who led the University of Tennessee to three national  
championships in four years, might be the top endorsement prospect 
in this year's crop of incoming college players, man or woman. The 
Washington Mystics of the WNBA made her this year's top draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Nike officials would not disclose any financial terms. They did  
say they're thrilled to sign her. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had our eye on her for quite a while,'' said Sandi  
Bittler, director of women's sports marketing at Nike. The deal 
``underscores our commitment to women's sports.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw's agent, Lon Babby, told reporters the contract is  
``by far'' the most ever paid for a woman athlete. 
</P>
<P>
	Some industry observers predicted that Holdsclaw would be the  
first female athlete to sign a $1 million endorsement contract for 
athletic shoes. But agents close to the situation said Holdsclaw's 
contract, though in the six-figure-a-year range, falls far short of 
$1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Nike convinced Holdsclaw to go with a ``head-to-toe'' deal that  
will require her to wear Nike headwear and apparel in addition to 
basketball shoes. The company intends to build a signature shoe for 
Holdsclaw, a process that will take about a year, Nike officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw's availability prompted a heated scramble among the  
country's leading athletic shoe companies. According to industry 
sources, Adidas America, Reebok and Puma also bid for Holdsclaw. 
</P>
<P>
	Adidas had hoped its schoolwide sponsorship of Tennessee would  
give it the inside track with Holdsclaw. ``We're grateful for the 
time we had her, and we wish her luck,'' said Robert Erb, Adidas' 
director of sports marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	But Nike made its interest in Holdsclaw abundantly clear,  
despite her school's Adidas connection. Nike staffers attended 
every Lady Vols game this year. The company also wooed her by 
helping set up meetings with Michael Jordan.

<HEADLINE> NATO Defends Strikes to World Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- Stopping NATO airstrikes before  
there is peace in Kosovo would allow Yugoslavia to complete 
``ethnic cleansing'' in the southern Serb province, alliance 
members told the World Court on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Belgrade claims the airstrikes that began March 24 breach the  
U.N. charter and other international treaties, including the 1948 
Genocide Convention. It wants the U.N.'s highest judicial body to 
order the bombing stopped while the court decides on the legality 
of the air campaign, a process that could take years. 
</P>
<P>
	Any ruling by the court would likely have little effect. If the  
court orders a halt to airstrikes and NATO keeps bombing, 
Yugoslavia can only report the alliance to the U.N. Security 
Council -- which is dominated by NATO members. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10 NATO members involved in the bombing insist their air  
campaign is a legally justified intervention aimed at ending a 
humanitarian catastrophe -- Yugoslavia's forced eviction of hundreds 
of thousands of ethnic Albanians from Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``NATO refused to stand idly by to watch yet another campaign of  
ethnic cleansing unfold in the heart of Europe,'' U.S. State 
Department legal adviser David Andrews told the court. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven allies -- Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain,  
Britain and the United States presented their cases Tuesday. 
Belgium, Canada and France addressed the court Monday after 
Yugoslavia outlined its case. 
</P>
<P>
	The NATO allies argued that the court, formally known as the  
International Court of Justice, has no jurisdiction because 
Yugoslavia is not a United Nations member. They said Belgrade's 
genocide claims are a ploy to underpin its weak case. A clause in 
the genocide convention names the World Court as the venue to 
resolve disputes arising from the convention. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslavia accused the allies of genocide against the Yugoslav  
people, claiming NATO is endangering the entire population with 
pollution caused by attacks on oil refineries and chemical plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrews called the Yugoslav claims of genocide ``a feat of  
hypocrisy and cynicism of Orwellian proportions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides will be given time to reply. The court was expected  
to rule within weeks.

<HEADLINE> Smithsonian Opens Discovery Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Accepting that stuffed elephants and dinosaur  
bones are no longer enough to teach people about their world, the 
National Museum of Natural History opens its new Discovery Center 
on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``In today's world, a museum cannot be unchanging and passive,''  
said Smithsonian Secretary I. Michael Heyman. ``The Discovery 
Center extends the ways natural history can be brought to museum 
visitors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The goal of the museum is ``to help people understand the  
natural world and the integral role of humanity in it,'' added 
Robert Fri, director of the Natural History Museum. 
</P>
<P>
	Focus of the center is the S.C. Johnson IMAX theater, the  
Smithsonian Institution's second giant-screen theater. 
</P>
<P>
	More than six-stories high, the theater fills a former courtyard  
in the original 1910 museum building. 
</P>
<P>
	Beneath it is a new museum cafeteria and expanded gift shops,  
and atop the theater is a room planned for future high-technology 
science. 
</P>
<P>
	The theater is named for Samuel C. Johnson, head of the SC  
Johnson consumer products company and a former regent of the 
Smithsonian who donated $1 million toward the project. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Johnson also announced that he plans to make a  
donation to the District of Columbia schools to cover the cost of a 
field trip to the museum next year for every sixth-grade student in 
the district. 
</P>
<P>
	Discovery Communications, which operates several cable  
television channels, including the Discovery Channel, the Learning 
Channel and the Travel Channel, also contributed to the project.

<HEADLINE> Woman Sentenced for Fake Hate Mail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A black woman who sent phony hate mail to  
prominent blacks in a scheme to defraud United Parcel Service out 
of hundreds of thousands of dollars was sentenced Tuesday to five 
years and five months in federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Angela Jackson, 29, a former law student, claimed that white  
racists working for the shipping company had damaged or lost 
packages containing art works. 
</P>
<P>
	She tried to collect $143,500 for each loss, and to make her  
claim credible, scrawled racist remarks on letters sent via UPS to 
several prominent black leaders, including the Rev. Jesse Jackson, 
NAACP President Kweisi Mfume and eight members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Her aim was to make it appear the remarks were written by UPS  
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were so many falsehoods and lies, they were like  
dandelions in the spring grass,'' U.S. District Judge Charles 
Norgle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, who is not related to Jesse Jackson, was also convicted  
of trying to torpedo the career of a Chicago police sergeant who 
arrested her in 1996 by making it look as if the officer had stolen 
her credit card. 
</P>
<P>
	She took the witness stand at her trial and tried to talk her  
way out of trouble but became hostile and defiant under 
cross-examination. At one point, she called prosecutor Ryan Stoll 
``an animal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the sentencing, she apologized to her family, seated in  
court, saying she was ``sorry that their introduction to the 
American judicial system had to be so negative.''

<HEADLINE> Satellite Still Short of Orbit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- The Air Force is blaming Mother  
Nature for its latest satellite mishap. 
</P>
<P>
	A military Global Positioning System satellite got rained on  
over the weekend, even though it was in a protective room at the 
launch pad. As a result, the flight is on indefinite hold until 
workers can repair any damage. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the latest in a series of problems at Cape Canaveral Air  
Station and has prompted the Air Force to convene a review board. 
</P>
<P>
	The GPS satellite had been scheduled for launch as early as this  
weekend aboard a Boeing Delta II rocket. It will be removed later 
this week from the rocket and inspected for damage. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of the mishap, the satellite was shrouded atop the  
rocket. Lightning forced technicians to interrupt their routine 
tests and evacuate the pad. When they returned, they discovered 
rain had leaked onto the satellite. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force Brig. Gen. Randy Starbuck, who's in charge of the  
launch facility, said workers will take their time in checking the 
satellite. ``We are not in a hurry to launch rockets here,'' he 
stressed. 
</P>
<P>
	The delay is expected to be at least a couple weeks and probably  
longer. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the Air Force launched two satellites into useless  
orbits aboard Titan IV rockets. The rocket line, made by Lockheed 
Martin Corp., had been grounded since a midair explosion last 
August. 
</P>
<P>
	And just last week, a Boeing Delta III rocket placed an Orion  
communication satellite into the wrong orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	Ground controllers for satellite maker Hughes Space and  
Communications Co. used on-board thrusters Friday night to raise 
the low end of the lopsided orbit from 98 miles to 262 miles. But 
the Orion satellite was still far short of the intended 
22,300-mile-high altitude and chances of it ever getting there are 
slim. 
</P>
<P>
	``They accomplished what they wanted to accomplish, which was to  
get it out of the Earth's atmosphere,'' said Hughes spokesman Emery 
Wilson. ``At this time, we're kind of waiting for our customer to 
decide what they would like us to do with the satellite.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Loral Space and Communications, John McCarthy,  
said Monday that the company is looking at all the options. Loral 
had hoped to expand service in Asia and the Pacific with the 
satellite. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second failure in as many launches for the new Delta  
III, a bigger, upgraded version of the Delta II. 
</P>
<P>
	The inaugural flight last August ended in an explosion 71  
seconds after liftoff. This time, the rocket's second stage fired 
for only one second before abruptly shutting down 22 minutes into 
the flight.

<HEADLINE> FDA Issues Warning on 'Party Drugs' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans should avoid more than a half-dozen  
sleep aids and ``party drugs'' sold in health food stores and on 
the Internet because they can send people into comas or even kill, 
the government warned on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The urgent consumer warning is part of repeated Food and Drug  
Administration efforts to remove from the market chemicals related 
to a party drug called GHB that was banned in 1991. But companies 
are selling new varieties of the chemicals in the guise of dietary 
supplements, substances that are largely unregulated. 
</P>
<P>
	At least three deaths are linked to the products and 119 other  
people have suffered serious side effects, including comas, losing 
consciousness and requiring quick insertion of breathing tubes to 
stay alive, the FDA said. 
</P>
<P>
	Do not use products containing the ingredients GHB, or gamma  
hydroxybutyrate; GBL, or gamma butyrolactone; or BD, known as 1,4 
butanediol, the government warned. 
</P>
<P>
	Some such products are sold under the names Revitalize Plus,  
Serenity, Enliven, GHRE, SomatoPro, NRG3, Thunder Nectar and Weight 
Belt Cleaner, the FDA said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're urging people not to use or buy these products,'' agreed  
Texas Health Commissioner William Archer in a separate warning to 
Texans last week that an Austin man had died from consuming 
BD-containing Thunder Nectar. 
</P>
<P>
	GHB is a potent drug that some scientists are studying in  
carefully monitored clinical trials as a possible narcolepsy 
treatment, but all other uses of GHB are illegal. Despite that ban, 
the FDA two years ago discovered laboratories illegally producing 
the odorless, tasteless chemical. It became known as a ``date 
rape'' drug for rendering women helpless when slipped into their 
drinks. 
</P>
<P>
	GBL breaks down into the banned GHB drug, so by law it also is  
illegal, and the FDA began cracking down on those products in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the FDA has discovered that some companies are replacing GBL  
with the equally risky BD in their products. 
</P>
<P>
	This isn't the first time BD has struck: More than 100 New  
Year's partygoers in Los Angeles two years ago became sick after 
drinking ``Cherry fX Bombs'' and ``Orange fX Rush.'' The drinks 
were alleged to be made from the kava plant, but the FDA said the 
maker instead substituted BD, which also is sold as an industrial 
solvent. The maker was fined and sentenced to three months in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	BD can cause dangerously low breathing rates, unconsciousness,  
vomiting, seizures and death. It can increase the effects of 
alcohol and ``is even more dangerous when consumed with other 
depressant drugs,'' the agency warned. 
</P>
<P>
	FDA officials pledged to seize products containing any of the  
chemicals, and already this spring have seized over 1,500 bottles 
from New York and Rhode Island companies. 
</P>
<P>
	But during the crackdown, consumers must guard their own health.  
</P>
<P>
	``We can't be everywhere, so we really want to get the message  
out,'' said FDA drug chief Dr. Janet Woodcock. ``Look at the 
labels. Look very carefully at anything marketed as an aid for 
sleeping,'' and don't consume any of the suspect ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
	The chemicals also may be disguised under the names  
tetramethylene glycol or 2(3H)-Furanone di-hydro.

<HEADLINE> Pitchers With Same Name Start Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Bobby M. Jones of the Colorado Rockies and Bobby  
J. Jones of the New York Mets made history Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The two became the first pitchers with the same first and last  
names to start against each other in more than 100 years. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Elias Sports Bureau, baseball's statistician,  
the last duel between starting pitchers sharing the same name was 
April 16, 1899, when Cincinnati's John B. Taylor met Chicago's John 
W. Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1876, George H. Bradley of Boston and George W. Bradley of  
St. Louis started against each other twice. G.W. Bradley started 
all 64 of St. Louis' games that year.

<HEADLINE>  Independent Team Hires Pete Rose </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Pete Rose is banned from the major  
leagues and ineligible for the Hall of Fame. That means little to 
the Sacramento Steelheads, who look at the career hits leader as an 
inspiration and a publicity windfall. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose, who insists his stint as special instructor for the  
Western Baseball League team is not an effort to generate public 
support for his bid to overturn the ban, was back on a diamond 
Monday with a bat in his hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose will get about $50,000 to work with players averaging  
$1,250 a month, but he took the job because he loves to teach young 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just to help Sacramento. This is not to help Pete  
Rose. This is fun,'' he said. ``I don't go to bed every night and 
pray I can go to the Hall of Fame. I can't live my life in the 
past. Life goes on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rose wore a black long-sleeved shirt, along with designer  
sunglasses and a Steelheads cap. In addition to working with the 
players and giving them a 75-minute inspirational speech Monday, 
Rose will be back May 28 to toss out the ceremonial first pitch at 
Sacramento's home opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose hit fungoes to Steelheads outfielders Monday, and then  
worked with the infielders on rundowns and other game situations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can still hit, I just can't run. I still have good  
hand-to-eye coordination,'' said Rose, who slammed liners and sharp 
grounders toward the aspiring major league outfielders. ``I'm 58 
years old -- I don't look it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rose, indeed, looks pretty good. He has gotten heavier and is  
slowed by aching knees. But he is tanned and fit, and retains the 
intense gaze and peripatetic style that were among his trademarks. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose, a 17-time All-Star and the NL MVP in 1973, agreed in  
August 1989 to accept a lifetime ban after commissioner A. Bartlett 
Giamatti concluded Rose bet on games involving the Cincinnati Reds 
while he was their manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose served five months at a federal prison after pleading  
guilty in April 1990 to two counts of filing false income tax 
returns by failing to report $354,968 in income from autograph 
appearances, memorabilia sales and gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	The career leader in hits with 4,256 and games with 3,562 is  
ineligible for the Hall of Fame as long as the ban is in effect. 
Rose applied for reinstatement in September 1997, but has not 
received a response from current commissioner Bud Selig. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the 14 people banned for life by baseball for gambling  
has been reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose is prohibited from going on the field or clubhouse of any  
major league team, or any minor league team in organized baseball. 
The Western Baseball League is independent and not covered by those 
rules. Monday's appearance was the first time Rose has actually 
worked with players since the ban. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose said he gave a speech to Reds minor leaguers last week in  
Rockford, Ill., and both Rose and his agent, Warren Greene, 
defended that appearance as allowable under the ban. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig's spokesman, Rich Levin, was unaware of the Rockford  
speech, but said if Rose spoke with Reds minor leaguers, it would 
appear to violate the ban. 
</P>
<P>
	Reds general manager Jim Bowden said one of the team's minor  
league officials was in Rockford when Rose visited and had been 
reminded of the terms of Rose's ban. Rockford general manager Bruce 
Keiter also was informed. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were no violations to our knowledge while he was  
there,'' Bowden said. 
</P>
<P>
	Keiter said today that Rose was at the ballpark in Rockford on  
April 29 for a corporate sponsored autograph session but was kept 
far away from the players. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pete may have had conversation with the roving instructors  
because he either managed or played with some of them, but he had 
absolutely no contact with my players,'' Keiter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Steelheads players said they know about the ban, but appreciated  
hearing from Rose. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't idolize Pete Rose, but I respect his accomplishments.  
I loved watching him play,'' said pitcher Ryan Bowen, who played 
for the Houston Astros and Florida Marlins and is now trying to 
resurrect his career with the Steelheads. 
</P>
<P>
	Steelheads owner Bruce Portner said he went looking for a  
controversial figure to create a buzz around his expansion team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course it's for publicity. It helps keep Sacramento in the  
nation's eyes as a baseball town. Remember, there's been no 
professional baseball here for 25 years,'' Portner said. ``Let's 
face it, he's Pete Rose. He's banned but also a legend in 
baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rose was scheduled to give a 15-minute pep talk to the  
Steelheads, but ended up giving a 75-minute speech while standing 
near the pitcher's mound at Sacramento City College's Union 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's incredible to sit and listen to him,'' said catcher Tim  
McIntosh, a former major leaguer who went to spring training with 
the New York Yankees this year. ``He's an idol. He a god. You see a 
lot of guys coming through the clubhouse, but he's got 4,000 
hits.''

<HEADLINE> U S West Cutting Internet Cost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Caught in a race with cable and telephone  
companies for computer users, U S West Inc. on Tuesday announced 
plans to expand its high-speed Internet access service and cut the 
price by 25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The move is a sign that competition is picking up between cable  
and phone industries, which both offer Internet access at speeds at 
least five times faster than a typical computer modem. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West itself was once a player in the cable TV industry, but  
decided to get out in order to focus on the telephone business. The 
cable unit it spun off last year, MediaOne, last week agreed to be 
acquired by AT&AMP;T Corp. as part of a the long-distance carrier's 
goal of delivering phone and other telecommunications services over 
cable TV lines. 
</P>
<P>
	In the competition between cable and phone companies, the key is  
getting the high-speed Internet capability in place at an 
affordable price. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our whole objective is to drive the price down to a consumer  
price level as fast as we can,'' said Joe Zell, president of U S 
West's data networking unit. ``The more that we're able to drive 
the cost of the service down, the more viable it becomes as 
entertainment in the home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U S West cut its price from $40 a month to $29.95 a month for  
its basic digital subscriber line, which processes data at 256 
kilobits a second, compared with 56 kilobits per second in a 
typical computer modem. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, a large software package that takes about an hour  
to download with a 56K modem can be downloaded in about 10 minutes 
via a digital line, Zell said. 
</P>
<P>
	For the line plus unlimited Internet service, U S West cut the  
price from $60 a month to $47.90 a month, Zell said. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West officials also plan to install the necessary equipment  
for the high-speed data lines in more than 250 offices, making the 
service available in more than 40 cities across its 14-state region 
within one year to 18 months, Zell said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to try to drive the market now before the cable  
competitors get a foothold,'' he said in a telephone interview from 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the price cut, similar to those taken recently by  
other Baby Bells, will help make the technology more affordable to 
home and small business computer users. 
</P>
<P>
	``Getting the price down to be competitive with cable is good,''  
said Bruce Kasrel, an industry analyst with Forrester Research. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overall, I would say cable is much more accessible,'' he said.  
``The cable companies are building out for better video and data is 
along for a ride.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Clemente, vice president of online research company Cyber  
Dialog, predicted the U S West cut would trigger an overall price 
reduction by high-speed Internet service providers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll absolutely see the other telephone companies following  
suit,'' Clemente said. 
</P>
<P>
	The high-speed access service is offered by phone companies  
through existing lines with new digital equipment to handle the 
data processing. Cable companies offer the service through upgraded 
digital technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts estimated high-speed Internet services offered by cable  
companies have about 800,000 subscribers nationwide who pay from 
$30 a month to $60 a month. 
</P>
<P>
	High-speed Internet services offered by phone companies have  
about 50,000 nationwide, with costs ranging from $40 a month to 
about $200 a month, said Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
	Zell said U S West has about 30,000 of the phone company  
subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemente said both industries face two significant hurdles:  
getting the technology to households and convincing consumers that 
it is worth their while. 
</P>
<P>
	``High-speed Internet access, with the right market strategy,  
should not be a significant hurdle,'' he said.

<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- In Reno, it's art. Fifteen miles away at the  
Mustang Ranch brothel, it's business. 
</P>
<P>
	At the center of both are the prostitutes. In each setting, they  
make eye contact, but the eyes actually focus somewhere behind you. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Hoerengracht,'' a room-sized tableau of Amsterdam's red  
light district, is in its second American presentation at The 
Nevada Museum of Art. It was last seen in San Diego in 1993, the 
year before artist Edward Kienholz died. 
</P>
<P>
	The mood is dark. The symbolism is vivid.  
</P>
<P>
	The 11 life-size plaster castings of prostitutes are surrounded  
by weathered wood exteriors. Dry leaves dust the walkway around the 
buildings, adding to the autumnal tones of faded gray and brown. A 
bicycle without wheels sits outside a brothel, its chain lying limp 
on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	The heads of the mannequins are enclosed in clear boxes with  
lids that can be shut to hold thoughts and dreams inside while the 
rest of their bodies belong to the next bidder. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even for Nevadans, who live in a state with legalized  
prostitution, the exhibit represents a lifestyle they probably 
couldn't imagine,'' said Steven High, executive director of the 
museum. ```The Hoerengracht' seeks not to criticize prostitution, 
but to signal its presence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly five years after his death, Kienholz still gives a  
playful nudge with his exhibit. Even its name. 
</P>
<P>
	Abutting one of Amsterdam's many commercial waterways, it refers  
to a street named ``Herengracht,'' Dutch for ``gentlemen's canal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's actually in an affluent area apart from the red lights of  
his artwork. But Kienholz couldn't resist inserting an ``o'' to 
create Hoerengracht, meaning ``whore's canal,'' as the show's 
title. 
</P>
<P>
	``It represents how prostitution is dealt with in Amsterdam,''  
High said. ``In most places, it's illegal, criminal. There, the 
police protect the women. It's relatively safe. It's a business. We 
wanted to put it in the context of Nevada brothel politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nevada has three dozen brothels, mostly in rural areas. They are  
forbidden around Las Vegas, Carson City and Reno. The Mustang Ranch 
in Storey County, half an hour east of Reno, is legal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Hoerengracht'' was Kienholz's second artistic foray into  
prostitution during a career that never shied from thorny social 
issues such as illness, madness, abortion, sexuality and neglect of 
the aged. 
</P>
<P>
	His 1961 ``Roxy's'' was his first assemblage and a far grittier  
work based on a brothel near Las Vegas he visited in 1943 when he 
was 16. Kienholz, who grew up in a town near Spokane, Wash., lived 
with his wife, Nancy Reddin Kienholz, in Idaho and Berlin, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a work more negative. Women were represented in a  
different way -- more abstract. This contrasts with that piece,'' 
High said. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert L. Pincus, an art critic with the San Diego  
Union-Tribune, calls ``Roxy's'' shocking with a sort of grim humor 
to it, and sees ``Hoerengracht'' as more haunting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that he always felt that art should be somehow able to  
communicate its images to people who didn't look at that much 
art,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Part of that is to loosely resemble the real world. You're  
walking into the painting, but walking around in a sort of everyday 
surrounding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joanna Frueh, a professor of art history at the University of  
Nevada, Reno, pointed to Kienholz's distinctive use of drizzled 
resin on the models' faces and bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	``You feel that it's raining tears,'' she said. ``It's very  
clear what it's about, but it's not like banging you over the head. 
It's subtle and it's poetic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview shortly before his death at 66, Kienholz told  
the Los Angeles Times he was drawn to Amsterdam's red light 
district in 1970 because the streets explode with color. 
</P>
<P>
	``Another reason I wanted to do the piece is that I simply like  
whores,'' he said. ``You can learn more from them than you can from 
most people because they've experienced a ... lot more than most 
people. And, of course, the subject appeals to the voyeur in me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's a voyeuristic stroll through the streets where the women  
stand on display under the red bulbs or sit and wait. One touches 
up her lipstick, a tiny television and half-empty pack of 
cigarettes on the table behind her. 
</P>
<P>
	Bric-a-brac and tacky figurines clutter shelves. White light  
fills the cribs. A radio plays. A minute timer sits next to a 
romance magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Nancy Reddin Kienholz, who was born the year her late husband  
visited Roxy's and collaborated with him on ``Hoerengracht,'' 
didn't share his admiration of the girls. 
</P>
<P>
	``What he's describing is totally a male fantasy. Amsterdam's  
red light district looks like a tough day on the job to me,'' she 
said in the Times interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaster bodies are castings of friends that Kienholz and his  
wife borrowed during the 1984-88 construction of the work. 
</P>
<P>
	Pincus said the couple inspired his master's thesis, doctoral  
dissertation and book, ``On a Scale That Competes With the World: 
The Art of Edward and Nancy Reddin Kienholz.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Nancy always said this was a piece that came primarily from  
him,'' Pincus said. ``His common thread always seemed to be an 
interest in people at the margins of society -- people society has 
seen as marginalized people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Hoerengracht'' is on display through June 27 at the Nevada  
Museum of Art. It is on loan by Nancy Reddin Kienholz and the 
Louver Gallery in Venice, Calif., which is its permanent home.

<HEADLINE> New Offer May Seek To Move Penguins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Pittsburgh inched closer Tuesday to joining  
Hartford, Winnipeg, Quebec and other cities that lost NHL teams 
with a new buyer's offer of $85 million to move the Pittsburgh 
Penguins. 
</P>
<P>
	NHL attorney Jeffrey Levitan revealed the offer during a hearing  
on the league's request for quick work on the fate of the team, 
which is in U.S. Bankruptcy Court proceedings for the second time 
in 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The buyer is believed to be Paul Allen, the Seattle billionaire  
who also owns the NFL's Seattle Seahawks and NBA's Portland Trail 
Blazers. The Penguins would provide another wintertime tenant for 
the Rose Garden in Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	NHL commissioner Gary Bettman would not confirm Allen's bid  
during a news conference minutes before the Maple Leafs-Penguins 
playoff game Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have not finalized or signed a deal with anyone,'' Bettman  
said. ``If there's speculation that's a done deal, I think people 
are getting ahead of themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bettman said the NHL remains firmly behind Hall of Famer Mario  
Lemieux's reorganization plan, but time is growing tight as 
planning already is underway for the 1999-2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are fully supportive of Mario's plan, but there are a  
variety of conditions that must be satisfied first,'' Bettman said, 
citing a renegotiated arena lease as the first priority. 
</P>
<P>
	SMG, which operates the Civic Arena, is not to blame for the  
Penguins' financial mess, Bettman said, but he cautioned that the 
Lemieux plan will not go through unless SMG renegotiates. The 
Penguins currently pay $5 million-$6 million a year to play in the 
38-year-old Civic Arena, the oldest in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	``This club is not viable in Pittsburgh without a new lease,''  
Bettman said. ``We would like to have the Pens reorganized in 
Pittsburgh, but if it (the Lemieux plan) fails, we have to look at 
alternatives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL also could liquidate the Penguins and disperse its  
players in a draft among the other league teams. But Bettman said 
that will occur only if the alternative owner decides he doesn't 
have enough time to market the Penguins in a new city for next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The new bid represents $35 million more than Lemieux's $50  
million cash bid endorsed by the NHL, so the team's 200 creditors 
stand to earn more from it. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Chuck Greenberg, Lemieux's attorney, said the  
assumption of debt by the Lemieux group will eventually make his 
bid more attractive. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not surprised that another party is interested in the  
team. There were a number of bidders who emerged the last time the 
league expanded,'' Greenberg said. ``We are not going to concern 
ourselves with what might happen if our bid is not confirmed. We 
want to put all our energies into making this a viable franchise in 
Pittsburgh.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The offer mentioned by Levitan is $30 million less than the  
recent reported price for the Tampa Bay Lightning, who finished at 
19-54-9 and unlike the Penguins missed this year's playoffs. But 
the Lightning plays in a nearly new arena, the Ice Palace, that is 
controlled by the team's new ownership. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial trouble and uncertainty about the looming season have  
reduced the Penguins' value, said William Daly, the league's vice 
president for legal affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are not ideal conditions under which to be selling a  
sports franchise,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A court and creditors' review of the NHL's plan to dissolve the  
Penguins has been scheduled for 11 a.m. May 19. 
</P>
<P>
	That is 12 days before the NHL's deadline for resolving Penguins  
ownership and the same day as Game 7, if necessary, in the current 
playoff series with Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly said the league wants to begin scheduling for next season  
and needs to know how many teams it will have and whether they will 
travel to Pittsburgh or another city for games. 
</P>
<P>
	The league is using the prospect of losing the team to push the  
Penguins toward Lemieux and his investors, although the tone of 
court proceedings has become more grave as the deadline nears. 
</P>
<P>
	``The longer it goes, the harder it is for the league,'' Bettman  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Las Vegas and Kansas City are among the other U.S. cities that  
have been trying to get hockey teams. Roger Marino, one of the 
Penguins' three owners along with Howard Baldwin and Morris 
Belzberg, traveled there and elsewhere to pitch the Penguins. 
</P>
<P>
	At the May 19 hearing, Judge Bernard Markovitz could schedule  
votes by creditors on the NHL's plan and the Lemieux bid, perhaps 
simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want our alternative plan put on the same track as the  
Lemieux plan,'' Bettman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest creditors, the Penguins' banks and insurers, and the  
NHL want the votes to happen at the same time. But other creditors 
object, saying that could be confusing. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge faulted the NHL for waiting so long to prepare its  
plan. Levitan said the league held back at first because it did not 
want to upset negotiations with prospective buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux, who is owed $26.2 million in deferred salary and is the  
Penguins' biggest unsecured creditor, is courting Broadcast.com 
founder Mark Cuban, a native of suburban Pittsburgh, as a potential 
investor. They met again on Tuesday afternoon, Greenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins' banks, insurers, equipment suppliers, bond  
holders, former players and other creditors are owed $125 million. 
The team lost $10 million last year and did not sell out recent 
home playoff games with New Jersey, though its first two home games 
against Toronto are sellouts. 
</P>
<P>
	The team's troubles stem from long-term deals that Baldwin,  
strapped for cash after losing $25 million during the 1994-95 
lockout season, signed with Fox Sports and SMG. He received money 
upfront that kept the team in business.

<HEADLINE> Jazz Cry Foul Over Webber's Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST VALLEY CITY, Utah (AP) -- Karl Malone has been in trouble  
more times than he can count for his zealously physical play. Now 
he's wondering why Chris Webber isn't in the same fix. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a double standard, without a doubt,'' Malone said.  
</P>
<P>
	Just nine seconds into Sacramento's 101-90 win over the Jazz on  
Monday night, Webber lowered his shoulder and slammed John Stockton 
to the floor, knocking the wind out of the much smaller guard. 
Webber was assessed a flagrant foul but nothing else, and he 
flattened Stockton again on a pick late in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	As Utah practiced Tuesday morning before traveling to Sacramento  
for Game 3, the Jazz -- and Malone in particular -- were still 
smarting from Webber's big hits. After the game, Webber admitted he 
had targeted Stockton for punishment while trying to set a physical 
tone. 
</P>
<P>
	``What if Karl Malone did that and said, `I tried to do that?'  
'' Malone said. ``What do you think the league would do?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Malone has been suspended twice in the last two seasons for his  
aggressive play. Most recently, a hard elbow to Joe Kleine's face 
split the Phoenix center's lip April 26 and required Kleine to get 
30 stitches and plastic surgery. Malone wasn't fined or suspended 
for the hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Webber or Charles Barkley, who admitted trying to hurt  
Stockton during the Rockets' first-round playoff loss to the Jazz 
last year, Malone said he has never set out to deliberately injure 
another team's player. His kind of contact is simply the result of 
physical, legal play. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're going to do that, hit a big guy,'' Malone said.  
``That's when you show you're a man. Don't hit a little guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rod Thorn, the NBA's senior vice president of operations, was  
traveling Tuesday and could not be contacted. It was not known if 
Thorn was reviewing the play, NBA spokesman Chris Brienza said. 
</P>
<P>
	Immediately after the game, Utah coach Jerry Sloan, a hard-nosed  
guard during 10 seasons with the Chicago Bulls, expressed a 
grudging admiration for Webber's move. But Sloan also had a 
different take on the incident after viewing tapes of the game 
Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``If that's something you have to do to play basketball, I think  
that's sad,'' Sloan said. ``If he'd done that to Karl Malone, I'd 
have tremendous respect for the guy ... but you don't take on a guy 
like that when he's so much smaller than you. That's the kind of 
stuff the league was going through with Dennis Rodman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stockton was uncharacteristically slow to get up after both  
hits. The 15-year veteran is well-known for his hard picks, and has 
endured accusations of dirty play as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not that I'm not used to getting knocked around,''  
Stockton said. ``This game isn't about whether you out-cheap-shot 
the other team, but if they want to play it that way, then that's 
their business. I'm not happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta's Dikembe Mutombo also has angered the Detroit Pistons  
with his liberal use of his elbows during their first-round playoff 
series. Mutombo and Malone have been among the players most often 
accused of dirty play in the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Malone stopped short of calling for retaliation against Webber  
but left little doubt the Jazz won't back down. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to say what I'm going to do,'' Malone said after  
a long pause. ``I'm going to go play the game, and whatever 
happens, happens. ... You can't allow someone to do that to our 
players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Similar words were said after Barkley clotheslined Stockton last  
season and the Jazz fell behind 2-1. Instead of retaliating, the 
Jazz got back at Houston by winning the final two games and 
advancing to the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're not going to do any good responding to something like  
that,'' Sloan said. ``I'm not looking for anybody to do anything 
crazy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Kings seemed to respond to Webber's tone-setting hit. After  
a 30-point blowout loss that opened the series, Sacramento led 
through most of Game 2 and held off the Jazz down the stretch with 
back-to-back hook shots from Webber. 
</P>
<P>
	Sloan blamed his own team's poor shooting and defense -- not  
Webber's hit -- for Utah's loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really think they would have played well without him doing  
that.''

<HEADLINE> German Central Bank To Get New Head </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BONN, Germany (AP) -- The German government nominated Ernst  
Welteke, a Bundesbank council member from the ruling Social 
Democrats, today as the central bank's next president. 
</P>
<P>
	He is to succeed Hans Tietmeyer as Bundesbank head and as  
Germany's member on the governing council of the European Central 
Bank on Sept. 1. Tietmeyer is retiring after nearly six years. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Bundesbank council members can comment on Welteke's  
nomination at a meeting Wednesday, but they do not have a formal 
veto. His appointment by President Roman Herzog is seen as certain. 
</P>
<P>
	Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Cabinet proposed Welteke at a  
meeting Tuesday, government spokeswoman Charima Reinhardt said. But 
his nomination has been expected in government circles for weeks 
since Finance Minister Hans Eichel took office in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Welteke, 56, served as finance minister in Hesse when Eichel was  
state governor and has maintained good relations with his former 
chief. 
</P>
<P>
	Relations between the government and the Bundesbank are expected  
to improve after the changes following repeated policy 
confrontations between left-wing former finance minister Oskar 
Lafontaine and Tietmeyer, a conservative named by ex-chancellor 
Helmut Kohl. 
</P>
<P>
	Welteke, considered a moderate leftist, has said one of his  
tasks will be trimming the bureaucracy at the Bundesbank, which has 
lost clout after 11 countries introduced the euro currency, 
overseen by the European Central Bank, on Jan. 1.

<HEADLINE> Books and Authors: Robert McNamara </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Did 58,000 Americans need to die in  
Vietnam? Or did Washington bungle opportunities to halt the sad 
procession of body bags? 
</P>
<P>
	Families of the fallen soldiers may be unsettled by answers  
offered by former U.S. Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara, a 
principle strategist of the war, in ``Argument Without End: In 
Search of Answers to the Vietnam Tragedy,'' published by Pacific 
Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	The book argues that leaders in Hanoi and Washington passed up  
many opportunities that could have averted war -- or lessened its 
carnage -- by making bad decisions or failing to communicate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both Washington and Hanoi could have accomplished their  
purposes without the appalling loss of life,'' writes McNamara, 
defense secretary from 1961 until 1968. 
</P>
<P>
	The American casualties were but a small fraction of 3.8 million  
North and South Vietnamese soldiers and civilians killed in the war 
that lasted from the mid-1960s to 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	``Argument Without End'' is the second book in which McNamara  
seeks to come to terms with what some called ``McNamara's War'' 
because of his dominant role in formulating the Johnson 
administration's strategies in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	In his 1995 memoirs, McNamara admitted that the policies were  
``terribly wrong,'' and that he had reached this conclusion by 
1967. That confession provoked outcry from American veterans, who 
said McNamara was wrong to let the war escalate when he knew U.S. 
policies were flawed. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the first book, the second is something of a McNamara mea  
culpa. It's also an exercise in soul-searching. 
</P>
<P>
	Now age 82, McNamara is in a way a victim of the war he helped  
wage. Many Vietnam vets hate him. But he is like them in one way: 
The war weighs heavily on his mind. 
</P>
<P>
	McNamara says he wrote the new book to identify mistakes made  
during the Vietnam War so similar errors won't be made in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wars between great and lesser powers ... are certain to  
occur,'' McNamara writes. ``But can we not reduce their severity by 
learning from history?'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNamara's search for answers led him to initiate a series of  
conferences in Hanoi with his old North Vietnamese foes, including 
Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap. Comments made by McNamara's erstwhile enemies 
in those discussions, held between November 1995 and February 1998, 
are used as pillars for his new book. 
</P>
<P>
	Retired Army Col. Harry Summers, who wrote a book about  
strategies used in the Vietnam War, thinks McNamara's quest for 
answers is actually a quest to find other shoulders on which to 
place blame for American deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's concerned about his legacy. He's trying to absolve  
himself and explain himself away,'' said Summers, who served two 
tours of duty in Vietnam and is editor of Vietnam Magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	``Argument Without End'' is co-authored by McNamara and Thomas  
Biersteker and James Blight of Brown University, Robert K. Brigham 
of Vassar College, and Herbert Schandler, a retired U.S. Army 
colonel who served three tours of duty in Vietnam and is now a 
professor at the National Defense University in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Relying on his own knowledge of the war era and on statements by  
former North Vietnamese officials who attended the 1995-98 
conferences in Hanoi, McNamara offers a litany of ``missed 
opportunities'' which he contends could have averted the war or 
ended it before it spun out of control:. 
</P>
<P>
	--In the late 1940s, Communist leader Ho Chi Minh sent ``many  
signals'' to Washington indicating he wanted peaceful relations, 
McNamara writes. Preoccupied with ending World War II and 
confronting the Soviet threat, McNamara says, Washington never 
responded. 
</P>
<P>
	--Washington wrongly perceived North Vietnam to be a pawn of the  
Soviets or the Chinese, McNamara says. 
</P>
<P>
	--Seeking to reclaim colonies in Indochina, France went to war  
against Ho Chi Minh's guerrillas in 1945. In 1950, the United 
States decided to provide financial support for France's war -- a 
``very, very costly mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--After the French defeat in 1954, an international conference in  
Geneva divided Vietnam into the Communist north and the 
pro-American south, and called for elections to be held in 1956 to 
reunify the country. The United States refused to endorse the 
election, fearing Ho Chi Minh's Communists would win. McNamara 
suggests Washington could have averted war had the elections gone 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	--Washington and Hanoi could have agreed on a neutral coalition  
government in Saigon at any time from 1961 to 1964, McNamara 
maintains, but a lack of communication resulted in them failing to 
understand that their goals for Vietnam were compatible. 
</P>
<P>
	--When Communist guerrillas attacked a South Vietnamese Army  
barracks at Pleiku on Feb. 7, 1965, killing eight Americans and 
wounding more than 100 others, the Communists didn't know U.S. 
soldiers were there. Had Washington known that at the time, the 
McNamara book suggests, the United States might have given more 
thought before launching ``Rolling Thunder,'' a massive bombing of 
North Vietnam that was a prelude to the ground war. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of these arguments have been made before. They have been  
countered by some observers who say Cold War pressures made the war 
inevitable, or that the war could have been won had restraints not 
been placed on the U.S. military.

	Daniel Ellsberg, famed leaker of the ``Pentagon Papers,'' said  
McNamara's book manages to overlook a crucial ``missed 
opportunity'': his failure to make a lot of noise in public about 
his own doubts the war could be won. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1967, McNamara wrote memos to President Lyndon Johnson  
voicing displeasure with the conduct of the war. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson disagreed, and McNamara left the Pentagon in 1968, but  
kept his opinions of the war to himself, apparently out of loyalty 
to Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	``He kept his mouth shut as guys on both sides died year after  
year,'' says Ellsberg.

<HEADLINE> Qualcomm-Ericsson Deal Gets Fed OK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- The U.S. Justice Department approved a deal to  
resolve a long-running patent dispute between Qualcomm Inc. and 
Swiss-based LM Ericsson Co., company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Approval of the deal between the rival telecommunications  
companies was unconditional, Ericsson spokeswoman Kathy Egan said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	That means San Diego-based Qualcomm can sell its money-losing  
infrastructure division to Ericsson in a couple of weeks, Qualcomm 
spokeswoman Christine Trimble said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1,200 of the division will transfer to Ericsson. Last  
week, some employees filed a class-action lawsuit claiming that the 
switch would deprive them of unvested stock options that could 
total millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Options usually are offered as hiring incentives and bonuses.  
They allow workers to buy stock at the current market price and 
then sell it after certain ``vesting'' dates. 
</P>
<P>
	Such arrangements can be extremely lucrative if -- as with  
Qualcomm -- the stock price soars. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Qualcomm announced that at least 94 percent of the  
1,053 division employees with unvested stock options had agreed to 
accept a bonus instead of joining the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The signup deadline was last Friday for the bonus, which will  
pay employees a percentage of the value of their unvested stock. 
The company has said workers could get anywhere from $20,000 to 
more than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are pleased with the overwhelming acceptance of the  
retention bonus plan,'' Irwin Jacobs, Qualcomm's chief executive, 
said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	That still leaves more than 60 workers who could join the suit,  
with potential damages of more than $30 million, said David 
Perkins, the lead attorney for the employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Perkins claimed Qualcomm pressured employees to take the bonus.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're also going to look into the possibility of duress on  
these employees,'' Perkins said. ``If they were pressuring 
employees to sign, then that's not legal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trimble said employees were given ample time to decide what they  
what they wanted to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not able to comment on speculation but I can tell you  
that they were presented the plan through meetings last month,'' 
she said.

<P>
	CHARLOTTE (AP) -- Paul Silas, who moved gracefully from a backup  
role to transform the Charlotte Hornets into a winning team, signed 
a $6 million contract Tuesday to coach the NBA club for the next 
four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Silas, 55, was an assistant when coach Dave Cowens resigned in  
March in a salary dispute. When Silas took over as interim coach, 
the team's record was 4-11. 
</P>
<P>
	Behind Silas, the Hornets put together a 22-13 record, including  
nine straight victories in one stretch, and missed making the NBA 
playoffs by one game. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was thrown into a situation where no one expected much,''  
said Hornets forward Anthony Mason, who has one year remaining on 
his contract. ``We share the same mentality, and we both want to 
win just as much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A popular choice among the Hornets players, Silas said he was  
surprised when he got a phone call last week from Hornets owner 
George Shinn, who asked to meet with him at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
	``I intended to come in with my best poker face for the  
negotiations,'' Silas said. ``But when I saw the offer, I broke 
into a big grin. I guess I blew it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The contract includes a guaranteed $4.5 million over three  
years, with an optional fourth year, according to media reports. 
The team did not disclose the terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Shinn, who recently ended negotiations to sell half-interest in  
the Hornets to Michael Jordan, said he was thrilled to sign Silas 
to a long-term contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``After Paul Silas took over as coach, something special  
happened to this team,'' he said. ``Of all the coaches that I have 
spoken to and seen work over the years, Paul has impressed me more 
with his desire to develop each player to their highest 
potential.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shinn left the news conference without taking any questions.  
</P>
<P>
	General manager Bob Bass described Silas as tenacious.  
</P>
<P>
	``Seldom do you meet a man who never gave up,'' he said. ``He  
has had this dream, and he never gave it up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silas, who joined the team as an assistant in 1997, saved most  
of his praise for the players, whom he calls ``my guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This team has a chance to do some special things next year,''  
he said. ``To me, it was nothing short of a miracle what this team 
did this year, missing the playoffs by an inch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silas said he hoped to keep the same team together so they could  
become one of the NBA's elite clubs. 
</P>
<P>
	``These guys really gave it to me,'' he said. ``They worked hard  
every night and never dogged it. I look forward to coaching this 
team a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silas guided the old San Diego Clippers to a 78-168 mark in  
three seasons as coach immediately after completing a 16-year NBA 
career. Silas also was an assistant with New Jersey, New York and 
Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	He acknowledged that it was critical for the front office to  
sign Mason and Eddie Jones, who also could become a free agent 
after next year. Another need is a backup at point guard, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They stepped up to the plate for me so I don't see why they  
won't do it for the players,'' Silas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mason, who missed the entire season with a ruptured biceps  
tendon, wasn't ready to show his hand. Asked if he believed the 
Hornets were willing to spend the money to keep him, he responded: 
``We shall see.''

<HEADLINE> Japan Auto Import Sales Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Hurt by the continuing recession, sales of imported  
cars, trucks and buses in Japan slipped 0.6 percent on year in 
April, an industry group reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Total import sales in April amounted to 19,962 vehicles, down  
from 20,084 the same month a year ago -- the second straight monthly 
drop, the Japan Automobile Importers Association said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of imported passenger cars jumped 1.8 percent to 19,382,  
but truck imports plummeted 44.6 percent to 579. One imported bus 
was sold in April, the same as last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Kunihiko Ono, a spokesman for the association, said imported  
vehicle sales were likely to remain weak amid few signs of a 
significant economic recovery in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercedes-Benz was the leading import brand in April for the  
sixth straight month. Mercedes-Benz had a 21 percent share of the 
import market, followed by Volkswagen with 16 percent and BMW with 
9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	By country, sales of passenger cars imported from Germany rose  
5.5 percent to 11,065. Mercedes sales increased 40.6 percent to 
3,949, Opel sales grew 3.1 percent to 1,383 and German-made Ford 
sales soared 183.6 percent to 431. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of U.S.-made passenger cars rose 24.2 percent to 4,363,  
with Ford sales rising 2.6 percent to 240 and Honda sales soaring 
371.1 percent to 1,630. 
</P>
<P>
	Ono said Ford's April sales were boosted by demand for its  
recently introduced three-door hatchback, the ``Ka,'' while Honda 
continued to benefit from strong demand for its Inspire and Saber 
luxury sedans. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of other U.S.-made passenger cars fell, however, with  
DaimlerChrysler's sales slumping 39.7 percent, GM's dropping 8.8 
percent and Toyota's plunging 52.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of passenger cars from Britain dropped 15.2 percent.

<HEADLINE> Baffert's Preakness Decision Easy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Bob Baffert intends to let the luck determine  
whether he runs fillies Silverbulletday and Excellent Meeting in 
the Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
	If Monday's workout means anything, then Baffert's decision on  
Silverbulletday will be an easy one. 
</P>
<P>
	After the filly covered five furlongs in an impressive 59  
seconds at Churchill Downs, Baffert said, ``I figured after she 
worked they'd have to put water on the track to cool it down. 
That's what you want to see coming into a race like the 
Preakness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both fillies are entered in Friday's Black-Eyed Susan, where  
Silverbulletday drew the rail and Excellent Meeting received the 
fourth position. If they get anywhere near that kind of placement 
in Wednesday's Preakness draw, Baffert will saddle both for 
Saturday's middle jewel of the Triple Crown. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fate will decide whether we run or not,'' Baffert said.  
``These are two great fillies and I'm not going to waste a (start). 
I want to run to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday has won 10 of 11 career races, including the  
Kentucky Oaks. Excellent Meeting, fifth in the Kentucky Derby, was 
to work out this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	In other news, the trainer of First American pulled his horse  
from the Preakness, citing a pair of injuries. The colt, who took 
16th in the Derby, has been bothered by fluid in his lungs and 
developed a bone chip in his ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very disappointed. When we decided to make this trip, we  
thought he would be in good shape,'' trainer Eduardo Caramori said. 
``The lung wasn't clear for the Derby and still isn't great, and 
the first sign that the ankle was bothering him came yesterday. 
With that combination, we have to pull out. You can't go into a big 
race at less than 100 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The departure of First American leaves the stakes barn at  
Pimlico near empty. Although most of the entrants plan to arrive 
Wednesday, trainer Nick Zito shipped his two horses, Stephen Got 
Even and Adonis, last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a lot easier for a trainer and his staff to stay in one  
place and ship in at the last minute,'' Zito conceded. ``I feel 
that if you come here and get used to the racetrack, it should mean 
something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His strategy worked to perfection in 1996, with upset winner  
Louis Quatorze. Zito is counting on similar results this year, even 
though both of his entrants finished far back in the Kentucky 
Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were right in '96 and hopefully we'll be right in '99,'' he  
said. ``If they do well Saturday, we'll be vindicated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zito was among the first arrivals at Pimlico three years ago,  
and his judgment appeared justified when Louis Quatorze charged 
past Skip Away and paid $19 to win. 
</P>
<P>
	If Stephen Got Even or Adonis win Saturday, it was also be  
considered a surprise. Stephen Got Even is coming off a 14th-place 
finish at the Derby, and Adonis took 17th place. 
</P>
<P>
	``They deserved the right to be in the Derby. But they had  
traffic problems and didn't have the best of trips,'' Zito said. 
``Hopefully, they'll have better luck here.''

<HEADLINE> Last Cop-Hiring Subsidies Announced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Announcing grants to reach a goal of putting  
100,000 new police officers on the street, President Clinton 
planned Wednesday to ask Congress to toughen penalties for misuse 
of biological agents that can be used as weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has made his commitment to put 100,000 more cops on the  
street through federal subsidies a hallmark of his administration. 
Although the actual number of new officers is running behind the 
number funded, administration officials were treating the latest 
round of grants as a milestone. 
</P>
<P>
	As he presents $95 million in grants for the last 1,500  
officers, Clinton planned to push Congress to renew the community 
policing program for five years and embrace his crime package, 
especially its initiatives aimed at cutting juvenile violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also planned to unveil legislation to toughen penalties  
for unauthorized possession of harmful biological agents like 
anthrax and hold certified handlers of such materials accountable 
for their misuse, an administration officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It essentially bans the possession of these agents for other  
than peaceful purposes and makes the unsafe handling of them a 
crime as well,'' said the official, speaking on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the 526 grants being announced Wednesday, officials said,  
were $2.3 million to hire 30 new officers for the Miami-Dade Public 
Schools police in Florida; $1.5 million to hire 20 new officers in 
Raleigh, N.C.; $1.9 million for 20 new officers in Fairfax, Va., 
and $1.6 million for 21 new officers in Irvington, N.J. A 
half-dozen towns in Puerto Rico were receiving funds for 137 new 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have accused the administration of failing to make  
good on the 100,000 cops pledge. And a recent Justice Department 
Inspector General's report said several state and local police 
agencies had used the grants to supplant -- rather than supplement -- 
state and local funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials said that there is a lag of up to 18  
months between the time an agency receives the funds and when a new 
trainee is ready to hit the streets, claim Clinton can boast of 
more than 50,000 new officers already on the beat. 
</P>
<P>
	There is also some flexibility for police agencies who want to  
use funds to upgrade communications and other gear in order to free 
up officers for patrols. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Cerda of the White House domestic policy team said the  
agencies investigated by the Justice Department's inspector general 
represented less than 1 percent of the recipients and were singled 
out for review because of administration suspicions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every indication from the Justice Department, from surveys  
that they conduct regularly, is that every six months there are 
more cops on the street,'' Cerda said. ``The program is working 
well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton wants to extend the community policing program. He would  
spend $1.3 billion annually to help local governments to continue 
to hire more police, buy bulletproof vests and improved 
communications gear, hire more prosecutors and engage more closely 
with schools and community leaders.

<HEADLINE> Veto Threatened on Kosovo Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House-Senate negotiators hoping to ship  
President Clinton legislation this week paying for the fight with 
Yugoslavia, aid to Central America and other items are facing a new 
veto threat from the White House. But it seems likely that such a 
confrontation will be avoided. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers from the two chambers planned to meet this afternoon  
to begin crafting a compromise, multibillion-dollar package. But 
Monday evening, White House officials threatened for the first time 
to veto it, citing a host of objections. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, the administration had threatened to veto a  
stand-alone aid measure for Central America and U.S. farmers 
because it would cut domestic programs and add environmental and 
other items the White House opposes. They had also complained about 
-- but not threatened to veto -- a separate bill in which the House 
more than doubled Clinton's $6 billion request for the fight over 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, however, White House officials warned that the new,  
blended legislation was in danger of being rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a number of very troubling issues ... and the  
president's senior advisors would continue to recommend that he 
veto this legislation unless the objectionable provisions are 
resolved in a satisfactory manner,'' said a letter to House leaders 
from White House budget chief Jacob Lew. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked specifically about the extra House-approved defense funds,  
Lew said in an interview, ``It's important to scale it back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Members of both parties have said privately that they don't  
think Clinton would veto the Kosovo package as long as it is kept 
at roughly the $13 billion range the House approved last week. 
Congressional bargainers seem likely to pare it back even further, 
perhaps to about $10 billion, said participants who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	These officials say that with American troops in the field and  
with Clinton himself saying the Pentagon needs more money, he would 
be hard-pressed to reject such a measure. 
</P>
<P>
	The extra money the House added was for U.S. military operations  
and installations around the world, and a pay raise for the troops. 
The most likely item to be dropped is $1 billion the House added to 
modernize U.S. bases overseas, aides say. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really haven't settled anything yet,'' House Appropriations  
Committee Chairman Bill Young, R-Fla., said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	On Feb. 16, Clinton requested nearly $1 billion to help Honduras  
and other Central American nations devastated by last autumn's 
deadly Hurricane Mitch. He later asked for $152 million to help 
U.S. farmers hurt by record-low prices for wheat, corn and other 
farm products. 
</P>
<P>
	On March 23, the Senate approved a $2.5 billion bill for Central  
America and farmers, which included aid they had added for the U.S. 
steel, oil, gas and mining industries. The next day, the House 
approved a $1.3 billion version without the Senate add-ons. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration objections include Senate language that would bar  
the federal government from sharing in the $246 billion settlement 
states have won from the tobacco industry, delay increases in 
royalties oil companies pay for using federal lands and postpone 
stricter requirements for hardrock mining on government property. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House also opposes GOP plans to pay for the Central  
America aid with cuts in food stamps, along with money the United 
States uses to back loans by international lending agencies and 
other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration prefers using this year's expected federal  
surplus. Many aides from both parties, however, believe a 
compromise will be reached on spending reductions.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Workers To Get a Raise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REDMOND, Wash. (AP) -- Microsoft Corp., known among other things  
for producing ``Microsoft millionaires'' and having a chairman 
often listed as the world's richest man, has decided it doesn't pay 
its employees enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning Aug. 1, pay rates will be boosted to the 65th  
percentile of pay in the software industry nationwide, company 
spokesman Dan Leach said. Microsoft's pay rates have been at the 
50th percentile for the past 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's largest software manufacturer also said it would  
increase the number of non-executive job classifications from 12 to 
22, to make promotions more frequent among its 30,200 employees, 
including 16,000 in the Puget Sound area.

	Microsoft wouldn't say exactly how the pay-raise move would  
translate into dollars for an average employee. But figures 
compiled by the research company Data Masters of Greensboro, N.C., 
indicate how the changes might work out: 
</P>
<P>
	--The average salary for a senior software engineer ranges from  
$70,000 in the Southwest to $77,500 on the West Coast. The same 
employee in the 75th percentile -- 10 percentage points higher than 
Microsoft's new level -- would earn $87,700 or $87,300, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	--The median salary for an object-oriented software developer  
ranges from $60,200 in the Southwest and $73,900 in the Northeast. 
At the 75th percentile, that worker would earn $83,900 or $95,200, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Leach said Microsoft's employee recruiting is on target to meet  
its goals, and said the company's attrition rate is 7 percent, less 
than half the industry's standard. 
</P>
<P>
	But Microsoft's vice president of human resources, Chris  
Williams, has said the company is trying to remain competitive. In 
part, that means the company has to come up with compensation 
packages that take into account the fact that Microsoft stock's 
growth has slowed, which means the stock options that made 
``Microsoft millionaires'' in years past are no longer as valuable. 
</P>
<P>
	Leach wouldn't say how much the pay changes would cost, but ``it  
won't have much impact -- it's not expected to be huge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft has $22 billion in cash and no debt.

<HEADLINE> CIA Explains What Went Wrong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The CIA had the right address when it proposed  
that NATO bomb a Yugoslav munitions bureau. But the agency couldn't 
correctly locate that address on a map of Belgrade, and the point 
it selected turned out to be the Chinese Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
	Two grim-faced U.S. intelligence officials delivered that  
extraordinary message to lawmakers in a closed-door session and 
then to reporters Monday as the diplomatic storm between Beijing 
and Washington swirled all around. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the right address applied to the wrong building,'' one  
of the officials said. The other said, ``None of the fail-safes 
worked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They met reporters on condition their names not be used.  
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen cited two key errors made by the  
CIA and missed by the Pentagon and NATO strike planners. 
</P>
<P>
	First, the spy agency failed to correctly pinpoint the target,  
the Yugoslav Federal Directorate for Supply and Procurement, on its 
maps. The directorate was a few hundred yards down the street from 
the site actually bombed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Second, the building that they did target turned out to be the  
Chinese Embassy, but their maps incorrectly located the embassy in 
a different part of Belgrade,'' Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	The CIA was working with a map dating to 1992 and made by the  
Defense Mapping Agency, a Pentagon organization now called the 
National Imagery and Mapping Agency. The map shows individual 
buildings in Belgrade but no specific street numbers. And despite 
two updates to the map done in 1997 and 1998, the map still showed 
the Chinese Embassy in its former location in the old section of 
Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese moved their embassy in 1996. The U.S. diplomatic  
mission in Belgrade was aware of the move, but a State Department 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the mission 
officials did not consider it their responsibility to notify U.S. 
and allied strike planners. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, the allied ``no strike'' list, a tally of churches,  
schools, hospitals and embassies that NATO strives to avoid as it 
pounds away at Yugoslavia, was outdated. 
</P>
<P>
	This paper error turned into disaster when the CIA, in  
recommending a strike on the procurement directorate, made a 
mistake when it tried to extrapolate the location of the arms 
directorate. The agency used known street addresses nearby, along 
with aerial imagery that showed a walled compound that fit 
intelligence information about the directorate's function as an 
arms supplier and exporter. 
</P>
<P>
	A missing ingredient was an agent on the ground in Belgrade  
actually looking at the prospective target because no agent was 
available. 
</P>
<P>
	A single B-2 bomber loaded with satellite-guided bombs attacked  
the compound Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior intelligence official described confusion, then shock  
and dismay at CIA headquarters and the Pentagon when they first 
learned that the Chinese Embassy had been bombed. The initial guess 
was that a bomb or missile had gone astray. 
</P>
<P>
	When the news that the embassy had been struck broke Friday  
night, ``We started looking, 'Where's (the Chinese Embassy) at?. Oh 
my gosh, it's the target,'' the intelligence official said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the strike, bewildered CIA officials still could find no  
document in their files giving the correct location of the Chinese 
Embassy, even though it was common knowledge in Belgrade and among 
the diplomatic community. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident has raised questions about the CIA's role in target  
planning. Knowledgeable U.S. officials speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the agency only occasionally picks targets. One of 
the few instances that gained attention occurred last summer when 
the CIA recommended an attack on a target in Sudan that turned out 
to be a pharmaceutical plant and that may or may not have been 
involved in chemical weapons production. 
</P>
<P>
	John Pike of the Federation of American Scientists said U.S.  
intelligence is lagging in developing the kind of 
building-by-building information strike planners need in today's 
combat environment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our style of war increasingly involves targeting individual  
buildings,'' said Pike, whose Washington-based group follows 
intelligence issues. ``I don't believe our intelligence community 
is currently focused on that requirement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But intelligence experts said the business of identifying and  
locating a specific building in enemy territory is far more complex 
than it sounds. In places like Baghdad and Belgrade, the CIA and 
Pentagon must constantly update lengthy databases showing potential 
targets and places to avoid. Cohen announced new steps to do a 
better job at this tedious but critical work. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on the reaction from Capitol Hill, the CIA may parlay one  
of its worst mistakes into a budget increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., chairman of the Senate Intelligence  
Committee, called the bombing ``a serious intelligence failure,'' 
but he said it is ``indicative of what happens when you ask too few 
people to do too much.'' Years of intelligence budget cuts, he 
said, ``have stretched our people to the breaking point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the difficulties involved, even military professionals  
were aghast at the error. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's incredible at this stage of the game that they don't have  
up-to-date maps,'' said Bernard Trainor, a retired general and 
co-author of a book on the Persian Gulf War.

<HEADLINE> G.O.P. Trains Sights on Bradley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican Party, citing internal polls  
that suggest Vice President Al Gore is vulnerable in the Democratic 
primary, is turning its attention to Gore rival Bill Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	A memo written by David Israelite, the Republican National  
Committee's director of political and governmental affairs, says 
Gore's poll numbers are down and Bradley's are up. The memo to RNC 
chairman Jim Nicholson also says Gore's unfavorable rating ``is at 
a high 23 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on this most recent confirmation of what our earlier  
research has indicated, I have directed our research department to 
shift its focus to Bill Bradley a full 50 percent of the time. We 
will continue to monitor the situation,'' Israelite wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``Agreed,'' Nicholson said in a handwritten reply. ``Do it!''  
</P>
<P>
	A copy of the May 4 memo was obtained Monday by The Associated  
Press. 
</P>
<P>
	With Gore the early favorite to win the Democratic nomination,  
Republicans are eager to portray him as a weak candidate. The memo 
may be part of that strategy, but it also reflects the results of 
some public opinion polls that showed a shrinking gap between Gore 
and Bradley, a former New Jersey senator. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Gore holds a lead of 20 or more percentage points in most  
polls, and at least one public survey suggests that the vice 
president has regained some of the lost ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's campaign dismissed the memo.  
</P>
<P>
	``This must be the RNC's version of trickle down negative  
politics,'' spokesman Roger Salazar said. ``It's too bad they can't 
spend some of those resources coming up with good policy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whether genuinely concerned or not about Bradley's chances, the  
RNC is starting to treat Bradley as a serious candidate: The 
party's spokesman attacked him Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without looking in depth yet, I would say the fact that Bill  
Bradley's biggest accomplishment in the Senate was losing the fight 
against welfare reform is significant,'' said RNC communications 
director Cliff May. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley has expressed concern about the impact welfare reform  
has on poor Americans. Gore supported President Clinton's decision 
to sign the 1996 welfare overhaul bill. 
</P>
<P>
	May also noted that Bradley voted against President Reagan's  
nomination of Alan Greenspan as Federal Reserve chairman. Greenspan 
is given high marks by Democrats and Republicans for his role in 
improving the nation's economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser said the former senator had  
questioned Greenspan's international experience during the first 
confirmation hearing, but voted for Greenspan when he was 
re-nominated. 
</P>
<P>
	``His worries have proven unfounded,'' Hauser said.  
</P>
<P>
	Even with GOP pollsters still in the field last month, RNC chief  
of staff Tom Cole predicted that the party would train its sites on 
Bradley. The Israelite memo put the new policy in motion.

	NATO Attacks Continue in Yugoslavia  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO continued its airstrikes on  
Yugoslavia today and Serb media said at least seven people were 
killed in the attacks. The strikes continued as NATO said there was 
no evidence Yugoslavia had withdrawn any of the estimated 40,000 
troops and special police from the Kosovo. In Washington, Defense 
Secretary William Cohen said NATO will accept nothing less than a 
total withdrawal of forces from Kosovo as part of its conditions to 
halt the air campaign. 

</P>
<P>
	China Drops Demand of U.N. Council  
</P>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- China dropped its demand Tuesday that the  
Security Council condemn NATO's bombing of its Belgrade embassy, 
but warned again it wouldn't discuss a Kosovo peace plan until the 
alliance stops attacking Yugoslavia. The bombing incident has 
soured U.S.-China relations and threatens to complicate a 
diplomatic solution to the conflict. As a permanent, veto-wielding 
member of the Council, China must support any resolution codifying 
a peace plan. China has said that the chief condition for peace 
talks was an end to the NATO airstrikes. 

</P>
<P>
	CIA Error May Yield Budget Increase  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The CIA may well see one of its biggest  
blunders turn into a budget boost. On Capitol Hill today, Sen. Ted 
Stevens, R-Alaska, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, 
asked Defense Secretary William Cohen whether the mistaken bombing 
of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade stemmed from overworked 
intelligence analysts with underfunded information databases. Many 
lawmakers have reacted to the bombing error by talking about 
pumping more money into the U.S. intelligence system. The Clinton 
administration is seeking about $29 billion for intelligence 
programs in the 2000 budget, an increase of about 9 percent. 

</P>
<P>
	Republicans Restate Tax-Cut Pledge  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans used today's symbolic ``Tax  
Freedom Day'' to renew their promise to pass tax relief in Congress 
this year. The Tax Foundation calculates ``Tax Freedom Day'' as the 
time it takes Americans on average to finish paying all federal, 
state and local taxes each year and begin working for themselves. 
This year's date is 131 days into 1999, one day later than last 
year. Republicans are trying to put together a tax relief bill that 
would eventually grow to nearly $800 billion over the next decade. 

</P>
<P>
	Ex-Welfare Recipients Studied  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Most Americans who have been swept from  
welfare rolls have jobs and earn more than they got from the 
government -- but not enough to escape poverty. That's the picture 
painted by 21 state studies that, after much speculation, provide 
the first glimpse of what has happened to the millions who have 
left welfare amid tough new rules and unprecedented economic 
growth. While homelessness and other worst-case scenarios are rare, 
a substantial number of these families face hardships, such as 
trouble paying for food and utility bills, an Associated Press 
review of the studies shows.

his plans tomorrow to buy the top-rated Internet site Lycos, 
according to people close to the situation. Diller had planned to 
create a company worth $22 billion by combining Lycos with his Home 
Shopping Network and Ticketmaster Online-Citysearch Inc., a ticket 
agency and online entertainment directory. But Diller couldn't win 
over small day traders who own a major stake in Lycos.

Ulihrach today in the Italian Open. Sampras, seeded second, 
committed 49 unforced errors to 11 for the tentative Ulihrach, but 
got past the Czech 3-6, 6-2, 7-6 (7-2). It was the American's first

<HEADLINE> Ex-POW Stone Attends Hockey Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- A day after a parade was held in his honor in  
Capac, Army Staff Sgt. Christopher Stone attended the Detroit Red 
Wings playoff game against the Colorado Avalanche on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone, wearing his Army uniform, was introduced to the crowd  
with 12:18 left in the first period. The crowd applauded as he 
waved from a luxury box and then held up a Red Wings shirt with the 
No. 1 and the name ``Stone'' on it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't say I feel like a hero. I just feel like I did my best  
and the homecoming I'm receiving is what everybody should get when 
they come home from something like that,'' Stone said during an 
interview on WKBD-TV during the second period. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone, bruised and battered during 32 days in captivity in  
Yugoslavia, said what kept him strong was: ``Faith in God, hope and 
a belief in my country and all the people I knew were supporting 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stone, who is from Smiths Creek in St. Clair County, was  
captured along with two soldiers under his command, Spc. Steven M. 
Gonzales, 22, and Staff Sgt. Andrew A. Ramirez, 25, along the 
Macedonia-Yugoslavia border on March 31. They were released May 2, 
when Yugoslav authorities handed the soldiers over to the Rev. 
Jesse Jackson, who had negotiated their release. 
</P>
<P>
	When Stone's father flew to Germany last week to see him for the  
first time since his release, he brought with him a Red Wings shirt 
with Brendan Shanahan's No. 14.

<HEADLINE> Columbia/HCA Spinoffs Complete </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp. completed  
its spinoff of 61 hospitals into two new publicly traded companies 
Tuesday, the latest step in an overhaul prompted by a 2-year-old 
federal fraud investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The spinoffs netted the nation's biggest hospital chain about  
$900 million, as each of the 61 hospitals paid for the right to be 
spun off. Columbia was left with 236 hospitals, down from a high of 
345 in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia shareholders on Tuesday received one share in each of  
the two independent companies for every 19 shares of Columbia stock 
held on April 30. 
</P>
<P>
	The new companies are Nashville-based Lifepoint Hospitals Inc.,  
which owns mostly rural hospitals, and Dallas-based Triad Hospitals 
Inc, which will operate mainly in medium-sized urban markets. 
Shares of both companies will begin trading on the Nasdaq stock 
market on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the spinoffs, Columbia will retain its title as  
nation's biggest hospital chain and have annual revenues of about 
$15 billion. But the spinoffs and other recent sales have left a 
more focused company that will ``get more bang for its buck,'' said 
Kemp Dolliver of SG Cowen Securities Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The spinoffs ``will allow management to focus more on its core  
operations,'' he said. And the hospitals that were spun off will 
get more attention and resources from their new management, he 
said, while continuing to utilize Columbia's data processing 
services and remaining in its purchasing network. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am absolutely convinced that this is one instance where one  
plus one plus one is equal to a whole lot more than three when the 
dust settles,'' Columbia vice president Vic Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
	While the spinoff is ``not the final step'' in the company's  
restructuring efforts, ``it is the last major piece,'' Campbell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	When Columbia was headed by the hard-charging Rick Scott, it  
grew at a staggering rate. Scott was forced out by the Columbia 
board because of his response to the investigation and replaced by 
Dr. Thomas Frist in July 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Frist vowed to concentrate on patient care instead of corporate  
growth and began selling off parts of the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Frist took over, the company has sold outright some 60  
hospitals and 40 to 50 surgery centers, as well as most of its home 
health care and benefits management businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia remains in settlement talks with the U.S. Justice  
Department, which has spent the past two years investigating 
whether Columbia overcharged Medicare, Medicaid and other 
government health programs. Four Columbia middle managers were 
indicted in Florida, and their trial began last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Lifepoint has 22 hospitals in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kansas,  
Kentucky, Louisiana, Tennessee, Utah and Wyoming. Triad includes 39 
hospitals and 19 surgery centers in Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, 
California, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, New Mexico, Oklahoma, 
Oregon and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Lifepoint plans to sell three of its hospitals, most of which  
are in rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Patients won't see much difference from ``the day before to the  
day after'' the spinoffs, Lifepoint CEO Scott Mercy said. ``But 
over the next 12 months, you'll see expanded services, and we've 
got a dedicated effort to recruit more physicians.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Triad plans to sell five of its 39 hospitals by the end of the  
year to reduce its $628 million debt load, said CEO James D. 
``Denny'' Shelton. Most of its hospitals are in urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
	LifePoint would have posted operating losses of $18 million on  
revenue of $498 million if independent last year, while Triad's 
losses would have been $86 million on revenue of $1.6 billion.

<HEADLINE> Lycos Shares Rise on USA Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Shares of Lycos Inc. soared 17 percent Monday as  
investors cheered reports that USA Networks is expected to abandon 
its plans to buy the Internet portal. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Diller, chairman and chief executive of USA Networks, has  
been stymied by investor opposition to his plans to combine Lycos 
with his Home Shopping Network and Ticketmaster City-Search Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Diller, however, hasn't reached a final decision, and still may  
decide to sweeten his bid, according to a report Monday in The Wall 
Street Journal, which cited bankers close to the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Both companies declined to comment on the report.  
</P>
<P>
	Since Diller made his offer for Lycos in February, the company's  
shares plummeted from $127 a share to as low as $73.87 1/2 as many 
investors rejected the prospect of joining with a non-internet 
company like USA Networks. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Lycos shareholders also didn't like the terms of the deal,  
where they would receive a 30 percent stake in the combined company 
and Diller's side would get the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	Lycos' stock rose $15.56 1/4 on Monday to $105.06 1/4 on the Nasdaq  
Stock Market. Shares of USA Networks fell 12 1/2 cents to $35.25, and 
Ticketmaster City-Search's stock rose $2.06 1/4 to $30.56 1/4, also on 
Nasdaq.

</P>
<P>
	On May 12th, 1949, the Soviet Union announced an end to the  
Berlin Blockade. 
</P>
<P>
	On this date:  
</P>
<P>
	In 1820, the founder of modern nursing, Florence Nightingale,  
was born in Florence, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1870, Manitoba entered Confederation as a Canadian province.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1932, the body of the kidnapped son of Charles and Anne  
Lindbergh was found in a wooded area of Hopewell, N.J. 
</P>

<P>
	In 1970, the Senate voted unanimously to confirm Harry A.  
Blackmun as a Supreme Court justice. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1975, the White House announced the new Cambodian government  
had seized an American merchant ship, the ``Mayaguez,'' in 
international waters. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1978, the Commerce Department said hurricanes would no longer  
be given only female names. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1982, in Fatima, Portugal, security guards overpowered a  
Spanish priest armed with a bayonet who was trying to reach Pope 
John Paul II. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years ago: The nation's largest airline computer reservation  
system, the American Airlines Sabre system, shut down for nearly 12 
hours, disrupting the operations of thousands of travel agencies 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years ago: The Senate joined the House in passing a bill

<HEADLINE> Furriers Fight 'Anti-Fur' Coat Tags </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Furriers in this well-heeled city  
are optimistic that voters will reject a measure that would require 
merchants to attach tags to coats and stoles explaining how the 
animals died. 
</P>
<P>
	Measure A is the only issue on today's ballot, and many  
customers at Somper Furs are angry over the $60,000 the city is 
spending on the special election, said store manager Douglas Fine. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal is ``one more attempt by the extreme animal  
activists to generate publicity to hurt the fur industry,'' Fine 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The credit card-sized tags on fur products costing over $50  
would tell would-be buyers that the pelts came from animals that 
may have been electrocuted, gassed, poisoned, clubbed, stomped, 
drowned or caught in steel-jaw leg traps, or had their necks 
broken. Violators could be fined $100 per item. 
</P>
<P>
	The ordinance would exempt fur makers who use humane methods,  
such as lethal injection administered by a licensed veterinarian. 
</P>
<P>
	Some famous residents including Jack Lemmon, Sid Caesar and  
Larry King are among backers of the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
	The leader of the group which has spent $75,000 to push the  
initiative said Monday the issue is consumer rights, not animal 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``The retailers have been caught misleading consumers by telling  
them the animals are put to sleep just like dogs and cats,'' said 
Luke Montgomery, campaign manager of Beverly Hills Consumers for 
Informed Choice. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters sent a videotape to 5,000 voters showing hidden  
camera excerpts of local fur merchants claiming the deaths were 
humane. 
</P>
<P>
	The City Clerk expects a big turnout despite the lack of any  
other matter on the ballot. More than 5,500 of the city's 20,000 
registered voters requested absentee ballots, more than double the 
absentee ballot request for most elections, City Clerk Nina Udy 
said. By Monday, 3,400 absentee votes were returned. 
</P>
<P>
	If fur products can be targeted, how about leather, which begins  
as an animal hide, too, furrier Fine wondered. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the next step,'' said Rudy Cole, campaign manager for  
the No on A Committee. ``This is the opening gun in the efforts by 
extremist animal rights activists. 
</P>
<P>
	``In many ways, fur harvesting is more regulated and humane than  
processing for food or anything else,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A reluctant City Council voted 3-1 Feb. 2, with one abstention,  
to call the initiative election, having been forced to put the 
measure on the ballot because 3,300 registered voters had signed a 
petition on the matter. Mayor Les Bronte was the lone dissenting 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't need a pelt posse here,'' Bronte said at the time.

<HEADLINE> Bush Picks Iowa Press Aide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush has picked  
veteran political operative Eric Woolson to head his communications 
operations in Iowa, aides said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got a good reputation in Iowa,'' said Bush aide Mindy  
Tucker. ``He's dealt with the press and in politics for a long 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woolson was spokesman for former Gov. Terry Branstad, and worked  
as a journalist in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	The move is yet another expansion of Bush's effort in Iowa,  
where precinct caucuses next February launch the presidential 
nominating season. The leader in most of the early polls, Bush has 
yet to visit the state but has won the endorsement of the state's 
GOP delegation in Congress and many in the Republican 
establishment. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has picked Des Moines lawyer Joe Gunderson to chair his  
Iowa campaign; veteran activist Luke Roth will run it on a 
day-to-day basis. 
</P>
<P>
	Woolson is a familiar figure in the state's political scene.  
He's interspersed a career in journalism with a series of political 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a political reporter for the Waterloo Courier before  
becoming a spokesman for Sen. Joe Biden when Biden unsuccessfully 
sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 1988.

<HEADLINE> Columbine Yearbook Honors Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- This year's Columbine High School  
yearbook features a special insert honoring the victims of the 
massacre at the school. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine students began picking up their yearbooks Monday. The  
yearbook shows the senior pictures of Eric Harris and Dylan 
Klebold, who killed 12 classmates and a teacher inside the school 
April 20 before taking their own lives. It also has a special 
insert remembering the slain students and teacher. 
</P>
<P>
	Senior Megan Fasano was among the students who picked up a  
yearbook Monday night at a church near the still-closed school. She 
and her friends gave the yearbook -- called Rebelations for the 
school's team name, the Rebels -- a quick glance to see the photos 
of Harris and Klebold. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to see Dylan's and Eric's face,'' Ms. Fasano said.  
</P>
<P>
	Another senior, Lesley Pech, objected to the photos.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think they should have their photos in the yearbook,''  
she said. ``They look happy and innocent, but it's them who ruined 
everything.'' But Terra Oglesbee, a senior who had classes with 
Harris, said the two deserve photos because ``they were students. 
They were people, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While their senior pictures are included, the two are not  
pictured in the special four-page memorial supplement. It has 
pictures of their 13 victims with their names and birthdates. 
</P>
<P>
	The front has the words ``We are still Columbine'' and a picture  
of the flower that gives the school its name. On the back, the 
lyrics of ``Columbine, Friend of Mine,'' the song written in memory 
of the tragedy, are superimposed on a picture of the school. 
</P>
<P>
	The yearbook club had the option of stopping publication of the  
book after the rampage, but opted to go ahead. The main book, 
featuring a solid red cover, was essentially completed in February. 
The club added one insert with pictures of the prom and other 
activities that took place since February and another for those 
killed in the rampage. 
</P>
<P>
	``The staff didn't want to start all over,'' said Eric Friesen,  
an English teacher who is yearbook director at Columbine. 
</P>
<P>
	Friesen said he expects about 90 percent of Columbine's 1,900  
students to buy this year's book, about the same percentage as in 
previous years. For some of those students, seeing pictures of 
their slain friends will be bittersweet. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels different and weird to look at a yearbook now,'' Ms.  
Fasano said.

<HEADLINE> Kid's Author Shel Silverstein Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Shel Silverstein began as a writer and cartoonist  
for Playboy magazine. He was an Oscar-nominated composer, creating 
popular country, pop and folk music. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was his poetry collections and silly characters that  
thrilled children and brought him the most fame. 
</P>
<P>
	The author of ``A Light in the Attic'' and ``Where the Sidewalk  
Ends'' was found dead in his apartment Monday in Key West, where he 
had lived since 1978. He was 66. 
</P>
<P>
	Two cleaning women discovered Silverstein's body in a bedroom of  
his home. An autopsy showed he died of a massive heart attack, 
possibly as early as Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a devastating loss. I'm numb,'' said longtime friend and  
lawyer Sheldon Vidibor. 
</P>
<P>
	Vidibor described him as ``the sweetest brightest man that I  
know, good to everybody, loyal, loving. He's a wonderful person, a 
wonderful human being. It goes without saying incredibly 
talented.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silverstein's self-illustrated books are packed with colorful  
characters like walruses with braces and camels in brassieres. His 
light, irreverent poetry entertained children and adults. 
</P>
<P>
	But adults only were his first target. He began as a cartoonist  
for the Pacific Stars and Stripes while in the Army in Japan and 
Korea, and then wrote and drew cartoons for Playboy magazine in the 
1950s. 
</P>
<P>
	``Uncle Shelby's ABZ Book,'' published in Playboy in 1961,  
satirizes cloying children's books with such entries as ``T is for 
TV,'' which urges readers to break open the television ``and you 
will see all the cowboys and Yogi Bear and Shirley Temple and 
Huckleberry Hound and EVERYBODY! Wowee!!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sardonic humor reappeared in Silverstein's music, which  
included ``Cover of the Rolling Stone,'' recorded by Dr. Hook, and 
the Johnny Cash hit ``A Boy Named Sue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The song tells of a man reunited in a bar with the father who  
named and then abandoned him. The resulting fight ends with the 
father explaining that he named his son Sue to make sure the boy 
grew up strong in his absence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got all choked up and I threw down my gun  
</P>
<P>
	And I called him my pa, and he called me his son,  
</P>
<P>
	And I come away with a different point of view.  
</P>
<P>
	And I think about him, now and then,  
</P>
<P>
	Every time I try and every time I win,  
</P>
<P>
	And if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him ...  
</P>
<P>
	Bill or George! Anything but Sue! I still hate that name!''  
</P>
<P>
	Silverstein's song ``I'm Checkin' Out,'' written for the Meryl  
Streep film ``Postcards from the Edge,'' was nominated for an 
Academy Award and a Golden Globe in 1991 as best original song in a 
motion picture. 
</P>
<P>
	But his children's stories were arguably his most popular work.  
The books included ``The Giving Tree'' (1964), ``Falling Up'' 
(1996), ``Where the Sidewalk Ends'' (1974), ``A Light in the 
Attic'' (1981) and ``The Missing Piece'' (1976). 
</P>
<P>
	``The Giving Tree'' celebrates 35 years in publication this  
fall. Silverstein won numerous awards for his work, including the 
Michigan Young Readers Award for ``Where the Sidewalk Ends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the poem ``Hug O' War'' from ``Where the Sidewalk Ends,''  
Silverstein describes his favorite game: 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd rather play at hug o' war,  
</P>
<P>
	Where everyone hugs  
</P>
<P>
	Instead of tugs,  
</P>
<P>
	Where everyone giggles  
</P>
<P>
	And rolls on the rug,  
</P>
<P>
	Where everyone kisses,  
</P>
<P>
	And everyone grins,  
</P>
<P>
	And everyone cuddles,  
</P>
<P>
	And everyone wins.''  
</P>
<P>
	``I would hope that people, no matter what age, would find  
something to identify with in my books, pick up one and experience 
a personal sense of discovery,'' Silverstein said told Publisher's 
Weekly in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's great. But for them, not for me. I think that if you're  
a creative person, you should just go about your business, do your 
work and not care about how it's received.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his 15-year-old son, Mathew.

<HEADLINE>  Chung Testifies Before House Panel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Weaving a tale of intrigue, fund-raiser Johnny  
Chung testified Tuesday he took $300,000 from a Chinese 
intelligence official who wanted to re-elect President Clinton. He 
alleged he later was offered hush money to discourage his 
cooperation with the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung, who once compared his donations to subway tokens that  
bought him entry into the White House and was dismissed by national 
security officials as a ``hustler,'' told lawmakers in his first 
public testimony that he never acted as an agent for the Chinese 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	And he testified he felt uncomfortable channeling the $300,000  
into political contributions, so he spent most of it on business 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
	But Chung testified he had contacts with the head of Chinese  
military intelligence, Gen. Ji Sheng De, who said he was eager to 
give money to help re-elect Clinton. And Chung detailed how a 
2 1/2-year political giving spree won him access to the White House 
for his well-heeled Chinese clients. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have mixed feelings about the president and the first lady,  
but I can't help but think that they used me as much as I used 
them,'' Chung told the House Government Reform and Oversight 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung also alleged that a U.S. Embassy official in Beijing, who  
has since left the State Department, helped him get visas for 
dozens who wanted to visit the United States. Chung alleged he did 
financial favors for the official, Charles Parish, and took him to 
a Democratic fund-raiser and a private tour of the first lady's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung said he ended his relationship with Parish after the  
president of a Chinese beer company asked him to deliver ``a 
shopping bag of money and visas'' to Parish. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department is investigating Parish, spokesman Maria  
Rudensky said Tuesday. She declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Parish, a 16-year State Department veteran, handled visa matters  
at the embassy from 1994 to 1996. He retired last year. He could 
not be reached for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats attacked Chung's credibility, accusing him of wrongly  
taking credit for the release of dissident Harry Wu from a Chinese 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Henry Waxman of California, the committee's senior  
Democrat, also scoffed at the notion that the money given to Chung 
was part of a Chinese conspiracy to influence the U.S. election. 
Waxman said it would have been a ``very strange way'' to run a 
conspiracy, since Chung spent most of the funds on personal items. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung became a cooperating witness in the federal investigation  
of campaign fund raising after pleading guilty to making illegal 
contributions to Clinton and other Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of Chung's story had been leaked prior to his testimony  
before the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee. But his 
appearance came at a sensitive time in U.S.-Chinese relations, 
which have been strained by the mistaken bombing of the Chinese 
Embassy in Yugoslavia and allegations that China stole U.S. nuclear 
secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	China denies trying to influence the U.S. elections or spying.  
</P>
<P>
	Chung disclosed Tuesday that after he began cooperating with the  
Justice Department, he was contacted by Robert Luu, a San Gabriel, 
Calif., businessman who claimed to make the approach on behalf of 
one of the Chinese officials whom Chung had previously worked with. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung said Luu first threatened that he should not cooperate  
with the FBI. ``The message was as follows: `If you keep your mouth 
shut, you and your family will be safe,''' he told lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung said Luu then introduced him to an attorney in San  
Gabriel, identified during the hearing as David Brockway, promising 
that the lawyer would take care of his legal problems and that Luu 
would pay his legal bills if he kept quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the conversations with Luu were photographed and  
recorded by FBI agents, who at one point placed Chung and his 
family in protective custody, Chung said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was told the attorney was connected and knew the No. 3  
person'' at the Justice Department ``and that he was familiar with 
the judge that was presiding over my case,'' Chung testified. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lawyer gave me an example of someone who did not cooperate  
and how everyone around him was taken care of,'' Chung said. ``He 
said that this client was sentenced to a country club jail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Brockway nor Luu were available for comment, their  
office said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, Chung gave $360,000 in political contributions from 1994  
to 1996 and made more than 50 visits to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung said his donations included $20,000 to Democrats that came  
from an account that had recently been replenished by the $300,000 
from Ji, the head of Chinese military intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung described his first meeting with Ji at a restaurant in  
China in August 1996. Ji used an alias and Chung didn't know his 
real identity until afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	They spoke about Clinton, Chung said, and Ji told him: ``We hope  
to see him re-elected. I will give you 300,000 U.S. dollars. You 
can give it to the president and the Democratic Party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The woman who introduced them, Liu Chao Ying, later told Chung  
Ji's true identity and transferred the $300,000 to his bank 
account, Chung testified. He said he introduced Liu to DNC chairman 
Don Fowler as the daughter of a powerful general. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung also responded to criticism from Democratric Party  
officials, charging they ``should be ashamed of themselves for 
attempting to jump on me and hide from the fact that they 
aggressively solicited me for money.''

<HEADLINE> Jamir Miller Signs With Browns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Jamir Miller's past doesn't concern the  
Cleveland Browns, who are convinced the outside linebacker can be 
part of their future. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, who led the Arizona Cardinals in tackles last season,  
agreed to terms on a one-year contract with Cleveland on Tuesday. 
The 25-year-old Miller will make $1.3 million this season and could 
earn an additional $900,000 with incentives. 
</P>
<P>
	The team finalized the deal on Tuesday with Miller's agent,  
Leigh Steinberg, who reportedly was angry with the Browns for the 
way they treated another of his clients, quarterback Akili Smith, 
leading up to the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
	But Miller also comes to the new Browns with some old baggage --  
a history of off-the-field legal problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller played the last five seasons for Arizona, but turned down  
a two-year deal from the Cardinals in March thinking he could get 
more on the free-agent market. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was little interest, perhaps because the 6-foot-5,  
266-pounder was suspended for four games in 1995 for violating the 
NFL's substance-abuse policy. It was Miller's second strike in the 
league program; a third one would mean a one-year suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller was also accused of pointing a gun at a bouncer in May  
1995, and he was arrested twice while at UCLA -- for possession of 
$13,000 in stolen stereo and computer equipment and unlawful 
possession of a gun. He pleaded no contest to the charges and was 
put on probation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I discussed it with him, and he feels like he's made some  
mistakes in his time,'' Dwight Clark, Cleveland's director of 
football operations told the Akron Beacon Journal. ``He's matured. 
He's got a family now and he thinks he's straightened his life out 
the last four years, and I have no reason to disagree with that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A 1994 first-round pick out of UCLA -- the 10th overall -- Miller  
led the Cardinals in tackles last season with 150 -- including 87 
solos. He also recorded three sacks and started in all 16 games for 
the third straight year in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller should immediately move into the starting outside  
linebacking position for the Browns, who are planning to use a base 
4-3 defense in their first year back in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller will likely start alongside Chris Spielman and John  
Thierry, giving the Browns a solid linebacking corps. Lenoy Jones 
had been penciled in as the Browns' starter on the weak side. 
</P>
<P>
	``The addition of Jamir Miller fills a hole at the outside  
linebacking position,'' Clark said. ``He has an outstanding 
combination of speed and size, and his NFL experience will enable 
him to provide leadership in the locker room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, 25, is the second high-profile player to leave the  
Cardinals for the Browns. Offensive left tackle Lomas Brown joined 
Cleveland earlier this year.

president of a Chinese beer company asked him to deliver ``a 
shopping bag of money and visas'' to Parish. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department is investigating Parish, spokesman Maria  
Rudensky said Tuesday. She declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Parish, a 16-year State Department veteran, handled visa matters  
at the embassy from 1994 to 1996. He retired last year. He could 
not be reached for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats attacked Chung's credibility, accusing him of wrongly  
taking credit for the release of dissident Harry Wu from a Chinese 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Henry Waxman of California, the committee's senior  
Democrat, also scoffed at the notion that the money given to Chung 
was part of a Chinese conspiracy to influence the U.S. election. 
Waxman said it would have been a ``very strange way'' to run a 
conspiracy, since Chung spent most of the funds on personal items. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung became a cooperating witness in the federal investigation  
of campaign fund raising after pleading guilty to making illegal 
contributions to Clinton and other Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of Chung's story had been leaked prior to his testimony  
before the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee. But his 
appearance came at a sensitive time in U.S.-Chinese relations, 
which have been strained by the mistaken bombing of the Chinese 
Embassy in Yugoslavia and allegations that China stole U.S. nuclear 
secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	China denies trying to influence the U.S. elections or spying.  
</P>
<P>
	Chung disclosed Tuesday that after he began cooperating with the  
Justice Department, he was contacted by Robert Luu, a San Gabriel, 
Calif., businessman who claimed to make the approach on behalf of 
one of the Chinese officials whom Chung had previously worked with. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung said Luu first threatened that he should not cooperate  
with the FBI. ``The message was as follows: `If you keep your mouth 
shut, you and your family will be safe,''' he told lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung said Luu then introduced him to an attorney in San  
Gabriel, identified during the hearing as David Brockway, promising 
that the lawyer would take care of his legal problems and that Luu 
would pay his legal bills if he kept quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the conversations with Luu were photographed and  
recorded by FBI agents, who at one point placed Chung and his 
family in protective custody, Chung said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was told the attorney was connected and knew the No. 3  
person'' at the Justice Department ``and that he was familiar with 
the judge that was presiding over my case,'' Chung testified. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lawyer gave me an example of someone who did not cooperate  
and how everyone around him was taken care of,'' Chung said. ``He 
said that this client was sentenced to a country club jail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Brockway nor Luu were available for comment, their  
office said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, Chung gave $360,000 in political contributions from 1994  
to 1996 and made more than 50 visits to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung said his donations included $20,000 to Democrats that came  
from an account that had recently been replenished by the $300,000 
from Ji, the head of Chinese military intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung described his first meeting with Ji at a restaurant in  
China in August 1996. Ji used an alias and Chung didn't know his 
real identity until afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	They spoke about Clinton, Chung said, and Ji told him: ``We hope  
to see him re-elected. I will give you 300,000 U.S. dollars. You 
can give it to the president and the Democratic Party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The woman who introduced them, Liu Chao Ying, later told Chung  
Ji's true identity and transferred the $300,000 to his bank 
account, Chung testified. He said he introduced Liu to DNC chairman 
Don Fowler as the daughter of a powerful general. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung also responded to criticism from Democratric Party  
officials, charging they ``should be ashamed of themselves for 
attempting to jump on me and hide from the fact that they 
aggressively solicited me for money.''

	NATO Airstrikes Continue  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO continued its airstrikes on  
Yugoslavia today, saying it does not believe Serb forces are being 
withdrawn from Kosovo. At least seven people were killed in the 
allied attacks, Serb media said. NATO said there was no evidence 
Yugoslavia had withdrawn any of the estimated 40,000 troops and 
special police from the Serbian province. In Washington, Defense 
Secretary William Cohen said NATO will accept nothing less than a 
total withdrawal of forces from Kosovo as part of its conditions to 
halt the air campaign. 

</P>
<P>
	China, Russia Agree NATO Must Stop  
</P>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- A spokesman for the Chinese government said a  
Russian envoy and senior Chinese leaders agreed today that NATO 
must halt its bombing of Yugoslavia as a precondition for resolving 
the Kosovo crisis. The precondition appeared to go beyond a 
proposed solution to the Kosovo crisis that Russia agreed to last 
week. Meanwhile, protests against NATO's accidental bombing of the 
Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia ebbed today, but the U.S. ambassador 
warned that the return to Beijing of the remains of three Chinese 
killed in the attack could touch off more unrest.

	Ex-Welfare Recipients Studied  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Most Americans who have been swept from  
welfare rolls have jobs and earn more than they got from the 
government -- but not enough to escape poverty. That's the picture 
painted by 21 state studies that, after much speculation, provide 
the first glimpse of what has happened to the millions who have 
left welfare amid tough new rules and unprecedented economic 
growth. While homelessness and other worst-case scenarios are rare, 
a substantial number of these families face hardships, such as 
trouble paying for food and utility bills, an Associated Press 
review of the studies shows.

	Chung Testifies Before House Panel  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Weaving a tale of intrigue, fund-raiser Johnny  
Chung testified today he took $300,000 from a Chinese intelligence 
official who wanted to re-elect President Clinton. He alleged he 
later was offered hush money to discourage his cooperation with the 
FBI. But Chung told lawmakers in his first public testimony that he 
never acted as an agent for the Chinese government. Chung became a 
cooperating witness in the federal investigation of campaign fund 
raising after pleading guilty to making illegal contributions to 
Clinton and other Democrats.

	FDA Issues Warning on 'Party Drugs'  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans should avoid more than a half-dozen  
sleep aids and ``party drugs'' sold in health food stores and on 
the Internet because they can send people into comas or even kill, 
the government warned today. The urgent consumer warning is part of 
repeated Food and Drug Administration efforts to remove from the 
market chemicals related to a party drug called GHB that was banned 
in 1991. The FDA warned about products sold under the names 
Revitalize Plus, Serenity, Enliven, GHRE, SomatoPro, NRG3, Thunder 
Nectar and Weight Belt Cleaner. At least three deaths are linked to 
the products

<HEADLINE> Ex-Speaker Guilty of Tax Evasion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) -- A former House speaker and his wife were  
found guilty Tuesday of failing to report hundreds of thousands of 
dollars in income on their tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
	Bolley ``Bo'' Johnson, 47, was convicted on four of five tax  
evasion counts and his wife, Judi, was convicted on three of four 
counts. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Johnson looked stunned and her husband bit his lip as the  
court clerk read the verdicts. Both were taken into custody by 
marshals. The judge said he would consider written motions for 
their release prior to sentencing July 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson faces a maximum sentence of 12 years in prison. For Mrs.  
Johnson, 48, faces a maximum 9 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, a Democrat, served in the Legislature through November  
1994 when his two-year term as speaker ended. He works in Pensacola 
as a real estate broker. His wife is a former state Department of 
Revenue sales tax analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecution alleged they tried to hide income they received  
for lobbying on behalf of casino gambling, road building, lobbying, 
health care and other businesses. Johnson had strong ties to Gov. 
Lawton Chiles and other powerful officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple received $1.6 million in consulting fees from 1992  
through 1996, failing to report $503,861. Defense lawyers argued 
the omissions were unintentional, and therefore, not a crime.

<HEADLINE> A Down-Home Musical Couple for NYC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- As a music producer and bar owner in New York's  
East Village, Eric ``Roscoe'' Ambel has two reasons for being 
inundated with tapes from struggling musicians looking for a big 
break. 
</P>
<P>
	Most are depressingly bad and wind up being tossed aside. So it  
was with some trepidation that he accepted the tape handed to him 
by Mary Lee Kortes. 
</P>
<P>
	They'd been dating for a few months and it was dawning on Ambel  
that he had fallen in love. This was a real complication. What if 
he listened and heard no discernible talent? What would he say 
then? 
</P>
<P>
	What if it were really bad?  
</P>
<P>
	Fortunately, it wasn't. He heard a lovely voice and a talent for  
pop songwriting, the same thing the public can now hear on an album 
by her band, Mary Lee's Corvette. 
</P>
<P>
	It was safe for Ambel to exhale. Even now, approaching the  
eighth anniversary of their wedding, the alternative is too painful 
to consider. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's one of those things where there's no reason to even  
think about it,'' Ambel said, sipping a soda at his bar, the 
Lakeside Lounge, and glancing at his wife. ``And I'm happy about 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two grew up far from New York -- Kortes in Montana, Ambel in  
Illinois. Now they're the quintessential New York City couple, yet 
lately have built their careers on music not necessarily associated 
with the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Lee's Corvette often sounds like it belongs in a Paris  
cafe. It's pure pop music for adults that's given a melancholy air 
by Joe Chiofalo's accordion, the band's most dominant instrument 
after Kortes' voice. 
</P>
<P>
	Ambel is a prominent producer in the alternative country scene,  
after stints as a guitarist with Joan Jett's Blackhearts and New 
York's tough guy rockers of the 1980s, the Del Lords. Missouri's 
Bottle Rockets and North Carolina's Backsliders are two recent 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
	While a team off-stage, Kortes and Ambel have generally followed  
their own musical paths. They both write songs, but haven't written 
together. When Kortes asked him to play guitar in her band, Ambel 
declined. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're married and I take that commitment very seriously,'' he  
said. ``I've been in a lot of bands in my life, and every band I've 
ever been in broke up. I just said, `I will find you a guitar 
player.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Where she used his expertise was in making her record, ``True  
Lovers of Adventure.'' Neither had ever been satisfied with 
recordings of her music before. They had usually reflected the 
taste of the producer, and Kortes' personality never seemed to come 
through as it did in club shows with just a few players. 
</P>
<P>
	She asked Ambel to produce her record and was pleased with the  
result. Put it this way: They're still married. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the first recorded stuff I had that made people respond  
emotionally,'' she said. ``That was a real godsend. Being in the 
studio with him was wonderful because he just knows when the moment 
is magic. He knows when you got it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ambel -- perhaps with an assist from Ed McMahon -- is responsible  
for the name of Kortes' band. 
</P>
<P>
	Sifting through her mail one day, she came across a sweepstakes  
letter that told her she may have already won $75,000 or a free 
Corvette. The letter had several tiny pictures of a car, and under 
each one it said, ``Mary Lee's Corvette.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Eric saw it and said, `There's your band name.' I still have  
the letter. I didn't send it in,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of Kortes' songs will make you smile: ``The Status With  
Gladys'' is about a woman who tries to hide the fact that she's gay 
from an older sister. Many more will bring a tear, or tug at the 
heart, which is where Chiofalo's accordion comes in handy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sort of intrinsically has that feeling of longing,  
depending on how it's played,'' she said. ``Eric refers to it as 
the red wine style.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe is red wine as opposed to red peppers,'' Ambel continued.  
``I think we've all had enough of the red pepper zydeco playing. I 
have. The red wine accordion is a beautiful thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While threads of Kortes' life run through her songs, she's quick  
to volunteer that there's nothing autobiographical about ``Why 
Don't You Leave Him,'' a chilling composition about a woman who 
won't leave an abusive man. ``He says he'll kill me,'' the narrator 
sings, ``and I believe him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Lee's Corvette performed the song this spring at a meeting  
of the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence. The song 
is being used by the Nicole Brown Charitable Foundation to raise 
awareness about domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Ambel has put out a couple of albums with his loosely defined  
band, Roscoe's Gang, but for the past couple of years, he has 
concentrated on producing. Now he's ready to devote his summer to 
writing songs. A CD compilation of the criminally overlooked Del 
Lords is also due soon. 
</P>
<P>
	He is also opening another Lakeside Lounge in Raleigh, N.C. The  
Manhattan bar, named after his parents' summer home in the Midwest, 
is both a comfortable neighborhood hangout and an intimate showcase 
for musicians. The well-stocked jukebox is the star of the place. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes a friend at a record company will ask Ambel to set up  
a show for an artist the label is thinking of signing. 
</P>
<P>
	But for all the record companies based in New York, and all of  
the musicians who come to the city seeking fame and fortune, it's 
not always the best place for them to be. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you think about it, there are not that many bands from  
New York,'' he said. ``It's a hard place to break out of. It's 
easier to get an A&AMP;R guy to go to Tucson to see a band, where he 
can go there for three days and play golf, than to get the guy to 
come down to Avenue B.''

<HEADLINE> Veto Threatened on Kosovo Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House-Senate negotiators hoping to ship  
President Clinton legislation this week paying for the fight with 
Yugoslavia, aid to Central America and other items are facing a new 
veto threat from the White House. But it seems likely that such a 
confrontation will be avoided. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers from the two chambers planned to meet this afternoon  
to begin crafting a compromise, multibillion-dollar package. But 
Monday evening, White House officials threatened for the first time 
to veto it, citing a host of objections. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, the administration had threatened to veto a  
stand-alone aid measure for Central America and U.S. farmers 
because it would cut domestic programs and add environmental and 
other items the White House opposes. They had also complained about 
-- but not threatened to veto -- a separate bill in which the House 
more than doubled Clinton's $6 billion request for the fight over 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, however, White House officials warned that the new,  
blended legislation was in danger of being rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a number of very troubling issues ... and the  
president's senior advisors would continue to recommend that he 
veto this legislation unless the objectionable provisions are 
resolved in a satisfactory manner,'' said a letter to House leaders 
from White House budget chief Jacob Lew. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked specifically about the extra House-approved defense funds,  
Lew said in an interview, ``It's important to scale it back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Members of both parties have said privately that they don't  
think Clinton would veto the Kosovo package as long as it is kept 
at roughly the $13 billion range the House approved last week. 
Congressional bargainers seem likely to pare it back even further, 
perhaps to about $10 billion, said participants who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	These officials say that with American troops in the field and  
with Clinton himself saying the Pentagon needs more money, he would 
be hard-pressed to reject such a measure. 
</P>
<P>
	The extra money the House added was for U.S. military operations  
and installations around the world, and a pay raise for the troops. 
The most likely item to be dropped is $1 billion the House added to 
modernize U.S. bases overseas, aides say. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really haven't settled anything yet,'' House Appropriations  
Committee Chairman Bill Young, R-Fla., said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	On Feb. 16, Clinton requested nearly $1 billion to help Honduras  
and other Central American nations devastated by last autumn's 
deadly Hurricane Mitch. He later asked for $152 million to help 
U.S. farmers hurt by record-low prices for wheat, corn and other 
farm products. 
</P>
<P>
	On March 23, the Senate approved a $2.5 billion bill for Central  
America and farmers, which included aid they had added for the U.S. 
steel, oil, gas and mining industries. The next day, the House 
approved a $1.3 billion version without the Senate add-ons. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration objections include Senate language that would bar  
the federal government from sharing in the $246 billion settlement 
states have won from the tobacco industry, delay increases in 
royalties oil companies pay for using federal lands and postpone 
stricter requirements for hardrock mining on government property. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House also opposes GOP plans to pay for the Central  
America aid with cuts in food stamps, along with money the United 
States uses to back loans by international lending agencies and 
other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration prefers using this year's expected federal  
surplus. Many aides from both parties, however, believe a 
compromise will be reached on spending reductions.

<HEADLINE> New Offer Made for Penguins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- An unidentified buyer has come forward with an  
offer of $85 million to buy and move the financially troubled 
Pittsburgh Penguins, an NHL lawyer said today. 
</P>
<P>
	William Daly, the league's vice president for legal affairs,  
would not identify the buyer who emerged during the last two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The offer was revealed as a judge in U.S. Bankruptcy Court heard  
the league's request to move up a review of the league's plan to 
break the team up. 
</P>
<P>
	Bankruptcy Judge Bernard Markovitz approved the request and  
scheduled the hearing for May 19, 12 days ahead of the NHL's 
deadline for resolving the Penguins' ownership. 
</P>
<P>
	That is also the day of Game 6 of the Penguins' playoff series  
with Toronto, if it is necessary. The series is tied 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
	The league is using the prospect of losing the team as leverage  
to direct the Penguins toward its preferred buyer, Mario Lemieux, 
whose investment group is offering $50 million in cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffrey Levitan, another NHL lawyer, also said the team could be  
broken up. Levitan said assets including players would be sold 
piecemeal, although that would fetch much less than $85 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The team's largest creditors, banks and insurers, favor a vote  
on the NHL's plan at the same time Lemieux's plan is considered. 
Other creditors oppose that, saying it could be confusing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins find themselves entangled in a scenario previously  
unseen in major U.S. pro sports, with the franchise's fate being 
played out in bankruptcy court at the same time the team is in the 
NHL playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Hockey players are accustomed to regularly changing uniforms,  
cities and addresses, so the possibility they might leave 
Pittsburgh probably is more unnerving to their fans than it is to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps that is why coach Kevin Constantine got testy Monday  
when a TV station producer asked him yet again about the 
difficulties of leading a team that may be out of money before it 
runs out of games to play. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins play Game 3 of their conference semifinal series  
against the Toronto Maple Leafs tonight at the Civic Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not to be rude, but I'll say it for the 1,000th time,  
bankruptcy is not an issue,'' Constantine said. ``It shouldn't be, 
it can't be and it isn't. ... It doesn't affect the coaches or 
players. The playoffs are the only thing we're focused on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That can't be said for all of the Penguins' nervous employees.  
</P>
<P>
	The NHL strongly supports Lemieux's bid, but wants the Penguins'  
situation to be sorted out by June 1, or the franchise likely will 
be disbanded or sold elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux's bid is expected to get a financial boost when his  
group finalizes an agreement with Internet millionaire Mark Cuban 
to join him. Cuban, who founded the Broadcast.com web site that 
carries pro and college sports, concerts and radio stations on the 
Internet, is a Mount Lebanon, Pa., native who wants to keep the 
Penguins in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban and his partners recently sold Broadcast.com to Yahoo! for  
$6.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Penguins star Jaromir Jagr can't think of a better scenario: a  
well-funded ownership group led by Lemieux, the team's former star. 
</P>
<P>
	``He loves offense. He loves to have a winning team. He would do  
anything to win a Stanley Cup,'' Jagr said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Jagr said he hasn't closely followed the case, and he  
learned the details only upon visiting briefly with Lemieux. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't worry about that stuff ... it's all about the lawyers  
and I don't understand that stuff,'' Jagr said. ``Mario explained a 
little bit about it, but I have no clue what is going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Jagr joked that if Lemieux became his boss, he would  
not renegotiate his $48 million contract. Part of the Penguins' 
current financial problems stem from the estimated $26 million in 
deferred salary owed Lemieux.

	``There are two different kinds of owners: owners who are  
businessmen and owners who love the game, and I'd put Mario in that 
second category,'' Jagr said. ``Some of the owners, it's a game, 
but they just don't understand it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be a lot better for everybody (if Mario got the  
team),'' he said. ``The fans would start coming more. They don't 
know if the Pens are going to be here or not. Mario Lemieux could 
put the team in the right direction and turn the franchise 
around.''

<HEADLINE> Garciaparra Speechless After 2 Slams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- By the time he crossed the plate after his third  
home run of the night -- his second grand slam -- Nomar Garciaparra 
was speechless. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was amazing,'' Garciaparra said. ``I've never hit three  
home runs in a game before -- not in Little League, college, 
nowhere. I'm glad I waited until the big leagues to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra became the first American Leaguer in 24 years with  
10 RBIs in one game, and became just the 11th player in major 
league history to hit a pair of grand slams in a game. 
</P>
<P>
	Ted Williams never did it. Neither did Jim Rice nor Mo Vaughn.  
</P>
<P>
	``You just shake your head and tip your cap at what happened,''  
Ken Griffey Jr. said after Garciaparra led the Boston Red Sox over 
the Seattle Mariners 12-4 Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Boston center fielder Fred Lynn had been the last AL  
player with 10 RBIs, accomplishing the feat at Tiger Stadium on 
June 18, 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra, 25, had some pretty impressive accomplishments even  
before Monday night. He was the Red Sox's first pick in the 1994 
amateur draft, he won the 1997 AL Rookie of the Year award after 
leading the league with 209 hits. He put together a rookie record 
30-game hitting streak, and set the major league record for RBIs by 
a leadoff hitter with 85. 
</P>
<P>
	In his second season, the All-Star shortstop became just the  
fifth major leaguer with 30 or more homers in each of his first two 
seasons, following his rookie year total of 30 with 35. Rudy York 
(1936-37), Ron Kittle (1983-84), Jose Canseco (1986-88) and Mark 
McGwire (1987-90) were the others. 
</P>
<P>
	Midway through 1998, the Red Sox inserted Garciaparra into the  
cleanup spot, where he has remained. 
</P>
<P>
	His power was not evident the first month of this season. The  
club lost Vaughn, who batted ahead of him, to Anaheim. Many 
predicted Garciaparra's pitch selection and his power numbers would 
be reduced. 
</P>
<P>
	After missing six games early in the year with a bad hamstring,  
his power game got off to a slow start. He didn't hit his first 
homer until last Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never got down,'' he said. ``I remained positive. I was  
swinging the bat well. It was bad luck here or there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then he beat up a Mariners' staff that began Tuesday with the  
highest ERA in the major leagues (6.54). Seattle has allowed 50 
homers, the most in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra's first grand slam came before rookie Brett  
Hinchliffe (0-2) retired a batter. Garciaparra then sliced a 
two-run shot around the right-field foul pole off Hinchliffe in the 
third for a 6-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	After fouling out in the fourth and walking in the sixth,  
Garciaparra hit his second slam off Eric Weaver in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was seeing the ball well and I threw one right down the  
middle,'' Weaver said. ``You can't do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All five of Garciaparra's homers this season have come in the  
last six games. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're swinging the bat well good things happen,'' he  
said ``It's nice to have a night like this. They don't happen very 
often. I'm just going to enjoy it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 10 RBIs tied the Boston record that Lynn shared with Norm  
Zauchin (May 27, 1955) and York (July 27, 1946). 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, he became the first major leaguer to drive in 10  
runs since Mark Whiten had 12 RBIs and four homers for St. Louis on 
Sept. 7, 1993, at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra became the second player this year to hit two grand  
slams in a game -- the Cardinals' Fernando Tatis hit two in one 
inning on April 23. Never before had two players accomplished the 
feat in the same season. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other Red Sox players had two in a game -- York in that 1946  
game and Jim Tabor on July 4, 1939. Garciaparra became the first 
player ever to do it in Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty amazing,'' winner John Wasdin (1-0) said. ``That's  
the great thing about baseball. Another history-making night in 
Fenway Park. What better place to do it?''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Welfare Recipients' Work Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	In the last few years, nearly two dozen states have released  
studies tracking people who have left welfare. Some examine state 
wage reports -- filed by employers for all workers -- to see if 
former recipients are working. Others interview a sample of people 
who have left the rolls. 
</P>
<P>
	It is difficult to compare one state to another because of  
differences in methodology and timing. 
</P>
<P>
	This list shows the states that have released studies, followed  
by the month of release in parentheses and data on how many people 
are working. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless otherwise noted, the percentage given represents those  
working at the time of the survey, as a portion of all people 
surveyed. Four states -- Arkansas, Georgia, Maryland and New York -- 
defined ``working'' as earning at least $100 during a three-month 
period. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Edwin L. Dale Jr., a former New York Times  
reporter and spokesman for the White House Office of Management and 
Budget, died Monday of cancer. He was 75. 
</P>
<P>
	Dale served as assistant director of public affairs at OMB  
between 1981 and 1987 during the Reagan administration. 
</P>
<P>
	He then spent two years as a counselor to Commerce Secretary C.  
William Verity before returning to the budget office as a director 
of external affairs. He worked in the area of policy studies before 
retiring in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Known for his mastery of the federal budget, Dale took as many  
as 110 calls in a day during the height of budget season. 
</P>
<P>
	Dale came to Washington in 1951 as a reporter for the New York  
Herald Tribune. Four years later, he began covering economics for 
the Times. He spent several years in Paris, and later returned to 
Washington with assignments at the White House and the State 
Department. In 1977, Dale went to work on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the author of ``Conservatives in Power'' in 1960 and was  
the primary author of ``The People's Budget,'' published in 1995.

<P>
	PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) -- Joe Flowers, a former Escambia County  
comptroller who lost millions of taxpayer dollars by investing in 
risky securities, died Monday at age 79. 
</P>
<P>
	He had a reputation as the watchdog of public finances for  
almost 40 years, but it was shattered in 1994 when Escambia County 
lost nearly $15 million as the value of its investments in 
derivatives dropped dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
	Four Texas securities brokers subsequently were convicted of  
conspiracy, racketeering and fraud for duping Flowers into 
purchasing the securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Many other public and private investors also lost millions on  
derivatives, whose value is based on -- or derived from -- an 
underlying asset such as a commodity or swings in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history, the December  
1994 collapse of Orange County, Calif.'s investments, also was tied 
to bad bets on derivatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Flowers resigned in 1995 and the Legislature abolished his  
position, which had been made an elected one in 1972. He also was 
indicted on lesser charges of mishandling public money and pleaded 
no contest. He was ordered to pay $1,600 in court costs.

President Richard M. Nixon and remained active in Republican 
politics throughout his life, died Monday from injuries sustained

<P>
	After working for Nixon's legislative assistant from 1957 to  
1961, McWhorter served as an attorney for AT&AMP;T until his retirement

<HEADLINE> EU Energy Unions Expect Job Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Labor unions representing energy  
industry workers in the European Union said Tuesday that 25 percent 
of jobs in the EU electricity and gas sector could be lost in the 
next four years as plans to break up state monopolies are 
implemented. 
</P>
<P>
	``Already 250,000 jobs have been lost due to restructuring,''  
said Carola Fischbach-Pyttel, General Secretary of the European 
Federation of Public Service Unions, or EPSU. 
</P>
<P>
	Fischbach-Pyttel made these comments in a statement released  
ahead of a demonstration of energy workers outside a meeting of 
energy ministers from the 15 EU nations. Hundreds of protesters 
demanded measures to compensate workers who lose out because of the 
break up of national gas and electricity monopolies. 
</P>
<P>
	EU rules call for the gradual opening of the electricity and gas  
markets to private competition. 
</P>
<P>
	EU energy spokesman Costas Verros said that the European  
Commission will present a general study on the job losses in the 
energy and gas sector in the next six months. 
</P>

	EPSU Unions represents 10 million workers providing services to  
local, regional and central governments and utilities in energy, 
water and waste.

<HEADLINE>  Mourning Gets Help Against Knicks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Alonzo Mourning turned in another strong  
performance against the New York Knicks, and this time he had some 
help. 
</P>
<P>
	Mourning scored 26 points Monday night and anchored the Miami  
Heat's defense, as usual, leading them past the New York Knicks 
83-73 in Game 2 of the best-of-5 series. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the MVP of the league,'' Knicks counterpart Patrick Ewing  
said. ``If he doesn't get it, there's something wrong with you all 
who vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Game 1, a 20-point Heat loss, Mourning was a one-man show.  
But in Game 2, he enjoyed plenty of support from guards Tim 
Hardaway, Dan Majerle and Terry Porter. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway had another poor shooting game, going just 1-for-5 and  
scoring 11 points, but he dished out 11 assists. Majerle made two 
3-pointers, his first baskets of the series, to hold New York at 
bay in the final quarter. And Porter had 11 points and six rebounds 
off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those guys stepped up and made a difference in the game,''  
Mourning said. ``They made plays for everybody. It's about 
penetrating and knocking shots down, and those three are the 
MVPs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, when Mourning had 27 points, the rest of the Heat's  
starting lineup shot 24 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The other night, there was only one guy that showed up for  
us,'' forward P.J. Brown said. ``That was Zo, and everybody knows 
it. There was no way we could win this playoff series if only one 
guy is showing up to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the Heat also know they need Mourning to lead the way, which  
he did Monday by making 10 of 16 shots, grabbing eight rebounds and 
blocking four shots in 46 minutes.

<HEADLINE>  Mourning Gets Help Against Knicks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Alonzo Mourning turned in another strong  
performance against the New York Knicks, and this time he had some 
help. 
</P>
<P>
	Mourning scored 26 points Monday night and anchored the Miami  
Heat's defense, as usual, leading them past the New York Knicks 
83-73 in Game 2 of the best-of-5 series. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the MVP of the league,'' Knicks counterpart Patrick Ewing  
said. ``If he doesn't get it, there's something wrong with you all 
who vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Game 1, a 20-point Heat loss, Mourning was a one-man show.  
But in Game 2, he enjoyed plenty of support from guards Tim 
Hardaway, Dan Majerle and Terry Porter. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway had another poor shooting game, going just 1-for-5 and  
scoring 11 points, but he dished out 11 assists. Majerle made two 
3-pointers, his first baskets of the series, to hold New York at 
bay in the final quarter. And Porter had 11 points and six rebounds 
off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those guys stepped up and made a difference in the game,''  
Mourning said. ``They made plays for everybody. It's about 
penetrating and knocking shots down, and those three are the 
MVPs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, when Mourning had 27 points, the rest of the Heat's  
starting lineup shot 24 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The other night, there was only one guy that showed up for  
us,'' forward P.J. Brown said. ``That was Zo, and everybody knows 
it. There was no way we could win this playoff series if only one 
guy is showing up to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the Heat also know they need Mourning to lead the way, which  
he did Monday by making 10 of 16 shots, grabbing eight rebounds and 
blocking four shots in 46 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was very active,'' Heat coach Pat Riley said. ``He played  
great the other night, and he played great tonight. He's so 
physical, and he's so needed by us out there. 
</P>
<P>
	``His presence in the middle can change a lot of things.  
Anything that was coming to the basket, he was changing. He 
definitely gave us the game we needed to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing had 16 points and 15 rebounds but struggled to stop  
Mourning. The former Georgetown alums were matched up more 
frequently than in Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``Patrick and I have had some battles,'' Mourning said. ``But

<HEADLINE>  NHL Playoffs Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Once Pavol Demitra became accustomed to the  
playoff grind, his game took off again. 
</P>
<P>
	Demitra, the St. Louis Blues' leading scorer in the regular  
season, continued a postseason surge when he beat Ed Belfour in 
overtime for a 3-2 victory over the Dallas Stars on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I scored almost 90 points and all of a sudden, I'm  
struggling,'' Demitra said. ``But I'm back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So are the Blues, who cut their series deficit against the NHL  
regular-season champions to 2-1 heading into Game 4 Wednesday night 
in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't wait,'' Demitra said. ``I'm so excited, I wish we can  
play right away. I'm just so pumped up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other Western Conference series continues tonight with  
Detroit playing host Colorado and holding a 2-0 lead. In the East, 
Toronto visits Pittsburgh tonight, and Boston is at Buffalo on 
Wednesday night. Both of those series are tied 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Demitra, who was 10th in the NHL with 89 points, has three goals  
and an assist in the last two games since making the adjustment to 
the tighter checking and close quarters of playoff competition. 
That represents half of his postseason output; before Monday, he 
was a team-worst minus-4. 
</P>
<P>
	In Game 3, he was plus-2 and also scored his first points in a  
Blues' playoff victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's worked harder in determination to come up with loose  
pucks and taking it to the net more,'' coach Joel Quenneville said. 
``And he's getting in place in the high-traffic areas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Demitra got to just such an area, outside the crease at the  
right side of the net, when he scored the winner at 2:43 of 
overtime off a feed from Geoff Courtnall. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time I'm on the ice with him, I feel I can score,''  
Demitra said. ``He fed me last year all the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues' third goal also was a Demitra production. After  
avoiding a check from Richard Matvichuk, Demitra slipped the puck 
to rookie Jochen Hecht, who slid in a backhander for a 2-1 lead at 
4:52 of the third. 
</P>
<P>
	Hecht and Mike Eastwood, who also scored for the Blues, were  
unlikely offensive sources. Hecht had a team-leading 56 points with 
the Worcester Icecats of the AHL, but wasn't summoned until 
Saturday after they were eliminated from the playoffs. Eastwood, a 
faceoff specialist, has seven goals in 62 career playoff games and 
two points in 10 playoff games this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of unsung heroes in the playoffs and we're  
getting that right now,'' Blues right wing Scott Young said. 
``That's why we've been successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars, the NHL regular-season champions with a  
franchise-record 114 points, missed a chance to put the Blues in a 
huge hole. Only two teams have recovered from a 3-0 series deficit, 
the last the New York Islanders in 1975 against Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas' team-record six-game playoff winning streak also came to  
an end. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to go 16-0,'' defenseman Derian Hatcher said.  
``You expect to lose a game here or there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brett Hull scored in his first postseason game in St. Louis  
since leaving the Blues after a decade of stardom last summer, and 
Darryl Sydor added his first of the playoffs for Dallas. A crowd of 
19,268, the Blues' first sellout of the playoffs, booed when Hull's 
name was announced. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues largely silenced Joe Nieuwendyk, who had an assist and  
only one shot. Nieuwendyk had two goals and an assist, including 
the game-winner in overtime, in Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars may be without center Jere Lehtinen in Game 4.  
Lehtinen injured his right knee in the second period and is listed 
as day-to-day. 
</P>
<P>
	Sydor forced the overtime with his first goal of the playoffs at  
9:08 of the third. Grant Fuhr got a glove on Pat Verbeek's drive 
from the slot, and Grant Marshall got his stick on the rebound 
before Sydor tapped it in. 
</P>
<P>
	A four-minute high-sticking penalty on Blues captain Chris  
Pronger, who caught Hatcher in the face, helped the Stars get off 
to a fast start. Hull scored his second goal of the playoffs, and 
only Dallas' third in 33 power-play opportunities, with a shot from 
the left circle at 3:07. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues got off only three shots in the first period, but tied  
it on a fluky goal at 2:58 of the second. Ricard Persson flipped 
the puck end-over-end toward the net and it deflected off 
Eastwood's glove and Sergei Zubov's stick before eluding Belfour. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues outshot the Stars 24-18 in regulation and took the  
only four shots in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't shoot enough,'' Stars forward Jamie Langenbrunner  
said. ``Instead of putting it on net, we passed.''

<HEADLINE> Blues Getting Used To Overtime Duty / Hockey Game Story  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The St. Louis Blues know all about extra effort  
in the playoffs, considering half of their games have gone into 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	After cutting the Dallas Stars' second-round series lead to 2-1  
on Pavol Demitra's goal at 2:43 of the extra period in Game 3 
Monday night, the Blues are getting used to life on the high wire. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're on pins and needles the whole time you're out there,''  
said center Craig Conroy, whose team will try to even the series 
Wednesday night. ``Emotionally, it's a big swing. You go from the 
other night in Dallas where your heart just feels like it drops, 
and then last night there's the joy of winning. 
</P>
<P>
	Demitra's game-winner handed the Stars their first loss in seven  
playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
	But it hasn't all been roses for the Blues in OT. Shane Doan  
gave the Phoenix Coyotes the victory in Game 2 of the first round 
and Dallas' Joe Nieuwendyk ended Game 2 of this series. 
</P>
<P>
	After Nieuwendyk's second overtime goal of the playoffs, the  
Stars appeared unbeatable. The regular-season champions, who had 27 
more points than the Blues in the regular season, entered Game 3 
with a six-game playoff winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
	A victory would have given Dallas a virtually insurmountable  
lead. Only two teams have rallied from a 3-0 series deficit in NHL 
history, with the 1975 New York Islanders the last to do it. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a pivotal game,'' Stars center Mike Modano said. ``We  
could have taken a stranglehold on the series, but we let them get 
right back in it. It's a disappointing game for a lot of guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not that they're overly discouraged heading into Game 4.  
</P>
<P>
	``You never expect to sweep a team,'' goalie Ed Belfour said.  
``The key will be how we bounce back the next game. We expect them 
to come out strong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Ken Hitchcock said the major difference in the 114-point  
Stars and 87-point Blues is St. Louis had to use five goaltenders 
due to injuries and Dallas went wire to wire with Belfour. Both 
teams play a defensive, territorial game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We anticipate there's going to be more overtime games,''  
Hitchcock said. ``It's going to get closer, not further away. If it 
goes seven, as long as we win, I don't care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The overtimes haven't seemed to make a cumulative effect on the  
Blues. The only concessions the team made Tuesday was giving 
36-year-old goalie Grant Fuhr and iron man defenders Chris Pronger 
and Al MacInnis a day off. 
</P>
<P>
	Pronger and MacInnis rank first and second in playoff minutes,  
each at about 36 minutes per game. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a forward, you play 15 or 20 minutes, so it hasn't been too  
bad yet,'' Conroy said. ``I don't know about Pronger and Al, 
though. They might be a little more tired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The excitement of the playoffs, no doubt, is enough to wash away  
the fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm exhausted right now,'' Blues wing Scott Young said after a  
half-hour skate Tuesday, ``but tomorrow I'll be fine. Overtimes are 
fun. They're so exciting to play, and as you play more and more of 
them you're not as nervous going into them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hitchcock expects Jere Lehtinen, the Selke Trophy winner last  
season as the NHL's top defensive forward, to return from an 
injured right knee in Game 4. Lehtinen left in the second period of 
Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Defenseman Shawn Chambers and center Guy Carbonneau also might  
return to the lineup from knee injuries.

<HEADLINE> Wal-Mart Earnings Jump 39 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BENTONVILLE, Ark. (AP) -- Wal-Mart Stores. Inc.'s first-quarter  
earnings rose by 39 percent from a year ago, boosted by strong 
sales at its discount stores and warehouse clubs. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's largest retailer reported Tuesday that it earned  
$1.11 billion, or 25 cents a share, in the quarter ended April 30, 
compared with $828 million, or 18 cents a share, a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales were $34.7 billion, a 16 percent gain over the same period  
last year. Sales at Wal-Mart's U.S. discount stores and 
supercenters rose 15 percent in the quarter, while sales climbed 26 
percent in its international division. Its Sam's Clubs warehouse 
stores saw a 11 percent gain in revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales at stores open more than a year, an industry gauge of  
performance, rose 9.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart's results topped Wall Street analysts' expectations.  
Its stock closed up $2.12 1/2 at $47.31 1/4 in trading on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart continues to dominate the retailing industry,  
attracting shoppers with its affordable prices and wide selection. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Wal-Mart's fourth consecutive quarter of earnings in  
excess of $1 billion and the highest net income ever reported by 
the company in a non-Christmas quarter, said president and CEO 
David Glass. 
</P>
<P>
	During the quarter, Wal-Mart opened nine discount stores and 27  
Supercenters, which includes 21 expanded or relocated discount 
stores. Two new Sam's Club stores and nine international units -- 
one in Canada, one in China and seven in Mexico -- were also opened. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of the quarter, the company operated 1,857 Wal-Mart  
stores, 591 Supercenters, 453 Sam's Clubs in the United States. 
Internationally, Wal-Mart operated 13 stores in Argentina, 14 in 
Brazil, 154 in Canada, 95 in Germany, 423 in Mexico, and 15 in 
Puerto Rico, and under joint venture agreements in six stores in 
China and four in Korea.

<HEADLINE> Bonilla Put on 15-Day Disabled List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- An errant pitch by Colorado's Pedro Astacio has  
sent New York Mets outfielder Bobby Bonilla to the 15-day disabled 
list. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonilla was placed on the DL Tuesday with a bruised left knee.  
Astacio hit him in the knee in the second inning of Colorado's 10-3 
win Monday night, prompting Bonilla to take a step toward the 
mound. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonilla, 36, left the game after flying out in the fourth  
inning. He was already playing with a partially torn ligament in 
his right knee. Bonilla is hitting just .157 (11-for-70) with two 
homers and 11 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	To take Bonilla's place on the roster, the Mets purchased the  
contract of outfielder Benny Agbayani from Triple-A Norfolk. 
</P>
<P>
	Agbayani, 27, was in Denver for Tuesday night's game against the  
Rockies. He hit .356 with eight homers and 32 RBIs in 28 games with 
Norfolk. 
</P>
<P>
	Agbayani played in 11 games with the Mets last season, going  
2-for-15 with one run scored.

<HEADLINE> Records Vital for Disaster Tax Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- People who suffer losses in natural disasters  
such as the Midwestern tornadoes can get federal tax relief, and 
it's much easier if adequate records are available -- and stored in 
a safe place. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internal Revenue Service allows federal income tax  
deductions for people whose homes and businesses are damaged or 
destroyed by tornado, hurricane, earthquake or certain floods. 
</P>
<P>
	Insured damage estimates from last week's tornadoes in Oklahoma  
alone have reached $1 billion, but insurance won't cover every 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
	For tax relief in such cases, proof is essential, and it's smart  
to plan ahead. For instance, the IRS could ask to see records such 
as receipts or canceled checks for household goods such as 
appliances, furniture and art. Even a videotape of a building's 
interior and contents can serve as evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most people are not going to go through every room and  
inventory everything in the house,'' IRS spokesman Don Roberts said 
Monday. ``If you have the videotape, you have that as a reminder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, it doesn't do any good to keep these records if the  
home or business they're in is destroyed. One alternative is to 
store them in a safety deposit box or with a friend or relative 
someplace else. 
</P>
<P>
	The law permits tax deductions only for the ``fair market  
value'' of an item, not the full replacement cost or its 
sentimental value. This lands taxpayers without records in a murky 
area of estimating the worth of such things as used furniture or 
old wedding china. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to depend on the facts and circumstances a taxpayer  
presents and how well-documented the loss is,'' Roberts said of the 
IRS position in such cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Three other cautions: Deductions are permitted only when each  
separate loss is above $100, when the total combined loss for a 
single year exceeds 10 percent of a taxpayer's adjusted gross 
income and when any insurance claims were filed in a timely manner. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Luscombe, tax analyst at CCH Inc. of near Deerfield, Ill.,  
said people who meet those thresholds should remember that 
deductions can be taken for property repairs as well as such items 
as destroyed trees and shrubs. 
</P>
<P>
	Examples of costs that aren't deductible are rental cars,  
temporary housing, cleanup costs or personal injuries, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	If the loss happened in a federal disaster area declared by the  
president, the rules are somewhat different. The loss can be 
deducted in the most recent tax year -- even if April 15 has passed 
-- by filing an amended 1040 return, as long as deductions are 
itemized. 
</P>
<P>
	There also are special rules for small businesses in disaster  
areas that allow deferral of a gain on the purchase of replacement 
equipment, which lowers the income tax bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``This provides relief for businesses that are forced to suspend  
operations for a substantial time due to property damage,'' 
Luscombe said. 
</P>
<P>
	IRS Publications 547 and 584 provide more information on  
disasters and taxes.

<HEADLINE> INS Reassessing Detention Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service  
is taking another look at a plan to relocate detainees on the basis 
of nationality. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``hubbing'' proposal will not be put into effect for illegal  
immigrants awaiting deportation hearings without input from 
advocacy groups, said Brian Perryman, the INS district director in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Perryman met Monday with officials from the Illinois Coalition  
for Immigrants and Refugee Rights, the Midwest Immigrants Rights 
Center and several other groups. 
</P>
<P>
	INS officials had said the plan was open to revision, but  
officials wanted to begin implementation by early summer. They said 
Monday there was no timetable. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the INS realized that they came up with a plan and  
then went to the community. Maybe it should have been the other way 
around,'' said INS spokeswoman Gail Montenegro. 
</P>
<P>
	``In doing that we made a mistake,'' Perryman added.  
</P>
<P>
	The INS has already erased the term ``hubbing,'' a reference to  
the grouping of immigrants by nationality at detention hubs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really doesn't matter what words we use, but what plan we  
use. And Mr. Perryman agreed with that,'' said Rep. Luis Gutierrez, 
D-Ill., who was at Monday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important words are, we're back to square one. We're  
going to get community input on a plan, and the community input 
should help us reach our goals,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan would encompass 18 states in the agency's central  
region. Detained illegal Mexican, Central American and Caribbean 
immigrants would be moved to separate facilities in Texas. All 
other immigrants in question -- those from Europe, Asia and Africa -- 
would be shipped to Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, illegal immigrants are processed at the nearest INS  
facility. The INS says it is under pressure to quickly move 
immigrants out of detention and slash its backlog of cases and 
notes that many detainees are convicted criminals who already have 
their deportation orders. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides agree on the main goals of any proposal: better  
access to legal representation, consular officials, family members 
and other support services; reduced time of detention; and the 
expedited deportation of criminal aliens.

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Elizabeth Taylor is planning a comeback.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm feeling better today than I have for years. Charity work  
and creating perfumes have been keeping me busy, but the positive 
reactions I've received from my recent public activities make me 
want to get back to work,'' the actress said in a statement Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 67-year-old Oscar winner (``Butterfield 8'' in 1960 and  
``Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' in 1966) has been beset with 
health problems, including a broken back last year and lengthy 
recuperation from hip surgeries. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Taylor has appeared in a few projects in recent years but  
has spent much time raising money and awareness for AIDS causes and 
launching the fragrances White Diamonds and Passion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We met with her recently, and she said that she wants to work,  
is very prepared and happy to do character work because after all, 
`Virginia Woolf' was a character role,'' said Marion Rosenberg, who 
is co-managing Miss Taylor's resurgence.

<HEADLINE> Gas Additive May Not Ease Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Oxygen additives in gasoline, touted since  
1993 as one of the most effective ways to cut air pollution, may in 
fact do little to reduce a major ingredient of urban smog, a panel 
of experts said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The study by the National Academy of Sciences panel said the  
additive, being used in about a third of the gasoline sold in the 
United States, is believed to reduce overall peak ozone levels ``by 
only a few percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study said, however, the so-called reformulated gasoline  
with the additive has characteristics other than higher oxygen 
levels that lower pollution from automobiles and light trucks. The 
group made no recommendation whether the program should be 
continued. 
</P>
<P>
	Reformulated gasoline has been required by the EPA since 1995 in  
areas with severe smog. All or parts of 17 states require the fuel, 
including most of the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
	The most widely used oxygenate, MTBE, has been a focus of  
controversy as critics argued that it presents its own 
environmental and health risks. Recently, California reversed 
course and said it would ban the additive beginning in 2002 because 
MTBE has been found in lakes and streams. Officials in Maine 
stopped requiring the additive this month and have asked to be 
taken out of the federal program. 
</P>
<P>
	Peak ozone levels in urban areas have decreased more than 10  
percent since 1986 and continue to decline. But the 11-member panel 
of scientists said ``it is not certain that any part of these 
trends can be significantly attributed to the use of reformulated 
gasoline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ozone results from sunlight's interaction with pollutants  
including hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides, which forms what's 
commonly known as smog. At high levels, especially in summer, it is 
a severe irritant that can damage lung tissue and aggravate 
respiratory problems. About one-fourth of all ozone is attributed 
to automobiles and trucks, almost half to all forms of 
transportation. 
</P>
<P>
	The addition of MTBE or ethanol to gasoline, in itself, ``is  
likely to have little air-quality impact in terms of ozone 
reduction,'' the study by the academy's National Research Council 
said. It said reductions in volatile organic compounds and carbon 
monoxide from cars appear to be quite small, and the additive may 
lead to more nitrogen oxide being released. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was requested by the EPA, which had asked scientists  
to evaluate the comparative benefits of the two oxygen additives -- 
MTBE, which is derived from methanol, and ethanol, which comes from 
corn. The study said ethanol is less effective, but the overall 
impact of MTBE in curbing ozone is not much better. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA said in a statement the agency ``supports the technical  
findings'' of the report, but the findings should not dissuade the 
continued use of reformulated gasoline blends. The agency said the 
report confirms that the gasoline additive reduces toxic emissions 
and has the potential of cutting smog-causing chemicals from cars 
as much as 20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cleaner gasoline is an important tool for achieving cleaner  
air and protecting public health, and we expect that some form of 
cleaner gasoline will always be in demand,'' said EPA spokesman 
David Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
	William Chameides, the science panel's chairman and a professor  
at the Georgia Institute of Technology, said the report should not 
be interpreted to suggest abandonment of reformulated gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not at all,'' Chameides said in a telephone interview. ``We're  
simply looking at the impact.'' He said reformulated gasoline may 
be environmentally beneficial overall, but ``it is not possible to 
attribute a significant portion of past reductions in smog to the 
use of these gasoline additives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA directed in 1993 that reformulated gasoline, containing  
an oxygen additive, be used in nine urban areas with the most 
severe smog problems. Other states were allowed to begin requiring 
the fuel in some counties if they wanted to. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently the cleaner gasoline is used in all or part of 16  
states: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, 
Kentucky, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New 
York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Virginia and Wisconsin.

<HEADLINE> Low Oil Prices Drain BP Amoco Profit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- BP Amoco reported Tuesday its operating profits  
fell 47 percent during the first quarter because of low prices for 
crude oil. 
</P>
<P>
	The oil company said it had operating profits of $677 million,  
down from $1.28 billion a year earlier. When one-time items, 
including a $860 million restructuring charge, are included, BP 
lost $183 million, compared to earnings of $1.33 billion a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The restructuring charge was related to British Petroleum's  
purchase last year of Chicago-based Amoco Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	BP Amoco said higher sales volumes in all its business segments  
helped offset the lower prices for oil, which took a toll on 
profits throughout the oil industry 
</P>
<P>
	Prices have rallied following OPEC's mid-March agreement to  
curtail output,but the improvement came too late to affect 
first-quarter results. 
</P>
<P>
	``Prices are likely to remain firm if there is continued (OPEC)  
compliance with lower production levels,'' BP Amoco said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief executive John Browne said is seeing benefits from the  
merger trickling down to the bottom line. ``This is a good debut 
result for BP Amoco in a tough environment,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The group's exploration and production division saw operating  
profit decline 26 percent to $904 million, after adjustment for 
special charges of $86 million. Lower prices for oil and natural 
gas were somewhat offset by lower costs, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	In refining and marketing, weaker market conditions outweighed  
cost reductions and higher sales volumes to trigger a 33 percent 
drop in adjusted operating profit. Browne warned that downstream 
margins are likely to remain pressured this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Fewer plant shutdowns and greater volumes helped the chemicals  
business improve from last year's fourth quarter. However, adjusted 
operating profit of $217 million marked a 37 percent drop from the 
first three months of 1998.

<HEADLINE> Gov't. Issues Railroad Safety Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government has released its first  
comprehensive list of federal passenger railroad standards. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules, released Monday by the Federal Railroad  
Administration, spell out a variety of safety requirements that 
will have to be met by Amtrak, commuter railroads and other 
short-haul operators in metropolitan and suburban areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those exempted are subway systems, while different rules  
will be crafted for tourist, excursion and historic railroads. 
</P>
<P>
	To date passenger railroads have operated under a loose knit set  
of federal rules. In many respects, they have been responsible for 
establishing their own safety standards. 
</P>
<P>
	The new rules:  
</P>
<P>
	--Establish comprehensive structural standards for passenger rail  
equipment, including the type of crash impact that cars must 
withstand. 
</P>
<P>
	--Enhance fire standards.  
</P>
<P>
	--Outline specific requirements for passenger car emergency  
escapes. 
</P>
<P>
	--Set standards for the inspection and testing of a car's  
mechanical components. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1984, the railroad administration issued guidelines  
recommending test methods and performance standards for 
flammability and smoke emission characteristics of materials in 
passenger cars. Updated in 1989, the guidelines have been followed 
on a voluntary basis by passenger railroads. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on Monday's announcement, they will now become law.  
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak, the nation's only intercity passenger railroad, withheld  
immediate comment on the new rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just got this, so there are a number of areas we have to  
look into in terms of the impact it will have on Amtrak,'' said 
spokesman John Wolf.

<HEADLINE> Jerry West Mulls Future With Lakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- In what has become an annual rite of  
spring around these parts, Jerry West addressed speculation his 
lengthy front-office career with the Los Angeles Lakers may be 
nearing an end. 
</P>
<P>
	West, who turns 61 later this month, told NBC Sunday he wouldn't  
be holding his job of executive vice president with the Lakers much 
longer. 
</P>
<P>
	In a rare interview session, West said Tuesday he didn't know if  
he would complete the four-year contract extension he signed last 
September, a deal that runs through the 2002-2003 season and 
reportedly is worth $3.5 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been an incredible love for me. To even think about  
walking away from it, that's very painful,'' West said. ``I have 
made some promises to Shaquille O'Neal. He's like family to me. the 
most important thing is to have enthusiasm for this job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal, who signed a six-year contract with the Lakers in 1996  
and is finishing his third season with the team, could exercise a 
clause allowing him to become a free agent this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him I'd be here,'' West said. ``He made a commitment to  
us. I really want to see us win a championship with him here. I 
really believe he's going to retire as an LA player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal said Monday there was ``a 97 percent chance I'll be back  
here next year. But I'm not even thinking about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles led Houston 1-0 in their best-of-5 first-round  
series heading into Tuesday night's game. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked about recent speculation that he might take a  
front-office job with the New York Knicks, West smiled and said, 
``Fellas, I'm not going anywhere. I'm going to live in Los Angeles. 
I'm not looking for another job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	West starred for the Lakers for 14 seasons before retiring in  
1974. He later coached the team for three years, and has been in 
charge of the club's basketball operations for 17 years, the 
longest tenure in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	As he did last year, West said his relationship with Lakers  
owner Jerry Buss was solid even though the two disagreed at times. 
</P>
<P>
	``This guy's been so great to me,'' West said. ``I can't tell  
you how great he's been. When I read about a deteriorating 
relationship, that really bothers me. He's really been a committed 
owner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the disagreements between West and Buss came over the  
signing of Dennis Rodman, who joined the Lakers in late February 
and was waived seven weeks later after several incidents. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really like Dennis,'' West said. ``There's nothing wrong  
with Dennis, he's a nice guy. I didn't think he was a good fit. It 
put a terrible burden on Kurt (Rambis) as a coach. I didn't think 
it was a good fit for (Rodman).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rambis was hired to succeed Del Harris on the same day Rodman  
played in his first game for the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I pretty much say to Jerry what I think,'' West said of the  
owner. ``It is his team. He wants to win a championship. He thought 
it would bring us a step closer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the 30-minute interview session ended, West wanted addressed  
recent reports he had taken a lower profile. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hadn't disappeared,'' he said. ``I've always been here.''

<HEADLINE> Gun Makers, Anti-Gun Groups Unite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some of the nation's toughest anti-gun groups  
are joining with their historic enemy, gun manufacturers, to warn 
that the safety locks touted by President Clinton and others to 
fight youth violence can offer a false -- even dangerous -- sense of 
security. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're doing a tremendous disservice to consumers if we say,  
`Just run out and get a safety lock, and you'll be safe,''' said 
Kristen Rand of the anti-gun Violence Policy Center. She said some 
are made of such flimsy plastic they can easily be crushed. 
</P>
<P>
	``In some of the ways the president portrays them, he sends a  
wrong message. They're not childproof,'' agreed Robert Delfay, 
president of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, which 
represents gun and ammunition makers. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet as the nation seeks ways to keep guns from children after  
the Littleton, Colo., shootings, proposals to make safety locks 
mandatory are gaining new support, even from critics like Delfay 
and Rand, who see them as imperfect. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats in Congress, backed by Clinton, will press in Senate  
debate this week to make locks mandatory. Even some Republicans 
call them acceptable. And a flurry of lawsuits by cities and by 
victims of previous school shootings cite lack of gun locks as 
evidence of manufacturers' negligence. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides generally agree that gun locks address only a  
limited, although serious, problem: The 200 or so children killed 
and more than 1,000 injured each year in gun accidents. Both sides 
believe a gun lock won't deter a determined thief. 
</P>
<P>
	Trigger locks, the most widely used, fasten like a sandwich  
around a trigger to prevent it from being pulled. Cable locks 
thread through the gun's action, preventing it from going off. Some 
work with keys, others with combinations. Guns also can be locked 
in boxes or safes, Delfay notes. 
</P>
<P>
	All have drawbacks.  
</P>
<P>
	Gun groups worry that locks can hamstring a person trying to  
fend off a surprise intruder. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost all manufacturers warn they should be used only on  
unloaded guns -- and in fact, can cause a loaded gun to fire 
accidentally. One company, Saf-T-Lok Inc., has drawn attention by 
insisting its device works on a loaded gun. The Boston police 
department recently bought Saf-T-Loks for its officers to use while 
off-duty, but Beretta USA Corp. says it tested the locks and found 
them unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their purpose is to enable people to leave their guns loaded  
and even accessible to children,'' says Jeff Reh, Beretta's general 
counsel. ``That is a step backward from the conceptual idea of 
making sure guns are unloaded and away from children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, lawyers for the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence  
plan to cite Saf-T-Lok, in lawsuits on behalf of New Orleans, 
Atlanta and other cities, as evidence that gun makers still 
negligently shun expensive state-of-the-art technology. 
</P>
<P>
	The gun industry replies that advocates exaggerate, for  
political purposes, the available technology and the 
as-yet-undeveloped promise of ``smart guns'' that could identify a 
gun's owner through fingerprints, denying anyone else the ability 
to fire it. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite such fights, several gun manufacturers voluntarily have  
begun shipping locks with their firearms. Beretta began after an 
October 1997 meeting at the White House where Clinton, appearing 
with eight top gun-makers, announced voluntary agreement to include 
locks with new guns. 
</P>
<P>
	Police departments nationwide also increasingly provide locks  
both to officers and citizens. Bridgeport, Conn., has given 500 to 
citizens since February. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the city lawsuits, the families of four students  
and a teacher killed in the March 1998 Jonesboro, Ark., school 
shootings have sued two gun makers, saying the weapons used by the 
two youthful attackers, taken from the home of one boy's 
grandfather, were defective because they didn't have locks. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress this week is to debate measures, proposed by Clinton  
and Senate Democrats, to mandate child-safety locks on all guns 
sold, raise the legal age for handgun possession from 18 to 21 and 
impose background checks on buyers at all gun-show sales. A 
proposal to require safety locks failed last year. 
</P>
<P>
	While criticizing Clinton's proposals as ``knee-jerk reaction,''  
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., has appeared to leave 
open the door to some restrictions, specifically child locks. Gun 
makers say they can support a proposal, depending on specifics. The 
National Rifle Association, the largest gun-owners' organization, 
opposes mandatory locks. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats and most anti-gun groups, including Handgun Control  
Inc., acknowledge locks won't solve all problems but contend they 
can prevent harm if the government sets minimum standards. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we are trying to focus on are things that can make a  
difference -- and that can pass Congress,'' said Sen. Charles 
Schumer, D-N.Y. ``And trigger locks meet both of those 
conditions.''

<HEADLINE> Cat Thief Could Capture Preakness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Even if Charismatic doesn't come up with a  
suitable encore in the Preakness, there's still a chance that D. 
Wayne Lukas will be smiling broadly in the winner's circle. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because his other entrant, Cat Thief, could very well  
steal the show Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cat Thief took third in the Kentucky Derby, his 11th straight  
finish in the money since his maiden run in April 1998. He 
challenged for the lead from the outset and never dropped lower 
than second place before fading in the stretch and coming in less 
than a length behind Menifee. 
</P>
<P>
	Cat Thief ran a fine race, but was clearly overshadowed by his  
stablemate. Charismatic, a 31-1 longshot, rallied from seventh 
place to give Lukas his fourth Derby winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas, who was to arrive with both colts at Pimlico today, took  
a diplomatic approach in assessing the chances of his horses in the 
Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since they've got different owners, you can't pick between  
them,'' he said. ``You don't want to hurt anyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The focus will be on Charismatic, of course, because he's the  
only horse in the field with a chance to win the Triple Crown. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems like when you win the Derby, everyone tries to figure  
out a way to beat you,'' Lukas said. ``This race may not suit him 
as well as the Derby. On the other hand, he's sharper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic ran five furlongs in 1:01 Tuesday, his final workout  
before being shipped to Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	Another notable trainer with designs of making some noise in the  
Preakness is Carl Nafzger, who will saddle Vicar with hopes that 
the colt's 18th-place finish in the Derby can be attributed 
entirely to an awful position in the starting gate (17th). 
</P>
<P>
	After watching the horse run five furlongs in 59 3-5 seconds at  
Churchill Downs on Tuesday, Nafzger declared Vicar primed and ready 
to go. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's steadier, more focused in what he's doing,'' Nafzger  
said. ``I was super impressed. I just hope we get a better post 
position. Regardless, with 14 horses we have a better shot at 
getting some rhythm going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Baffert, meanwhile, remained steadfast in his assertion that  
he will wait to decide what to do with his two talented fillies 
until after this afternoon's Preakness draw. Baffert has entered 
Silverbulletday and Excellent Meeting in both the Preakness and 
Friday's Black-Eyed Susan Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Excellent Meeting finished fifth in the Derby; Silverbulletday  
won the Kentucky Oaks one day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're buddies, real good friends,'' Baffert said. ``Who'd  
ever think they'd be pals like that? I'm sure they discussed their 
races with each other in the barn.''

<HEADLINE> In Funds, Know That You Don't Know </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- One of the first rules for success in mutual  
fund investing is to know what you don't know. 
</P>
<P>
	If you are like most people not endowed with the ability to see  
the future, you don't know what stock prices or interest rates are 
going to do next week, next month or next year. 
</P>
<P>
	But you don't have to be discouraged by this realization.  
Indeed, amid this lack of knowledge, you possess a valuable piece 
of information that many people fail to capitalize on: You know 
that you're in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
	So you won't lead yourself astray by guessing, or pretending to  
possess knowledge you don't have. For instance, you will be less 
inclined to jump in and out of the market constantly if you don't 
put much credence in any prediction, yours or somebody else's, 
about what's likely to happen next. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of helter-skelter market timing, an ``I-don't-know''  
portfolio is likely to rely heavily on diversification, which is 
usually the best protection available against the uncertainties 
posed by the future. 
</P>
<P>
	You will probably put some of your money into stocks or stock  
funds, just in case the stock market keeps prospering. You will 
also probably keep some money out of stocks, socking it away in 
bond funds or money market funds, just in case the stock market 
doesn't keep prospering. 
</P>
<P>
	Quite possibly, you will divide that non-stock money between  
bond funds and money funds, keeping you in a balanced position 
whether interest rates rise, fall, or stay the same. 
</P>
<P>
	Most modern fund managers have long since joined the ``don't  
know'' club. When they are asked for a market forecast, they 
decline to give one, saying they prefer to focus on things that can 
be analyzed, such as the business prospects of individual 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	That's a big change from 10 or 20 years ago, when money managers  
who were asked about the future of the Dow Jones industrial average 
were expected to come up with an answer that sounded good. Today's 
managers are more sophisticated than that -- and so are many of 
their shareholder-clients. 
</P>
<P>
	All that having been said, it still can be entertaining and  
informative to watch investment professionals trying to peer into 
the future. Consider how several fund-family executives responded 
at a recent symposium when challenged for ``fearless forecasts'' by 
panel moderator Myron Kandel, the longtime financial editor at CNN 
Business News: 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Storms, president of Mitchell Hutchins Asset Management,  
predicted that fund industry assets, which recently surpassed $5 
trillion, will reach $10 trillion or more in the next five years or 
so. ``The next 10 years, or possibly 15 years, will be years of 
rapid growth,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, Jeffrey Shames, chairman of MFS Investment  
Management in Boston, said he saw signs that the growth of funds 
had leveled off. ``This has become a mature industry,'' he said, 
and predicted that it would have to contend with a bear market some 
time in the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Johnson, president of Franklin Resources Inc., which  
manages the Franklin, Templeton and Mutual Shares fund groups, 
focused on the frustrations fund managers have felt in recent years 
trying to outperform index funds patterned on the Standard &AMP; Poor's 
500-stock composite. 
</P>
<P>
	``I predict over the next 10 years that active managers will  
outperform the S&AMP;P index substantially,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the course of the panel discussion, sponsored by the Forum  
For Investor Advice, a trade group for funds sold through brokers 
and other advisers, Johnson also voiced concern about investors' 
high expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in a raging bull market,'' he said. ``We hope the  
expectations that the customer has are realistic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That comment pointed up the beauty of a ``don't-know'' approach  
to fund investing. If you know that what has happened in the recent 
past provides no guarantee of what is going to happen in the 
future, you're less likely to be surprised or disappointed by 
whatever events do occur. 
</P>
<P>
	Or, to put it another way, tempering your expectations by  
remembering that you don't know the future helps protect you from 
getting caught off guard.

<HEADLINE> Illegal Weapons Bought at Gun Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- State Justice Department agents found  
illegal weapons so easy to buy at a Los Angeles County gun show 
that they ran out of money after checking a handful of booths. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were readily available, all sorts of illegal weapons,''  
Attorney General Bill Lockyer said Tuesday, describing the 
undercover operation at the Great Western Gun Show in Pomona two 
weekends ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Gun shows have come under increased scrutiny since authorities  
revealed that weapons used in the Colorado high school massacre 
were purchased at shows, which are under less regulation that gun 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the laws regarding gun show sales are stricter in  
California, agents said there was still plenty of people selling 
banned weapons, and also selling legal weapons improperly. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockyer displayed nonfunctioning replicas of what the agents  
bought, including modified assault weapons and even a rocket 
launcher, at a news conference. Investigators also found 
flame-throwers and kits to convert legal guns into illegal 
automatic weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Agents ran out of the $4,000 allocated for their operation so  
quickly that they could check only a fraction of the 5,300 booths 
at the gun show, which is billed as largest in the West. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockyer said charges will be filed this week against those who  
sold the weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, agents said they witnessed the selling of handguns  
to people who were not asked to wait 10 days for a background 
check, as required by state law. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one asked for any background checks, waiting periods, no  
paperwork,'' Lockyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chad Seger, operations manager of the gun show, said he had ``a  
lot of questions'' about Lockyer's allegations, including whether 
weapons were purchased from people with booths at the show, or from 
other customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had tons of security, including Pomona police, fairgrounds  
police, and our own security people, who are weapons experts,'' 
working to enforce the law, Seger said.

<HEADLINE> No Kill on Makah Tribe Whale Hunt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEAH BAY, Wash. (AP) -- The first harpoon toss shot harmlessly  
over the top of a gray whale as it rolled in the Pacific, on the 
first day of whale hunting by Makah Indians this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven Indians in a 32-foot cedar canoe had intended only to  
practice on Monday, but protesters who oppose their plans to kill 
gray whales were closing in. As a result, the tribe issued a 10-day 
hunting permit that requires other vessels to stay at least 500 
yards away, said Keith Johnson, chairman of the Makah Whaling 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the tribe's arrangement with the Coast Guard, the Makah  
can declare such a zone for safety reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The harpoon shot missed because ``the whale rolled and the  
harpoon went over the top,'' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The whaling crew prepared this morning to head back to sea for  
another try, but a forecast for rain and wind during the day could 
be a problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Two members of the anti-whaling group Sea Defense Alliance were  
arrested Monday for investigation of assault. One of two protest 
boats was seized and towed to the Coast Guard station in Neah Bay, 
the northernmost tip of the Lower 48 states. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacob Conroy, 23, of Seattle and Josh Harper, 24, of Eugene,  
Ore., are accused of throwing smoke bombs, shooting chemical fire 
extinguishers into the faces of the Makah whalers, shooting flares 
over the bow of the canoe and threatening the lives of the whaling 
crew. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did it for the whales,'' Harper said as he and Conroy were  
led to a sheriff's van for transport to jail in Port Angeles, about 
50 miles east. 
</P>
<P>
	The Makah, whose whaling tradition dates back centuries, were  
granted the right to whale under an 1855 treaty. The hunts stopped 
in the 1920s because commercial whaling had brought gray whales to 
the brink of extinction. 
</P>
<P>
	When grays were taken off the Endangered Species List in 1994,  
the tribe moved to resume the hunts. The federal government 
supported their bid before the International Whaling Commission, 
which has banned commercial whaling since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	The Makah were allocated 20 whales through 2004 -- a maximum of  
five per year. They are prohibited from selling edible whale parts. 
</P>
<P>
	The tribe was cleared to whale hunt last October and issued a  
10-day hunting permit the following month. Weather, equipment and 
other problems prevented the novice crew from landing one of the 
40-ton mammals during the migration from Alaska to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan is to strike a whale with a harpoon, then finish it off  
with a .50-caliber rifle.

<HEADLINE> Fasteners Bill Passes House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Manufacturers of industrial fasteners would be  
required to state the strength and characteristics of their 
products, and would face criminal prosecution for lying about them, 
under legislation the House passed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters said the bill would lighten the regulatory burden on  
smaller businesses imposed by the 1990 Fastener Quality Act. That 
law, enacted to keep foreign manufacturers from dumping substandard 
fasteners in the U.S. market, required that all threaded, metallic, 
through-hardened fasteners of at least one-quarter-inch diameter be 
tested or documented by a laboratory certified by the National 
Institute of Standards &AMP; Technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Tuesday's bill, fasteners manufactured in accordance with  
accepted quality assurance systems would be deemed in compliance 
with the law. It also would require manufacturers to mark virtually 
all fasteners with registered trademarks. 
</P>
<P>
	To reduce paperwork, the bill would allow them to submit  
documents in electronic form. 
</P>
<P>
	Enforcement of the 1990 bill was delayed until June 1999 because  
of the requirement's impact on the economy, Rep. James 
Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., said during debate from the House floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Fastener Quality Act in its current form is unworkable,''  
Sensenbrenner said. Rep. Gil Gutknecht, R-Minn., characterized the 
law as ``a $20 solution to a $5 problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 1183.

<HEADLINE> Jury Selection Begins in Flynt Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Lawyers today began questioning dozens of  
prospective jurors who may have to watch as many as 40 hours of 
XXX-rated videos in the obscenity trial of Hustler magazine 
publisher Larry Flynt. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury will have to determine whether videos sold at Flynt's  
downtown store meet the community standards test set by the U.S. 
Supreme Court in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	Flynt, who was convicted of pandering obscenity here 22 years  
ago, thinks a contemporary jury would be less inclined to convict 
him again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not saying Cincinnati's a dramatically different city than  
it was in 1977,'' Flynt said. ``I'm just saying two new generations 
have come along and they're more tolerant, and I think that's 
probably a key.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flynt, 56, and his brother, Jimmy, 52, were indicted in April  
1998 on charges of pandering obscenity, disseminating material 
harmful to a juvenile, conspiracy and engaging in a pattern of 
corrupt activity. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges stem from the alleged sale of a sexually explicit  
video to a 14-year-old boy at the Hustler Magazine &AMP; Gifts store 
that Jimmy Flynt manages. If convicted, each brother could get 24 
years in prison and $65,000 in fines. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton County Common Pleas Judge Patrick Dinkelacker said the  
trial could take four or five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's session was brief, as Dinkelacker attempted to reduce a  
jury pool of 65 to those most likely to be chosen. He readily 
dismissed 18 who said they might face some kind of personal or 
financial hardship by serving on such a long trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Dinkelacker sent the remaining 47 to fill out detailed  
questionnaires. They were asked whether they rent videos, what news 
shows they like and how often they watch Jerry Springer, a popular 
talk show host and former Cincinnati mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense said Springer fans on the jury would be open-minded  
and comfortable with frank discussion of sex issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial, originally set for Jan. 19, has been rescheduled  
twice because Flynt, who has been in a wheelchair since he was shot 
in 1978, needed surgery for a urological problem related to his 
paralysis and also developed pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
	Flynt was convicted in 1977 of pandering obscenity for selling  
Hustler magazine in Cincinnati. He served six days of a 7- to 
25-year sentence and was released pending appeal, and the 
conviction was overturned in 1979.

<HEADLINE> North Korea's Famine May Be Easing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- The worst of North Korea's famine may have passed  
and large-scale starvation will probably be averted this year, a 
U.N. official said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tun Myat, director of resources for the U.N.'s World Food  
Program, and WFP donors who visited North Korea in early May 
believe 1997 was the worst year in the four-year famine, although 
they found no evidence that the cycle of famine and aid dependence 
will end soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Food aid is, however, getting to those who need it, and North  
Koreans are now producing ``alternative foods'' -- typically meal 
made from ground husks, stalks and wild plants -- on a large scale, 
said Tun Myat. 
</P>
<P>
	Although such diets provide little nutrition and may lead to  
intestinal problems, they help prevent large-scale starvation, Tun 
Myat said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, '' `A famine in slow motion' was how I depicted  
the situation. I have no reason to change that other than to say 
maybe that the slow is getting even slower,'' Tun Myat said. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea's food stocks ran out early last month, and May and  
June will be ``hungry months,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	WFP is distributing 200,000 tons of wheat in those months to  
children under 12, hospitals, nursing mothers and 1.65 million 
persons participating in food-for-work programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Four years of food shortages have forced the highly secretive  
communist country to open up slightly. North Korea released to aid 
officials figures showing that 220,000 people died of famine 
between 1995 and 1998, Tun Myat said. 
</P>
<P>
	The organization is still checking the accuracy of North Korea's  
estimates. U.S. and South Korean estimates put the number at 2 
million to 3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	But even the release of the figures is ``highly significant,''  
Tun Myat said. North Korea used to refuse comment entirely on 
famine dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Donors are also being taken to parts of the country that were  
once off-limits to foreigners and allowed to visit farms and meet 
with families, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korean officials have stopped insisting that the famine  
was caused solely by natural disasters, admitting to the delegation 
that it resulted partly from the loss of foreign trade in the early 
1990s after the former Soviet Union collapsed, Tun Myat said.

<HEADLINE> La. Bus Driver Had Medical Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- The driver of the bus that veered from a  
six-lane highway, killing 22 people, reportedly suffers from 
diabetes and other problems and might fail his next physical exam, 
a state licensing official said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``If his condition is as serious as we have been hearing since  
the accident, he probably wouldn't pass a test,'' said Kay 
Covington, the head of the state Office of Motor Vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	However, there was no way to tell today whether Frank Bedell's  
health problems contributed to the wreck Sunday morning, as he 
headed toward a casino on Mississippi's Gulf Coast with 43 
passengers, most of them elderly. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-two people were killed and 15 others were still  
hospitalized Monday. including Bedell, in what officials called the 
worst motor vehicle accident in New Orleans history. 
</P>
<P>
	Bedell's mother, Evelyn Bedell, said her son began dialysis in  
the last three months, because his kidneys failed. 
</P>
<P>
	Bedell, 49, also is diabetic. But diabetics who do not need to  
take insulin shots can get commercial licenses, Ms. Covington said. 
She said he passed the required medical exam in 1995, and his next 
was due this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Drivers don't have to report new medical problems or any  
deterioration in condition between renewals, said Stephen Quidd, 
attorney for the state motor vehicles division. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if they should, considering the accident, Quidd said:  
``It's probably something we'll want to study. But it is not as 
simple an issue as you might think. It gets complicated, especially 
in the area of liability. Who is responsible if the employee does 
not do it? The employer? The physician? A neighbor who might have 
knowledge?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bedell's mother told The Times-Picayune on Monday that her son  
began missing a lot of work after he began dialysis, and Custom Bus 
Charters officials asked him to go on disability. 
</P>
<P>
	Bus company officials would not talk about Bedell's medical  
condition, or what they knew about it or when. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the victims of the Mother's Day crash were in their 70s  
and 80s. Two were over 90. All but one were from the towns of 
LaPlace, Reserve and Edgard in St. John the Baptist Parish, about 
25 miles west of New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	And 81-year-old Marion Mancuso, called ``Mae'' by her friends,  
was one of the most enthusiastic for the regular casino trips, 
which participants said were more for socializing than for winning 
at gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	``What can you say?'' asked Martha Hymel, a resident of the  
Place Dubourg retirement home where Ms. Mancuso lived. ``She said 
she was going to the casino even if she had to be rolled in a 
wheelchair.'' Ms. Mancuso was one of those who died. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's so many questions, the hows and the whys,'' said Rose  
Garnet, whose 82-year-old mother, Florence Mathieu, another Place 
Dubourg resident, also died. ``We're just trying to get past 
this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Juanita Marse, 73, and her husband, Arto, 74, made the casino  
trip about once a month from Reserve, said Nancy Desselle, their 
daughter. They rarely won more than $10, but they loved getting 
together with other people their age. 
</P>
<P>
	``They would play games on the bus,'' Ms. Desselle said. ``They  
looked forward to the trip as much as the casino, the friendliness 
of it.''

<HEADLINE> Gov't Halts Duke Testing Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- The federal government has ordered Duke  
University Medical Center to halt any expansion of its 
government-funded human testing because the hospital has not 
corrected problems with its review board. 
</P>
<P>
	The ordered was issued by the federal Office for Protection from  
Research Risks, a division of the National Institutes of Health. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke was told not to enroll new subjects in federally funded  
experiments because administrators had failed to take sufficient 
corrective steps requested following a December review. 
</P>
<P>
	``Research activities involving previously enrolled subjects may  
continue only where it is in the best interests of individual 
subjects.'' Dr. Michael Carome, the federal research protection 
agency's chief of compliance, said in a letter Monday to the Duke 
medical center's top administrator. 
</P>
<P>
	Problems center on Duke's Institutional Review Board, which  
reviews research proposals for scientific validity and ethical 
soundness. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, Duke was told to rectify a number of problems,  
including insufficient training of review board members, potential 
financial conflicts of interest with board members, meetings with 
too few members, and poor record-keeping. 
</P>
<P>
	The school's response was deemed inadequate. But Duke said the  
action was not due to improper care of research patients. 
</P>
<P>
	``We regret the need for OPRR's decision, but we agree with the  
importance of the administrative changes the agency has 
identified,'' Dr. Ralph Snyderman, Duke's chancellor for health 
affairs, said in a statement Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke said it submitted a plan for making the required changes in  
February, and progress reports in March and April. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke has about 2,000 clinical trials underway involving  
thousands of patients. Duke received $228 million in 1998 for 
federal and non-governmental research, with tens of millions of 
dollars for human clinical trials. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinical trials are the tests performed on humans to evaluate  
how well new medicines or techniques work and whether there are 
negative effects. The process is required by the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration before any new drug or device can be made widely 
available.

<HEADLINE> Kings Promise More Intense Play  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- While the Utah Jazz accused them of  
taking cheap shots, the Sacramento Kings proudly displayed their 
battle scars Tuesday and promised more physical play in their 
first-round playoff series. 
</P>
<P>
	The upstart Kings, a game after getting blown out by 30 points,  
displayed Jazz-like tenacity to even the series at one game apiece 
and earn a chance to wrap up the best-of-5 series at home in games 
Wednesday and Friday nights. 
</P>
<P>
	Sacramento allowed the most points in the NBA this season, often  
focusing on fancy passes and crowd-pleasing plays instead of 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
	But not in its 101-90 victory at Salt Lake City on Monday night,  
when Chris Webber dropped John Stockton with a forearm just seconds 
into the game and the Kings maintained that intensity for most of 
the contest. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, after practice at Arco Arena, the Kings were still  
bruised and battered. Jon Barry had floor burns on his elbows and 
knees. Vlade Divac had a swollen elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	Webber, who missed several games at the end of the regular  
season with a strained lower back, had to be helped off the court 
late in the fourth quarter Monday night but practiced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, it was a little stiff at the start, but as I practiced  
it got looser,'' said Webber, who had two big buckets down the 
stretch among his 20 points Monday. ``It depends on what position 
on how much it hurts, but mostly it feels pretty good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even though Utah's Karl Malone ridiculed Webber for hitting  
Stockton, saying the 6-foot-10 Webber should be picking on someone 
his own size instead of a point guard, Webber defended his flagrant 
foul on Stockton. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll play the bad guy for our team if it helps us win,'' he  
said, then alluded to allegations of overly physical play by 
Stockton and other Jazz players in the past. ``Are they the dirty 
team or are we the dirty team?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though Utah players were angered by Webber's hit, they also were  
frustrated at their own lack of intensity in Game 2. Jazz guard 
Jeff Hornacek said the 117-87 win in Saturday's series opener may 
have led to a sense of complacency. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess a 30-point win is not the greatest thing to have. You  
have a tendency to relax and think, 'That was easy,''' he said. 
``They're sky-high now. They probably never thought they'd go back 
1-and-1 to their home court. We gave them all kinds of life, and 
those are the toughest teams to beat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Kings, greeted by about 500 fans when their plane landed in  
Sacramento just before midnight, said playing at home may not be 
such a huge advantage against a veteran team such as the Jazz. 
</P>
<P>
	``Utah knows what it's all about to play on the road in the  
playoffs. They've played through it for a lot of years,'' said 
coach Rick Adelman, whose Kings are in the playoffs for just the 
second time in 13 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Sacramento has never won a home playoff game. The last time the  
Kings won at home in the playoffs was in 1981, when they were based 
in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have the home court advantage now, and that's what they  
came here for,'' Jazz coach Jerry Sloan said after his team's 
workout Tuesday in Utah. ``We'll find out who we are and find out, 
I'm sure, who they are.''

<HEADLINE> Webb, Sorenstam Play Serious Golf  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Karrie Webb made the putt and smiled so wide she may have  
stretched a few dormant muscles. She punched the air with an 
uppercut. Then she laughed and headed for the tee to start the 
second round of the Titleholders Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	The practice green was merely a stage on which Webb mockingly  
rehearsed how to be the star everyone wants her to be. It was as if 
she were trying on clothes that made her look like someone she 
wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was growing up, my mom told me to be myself,'' Webb  
said. ``And if people don't like you, that's too bad. I'm being 
criticized for being the person I am. It's just unfortunate that 
the media doesn't like my personality, because that's basically 
what it boils down to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Webb wins as often as David Duval, which is a lot. Her victory  
in the Titleholders was her fourth of year in just 10 tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	She also shows about as much emotion on the golf course as  
Duval, which is not much. 
</P>
<P>
	And Webb has some company on the LPGA Tour.  
</P>
<P>
	Losing to Annika Sorenstam, for instance, has been compared to  
getting your butt kicked by Miss Manners. She has a shy smile and a 
sweet disposition, but is all business on the golf course. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I was a comedian, I'd be on VH-1,'' Sorenstam said. ``I  
come here to play golf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At some time or another, women will always be compared to their  
counterparts on the PGA Tour, and they will rarely appear to be as 
successful. The purses aren't as large, their drives aren't as 
long, the television exposure isn't nearly as great. 
</P>
<P>
	The bigger problem facing Webb and Sorenstam are comparisons to  
one of their own. 
</P>
<P>
	They may be the top two players in women's golf, but they are  
not Nancy Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will never be another Nancy Lopez. They come along once  
in a century,'' said Meg Mallon. ``As soon as we stop comparing 
everyone to Nancy, we can move forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the search for a star came grinding to a halt last week  
amid the storms during the Titleholders Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	The loudest clap of thunder came on the eve of the tournament,  
when defending champion Danielle Ammaccapane wondered why no one 
was willing to ``take the responsibility'' the way Lopez has the 
past 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're finding with all these girls is they're closing  
themselves down to everything and everybody, and not letting 
anybody get in,'' Ammaccapane said. ``People want to know the human 
side of an athlete. They want to hear what they don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Annika doesn't show very much emotion,'' she said. ``She has a  
way of doing things that is very effective, but it's hard to 
connote that. We need somebody like Nancy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As luck would have it, Ammaccapane and Sorenstam were paired in  
the first two rounds, which produced a slight cold front during an 
otherwise hot and humid week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just sorry she had to play with me,'' Sorenstam said, a  
brief departure from her otherwise pleasant nature. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that Ammaccapane is without fault.  
</P>
<P>
	When she won the Titleholders a year ago, she didn't want to  
talk about a horseback riding accident that nearly ended her 
career. Maybe she thought talking about a 4-foot par putt was much 
more compelling. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Danielle was stupid to say those things,'' said Laura  
Davies. ``What she was saying was possibly true, but she had no 
business saying it. It's unfortunate for our tour that they're not 
like Nancy Lopez, but their golf is second to none. They got to the 
top of the game doing it their way, and their way is not wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, their way could stand some improvements.  
</P>
<P>
	Lopez recalls being inundated by the media, especially during  
her record five straight victories as a rookie in 1978. She was 
tugged in every direction, and embraced the moment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always been pretty open,'' Lopez said. ``The press  
definitely made me who I am, by writing about me, my life, the 
human side of me. That's important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Webb doesn't want to carry the weight of the LPGA on her  
shoulders alone. She may always see the media as an obligation 
instead of an opportunity. That may have to change if she keeps 
winning everything in sight. 
</P>
<P>
	That doesn't mean Webb has to flash a smile that doesn't come  
naturally, or has to find a new personality to fit the profile of a 
star. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not ridiculous to expect people to do things for the  
tour,'' said Dottie Pepper. ``They should want to do that. But to 
ask somebody to a become person they're not is unfair.''

<HEADLINE> Furriers Fight 'Anti-Fur' Coat Tags </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Voters in this city of the  
well-heeled and the well-dressed decided Tuesday whether to require 
that all furs for sale carry a tag listing the gruesome ways in 
which the animal may have been killed. 
</P>
<P>
	It would be the first such ordinance in the nation.  
</P>
<P>
	The credit card-sized tags for furs costing more than $50 would  
carry warnings that the animals may have been electrocuted, gassed, 
poisoned, clubbed, stomped, drowned or snagged by steel-jawed 
traps. 
</P>
<P>
	Sellers would be fined $100 per item for violating the law.  
</P>
<P>
	The measure was the only issue on the ballot. The price tag for  
the special election was $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a terrible waste of money,'' said 60-year-old Judith  
Karlan, who cast her vote at the elegant Beverly Hills Hotel and 
walked down a red carpet to pick up her car from the valet. ``What 
is so important about this?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the measure raised $75,000 and sent 5,000  
videotapes to voters showing hidden camera footage of Beverly Hills 
fur merchants telling shoppers -- falsely, backers of the tag 
ordinance say -- that the animals were mercifully put to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
	The famous residents backing the measure included Jack Lemmon,  
Sid Caesar and Larry King. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents spent $81,000, saying the measure is an attack by  
animal rights extremists who want to hurt the fur industry. They 
also argued taht the ordinance would be difficult to enforce and a 
waste of time. 
</P>
<P>
	Behrouz Mahboubi, 55, who works in property management, called  
the measure ridiculous. ``How could a store or shopkeeper know 
where a coat is coming from, or how they kill the animal?'' he 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Turnout was expected to be high, with 5,500 of the city's 20,000  
registered voters requesting absentee ballots.

<HEADLINE> Panel Holds Cop Brutality Hearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. James Clyburn pledges that the  
Congressional Black Caucus' first hearing on police brutality will 
yield more than a report that will sit on a bookshelf and collect 
dust. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are focused on solutions,'' Clyburn, D-S.C., said Monday.  
``Panels like this often focus only on the horror stories, but we 
are talking solutions. We need to stay focused and achieve some 
meaningful results.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The caucus on Monday hosted the first of a planned national  
series of hearings on police brutality designed to measure whether 
the recent spate of high-profile deaths of young blacks at the 
hands of police are an aberration or a troubling new outgrowth of 
tougher policing policies nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Early in the five-hour hearing, the panel heard from  
representatives of the civil rights community, including National 
Urban League President Hugh Price and Raul Yzaguirre, president of 
the National Council of La Raza. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem isn't only excessive use of force but dragnet  
techniques'' that include racial profiling of suspects on traffic 
stops and the random stopping and frisking policies employed by New 
York City police, Price said. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Bill Lann Lee, acting assistant attorney general for  
civil rights, told the caucus members that although his office is 
limited in its ability to bring federal prosecutions in local 
police jurisdictions, it has reached settlements with the cities of 
Pittsburgh and Steubenville, Ohio, which were judged by the Justice 
Department to discriminate in policing. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee said investigations of the Washington, New York City and New  
Orleans police departments are continuing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have seen several tragedies in the last few months,'' Lee  
said. ``We have to see how we as a nation as a whole respond, not 
by pointing fingers but by moving forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses like Dorothy Elliott provided tearful testimony of how  
their loved ones died at the hands of police. Mrs. Elliott's son, 
Archie Elliott III, 24, was stopped by Prince George's County, Md., 
police in June 1995 for driving erratically. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Elliott, with his hands cuffed behind him in a  
police car, pointed a gun at them. The official version of events 
was that after refusing police orders to drop the gun, Elliott was 
shot 14 times and died. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can call it a tragedy, but I call it a murder,'' Mrs.  
Elliott sobbed. ``My son didn't resist arrest. My son's life had 
value.'' The shooting was ruled justified by authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Seated next to her was Saiko Diallo, whose son Amadou, a street  
vendor from Guinea, was killed Feb. 4 outside his apartment in the 
New York City borough of the Bronx when four white police officers 
fired 41 shots, striking him 19 times and making the young 
immigrant a national symbol of police abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	``The police officers have been indicted for (second-degree)  
murder,'' Diallo said in halting tones. ``But they are still 
working full time with a full salary. This is unfair. This is not 
right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clyburn said additional hearings are planned for New York, Los  
Angeles, Houston, Chicago and Atlanta.

<HEADLINE> Morning Show Stunts Suffer Setbacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hitting the road is a time-honored ratings stunt  
for morning news shows. But this week, the road is hitting back. 
</P>
<P>
	After enduring an uncomfortable night on the side of Mount  
Everest, Matt Lauer of NBC's ``Today'' show was prevented Tuesday 
from traveling to a second mystery location when the Indian 
government grounded his chartered plane. 
</P>
<P>
	Hostile weather in this country forced Charles Gibson, Diane  
Sawyer and the crew of ABC's ``Good Morning America'' to travel 10 
hours by bus from Austin, Texas, to New Orleans in time for 
Tuesday's show -- and another downpour. 
</P>
<P>
	Both shows are traveling to drum up interest during a ratings  
``sweeps'' month. For the second straight year, NBC's ``Where in 
the world is Matt Lauer'' promotion sends the anchorman on a 
week-long mystery tour to destinations unknown to viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	He made it to the slopes of the world's tallest mountain Monday,  
but it's been all downhill since. 
</P>
<P>
	Fog obscured views of the peak and prevented Lauer from leaving  
after Monday's show. He was stuck in a shack with his wife, model 
Annette Roque Lauer, eating ravioli and crackers, and sleeping in 
sleeping bags. There was no running water, only an outhouse 
accessible after a jog in the freezing cold. 
</P>
<P>
	The fog finally lifted enough for Lauer to get off the mountain  
and fly to Katmandu, Nepal. But he waited on a runway there for 
more than six hours when officials refused permission to fly over 
Indian airspace. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time Lauer finally took off, it was too late to reach his  
second destination in time for Tuesday's show, said Jeff Zucker, 
``Today'' executive producer. He was rerouted in the air to his 
planned third destination. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC scrambled overnight to fill time, calling former ``Partridge  
Family'' actor Danny Bonaduce after midnight for an interview on 
the perils of child stardom. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all part of the game,'' Zucker said. ``In order to score  
big, you've got to take big chances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Good Morning America'' picked Austin for its first stop in a  
bus tour of the South. But Gibson and Sawyer were planning to cheat 
Monday -- traveling by plane to Lafayette, La. -- and ride the bus 
from there to New Orleans. Instead, their plane was grounded and 
everyone had to make the long drive. 
</P>
<P>
	Lafayette, and about 2,000 people who were waiting to greet the  
crew, were bypassed. 
</P>
<P>
	In New Orleans, a downpour Tuesday forced ``GMA'' to move its  
broadcast site from the outdoor Jackson Square to the nearby 
Pontalbo Cafe. The Neville Brothers had to cancel a performance 
because their equipment was drenched, said Shelley Ross, the show's 
executive producer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were all calm,'' Ross said. ``A zen came over our  
production. In a funny way, I think we had a better show. It had 
energy and spontaneity.''

<HEADLINE> Tree Clearing Urged on Mass. Island </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- Clearing more than 1,100 acres of trees  
on Martha's Vineyard could restore habitat for rare plants and 
animals on one of New England's most unusual landscapes, according 
to a new study. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the state Department of Environmental Management,  
which runs the Manuel F. Correllus State Forest in the middle of 
the island, haven't approved the proposed clearing plan, but they 
agree with the study's goal, The Boston Globe reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Harvard University study comes amid growing concern over  
development on Martha's Vineyard, a popular vacation getaway and 
second-home market. More land has been developed in the last three 
decades than since it was first settled by Europeans 330 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1925, hundreds of acres of spruce and pine trees were planted  
in hopes of creating a lumber industry. The trees, which now cover 
23 percent of the 5,200-acre state forest, never grew well in the 
sandy soil, and the red pines began dying from disease in the 
1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers found the forest -- a rare sand plain where  
farmers had never tilled on a large scale -- even more ecologically 
valuable than previously believed. Farming destroys native plants, 
but tree plantations only gradually choked them off, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a huge area for a relatively small island and ...  
hidden by these (pine and spruce) plantations, there is this native 
landscape just ready to emerge,'' said David Foster, director of 
the Harvard Forest and co-author of the new report. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers offered no timetable for the clearing but  
recommended that the youngest spruce and pine trees, planted in the 
1960s, be removed immediately, along with the diseased trees. 
</P>
<P>
	One species that won't come back no matter what the scientists  
do is the heath hen, known for its booming mating calls, which once 
prospered on the island's sandy plains. It has been extinct since 
1932. Some Vineyard residents would like to import prairie chickens 
from the West as a replacement, because they are similar.

<P>
	Showers and thunderstorms formed over the middle third of the  
nation today while rain clouds hovered from Tennessee to Wyoming. 
Only the Southwest was expected to fully escape the gray skies. 
</P>
<P>
	While high pressure was expected to build over parts of the  
East, a slow moving storm system was forecast to dampen most of the 
Plains, particularly from Wisconsin to Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
	Rain showers and thunderstorms were expected over Wisconsin,  
Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi and Louisiana. Humid air 
from the Gulf Coast also could bring rain to Alabama, Georgia and 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Northern New England was forecast to be blustery across Maine  
and New Hampshire with some afternoon showers and sprinkles 
possible. The rest of the East was expected to be dry and fair. 
</P>
<P>
	An arc of low pressure in the nation's midsection was expected  
to bring a second day of storms from the Dakotas through northern 
Texas. Minnesota through Oklahoma also could be affected, while 
more scattered activity was predicted in Missouri, Arkansas and 
Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, wind gusts exceeding 60 mph accompanied storms in  
Texas, which also dumped hail up to three-quarters of an inch in 
diameter in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and along the Panhandle. 
</P>
<P>
	Rain from the northern Plains was forecast to spill into  
Montana, Wyoming and Colorado. Clouds and drizzle were predicted 
from Washington to California.

<HEADLINE>  NHL Playoffs Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Once Pavol Demitra became accustomed to the  
playoff grind, his game took off again. 
</P>
<P>
	Demitra, the St. Louis Blues' leading scorer in the regular  
season, continued a postseason surge when he beat Ed Belfour in 
overtime for a 3-2 victory over the Dallas Stars on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I scored almost 90 points and all of a sudden, I'm  
struggling,'' Demitra said. ``But I'm back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So are the Blues, who cut their series deficit against the NHL  
regular-season champions to 2-1 heading into Game 4 Wednesday night 
in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't wait,'' Demitra said. ``I'm so excited, I wish we can  
play right away. I'm just so pumped up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other Western Conference series continues tonight with  
Detroit playing host Colorado and holding a 2-0 lead. In the East, 
Toronto visits Pittsburgh tonight, and Boston is at Buffalo on 
Wednesday night. Both of those series are tied 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Demitra, who was 10th in the NHL with 89 points, has three goals  
and an assist in the last two games since making the adjustment to 
the tighter checking and close quarters of playoff competition. 
That represents half of his postseason output; before Monday, he 
was a team-worst minus-4. 
</P>
<P>
	In Game 3, he was plus-2 and also scored his first points in a  
Blues' playoff victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's worked harder in determination to come up with loose  
pucks and taking it to the net more,'' coach Joel Quenneville said. 
``And he's getting in place in the high-traffic areas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Demitra got to just such an area, outside the crease at the  
right side of the net, when he scored the winner at 2:43 of 
overtime off a feed from Geoff Courtnall. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time I'm on the ice with him, I feel I can score,''  
Demitra said. ``He fed me last year all the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues' third goal also was a Demitra production. After  
avoiding a check from Richard Matvichuk, Demitra slipped the puck 
to rookie Jochen Hecht, who slid in a backhander for a 2-1 lead at 
4:52 of the third. 
</P>
<P>
	Hecht and Mike Eastwood, who also scored for the Blues, were  
unlikely offensive sources. Hecht had a team-leading 56 points with 
the Worcester Icecats of the AHL, but wasn't summoned until 
Saturday after they were eliminated from the playoffs. Eastwood, a 
faceoff specialist, has seven goals in 62 career playoff games and 
two points in 10 playoff games this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of unsung heroes in the playoffs and we're  
getting that right now,'' Blues right wing Scott Young said. 
``That's why we've been successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars, the NHL regular-season champions with a  
franchise-record 114 points, missed a chance to put the Blues in a 
huge hole. Only two teams have recovered from a 3-0 series deficit, 
the last the New York Islanders in 1975 against Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas' team-record six-game playoff winning streak also came to  
an end. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to go 16-0,'' defenseman Derian Hatcher said.  
``You expect to lose a game here or there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brett Hull scored in his first postseason game in St. Louis  
since leaving the Blues after a decade of stardom last summer, and 
Darryl Sydor added his first of the playoffs for Dallas. A crowd of 
19,268, the Blues' first sellout of the playoffs, booed when Hull's 
name was announced. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues largely silenced Joe Nieuwendyk, who had an assist and  
only one shot. Nieuwendyk had two goals and an assist, including 
the game-winner in overtime, in Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars may be without center Jere Lehtinen in Game 4.  
Lehtinen injured his right knee in the second period and is listed 
as day-to-day. 
</P>
<P>
	Sydor forced the overtime with his first goal of the playoffs at  
9:08 of the third. Grant Fuhr got a glove on Pat Verbeek's drive 
from the slot, and Grant Marshall got his stick on the rebound 
before Sydor tapped it in. 
</P>
<P>
	A four-minute high-sticking penalty on Blues captain Chris  
Pronger, who caught Hatcher in the face, helped the Stars get off 
to a fast start. Hull scored his second goal of the playoffs, and 
only Dallas' third in 33 power-play opportunities, with a shot from 
the left circle at 3:07. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues got off only three shots in the first period, but tied  
it on a fluky goal at 2:58 of the second. Ricard Persson flipped 
the puck end-over-end toward the net and it deflected off 
Eastwood's glove and Sergei Zubov's stick before eluding Belfour. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues outshot the Stars 24-18 in regulation and took the  
only four shots in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't shoot enough,'' Stars forward Jamie Langenbrunner  
said. ``Instead of putting it on net, we passed.''

<HEADLINE>  NHL Playoffs Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Once Pavol Demitra became accustomed to the  
playoff grind, his game took off again. 
</P>
<P>
	Demitra, the St. Louis Blues' leading scorer in the regular  
season, continued a postseason surge when he beat Ed Belfour in 
overtime for a 3-2 victory over the Dallas Stars on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I scored almost 90 points and all of a sudden, I'm  
struggling,'' Demitra said. ``But I'm back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So are the Blues, who cut their series deficit against the NHL  
regular-season champions to 2-1 heading into Game 4 Wednesday night 
in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't wait,'' Demitra said. ``I'm so excited, I wish we can  
play right away. I'm just so pumped up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other Western Conference series continues tonight with  
Detroit playing host Colorado and holding a 2-0 lead. In the East, 
Toronto visits Pittsburgh tonight, and Boston is at Buffalo on 
Wednesday night. Both of those series are tied 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Demitra, who was 10th in the NHL with 89 points, has three goals  
and an assist in the last two games since making the adjustment to 
the tighter checking and close quarters of playoff competition. 
That represents half of his postseason output; before Monday, he 
was a team-worst minus-4. 
</P>
<P>
	In Game 3, he was plus-2 and also scored his first points in a  
Blues' playoff victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's worked harder in determination to come up with loose  
pucks and taking it to the net more,'' coach Joel Quenneville said. 
``And he's getting in place in the high-traffic areas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Demitra got to just such an area, outside the crease at the  
right side of the net, when he scored the winner at 2:43 of 
overtime off a feed from Geoff Courtnall. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time I'm on the ice with him, I feel I can score,''  
Demitra said. ``He fed me last year all the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues' third goal also was a Demitra production. After  
avoiding a check from Richard Matvichuk, Demitra slipped the puck 
to rookie Jochen Hecht, who slid in a backhander for a 2-1 lead at 
4:52 of the third. 
</P>
<P>
	Hecht and Mike Eastwood, who also scored for the Blues, were  
unlikely offensive sources. Hecht had a team-leading 56 points with 
the Worcester Icecats of the AHL, but wasn't summoned until 
Saturday after they were eliminated from the playoffs. Eastwood, a 
faceoff specialist, has seven goals in 62 career playoff games and 
two points in 10 playoff games this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of unsung heroes in the playoffs and we're  
getting that right now,'' Blues right wing Scott Young said. 
``That's why we've been successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars, the NHL regular-season champions with a  
franchise-record 114 points, missed a chance to put the Blues in a 
huge hole. Only two teams have recovered from a 3-0 series deficit, 
the last the New York Islanders in 1975 against Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas' team-record six-game playoff winning streak also came to  
an end. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to go 16-0,'' defenseman Derian Hatcher said.  
``You expect to lose a game here or there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brett Hull scored in his first postseason game in St. Louis  
since leaving the Blues after a decade of stardom last summer, and 
Darryl Sydor added his first of the playoffs for Dallas. A crowd of 
19,268, the Blues' first sellout of the playoffs, booed when Hull's 
name was announced. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues largely silenced Joe Nieuwendyk, who had an assist and  
only one shot. Nieuwendyk had two goals and an assist, including 
the game-winner in overtime, in Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars may be without center Jere Lehtinen in Game 4.  
Lehtinen injured his right knee in the second period and is listed 
as day-to-day. 
</P>
<P>
	Sydor forced the overtime with his first goal of the playoffs at  
9:08 of the third. Grant Fuhr got a glove on Pat Verbeek's drive 
from the slot, and Grant Marshall got his stick on the rebound 
before Sydor tapped it in. 
</P>
<P>
	A four-minute high-sticking penalty on Blues captain Chris  
Pronger, who caught Hatcher in the face, helped the Stars get off 
to a fast start. Hull scored his second goal of the playoffs, and 
only Dallas' third in 33 power-play opportunities, with a shot from 
the left circle at 3:07. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues got off only three shots in the first period, but tied  
it on a fluky goal at 2:58 of the second. Ricard Persson flipped 
the puck end-over-end toward the net and it deflected off 
Eastwood's glove and Sergei Zubov's stick before eluding Belfour. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues outshot the Stars 24-18 in regulation and took the  
only four shots in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't shoot enough,'' Stars forward Jamie Langenbrunner  
said. ``Instead of putting it on net, we passed.''

<HEADLINE> New Is Offer Made for the Penguins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Pittsburgh moved closer Tuesday to joining  
Hartford, Winnipeg, Quebec and other cities that lost NHL teams. 
</P>
<P>
	NHL lawyer Jeffrey Levitan said a person has offered $85 million  
to buy the Pittsburgh Penguins and move the franchise. Levitan did 
not reveal the identity of the potential buyer. 
</P>
<P>
	During a hearing on the league's request for quick work on the  
fate of the team, which is in U.S. Bankruptcy Court proceedings for 
the second time in 25 years, Levitan said the Penguins' assets also 
could be sold piecemeal to other teams, although he said that would 
bring in much less than $85 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets include players such as NHL scoring champion Jaromir  
Jagr. 
</P>
<P>
	The potential deal for the team would go through after the NHL  
terminates the franchise, Levitan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The mystery bid represents $35 million more than the offer from  
a group led by former Penguins star center Mario Lemieux and 
endorsed by the NHL. The team's 200 creditors could stand to earn 
more if the mystery bid goes through. 
</P>
<P>
	Chuck Greenberg, Lemieux's lawyer, said the assumption of debt  
will eventually make the Lemieux bid more attractive than the 
latest offer but would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not surprised that another party is interested in the  
team. There were a number of bidders who emerged the last time the 
league expanded,'' Greenberg said. ``We are not going to concern 
ourselves with what might happen if our bid is not confirmed. We 
want to put all our energies into making this a viable franchise in 
Pittsburgh.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Financial trouble under current owners Roger Marino and Howard  
Baldwin and uncertainty about the looming season have reduced the 
team's value, said William Daly, the league's vice president for 
legal affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are not ideal conditions under which to be selling a  
sports franchise,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A court and creditors' review of the NHL's plan to dissolve the  
Penguins has been scheduled for May 19, 12 days before the NHL's 
deadline for resolving Penguins' ownership and the same day as a 
possible Game 6 of Pittsburgh's series against Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly said the league wants to begin scheduling the 1999-2000  
season and needs to know how many teams it will have and whether 
they will travel to Pittsburgh or another city for games. 
</P>
<P>
	The league is using the prospect of losing the team to push the  
Penguins toward Lemieux and his investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not here to hasten the departure of the team,'' Daly  
said. ``Our priority is to keep the team in Pittsburgh. ... But 
time is a real issue here.''

<HEADLINE> Tenn. Jury Sides With Tobacco Cos. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- Big Tobacco cannot be forced to pay  
damages for the lung-cancer deaths of three former smokers, a jury 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Shelby County jury found Monday that the nation's three  
largest cigarette makers couldn't be conclusively linked to the 
deaths of two Memphis residents, and was only partly responsible 
for the third death. 
</P>
<P>
	The suits were filed by the families of Bobby Newcomb, a retired  
trucker who died last year at age 64; Florence Bruch, a 63-year-old 
homemaker who died in 1996; and James Karney, a retired trucker who 
was 71 when he died in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The three lawsuits, consolidated for a single trial, accused  
Philip Morris Inc., R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. and Brown &AMP; 
Williamson Tobacco Corp. of knowingly selling a dangerous product 
and conspiring to cover up that danger. 
</P>
<P>
	The families had been seeking more than $431,000 for medical  
bills and unspecified punitive damages that could have reached into 
the millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	The tobacco companies denied the three died because of smoking  
or that cigarettes are unreasonably dangerous. They also argued the 
three could have quit smoking if they wanted to. 
</P>
<P>
	James Johnson, a lawyer for R.J. Reynolds, said he was pleased  
that after four months of testimony the jury ``conscientiously 
applied the law to (the) evidence and determined that somebody who 
smokes, and being fully aware of the risks of smoking, ought not 
collect money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That argument resonated with juror Carrie Jester.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of like alcoholism. We know it's bad for you, but we  
make a decision to drink,'' Jester said after the verdict. ``It's 
the same with smoking. We know it's bad for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The jury decided Newcomb was at least 50 percent responsible for  
his cancer. Under Tennessee law, that means the tobacco companies 
could not be assessed damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Feldman, a tobacco analyst with Salomon Smith Barney,  
said a loss by the tobacco companies would have been especially 
painful since the cases were taken to trial in a conservative 
Southern city. 
</P>
<P>
	``This doesn't mean that litigation challenges don't remain.  
California and the West Cost generally remain a problem,'' Feldman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In similar cases this year a San Francisco woman with inoperable  
lung cancer was awarded $26.5 million and the family of a Portland, 
Ore., man who died of lung cancer was awarded $81 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Curtis Johnson Jr., a lawyer for the plaintiffs, vowed to  
continue taking the tobacco companies to court. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one case, this is one verdict and we'll be back  
again,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Beverly Hills Voters Mull Fur Tags </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Voters in this city of the  
well-heeled and the well-dressed decided Tuesday whether to require 
that all furs for sale carry a tag listing the gruesome ways in 
which the animal may have been killed. 
</P>
<P>
	It would be the first such ordinance in the nation.  
</P>
<P>
	With five of eight precincts counted, the proposal had 1,733  
votes in favor compared with 2,873 votes against, or 37.6 percent 
to 62.4 percent, said city spokeswoman Robin Chancellor. 
</P>
<P>
	The credit card-sized tags for furs costing more than $50 would  
carry warnings that the animals may have been electrocuted, gassed, 
poisoned, clubbed, stomped, drowned or snagged by steel-jawed 
traps. 
</P>
<P>
	Sellers would be fined $100 per item for violating the law.  
</P>
<P>
	The measure was the only issue on the ballot. The price tag for  
the special election was $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a terrible waste of money,'' said 60-year-old Judith  
Karlan, who cast her vote at the elegant Beverly Hills Hotel and 
walked down a red carpet to pick up her car from the valet. ``What 
is so important about this?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the measure raised $75,000 and sent 5,000  
videotapes to voters showing hidden camera footage of Beverly Hills 
fur merchants telling shoppers -- falsely, backers of the tag 
ordinance say -- that the animals were mercifully put to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
	The famous residents backing the measure included Jack Lemmon,  
Sid Caesar and Larry King. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents spent $81,000, saying the measure is an attack by  
animal rights extremists who want to hurt the fur industry. They 
also argued that the ordinance would be difficult to enforce and a 
waste of time. 
</P>
<P>
	Behrouz Mahboubi, 55, who works in property management, called  
the measure ridiculous. ``How could a store or shopkeeper know 
where a coat is coming from, or how they kill the animal?'' he 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Turnout was expected to be high, with 5,500 of the city's 20,000  
registered voters requesting absentee ballots.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Community Investments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- With 15 corporate chiefs in tow, President  
Clinton toured an inner-city market Tuesday in an effort to 
encourage investment in America's stubborn pockets of poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our economy is now in the best shape it's been in at least a  
generation; some people think it's the best economy America's ever 
had,'' the president said. But he said there still are ailing areas 
where ``there's been almost no new investment, almost no new 
businesses, almost no new jobs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton announced he will take business chief executives and  
members of Congress on a tour of depressed areas at the beginning 
of July. They will visit Appalachia, Indian reservations, the 
Mississippi Delta and struggling cities, such as Gary, Ind., 
Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo said. 
</P>
<P>
	After a White House greeting, Clinton loaded corporate  
executives onto Air Force One and flew them to Atlanta. The 
executives, accustomed to their own corporate jets, marveled at the 
furnishings on the president's plane, with its large bedroom, 
shower, conference room, private office, mini-hospital and dozens 
of telephones. 
</P>
<P>
	The visit returned Clinton's attention to domestic problems  
after a heavy focus on the air war against Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The CEOs accompanying Clinton Tuesday came from Citigroup, Bell  
South, American Airlines, Delta Airlines, Goldman Sachs, Aetna, 
AT&AMP;T Wireless, Rite Aid, New York Life, BET, AFLAC, United Bank of 
Philadelphia, BankBoston, Bankers Trust and Sloan Financial Group. 
</P>
<P>
	Arriving here, the corporate chiefs climbed into vans and  
followed Clinton's limousine to the Sweet Auburn Curb Street 
Market, a 76-year-old municipal market in a mostly black 
neighborhood where Martin Luther King Jr. lived. 
</P>
<P>
	They were greeted by produce vendors, bakers and butchers  
offering salted pigs' tails, oxtails and goat meat along with more 
traditional goods. ``You guys see the cows' feet and pig ears back 
there?'' Clinton asked, recalling a time when Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin tried to persuade him to eat a roasted pig's ear. 
</P>
<P>
	Shop owner Sonya Jones got Clinton to try her sweet-potato  
cheesecake. ``This is my cheesecake lady, who destroyed my diet 
today,'' he remarked later, introducing Jones at a roundtable 
discussion. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's visit was intended to highlight his ``new markets  
initiative'' of proposed tax incentives and loan guarantees 
designed to attract venture capital to areas in need of economic 
stimulus. 
</P>
<P>
	``America is very good at creating jobs,'' he said. But he said  
there are problems with ``places that have been down for a long 
time ... and getting that economic opportunity there and bringing 
people into the circle of success.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``And if we can't do it now when the economy's good,'' he said,  
``we'll never get around to doing it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The market, operating since 1923, fell on hard times earlier  
this decade. In 1992, Atlanta city officials began a $4.9 million 
restoration, and today the market boasts 24 businesses, eight of 
which receive direct federal empowerment-zone assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	In turn, businesses within the market have begun hiring nearby  
residents and they receive tax credits for creating those jobs. At 
least $8.3 million in federal money has gone into the market since 
it was refurbished. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, vendors said times are hard.  
</P>
<P>
	``I can't say definitely we're going to survive,'' said Sandy  
Song, 29, whose family has sold produce since 1976. ``Right now 
we're struggling to survive.'' She said business was better when 
there was a food stamp office in the market. 
</P>
<P>
	``Business could be better,'' said flower merchant Dwight  
McCrary.

<HEADLINE> Dole Opposes Concealed Weapons Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elizabeth Dole, distinguishing herself from  
front-runner George W. Bush and the rest of the GOP presidential 
field, said Tuesday that Americans should not be allowed to carry 
concealed weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think police work is hard enough already,'' she said in a  
draft of a speech to a gathering of working women. Mrs. Dole added, 
however, that the issue is ultimately in the hands of state 
legislators. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the remarks moved the former American Red Cross president  
squarely in the political middle on the contentious gun control 
issue, leaving some GOP consultants wondering whether conservative 
primary voters will accept the stance. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is odd. It's certainly attention-getting for the national  
media,'' Republican consultant Michael Hudome said. ``But it 
probably won't work in a Republican primary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Scott Reed, who managed the 1996 presidential campaign  
of Dole's husband, Bob Dole, called it a wise strategy. ``She is 
differentiating herself from the front-runner and attracting a 
coalition back to the GOP -- a coalition made up of women and 
mothers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three weeks after the Colorado high school shooting, Republican  
presidential candidates are staking out territory on guns and 
school violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Other than Bush and Dole, no GOP candidate supports further  
legislation to restrict access to guns. Typical of the rest of the 
field is Gary Bauer, the conservative activist who says the 
shootings are the result of deeper social problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush and Dole already have said they support the federal bans on  
assault weapons and armor-piercing bullets. Mrs. Dole unveiled 
those stances in a New Hampshire gathering of presidential 
hopefuls, drawing a cool reception from activists. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, as Texas governor, signed into law a measure allowing  
state residents to get a license to carry a concealed weapon; it 
requires training and a background check. 
</P>
<P>
	``Governor Bush has a record of doing in office what he says he  
will do on the campaign trail,'' spokeswoman Karen Hughes said, a 
subtle reference to the fact that Mrs. Dole has never held elective 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know many women and men in Texas who have gone through the  
training and who have a license and who feel safer because of that 
legislation -- particularly women who travel or work late at 
night,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole's campaign believes there is growing support for her  
position on guns -- even among GOP voters -- and they are betting 
that she will get credit for taking a tough stand even if their 
polls are wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the right thing to do and I won't shy away from the tough  
issues, even if some in my party don't like it,'' Mrs. Dole said 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``That includes issues like allowing people to carry concealed  
weapons. While that's a matter for the states to decide, I think 
police work is hard enough already. No one should make it harder. I 
think it's wrong to let people carry concealed weapons,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She also announced her support of a mandatory requirement that  
guns be sold with child safety locks. Bush supports a voluntary 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Tuesday in Philadelphia, Mrs. Dole took a jab at the  
entertainment industry. She said TV and movie executives should 
take into account the effect of sex and violence on young minds. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Hollywood folks have got to realize with their First  
Amendment rights come responsibilities in terms of what is 
presented to our children, because kids tend to emulate what they 
see,'' the Republican presidential candidate told reporters after a 
speech to 1,500 people at the 15th annual Philadelphia Leadership 
Prayer Breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's far too much violence and casual sex and all the rest  
today,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Dole was a frequent critic of the entertainment industry  
during the 1996 campaign.

<HEADLINE> Indian Museum Will Open on Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rick West, director of the National Museum of  
the American Indian, said Monday that groundbreaking for its first 
Washington building has been delayed until late summer or early 
fall by a dispute over architect Douglas Cardinal and his design. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that Cardinal was ``an architect that the Smithsonian  
is never going to hire again'' but said the museum would open next 
door to the Air and Space Museum on time late in 2002. Cost is 
estimated at $110 million. Ground was to have been broken early 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Smithsonian Institution runs 15 museums and the National  
Zoo, and is sponsoring the Indian museum too. 
</P>
<P>
	West is a Cheyenne Indian. Cardinal, a Canadian, has Indian  
ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Smithsonian hired a new architectural firm, complaining that  
Cardinal had not presented all the drawings he promised. 
Washington's Fine Arts Commission last month turned down the new 
firm's design changes. Chairman J. Carter Brown denounced as 
``ugly'' a thick column proposed to hold up a bold overhanging 
roof. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're working diligently to come up with changes we can all  
agree on,'' he said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission meets again May 20, but West was not certain that  
a new version of the design would be ready. Although Brown said he 
thought the column could be eliminated, it was still there in a 
projection shown at a Smithsonian news conference Monday.

<HEADLINE> Intel Starts Fund To Promote Chip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Intel Corp. has established a $250  
million investment fund to urge software companies to develop 
Internet applications for its new microprocessor technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel aims to increase the market for its Merced chip when it  
goes into full-scale production, which is expected in mid-2000, The 
Wall Street Journal reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The chip processes data in 64-bit chunks instead of the current  
32 bits. 
</P>
<P>
	John Miner, a vice president for Intel's enterprise server  
group, called the fund ``one ingredient'' to encourage start-up 
companies to invest in 64-bit applications, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fund is expected to target software related to electronic  
commerce, design, financial applications, infrastructure for the 
Internet and planning software for large businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Santa Clara-based Intel is contributing $100 million toward  
the fund. Other investors include Compaq Computer Corp., Dell 
Computer Corp., Silicon Graphics Inc., Hewlett-Packard Co. and NEC 
Corp.

<P>
	Elements of President Clinton's New Markets Initiative:  
</P>
<P>
	--A $1 billion tax credit designed to spur $6 billion in new  
equity capital for investment in targeted markets. The 
administration hopes the 25 percent credit will attract investors, 
who in turn could support small technology companies, inner-city 
shopping centers, manufacturers, retail stores and other 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	--Creation of new private investment partnerships to be known as  
America's Private Investment Companies patterned after the Overseas 
Private Investment Corp. The entity would make equity investments 
in larger businesses that expand or relocate to inner cities or 
rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
	--Targeting of the federal small-business investment program to  
low- and moderate-income areas. This program provides equity and 
debt financing to small companies that are looking to grow. America 
Online and Staples are two examples of companies that have 
benefited from this program, but the White House says it has been 
of little benefit to inner cities and rural areas.

<HEADLINE> Crude Oil Down; Coffee, Cattle Up  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Crude oil futures retreated Tuesday on the New York Mercantile  
Exchange as major oil companies indicated they are cutting back on 
refining operations, moves that could negate the effects of 
producer cutbacks on output. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, coffee and cattle futures jumped.  
</P>
<P>
	Crude fell after Royal Dutch-Shell Group and BP Amoco, the  
world's No. 1 and No. 3 refiners, indicated that weaker profit 
margins caused them to cut back on refining in the three months of 
the year. Slower purchases of crude by refiners could thwart the 
intended effect of the output cuts, which were meant to lift oil 
prices by limiting supply. 
</P>
<P>
	Refiners' profits have weakened because crude prices rose  
sharply in the face of promised output reductions from the 
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, Norway, Mexico and 
others, while prices for refined products such as heating oil have 
not risen as quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	A report released Monday by the International Energy Agency  
examining OPEC's April production showed 85 percent compliance of 
the planned 1.72 million barrels in cuts, but analysts said that 
could be negated if refiners continue to cut back on purchases. 
Many noted the International Energy Agency also had revised 
downward its estimates of the amount of world demand for oil over 
the next few months. 
</P>
<P>
	Market participants also are worried that fluctuations in price  
could cause producers to begin secretly cheating on their promised 
cuts to make as much money as they can at the expense of others. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Petroleum Institute reported after trading had  
ended that crude stockpiles continued to decline, falling 2.3 
million barrels last week. That signals that the producer cuts are 
still holding. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude for June delivery fell 57 cents to $18 a barrel; June  
heating oil fell .77 cent to 43.09 a barrel; June unleaded gasoline 
fell .78 cent to 53.19 cents a gallon; June natural gas fell 6.6 
cents to $2.236 for each 1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee futures rose sharply on the Board of Trade of the City of  
New York, extending a rally from a day earlier, as Brazil headed 
into more dicey winter growing months. 
</P>
<P>
	Futures prices typically become volatile at this time of year  
since Brazil is the world's largest grower and any sustained freeze 
could cause significant crop damage. Some speculators are betting 
Brazil cannot have a third consecutive year of mild temperatures 
that have led to bumper harvests. 
</P>
<P>
	The investment chief for George Soros' Quantum Fund said  
commodity prices, particular those for coffee and cocoa, were 
poised to go higher. 
</P>
<P>
	July arabica coffee rose 2.05 cents to $1.074 a pound.  
</P>
<P>
	Cattle futures rose sharply on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange  
as market participants bet the upcoming Memorial Day holiday will 
spur retail demand. 
</P>
<P>
	With meteorologists predicting above-normal temperatures for the  
next 10 days in some of the larger consumption areas, analysts said 
grilling demand could surge. Beef demand is at its highest between 
Memorial Day and the Fourth of July holidays. 
</P>
<P>
	June live cattle rose .45 cent to 61.40 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle rose 1 cent to 73.17 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Wheat Up, Corn Mixed, Soybeans Down / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Wheat futures rose Tuesday on the Chicago Board  
of Trade, while corn finished mixed. Soybeans moved lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat fell on concerns about variable yields across the winter  
wheat belt. Corn seesawed as investors squared positions in advance 
of the government's new supply and demand estimates due Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans were pressured by the Agriculture Department's crop  
update report released late Monday that showed 12 percent of 
soybeans were planted as of last week, up 1 percent from the 
five-year average. Investors expect planting to accelerate in 
coming weeks as the window for planting corn closes. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery rose 3 cents to $2.67 a bushel; July  
corn rose 1/2 cent to $2.22 1/4 a bushel; July oats fell 1 1/2 cents to 
$1.27 1/4 a bushel; July soybeans fell 1 1/2 cents to $4.77 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef futures rose strongly on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,  
while pork futures fell sharply amid falling cash-market prices 
tied to heavy competition. 
</P>
<P>
	June live cattle rose .45 cent to 61.40 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle rose 1 cent to 73.17 cents a pound; June lean hogs 
fell .73 cent to 59.97 cents a pound; July pork bellies fell 2.12 
cents to 59.05 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Motorola Sells Chip Unit for $1.6B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCHAUMBURG, Ill. (AP) -- A group of investors is buying Motorola  
Corp.'s semiconductor components unit for more than $1.6 billion, 
the company announced today. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale to Texas Pacific Group, based in Fort Worth and San  
Francisco, comes a day after another group that also included 
Motorola executives disclosed it had made a similar offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the proposed transaction, Motorola would receive  
$1.6 billion in cash, notes and approximately 10 percent of the 
stock of the new company. The transaction is expected to be 
completed in the second half of 1999, subject to regulatory and 
other approvals. 
</P>
<P>
	The news helped send Motorola's stock price higher today. In  
afternoon trading, Motorola shares were up $2.81 1/4 or 3.4 percent at 
$84.68 3/4 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The buyer is a private investment partnership with capital of  
approximately $2.5 billion. It's principals include David 
Bonderman, James G. Coulter, and William S. Price. 
</P>
<P>
	The group said it will keep Steve Hanson, Motorola senior vice  
president and general manager of the Semiconductor Components 
Group, in his position as president, while the present management 
team and employees of the unit will become employees of the new 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	``As an independent enterprise, we will focus on the strengths  
that have made us one of the world's largest components 
suppliers,'' Hanson said. ``This will enable us to develop and 
implement a business model fully suited to our mission, while 
continuing a strong tie with Motorola.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement comes after a group of former and present  
Motorola executives disclosed they had made an unsolicited offer 
March 30 for the unit. TFG Acquisition Group said it had recently 
refined it to profess job security for most of the approximately 
10,000 workers at plants in eight countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorola is restructuring its chip-making business to make it  
more profitable after a major downturn in the industry last year 
that came partly as a result of the Asian economic crisis. There 
was some speculation in February that the Schaumburg, Ill., 
equipment maker was shopping the chip components unit around for a 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorola hopes to concentrate on the high-end semiconductor  
business that provides embedded chips, while keeping some interest 
in the components business, said company chief executive 
Christopher Galvin.

	``I have been very encouraged by my physicians' diagnosis and I  
should be well on my way to recovery following my surgery in 
June,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens has canceled his summer season at the Acuff Theatre in  
Nashville. He plans to resume in September with a Christmas show.

	Among his hits are ``Everything is Beautiful'' and ``The  
Streak.''

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Faces Impeachment Hearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- The lower chamber of parliament decided today to  
start impeachment proceedings against President Boris Yeltsin 
despite strong opposition from the prime minister and the Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
	The governing council of the State Duma, the lower chamber,  
agreed to start three days of hearings on Thursday. Yeltsin faces 
five charges and opposition leaders hope to oust him from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov criticized the Duma's decision,  
saying he believes Yeltsin must serve out his term, which ends next 
summer. He said his government would not support the Duma. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin rebuffed an invitation from the Duma to attend the  
hearings and is ``calm,'' said Alexander Kotenkov, the presidential 
envoy to the Duma. The president, confident of victory, does not 
want the impeachment proceedings delayed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the deputies put them off once again, the president will  
take certain measures,'' said Kotenkov, without providing any more 
details. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin is expected to survive even if the Duma votes for  
impeachment. To remove him, the upper chamber of parliament and the 
supreme and constitutional courts must also approve the impeachment 
-- something considered very unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Duma deputies suggested today that proceedings may be  
delayed at the last moment, as they were last month, because the 
opposition is unsure of victory. Delaying the vote also would allow 
the opposition to maintain pressure on Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges against Yeltsin include instigating the 1991 Soviet  
collapse, improperly using force against hard-line lawmakers in 
1993, launching a 1994-96 war in the separatist republic of 
Chechnya, ruining the nation's military and waging genocide against 
the Russian people by pursuing economic policies that impoverished 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chechen count is the only one given a reasonable chance of  
being passed. 
</P>
<P>
	Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, a presidential aspirant, blasted the  
Duma today, saying it would not succeed in removing Yeltsin. He 
said the lawmakers should be tackling Russia's economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that any kind of destabilization of our life isn't  
beneficial for us and is harmful,'' he was quoted as saying by the 
Interfax news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Gennady Zyuganov, who heads the Communist faction in the Duma,  
said the Russian people have already effectively condemned 
Yeltsin's policies, noting that his approval ratings are in the low 
single digits. But opinion polls indicate many Russians oppose 
impeachment, fearing it would destabilize the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin has indicated he may fire Primakov or the entire  
Cabinet. Yeltsin has a history of abruptly firing aides and even 
government ministers and is notorious for his resentment of 
subordinates who appear to overshadow him. 
</P>
<P>
	Some politicians say Yeltsin may even dissolve parliament,  
prompting a major political crisis.

<HEADLINE>  Mourning Gets Help Against Knicks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Alonzo Mourning turned in another strong  
performance against the New York Knicks, and this time he had some 
help. 
</P>
<P>
	Mourning scored 26 points Monday night and anchored the Miami  
Heat's defense, as usual, leading them past the New York Knicks 
83-73 in Game 2 of the best-of-5 series. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the MVP of the league,'' Knicks counterpart Patrick Ewing  
said. ``If he doesn't get it, there's something wrong with you all 
who vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Game 1, a 20-point Heat loss, Mourning was a one-man show.  
But in Game 2, he enjoyed plenty of support from guards Tim 
Hardaway, Dan Majerle and Terry Porter. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway had another poor shooting game, going just 1-for-5 and  
scoring 11 points, but he dished out 11 assists. Majerle made two 
3-pointers, his first baskets of the series, to hold New York at 
bay in the final quarter. And Porter had 11 points and six rebounds 
off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those guys stepped up and made a difference in the game,''  
Mourning said. ``They made plays for everybody. It's about 
penetrating and knocking shots down, and those three are the 
MVPs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, when Mourning had 27 points, the rest of the Heat's  
starting lineup shot 24 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The other night, there was only one guy that showed up for  
us,'' forward P.J. Brown said. ``That was Zo, and everybody knows 
it. There was no way we could win this playoff series if only one 
guy is showing up to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the Heat also know they need Mourning to lead the way, which  
he did Monday by making 10 of 16 shots, grabbing eight rebounds and 
blocking four shots in 46 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was very active,'' Heat coach Pat Riley said. ``He played  
great the other night, and he played great tonight. He's so 
physical, and he's so needed by us out there. 
</P>
<P>
	``His presence in the middle can change a lot of things.  
Anything that was coming to the basket, he was changing. He 
definitely gave us the game we needed to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing had 16 points and 15 rebounds but struggled to stop  
Mourning. The former Georgetown alums were matched up more 
frequently than in Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``Patrick and I have had some battles,'' Mourning said. ``But  
it's a 5-on-5 competition. It's not a boxing match.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And in 5-on-5, the Heat had the edge Monday.
