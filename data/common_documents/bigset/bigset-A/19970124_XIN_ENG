<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's First Prime
Minister Norodom Ranariddh today confirmed he involved in
creating a new party alliance to contest in this year's local
elections and next year's general elections.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh, president of the Funcinpec Party, said he is
ready to set up the National United Front "which would be open to
all."
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the closing ceremony of a seminar
at the law faculty, he said, "It is not an alliance against this
or that," and even his party's chief rival, the Cambodian People's
Party, (CPP) would be allowed to join.
</P>
<P>
"All really patriotic Cambodians should join," he said,
promising that every member party of the Front will retain its
own "identity and autonomy."
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh, who made the announcement on the eve of a CPP
congress, said a charter for the front has been worked
out and approved by the Funcinpec Party, the Khmer National Party
(KNP) led by former Finance Minister Sam Rainsy, and the
Democratic National Union Movement under the leadership of Ieng
Sary, who broke away from the Khmer Rouge last August.
</P>
<P>
A faction of the Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party led by its
founder Son Sann, and the Khmer Neutral Party, are studying the
charter, but are expected to join, the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh said that he would personally present the charter to
Chea Sim, CPP president and president of the National Assembly, to
see "if the CPP is able to join the front."
</P>
<P>
KNP president Sam Rainsy said in a press statement today that
"the Khmer National Party confirms that it is prepared to join the
National United Front."

<HEADLINE> China's Housing Reform Goals Set For 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, January 23 (Xinhua) -- State Councillor Li Tieying
said today that China will encourage housing growth and increased
investment in state housing projects this year so as to set up a
new housing system compatible with the socialist market economy by
the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Li, who is a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist
Party of China's Central Committee and head of the State Council's
Housing Reform Leading Group, made the remarks at a national
conference on housing reforms in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan
Province.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, China had 39.3 billion yuan (about 4.7
billion US dollars) in housing funds and rent per square-metre of
space had grown to between 0.8 and 1.5 yuan.
</P>
<P>
In some cities, authorities lowered housing prices to near
construction costs, and the Comfortable Housing Project, a
state-funded project to provide affordable housing for people with
inadequate living space, went smoothly.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 and the first half of 1996, the project got 28.79
billion yuan in state funds, and 23.77 million sq.m. in housing,
were completed, 19.16 million of which sold.
</P>
<P>
Li told the conference that the housing system reforms in 1997
should try to make progress in a stable and appropriate way, and
that the old system of distributing houses as a kind of welfare
should be gradually abolished in a planned way.
</P>
<P>
He pointed to the importance of improving the collection, use,
management, and supervision of the housing fund, and said that
primary task in housing reforms in 1997 and afterwards is ensuring
the safety and proper use of the fund.
</P>
<P>
He also revealed that this year the central government has
plans to increase its loans to the Comfortable Housing Project by
10 billion yuan, most of which will go to cities with a good
record of housing reforms and in carrying out the project.

<HEADLINE> Egypt: No Foreign Help in Probes on Letter Bombs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has not and will not
request any foreign assistance in the investigations into letter
bombs found in the United States, Egyptian Minister of Interior
Hassan Mohamed al-Alfy said today.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks during a visit to Egypt's Police
Academy here, rejecting a report that foreign security experts
were sought for help.
</P>
<P>
Al-Alfy said the cooperation in this case is no more than an
exchange of information with the United States.
</P>
<P>
Nine letter bombs bearing postal marks from the Mediterranean
Sea resort of Alexandria, north of Egypt, were sent to offices of
the Arabic-language Al-Hayat newspaper in Washington and New York
and other places of the United States early this month.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has categorically denied any letter bombs went out of
Alexandria, suggesting that the stamps were fake.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is conducting the investigations on its own, the
interior minister said, adding that the exchange of information
and the receipt of the original copies of the letter bombs are
necessary. It has also asked the U.S. to track the course of the
letter bombs inside the United States.

<HEADLINE> US Weekly Jobless Claims Hit A 10-month High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The number of new claims for
jobless benefits shot up by 34,000 in the U.S. last week, the
biggest jump in 10 months, the Labor Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that new applications for unemployment
insurance totaled a seasonally adjusted 355,000, up from 321,000
during the week ended January 11.
</P>
<P>
The increase was the steepest since new claims rose by 47,000
during the week ended on March 23 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Many analysts attributed the increase in part to volatility
often associated with end-of-year problems in adjustments for
seasonal variations.
</P>
<P>
The four-week moving average of new weekly jobless claims in
the country rose by 2,750 to 353,750, highest since 358,250 during
the period ended January 4, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The four-week average is closely watched since it smooths out
the spikes in the volatile weekly reports.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. economy is growing moderately which should result in
tighter job markets and fewer jobless claims. The U.S. government
reported earlier this month that 262,000 new jobs were created in
December, the most in seven months.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Federal Reserve survey announced on Wednesday also
disclosed numerous instances of labor shortages, particularly
among skilled workers.

<HEADLINE> France to Build 2 Conventionally Powered Submarines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 23 (Xinhua) -- France will build for Chile two
"Scorpion Fish" class conventionally powered submarines at a
value of 2.5 billion francs (500 million U.S. dollars), announced
the French military today.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Yves Helmer, General Delegate of Armament of the French
Army, was quoted as saying that France has been chosen by the
Chilean government to negotiate a contract on building the two
1,400-ton new design submarines for the Chilean Navy.
</P>
<P>
"The Chilean authorities have expressed their preference to a
proposal by the DCN (state navy industrial company of France). We
have good hope of concluding the contract in the coming months,"
said Helmer.
</P>
<P>
The German company HDW, Swedish Kockums and some British firms
were beat by the DCN in the bidding for the contract, according to
the Agence France-Presse (AFP).
</P>
<P>
The DCN International, the affiliate of the DCN in charge of
exporting warships, proposed to Chile that it would use some
newest technologies for nuclear-powered submarines in designing
the two combat vessels, particularly the technology for
maintaining silence of their movement.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish naval company Empresa Nacional Bazan also will win
a sub-contract in the deal, which will be realized in a French
naval dockyard.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Journalists Urged to Improve Ethics (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- A nationwide TV and telephone
conference today discussed Chinese journalists' professionalism
and ethics and avoiding "paid news".
</P>
<P>
The conference was jointly sponsored by the Propaganda
Department of the Communist Party of China's Central Committee,
the Ministry of Radio, Film, and Television, the Press and
Publication Administration of China, and the All-China
Journalists' Association.
</P>
<P>
Participants said that, since the sixth plenum of the 14th CPC
Central Committee last October, ethical and cultural progress in
China has been advanced. They agreed that, as the publicizers and
promoter of a nationwide campaign, journalists should be models of
socialist ethical and cultural progress, instead of mere
supervisors.
</P>
<P>
Recently, ten major service sectors, including the railways,
public security, and posts and telecommunications, took the lead
in announcing criteria for "civilized services", and launched a
campaign of "serving the people and improving professional ethics".
</P>
<P>
Zheng Mengxiong, executive vice-president of the All-China
Journalists' Association, said that there is now a revised version
of the "Code of Professional Ethics for Chinese Journalists", and
Liang Heng, deputy director of the Press and Publication
Administration, read the full text of "Regulations On
Forbidding 'Paid News'", agreed upon by the four sponsoring
organizations.
</P>
<P>
"Generally Speaking, China's press corps are good, and the
majority of the journalists are strict with themselves, do a clean
job, and get favorable comments from the general public," the
participants noted.
</P>
<P>
However, they conceded that with the new conditions of setting
up a socialist market economy, some new problems have arisen and
some members of the press are still turning out "paid news"
regardless of the ban.

<P>
"Even though the problem of 'paid news' only involved a small
number of people, it has done great harm by corrupting
journalists, tarnishing their reputation, and affecting the nature
of socialist journalism," they noted.
</P>
<P>
They went on to say that "paid news", which is against
journalistic principles, professional ethics, the Party
leadership, and the ideology of serving the people has had a very
bad effect on society, and has been strongly opposed by both the
general public and by most journalists.
</P>
<P>
Journalists across China were urged to carefully study a speech
by President Jiang Zemin during a visit to the country's leading
newspaper, People's Daily, where he called on journalists to
"strictly follow professional ethics and firmly oppose 'paid
news'", putting an end to the practice.
</P>
<P>
"Journalists must try to create a sound public image for
themselves by means of self-discipline and by putting themselves
under the supervision of the whole society," said the participants.
</P>
<P>
Journalists across the country were also asked to closely study
the two documents from today's conference and to try to establish
an effective system that awards those who comply and censures
those who do not.
</P>
<P>
"Journalists should correctly handle the relation between
social benefit and financial profit, news coverage and the market
economy, self-discipline and supervision by others, and
ideological education and disciplinary punishment," they said,
adding that the elimination of "paid news" should be regarded as a
key part of one's political awareness and readiness to serve the
people whole-heartedly.
</P>
<P>
Xu Guangchun, deputy head of the Propaganda Department of the
CPC Central Committee, said that 41 news units across the country
have been chosen as "demonstration units of ethical and cultural
progress", whose improvement in enhancing professional ethics and
boycotting "paid news" will be open to public scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 journalists attended today's conference, which
was participated in by 30 different sites across the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, January 23 (Xinhua) -- A group of ranking officials
have gone to the earthquake-hit area in northwest China to
organize rescue and disaster-relief work.
</P>
<P>
An earthquake measuring 6.4 on the Richter Scale rocked Jiashi
County in Kashgar, in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region on
January 21, killing 12 people, injuring 36, and causing a great
deal of property damage.
</P>

Hundreds of tents have reportedly been set up, and more than
1,000 soldiers of the People's Liberation Army are making an
effort to conduct rescue work, and to keep people calm.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that some 50 trucks of coal are on their way to
the area to help local people deal with the cold.
</P>
<P>
The Kashgar branch of the China People's Insurance Company has
paid in advance one million yuan to the seriously-damaged county
in compensation.

<HEADLINE> Greek Seamen End Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Greek seamen and dock workers
today ended a 10-day strike after intensive all-night negotiations
between the government and the Panhellenic Seamen's Federation
(PNO).
</P>
<P>
The stoppage, which paralyzed transport and caused hardships to
the Greek islands, involved all ships with Greek crews and kept
vessels moored at port stranding thousands of angry passengers and
hundreds of local and foreign lorries in Greek and Italian ports.
</P>
<P>
A federation spokesman said their union has accepted "improved
government proposals submitted to them by a committee headed by
Merchant Marine Minister Stavros Soumakis".
</P>
<P>
The seamen's main demands was preservation of a special tax
status for them since 1955 which the government changed in its tax
legislation.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman warned that "if satisfactory solutions will not
be given there will be a new round of strikes."
</P>
<P>
The government's new proposals include the starting of a
dialogue between the employers, the seamen and the state for the
settlement of employment issues on ocean-going vessels, the
seamen's registry, preservation of pensions at 58 percent of their
basic wages and the taxation of officers' salaries with 8 percent
this year, 9 percent from 1998 and on, and 4 and 6 percent
respectively for lower-ranking crews.

<HEADLINE> EC Backtracks on EU Expansion Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
today backtracked on its earlier prediction on the timing of
expansion of the European Union by saying that no date for EU
enlargement could be forecast beyond the start of negotiations,
scheduled for early 1998.
</P>
<P>
This statement came after the Commission released a fact sheet
in which it predicted that no new country was likely to join the
15-member bloc before the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
It called the release of the statement "erroneous" and
"regrettable."
</P>
<P>
"The European Commission hopes that the first accession can be
realized as soon as possible," it said in the statement, pointing
out that this position, shared by Commission President Jacques
Santer and other members of the Commission, remained "unchanged"
at present.
</P>
<P>
It reiterated that the eventual date of accession depends on
the following factors: the state of preparation of the candidate
countries as well as of the EU itself, especially in the context
of the Inter-Governmental Conference currently underway to decide
on reforms to and the future shape of the EU, the duration of
accession talks as well as ratification procedures.
</P>
<P>
In a 30-point fact sheet on the EU's enlargement process
released on Wednesday, the Commission said: "Taking into account
the possible duration of negotiations and time needed for
ratification, the earliest realistic date for the first accessions
is likely to be no earlier than 2002."
</P>
<P>
This prediction has sparked concern across Eastern Europe,
especially in Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary, who are seen
as the most likely to be the first applicant countries to obtain
EU membership.

<HEADLINE> Tung Says PC Legal Panel Recommendation Is Right </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Tung Chee Hwa said
today that the latest recommendation of the Preparatory
Committee's Legal sub-group on the amendments to some Hong Kong
laws is right.
</P>
<P>
Tung delivered a speech this evening when accepting the Award
of "1996 Leader of the Year".
</P>
<P>
Tung said that the Preparatory Committee's Legal sub-group
recently recommended certain laws either in part or in total to
cease to be in force after July 1 this year, which is a follow-up
of the work of the Preliminary Working Committee.
</P>
<P>
"These are not new issues," he said. The latest recommendation
is "a follow-up of the work of the Preliminary Working Committee"
and "is in fact more open."
</P>
<P>
He said the Preliminary Working Committee and the Preparatory
Committee's Legal Sub-group actually looked at 624 laws and more
than a thousand sub-laws. Ultimately, the Legal sub-group decided
to recommend to the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress that 15 laws in their entirety and 11 laws in part shall
cease to be in force because they are inconsistent with the Basic
Law.
</P>
<P>
Most of these changes are recommended because of the colonial
aspect of the laws which shall cease to apply after July 1, 1997.
Three of them are electoral laws which for reasons well known to
everyone shall cease to be in force. There are three changes that
deal with the Bill of Rights, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said some people in Hong Kong have alleged that there are
wholesale changes of Hong Kong laws proposed by the Preparatory
Committee Legal sub-group. But in fact, the changes are minimal,
so these allegations are far from being the truth, Tung pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
"With regards to the Bill of Rights, let me further state,
there is no need for anxiety because Hong Kong people's freedom
and rights are guaranteed by Chapter 3 of the Basic Law," Tung
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the amendments to the Bill of Rights are legalistic and
technical in nature and is not controversial.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the recommendation that the Public Order
Ordinance and the Societies Ordinance should cease to be in force,
Tung said it is important to get the right balance between
individual rights and social order for the good of the entire
community.
</P>
<P>
"The issue is not about the freedom of expression and freedom
of assembly. The issue is not about human rights," he said. "The
issue here is really getting it right between balancing individual
rights and the good of the public at large."
</P>
<P>
"My personal view on the Societies Ordinance is also similar to
that of the Legal sub-group," he said. "I believe the Preparatory
Committee Legal sub-group's recommendation is right because I do
not believe the community wants undue foreign political influences
in Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
He said it is understandable that these issues have created
feelings of concern in some areas of the community.
</P>
<P>
"I know many skeptics will not be turned into believers by my
words. To those people, I urge you to have faith. To these
non-believers, I also invite you to come and look for yourselves
after July 1, 1997 to see how strong, how vibrant, how cohesive
and how free we are as a society," he said.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Ban Mammal Additives in Cattle Feed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Canada is expected to enact
regulations soon to ban the use of mammal additives in cattle feed
in a bid to reduce mad-cow disease risk.
</P>
<P>
At present, additives, namely ground-up bits of other cows,
sheep or any other mammal, can make up 20 percent or more of
cattle feed in Canada.
</P>
<P>
The ban is in response to the human health risks associated
with eating meat from cows infected with bovine spongiform
encephalopathy or BSE, a fatal brain condition commonly known as
mad-cow disease, according to today's Globe and Mail newspaper.
</P>
<P>
A decade of research in Britain has linked cattle feed
containing ground bone and body parts from sheep with the
appearance of brain-wasting BSE in cows in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
British scientists announced last year that they had strong
evidence of a long-suspected link between BSE and some cases of
its human counterpart, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
</P>
<P>
Since last April, Canada has been considering a ban on the
animal-feed additives. The ban could come into effect as early as
April 1 of this year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The most likely substitute for meat products in cattle feed
would be soya, although fish and poultry could theoretically be
used.
</P>
<P>
The cost of transformation to a vegetarian diet for naturally
vegetarian animals might cost Canada as high as 22 million U.S.
dollars, according to an official at the Agriculture and Agrifood
Canada.

<HEADLINE> EU Real Agricultural Prices 1.2 Percent Down in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Real agricultural producer
prices in the European Union(EU) are expected to be 1.2 percent
down in 1996 compared with 1995, according to a report today from
the EU's statistical office Eurostat.
</P>
<P>
Eurostat commented that steep price falls for calves and cattle
were thought to reflect consumer fears of mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
Today's forecast followed rises of 0.3 percent in both 1995 and
1994. Real prices fell steeply from 1989 to 1993, then stabilized.
These latest data showed a cumulative decline of 16.1 since 1990.
</P>
<P>
Last year only Italy(1.6 percent) and the Netherlands(0.2
percent) registered increases.
</P>
<P>
Biggest decrease was Finland's steep 15.0 percent, partly due
to phasing out national price subsidies.
</P>
<P>
Other notable falls were returned by Luxembourg(7.2 percent),
Ireland(5.3 percent), Sweden(5.0 percent) and Britain(4.2
percent).
</P>
<P>
Real prices for crop products are expected to be 1.1 percent
down following the rise of 4.8 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Real prices for animals and animal products fell by 1.3
percent, less than the 3.8 percent decline in 1995.

<HEADLINE> New Method Invented in Greece for Cleaning Oil Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 23 (Xinhua) -- A Greek research professor today
presented a new method for cleaning up oil pollution in the sea
which uses magnetism to separate the oil from sea water.
</P>
<P>
"Clean Mag" is a special compound of plastic materials
containing magnetized particles.
</P>
<P>
Professor George Nicolaides said the compound had the property
of being able to selectively absorb petroleum products and oils
without absorbing water.
</P>
<P>
"This means that when the petroleum products come into contact
with the compound, they quickly stick to Clean Mag and remain on
the surface of the sea where they can easily be collected with the
use of electromagnets," Nicolaides said.
</P>
<P>
According to the professor, present methods of cleaning up oil
slicks are extremely costly and are never completely efficient.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, he stressed, Clean Mag has a 100 percent pollution
retrieval rate, is low cost and can be recycled.
</P>
<P>
Nicolaides said that when Clean Mag went into mass production,
he expected great interest on the part of shipping companies and
foreign countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission(EC)
announced today it had approved a package of humanitarian aid
worth ECU 1.5 million (about 1.8 million US dollars) for victims
of conflict in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
It said the aid, channelled by the Euroepan Community
Humanitarian Office(ECHO), would enable non-governmental
organisations to carry out a six-month program of actions focusing
on health and de-mining, mainly in the north of the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the EC, inhabitants in the north of Cambodia have
been left isolated and deprived of practically all access to
primary health care as a result of long-running conflict in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The Commission said separate ECHO funding for other projects in
Cambodia so far this year amounted to ECU 560,000(about 672,000

<HEADLINE> Notebook: New Bangkok Airport: To Be or Not To Be </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh seemed to have stirred up a nest of hornets when he
proposed that the second Bangkok international airport be shelved
because of its high cost.
</P>
<P>
Nearly all newspapers in the country today gave front-page or
multi-page prominence to the controversial postponement,
presenting the pros and cons of the proposal.
</P>
<P>
 AN APPLE OF DISCORD
</P>
<P>
In fact, at Tuesday's cabinet meeting no decision was made on
the fate of the new airport at Nong Ngu Hao. Ministers, except
those from the Social Action Party, simply went along with the
prime minister when he made the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit, in keeping his election campaign promise to revive
the economy, said the existing Bangkok Don Muang international
airport could be expanded to cope with the increasing passenger
volume over the next 10 years by requesting the air force, which
has a base adjacent to the civil airport, to provide space for the
expansion.
</P>
<P>
According to the prime minister, the expansion is expected to
cost only 10 billion baht (400 million US dollars), while the
first phase alone of the Nong Ngu Hao airport would cost nearly
100 billion baht (four billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Chavalit indicated at the meeting that he wanted the
37-year-old project delayed for at least 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Nong Ngu Hao, which means the Cobra Swamp, is low-lying and
flood-prone, and needs land refill with sand and construction of a
six-km-long flood prevention wall.
</P>
<P>
 ACCUSATION
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Montri Pongpanich, leader of the Social
Action Party, is among those who are most strongly against the
postponement of the new airport project.
</P>
<P>
In the division of work of the six-party coalition government,
his party is in charge of the project, with Somsak Thepsuthin, a
deputy transport and communications minister, overseeing the
construction. Recently Somsak approved a landfill contract worth
10 billion baht (400 million dollars), which Deputy Prime Minister
Amnuay Virawan considered too high.
</P>
<P>
Unhappy with the shelving, Montri claimed that a certain
neighboring country has bribed a senior Thai politician to
sabotage the new airport. He did not produce evidence or specify
names to substantiate his claim.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the new airport, when completed, could
rival major international airports in the region, such as
Singapore's Changi.
</P>
<P>
Judging from the vengeance with which Montri has come back, the
prime minister's proposal could well become an apple of discord
leading to inter-party conflict in the coalition government.
</P>
<P>
AMNUAY WANTS MORE
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the air force does not seem to be willing to
offer
all the help the prime minister wants.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Amnuay, a staunch supporter for
Chavalit's idea,
said that it would be the best if the air force headquarters would
move
out and give up nearly all of its 385 hectares of land for the
expansion
of the existing airport.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the request, Air Force Commander-in-Chief Amorn
Naewmalee said on Wednesday that the air force is ready to
relocate only
some of its units and make only 100 hectares of land available for
the
civil airport expansion project, falling far short of Amnuay's
expectations.
</P>
<P>
 TO ABORT OR TO KEEP, WHICH IS MORE COSTLY
</P>
<P>
The government's proposed shelving of the Nong Ngu Hao airport
project
may have an impact on 42 companies and one education institute
which have
been contracted to study the design and other work including site
improvements.
</P>
<P>
The total value of these signed contracts is 13.33 billion baht
(533.2
million dollars).
</P>
<P>
At least seven billion baht (280 million dollars) has been paid
during the past few decades since the project was conceived 37
years ago. The payout includes 1.44 billion baht (57.6 million
dollars) in compensation for relocation of villagers.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the flood wall has begun and temporary roads
inside
the site are also being built.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that dusting up the project after 10 years would
cause
the overall cost to skyrocket.
</P>
<P>
Among factors leading to much higher cost are more expensive
labor,
materials and design. Besides, those farmers who have left the
site after
receiving compensation will return to resume their fish-farming.
</P>
<P>
Lost opportunity of the new airport is even more incalculable.
</P>
<P>
The cost of winding up Nong Ngu Hao will be high. it could be
almost
as high as going ahead and building the airport, a local newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
In the weeks to come, the government will have a hard time
making a
decision on the project.

<HEADLINE> Telecoms Liberalization Positive Impact on Employment: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Up to 1.3 million jobs might
be created or maintained by 2005 in the European Union(EU) in a
scenario of rapid liberalization of the telecommunications sector,
according to a recent study of the European Commission.
</P>
<P>
While traditional telecom operators could stand to lose up to
286,000 jobs, the study indicated that this would be compensated
by job creation in the telecom sector as a whole.
</P>
<P>
It said new operators could lead to a net creation or
maintenance of up to 93,000 jobs for the whole sector.
</P>
<P>
This independent study, carried out by French consultants BIPE
Conseil on behalf of the European Commission, is one of many
elements feeding into the debate on the social and employment
aspects of information society launched by the Commission.
</P>
<P>
However, EU Social Affairs Commissioner Padraig Flynn did not
show much optimism, commenting on the study that "forecasts provide
some indications as to future developments, but by their very
nature are uncertain."
</P>
<P>
With a few exceptions, 1 January 1998 is the deadline for full
liberalization of EU's telecommunications market.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Studies More Cuts in Nuclear Warheads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The United States is
studying the possibility of a new agreement with Russia on further
cuts in strategic nuclear weapons based on the 1993 accord which
sets to reduce some 50 percent of such weapons, U.S. senior
officials revealed.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Defense Department is secretly studying the military
consequences of an additional cut of 1, 000 to 1,500 nuclear
warheads to leave residual forces of as few as 2,000 weapons, a
Washington Post report said today.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials see that a proposal for new cuts as a way to
persuade Russian legislators to ratify the so-called START II
treaty, which calls for the 50 percent cuts in nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
The START II was signed in January 1993 by Yeltsin and
President George Bush, was approved by the U.S. Congress a year
ago, but the Russian parliament has yet voted on it as many
Russian legislators were upset by the NATO's plan to expand
eastern-word to include some of the former Warsaw Pact member
nations.
</P>
<P>
Moscow has also been balking at the accord on grounds that it
will cost too much to implement and will impel the Russian
government to build additional strategic weapons to maintain rough
parity with the United States at the ceiling the treaty sets.
</P>
<P>
The study is being conducted by the Joint Chiefs of staff and
by civilian experts at the Pentagon as a part of a broader review
of military strategy and budgets, the Post said. It is also a
preparation for the scheduled summit meeting between U.S.
President Bill Clinton and his Russian counterpart Boris Yeltsin
in March.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin has said that he would support setting a lower ceiling
for strategic nuclear weapons of the two countries than the one
set by START II.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials also suggest Clinton to reach a tentative accord
on the framework of a new treaty during the summit, the newspaper
said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Diamond Prices Plummet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Auridiam Zimbabwe, a diamond
mining firm, said here today diamond prices plunged by nearly 40
percent following a decision by some major producing countries to
sever links with the mineral's international marketing agency.
</P>
<P>
Kevin Dabinett, general manager of the company, said the major
producing countries such as Russia and Australia are no longer
willing to sell their diamond through the Central Selling
Organisation (CSO), which exerted downward pressure on the
mineral's price in the international market.
</P>
<P>
He noted that such moves by the key producers had negatively
affected smaller producers like Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
"This has forced diamond prices down and in fact current
prices are 40 percent lower than when we first started," said the
general manager.
</P>
<P>
The agreement between Russia and the CSO expired a few years
ago and the Russians have not expressed willingness to renew the
agreement while Argyle, the largest Australian Producer, has also
refuse to sell to the organisation.
</P>
<P>
Russia, Australia, South Africa and Botswana are among the top
diamond producing countries while Zimbabwe contributes only a
negligible amount to total world production.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Dabinett said the company anticipated that diamond
production at its River Banch Mine near Beitbridge of South
Zimbabwe would increase by over six percent to 500,000 carats
this year, following last year's 470,000 carats.

ATHENS, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis today had a one-hour meeting with U.S. ambassador to

the entire spectrum of Greek-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that Greek-Turkish relations and the Cyprus
problem had also been discussed in the light of recent
developments.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Greece's Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos today
called on the United States to commit itself to guaranteeing the
implementation of an agreement to ban military flights over the
divided island of Cyprus "whatever may happen".
</P>
<P>
Pangalos was commenting on recent statements by U.S. State
Department spokesman Nicholas Burns that Cyprus was in no need of
Russian made S-300 missiles if there was a moratorium on military
overflights over Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The Americans first put forward the proposal to ban military
flights over Cyprus by Greek and Turkish aircraft in July 1996 and
revived it recently after Cyprus decided to buy anti-aircraft
missiles.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos said Greece had laid out very specific proposals both
on the demilitarization of Cyprus and the creation of good
neighbourly relations with Turkey. "We have done our duty. It's
time for Turkey to do its", the Minister added.
</P>

He also said Greece was ready to contribute to any development
which will defuse tension in the Aegean, clarifying however that

rights.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The Irish government unveiled
the country's 1997-1998 budget on Wednesday, mixing tax cuts with
modest public spending rises, while keeping on track to qualify
for membership of the European Monetary Union.
</P>
<P>
Irish Finance Minister Ruairi Quinn said that current public
expenditure was expected to increase by 6 percent over last year's
13.4 billion Irish pounds (about 21 billion U.S. dollars), according
to press reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
Standard rate of income tax is cut by one percentage point to
26 percent, while personal allowances have been raised by 250
Irish pounds (about 400 dollars) for a single person, and by 500
Irish pounds (about 800 dollars) to married couples.
</P>
<P>
The Irish government is also planning to commit 525 million
Irish pounds (about 840 million dollars) over the next three years
to boost weekly welfare payments, child benefit and family income
supplement.
</P>
<P>
Quinn stressed that the aim of the government was to "reward
work, promote enterprise and strengthen social security".
</P>
<P>
"For the first time in our modern history we are seeing a
sustained net increase in jobs, net emigration was stopped and
some people are coming home," he said.

<P>
ABU DHABI, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Qatar, one of the major oil
exporters in the world, has planned to increase its crude and
condensate output by 58.2 percent by the year 2000, said reports
reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Qatar, a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC), plans to produce 710,000 barrels per day (bpd)
of crude and around 200,000 bpd of condensates by 2000, the
reports quoted official sources of the Qatari Ministry of Energy
and Industry as saying in the Qatari capital of Doha Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Qatar now produces over 500,000 bpd of oil and around 75,000
bpd of condensates.
</P>
<P>
The increase would come from new oil fields, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, Qatar has put two new fields on stream
and rejuvenated an aging field under production sharing
agreements with foreign firms.

<HEADLINE> Ireland to Decide on Participation of Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The Irish government is expected
to make a final decision on whether to participate in the NATO-led
peacekeeping force in former Yugoslavia over the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Irish armed forces are making contingency plans to send
troops to Bosnia in an effort to help implement the Bosnia peace
agreement, the Irish Times newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Irish defense sources have indicated that a small contingent of
company (from 80 to 120 troops) was the most they could contribute
to the Stability Force.
</P>
<P>
This could consist of a transport company to distribute
supplies among the 30,000-strong NATO-led force or a specialist
company of engineers or demining experts, they said.
</P>
<P>
The smallest contribution would be a platoon-sized contingent
of around 30 military policemen for security duties, they added.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Irish Foreign Affairs Department was quoted
as saying on Wednesday that the matter was being looked at and
would be dealt with "without too much delay."
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that Ireland made a considerable
contribution to the peace-keeping operations last year when the
Irish government held the six-month European Union (EU)
presidency.

LUANDA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Angola's Minister of
Communications Licinio Tavares said here today that his
government will implement a concrete plan to modernize and
develop the country's telecommunications facilities.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a seminar on "Africa One" Plan

development and modernization of the telecommunications sector,
though there exist various unfavorable conditions, Tavares noted.
</P>
<P>
The "Africa One" Plan, initiated by the International
Telecommunications Union in 1993, aims to set up a

The minister said that the implementation of the plan will
improve Angola's communication situation and reduce the

<HEADLINE> SADC Parliamentarians Urged to Develop Common </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(By Pei Shanqin)
</P>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The Southern Africa
Development Community (SADC) parliamentarians were urged today to
develop and nurture a common vision and a common regional
perspective on a larger and wider regional context.
</P>
<P>
Opening a two-day interim plenary assembly of the SADC
parliamentary forum here today, President Benjamin Mkapa said
that the SADC will be in a position to make southern Africa a
significant player in the emerging globalizing investment and
trade regime.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said the investment and trade in SADC countries should
accrue to all SADC member countries on the basis of balance,
equity and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
"Our region is blessed with enormous natural resources, if
used properly, they can make our countries rich," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president added, "with vision, determination, courage and
political will we can make a change in the lives of our people
and be a force in our own right in the liberalized global village
of the next century."
</P>
<P>
He said the agreement on the establishment of the forum is an
expression of the firm commitment to democracy, transparency,
good governance and the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
However, the president said that the forum will speed up the
development of a new political culture in the region which will
be a beacon of light, an inspiration, to the rest of the
continent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Tanzanian president said that unity should be
the cornerstone for the integration of the SADC if past mistakes made
elsewhere in Africa are to be avoided.
</P>
<P>
The SADC parliamentary forum, attended by about 50 delegates
from its 12 member states, is expected to adopt its constitution
and elect office bearers.
</P>
<P>
The SADC groups Tanzania, Zambia, Malawi, Mozambique,
Zimbabwe, Botswana, Angola, Namibia, South Africa, Lesotho,
Swaziland and Mauritius.

<HEADLINE> EMU "Very Unlikely" to Start on Time, Major </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 23 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John
Major told parliament today the cabinet concluded that it was
"very unlikely" Britain would join a single currency in January
1999.
</P>
<P>
"It is very unlikely, though not impossible, that the single
currency itself could proceed safely on January 1, 1999," Major
told Commons. "But if it did proceed without reliable convergence
we would not, of course, be part of it."
</P>
<P>
His statement came after a 90-minute cabinet meeting to discuss
Britain's approach to European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU),
the main part of which is the single currency.
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Clarke, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, told reporters
as he left Downing Street: "It is unlikely in my opinion we would
start EMU on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
"We were proceeding on the basis of the policy that we're going
to negotiate and decide at the right time, and that was accepted
by everybody."
</P>
<P>
Foreign Secretary Malcolm Refkind also said: "The crucial
requirement is always the national interest."
</P>
<P>
Major's cabinet is split between ministers who want to rule out
entry into a single currency during the next parliament and those
who want to stick to the policy of keeping Britain's options open.
</P>
<P>
Refkind made it clear earlier he believed neither the national
nor his party's interests would be served by ditching the currency
opt-out Major negotiated in 1991.
</P>
<P>
European Commissioner Leon Brittan who is a strong supporter of
EMU said today the benefits of a single currency would become
clear "when we remove our Eurosceptic blinkers".
</P>
<P>
He also warned the Government against any shift from its "wait
and see" policy on EMU. The warn came after Prime Minister Major
revealed the cabinet considered a 1999 entry into the currency as
"very unlikely".

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King Arrives in Saudi Arabia for Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Hussein
arrived in the Saudi city of Madina today on a visit to the
kingdom to hold talks with King Fahd Bin Abdul Aziz and to pay
pilgrimage, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait News Agency (KUNA) quoted Hussein as saying upon his
arrival that his visit aimed to boost cooperation in security and
open the Saudi market for Jordanian goods, as well as allow job
opportunities for the Jordanian citizens in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian monarch is expected to brief Fahd on the latest
development in the Middle East peace process and the Hebron deal
which allows the Palestinians to control 80 percent of the West
Bank town.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinian National Authority reached the
Hebron deal on January 15, following a few months of hard
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi cabinet in its session last Monday voiced welcome to
the deal and considered it a step towards achieving a lasting
peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
KUNA quoted Jordanian sources as saying that the two kings will
also discuss ways of fostering bilateral relations, especially in
the economic and trade fields.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's ties with its largest southern neighbor and other
Gulf Arab states were strained when Hussein refused to join the
Arab states and Western countries in condemning Iraqi for its
August 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Saudi oil supplies to Jordan were cut off then and Amman was
forced to rely solely on Iraq for its energy needs.
</P>
<P>
Things began to improve when Hussein turned against Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein after the defection of two senior Iraqi
officers to Jordan in 1994 and relations between the two countries
improved dramatically after Hussein's last visit to Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Hussein first visited Saudi Arabia in February, 1994, the first
of its kind since the Gulf War in 1991, but he was not met by Fahd
then. Hussein visited the Saudi coastal city of Jeddah last
August and held his first meeting with King Fahd.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Consumer Prices Rise Modestly in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Canadian consumers faced a 2.2
percent rise in the price of goods and services between December
1995 and December 1996.
</P>
<P>
Statistics Canada said today that advances in transportation
charges contribute to a large part of this annual Consumer Price
Index (CPI) increase.
</P>
<P>
Food prices, university tuition fees, telephone charges and
fuel oil prices also climbed in December 1996.
</P>
<P>
December's inflation rate was higher than that of November and
October, which was 2 percent and 1.8 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The acceleration in inflation since September was due mainly to
increases in the rates for auto insurance, gasoline, air fares and
food, Statistics Canada said.
</P>
<P>
Between 1995 and 1996, the all-items CPI for Canada increased
by 1.6 percent, the agency said, which calculated the annual
average index by averaging the indices for the 12 months of the
calendar year.
</P>
<P>
Higher inflation in December is being seen here as another sign
that the Canadian economy is moving.
</P>
<P>
The modest price rise also reduces the chance that the Bank of
Canada would cut interest rates further, analysts here said.

<HEADLINE> European Envoy to Help Restart Israeli-Syrian Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 23 (Xinhua) -- European special envoy
Miguel Angel Moratinos will launch a bid next week to resume the
stalled Israeli-Syrian negotiations, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos, also Spanish Ambassador to Israel, will travel to
Syrian capital Damascus Monday to discuss the Israeli-Syrian
peace track with Syrian leaders. He will try to nudge Israel
and Syria closer in order to resume the stalled peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The European envoy, who had been excluded by the United States
and Israel from meditating the Israeli-Palestinian talks on
Hebron pullback, is now in the best position to get the
Israeli-Syrian track moving, the report said.
</P>
<P>
One reason is that Syria is now angered by a series of moves by
the United States, the latest being its pressuring South Africa to
defer a 650-million-dollar deal on computerizing Syrian tanks'
fire systems, observers noted.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the outgoing U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher recently sent a message to Israel, claiming that the
understanding reached between Israel's previous Labor government
and Syria would not bind the current Likud government, they said.
</P>
<P>
Under the unsigned understanding, the Labor government declared
its willingness to totally withdraw from the Golan Heights,
which Israel seized in 1967 from Syria, in return for sealing a
peace pact with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Following the just-completed Hebron redeployment that helped
ease the tension in the region, Israel is increasing pressure on
Syria to come back to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
However, Syria has rejected repeated calls from Israel for
resuming the peace talks, insisting the negotiations should only
be reconvened on the basis of the understanding that it reached
with the Labor government.
</P>
<P>
The Likud government vowed in its police guidelines never to
relinquish the Golan Heights under excuses of protecting its
northern border and valuable water resources.
</P>
<P>
Israeli-Syrian peace talks broke off last March after a series
of Islamic suicide bombing attacks in Israel killed 58
people. Since the hardline Likud government came to power last
June, a military stand-off has been brewing in the border,
fueling rumors about a possible war.

<HEADLINE> Libyan Plane Flies Overseas Despite Embargo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Despite the U.N. air flight
embargo on Libya, a Libyan Airlines aircraft has made a
return trip between Libyan capital of Tripoli and Ghanian capital
of Accra, according to reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The Libyan news agency said the plane returned to Tripoli today
carrying a delegation of the Libyan Ministry of Foreign Affairs
which had official talks with Ghanian officials in Accra.
</P>
<P>
The report did not specify the route followed by the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Libyan authorities allowed the U.S. balloonist Steve Fosset to
transit its airspace aboard his balloon last Saturday. Then
Tripoli said it considered that the international embargo had been
lifted.
</P>
<P>
Libya also addressed a message to the U.N. Security Council
last week underlining that Tripoli would permit the transit and
landing of any aircraft overflying Libya and its airports, whereas
Libyan planes would resume flights at once to other countries of
the world.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council imposed the air flight embargo on
Libya in April 1992 after Libya refused to hand over two suspects
for blasting a Pan AM flight over Scotland in 1988, leaving 270
people dead.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in April 1994, Libyan pilgrims flew to Saudi Arabia to
perform pilgrimage, and, ever since, the U.N. Security Council had
permitted Egyptian planes to transport Libyan pilgrims to Mecca
in 1994 and 1995, taking off from Libyan airports.

BELGRADE, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Foreign Minister
Milan Milutinovic met today with Chief Prosecutor of the Hague
International Criminal Tribunal Louise Arbour on cooperation
between Yugoslavia and the tribunal.
</P>
<P>
Arbour, accompanied by her deputy Graham Blewitt, is paying a
several-day visit to Belgrade. This is Arbour's first visit to
Yugoslavia after she took over as chief prosecutor of the Hague
tribunal in October 1996.
</P>
<P>
The international war crimes tribunal was established in 1993
in line with a U.N. resolution to investigate and try the war
criminals in the former Yugoslavia. The court has listed 75 war
crime suspects, with only seven under custody and one being
sentenced.
</P>
<P>
Milutinovic and Arbour exchanged views on cooperation in the
sphere of war crimes investigation between Yugoslavia and the
tribunal, the Tanjug news agency quoted a Yugoslav Foreign
Ministry statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed that the opening of the Belgrade liaison
office of the Hague tribunal had added an extra momentum to the
cooperation, it said.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the office in August 1996 made it possible to
establish regular contacts between the Hague tribunal's
prosecution and Yugoslav authorities and non-governmental
organizations.
</P>
<P>
It had greatly facilitated the work of the tribunal's
investigators, including their access to victims of crimes
committed on the territory of the former Yugoslavia and potential
witnesses of those crimes who have found refuge in Yugoslavia, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Minister Milutinovic said he hoped prosecutor Arbour would help
the tribunal perform its duties in an unbiased way, which he noted
would improve the mutual cooperation and confidence, it added.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Promises US Dues Payment to UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today promised visiting U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan that he
will work with Congress to pay overdue U.S. dues to the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
"In the weeks ahead, I will be working with Congress to reach
an agreement through which America can pay our arrears to the
U.N., meet our obligations, and continue to spur real progress,"
Clinton said at the White House after meeting Annan.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., which contributes 25 percent of the U.N. regular
budget, owes the world body 1.3 billion U.S. dollars, bringing it
into deep financial trouble.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot expect to lead through the United Nations unless we
are prepared to pay our own money, and to pay what we owe, as they
do what they should along the path of reform," Clinton declared.
</P>
<P>
"As long as the United Nations does its part, we simply have to
be prepared to pay our debts and pay our dues," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters before meeting Clinton, Annan said, "I
don't think I should be seen as a beggar." He stressed that he
needs financial support to reform the U.N.
</P>
<P>
"If we do not change, we will lose our relevance," Annan said,
adding, "What the United Nations wants is what the U.S. also
wants: a reformed United Nations."
</P>
<P>
He added, "If they could release the money to us, we could get
on with the work of reform. We can get on with reshaping the U.N."
</P>
<P>
Prior to the meeting with Clinton, Annan met with U.S.
Vice-President Al Gore and the new secretary of state, Madeleine
Albright.
</P>
<P>
The diplomatic mission of the new U.N. chief is seen as a good
sign in relations between the U.N. and the U.S.
</P>
<P>
"I think that is a very good sign of the support that the
United States is going to give to the United Nations," Albright
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 44 House members signed a letter to Clinton, calling
for the fulfillment of the U.S. financial obligation to the U.N.,
or the U.S. will lose influence and further cripple the
organization.
</P>
<P>
Annan, on his first trip to Washington as the U.N.
secretary-general, is trying to convince the U.S. congressmen to
agree on paying U.S. dues to the U.N.
</P>
<P>
He said that he is "fairly certain" that in time the Congress
and the U.S. government will pay the debts. However, he stressed
that he is not sure when they will do it.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Zoologists Save Vultures from Extinction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Bird-lovers northern Israel
nowadays is surprised to see the vultures back in the nature
after 45 years of disappearance.
</P>
<P>
This is the result of an urgent rescue project carried out by
zoology Professor Amos Ar and his assistant Ohad Hatzofe in the
Tel Aviv University.
</P>
<P>
Through artificial hatchery, they have succeeded in increasing
the number of vultures which are otherwise facing extinction
because of low fertility rate and the environment disturbance.
</P>
<P>
Supported by the Rothschild Foundation and Society for
Protection of Nature in Israel, Ar and Hatzofe have conducted
basic researches on vultures about their embryo's metabolism and
eco-physiology, which were implemented in the hatching project.
</P>
<P>
The vultures reach sexual maturity between the ages of four
and six years. They are monogamous, and the females lay only one
egg a year. The couple court, build nests, and mate between
November and January, then incubate their egg until March. If
the egg hatches, the chick remains in the nest for about 110
days and even afterwards is fed by its parents.
</P>
<P>
Because of the heavy parental investment in a single chick,
any interference with nesting or harm to the egg may cause the
loss of a whole year and helicopter training near the breeding
colony in northern Israel has caused adult vultures to abandon
their nests.
</P>
<P>
Professor Ar collected vulture eggs from the wild and the zoo
to transfer to his hatching house. In order to increase the
hatching rate, he learned to pierce the shells with tiny needle
holes to rise the moisture.
</P>
<P>
Once hatched and weighing some 170 grams, the chicks are
adopted by vulture couples selected from the university's
zoological park. Using transmitters, the scientists identify and
follow the vultures after they are freed back into the
wild.

rapid growth in the number of foreign workers over recent years.
</P>
<P>
It became necessary, therefore, to have regulations control the
entry and exit of foreigners, authorities say, and ones that allow
tax bureaus to delay the departure of people who want to leave
without paying taxes or failing to provide a tax guarantor.
</P>
<P>
The bureaus can ask public security departments to stop people
who insist on leaving, the rule says, and that those concerned can
leave as soon as they pay all the back taxes, or provide a tax
guarantor.
</P>
<P>
Those who declare bankruptcy and have gone through the
necessary procedures in accordance with Chinese law, can leave
China.
</P>
<P>
If a legal person is behind in taxes, the legal representative
is prohibited from leaving, according to the rule.
</P>
<P>
In case there is change in the legal person or person in
charge, that person or persons will be stopped from leaving China
and, if the legal person is outside the country, the principal
leading person will be held responsible and forbidden from exiting
the country.

<HEADLINE> Macao to Step Up Localization of Law: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Macao Governor Vasco Rocha Vieira
pledged to step up the localization process of law and the legal
structure in Macao to "prepare for the future after the handover
of power."
</P>
<P>
The governor made these remarks on Thursday at an annual legal
meeting, which was attended by leading legal officials of the
government.
</P>
<P>
"The joint declaration signed by China and Portugal 10 years
ago means a guarantee for the future stability and prosperity of
Macao," he said in an address at the meeting. "The government will
make great efforts to fulfill the duty laid down in the joint
declaration to ensure that the Macao Special Administrative Region
will enjoy autonomy."
</P>
<P>
The governor said that as there is less than three years left
for the handover of Macao, it is urgent to localize the law and
the legal structure.
</P>
<P>
The priority is the training of personnel, he said, adding that
more local law officials, lawyers and court clerks will take
office this year and in 1998, following the first three local law
officials who assumed office last year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the overall legal structure currently in operation
will be localized so that it will stride over 1999.
</P>
<P>
General principles will be worked out to define the formation
and rights of the court of last resort and the court of second
instance, the duty of legal officials and the formation and rights
of bodies governing legal officials.
</P>
<P>
Vieira said that the court of first instance will be
restructured this year and that major laws including the civil
law, the business law and the law on civil procedure will be
prepared as well.
</P>
<P>
Two other leading localized laws -- the criminal code and the
law of criminal procedures -- were promulgated earlier.
</P>
<P>
"It will be a top priority of this year's work of the
government to continue the localization of law, so that Macao will
have modernized and future-oriented laws," he said.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Tap More Foreign Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines will open more
potentially big markets in 1997 for its export products as part of
its efforts to attain a 50 billion U.S. dollars export target by
the year 2000, the Department of Trade and Industry (DOTI) said
today.
</P>
<P>
While continuing to tap its traditional foreign markets, Trade
and Industry Secretary Cesar Bautista said the country will try to
increase its exports to East Europe, South America, South Africa
and India.
</P>
<P>
The country's traditional markets include East Asia, West
Europe, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the North
America Free Trade Area, which groups Canada, Mexico and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
These markets, of which the United States and Japan are the
Philippines' top two trading partners, account for 93 percent of
the country's total exports in 1996, according to Bautista.
</P>
<P>
Bautista said the country's trade deficit reached about 12
billion dollars in 1996, despite an 18 percent increase in the
exports, which outpaced the growth rate of imports for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
He said the country's trade deficit would be wiped out in the
next 10 years only if the growth rate of its exports continued to
outpace the growth rate of its imports.

<HEADLINE> China To Further Cooperation with UNESCO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- China will continue its
cooperation with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization (UNESCO) to serve the developing countries
in the fields of education, science and culture.
</P>
<P>
Wei Yu, director of the the Chinese National Commission for
UNESCO, promised China's support to UNESCO at an annual meeting
which opened in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
She promised the smooth undertaking of cooperative projects by
China and UNESCO while applying for more cooperation programs.
</P>
<P>
Wei, who is also the vice-minister of the State Education
Commission, viewed China's cooperation with UNESCO in the past
year as "fruitful" and "further improved."
</P>
<P>
She said that two events in 1996 exerted a positive impact on
UNESCO: Chinese President Jiang Zemin accepted UNESCO's invitation
to be a member of the World Solar Commission; And State Councillor
Luo Gan attended the World Solar Summit held in Harare, Zimbabwe,
on behalf of Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
The 30th International Geological Congress, the 62nd General
Conference of the International Federation of Library
Associations, and the 13th International Congress on Archives, all
supported by UNESCO, were respectively held in China.
</P>
<P>
The international conferences promoted the development of
relevant subjects in China, as well as enlarging China's influence
in international scientific circles.
</P>
<P>
China was also actively involved in UNESCO's activities, such
as national education in heavily populated countries, oceanology,
the "Man and Biosphere Project", informatics plan, and hydrologic
plan.
</P>
<P>
Wei said that China and UNESCO started some very meaningful
projects last year about movies, TV programs, radio broadcasting,
fashion design, cultural and natural heritage protection, and
non-material heritage protection. Such projects have helped
promote Chinese culture and increased cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Tops 120 Yen in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar continued its
rise in Tokyo today to hit a new 47-month high of 120.20 yen after
official comments that the weakening yen would have a favorable
impact on the Japanese economy.
</P>
<P>
The dollar ended the day at 119.94-97 yen at 5 p.m., up from
118.70-75 yen at 9 a.m., having hit an intraday low of 118.32 yen.
</P>
<P>
A senior Bank of Japan economist, commenting on the central
bank's quarterly report on economic prospects, said the yen's
recent weakening trend had affected the Japanese economy favorably.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the market was likely to remain nervous ahead of
the meeting of the Group of Seven industrialized nations on
February 8 in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
Top government spokesman Seiroku Kajiyama said today the yen
seemed to have reached its lower limit and that political and
business circles in Japan and the United States apparently
believed the dollar's range of around 110 to 120 yen is tolerable.

On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, stock prices fell sharply on a
steep decline on Wall Street overnight.

<HEADLINE> Massive Anti-measles Drive Launched in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- A massive anti-measles
immunization drive has been launched in Manila after the
contagious disease has killed 16 children in Manila and its nearby
provinces since January 1, Health Secretary Carmencita Reodica
said today.
</P>
<P>
Reodica said the move was taken as the number of
measles-stricken children admitted into the San Lazaro Hospital
(SLH), the main state-run infectious disease hospital in Manila,
continued to surge this week.
</P>
<P>
She said more places in Metro Manila were placed under close
watch this week after seven more children, all under five years
old, were claimed by the disease.
</P>
<P>
She said that health personnel were directed to find active
measles cases house by house so as to detect the disease early to
prevent complications that usually cause death.
</P>
<P>
Under the massive anti-measles drive, Reodica said all children
below five years old will be immunized. Normally, only children
aged nine to 12 months old are given anti-measles vaccines because
this group is the most vulnerable to contract the disease.
</P>
<P>
So far, 592 measles-infected children have been admitted into
the SLH and the death toll from the disease has risen to 16 as two
more infants, aged one year and six months respectively, died
early this morning.
</P>
<P>
According to Redocia, most of the cases and deaths were
children aged one to four years old. About 82 percent of the
victims were not vaccinated.
</P>
<P>
Despite the high number of measles cases and deaths, Reodica
explained that there is still no basis to declare an outbreak or
epidemic because there is no clustering or concentration of cases
in one specific area.
</P>
<P>
The cases come from different areas of Metro Manila and its
nearby provinces of Bulacan, Cavite and Rizal, she stressed.
</P>
<P>
Measles, transmitted through nose and throat discharges, is a
highly contagious viral disease affecting mostly children.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Rejects Israel's Charge against Resistance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Beirut announced today that
it has filed an objection to the United Nations over an
Israeli letter to Secretary General Kofi Annan that referred
to resistance attacks against Israel's occupation forces as
"terrorist operations."
</P>
<P>
The official Lebanese National News Agency said that Samir
Mubarak, Lebanese permanent representative at the U.N., has
delivered a letter to Annan objecting to the January 2
Israeli message.
</P>
<P>
"What Israel is calling terrorist operations are resistance
activities targeting Israeli occupation forces, which are taking
place on the Lebanese land," the state-run LNNA quoted the
Lebanese letter as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese government reiterated its readiness to ensure
security and legal sovereignty in south Lebanon after the
Jewish state pulls its forces out of the area in accordance
to U.N. Security Council Resolution 425, which calls for an
unconditional Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"The resistance is a term of legitmate right of self-defense
which is stipulated in international documents, and which is
aimed at liberating national lands from foreign occupation,"
Beirut said in the letter.
</P>
<P>
It blamed Israel for problems in south Lebanon, saying "the
Israeli occupation is the main reason for the continued
tension in the area which has caused many human tragedies as
well as destruction and suffering to Lebanese civilians."
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli political and security logic has proved its
failure in securing peace and security in the region and on
each side of the border," the letter added.
</P>
<P>
It underlined that "implementing resolutions passed by the
international community is the only way to security peace and
stability to the people of the Middle east."
</P>
<P>
Hit-and-run attacks by Lebanese guerrillas against the Israeli
occupation forces and its client militia and retaliatory
bombardments constitute a daily scene on the last active
battlefront of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
Israel turned the 1,100-square-kilometer occupied border strip
in south Lebanon into its "security zone" in 1985 to protect
its northern border from guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, some 185 Israeli soldiers and more than 800
others have been killed by Lebanese Moslem guerrillas in the
area.

<P>
BEIJING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin attended
a special Spring Festival performance today for military veterans
in Beijing for the upcoming lunar New Year and extended greetings
to retired army officers across the country, wishing them a joyful
Spring Festival, good health, and a happy life.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who is also General Secretary of the Communist Party of
China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military
Commission (CMC), said that 1996, the first year of China's Ninth
Five-Year Plan, was a good start for the plan and saw many
achievements in the nation's economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
"Under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the CMC,
the PLA and armed police have followed Deng Xiaoping's theory of
building the army by improving their quality through science and
technology, and have made new contributions to China's national
security and social stability," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that this year China will hold splendid celebrations
for the 70th anniversary of the founding of the PLA, and called on
the whole nation to work hard for China's prosperity and a
stronger national defense.
</P>
<P>
In praising their "immortal merit" in the struggle for national
independence and liberation, and their "great contributions" to
the development of China's military, Jiang said he hopes the
veterans will continue to show concern and support for the country
and the army, and to do more for socialist material, ethical, and
cultural progress.
</P>
<P>
Present at today's performance were CMC vice chairmen Liu
Huaqing, Zhang Zhen, Zhang Wannian, and Chi Haotian.

<HEADLINE> Ideal Winter Habitat for Cranes In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,000 red-crowned
cranes have migrated to a beach area of Sheyang County in northern
Jiangsu Province on China's east coast to spend the winter.
</P>
<P>
The beach is a state-level natural reserve for rare and
precious birds and provides an ideal habitat for the red-crowned
crane.
</P>
<P>
The cranes lead a fairly comfortable life there, foraging for
food, strolling about leisurely on the beach, and flying about
occasionally to stretch their wings.
</P>
<P>
In order to protect the rare fowl, the local government has set
up a police post near the zone, to enforce the ban on logging,
cutting down the reeds, and hunting animals.
</P>
<P>
In winter, some departments have also spent tens of thousands
of yuan on irrigating the marshland to make certain that the
red-crowned cranes get ample fish and shrimp, a staple part of
their diet.
</P>
<P>
The favorable environment has caused more red-crowned cranes to
come to spend the winter, and this year, some 1,020 have been
reported, compared to 775 last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAUNDA,January 24 (Xinhau) --The Angolan government today
censured former rebel UNITA (the national union for the total
independence of Angola ) of delaying the inauguration of the new
Angolan government.
</P>
<P>
The inauguration of the new Angolan government has been
scheduled for January 25, but it will be delayed as some key
issues concerning the formation of the new government have not
yet been settled by the two former rival groups.
</P>
<P>
The inauguration of the new government has to be delayed
because UNITA hasn't decided who will be appointed as
parliamentarians in the new government, government spokesman
Higino Carneiro said in a statement today.
</P>
<P>
He said that the new government's inauguration date can only
be decided after all the elected UNITA parliamentary members
arrive in the capital of Launda.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the post of the UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi in
the new government, Carneiro said that Angolan government
and the UNITA are continuing discussions about the issue.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Refuses Jordan's Protest over Release of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister
Farez Boueiz stressed here today that a protest raised by
Jordan over Lebanon's decision to release and deport three
Iraqi diplomats were totally unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
At the end of a meeting with Prime Minister Rafik Hariri,
Boueiz confirmed that his government has received a protest
from Jordan, underlining that "neither the contents nor the
form" of the protest was acceptable.
</P>
<P>
Arab diplomatic sources said that relations between Beirut
and Amman soured following the "sharply-worded" protest by
Jordan against Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The three Iraqi diplomats, Ali Sultan Darwish, Mohammed Fares
Kazem and Hadi Hassoun Najim were detained by the Lebanese
authorities after the April 1994 assassination of an Iraqi
opposition leader in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
The slain Iraqi, Taleb Al-Souheil Tamimi, reportedly carried
a Jordanian passport and was a close friend of Jordan's King
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
However, after nearly three years of detention, the Lebanese
Foreign Ministry said last week that the three Iraqis could
not be tried in Lebanon because they enjoyed diplomatic
immunity.
</P>
<P>
On a condition of anonymity, the reliable diplomatic sources
said that the Jordanian protest contained "a very serious
accusation that the release decision was breath of Lebanon's
commitment to combating terrorism."
</P>
<P>
The protest was delivered to Lebanon's ambassador in Amman,
William Habib, by Jordan's Royal Court chief Aoun Khawashneh,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese foreign minister told reporters, "the
international law gives diplomats full and absolute immunity and
no judicial authorities in the world have the right to try
diplomats."
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who believes that he raises the issue in term of
the international law should know and have trust in the
law," the foreign minister added.

<HEADLINE> HK Shipping Industry Welcome Shipping Links Across Straits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong shipowners and port
operators are enthusiastic about the prospect of direct shipping
links between Taiwan and the Chinese mainland, local media
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Port Development Board Secretary Richard Yuen said that of the
total container throughput of 13.3 million TEUs (20-foot
equivalent units) in 1996, only eight percent had been shipped between
the Chinese mainland and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He said that some of that traffic involved shipments from the
Pearl River Delta area to Taiwan, which would not be much hurt by
direct links with Fujian and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong is the natural catchment for Pearl River Delta
trade, no matter where it is going," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Shipowners' Association chairman George Chao said the
percentage of trade going through Hong Kong would drop but overall
shipment would increase.
</P>
<P>
The shipowners said that any immediate loss in shipping
business would be offset by improved trade on the whole.
</P>
<P>
Stephen Ip Shukwan, secretary for Economic Services, said that
initial estimates were that about one million containers
transshipped through the territory between Taiwan and the mainland
would be affected.
</P>
<P>
The shipping sectors of the Chinese mainland and Taiwan
Wednesday in Hong Kong reached a consensus on technical issues
concerning direct shipping between the selected ports of Fuzhou
and Xiamen on the mainland, and Kaohsiung Port in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong Standard" cited some observers' words as saying that
Hong Kong needed to improve its competitiveness and price if the
territory's port was not to lose out in future.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Monetary
Authority (HKMA) announced here today that at the end of December
1996, Hong Kong's foreign exchange reserves stood at 63.8 billion
US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The figure represents an increase of 15 percent over the
corresponding figure of 1995.
</P>
<P>
An HKMA spokesman said that on this basis, Hong Kong has
maintained its seventh position in the world ranking of foreign
exchange reserve holdings.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, including forward transactions to
be settled, Hong Kong's foreign exchange reserves at the end of
1996 were 69.6 billion US dollars, 22 percent higher than that
recorded at the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that these figures do not include Hong
Kong's foreign exchange reserves held in the Land Fund.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the HKMA decided to disclose Hong Kong's
foreign exchange reserve figures monthly rather than quarterly.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Yam, HKMA's chief executive, said that it is part of our
on-going effort to increase transparency in HKMA's operations.
</P>
<P>
HKMA has progressed from annual to half-yearly, quarterly and
now to monthly release of figures on foreign exchange reserves.

LAGOS, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The federal government of
Nigeria has ordered the reconstitution of the leadership of 19
out of the 21 universities in the country.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Minister of Education mohammed Liman said in a
statement that the governing councils of the remaining two
universities, the University of Nigeria and the Ahmadu Bello
University will be reshaped later.
</P>
<P>
It is belived that the reorganization is connected with the
prolonged strikes by university teachers and students nationwide
in 1996 which led to the actual paralysis of the country's higher
education sector.
</P>
<P>
The teachers demanded higher salaries and better funding for
universities, while the students were angered by the increasing
tuition fees.
</P>
<P>
The government's newly-released budget for 1997 allocated
16.84 billion Naira (about 201 million U.S. Dollars ) for the
education sector, 1.5 billion Naira more than that of 1996.

<HEADLINE> Granny Huang and Her Ten Adopted Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Life as a successful
restaurateur hasn't diverted Huang Shuqing's attention from needy
orphans.
</P>
<P>
Over the past nine years, the 66-year-old benefactress has
adopted ten kids, and added 12 restaurants to her company's chain.
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Huang, chairman of the board of Shuangshengyuan Food
Company in northeast China's port city of Dalian, met Qu Yanying,
a young girl suffering from meningitis, who was a patient in the
Children's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
When Huang discovered the girl's mother, who is mute, could not
afford the huge medical bills, Huang paid them. And when the girl
recovered, Huang received permission to adopt her.
</P>
<P>
She also adopted Zhao Xiuli, 14, who was unable to finish
primary school education following the death of her parents. Then
came Dang Jie, 9, who was in an orphanage and had recently had
surgery for a cleft palate, a deformity of the lower jaw.
</P>
<P>
Huang's sympathy for children in unfortunate circumstances
stems from her own childhood: her father died when she was young,
and she and her mother were forced to beg in the streets of their
hometown, and later in Dalian.
</P>
<P>
"I will provide the children with good education and let them
contribute to the country with their skills when they grow up,"
Huang said.
</P>
<P>
Qu Yanying, Huang's first adopted daughter, is now a healthy
young woman with a job. "I should thank Mother Huang for
everything I've got," she said.
</P>
<P>
Three of Huang's adopted children are studying in primary
schools, and the rest are in kindergarten.
</P>
<P>
Each holiday season, Huang arranges a family get-together for
her entire clan, including her own four children, her adopted
children and some grandsons and granddaughters.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, she supports six childless widows and widowers. And
she has donated more than 700,000 yuan (84,000 US dollars) to
schools and old folks' homes in the past few years.

KUWAIT CITY, January 24 (Xinhua)--Saudi Arabia and Jordan
called on resumption of the Middle East peace process on all
tracks and demanded Israel to respect all its commitments and
agreements to realize just and comprehensive peace in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait News Agency reports from Saudi capital of Riyadh today
said the Saudi King Fahd and Jordanian King Hussein agreed
Thursday night that the Middle East peace talks should rest on
the U.N Security Council resolutions 242, 338 and 425 as well as
Madrid principle of land for peace.
</P>
<P>
The visiting Jordanian king discussed with the Saudi monarch
the recent developments of the Middle East peace process in the
light of the Hebron deal between the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the PNA struck the deal on January 15, ending a
year delay of Israeli troop redeployment from the West Bank city.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, King Hussein elaborated on the efforts he
made to end the stalemate in talks between the PNA and Israel on
Hebron, reports said. During its session last Monday, The Saudi
cabinet welcomed the deal and considered it a step towards
achieving lasting peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
The talks also touched on bilateral relations and ways of
upgrading their level in various fields including economic
cooperation, trade exchanges and employment of Jordanian
workforce in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The talks were attended by Saudi Crown Prince, Deputy Prime
Minister and Chief of the National Guards Prince Abdullah Bin
Abdelaziz, Interior Minister Prince Nayef Bin Abdelaziz, Foreign
Minister Saoud Al-Faisal and other Saudi high ranking officials.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein arrived at Saudi Arabian second holy city of
Al-Madina Thursday morning on his second visit to the Kingdom in
five months for talks with Saudi King Fahd Bin Abdul Aziz and to
pay pilgrimage.
</P>
<P>
He was seen off by King Fahd and other Saudi high officials
at the airport late last night.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein visited the Saudi coastal city of Jeddah last
August and held his first meeting with King Fahd since the end
of the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's ties with its largest southern neighbor and other
Gulf Arab states were strained when King Hussein refused to join
Saudi Arabia and other Arab and Western countries in condemning
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Saudi oil supplies to Jordan were cut off the next month and
Amman was forced to rely solely on Iraq for its energy needs.
</P>
<P>
Things began to improve when King Hussein turned against
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein after the defection of two senior
Iraqi officers to Jordan in 1994 and relations between the two
countries improved dramatically after King Hussein's last visit
to Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of the Gulf War, King Hussein made his first
visit to Saudi Arabia in February, 1994, but he was not received
by Saudi King Fahd.

<HEADLINE> Exports From Philippines' Subic Bay Soar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' Subic Bay
Freeport shipped out a total of 331 million U.S. dollars' worth of
exports in 1996, an almost 100-percent increase from its 1995
figure of 174 million dollars, according to Trade and Investment
officials.
</P>
<P>
Records of the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority (SBMA) showed
that the amount of exports by Subic manufacturers exceeded by 31
million dollars the 300 million dollar target which the SBMA set
for 1996.
</P>
<P>
"Subic's exports have taken geometrical increases during the
last three years because of the continuous arrival of foreign
investors lured by the attractiveness of the investment climate in
Subic," SBMA chairman Richard said in a press statement today.
</P>
<P>
Documents also revealed that total exports in 1995 alone, at
174 million dollars, were a 629-percent rise from that of 1994's
24 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Last year, electronic products accounted for about 76 percent
of the export figures of Subic.
</P>
<P>
Access to the Subic Bay Freeport, which the SBMA sees as the
next Asian transshipment hub, has been eased with the completion
late last year of the 6.8-kilometer Subic-Tipo expressway leading
to the freeport and the opening of the Subic Bay International
Airport.
</P>
<P>
The freeport has already accepted a total of 257 commitments
from investors, bringing the projected investments to some 1.9
billion dollars.

<P>
MANILA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The southern Philippine city of
Iloilo is seeking a sisterhood pact with a coastal city in the
eastern Chinese province of Shangdong, the Philippine News Agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations for the pact have been underway between officials
from Iloilo, capital of the southern Iloilo province, and Qingdao,
about 500 kilometers southeast of the Chinese capital Beijing, the
news agency said.
</P>
<P>
A delegation of four officials from Qingdao is expected to
finalize the discussions when they visit Iloilo city in late
February, Iloilo city mayor Mansueto Malabor was quoted as saying
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Malabor said Henry Tong, executive director of the Association
for Philippines-China Understanding, had informed him of the
Qingdao municipal government's intention to visit Iloilo for the
purpose.
</P>
<P>
Malabor said he had extended an invitation to the city
officials of Qingdao to visit Iloilo and discuss various aspects
of establishing a city sisterhood pact and other cultural
exchanges that may ensue thereafter.
</P>
<P>
Iloilo has presently a sisterhood treaty with Stockton city in
California and an informal sister pact with Ichon city in South
Korea.

WELLINGTON, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Carl Lewis of the United
States finished a distance seventh over 100 meters Friday at the
Robin Tait Classic track and field meet in Auckland, New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
In his first outing of the year, the 35-year-old Lewis, who won
the Atlanta Olympics long jump, was easily beaten by fellow
American David Oaks, who won in 10.28 seconds, and a field of
mainly local runners. Lewis wound up 10.76.
</P>
<P>
Lewis, who has a best of 9.86 seconds over 100 meters set in
1991, was unfazed by the loss. He said he wasn't entirely ready
and nor was he expecting to be strongly competitive.
</P>
<P>
``I've been competing for 16 years and so I was relaxed tonight
and I think I'm allowed to do that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
``I will get better as the year goes on, but I don't think I
want to compete as intensely as I have in the past. I've enjoyed
being here and the way this meet has been organized.''
</P>
<P>
Lewis, the owner of nine Olympic gold medals, has twice won the
100-meter gold at the Olympics.

<HEADLINE> Inauguration of Angola's New Government Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The inauguration of Angola's
national unity government, scheduled for January 25, will be
postponed "indefinitely", for which the Angola government blamed
the former rebel UNITA movement.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made public last night by U.N. special
representative Blondin Beye after consulting with the Angolan
government and the National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
He said the reason for the delay is that UNITA officials would
not arrive at the capital until February 12, adding that the
opening of the National Assembly, due to be held on January 17,
was also delayed because the UNITA members of parliament did not
reach Luanda as planned.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. mediator noted that the new dates for the
inaugurations cannot be set until all of the UNITA officials and
MPs arrive at the capital.
</P>
<P>
He also pledged that he will hold "intense consultations" with
all sides concerned in the Angolan peace process to decide on the
dates for the inaugurations, especially a post for UNITA leader
Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Angolan government today accused UNITA of
failing to realize the tasks set under the Lusaka peace agreement
as scheduled, thus causing the postponement.
</P>
<P>
However, spokesman for the Angolan government told reporters
that he felt regretted about the delay, but added this does not
mean that the peace process has fallen into dire straits.

<P>
FREETOWN, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Alleged torture and
forced confessions were conducted at the treason trial of eight
soldiers including a woman Sergeant, now going on in the west
African state of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
At the trial's session today, third accused Joseph Yajah told
Judge Henry Cowan that plainclothes police officers gave him
''electric shocks and burned'' his head with cigarettes to force
him to change his statement.
</P>
<P>
Yajah, led in evidence by defense lawyer Gabriel Baion, said
the officers took him from the maximum security prison (in the
capital) last September where he was detained in connection with
the coup plot to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID)
where the deputy head of the organization, Samuel Soumassa urged
him to change his statement.
</P>
<P>
''I refused,'' Yajah said, ''and I was then tied to a chair in
the crack squad office.''
</P>
<P>
He went on, ''I was stripped naked, ice water was poured on me
and a cable from a tape recorder was plugged into a socket and i
was given four terrible shocks. The officers stuffed a cap in my
mouth when i screamed in agony.''
</P>
<P>
Yajah, a former security officer at state house also claimed
that a sub inspector put out a cigarette ''on his head'' and
"ordered other men to scratch my back with wire. they also
prevented a Sierra Leone Red Cross official from seeing me
afterwards.''
</P>
<P>
Yajah who showed the court wounds he said he received from the
torture, later signed confessions under pressure.

A police inspector in the trial later denied Yajah's
accusation.

push forward the process of peaceful reunification.
</P>
<P>
The meeting described the year of 1996 as an unordinate one for
the growth of the relations across the straits.
</P>
<P>
It noted that phased important results have been scored in the
struggle against splitting activities and "Taiwan independence",
which fully shows the Chinese people's strong determination and
capability to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial
integrity.
</P>
<P>
The demand for furthering such relationship by the compatriots
across the Taiwan Straits, and the prompt realization of
direct mail, trade links and air and shipping services has become
stronger by the day.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Rejects Incorrect Press Reports on Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus today rejected some
incorrect press reports that the tourism on this eastern
Mediterranean island has been hit as a result of the Cyprus
government's decision to buy anti-aircraft missiles from Russia.
</P>
<P>
In an official statement to Xinhua, the Cyprus Tourism
Organization (CTO), a semi-government organization responsible for
 the planning, promotion and marketing of the tourist industry,
said it has no confirmed information of any tourist cancellations
because of the decision of the government to buy defensive
anti-aircraft missiles.
</P>
<P>
The CTO's statement came following the press reports that the
Cyprus' government's decision to buy Russian-made missiles could
hit island's tourism and damage its economy.
</P>
<P>
Kyriakos Jacovides, a CTO official who signed the statement
for the Director General, told Xinhua that the situation in
Cyprus is very normal and peaceful.
</P>
<P>
"As a proof of that, we can invoke the decision of about 250
football teams from Central and North Europe to have their Winter
preparation in Cyprus between February and mid-March," he said.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, he added that a Scandinavian Football Cup will
take place in Cyprus from February 20 to March 2.
</P>
<P>
As part of Winter tourism, the Akamas International Chamber
Music Festival will take place in the western coastal town of
Paphos from February 8 to February 23, in which world famous
soloists and ensembles will participate, Jacovides said.
</P>
<P>
The official also told Xinhua that at present, more than 400
travel agents and conference organizers from different countries
of the world are gathering in Cyprus, aimed at promoting the
island as a quality and peaceful tourist destination.
</P>
<P>
Tension has escalated on the island after Cyprus signed on
January 4 a contract with Russia to buy 400 million U.S. dollars
worth of surface-to-air S-300 missiles with a range of 150
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The deal has triggered U.S. criticism and Turkey has
threatened that it will strike at the missiles if they are
deployed.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus Mail reported Tuesday that Cyprus bookings by British
holidaymakers are down this month by as much as 40 percent,
mainly because of the recent "missile crisis."
</P>
<P>
Tour operator said that British holidaymakers make up the bulk
of tourists to Cyprus and January is the month when they make
most bookings, estimated between 10 to 15 percent of the annual
total.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the reservations for the Summer of 1997, Jacovides
said "it is too early to draw any conclusions."
</P>
<P>
"We know that 1997 will be a difficult year, especially due to
the intense international competition in the field of tourism,
but we expect that tourist arrivals will be about the same number
as last year," the official said.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, more than 2 million foreign tourists visited the
island, from whom the country earned about 1.6 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In a recent meeting in Nicosia, CTO Chairman Antonis
Andronikou predicted a very difficult year ahead for island's
tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
However, he revealed that in an effort to reverse the
unfavorable situation, the CTO has adopted a new marketing
technique which aims at enhancing Cyprus' image abroad by
emphasizing quality, environment, human factor and the island's
culture.
</P>
<P>
Efforts are also underway to promote specialized packages for
conferences, sports, special interests and agrotourism. Emphasis
is also being placed on tourist packages for senior citizens,
according to Andronikou.
</P>
<P>
Tourism provides 21 percent of the Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) and represents 40 percent of total foreign currency
earnings for this island country.

<HEADLINE> Germany Urges India to Further Open up Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Germany today wanted India to
open up its insurance sector and give free-market access in the
service field.
</P>
<P>
Visiting German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, who was
addressing a joint news conference along his Indian counterpart
I.K. Gujral, said India must create a sound infrastructural base
to attract greater investments from abroad.
</P>
<P>
Assuring that Germany would continue to invest in India, Kinkel
said the on-going economic liberalization in India must proceed at
a brisk pace while at the same time ensuring "transparency" in all
government decisions.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel, who arrived here on Thursday for a three-day official
visit, said Germany was willing to assist India in developing its
infrastructure like in the fields of telecommunications, road and
ports.
</P>
<P>
The German foreign minister also said he had "canvassed" for
the airbus industries during his visit here and wanted the Indian
government to choose its version of medium capacity long range
aircraft for Air India.
</P>
<P>
Germany has a major stake along with France in the airbus
consortium.

<HEADLINE> HK's Return Expected to Benefit Inland Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's return to Chinese
sovereignty in July will help inland companies to raise funds on
the world capital market, according to securities officials and
experts.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong will help inland Chinese enterprises in pooling
funds from the world market by remaining as the major venue
for their listings overseas, the officials and experts said during
a conference on overseas listings.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong has become a gathering place for Chinese companies
listed overseas and will remain so in the future," an official of
the Department of International Operations of the China Securities
Regulatory Commission (CSRC), told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The reason is that Hong Kong is closely linked to the mainland
geographically, culturally and historically, he explained, noting
that such connections will grow stronger after its July 1 return.
</P>
<P>
The Securities Commission of the State Council, China's highest
administrative body, announced the fourth group of 38 state-owned
Chinese enterprises for overseas listing in late December.
</P>
<P>
As the date of Hong Kong's return to the mainland is
approaching, the golden time for inland companies to be listed
overseas has arrived, according to Edgar Cheng, chairman of the
Stock Exchange of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"It's the right time to list mainland companies overseas and to
consolidate Hong Kong's position as a `home market' for mainland
firms," Cheng said, adding that his exchange is very optimistic
about the prospects for listing inland enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-four of the 26 Chinese companies listed overseas since
1993 landed in Hong Kong, raising a total of 27.2 billion Hong
Kong dollars so far.
</P>
<P>
Observers say that Hong Kong's status as a major financial
center in the world, and its close link with the inland have
enabled Chinese enterprises to effectively raise much-needed funds
from the international capital market.
</P>
<P>
Listing shares in Hong Kong has also helped Chinese firms to
improve their operations, and made their products better known
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Major inland Chinese firms, mostly the most efficient in the
sectors such as the heavy industry, energy and construction, have
in turn helped improve the structure of the Hong Kong securities
market and strengthened Hong Kong's role as a global financial
hub, observers say.
</P>
<P>
"We agree with the CSRC on this point," Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
However, the CSRC official said that listing shares overseas
provides an opportunity for further development, but does not mean
everything.
</P>
<P>
"Enterprises must make good use of the opportunity to improve
their operations and efficiency," he noted.
</P>
<P>
His view was shared by Wang Delin, a delegate to the conference
from the Jilin Chemical Industrial Company, which was listed in
Hong Kong over a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that it is less expensive for Chinese companies to
raise funds at home.
</P>
<P>
But the non-standard disclosure of information and irregular
operations have made domestic listing of limited use in helping
enterprises transform their operating mechanisms, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese enterprises will feel compelled to improve their
operations only after they enter a developed capital market like
Hong Kong's," he said.

<HEADLINE> Power Rationing to Ease by June in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The current power rationing
will ease by the end of June this year under the Least Cost Power
Expansion Program for the next five years, the Kenya Times
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted out-going Minister of Energy Katan Ngala as
disclosing here on Thursday that the World Bank had released 125
million U.S. Dollars toward Kenya's electricity expansion
program.
</P>
<P>
The money is used to implement projects under the Least Cost
Power Expansion Program, said Ngata who has been transferred to
the Ministry of Lands and Settlement.
</P>
<P>
The current power generation capacity in Kenya stands at 800
megawatts while neighboring Uganda is supposed to supply a
maximum of 30 megawatts.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, another 88 megawatts will be added to the
existing power generation capacity in the first half of this year
to address the current rationing of power in the east African
country.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the Kenyan government announced the
decentralization of the operations of the Kenya Power and
Lighting Company (KPLC) and the establishment of the Kenya Power
Company to deal exclusively with the generation of electricity in
the country.
</P>
<P>
The KPLC will continue to be responsible for the transmission
and distribution of electricity throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
The power expansion program and the operation restructuring
would help ease the power shortage in Kenya, which has become one
of the bottlenecks adversely effecting the growth of all sectors
in Kenya's economy.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Push for Farm Products Liberalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Thailand plans to push for
liberalization of processed agricultural products, according to a
Thai Commerce Ministry official.
</P>
<P>
Thailand would raise the issue at the senior officials' meeting
of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), scheduled to be
held shortly to discuss preparations for the annual ministerial
meeting later this year in Canada, Rachandra Pojanasuntorn, deputy
director general of the Business Economics Department, said on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Rachandra said it is time for APEC members to discuss farm
liberalization after the so-called quadripartite group, consisting
the United States, Canada, the European Union and Japan, succeeded
in pushing through its agenda to liberalize information technology
products.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has potential in food and agricultural processing as
well as hand-made products.
</P>
<P>
"We must strongly push for their liberalization under APEC," he
said.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Raps Japanese Right-Wing Militarism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Japan should take a resolute
step to reckon with its past war crimes in order to win back the
trust of the international community, said the daily Rodong Sinmun
of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) today.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese authorities cannot escape the historic
responsibility for its past aggression and crimes, said the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The successive post-war governments of Japan have never
admitted the crimes against the Korean people, who had been
subject to a 40-odd-year Japanese colonial rule, it said.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Japanese governments have sought to whitewash and
justify what the newspaper called "thrice-cursed" war crimes.
</P>
<P>
Rodong Sinmun said Japan has encountered overwhelming
opposition against its attempt to become a permanent member of the
United Nations Security Council as a result of its refusal to
reckon with its past history of aggression.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper cited Germany as a good example, saying it has
won the trust of international community because it officially
admitted its war crimes against mankind and apologized for them.
</P>
<P>
Last year Japan triggered waves of protest from other Asian
countries after Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto visited
the Yasukuni Shrine, which holds tablets of many Japanese war
criminals, and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party decided to
request visiting foreign envoys to pay homage to the shrine.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Takami Eto, a member of the Japanese House
of Representatives, reportedly said that the treaty that
effectively put the Korean Peninsula under Japanese rule was a
"country-to-country treaty" which can hardly be called invasion.
</P>
<P>
He also doubted the credibility of the claim of Korean "comfort
women" who were forced into sexual slavery by the Japanese army
during World War II.

<HEADLINE> Opposition Responsible for All Blasts: Nigerian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The police authority of Nigeria
said the National Democratic Coalition (NADECO), an opposition
organization, is responsible for the bomb blasts that hit the
country in recent times, local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
The inspector-general of the police, Alhaji Ibrahim Coomassie,
revealed this at a press briefing at the police force
headquarters in Abuja on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The police head said that investigations by a special task
force have led to conclusive evidences of NADECO's involvement in
those acts of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
He continued that the police is also investigating the
involvement of some foreign countries in the spate of bomb
explosions.
</P>
<P>
The police specifically accused four persons of deep
involvement, which are retired Lieutenant-General Alani
Akinrinade, now self-exiled in London, chief Olu Falae, a former
finance minister; Dr. Amos Arogundade Akingba, a businessman and
Nelson Kassim, a computer expert also based in London.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Amos Akingba was declared wanted for harboring Nelson
Kassim and funding his 12 trips between London and Lagos on
errands connected with explosion conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
Nelson Kassim had died in a car bomb on November 14, 1996 on
his way to the Lagos international airport. It is believed Kassim
was holding a bomb on his lap when the accident happened.
</P>
<P>
The police said Akingba's residence at no. 7, Sule Abuka
Cresent, Ikeja, Lagos, a property of Akingrinade, was the
operational base of all the bomb attacks so far recorded in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Akingba was arrested after the November 14 bomb but later
jumped police bail and fled to London.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Allows 7 Firms to Do Business in DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean government today
permitted seven South Korean companies to do business in the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) through contact with
DPRK people in a third country.
</P>
<P>
The seven firms include Korea Green Cross and Taechang, which
have already been allowed to do business in the DPRK, Donghae
Tongsang, National Services, Lotte, LG International and Shin Won.
</P>
<P>
Such permits had not been issued since last September when
South Korea accused 26 armed DPRK military personnel of
"infiltrating into" the country from a grounded submarine.
</P>
<P>
Korea Green Cross, which was allowed in September 1995 to
invest in the DPRK, plans to invest 3 million U.S. dollars in the
construction of a pharmaceutical plant, while Taechang, which
received its go-ahead in last April, will invest 5.8 million
dollars in the development of mineral water springs.
</P>
<P>
Donghae Tongsang plans to invest in a granite quarry in the
DPRK, National Services in duck meat production and processing,
Lotte in food and beverages, LG International in television set
assembly and Shin Won in textiles.
</P>
<P>
On December 29 last year, Pyongyang issued a statement,
expressing "deep regret" over the submarine incident that caused
the "tragic loss of human life." The statement was welcomed by
Seoul.

<P>
BEIJING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- China has formed the first
manufacturing base for "intelligent cable," a special
multifunctional cable supporting computer networks, in Jiangsu
Province, to provide more advanced cable for the country's
information superhighway.
</P>
<P>
Known as "No.5 Cable," the intelligent cable developed by
Jiangsu-based Zhongtian Optical Cable Group has passed a technical
appraisal by experts from China's ministries of posts and
telecommunications, electronics industry and broadcast, film and

</P>
<P>
The intelligent cable can be used in "intelligent buildings,"
office buildings based on high-speed computer networks, and other
computer webs linked to the information superhighway subscribers.
</P>
<P>
Involving 40 million yuan, the intelligent cable project by
Zhongtian Group has an annual manufacturing capacity of 50,000 km
of cables. The equipment for the project was imported from
Austria, Switzerland and France.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Willing to Renew Dialogue with Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister
Abdul Karim Kabariti has sent a letter to his Israeli
counterpart Binyamin Netanyahu and Foreign Minister David Levy
this week, calling for a renewal of the dialogue between the
two countries in view of the Hebron accord.
</P>
<P>
According to an Israel Radio report this morning, the
letter was delivered personally to Netanyahu and Levy by Omar
Rifai, Jordan's Ambassador to Israel.
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Kabariti praised the Israeli and Palestinian
leaders for reaching the Hebron accord, and hoped that peace would
gain as a result. "The leaders of Israel have shown courage in
shouldering their responsibility in nurturing peace in the Middle
East," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We salute the leadership of Israel and the Palestinian
people for their courage and fortitude in overcoming the
numerous obstacles which delayed signing the agreement," the
letter read.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian prime minister also said that his country
would continue to support all peace builders in the region
to the best of its ability and resources.
</P>
<P>
"Jordan's commitment to build and sustain a strong peace in
the Middle East, built on mutual trust and confidence, and
on warm relations among all the peoples of the region, is
unwavering," he said in the letter.
</P>
<P>
The move ended the strain that has cast a shadow over
the bilateral relations for the last several months since Israel
opened the Western Wall Tunnel exit in Jerusalem's Old City
last September.
</P>
<P>
The first sign of rapprochement was evident earlier this month
when Jordan's King Hussein stopped in Tel Aviv after visiting
Gaza to broker the compromise that helped seal the accord on the
Hebron redeployment and further Israeli pullbacks in the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Israeli officials in Jerusalem as saying
that the challenge for Netanyahu and Hussein would be to
renew their personal relationship and thus revive bilateral ties
between the two states.
</P>
<P>
Hussein, who revered Rabin for being a clear-eyed realist
about moderate and radical forces in the region, did not
enjoy the same close relationship with Rabin's successor, Shimon
Peres.
</P>
<P>
The Netanyahu-Hussein personal links suffered a key setback
after Hussein blamed the prime minister for an inconclusive
end to a Washington summit, which occurred in the aftermath
of the tunnel incident.
</P>
<P>
At the time, Hussein blamed Netanyahu for an "arrogance of
power."
</P>
<P>
Rifai said that Jordan could anticipate a visit by Netanyahu to
Jordan, but did not believe it would occur before the end of
Ramadan, the Islamic holy month of fasting.

<HEADLINE> Sino-US Venture Is Top Supplier of Switching Machines in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Ten Chinese provinces and
cities are to give their telephone sectors a major boost by
creating millions of new phone lines.
</P>
<P>
They plan to buy switching machines that will provide 2.45
million lines from a Sino-Lucent Technologies joint venture in
Qingdao, Shandong Province. The aim is to largely improve the
transmission volume and speed of the country's telephone networks.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a ceremony to receive the ISO9001 quality
certificate from the International Quality System Certification
Agency, DNV, Michael Shen, president of Lucent Technologies
Qingdao Telecom Equipment Ltd., said that the venture, which was
founded in 1995, has sold more than two million lines of its
5ESS-2000 switch gears in China. The venture has extended its
market to 12 coastal provinces and municipalities.
</P>
<P>
Developed by Bell Laboratories in 1992, the 5ESS-2000 machine
is the most advanced switching system in the world with a large
transmission volume and high transmission speed.
</P>
<P>
According to a memorandum of understanding signed by Lucent
Technologies and China's State Planning Commission, Lucent
Technologies will transfer 5ESS-2000 technology to China.
</P>
<P>
The Qingdao-based joint venture currently has a single-shift
manufacturing capacity of 1.5 million lines of switching equipment
per year, with the proportion of domestic products in the
technical support system accounting for 78 per cent.
</P>
<P>
Shen said that the venture is the biggest manufacturing center
for program-controlled switch gears Lucent Technologies has ever
launched outside the US. Its output now accounts for eight
percent of the country's switching machine market.
</P>
<P>
Located in a hi-tech zone in Qingdao, the venture involves a
joint investment of 100 million US dollars from Lucent
Technologies and four Chinese partners. It is the largest joint
venture in the city.

NAIROBI, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
signed 23.6 million U.S. Dollars grant agreements with the
European Union (EU) to carry out several projects, according to a
Daily Nation report today.
</P>
<P>
About 5.6 million Dollars out of the amount will be used to

Tanzania, Rwanda and Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's Micro-Enterprise Support Program will receive more

Program will get over 6 million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The financial accords were signed by EU Head of Delegation to

</P>
<P>
The Micro enterprise support project is aimed at improving
performance of business with up to 10 employees and a potential

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Syrian Talks Possiblly to Resume in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The stalled Israeli-Syrian
peace talks could resume in this spring, Israeli Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai was quoted as saying today.
</P>
<P>
The minister was quoted by the state-run Israel Radio as
saying that, before the talks are resumed, the two sides should
find ways to reach understandings and scale down the threatening
language.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the continued stalemate in the peace talks and
the tension in south Lebanon could lead to explosion.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai said that Israel was doing its utmost to calm down
the situation, but he repeated his objection to Israel's
unilateral withdrawal from the occupied south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Army Chief of Staff Amnon Lipkin Shahak
said he did not think a war with Syria was possible in the near
future. But he did not entirely rule out the possibility of an
armed conflict "at some point," a term that he declined to
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Shahak noted that Syria was truly interested in making peace
with Israel one year ago, but now it has changed its stand.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted Israeli officials as saying that Syria
intended to use terrorism as a leverage in dealing with Israel
in the absence of the progress in peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Following the recent Hebron redeployment, Israel seems to be
shifting its attention to resuming the peace talks with Syria by
repeatedly waving olive branches to Damascus.
</P>
<P>
In a move signaling Israel's flexibility in future talks,
Foreign Minister David Levy said Wednesday that Israel would
accept the United Nations Resolution 242 as basis for resuming
talks with Syria. The resolution calls for returning the
territories that Israel seized in the 1967 War in order to seal
peace.
</P>
<P>
Syria, however, has rejected Israel's latest peace calls,
insisting that the talks should only be restarted from the point
where they broke off last year, namely on the basis of the
understanding which it reached with the Israel's previous Labor
government.
</P>
<P>
In the unsigned understanding, Israel declared its willingness
to totally withdraw from the Golan Heights, which Israel seized
in 1967 from Syria, in return for sealing a peace pact with
Syria.
</P>
<P>
The current Likud government vowed in its police guidelines
never to relinquish the Golan Heights under excuses of
protecting its northern border and valuable water resources.
</P>
<P>
Israeli-Syrian peace talks broke off last March after a
series of Islamic suicide bomb attacks in Israel killed 58
people. Since the hardline Likud government came to power last
June, a military stand-off has been brewing in the border,
fueling fears about a possible war.

<HEADLINE> Debt Relief Yields 93 Million Dollars Saving for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
is likely to save about 93 million U.S. Dollars on its 1996/97
budget, following the cancellation of about 1,000 million Dollars
by the Paris Club last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Acting Finance Minister Daniel Yona told reporters here on
Thursday that the debt relief granted to Tanzania by the club
included the cancellation of the 1,000 million Dollars debt and
rescheduled payment of a 700 million Dollars debt.
</P>
<P>
The minister, however, noted that for the relief to be
meaningful, the government must achieve its 1996/97 fiscal plans
or surpass the revenue collection target.
</P>
<P>
Yona returned from Paris on Wednesday, where he led the
country's delegation for talks with donors of the club.
</P>
<P>
The Paris Club groups Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada,
France, Germany, Italy, Japan, The Netherlands, Norway, Britain
and the U.S.A.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the country's debt to Paris Club member
countries stood at 2,349 million Dollars, out of which 900
million Dollars constituted arrears.
</P>
<P>
He said under terms set by the club only 1,700 million Dollars
were eligible for consideration for relief, out of which 1,000
million Dollars were written off.
</P>
<P>
The club members have also agreed to reschedule repayment of
700 million Dollars for 23 years, including a six-year grace
period, he added.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Needs Fund to Rebuild Cattle Herd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 24 (Xinhua) -- A survey being carried out by
the Cattle Producers Association of Zimbabwe has revealed that
over 16 million u.s. dollars is required to rebuild the depleted
commercial herd.
</P>
<P>
A market report in the latest Commercial Farmers Union's
"Farmer" magazine said as of January 10, 330 farmers had replied
to the survey, indicating they would require at least 16.5
million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Industry experts however said on Thursday the required funding
was a conservative figure as earlier indications had shown that
up to 30 million U.S. Dollars would be needed to buy cows.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's commercial breeding herd now stands at about
450,000 head, excluding breeding cows owned by small-scale
farmers, compared with 650,000 before the devastation 1991/92
drought.
</P>
<P>
Since then, efforts to rebuild the commercial herd have been
hampered by the shortage of cheap finance, forcing many farmers
to sell breeding cows to repay loans incurred during the drought
years.
</P>
<P>
The government, in a bid to help the farmers, has since
approached donors to provide funds to help rebuild the commercial
herd, which would in turn improve the supply of beef to both the
domestic and export markets.
</P>
<P>
Already, the state-owned Cold Storage Company is failing to
fulfill its annual European Union beef export quota of 9,100 tons
due to the shortage of slaughter stock, largely attributed to the
delay in rebuilding the national herd.

<HEADLINE> China Second to Japan in Foreign Exchange Reserves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- China has become the second
largest holder of hard currency reserves, next only to Japan.
</P>
<P>
Latest figures released by the People's Bank of China, the
central bank, show that the country's foreign exchange reserves
grew a record 31.5 billion US dollars in 1996 to 105 billion US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that a trade surplus and a big inflow of overseas
capital are the two major factors behind the rapid growth.
</P>
<P>
China posted a trade surplus of 12.24 billion US dollars last
year, despite a substantial cut in the overall import tariff level
and in export rebates.
</P>
<P>
Overseas capital inflow into China, which consists mainly of
direct foreign investment and international loans, reached 51
billion US dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Experts say they expect China's hard currency reserves to
grow another 10-20 billion US dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
Supported by a rapidly-growing foreign exchange reserve, which
was merely 21.2 billion US dollars at the end of 1993, the Chinese
yuan has consolidated against a basket of hard currencies led by
the US dollar.
</P>
<P>
The yuan edged up nearly 0.3 percent against the greenback in
1996, following a rise of 1.5 percent and 2.9 percent in 1995 and
1994, respectively. It was quoted at 8.2954 against the dollar
today, compared with 8.3174 early last year.

<HEADLINE> China Expanding Onshore Oil Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- China has signed 12 onshore oil
contracts with foreign oil companies in the past year, making
great strides in expanding Sino-foreign onshore oil cooperation.
</P>
<P>
According to the China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC),
China has now signed 30 onshore oil contracts with 35 foreign oil
companies from nine countries and regions, with contracted areas
covering 206,000 square kilometers and total investment amounting
to 770 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation has extended from risk exploration to the
development of oil resources in complex geological structures,
enhancement of oil extraction rates in aging oil fields, as well
as upgrading of oil production technologies.
</P>
<P>
CNPC noted that China will expand onshore oil cooperation this
year by inviting bids for risk exploration, as well as development
of new oil blocks. The corporation's target is the signing of four to
six oil contracts and absorbing 150 million US dollars in foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
CNPC expects the total number of oil contracts to top 20 by end
of this year.

LUSAKA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- A mystery disease killed 18
people within 48 hours while 40 others are admitted to hospital
in Namwala, Southern province of Zambia, the local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
While confirming the outbreak of the disease, Namwala district

a very fast rate because within a day or two someone complains,
one dies.''
</P>
<P>
Area board chairman John Malumbe said that most of the
patients died complaining of chest pains, a disease perhaps
which has something to do with dead rats.
</P>
<P>
Malumbe said, ''in the last two weeks, Namwala District
Hospital has registered 18 deaths resulting from similar
complaints and locals here think it is because of the dead rats
they find in bore-holes and wells where they draw drinking water."

<HEADLINE> Ousted Afghan President in Tehran for Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Ousted Afghan President
Burhaneddin Rabbani arrived here Thursday night to attend the
Afghan Peace Conference which is to start Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that Rabbani's
delegation is made up of senior representatives of the Council for
Defense of the Motherland.
</P>
<P>
Ousted Afghan Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar is accompanying
Rabbani. Almost all Afghan groups, including the Taleban group,
are expected to participate in the conference, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
The conference, titled "Struggle for Peace in Afghanistan,"
will see the gathering of representatives of all Afghan warring
factions as well as those of Pakistan and the United Nations
organization. The conference is sponsored by Iran.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani was quoted by the report as saying that the only way
to solve the Afghan crisis is to come up with a broad based
government.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Alaeddin Boroujerdi said Thursday
night that the response of the Taleban group to the invitation
for the Afghan peace conference in Tehran would test their
claims to peace.
</P>
<P>
Boroujerdi claimed that this is the first time in several
years that senior leaders of all Afghan factions would be
participating.
</P>
<P>
The presence of Rabbani and Hekmatyar at the conference
promises good results for peace in Afghanistan, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said Iran has officially invited the Taleban for the peace
conference, but unfortunately, no response has so far been
received from this group.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan crisis has no military solution, he noted, the
only way out of the present impasse was negotiations between
the different parties and groups in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The fall of Kabul on September 27 is considered as a
major setback in Iran's foreign policy. Iran called the Taleban
as a hand raised group, which has flourished as a result of
U.S. planning, Saudi financial support and Pakistan's logistical
backing.
</P>
<P>
Iran has been supporting the deposed government, which allied
with the faction of northern Uzbek warlord Abdul Rashid Dostam
after losing Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Fighting has continued north of Kabul between the Taleban
and the alliance opposing it, with clashes also reported between
Taleban and its rivals in the northwestern region in the
vicinity of Dostam's base.

<HEADLINE> Disaster Threatens Victoria Falls: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 24 (Xinhua) -- World Conservation Union (IUCN)
regional director Yemi Katerere warned of a pending ecological
disaster at Victoria Falls if the governments of Zimbabwe and
Zambia do not cooperate to protect it from over-development.
</P>
<P>
Addressing 200 delegates attending the two-day Zimbabwe
Council for Tourism Congress in Bulawayo on Thursday, Katerere
said to date there was no common policy on planning and managing
the town's resources on both sides of the border.
</P>
<P>
This had resulted in conflicting land use and management
practices, conservation and tourism development.
</P>
<P>
The prime resort center, which is one of the seven wonders of
the world, straddles the Zambezi river which forms a common
border between Zambia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
''Victoria Falls is a gold mine to both countries so it is
difficult for them to reach a consensus because stakes are
high,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Despite recommendations made by IUCN to the two countries in a
study last year, Katerere said, the governments had not done much
to implement them.
</P>
<P>
The study which said there were currently too many visitors to
the resort town resulting in over-development, which has a
capacity of accommodating 825,000 visitors annually.
</P>
<P>
Katerere warned that lack of coordination between the two
governments in planning and licensing led to the granting of
licenses which did not bear a relationship to the state of the
environment.

<HEADLINE> China Sets Up Third National-level State-owned Oil Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- China has set up its third
national-level state-owned petroleum company, following the China
National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) and the China National
Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC).
</P>
<P>
A ceremony to mark the founding of the company, named China
National Star Petroleum Corporation, was held in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the event, Chinese Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua said
that the establishment of the company shows that "China has taken
a significant step in the reform of the oil industry."
</P>
<P>
The company, with a registered capital of 3.1 billion yuan
(about 373 million US dollars), is formed by eight oil bureaus and
10 research institutes attached to the Ministry of Geology and
Mineral Resources.
</P>
<P>
Over the past four decades, the bureaus and institutes, which
boast a strong contingent of geologists, have discovered a number
of oil and gas fields in China.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the other two national-level state-owned oil companies,
the company will develop both onshore and offshore oil and gas
resources. Moreover, it will focus on the development of gas
resources, said Zhu Jiazhen, president of the company.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that his company will develop gas and oil resources in
East China Sea, in the north part of Jiangsu Province, the west
part of Sichuan Province, the Tarim Basin, the South China Sea,
the Tibet Autonomous Region and other areas.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome all overseas companies to cooperate with us in
developing oil and gas resources," he said, adding that the
company will also explore resources in other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said the company plans to discover 350 to 450 million tons
of oil equivalent in proven and controlled reserves by the end of
century.
</P>
<P>
By 2000, the company's total output of gas and oil is expected
to reach 4.0 to 4.5 million tons of oil equivalent. It will also

<HEADLINE> Tibetans to Face More Employment Opportunities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- With their increased vocational
skills, Tibetans now stand a better chance of getting a job.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, at least 15,000 people in the Tibet Autonomous Region
attended vocational training courses, including classes on
cooking, general office duties, and procedures followed by those
working in state firms.
</P>
<P>
Vocational training centers are widespread in the region,
according to the regional government, which has adopted a series
of special measures, such as tax-free policies in certain fields,
to encourage the opening of such schools.
</P>
<P>
Tibet, traditionally a backward mountainous region, now faces
the challenges of modernization. Power plants and other factories
have been established in the region, which have benefitted the new
generations of the ethnic minority Tibetan groups.
</P>
<P>
Farmers and herdsmen, some of them illiterate, are being urged
by the government to learn about modern industry and technology.
</P>
<P>
Sources with the regional government revealed that in some
regions, vocational schools have vowed to teach any work skill the
students lack.
</P>
<P>
Some officials suggested that, in the long run, every Tibetan
will not only become literate, but also have some knowledge of
technology.

<HEADLINE> Output of Pharmaceutical Industry Up in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The output value of China's
pharmaceutical industry reached 120 billion yuan (14 billion US
dollars) in 1996, up 15 percent from 1995, said an official with
the State Pharmaceutical Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Xiaoyu, director of the bureau, said that his bureau has
improved the operation of the pharmaceutical market, curbed the
practice of trading medicines to accept kickbacks from sales, and
cracked down on production and sales of fake and shoddy medicines.
</P>
<P>
In some areas, drug stores and markets without licenses have
been closed, he said.
</P>
<P>
New laws and regulations on the production and the packaging of
medicine have been formulated. Pharmaceutical companies have
stepped up the reforms in their operations and a large group of
new enterprises have been set up, Zheng said.
</P>
<P>
The pharmaceutical industry implemented the strategy of
development through science and education. The assessment of key
projects of medical science and technology for the 1991-1995
period has promoted the development of the industry as a whole, he
said.
</P>
<P>
But problems such as too many small pharmaceutical factories
and the low production level of the industry still remain to be
solved, said Zheng.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the bureau will focus on the structural
adjustment of the pharmaceutical sector and the rectification of
the market order in the next few years.

<P>
NEW DELHI, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Trade between India and Latin
American countries rose from 480 million US dollars in 1995 to 960
million in 1996, registering a 100 percent growth, the Hindustan

<HEADLINE> U.S. Denies Selling Missiles to Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
denied that it has decided to sell sophisticated air-to-air
missiles to Thailand.
</P>
<P>
However, Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon left open the possibility
that Thailand could one day buy the AIM-120 Advanced Medium Range
Air-to-Air missiles (AMRAAM).
</P>
<P>
"We consider all these things on a case-by-case basis," Bacon
told reporters. "Frequently these discussions continue over a long
period of time."
</P>
<P>
The New York Times today quoted some U.S. officials as saying
that Washington has agreed to sell the missiles to Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper reported that the U.S. and Russia are locked in
"a fierce competition" for arms sales to Southeast Asia, with both
countries offering potential purchasers some of the world's most
sophisticated missiles as incentives.
</P>
<P>
Both countries are trying to "drum up sufficient business to
keep the defense manufacturers profitable and ready to serve the
American military," said the report.
</P>
<P>
"Just a few years ago, the United States would permit the sale
of AMRAAMs only to NATO allies," it adds.
</P>
<P>
Bacon told reporters no one has yet introduced missiles of this
capability into Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
"I think I would just like to stick with our policy, which is
we want to be restrained in our sales so that we don't fuel arms
races. And our policy is not to be the first to introduce new
capabilities into an area," he added.

<HEADLINE> Hubei Province Adopts New Regulation on Poverty Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Hubei Province in central China
has adopted a new regulation to speed up its poverty alleviation
efforts.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said the province is leading the country in
working out such a regulation in accordance with Chinese law.
</P>
<P>
The regulation clarifies the duties and responsibilities of
governments at various levels in saving local poor people from
poverty, and states that poverty-relief funds and projects will be
managed more strictly.
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1980s, the province launched a widespread
poverty-relief program, and the impoverished population has since
dwindled from 7.18 million to 3.05 million.
</P>
<P>
However, the work to reduce poverty in the next several years
will be difficult, local officials said, as most of the poor now
live in remote mountainous areas or places set to be submerged
under reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
Law experts said the regulation is useful in highlighting the
priorities of local poverty relief, and also for promoting work
efficiency among officials and the public.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the Chinese central government initiated a national
program to help the 80 million poor people shake off poverty by
the end of the century. The program is well underway across the
country.
</P>
<P>
Hubei provincial officials say they are working to meet the
goal one or two years ahead of schedule.

<HEADLINE> Air India to Suspend South Africa Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 24 (Xinhua) -- With continuous drop in
business, Air India, along with two other international airlines,
might be forced to stop its South Africa operations, the Hindustan
Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the India's national carrier has already decided to
stop bookings from February 16 in view of slack business, the
newspaper quoted trade sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The other two airlines that are having weak trade are the Gulf
Air and the Ethiopian Airlines. The two airlines have partly
suspended their South Africa operations.
</P>
<P>
Confirming the stoppage of bookings, however, an Air India
spokesperson said this did not mean operations from South Africa
would be withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
He said business was expected to pick-up during the middle of
the year and then during the December holidays.
</P>
<P>
The decision by Air India has come as a big blow to many South
Africans of Indian origin who have supported the airline since it
began operating a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
However, many passengers have also expressed frustration with
the airline's shoddy service both on flight and at ground.

<HEADLINE> China has 100,000 Internet Subscribers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Some 100,000 Chinese people
have become subscribers of the Internet, a senior official with
the Ministry of Electronics Industry said today.
</P>
<P>
According to a national meeting on the electronics industry,
which ends today, about 20,000 Chinese departments are involved in
information services and more than 1,000 databases have been
established across the country.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese capital of Beijing alone has 30 Internet service
outlets, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
China began offering the Internet service to the general public
in June of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Two public networks -- "Chinanet," launched by the Ministry of
Posts and Telecommunications, and the "Golden Bridge Network" set
up by the Ministry of Electronics Industry -- are operating
smoothly.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China has built four special networks including
one controlled by the elite Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Internet is the largest computer network in the world and also
the largest information databank.
</P>
<P>
Some 150 countries and regions, including 40,000-50,000 local
networks and 60 million people, had gone on-line with the Internet
as of early 1996.
</P>
<P>
Industrial giant IBM has predicted that 100 million computers,
100 computer networks and 500 million people will subscribe to
Internet in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Chinese experts said that the hook-up with Internet is one of
the most important steps to push forward the information-oriented
construction of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Internet provides information only in English, so an increasing
number of Chinese departments and network companies have developed
and will start information networks in Chinese, and incorporate
them with Internet through China's six international Internet
outlets.

<P>
The NGOs here claimed that the government has not succeeded in

The NGO Coordination Council (NGOCC), which has over 25 member
organizations, demanded the Health Ministry to have a
representative from the non-governmental sector for a better
coordination between non-governmental and governmental efforts in
family planning, they said.
</P>
<P>
The NGOCC has developed a directory to keep tracks of the
related family planning organizations and held a program recently

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 23 (Xinhua) -- President of the Bosnian
Muslim-Croat Federation Kresimir Zubak today accused Bosnian
Muslim leaders of violating the Dayton accord by interpreting it
according to their own political interests.
</P>
<P>
Zubak made the remark in Zagreb, capital of Croatia. It came
after Federation Prime Minister Edhem Bicakcic, a Muslim, accused
a Croat deputy prime minister of suspected involvement in an
illegal economic deal.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton accord which ended the Bosnian war in 1995,
Bosnia-Herzegovina is split into two semi-autonomous entities, the
Serb Republic and the Croat-Muslim Federation.
</P>
<P>
Muslims and Croats fought each other for 11 months during the
Bosnian war, and in recent weeks tensions between the two have
heightened by their difference on issues like the distribution of
posts in the Federation government, and the establishment of a
Croat autonomous region.
</P>
<P>
Zubak said Muslim leaders' behavior within the Federation
government was the origin of the increasing disputes between the
two sides.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Zubak, who is also the Croat representative of the
three-member Bosnian presidency, was attacked by the Muslims when
he said Muslim leader Alija Izetbegovic was sticking to the idea
of setting up a Muslim country in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the Croats decided to boycott the Federation
assembly (parliament) by withdrawing all their representatives
there.
</P>
<P>
They said they would not accept any assembly resolutions
approved merely by Muslim deputies.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Pushes Ahead Despite Embargo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Cubans have struggled to push
the country's economy ahead despite the United States' blockade of
more than three decades, and the serious hindrance to development
caused by the Helms-Burton Act of last year, authorities say.
</P>
<P>
Cuba's gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 7.8 percent in
1996. Apart from the prosperity of tourism, increases in sugar,
nickel, tobacco exports also contributed to the growth,
Ibrahim Ferradaz, minister of foreign investment and economic
collaboration said.
</P>
<P>
The Helms-Burton Act, imposed last March by the United States
to tighten the economic embargo on Cuba, aimed to penalize any
foreign companies which did business with the country.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the act, commercial or credit operations in Cuba
were temporarily interrupted or delayed, and interests on loans to
the country rose as high as 14 to 20 percent compared with the
general 10 percent. Merchandise transport fees also increased.
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the U.S. blockade for more than 30 years has
lost the island about 60 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
To attract foreign capital, the Cuban authorities, last June,
approved a law for creating tax-free zones and industrial
parks. The National Bureau of Tax-Free Zones was established last
October.
</P>
<P>
New enterprises have continued to be created and foreign
entrepreneurial delegations have arrived continuously. About 40
joint enterprises were established in Cuba in 1996, bringing the
total number of joint ventures to 260.

<HEADLINE> Thai Auto Output up 8.4 Percent in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's auto output rose
despite the economic slowdown last year, with 547,317 vehicles
assembled, up 4.12 percent over 1995.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest statistics by the Federation of Thai
Industries' Automobile Industry Club, the number of passenger cars

<HEADLINE> Dalai's Fabrications About Tibet Refuted  (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As for their accusations of forced sterilization and abortion
in Tibet, the article says, family planning was first introduced
among Han Chinese people in 1975. The policy did not cover urban
Tibetans until 1982, and Tibetans in agricultural and pastoral
areas have never covered by any family planning program, it says.
</P>
<P>
More "bad news" about Tibet created by the prejudiced Western
media is that "the Chinese are pulling down buildings in the
historic old city (Lhasa)," it says, adding that the Dalai Lama
concluded that there is "cultural genocide" in tibet, and that the
tibetans are "living in hell."
</P>
<P>
Records suggest that of the one million people in tibet in 1950
over 900,000 were homeless, and more than 1,000 Lhasa families
relied on begging. The city had a population of only 20,000 at
that time.
</P>
<P>
Today, the article says, rural tibetans have an average of
20.36 square meters of living space, and urban Tibetans 12.59
square meters.
</P>
<P>
It seems that, to Dalai Lama, heaven means tibetans living in
the wilderness and working as poor serfs, the article says.
</P>
<P>
It is true that with rapid economic development tibetans are
refurbishing Lhasa with new buildings, just like Chinese people
are doing in other cities, it says.
</P>
<P>
But the Chinese government and local authorities protect the
cultural and historical relics on the "roof of the world," it
stresses.

<HEADLINE> Dalai's Fabrications about Tibet Refuted  (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By making accusations against China, the ill-minded Dalai and
his followers, including some Western media, are trying to confuse
people with a picture of an old city with cultural relics being
damaged, the article reports.
</P>
<P>
The fact is that Tibet has been paying great attention to the
protection of its local culture and its historical or religious
buildings, it says.
</P>
<P>
The central government has allocated 216 million yuan to repair
the Potala Palace, the Johkang Monastery and many other religious
buildings in recent years, winning wide acclaim from cultural and
religious leaders in tibet, it reports.
</P>
<P>
In providing material to back up the Dalai Lama's attack on
China "pulling down buildings in old cities," his brother Tendzin
Choegyal affirmed that "new commercial buildings and apartment
blocks have gone up" and that tibet is undergoing "remarkable
changes." At least he admits that Tibet is developing at an
impressive pace, the article says.
</P>
<P>
To encourage the development of tibet, the central government
has never taken any tax or revenue from Tibet but has invested 35
billion yuan in the region since 1952. "Ignoring this, Tendzin
Choegyal, in his recent visit to Germany, warned overseas
investors to ensure that funds for reconstruction projects 'do not
fall into Chinese hands'," the article says.
</P>
<P>
Wearing the cloak of religion, the Dalai Lama has served his
Western and Eastern hosts and sponsors by ferociously attacking
the chinese government and spreading rumors about the situation in
tibet the article points out.
</P>
<P>
It concludes that some people live on their hard work while the
Dalai Lama lives on fabricating rumors.

<P>
ROME, January 23 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for the media-retail
group, Fininvest, denied today that the group had ever paid
rackets fees to the Sicilian mafia or received such requests from
the Cosa Nostra.
</P>
<P>
The statement came after Salvatore Cancemi, an ex-mafioso
turned state witness, told a Palermo court that Fininvest
executive Marcello Dell'Utri had paid an annual "fee" of 200
million lire (about 125,000 U.S. dollars) as protection money for
the group's Sicilian TV transmitter, and for downtown Palermo
properties.
</P>
<P>
"Neither Dell'Utri or other executives of the group ever
responded to extortionary requests, nor did they ever receive
demands for protection money," the Fininvest statement said. It
added that the group had no real estate interests in downtown
Palermo.
</P>
<P>
Cancemi testified today in the trial of Vittorio Mangano, a
stable hand who once worked on the estate of Silvio Berlusconi and
who is accused of organized crime ties. Dell'Utri is also on trial
in Palermo for mafia association.

<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian president Leonid
Kuchma paid a one-day official visit to Poland Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma and his Polish counterpart Aleksander Kwasniewski met
and discussed issues on bilateral ties, European integration, the
eastward expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) and regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference after the meeting, Kwasniewski said
that Poland supports Ukraine's efforts for European integration.
</P>
<P>
Poland and Ukraine could play an important role in constructive
cooperation and preventing the possible outbreak of tension in the
central European region, the Polish president noted.
</P>
<P>
He held out hope that when he visits Ukraine this May, the two
countries could sign a joint communique on reconciliation so as to
put an end to the past and pursue a better future.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents also said, for the sake of regional
stability, they would accept a proposal put forward by Belarussian
president Exlexander Lukashenko for holding a tripartite summit
meeting among Ukraine, Poland and Belarus.
</P>
<P>
During Kuchma's visit, Poland and Ukraine signed a memorandum
on measures to be taken that will lead eventually to the removal
of trade barriers between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade reached a record high of 1 billion dollars in
1995. The trade volume in the first nine months last year
increased sharply to 1.4 billion dollars, up 39 percent over the
same period of the previous year.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Thai Currency Hits Six-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The Thai baht hit the lowest
level in almost six years Thursday in a continuous sharp decline
against the U.S. dollar in the past weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank of Thailand, which fixed the mid-rate at 25.79
baht to the dollar, has not intervened, saying that the
depreciation has been strictly a consequence of its use of the
basket of currencies in determining the baht's exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
Each day the bank announces a target rate against the dollar,
with trading allowed around a two-satang (100 satang to the baht)
band in either direction.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Thailand does not reveal the weightings used in the
basket, but analysts believe that the U.S. dollar holds 80
percent, the Japanese yen 12 percent and the German mark 8
percent.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Governor of the Bank of Thailand Chaiyawat Wibulswasdi
denied that a baht devaluation was imminent, saying that the baht
was moving naturally in line with the appreciation of the U.S.
dollar against the yen and mark.
</P>
<P>
The weakening of the baht gives Thai exporters a relative
advantage in the U.S. market, but it is offset by a drop in
competitiveness in their exports to Japan and Germany.

<HEADLINE> Dalai's Fabrications About Tibet Refuted (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- A signed article carried in
today's China Daily, the national English newspaper, refuted
Dalai Lama's fabrications about Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Tibet was frequently in the news last year as the Dalai Lama
continually decried the remarkable economic and social
achievements made in this inalienable region of China, the
article says.
</P>
<P>
"The Dalai Lama seemed to be one of the busiest international
travellers of 1996," it says. He showed up in Denmark, Germany,
Australia and South Africa under all kinds of excuses, trying to
convince the world with his groundless "bad news" about Tibet and
win sympathy from those who know little about the real situation
there, the article says.
</P>
<P>
It says, some countries and interest groups are reluctant to
see an increasingly strong and independent China. They focus on
the Tibet issue in an attempt to realize their own political or
economic interests.
</P>
<P>
"Those people do not care about the facts or the feelings of
people in another country," it says, stating that some biased
Western media have joined the anti-China chorus by promoting the
"bad news" and criticizing the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
The article refuted a recent article published by the Deutch
Press Agency claiming that more than one million out of six
million Tibetans had lost their lives under Chinese rule,
mainly because of torture, execution, starvation, compulsory
sterilization or abortion.
</P>
<P>
However, those people who have some basic knowledge about Tibet
will not be fooled by lies and fabrications, the article says.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey conducted by Beijing University
shows that the population of tibetans in Tibet nearly doubled in
just 42 years, increasing at an average annual rate of 1.6 percent
from 1.15 million in 1952 to 2.23 million in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The 1950 figures provided by Tibet's old government under the
Dalai Lama's rule show that Tibet then had a population of one
million, it says. "I have no idea how the Western media got
the idea that Tibet has a population of six million," says the
article's author, Chen Yali.

BRASILIA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Brazil is planning to become

percent a year.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's oil output has grown by 20 percent during the past two
years and in 1996 it amounted to a daily average of 809,000
barrels.
</P>
<P>
Petrobras, which has the capacity to pump crude from a depth of
more than 1,000 meters in the sea, recently discovered an undersea
oil field with proven reserves of 1.3 billion barrels. This brings
the proven oil reserves of Brazil to 12.3 billion barrels.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 23 (Xinhua) -- A United Nations-sponsored
international meeting on Afghanistan ended today without a unified
program to offer humanitarian assistance to that war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax news agency said more than 300 representatives
from more than 20 countries attended the three-day forum in
Ashgabat, capital of Turkmenistan, and exchanged their views on
the Afghan issue.
</P>
<P>
U.N. special adviser Yasushi Akashi told reporters after the
meeting that he believed that the international community will
eventually draw up a unified program for the humanitarian
assistance to Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
After 17 years of conflicts, Afghanistan is one of the poorest
countries in the world today.
</P>
<P>
The recent escalation of civil war has made even worse the
living conditions of an already impoverished population.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan conflict saw a sudden upsurge as the Taliban militia
launched a lightning offensive last week on the Anti-Taliban
Alliance on the front north of the capital of Kabul.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Major Opposition Party Suffers Another </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' biggest opposition
party, the Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino (Laban), suffered
another revolt as 100 members resigned, local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The reports said Senator Gloria Macapagal Thursday announced to
bolt the party with about 100 party leaders, who were disgruntled
over how Senator Edgardo Angara has been running the party.
</P>
<P>
"I can not, in conscience, remain in the party that stifles
dissent and demands the unthinking obedience of a robot,"
Macapagal was quoted as saying in a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Macapagal, a presidential aspirant, also led the renegades the
same day to form a new party, the kabalikat ng Malayang Pilipino,
which is expected to participate in the 1998 presidential polls.
</P>
<P>
She said she decided to quit the party because the Angara bloc
in the Senate refused to bring her into the new majority that saw
another Laban stalwart, Senator Neptali Gonzales, being ousted
last October as Senate President.
</P>
<P>
Angara masterminded the coup against Gonzales and installed
Senator Ernesto Maceda, president of the Nationalist People's
Coalition, as the new Senate President.
</P>
<P>
"Why couldn't the plotter have chosen another Laban stalwart to
be Senate President? Now I ask you: who is the real renegade in
Laban?" Macapagal said.
</P>
<P>
Angara's coup resulted in an immediate split in the Laban,
sending dozens of senior officials and some 10,000 members to
leave the party. Most of these members defected to the ruling
Lakas-NUCD coalition.
</P>
<P>
Although Angara expressed regret over Macapagal's decision to
quit the party, he accepted it as her right to do so.
</P>
<P>
He added that he was confident that the mass resignation would
not diminish the Laban's standing as the major opposition party in
the country.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Kill 600 Monkeys with Ebola Virus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine environmental
authority has ordered the immediate killing of some 600 monkeys at
a breeding facility in Laguna province, the central Philippines,
to prevent an outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus.
</P>
<P>
Today's Manila Times quoted Environment and Natural Resources
Secretary Victor Ramos as saying that the order was issued after a
six-week investigation by a multisectoral committee showed that
the Ebola Reston Strain continued to infect the monkeys at the
Ferlite farm.
</P>
<P>
"Although there is a remote possibility that it will infect
humans, we will not take the risk," Ramos said, adding that around
600 Philippine macaque monkeys are still at the farm.
</P>
<P>
Ramos also ordered the closure of the Ferlite farm and the
cancellation of its environmental compliance certificate, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The farm was the primate breeding place that exported to the
United States last March two monkeys found to be infected with the
Ebola Reston Strain.
</P>
<P>
The strain took its name from an incident in Reston, Virginia,
the U.S. in 1989 where several Philippine macaque monkeys were
struck by a type of Ebola virus.
</P>
<P>
Ebola, a deadly virus first found in Africa, killed 235 people
in Zaire in 1995 and 13 in Gabon last year.
</P>
<P>
The management of the farm had earlier been given six weeks to
improve its infection control measures to check the spread of the
virus, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
According to findings of the investigation group, the farm
failed to make the required improvement, with an insufficient
supply of "barrier protection materials" such as disinfectants,
masks, gloves and footbaths as well as isolation of animals in the
farm.
</P>
<P>
This prompted the Department of Environment and Natural
Resources to order the killing of all the remaining monkeys by
euthanasia and the incineration of the monkey's carcasses.

BEIJING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- China will buy another US
telecommunications satellite to replace ChinaSat-7, a commercial
telecommunications satellite that failed to enter its preset orbit
last August, said today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
ChinaSat-8, which will be made and launched into orbit by the
US firm, Space Systems/Loral, will incorporate more advanced
functions than ChinaSat-7, noted Cui Xinzheng, a senior official
with the China Telecommunications Broadcast Satellite Corp
(ChinaSat).
</P>
<P>
The deal is one of China's important measures to promote
telecommunications in the next century, Cui said.
</P>
<P>
ChinaSat-8 will be designed to meet not only the demand of the
country's developing public satellite telecommunications in the
near future, but also the needs of other civilian satellite
communications, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Ban Bank Loans To Polluters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The Agricultural Bank will no
longer grant loans to small enterprises with serious pollution
problems, according to a joint notice issued by the State Bureau
of Environmental Protection and the bank.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the decision is to stiffen pollution control in
township and village enterprises and to guarantee the safety of
loans made to them, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
Last September, the State Council ordered a shutdown of small
factories engaged in 15 different pollution-prone industries,
including pulp-making and hide-processing and dye production.
</P>
<P>
The factories include paper mills with an annual production of
less than 5,000 tons, tanneries producing less than 30,000 pieces
of cow leather annually and factories producing less than 500 tons
of dye a year.
</P>
<P>
Officials of local branches of the agricultural bank who grant
loans to the banned factories will be punished, the notice warned.
</P>
<P>
The branches are also required to recover loans given to the
closed-down factories, whose accounts are to be frozen and their
properties sealed for safe-keeping, the notice said.
</P>
<P>
Local branches are also ordered to make reports before February
20 on the checking and recalling of loans which had been granted
to the factories, said today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the notice asked the branches to co-operate with
departments in charge of environmental protection to increase
surveys and checks on borrowers' abilities to prevent and control
pollution.

BUCHAREST, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Romanian police have seized
more than one ton of hashish, worth 15 million U.S. dollars, in
their first major haul of 1997.
</P>
<P>
National television reported today that the hashish was found
in a container of black tea on a ship from South Africa to the
Black Sea port of Constanta, about 200 kilometers east of
Bucharest. The tea was consigned to a company in Bucharest.
</P>
<P>
The police and drug agents are investigating.
</P>
<P>
According to an AP report, the drugs were being smuggled to
Romania from Indochina, but the country from which they originated
was not identified.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian media earlier reported that Romania was becoming a
key staging post for European drug-traffickers. Drugs from the
Middle East, Asia and Latin-America were increasingly being
smuggled to other European countries via Romania.
</P>
<P>
Romanian police had set up an anti-drug directorate and
strengthened cooperation with other European countries to combat
the 'drug invasion'.

MANILA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The following is business news
in brief in the Philippines:
</P>
<P>
-- Scandinavian Motors Corp. (SMC) and Viking Cars Inc. (VCI),
exclusive distributors of Volvo cars in the Philippines, are
projecting 1.5 billion pesos (57.3 million U.S. dollars) in total
sales this year or a total of 750 units, including three new
models up for commercial introduction by the middle of 1997. SMC
Vice President for Legal and Administration Alberto Arcillas said
Thursday that the forecast was based on increased demand for more
luxury cars from the more affluent sectors of the middle-age
bracket. The three new models are the S-40, V-40 and Coupe.
</P>
<P>
-- The Philippine National Bank (PNB) expects its net income to
increase by 30 percent this year to about 2.2 billion pesos (about
84 million U.S. dollars), PNB President Peter Favila said Thursday
in a joint briefing with stock analysts and media. The PNB posted
an unaudited net income of 1.71 billion pesos (65.3 million U.S.
dollars) in 1996, marginally higher than its target of 1.7 billion
pesos (64.9 million U.S. dollars). PNB Senior Executive Vice
President Valentin Araneta said the bank's total resources shot up
by 16 percent to 194.4 billion pesos (7.4 billion U.S. dollars) in
1996 from 167 billion pesos (6.4 billion U.S. dollars) in 1995.

MOSCOW, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Russia will use its new
"cosmodrome", which is located in the Far East Amur region, to
launch a military satellite after the middle of this year, the
Itar-Tass news agency reported here today.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first launch from the Svobodny cosmodrome
(derived from cosmos - the universe), the press officer of the
Russian Military Space Forces said.
</P>
<P>
The launch, which was originally scheduled for September, 1996,
with a United States remote-probe spacecraft as its commercial
payload, had to be postponed until the middle of this year due to
the U.S. experts' delayed preparations, the officer said.
</P>
<P>
The press officer said the launch would be attended by
representatives of companies from the United States, Sweden and
Canada, which were potential customers in future spacecraft
launches from the site.

<HEADLINE> Italy Records Slight Drop in AIDS Cases in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Italy had a slight drop in Aids
cases for the first time in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Epidemiologists from the Aids Center at the Superior Health
Institute noted in a report that up to December 31, 1996, a total
of 37,170 AIDS cases had been reported, 600 fewer new cases than
expected.
</P>
<P>
However, the head of the center, Giovanni Rezza, said it was
not yet clear whether this drop was due to delays in reporting new
cases or to the effects of new therapies used to combat the
disease.
</P>
<P>
According to Rezza, the region most hit was Lombardy, followed
by Lazio, Emilia-Romagna and Liquria -- all having a rate of more
than 12 cases for every 100,000 inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
The Institute also found that the average age at which a person
is diagnosed with Aids had risen over the past ten years, from 29
to 35 for males and from 24 to 33 for females.
</P>
<P>
Children under 12 years of age made up 1.6 percent of the
total. The institute also found that in the paediatric cases,
93.6 percent of the children had contracted the infection from
their mothers.

<P>
BEIJING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- China will seek to renovate the
import and export administration in a bid to create an equally
competitive business environment, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing based English newspaper also said that export
administrative measures will continue to show support for export
products with high added-value, high technology content and famous
brand.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Li Dongsheng, director-general of the foreign
trade administration department of the Ministry of Foreign Trade
and Economic Co-operation, as saying that China will modify the
number of products under import and export quota license to meet
the pace of China's foreign trade development.
</P>
<P>
Li said, there are 143 products under the export quota
administration. The number has decreased sharply from that in the
early 1990s, when more than 200 export items were subject to quota
control.
</P>
<P>
The ministry intends to amend and improve rules guiding the
export quota administration.
</P>
<P>
China will continue to require public bidding on some export
quotas, and in 1997 the practice will involve 33 items, compared
to 30 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The practice is aimed at meeting quotas based on equal
competition and to reduce the practice of some Chinese companies
of cutting export prices to win international market shares.
</P>
<P>
Li added that chambers of commerce are encouraged to play a role
in market co-ordination.
</P>
<P>
Li's department will make an effort to promote the method of
tracing quota licenses, distribution and uses via electronic data
transmission and reinforce the administration over trademarks to
indicate places of original production.

<HEADLINE> Bank Robberies, Hold-ups Decline in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Armed robberies and hold-ups
perpetrated against banks declined by more than half in 1996 in
the Philippines, due to increased vigilance and heightened
security measures jointly taken by banks and the police, the local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
From 20 robberies and hold-ups in 1995, these violent incidents
dropped to nine last year, the reports quoted Governor of the
Philippine Central Bank Gabriel Singson as saying on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Citing a report from the Bankers Association of the Philippines
and the Philippine National Police, Singson said cash losses
dropped to more than 150,000 U.S. dollars last year, from nearly
970,000 dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Singson said the installation of time delay locks in every bank
branch, as mandated by the central bank, greatly helped in the
prevention of armed robberies.
</P>
<P>
Increased police visibility and communication links with police
stations also helped deter hold-ups, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 24 (Xinhua) -- China attaches great
importance to the friendly cooperation with Luxembourg and greatly
appreciates Luxembourg's one-China policy, a senior Chinese
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
China's State Planning Commission Minister, Chen Jinhua, who is
visiting the Grand Duchy, said in an interview with Luxembourg's
Prime Minister, Jean-Claude Juncker, that China and Luxembourg had
great complementarity and a promising future in economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said the two countries should further strengthen their
economic ties, especially in fields like finance and metallurgy.
</P>
<P>
Juncker said the two countries, though having made great
achievements in their economic and trade cooperation, should
further tap potentials.
</P>
<P>
Chen and his entourage will leave for Switzerland Saturday to
attend the annual symposium of the World Economic Forum to be held
in Davos.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Police Arrest Prostitutes And Gamblers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- In their latest crackdown on
pornographic materials and gambling activities, police in the
Chinese capital have arrested 12 people accused of acting as pimps
or of gambling.
</P>
<P>
Police also sent ten prostitutes and customers of brothels for
re-education through labor, and revoked licenses of ten night
clubs that were found to be providing pornographic or gambling
services, authorities announced on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"There are still lots of problems in Beijing's entertainment
spots in spite of the police crackdown on prostitution and
gambling," Zhang Liangji, director of the Beijing Municipal Bureau
of Public Security, pointed out.
</P>
<P>
More than 3,000 cultural and entertainment centers have
appeared recently in Beijing along with the economic growth and
improved standard of living.
</P>
<P>
And "Some businessmen disregard the laws and become involved in
illegal deals in pursuit of exorbitant profits," Zhang said,
noting that the police will continue their efforts to stop illegal
business practices and clean up the culture market.

The Sydney Morning Herald
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Chile Has Unfavorable Balance of Trade in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Chile had a 1.227 billion
U.S. dollar trade deficit in 1996 while in the previous year it
had a 1.385 billion dollar trade surplus, the central bank said
today.
</P>
<P>
The total volume of sales abroad in 1996 shrank by 5 percent,
reaching only 15.296 billion dollars, and that of imports grew by
12.7 percent, amounting to 16.523 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The drastic drop in the international market in the price of
copper and cellulose, the two most important export products of
Chile, contributed to a great degree to the trade deficit, the
bank said.
</P>
<P>
Copper price went down from 133.198 dollar cents a pound in
1995, to 103.894 cents in 1996, a 21.88 percent decline, and
cellulose price dropped from 800 dollars a ton to 500 dollars, a
37.5 percent drop.
</P>
<P>
In imports, the amount of intermediate goods increased by 32
percent, consumer goods 18 percent, and capital goods 14 percent.

<HEADLINE> Dongxing Becomes Convenient Transit Point to Viet Nam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beihai, January 24 (Xinhua)-- Over 5,000 Chinese tourists go to
Viet Nam through the Chinese border city of Dongxing everyday.
</P>
<P>
They choose Dongxing as a transit point not only because it is
a booming trade city, but also because of the simplified and
convenient cross-border formalities it offers.
</P>
<P>
Due to the need to facilitate fast growing trade and tourist
links since the normalization of Sino-Vietnamese relations,
Dongxing has taken measures to shorten the time for handling
cross-border procedures. Now it can arrange a one-day tour
passport to Viet Nam within one hour. It also offers three-day and
one-week tour documents.
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months of 1996, the number of out-bound
Chinese tourists passing Dongxing increased by 88.4 percent as
compared with the same period of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Dongxing ranked number one among the 18 Chinese border
cities in the number of out-bound tourist flows handled.
</P>
<P>
The improved road conditions, including the availability of
expressways and high-grade highways, also contribute to the
booming border tourism of Dongxing, which is conveniently located
600 kilometers away from the tourist city of Guilin, and 170
kilometers away from Beihai at the Beibu Gulf.

<HEADLINE> Italian League Again Fails to Elect President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The Italian Soccer League once
again failed to elect a new president after three unsuccessful
ballots on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
None of the candidates received the two-thirds majority (of 38
votes) necessary to win the presidency. Former Italian Soccer
Federation (FIGC) president Antonio Matarress led the candidates
with as many as 17 votes in three straight ballots, with AC
Bologna president Giuseppe Gazzoni Frascara a close second, and
Mediaset managing director Adriano Galliani third.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of 37 Serie A and Serie B clubs failed to elect
a replacement for former president Luciano Nizzola on January 10.
Clubs deadlocked between Matarrese and Frasoara. Nizzola was
named FIGC president in December.
</P>
<P>
Galliani was named as provisional president at the January
assembly.
</P>
<P>
Following the third unsuccessful ballot, organizers decided to
adjourn the assembly unitl a third meeting at an as yet
undetermined date.

<HEADLINE> WHO Board Meeting Ends Without Accord on Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The executive board of the World
Health Organization (WHO) closed its 99th session here Wednesday
with no agreement on WHO's program budget for the 1998-1999
biennium.
</P>
<P>
"After an extensive debate, members of the board differed on
whether to recommend a 2 percent increase or maintain the level of
budget," said WHO in a press release today. The issue will go to
the 1997 World Health Assembly scheduled to meet in Geneva from
May 5 to 14.
</P>
<P>
The WHO board singled out five priority areas for the program
budget: promotion of primary health care and other related areas;
eradication of specific communicable diseases; prevention and
control of other communicable diseases; and reproductive health,
women's health and family health.
</P>
<P>
The 10-day meeting also discussed the issue of WHO reforms to
improve WHO's effectiveness and efficiency in responding to the
changing needs of member states.
</P>
<P>
The board members examined the renewal of the health-for-all
strategy. Five principles were emphasized during the discussion:
human-centered sustainable development, health policies based on
sound evidence, the "gender perspective," the primary health care
approach and partnerships.
</P>
<P>
One of the resolutions adopted at the meeting requested WHO
Director-General Hiroshi Nakajima "to coordinate the observance of
World Tuberculosis Day on March 24 of each year as an opportunity
throughout the world for organizations concerned to raise public
awareness of tuberculosis as a major urgent public health problem
and for countries to assess progress in tuberculosis control."

<HEADLINE> Stocks Tumble on Wall Street </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 23 (Xinhua) -- New York stocks plunged this
afternoon in heavy trading, as a jump in interest rates triggered
profit-taking, pulling the Dow Jones industrial average down from
its first piercing through 6,900.
</P>
<P>
The Dow, up more than 56 points shortly after 2 p.m., slid to a
loss of nearly 108 points before steadying and finishing with a
drop of 94.28, or about 1.4 percent, to 6,755.75. Despite the
drop, the Dow has still advanced about 4.8 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-4 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with its volume jumping to 683.80
million shares, an all-time high.
</P>
<P>
Broader measures also fell sharply after spending most of the
session at record levels.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list fell 8.67, or 1.1 percent,
to close at 777.56, erasing an 8.44-point afternoon gain.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index fell 9.71 to 1,378.35 after
surpassing the 1,400 mark for the first time.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE composite index fell 3.65 to 409.15, and the American
Stock Exchange composite index fell 1.18 to 589.69.
</P>
<P>
The Dow had rallied in earlier trading as a series of
impressive earnings reports. But the momentum died as bonds turned
lower, boosting the interest rates, as the market absorbed a new
supply of securities from a government auction of 12.5 billion
U.S. dollars in new 5-year Treasury notes.
</P>
<P>
Analysts noted that the financial markets' recent jitters have
been aggravated by fears that the stream of robust profit reports
has enhanced suspicions that the economy may be accelerating at an
inflationary pace.
</P>
<P>
As bonds fell, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond rose to
6.85 percent from late Wednesday's 6.83 percent.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon: US Considers START III After Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the United States
and Russia have been seeking further arms reduction between the
two giant military powers, but the U.S. side holds that Russia
should ratify the START II treaty first, a senior U.S. Defense
Department official said today.
</P>
<P>
Defense Department spokesman Keneth Bacon told a news briefing
that U.S. President Bill Clinton and Russian President Boris
Yeltsin and other leaders of the two countries have discussed for
several times the possibility of further reduction of nuclear arms
after the two nations signed the Second Strategic Arms Reduction
Treaty (START II) in 1993.
</P>
<P>
He said that the United States was willing to begin
negotiations on a START III agreement after START II was ratified.
</P>
<P>
"Since... President Clinton and President Yeltsin have talked
about the possibility of moving toward a START III agreement after
START II is ratified, the Pentagon has been looking at what
further force reductions would be possible, would be acceptable,"
Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that the U.S. position has not changed, that
is, the Russian Duma (parliament) must ratify START II first.
</P>
<P>
However, the Russian Duma has yet voted on the treaty because
many Russian legislators were upset by NATO's plan to expand
eastward to include some of the former Warsaw Pact member nations.
</P>
<P>
Moscow has also been balking at the accord on grounds that it
will cost too much to implement and will impel the Russian
government to build additional strategic weapons to maintain rough
parity with the United States at the ceiling the treaty sets.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post reported today that the Pentagon is
secretly studying the impact of an additional cut of 1, 000 to
1,500 nuclear warheads to leave residual forces of as few as 2,000
weapons.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials see that a proposal for new cuts as a way to
persuade Russian legislators to ratify the so-called START II
treaty, which calls for 50 percent cuts in nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
But Bacon said, "we've made it very clear to the Russians on a
number of occasions and at a number of levels that START II is the
step that has to be got to START III negotiations."

<HEADLINE> France Salutes UN Nomination of Special Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 23 (Xinhua) -- France today saluted and
expressed its full support for the nomination by the United
Nations of Algerian Mohammed Sahnoun as the special representative
of the U.N. and the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to the
Great Lakes region of Africa.
</P>
<P>
Sahnoun, 65, worked for the U.N. in Somalia in 1992 and in
Congo in 1993. He clashed with the then U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali over the U.N. policy in Somalia before
resigning from the post of U.N. envoy in the eastern African
state.
</P>
<P>
"We salute the designation of Mr. Sahnoun as special and
common representative of the U.N. and OAU for the region of Great
Lakes. The nomination of this prominent diplomat is a very
important step which we have been waiting with impatience," said
French Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt.
</P>
<P>
He said that Sahnoun can fully count on the support of France
for his mission.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope that the step will be followed by
the holding of an international conference on peace, security and
development of the Great Lakes region and international support
for the holding of elections in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
"What is important is the future of Zaire and the whole region.
We expect Mr. Sahnoun and the special envoy of the European Union
(EU) for the Great Lakes region of central Africa, Aldo Ajello, to
work with close liaison," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the common efforts to be made by the U.N.,
OAU and EU will "authorize reasonable hopes of peace for this
roughly tested region."

<HEADLINE> US to Seek UN Action Against Libya Over Landing Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration
said today that it would seek action against Libya at the United
Nations for its airliner landing in Accra, capital of Ghana.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said at a briefing,
"We believe an effort may be under way to test the U.S.
resolutions. We will pursue the matter at the United Nations."
</P>
<P>
He was referring to a Tripoli airliner which was permitted by
Ghana to land in Accra earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
The United States has said that Libya was behind the 1988
bombing of Pan Am 103 over Scotland and has made the United
Nations place sanctions against Libya, including a measure that
forbids international landing rights to Libya's national airline.
</P>
<P>
Ghanian officials reportedly said that they granted the landing
rights to the Tripoli airliner after the pilot said he was out
of fuel and would crash in 25 minutes.
</P>
<P>
But the United States would not believe the remarks.

<P>
NEW YORK, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar hit a 47-month
high of nearly 120 yen and touched another 2-year high against the
mark today before retreating to end mixed in New York.
</P>
<P>
The dollar was once traded as high as 119.69 yen, the strongest
since February 1993, before settling at 119.47 yen, up from 119.03
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A late sell-off in the U.S. stock market also helped check the
rise of the dollar. The Dow Jones industrial average, which
surpassed 6,900 in the afternoon for the first time, tumbled
nearly 100 points in the final hour of trading.
</P>
<P>
The strong dollar indicated the currency remained in heavy
demand. Traders predicted it would test the 120-yen level and
probably keep rising against the Deutsche mark.
</P>
<P>
The dollar dropped to 1.6366 mark in New York today, down from
1.6427 Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The British pound, which tumbled Wednesday to the lowest level
since October, weakened further in a broad retreat sparked partly
by fears that the governing Conservative Party may have to call
parliamentary elections in March instead of May.
</P>
<P>
In New York the pound cost 1.6292 U.S. dollars, down from
1.6300 U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Former Nazi Collaborator to Face Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Maurice Papon, former Gaullist
minister and secretary general of the prefecture of Gironde from
1942 to 1944, has become the second Frenchman to face trial over
charge of complicity in crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
After the French supreme court rejected today an appeal by the
86-year-old former Nazi collaborator, Papon lost the last chance
to escape justice for deporting some 2,000 Jews to Nazi death
camps during World War II.
</P>
<P>
He will be summoned by the Investigation Court of Gironde over
charges of complicity in crimes against humanity, and become the
second man after another Nazi collaborator, Paul Touvier, to be
tried over such crimes.
</P>
<P>
The Criminal Chamber of the Cour de Cassation (supreme court),
presided by Judge Christian le Gunehec, rejected five arguments by
the attorney of defense of Papon, who appealed against a decision
by the Bordeaux Appeals Court made in September 1996 to put him on
trial.
</P>
<P>
Attorney Varaut, the defending lawyer of Papon, argued that the
procedure of the case has lasted too long (15 years) and that
Papon was impossible to be an accomplice of the Nazis because he
did not believe in Nazi ideology and because he did not belong to
a criminal group.
</P>
<P>
The court said that the Nuremberg Court which put on trial Nazi
criminals in the wake of World War II did not say that a Nazi
accomplice must believe in Nazi ideology or must join the Nazi
party.
</P>
<P>
Papon himself made an outcry after the court made the decision,
saying that he was being persecuted like Captain Dreyfus, a Jewish
officer of the French army who was wrongly jailed in the late 19th
century for allegedly spying for the Germans.
</P>
<P>
The court decision was welcomed by all civil groups, including
the National Federation of Deportees and Jailed Resistant Fighters
and Patriots, and the Union of Jewish Students of France.
</P>
<P>
The decision also brought to an end a 15-year-old dispute over
the case, which was triggered by the publication in 1981 of some
documents of the Vichy collaboration regime, which was signed by
Papon for the rounding up and deportation of thousands of Jews to
Germany.
</P>
<P>
After France was liberated from Nazi occupation in 1944, Papon
served several prefect's seats and as Paris police commissioner
under the government of President Charles de Gaulle, and was
minister of budget under the government of Prime Minister Raymond
Barre in the 1970s.

<HEADLINE> US Complains of Saudi Over Bombing Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The United States has
complained against Saudi Arabia for withholding information about
its investigation of a truck bombing there that killed 19 American
servicemen last year.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Janet Reno told a news conference today that
Saudi Arabia has failed to turn over "some very important
information" about the June bombing at a U.S. military housing
complex in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, which she said was needed "to
assess what action should be taken."
</P>
<P>
"I am hopeful that we will be able to address these issues
(and) obtain the information so appropriate steps can be taken,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
Her remarks followed a similar criticism from FBI chief Louis
Freeh, who spoke at a Wednesday lunch with the Washington Post's
editors and reporters.
</P>
<P>
"We have not gotten everything which we have asked for, and
sure, that has affected our ability to make findings or
conclusions, or to channel the investigation in different
directions," today's Washington Post quoted Freeh as saying.
</P>
<P>
At a State Department briefing, spokesman Nicholas Burns said
of Reno and Freeh, "They both spoke for the U.S. government."
</P>
<P>
At the Pentagon, spokesman Kenneth Bacon said U.S. views "have
been expressed very clearly by the director of the FBI."
</P>
<P>
The Saudi embassy had no immediate response to the U.S.
criticism.

The department said that the December surplus totaled 19.4
billion dollars, nearly four times the 5.3 billion surplus a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
Boosted by quarterly tax payments, U.S. government revenues
totaled 148.5 billion dollars in the month, compared with 99.7
billion in October and 97.8 billion in November.
</P>
<P>
Spending in December totaled 129.1 billion, down from 140
billion in October and 135.7 billion in November.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. government was 58.8 billion dollars in the
red during the October-December period, 5.4 percent more than the
deficit during the same three months of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has projected that the deficit in
the current year, starting from October 1 of 1996, would rise to
125.7 billion dollars from 107.3 billion last year because of
spending increases on entitlements such as Social Security and
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government budget deficit hit a record 290.4 billion
dollars in fiscal 1992, and then dropped in each of the following
years. The deficit in fiscal 1996 was the smallest since 79.0
billion in fiscal 1981.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government debt currently stands at 5.2 trillion
dollars resulted from each year's budget deficit.

<HEADLINE> US Exempts Sudan in Doing Business with US Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration
has exempted Sudan from the 1996 Antiterrorism Act that restricts
U.S. companies from financial transactions with countries
blacklisted by the United States, according to a report in the
Washington Post today.
</P>
<P>
By exempting Sudan, the U.S. government cleared the way for
Occidental Petroleum Corp. to negotiate a part in a 930 million
U.S. dollar oil deal for a field in southern Sudan that could
contain an estimated 3.5 billion barrels.
</P>
<P>
Occidental reportedly donated more than 600,000 dollars to
political parties in the past two years, with donations split
evenly between Democrats and Republicans.
</P>
<P>
Occidental officials had no comment on the exemption.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Envoy: Regional Plan for Refugee Solution in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Carrol Faubert, special envoy
of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for the former
Yugoslavia, said here today that the regional plan on permanent
solutions for refugees from the region was expected in March.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, he said the last meeting of the
commissioner for refugees in Serbia, Montenegro, Croatia and the
two entities in Bosnia would be held in Belgrade on February 17,
and after that a regional plan was expected to be adopted by the
UNHCR on permanent solutions for refugees from the former Yugoslav
republics.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 2 million refugees or displaced persons
caused by the ex-Yugoslav crisis that started in 1991. About
700,000 have sought asylum in countries outside the former
Yugoslavia, more than 600,000 have been housed in the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia and around 1 million stay in Bosnia. Only
200,000 refugees have managed to return home since peace was
established a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Faubert, who arrived here Tuesday on a several-day visit, said
he talked with Yugoslav officials about how to accelerate the
process of return of refugees, and about possibilities of local
integration.
</P>
<P>
"We assess as positive the possibility given to refugees to
submit a demand for Yugoslav citizenship," he said.
</P>
<P>
Many refugees in Yugoslavia, fearing possible prejudice or new
conflicts, would rather stay where they are and integrate into the
local community than go back to the place of their origin in
Croatia or Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Faubert said the UNHCR considered the best solution for
refugees would be that all former Yugoslav republics made
provisions to grant dual citizenship to the refugees.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the problem of refugee repatriation to Croatia
and Bosnia-Herzegovina, Faubert said he believed the key factor
was "the readiness of political leaders to accept decisions of all
agreements signed so far, from Dayton to the Erdut agreement."
</P>
<P>
"The process of transition in the territory of Eastern Slavonia
is a good example and I think we should not be doubtful about its
success," Faubert said.

<HEADLINE> Albright Sworn In as Secretary of State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Madeleine Albright was sworn
in today as secretary of state by taking the oath of office from
Vice President Al gore at the White House.
</P>
<P>
The first female secretary of state ever in U.S. history was
confirmed to take the post by a Senate voting 99-0 Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At the swearing-in ceremony, Albright promised to help lead the
United States in playing a leadership role in world affairs,
somewhat like a world policeman, even though the Clinton
administration had never acknowledged the role.
</P>
<P>
"If we are complacent or timid or unwilling to look beyond our
borders, our citizens will not prosper, and the framework of
American leadership and the foundation of American security we
have built could crumble with 21st century speed," she said.
</P>
<P>
Albright, a Czechoslovak-born daughter of a Czech envoy who
fled to the United States in 1948, had served as Clinton's U.N.
ambassador since 1993.

<HEADLINE> Unconditional Cooperation With Int'l Tribunal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 23 (Xinhua) -- U.N.
Under-Secretary-General for Legal Affairs Hans Correll has said
that it is the position of the United Nations that unconditional
cooperation with the International Tribunal is imperative.
</P>
<P>
He has also said that Republika Srpska should surrender Dr.
Radovan Karadzic and General Ratco Mladic as well as all other
accused within that entity to the International Tribunal to stand
trial.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks Wednesday in response to a letter from the
president of the Serb Repubic, which argued that Dr. Karadzic and
General Mladic should not be subject to the jurisdiction of the
International Tribunal.
</P>
<P>
Correl said that the tribunal, as the representative to the
international community as a whole, was a guarantee of an
independent, impartial and fair trial for all accused individuals.
</P>
<P>
"The Stature of the International Tribunal and the Rules of
Procedure and Evidence, by which it is bound, are an expression of
the highest standards of human rights and due process of law, and
a built-in guarantee for the rights of the accused," he said.

<HEADLINE> Iran Warns Against U.S. Military Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani said here today that Iran will powerfully respond to
any possible U.S. military measure and reveal to the world the
real power of Iran.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a gathering of Iranian press officials, Rafsanjani
said that the United States has harbored deep malice toward Iran
following the victory of the Islamic revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani made it clear that regional security was indivisible
from Iran's security and that Iran plays a fundamental role in
safeguarding regional security.
</P>
<P>
Without doubt, he noted, lack of security in Iran means
insecurity in the whole region, and in such a case the U.S. will
not feel any rest.
</P>
<P>
It is unlikely that the U.S. would dare any aggression against
Iran, he concluded.
</P>
<P>
Then, Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati claimed that
the situation in the Persian Gulf is rather "tense" and "unsafe"
due to foreign military presence, especially the United States.
</P>
<P>
Velayati called the military presence of foreign powers
"unprecedented in the world" and serves as "obstacle to economic
development in this part of the world."
</P>
<P>
"Such a tense and endangering environment would weaken the
spirit of independence and initiative and instead prevail the
balance of fear, doubt and suspicion in the region," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Some Western media reports have said that Washington is working
out a special military program to strike 19 Iranian targets,
including some military training camps and nuclear reactors.
</P>
<P>
The keys to defuse the dangerous situation, the Iranian foreign
minister said, are regional cooperation, bilateral dialog and
trust-building measures.

<HEADLINE> PNA Renews Warning Against Israeli Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 23 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official
today renewed warning against the grave consequences of the
Israeli policy on the Jewish settlements and Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting this afternoon with African ambassadors to
Egypt, Saeb Erekat, minister of Local Government of the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA), said that the Israeli policy
on settlement expansion on the Palestinian lands and
non-withdrawal from Jerusalem hinders the peace process and could
blow it up.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has recently warned
of "severe consequences" if a Palestinian state is established
and vowed to keep Jerusalem as Israel's "sole and undivided
capital."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's rejection of the establishment of the Palestinian
state contradicts with the declaration of principles signed by
Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization in Oslo, Norway
in 1993, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want to establish their own independent state
with East Jerusalem as its capital when the interim agreements
are completed by May 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Hebron issue was among 34 outstanding issues that need to
be settled, including the agreement on the safe corridor between
Gaza and the West Bank, the opening of the Gaza Airport and
harbor, taxes and financial transactions, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Israel has not abided by its commitments, and negotiations
will start in this respect," he added.
</P>
<P>
Though the road ahead is still long and rough, the Hebron deal
and negotiations will be an example to be followed in tackling
other issues, especially after the U.S. has provided guarantee to
the Israeli-Palestinian agreements, he said.
</P>
<P>
The entire issue of Jewish settlements will be discussed during
the final phase talks, due to start in mid-March, in conformity
with the Hebron protocol, added the PNA official.
</P>
<P>
Erekat called upon the African countries to continue their
support to the Palestinian people until the independent state is
established.
</P>
<P>
He met afterwards with the ambassadors of Latin America in the
Embassy of Argentina in Egypt to expound the dimensions of the
Hebron agreement and the perils facing the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Erekat came here on a two-day visit Wednesday, while PNA
President Yasser Arafat made a several hours' trip here the same
day on his first visit to Egypt since the handover of most of
Hebron to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving here, Arafat said that he was soliciting
Egyptian and Arab support for the next stage of
Israeli-Palestinian talks.
</P>
<P>
The PNA now controls the Gaza Strip and eight West Bank towns
handed over by Israel under several agreements signed since
1993. It will control 99 percent of the West Bank after completion
of the third phase of Israeli troop redeployment in the first half
of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The issue of the final status of these areas, which Israel
captured in the 1967 Mideast War, together with other sensitive
problems such as Jerusalem, refugees and the Palestinian
statehood, is to be determined in the talks which should end no
later than May 1999.

<HEADLINE> Key Issues of Georgian Peace Process Remain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 23 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said today that the key issues of the Georgian peace
process, such as the future political status of Abkhazia and the
return of refugees and displaced persons, remain unresolved.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the Security Council concerning the situation in
Abkhazia, Georgia, the secretary-general recommended that the
Security Council extend the mandate of the United Nations Observer
Mission in Georgia, stating that both sides had recently
reaffirmed their desire for a political solution.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the desirability of a political solution has also
been underlined in the increasingly frequent direct contacts
between the two parties, the secretary-general appealed to both
sides to intensify the search for a peaceful solution by further
expanding their bilateral contacts.
