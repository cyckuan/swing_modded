Police detain two Chinese dissidents, seize articles
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Police detained two democracy campaigners and
seized articles and address books from their homes in southeast
China before releasing them, human rights groups reported Tuesday.
	   Police questioned Lin Xinshu and Chen Yibin _ Lin for 13 hours
and Chen for 9 _ on Monday about their democracy work and contacts
inside and outside China, the groups said.
	   Lin was released late Monday placed under a form of house
arrest. He may not leave his home in Fuzhou city without permission
from authorities, New York-based Human Rights in China said.
	   For Lin, the brief detention was his second in two months. Last
time, he drew police attention after signing a petition demanding
freedom for jailed democracy campaigners. His detention this time
followed an open letter to Chinese leaders on Friday calling for
democratic reforms.
	   The police actions come amid one of the most sustained
clampdowns on dissent in years. Dissidents in several provinces
have been detained for trying to form a labor rights group and an
opposition party to challenge Communist Party rule.
	   In Lin's case, police took the unusual step of questioning his
sister, Lin Xinwei, and searching her home on Monday, Human Rights
in China said.
	   Fuzhou city's police chief signed the search warrant for Lin's
home, the group said. Police took books, drafts of essays,
articles, address books and other literature from Lin's and Chen's
homes, the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and
Democratic Movement in China reported.
	   Police also have refused to release labor rights activist Zhang
Shanguang, even though his one-month detention order expired
Friday.
	   Under police orders, Zhang's wife, He Xuezhu, went to get him
last Friday. But when she arrived at the Huaihua city detention
center in southern Hunan province, police told her no one was
available to sign the release order, the Information Center and
Wuhan-based dissident Qin Yongmin said.

No homers for McGwire or Sosa; Cubs routed by Astros
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS and UPDATES with late games &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PITTSBURGH (AP) _ Mark McGwire took the day off, and, as it
turned out, the St. Louis Cardinals and Pittsburgh Pirates did, too
_ at least in the standings.
	   The Cardinals-Pirates game was rained out in the middle of the
seventh inning Monday afternoon with the score tied 5-5. The result
goes down as a tie, and all statistics count.
	   The game will be made up when the Pirates play at St. Louis from
Sept. 14-16.
 &UR; Astros 12, Cubs 3
	   In Chicago, Sammy Sosa was 2-for-4 with a pair of singles,
remaining at 51 homers. Moises Alou, Craig Biggio and Carl Everett
homered for Houston, which completed a three-game sweep, outscoring
Chicago 33-9.
	   Alou's homer was his 38th of the season and ninth in 18 games.
Biggio had 17 homers, including four during the series. Everett was
2-for-5 with five RBIs, matching his career high.
	   Shane Reynolds (16-8) retired 12 straight after a nearly 2-hour
rain delay in the bottom of the second. He gave up one run _
unearned _ and four hits in six innings, striking out seven and
walking none. Mark Clark (7-12) was the loser.
 &UR; Giants 7, Marlins 4
	   In Miami, Joe Carter rallied San Francisco from a 4-3 deficit
when he hit a two-run homer in the eighth off Brian Edmonson (3-4),
and the Giants swept an opponent for the first time.
	   San Francisco finished 9-0 against the Marlins, outscoring them
61-29. The Giants' best previous one-season record was 15-1 against
the Boston Braves in 1918.
	   Rich Rodriguez (4-0) pitched 1 2-3 scoreless inning for the
victory, and former-Marlin Robb Nen pitched a hitless ninth for his
33rd save.
 &UR; Braves 4, Dodgers 3
	   In Atlanta, Javy Lopez and Andruw Jones hit back-to-back homers
in the eighth against Jeff Shaw (2-6) as Atlanta overcame a 3-0
deficit.
	   The Dodgers broke a scoreless duel between Tom Glavine and Brian
Bohanon in the top of the eighth when Trenedad Hubbard scored from
first on Gary Sheffield's single. Eric Karros followed with his
third homer in two days.
	   Tom Glavine (17-5) joined teammate Greg Maddux as the NL's only
17-game winners, allowing 10 hits in eight innings. Kerry
Ligtenberg pitched a scoreless ninth for his 23rd save.
 &UR; Reds 8, Expos 1
	   In Montreal, Pete Harnisch took a perfect game into the sixth
inning and wound up with a three-hitter as the Cincinnati completed
a three-game sweep, extending the Expos' losing streak to five.
	   Harnisch (10-6), who struck out nine and walked one, allowed a
one-out homer to Orlando Cabrera in the sixth, an infield single to
Vladimir Guerrero in the seventh and a two-out single to Ryan
McGuire in the eighth.
	   Dustin Hermanson (11-10), who had won his previous four
decisions, allowed five runs and six hits in seven innings.
 &UR; Diamondbacks 9, Mets 5
	   In New York, Jay Bell doubled, tripled and homered as Arizona
tripped up the Mets for the second straight day. New York remained
one game ahead of Chicago in the wild-card race.
	   With the Mets trailing 4-1 in the ninth, Mel Rojas allowed five
runs and three hits, including a three-run homer by Matt Williams
and a solo shot by Kelly Stinnett.
	   Bell, 3-for-4 with three RBIs, tripled in the first, doubled in
the third and homered in the fifth off Masato Yoshii (5-7), who
lost for the sixth time in seven decisions. Amaury Telemaco (5-8),
who had lost five of his previous six starts, gave up one run and
five hits in seven innings, and Willie Blair got five outs for his
first save.
 &UR; Rockies 3, Phillies 1 &QC; 
	   In Philadelphia, Todd Helton homered and Bobby Jones snapped a
three-game losing streak with six strong innings as the Rockies
defeated the Phillies.
	   Jones (6-7) surrendered five hits en route to his first win
since August 3 at Pittsburgh. The left-hander walked three and
struck out six before getting relief help. Dave Veres finished up,
getting the last two outs for his fifth save.
	   Helton continued his torrid hitting as the Rockies took two of
three games in the series and finished 5-4 against Phillies for the
season. The rookie first baseman has batted safely in 36 of his
last 44 games (57-for-162, .351) with nine homers and 32 RBIs.
 &UR; Padres 7, Brewers 2 &QC; 
	   In Milwaukee, Greg Vaughn hit his 43rd home run and Ken Caminiti
homered and drove in four runs to lead the Padres over the Brewers.
	   Sterling Hitchcock (8-5) allowed eight hits in eight innings,
striking out five and walking two.
	   Steve Woodard (9-9) was tagged for five runs and nine hits in
six innings, losing his fourth straight decision.
	   San Diego scored twice in the sixth on Vaughn's homer and Greg
Myers' RBI single to take a 3-2 lead.

Mariners edge White Sox 11-10

<TEXT>
	   SEATTLE (AP) _ Ken Griffey Jr. hit his AL-leading 44th home run
Monday as the Seattle Mariners completed a four-game sweep of the
Chicago White Sox with a 11-10 victory.
	   Seattle, which led 9-1 in the fifth, allowed Chicago to close to
9-6 in the eighth. After consecutive run-scoring wild pitches by
Jaime Navarro in the bottom half, Robin Ventura hit in 10th career
grand slam in the ninth.
	   Griffey, who also had an RBI double, is showing signs of
snapping out of his prolonged power drought, which saw him hit only
home run in 87 at-bats before Sunday.
	   Ken Cloude (8-9) allowed three runs and four hits in seven
innings, and Timlin got his 12th save. Mike Sirotka (12-12) gave up
eight runs and eight hits in 3 2-3 innings.
 &UR; Angels 7, Yankees 3 &QC; 
	   In New York, Garrett Anderson tied the score with a two-run
homer in the seventh and Gary DiSarcina hit a go-ahead, two-run
double later in the inning to lead Anaheim over New York.
	   Anaheim, which could play the Yankees in the first round of the
playoffs, holds a 4-3 advantage over New York this year _ the only
team the Yankees don't lead in the season. The Angels maintained a
2{-game lead over Texas in the AL West.
	   New York (94-34), trying to become the first team to win 100
games before September, has lost consecutive games twice within six
days after not losing back-to-back games for a month.
	   Jack McDowell (3-2) won his second straight start since coming
off the disabled list.
 &UR; Rangers 6, Tigers 5 &QC; 
	   In Arlington, Texas, Aaron Sele earned his 15th victory and Will
Clark hit a two-run homer as the Rangers entered a favorable
stretch of the schedule with a victory over the Tigers.
	   The Rangers fell out of first place in the AL West when they won
only seven of 17 games during an 18-day run that ended Sunday night
against three of the AL's elite: the New York Yankees, Boston Red
Sox and Cleveland Indians.
	   Starting with Monday night's game against the Tigers, the
Rangers' next 18 games are against five sub-.500 clubs: Detroit,
the Chicago White Sox, Minnesota, Kansas City and Tampa Bay.
 &UR; Royals 7, Blue Jays 3 &QC; 
	   In Toronto, rookie Brian Barber bounced back from a disastrous
start and Sal Fasano homered as the Royals beat the Blue Jays to
win their season-high fifth straight game.
	   After allowing eight earned runs in just 1 2-3 innings against
Boston in his last start, his first major league appearance since
1996, Barber (1-1) held the Blue Jays to one earned run on three
hits before leaving with one out in the seventh.
	   Matt Whisenant pitched the final 1 1-3 innings for his second
save.
	   Fasano, who homered and had a career-high four hits on Sunday,
gave the Royals a 2-1 lead in the fourth with his eighth home run.

Wreckage of missing plane found
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ Rescuers on Tuesday located the wreckage
of a small plane missing since Friday in a mountainous region in
midwestern Nepal but there was no word on its 15 passengers, the
state-run Radio Nepal said.
	   The aircraft was located by a Nepalese Army helicopter that had
been combing the area for the missing DHC-6 plane, manufactured by
DeHavilland of Canada. Rescuers have not been able yet to reach the
crash site.
	   The plane had crashed at an altitude of 12,000 feet (3,636
meters) just 11 kilometers (7 miles) west of Mount Annapurna, the
8,091 meters (26,700 feet) high Himalayan peak.
	   The Lumbini Airlines Twin-Ottor aircraft with 15 passengers and
three crew members had lost radio contact with the control tower
five minutes after takeoff on Friday from Jomsom, located 200
kilometers (125 miles) northwest of Katmandu, the Nepalese capital.
	   The passengers included 12 Nepalese and three Indians.
	   Thick fog, deteriorating weather in the past two days and
mountainous terrain had hampered rescue efforts forcing helicopters
to cancel search flights. Mountain guides assisting the rescue had
to retreat to the base.

Dalai Lama urges Taiwan to resolve strays problem
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ In the latest international appeal to help
resolve Taiwan's chronic stray dog problem, the Dalai Lama has
urged lawmakers to pass a pending animal protection law.
	   ``I have recently learned of the appalling conditions suffered
by dogs in Taiwan,'' the Tibetan Buddhist leader said in a letter
to Taiwan's legislature.
	   ``I wish to join the appeal to the Taiwanese government to
respond positively to the international call for change,'' he said.
	   The legislature's secretariat said the general secretary,
speaker, and vice speaker had all received copies of the letter,
and the long-delayed legislation is on the agenda for passage in
the coming session.
	   The popularity of dogs as pets and loose or nonexistent controls
on sale and registration of the animals have created a population
of strays in Taiwan estimated at up to 2 million.
	   Captured strays often die of neglect in overcrowded shelters or
are killed by drowning or electrocution, treatment that has
attracted condemnation for humanitarian and animal rights groups
worldwide.
	   The Dalai Lama is widely revered in Taiwan, where most people
practice a combination of Buddhism and traditional Chinese
religion.

Indonesians protest outside foreign ministry against U.S. strikes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A small group of demonstrators shouted
``Clinton is evil'' in a protest Tuesday against the U.S. missile
strikes in Sudan and Afghanistan.
	   Fifty protesters outside the foreign ministry said the attacks
ordered by U.S. President Bill Clinton were an assault on Islam.
Indonesia is the world's most populous Muslim country.
	   The United States attacked alleged terrorist sites last week in
retaliation for the Aug. 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania in which some 270 people were killed.
	   Student demonstrator Irfan Budiman said Clinton was trying to
distract attention from the scandal surrounding his affair with
Monica Lewinsky, a former White House intern.
	   The protesters held up banners that read ``U.S.A., you have
violated the territory of Islam'' and ``Long live Islam, America go
to hell.''
	   They met with a foreign ministry official to demand that
Indonesia send a note of protest to the United Nations, and then
marched to the U.S. Embassy. Anti-U.S. demonstrators also rallied
at the embassy on Monday.
	   At a news conference Tuesday, Foreign Minister Ali Alatas
condemned the bombings of the U.S. embassies. President B.J.
Habibie has said the U.S. retaliation was not an assault on Islam.

Thai shrimp exporters expect drop in volume
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai shrimp exporters aren't expecting
to meet export forecasts this year because of declining demand and
a glut on the world market, the Bangkok Post reported Tuesday.
	   Thailand is the world's largest shrimp exporter, but industry
experts are warning that unless production costs are lowered, Thai
shrimps may become less competitive in price, the paper said.
	   Thailand exported 137,000 tons of shrimp worth 47 billion baht
(dlrs 1.14 billion) in 1997, the Thai Frozen Foods Association
said.
	   The association had forecast exports of 60 billion baht (dlrs
1.46 billion) this year, but now says it doesn't expect to meet
that target, the paper said.
	   It attributed the fall off to declining demand, especially in
Japan and China. The United States is Thailand's largest market for
shrimp, accounting for 50 percent of all shrimp exports.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Veteran fullback Michael York will
captain a young Australian team in the Commonwealth Games field
hockey tournament next month.
	   Head coach Terry Walsh and fellow selectors today named a 16-man

home a medal from the World Cup in Holland in May and the average
age has dropped from 26.7 years to 24.5.
	   Those to drop out since the World Cup were axed Atlanta
Olympians Paul Lewis, Lachlan Elmer, Lachlan Dreher and Baeden
Choppy and veteran centre half David Wansbrough, who has retired.
	   Squad: Michael York (captain), Jay Stacy (vice-captain), Michael
Brennan, Adam Commens, Stephen Davies, Damon Diletti, Jason Duff,

Australian official tips record haul in KL
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian Commonwealth Games
secretary-treasurer Arthur Tunstall believes the team is set for a
record gold medal haul in Kuala Lumpur next month.
	   Australia set the record with 87 four years ago in Victoria,
Canada.
	   Tunstall, who was in charge of the 1994 team, predicted
Australia would win 85 gold medals at those games and was accused
of putting too much pressure on the team.
	   ``I would expect at least to equal the 87 gold medals we won in
Victoria, and possibly exceed that figure,'' Tunstall said Tuesday.
``For Kuala Lumpur the Australian team will be the largest ever
sent overseas for any Games _ a total of 444 athletes and
officials.
	   ``As well, the Games program includes new sports in one-day
cricket, seven-a-side rugby, hockey and netball.''
	   The games open on Sept. 11 and close 10 days later.
	   Tunstall, who was the center of attention in Victoria after
comments about disabled athletes, will be in KL as vice-president
of the Commonwealth Games Federation.
	   He described the Australian team's quarters at the games village
as ``100 percent''.

China braces for renewed flooding on Yangtze River
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Lead expected after government news conference scheduled for
0700 GMT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's exhausted flood fighters were ordered to
remain on guard as a new surge of high water barrelled down the
Yangtze River on Tuesday, threatening to overwhelm dikes weakened
by a summer of devastating floods.
	   ``Persevere and persevere again to win the climatic battle in
the fight against floods,'' the Communist Party newspaper People's
Daily exhorted.
	   The new Yangtze flood crest, the seventh so far in a summer of
flooding that has seen thousands killed and millions made homeless,
was expected to put added pressure on vital dikes that protect
cities and farmland.
	   Revised figures on deaths and damage from the flooding were
expected at a government news conference scheduled for later
Tuesday. At the last news conference nearly three weeks ago, the
government revised the death toll sharply upwards to more than
2,000 people killed nationwide.
	   It also said that the floods have affected 240 million people, a
fifth of the population, to varying degrees. Much of the damage and
dislocation has been along the Yangtze, now seeing its heaviest
flooding in 44 years.
	   Water levels along one crucial stretch on the Yangtze's middle
reaches were rising as the new flood crest surged through the
renowned Three Gorges, the China Daily said.
	   While the flood crest was not expected to reach the highs of
those that preceded it, flood fighters were told to prepare.
	   Hubei, a central province among the most badly flooded, was
concentrating troops along dikes that threatened to give way, the
People's Daily said. Officials ordered that lighting and telephones
be set up along endangered dikes and stocks of sand, stone and
sacks for sandbags be prepared, the newspaper reported.
	   Nearly 20,000 medical teams with 130,000 people were working in
flood-hit areas to prevent the spread of diseases and distribute
medicines.
	   Manufacturers of life jackets, bottled drinking water, medicines
and fast food were asked to work overtime to provide supplies for
flood victims, the official Xinhua News Agency said.
	   Meanwhile, the government worked to prevent the misuse or theft
of relief funds and donations. Hubei's government fired officials
who embezzled 2,000 yuan (dlrs 240) or more in relief money, Xinhua
said.

Thousands of Cambodians protest election fraud

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Keeping up the pressure on Cambodian
leader Hun Sen, 3,000 anti-government protesters gathered Tuesday
in front of the National Assembly calling for his ouster.
	   It was the third protest against Cambodia's strongman in as many
days.
	   Crowds blocked roads and crammed inside a small park in front of
the National Assembly, where 100 people spent Monday night in an
around-the-clock vigil to protest alleged fraud in last month's
general election.
	   The park was the site of a grenade attack against a labor
protest led by opposition politician Sam Rainsy in March 1997.
Seventeen people died and more than 100 were wounded in the attack,
which Sam Rainsy blamed on Hun Sen.
	   Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party won 64 of the 122 seats in
the National Assembly in the July 26 poll, short of the two thirds
majority needed to form a government.
	   Opposition parties have accused the CPP of perpetrating
widespread fraud in the balloting and counting process and have
said they will boycott any attempts by Hun Sen to form a ruling
coalition.
	   The crowd exploded on Tuesday when Prince Norodom Ranariddh,
president of the leading opposition Funcinpec party, arrived to
greet them for the first time. He returned from Bangkok, where he
had spent the last 10 days, on Monday afternoon
	   ``Hun Sen said he is (a man) of the people,'' Ranariddh shouted
toward the sea of faces from the top of a pickup truck. ``He should
listen to the people and step down.''
	   The crowd erupted at the call for Hun Sen's resignation.
	   Hun Sen ousted Ranariddh as his co-prime minister in a violent
coup d'etat in July 1997. As many as 100 of his loyalists were
killed in the months that followed.
	   Hun Sen called for new elections to win back legitimacy and aid
lost after his violent takeover.
	   The prince warned Tuesday that Hun Sen's time in power is
running out.
	   The mandate of the current National Assembly expires Sept. 24,
he said, proposing that the king intervene and a caretaker
government be formed until a new election can be organized.
	   ``On July 26 the people did not vote for Hun Sen but for
democrats,'' the prince shouted to the crowd, wiping sweat from his
forehead. ``We are not going anywhere. We will stay here to demand
justice.''
	   The 100 protesters staging the round-the-clock vigil have set up
blue tarp tents and covered the grass with straw mats. They are
refusing to leave until allegation of election fraud are
investigated.
	   More than dlrs 3,000 in donations have been collected from
supporters, market vendors, cyclo drivers and students to keep the
vigil going.
	   Sam Rainsy said if there are any efforts by police to remove the
protesters by force they will peacefully resist, lying limply on
the ground.
	   Interior Ministry officials said Tuesday they have not decided
yet how to handle the protesters.

Report: Singapore, Indonesia conduct joint military exercise
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore and Indonesia are conducting a major
military exercise despite their economic difficulties and recent
tense relations, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   The drills are taking place in Indonesia's Riau Province, just
south of neighboring Singapore, and mark the first such exercises
since a change of leadership in Jakarta three months ago, according
to The Straits Times.
	   The operations include fighter aircraft in combat simulations, a
helicopter search and rescue mission, and re-supply exercises by
transport planes, the daily said.
	   Singapore's armed forces will also distribute humanitarian aid
to villages in the region.
	   The air drills are the tenth in a series between the two
countries, and serve as ``a means to enhance relations'' in
general, Singapore's Colonel Voon Tse Chow was quoted as saying.
	   Ties have soured recently between the Southeast Asian neighbors.
	   Attacks on ethnic Chinese during the May riots have troubled
many Singaporeans, most of whom are ethnic Chinese.
	   In addition, Indonesian President B.J. Habibie has said that
Singapore is not doing enough to help his ailing nation, which is
in the grips of an economic catastrophe.
	   Tiny Singapore, less severely affected by the Asian crisis
though damaged nonetheless, has said it will help its huge neighbor
if it can. But it has warned that resources are limited.
	   ``After all, we are only 3 million people. Just a little red dot
on the map. Where is the capacity to help 211 million people,''
Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong asked in reference to
Indonesia during his annual state-of-the-nation address Sunday.

East Timor students demonstrate for referendum on independence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) - About 700 pro-independence activists
protested Tuesday in East Timor against the Indonesian government's
offer of autonomy for the disputed territory.
	   Students and other demonstrators also demanded that the military
pull more troops out of the former Portuguese colony, which was
invaded by Indonesia in 1975 and annexed a year later.
	   The protest was held on a soccer field in Bobonaro, 165
kilometers (100 miles) west of the provincial capital of Dili.
	   Demonstrators said they wanted a referendum on independence in
the territory of 800,000 people, a demand that Indonesian President
B.J. Habibie has ruled out. He has proposed a measure of autonomy
but wants to maintain Indonesian authority.
	   On Aug. 5, Portugal and Indonesia agreed to discuss granting
East Timor autonomy after two days of talks brokered by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   Annan described the deal as ``progress,'' but said it was not a
major breakthrough.
	   Indonesia is implementing democratic reforms in the wake of the
ouster of autocratic President Suharto in May, and withdrew 1,000
soldiers from East Timor as a goodwill gesture.
	   However, 11,000 soldiers remain here, where a small band of
separatist guerrillas operates.

Thai police detain 14 Myanmar protesters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai immigration police have detained
14 Myanmar students protesting in front of their embassy in
Bangkok. But a Foreign Ministry spokesman said Tuesday they have
not been arrested and won't be charged with breaking the law.
	   ``A number of leaders have been brought in by the immigration
police, but they are not being charged with any crime,'' said
Kobsak Chutikul, a Foreign Ministry spokesman.
	   ``The authorities are urging them to either call off their
hunger strike or relocate their group across the street so they
will not interfere with the work of the Myanmar Embassy,'' he said.
	   About a hundred Myanmar students and pro-democracy activists
have been demonstrating in front of the embassy for more than two
weeks, and 18 of them entered the fourth day of a hunger strike on
Monday.
	   ``My will is still very strong,'' said Kay Mar Soe, 21, whose
husband was detained three days ago by police. ``We are committed
to our cause and will continue to carry out our campaign until our
demands are met.''
	   The students want the military government of Myanmar, also known
as Burma, to allow a parliament elected in 1990 to convene. The
military, which has ruled Burma since 1962, has refused.
	   The Thai government has asked the students to move their protest
across the street from the embassy, but the students have so far
not complied.
	   Students said the Thai police had been arresting members of
their group as they stepped away from the protest site to go the
bathroom or get food.
	   ``The Thai police have been employing dirty tactics by snatching
the demonstrators away when they step outside,'' said Win Thein.
	   ``We refuse to move from this site even if it means arrest. We
have agreed among ourselves that we will not back down,'' he said.
	   Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai voiced support for the protesters
over the weekend, saying that Thailand, as a democratic country,
allowed such demonstrations.
	   He cautioned them, however, not to break Thai laws.
	   Kobsak urged the protesters not to resist Thai government calls
for them to move across the street from the embassy, saying that
any confrontation with the police could swing public and government
sentiment against them.
	   ``The Thai public, as well as certain segments within the Thai
government are sympathetic to their cause, but problems in Myanmar
will not be solved here in Bangkok,'' he said.
	   ``We ask for their understanding that there are certain
guidelines we have to abide by. Even Thai protesters also have to
stay across the street when protesting at the parliament,'' Kobsak
said.

	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Despite an American attack last week that
wrecked Sudan's largest pharmaceutical plant, troubled relations
between the two countries that soured almost a decade ago will soon
become better, Sudan's parliament speaker says.
	   The remarks by Hassan Turabi, the man considered the real power
behind the Islamic government, stand in sharp contrast to several
days of rallies and protests in Khartoum, where demonstrators have
denounced the United States and President Bill Clinton in
particular.
	   ``I still believe that we hit the bottom and that we will rise.
I think so, I think so. That's not only a wish,'' told The
Associated Press on Monday. ``I don't think it will take too
long.''
	   The United States launched a missile attack Thursday on El Shifa
Pharmaceutical Industries Co. on the outskirts of Khartoum,
destroying the plant's three factories. Washington has said the
plant, which provided at least one-third of Sudan's domestic drug
market, was manufacturing precursors for VX nerve gas.
	   The attack culminated years of deteriorating relations with
Sudan's government, which took power in a military coup in 1989
that overthrew a democratically elected government.
	   Soon after, the United States cut all but humanitarian aid. It
later added Sudan to its list of countries supporting terrorism,
imposed trade sanctions and withdrew its diplomats from the
capital.
	   But Turabi said he believed U.S. policy, which he described as
pragmatic, would see the benefits of better ties. Sudan is Africa's
largest country, and Turabi said its economy would soon prosper by
virtue of its fertile land, abundant water and natural resources.
	   ``It's not just another country to disregard, and it's not a
hostile enemy to Christians, to Americans,'' he said.
	   But, in somewhat contradictory tones, he promised that the U.S.
attack on the factory would not be easily dismissed.
	   ``All the Sudanese now actually see the United States,
generally, as the incarnation of the devil, of evil,'' Turabi said
in the interview at his home, decorated with framed Koranic verses
and a picture of the Kaaba, Islam's holiest shrine.
	   He called the attack ``most criminal, most savage'' and, like
other Sudanese leaders, he accused Clinton of launching the strike
to divert attention from scandals at home.
	   ``He was haunted with attacks against his matrimonial loyalty
and credibility and, besides that, even his credibility vis-a-vis
the nation, in courts, in Congress,'' Turabi said.
	   Turabi, an urbane lawyer with degrees from universities in
Britain and France, is a renowned survivor. He has been a fixture
of Sudanese politics since 1965, holding posts under five regimes.
	   Over a generation, his cadres in the National Islamic Front
infiltrated the bureaucracy, army, unions and banks, finally
seizing control with the military in 1989 in the only revolution to
bring an Islamic government to power in the Arab world.
	   To his supporters, he is a savvy political and religious leader,
creating a bold experiment in Islamic rule.
	   But his detractors, both at home and abroad, accuse him of
organizing a pervasive and ruthless police state and supporting
Islamic militants, either by providing refuge or setting up
training camps. He called the charges ``absolute sheer nonsense.''
	   One militant who took refuge in Sudan was Osama bin Laden, the
exiled Saudi millionaire the United States accused of orchestrating
the bombings of American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. In Sudan,
his company built a road from the capital and an airport.
	   Bin Laden left Sudan in 1996 for Afghanistan, where he fought
Soviet troops in the 1980s. His departure from Sudan was by choice,
according to Turabi, who defended him as a hero.
	   ``Anyone who resists power or persecution, if you like him you
call him resistance, a freedom fighter, a revolutionary,'' said
Turabi, dressed in a white robe and turban. ``It's only when you
don't like him you use another language, that he's a terrorist.''
	   Turabi said he did not believe bin Laden had a role in the
embassy bombings, attacks that he said he understood.
	   ``There may be people who feel, `What can they do?''' Turabi
said. ``It would be an understandable act, not a justified one.''
	   Turabi defended Sudan's right to have chemical weapons, but said
it had neither the intention nor the means to acquire them.
	   ``What do we need chemical weapons for?'' he asked.

Supporters of Indonesian pro-democracy leader battle police
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - Police fired tear gas Tuesday at
stone-throwing supporters of a pro-democracy leader who tried to
disrupt a congress held by a rival party faction.
	   Four police officers were injured in the incident involving
followers of opposition figure Megawati Sukarnoputri in the
Sulawesi island city of Palu, police and witnesses said.
	   Megawati was ousted as head of the minority Indonesian
Democratic Party in a military-sponsored party congress in June
1996, when Indonesia was led by former President Suharto. The
autocratic leader quit in May amid riots and student protests.
	   The government-backed candidate who replaced Megawati, Soerjadi,
opened a congress this week in Palu to pick a new leader of the
party, known as PDI.
	   However, about 1,000 Megawati backers converged on the building
where the congress was being held, claiming that Soerjadi had been
illegally installed as chief of the party. Fighting broke out.
	   On Aug. 19, the Supreme Court threw out a lawsuit by Megawati in
which she alleged that breakaway PDI leaders and government
officials plotted her ouster.
	   Megawati is the eldest daughter of Sukarno, Indonesia's founding
president. She is seen as a strong candidate for president in
general elections scheduled next year.
	   In May, President B.J. Habibie took over from Suharto, pledging
democratic reforms in the nation of 202 million.
	   Megawati was ousted as PDI leader because of her consistent call
for greater democracy in the country, which was ruled with an iron
hand by Suharto for three decades.
	   Her ouster triggered riots in Jakarta on July 27, 1996,
following the storming of the party's headquarters by police and
Soerjadi's supporters.
	   At least five people were killed and more than a dozen are still
missing from the rioting.

Howard declines to name poll date, as election speculation grows
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Amid heightened speculation,
Australian Prime Minister John Howard Tuesday refused to say
whether he was about to call national elections.
	   ``I don't know when the election is going to be, I haven't made
up my mind,'' Howard said in a radio interview.
	   ``The only weekend I have ruled out is the last weekend in
September, because that's when you have the two football grand
finals.''
	   Australia's two most popular brands of football _ Australian
rules and rugby league _ will hold their grand final matches on the
same weekend, Sept. 26-27.
	   Conventional political wisdom holds that Australian voters react
angrily to governments which interrupt their sports-watching by
requiring them to make a visit to the voting booths.
	   Asked if he would be available for a golf game on the weekends
of Oct. 3, 10 or 17, he said: ``Well, can I check? I have received
a few dinner invitations for the night of the 17th of October,
largely from interviewers.''
	   Observers have nominated October as the most likely month for
elections if they are to be held this year. Howard can wait until
next year, but elections must be held by May 1999.
	   Because the constitution requires at least 33 days notice be
given, elections held on Oct. 3 must be called this weekend.
	   The release of Howard's plan to overhaul Australia's tax system,
which includes large personal income tax cuts, and the start of an
Australian dollars 10 million (U.S. dlrs 5.9 million) advertising
campaign to sell the plan to voters, have helped prompt speculation
an election announcement was imminent.
	   The Australian Financial Review newspaper Tuesday reported the
national capital Canberra had gone into ``election red alert,''
with government ministers and departments told to clear the decks
of normal business by the end of this week.
	   Howard's Liberal party had established its campaign headquarters
in a Melbourne office block, the newspaper reported.
	   Howard said suggestions the elections will be in October are
``hypothetical.''
	   Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer on Tuesday said the government
did not need Parliament to sit next week, as is scheduled, to pass
legislation relating to the sale of the nation's wool stockpile.
	   If the election is called, Parliament will not sit again until
after the poll.
	   Asked by reporters whether he was ready to go to elections,
Fischer said: ``Absolutely, but it is a matter for the prime
minister.''

Sales fall at Japan's three biggest carmakers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Hurt by an economic slump at home and elsewhere in
Asia, Japan's three largest automakers said Tuesday domestic sales
and exports fell markedly in July from a year earlier.
	   Toyota Motor Corp., the nation's largest carmaker, said domestic
sales declined 6.6 percent to 174,628 cars in July from the same
month last year. Exports of Japanese-made cars overseas dropped 8.8
percent to 128,721.
	   At No. 2 carmaker Nissan Motor Co., sales in Japan fell 9.3
percent to 95,078 automobiles, and exports were down 3.1 percent to
67,077.
	   Honda Motor Co. said sales in the home market tumbled 9.8
percent to 58,767 cars. Exports, which make up a large part of the
company's sales, dropped 13.3 percent to 41,086.
	   On a more upbeat note, Honda said production of cars outside
Japan jumped 12.2 percent in July to 97,000, and Toyota said its
overseas production rose by 8.9 percent to 125,329 cars.
	   Nissan said overseas production fell 18.9 percent to 73,217.

In a month of shuttle diplomacy, Castro casts spell over the

Caribbean &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ In an extraordinary
month of Caribbean diplomacy, Fidel Castro found audiences eager
for his views on the need for regional unity and the dangers of
capitalism.
	   Whether his message plays elsewhere is another matter.
	   In a whirlwind tour of Jamaica, Barbados and Grenada three weeks
ago, Castro, now 72, overcame nearly four decades of U.S.-driven
diplomatic isolation that stemmed from opposition to his Marxist
government.
	   His Soviet backers long gone, Caribbean democracies no longer
perceive Castro as a threat. Their embrace of him reflects
frustration with U.S. trade policy, which threatens their banana
exports to Europe and thousands of textile jobs at home.
	   Castro followed up that tour with his first visit to the
Dominican Republic in his 39 years as Cuba's leader. Here, he won
accolades at a 16-nation Caribbean summit and wooed Dominicans who
remember his opposition to the late dictator Rafael Trujillo.
	   ``The Dominican people are grateful to Castro. He tried to help
us overthrow the tyrant Trujillo,'' said Max Puig, a Dominican
historian and trade negotiator.
	   In a farewell speech Monday lasting more than five hours, Castro
alluded to his own mortality, to those who would kill him, and to
critics hoping his revolution will crumble the moment he leaves the
scene.
	   It won't, he proclaimed.
	   ``Men die. Peoples are immortal,'' said Castro, subject of
frequent speculation about his health and rumored assassination
plots by his enemies abroad.
	   Castro said capitalism is dangerously dependent on speculation
that places both developing countries and economic giants at risk.
	   Already, the seeds of a global collapse akin to the 1930s
depression have been sown, Castro told a partisan audience of
academics, university students and leftist activists.
	   Southeast Asia's financial crisis, he said, has extended to
Russia and is beginning to engulf Latin America. ``Even they (the
United States) are suffering the consequences,'' he insisted.
	   Castro's appeal Monday for a brand of global socialism committed
to improving the lot of developing nations and preventing U.S.
``cultural imperialism'' played well with his listeners.
	   ``Capitalism can't be the only prism through which we view
society,'' said Lourdes Contreras, a political activist.
	   There were few local protests to Castro's Caribbean visits,
despite a reminder earlier this month from the State Department of
Castro's poor record on human rights.
	   Shunning the U.S. embargo of Cuba, Caribbean leaders say they
have adopted a ``constructive engagement'' approach to encourage
Castro to loosen his grip on dissidents.
	   But while democracy was on the agenda at the Caribbean summit,
no explicit mention of Cuba's human rights situation was made in
Castro's presence, acknowledged Edwin Carrington, secretary-general
of the Caribbean Community bloc.

	   ARKALYK, Kazakstan (AP) _ Three Russian cosmonauts landed in the
Kazak desert on Tuesday after a flawless descent from the Mir space
station.
	   The Soyuz TM-27 spacecraft touched down at 9:23 a.m. Moscow time
(0523 GMT) near the town of Arkalyk in north-central Kazakstan. It
carried crew commander Talgat Musabayev and his colleague Nikolai
Budarin, who spent 207 days on board the Mir, and former
presidential advisor Yuri Baturin, who spent 12 days there
performing scientific experiments.
	   ``The landing spot is good, smooth, there is a swift east wind
blowing and the weather is fair, Musabayev was quoted as saying by
the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Cosmonauts Gennady Padalko and Sergei Avdeyev, who traveled to
the Mir with Baturin, remain aboard the space station and are
scheduled to return to Earth in February.

Near miss reported between Japanese airliner, U.S. military jet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese aviation authorities said Tuesday they are
investigating a reported near miss between a Japanese commercial
airliner and a U.S. military jet in skies near Tokyo.
	   The pilot of a Japan Airlines DC-10 reported an anti-collision
system kicked in last Wednesday over to avoid a possible crash,
said Masanobu Tokumaru, a safety inspection officer at the
Transport Ministry.
	   Tokumaru said the U.S. military in Japan notified the ministry
that an American F-18 jet was flying nearby at the time. He said
Japanese aviation officials are investigating whether a near miss
occurred.
	   The JAL flight was ascending at an altitude of about 5,800
meters (19,024 feet), when its pilot discovered the military jet
flying below from right to left at 7:25 a.m. (2225 GMT) Wednesday
morning, Tokumaru said.
	   The two planes were flying at different altitudes about 160
meters (525 feet) apart over Sagami city, located about 40
kilometers (25 miles), west of Tokyo, Tokumaru quoted the Japanese
pilot as reporting to the ministry Monday.
	   None of the 147 passengers and 10 crew members aboard the DC-10,
which was en route to Hiroshima from Tokyo's Haneda airport, were
injured, Tokumaru said.
	   Japanese civilian pilots have frequently complained of problems
with the flight routes of U.S. military aircraft, and want more
limitations on their flight paths and tighter restrictions on the
type of training missions they can conduct.
	   U.S. military planes are exempt from Japanese domestic rules
that require Japanese warplanes to conduct low-altitude training
away from civil aviation routes and limit them to a narrow corridor
when flying over land.
	   It is also legal for American planes to train at very low
altitudes over populated areas and fly without following
instructions from commercial control towers.
	   There are currently about 47,000 U.S. military personnel
stationed in Japan under mutual security arrangements between the
two countries.

Dollar lower on intervention fears, Tokyo stocks rebound
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing stocks, mid-afternoon bond and currency;
ADDS comments by trader in 9th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar slipped against the yen Tuesday on
persistent fears of intervention by Japanese monetary authorities.
Tokyo stocks rebounded back above the psychologically-important
15,000-point level.
	   The dollar bought 144.27 yen as of mid-afternoon, down 0.13 yen
from late Monday in Tokyo but above its late New York rate of
143.95 yen overnight.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
rose 84.57 points, or 0.56 percent, to close at 15,072.93. On
Monday, the average lost 309.84 points, or 2.03 percent.
	   The yen gained after overseas investors dumped dollars for the
Japanese currency following comments by Japanese officials such as
Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, who warned Tuesday morning that
Japan would intervene to prop up the yen.
	   ``We won't hesitate to intervene if moves are such that they
disrupt the workings of the market economy,'' Miyazawa told a
regular press conference.
	   ``The market's caution against intervention is extremely
strong,'' said Yoneo Sakai, general manager of the international
treasury division at Fuji Bank Ltd. in Tokyo.
	   Other traders said U.S. hedge funds were selling dollars for yen
to book profits to offset losses incurred from investment in Russia
and other emerging markets.
	   Still, traders said gains could be capped by concerns about the
fate of a series of banking-reform bills that the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party will put before Parliament Tuesday. Opposition
parties are resisting the use of public money to bail out ailing
banks.
	   ``It looks like the dollar-yen will seesaw around the 143-yen
level for a while,'' said Koichi Kubo, assistant manager of
international foreign exchange at Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, prices rebounded following Monday's
steep decline, when the Nikkei 225 average closed below 15,000 for
the first time in a week.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 4.28 points, or 0.37 percent, to 1,162.58. The
TOPIX closed down 18.21 points, or 1.55 percent, the day before.
	   Prices gained following the overnight rise on Wall Street, where
the Dow Jones industrial average rose 32.96 points _ or 0.4 percent
_ to 8,566.61.
	   Traders said they were heartened by the Dow's resilience despite
the ambiguity that still clouds Russia's future.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 1.130 percent from Monday's close of 1.135 percent.
Its price rose to 112.23 yen from Monday's 112.19 yen.

</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with British Airways confirmation; quotes and details
of deal &QL; 
 &UR; By DIRK BEVERIDGE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ In a move certain to rattle the Boeing Co.,
British Airways said Tuesday it will order its first batch of jets
from Europe's Airbus Industrie.
	   Airbus called a news conference for early Tuesday afternoon with
British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Airbus President Noel
Forgeard at its headquarters in Toulouse, France, to unveil details
of the plan.
	   British Airways plans to buy 59 short-haul jets in the A320
family, with options to buy another 129, according to a British
Airways statement released Tuesday morning.
	   Despite the partial defection to Airbus, British Airways still
plans to fly lots of Boeings, keeping the Seattle-based company as
its supplier for larger jets. It will buy 16 Boeing 777s, with
options for 16 more.
	   The list price of the new aircraft BA is ordering comes to 3
billion pounds (dlrs 5 billion), although the company did not
disclose the exact price it is paying.
	   ``We have ordered the right aircraft at the right time at the
right price,'' said BA chief executive Bob Ayling. ``This is a
great investment in our fuuture, made possible by the commercial
success of British Airways.''
	   Whatever the amounts, the deal is a commercial victory and a
huge psychological score for Airbus, the consortium made up of
aerospace companies from Britain, France, Spain and Germany.
	   While most European airlines have bought from Airbus, British
Airways has long been one of Boeing's most loyal customers.
	   ``We are delighted to be in a position to order Airbus aircraft
for the first time, while remaining Boeing's biggest customer
outside the U.S.A.,'' Ayling said.
	   The big British airline has never purchased any airplanes
directly from Airbus, although it now has 10 in its fleet that came
with the acquisition of a smaller airline several years ago.
	   British Airways announced in February that it would be buying a
new batch of short-haul jets to replace airplanes now flown from
its bases in Manchester, Birmingham and London Gatwick, as well as
for its French and German subsidiaries, Air Liberte and Deutsche
BA.
	   British Airways plans to rearrange its mix of large Boeing jets,
using slightly smaller versions on some long-haul routes, according
to an industry source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   British Airways now flies to dozens of cities all over the world
using Boeing 747 jumbo jets, but in the future it will shift more
services to smaller jets such as the Boeing 777, the source said.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Armed assailants took 10 people hostage in a
village in the North Caucasus region of Russia and killed one of
the hostages, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported Tuesday.
	   The two abductors seized 10 people living in Elkhotovo, a
village in the North Ossetia region, on Monday night, ITAR-Tass
said. Two of the hostages escaped, and one was killed after trying
to resist abduction.
	   Police have launched a search. They have not yet established a
motive for the hostage-taking, ITAR-Tass said.

Reports: Japan's arsenic curry poisonings not first case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ In a possible lead in the probe of fatal poisonings
in western Japan, police have found two men who suffered similar
poisoning in the same area before the killings, news reports said
Tuesday.
	   The two men fell ill after visiting the home of an acquaintance
near the site of the fatal poisonings in Wakayama, a small coastal
city 453 kilometers (283 miles) southwest of Tokyo, the reports
said.
	   Asahi newspaper and Kyodo News agency, quoting unidentified
police sources, said investigators found traces of arsenic in one
of the men. Both of them survived, though one was still
hospitalized.
	   Wakayama prefectural police refused to comment on the reports.
	   The case could establish a link with the fatal poisonings, in
which four people _ including two children _ died at a community
festival in July after eating curry contaminated with arsenic.
	   The curry poisonings, which also sickened dozens, were major
news in Japan, where memories are still fresh of the 1995 nerve gas
attack on the Tokyo subways that killed 12 people.
	   The poisoning forced the cancellation of similar annual
festivals and prompted a clampdown on chemical supplies. Police
have made little progress, though, in finding the killer.
	   The two men involved in the earlier poisoning were treated
separately at a hospital for nausea after visiting the
acquaintance's home, the reports said. Police suspect they became
ill after consuming something at the house.
	   Both men frequently visited the acquaintance's home, the sources
said.
	   Tests in a Tokyo crime laboratory reportedly have shown that the
three pots of curry in the July 25 poisoning case contained more
than 100 grams (3.5 ounces) of arsenic _ enough to kill more than
500 people.

Indonesian foreign minister says government will continue riot
</HEADLINE>
probe

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The government will press ahead with
efforts to find culprits in the May riots in Jakarta that left as
many as 1,200 people dead, a Cabinet minister said Tuesday.
	   ``We should not cover up any facts,'' Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas said.
	   Indonesia's image has been sullied by the rioting, in which
looters targeted ethnic Chinese and the military was slow to
respond to much of the unrest. Anti-Indonesian protests have been
held in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, the Philippines, the United
States and elsewhere.
	   Thousands of Chinese-owned homes, stores and buildings were
burned and looted in the violence which led to the resignation of
autocratic President Suharto.
	   Women's rights groups have alleged that at least 168 women and
girls, mainly from Indonesia's Chinese minority, were raped during
the riots. But Indonesia's intelligence chief said Monday that no
evidence of rapes has been found.
	   A panel of government officials and human rights activists is
investigating whether some elements of the military were involved
in the riots.
	   Alatas on Tuesday awarded a medal for service to the nation to
Tong Joe, a 72-year-old Indonesian Chinese businessman. He helped
reopen relations between Indonesia and China in 1989.
	   Chinese make up only about 4 percent of Indonesia's 202 million
population. They dominate the country's economy and have been made
scapegoats for the worst economic crisis in 30 years.

Australia will take more refugees from Europe, fewer from Asia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALAN THORNHILL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australia will accept fewer refugee
immigrants from Asia next year and more from Europe, than in the
previous year, Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock said Tuesday.
	   But the shift in refugee origins had nothing to do with the rise
in popularity of right wing politician Pauline Hanson, who warns
Australia is in danger of being ``swamped by Asians,'' the
government said.
	   ``While the overall size of the program is the same as in
1997-98, we are working closely with the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees to ensure that the program remains
targeted to those in greatest need,'' Ruddock said.
	   Ruddock said the biggest single refugee intake would come from
the former Yugoslavia.
	   He said Australia will accept 12,000 people under its
humanitarian program in the 12 months to June 30 1999, a figure
slightly below the 12,055 accepted in the previous 12 months.
	   ``The Middle East and Africa also remain high priority areas for
the program.''
	   He said 4,000 of the 12,000 places would be set aside for
refugees.
	   Ruddock said priority in allocating refugee places would be
given to women who are classified as being at risk.
	   Another 4,250 places would be made available under the
government's special humanitarian program, which is meant to help
people who experience discrimination at such a severe level that it
amounts to gross violation of human rights.
	   Other places are reserved for members of the immediate families
of people who have been accepted under the humanitarian program.
	   Australia accepted 685 people from Southern and Southeast Asia
under its humanitarian migration program last financial year.
	   But this number will be reduced to 180 this financial year.
	   A total of 2,000 refugee places have been reserved for people
who are already in Australia and seeking permanent settlement. This
is an increase from 1,588 last financial year.

Fugitive Australian businessman bought Dominican citizenship
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Fugitive Australian businessman
Christopher Skase paid U.S. dlrs 50,000 (Australian dollars 85,000)
for citizenship of the Caribbean country of Dominica for himself
and his family, Dominican Finance Minister Julius Timothy said
Tuesday.
	   Timothy said the Dominican government knew the Australian
government was trying to secure Skase's return to Australia, but
the former businessman had met all Dominica's citizenship
requirements and would not be barred from entering the tiny
Caribbean nation.
	   ``Mr. Skase, as far as we have been told, is not a criminal,''
Timothy told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   ``As far as we know, he hasn't killed anybody and he's not the
sort of person who one bars from the state.''
	   Since 1994, Australia has been seeking Skase's extradition from
Mallorca, Spain, where he fled after being charged in 1992 in
relation to the 1.5 billion Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 930
million) collapse of his Qintex group of companies.
	   He avoided the 1994 extradition attempt when a Spanish court
ruled that he was too ill to return to Australia.
	   After strenuous lobbying from Australia, Spain in July refused
to extend Skase's residency permit, forcing him to seek refuge
elsewhere to avoid deportation to Australia.
	   Skase obtained a passport through the Dominica's High Commission
in London under a program that does not require applicants to
travel to the tiny Caribbean nation, Timothy said.
	   Skase paid for Dominican officials to travel to Spain to
interview him because the fugitive had not been able to travel, he
said.
	   Under the program, U.S. dlrs 50,000 will buy citizenship for a
husband and wife and two children younger than 18 years, Timothy
said.

Chinese president says flooding will not hurt economy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By WILLIAM E. AHEARN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ President Jiang Zemin said Tuesday that floods
which have devastated vast regions of China will not have a
significant impact on the nation's growing economy.
	   Jiang spoke during a two-hour conversation with current and
former members of the Board of Directors of The Associated Press
and senior AP news executives, led by Chairman of the Board Donald
E. Newhouse and Louis D. Boccardi, president and chief executive
officer of the AP.
	   The Chinese president touched on many topics, including
terrorism, Taiwan, U.S. President Bill Clinton and human rights.
	   But throughout the discussion he frequently returned to the
flooding, interspersing details on the 250 million people displaced
and the size of China's relief efforts with emotional and
philosophical comments on the disaster.
	   He recalled how residents of his hometown of Yangzhou, in
southern China, used tubs as makeshift rafts during floods in 1931,
when he was five.
	   Frequently alluding to his scientific training, he almost
wistfully lamented nature's ability to overwhelm technology:
	   ``We can predict the rainfall, but can't stop it from falling
from the skies,'' he said.
	   In discussing the economic impact of the floods, Jiang said
crops are growing well and life goes on as usual in areas just
beyond the flooding.
	   He said he didn't think the floods would have a significant
negative impact on China's economic growth which is projected at 8
percent, a slight drop from last year's 8.8 percent.
	   ``I hope China will achieve it, but if it is somewhat lower, I
don't think people should be worried,'' he added.
	   He said some areas wiped out by flooding will have to be
rebuilt, and the capital investment required will help stimulate
the economy.
	   The meeting with the AP group, which is on a fact-finding tour
of China, was held at the State Guest House in a large room with a
glass wall overlooking a lake. At one point Jiang interrupted his
comments to point to a trio of swans swimming by.
	   Jiang spoke through an interpreter but occasionally interjected
comments in English. His mood ranged from intense to jovial. He
jabbed his hand toward the ceiling as he talked about Taiwan,
calling it ``an inalienable province of China,'' and ``the most
sensitive in China-US relations.''
	   The 72-year-old Jiang, an electrical engineer by training,
frequently referred to his background, but added that he has a deep
interest in literature. He cited Mark Twain, Henry Wadsworth
Longfellow, Confucius and several Chinese poets. He quoted Song
dynasty poet Wang Anshi as saying ``I do not fear that the floating
clouds might obscure my view because I stand at the top of the
mountain.''
	   Asked what advice he would give to President Clinton on his
current ``personal problems,'' Jiang said: ``Frankly, it is very
difficult to answer. It is a personal question for Clinton. But
with the democratic traditions and wisdom of the American people,
I'm sure that in the end people will put the situation in the right
way.''
	   He added, ``Political struggles are very complex. Things are
easier when personal issues are separated from political ones.''
	   In commenting on himself, he recalled that during his visit to
the United States last year some protesters held up signs
describing him as a ``tyrant,'' and the head of a ``dictatorship.''
	   ``I have met quite a lot of other leaders,'' he said, ``and I
don't believe I've given them the impression that I am a tyrant or
a dictator.''
	   On reunification with Taiwan, Jiang said China wants a peaceful
reconciliation but ``the question should not remain unsettled for
too long.''
	   ``Our policy is clear cut. It is a peaceful one on the basis of
one country, two systems'' _ the same formula that was used in the
recovery of Hong Kong.
	   But he reiterated China's right to use force if necessary.
	   ``We do not commit not to use force,'' he said, ``and our
intention in not disavowing the right to use force is directed at
separatists who are promoting independence... .''
	   When asked about the recent terrorist attacks on American
embassies in East Africa, and the U.S. missile attacks that
followed in Afghanistan and the Sudan, Jiang said: ``We are
unequivocally opposed to terrorism in any form.''
	   ``Our viewpoint is consistent. We believe these matters need to
be resolved based on the U.N charter and normal international
law,'' he said. The United States referred in part to the Charter
to justify the attacks.
	   On other topics, Jiang:
	   _Restated China's commitment to keep its currency, the yuan,
stable amid the Asian financial turmoil, while conceding that
policy ``carries a certain price and a certain risk.''
	   _Said that although some ``dark clouds'' have covered U.S.-China
relations since 1993, ``on the whole, both sides are working toward
building a strategic constructive partnership.''
	   _Acknowledged China and the United States sometimes disagree on
human rights but said ``in a democratic atmosphere we can put the
issues on the table and talk on the principle of non-interference
in each other's affairs.''

Zurich says it expects to complete B.A.T. merger Sept. 7
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland's Zurich Insurance Co.
said Tuesday it expects the merger of its financial services
business with that of British tobacco group B.A.T. to be completed
by Sept. 7.
	   Both companies are confident they will receive all necessary
approvals from national authorities by then, Zurich said in a
statement.
	   The merger, announced last October, will create one of the
world's largest insurance and asset management companies.
	   The new company will have combined funds under management of
around dlrs 342 billion, based on 1996 figures. It will have
combined gross premiums of around dlrs 37 billion.
	   Possible legal steps in connection with U.S. tobacco lawsuits
aren't expected to delay the transaction's completion, Zurich said.

Malaysian opposition lawmaker goes to prison on sedition charges
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos Available

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The Federal Court on Tuesday
upheld the 18-month prison term of an opposition member of
Parliament on charges of sedition for having criticized the
Malaysian judiciary.
	   Lim Guan Eng, deputy secretary-general of the Democratic Action
Party and a member of Parliament for 12 years, became the first
sitting Malaysian legislator to be sent to prison.
	   If forced to serve his full term, Lim will lose his seat in
Parliament. Under Malaysian law, a lawmaker must relinquish his
seat if he serves more than 12 months in prison.
	   The case is being watched closely by human rights activists.
Representatives of Amnesty International and the International
Community of Jurists attended the hearing.
	   Lim, 38, was convicted last year of sedition and printing
``false news'' in a pamphlet distributed in 1995 entitled, ``The
True Story.''
	   In it, he criticized the government's decision not to press
statutory rape charges against Abdul Rahim Tamby Chik, a former
chief minister of Lim's home state, Malacca.
	   The pamphlet questioned why the 15-year-old girl involved in the
scandal was detained for more than two years, but not Abdul Rahim,
a leading member of the ruling United Malays National Organization.
	   Prosecutors at the time said they didn't have enough evidence
against Abdul Rahim, though he was suspended by UMNO and earlier
this year lost his bid for a division UMNO seat.
	   A three-judge panel of the Federal Court upheld a sentence of
two, concurrent 18-month prison terms, set by a lower appellate
court. It also denied Lim's request for the case to be heard by a
larger panel of judges.
	   Lim's original sentence called for a 15,000 ringgit (dlrs 3,570)
fine. It was dismissed and replaced with a jail term by the Court
of Appeal in April, when Lim lost his first appeal.
	   On Monday, public prosecutor Azhar Mohamad argued that the stiff
sentence was needed to send a message to Malaysians that they could
not spread false news and get off lightly.
	   ``His words could be exploited by irresponsible elements and
could cause chaos,'' Azhar said of Lim. He said a reversal of the
lower court ruling would ``undermine the credibility and the
integrity of the judiciary.''
	   Lim's father, Lim Kit Siang, is the opposition leader in
Parliament and head of the Democratic Action Party.
	   The Lims, members of Parliament for a combined 41 years, believe
that as Malaysia struggles against economic collapse, the
opposition has become a scapegoat for a government desperate to
appear in command.
	   In 1987, both father and son were arrested under the Internal
Security Act, which allows suspects to be held without trial if
deemed a threat to national security. They were held for 18 months
with three other opposition members of Parliament.

Military regime warns opposition to not undermine stability
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ The military regime has warned leaders of
Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi's political party they risk long
prison sentences if they disrupt national stability.
	   The warning came during an extremely rare meeting Monday between
government officials _ mostly high-ranking security figures _ and
two members of the National League for Democracy's central
executive committee.
	   Official newspapers Tuesday carried brief, back-page accounts of
the meeting and noted that Home Affairs Minister Col. Tin Hlaing
told the NLD members ``to avoid acts which will undermine stability
and peace and the rule of law in the country.''
	   Tin Oo, an NLD vice chairman, elaborated that the officials had
read out a 1996 law that makes demonstrations or acts undermining a
constitutional convention punishable by five to 20 years in prison.
A party violating it would be declared illegal.
	   The warning came hours after the first street protest by student
demonstrations in nearly two years. At the same time, Suu Kyi ended
a 13-day roadside standoff against authorities, who stopped her
from meeting supporters in the provinces.
	   Suu Kyi, 53, was believed to be meeting with party officials
Tuesday at her home. About 40 members of the party milled about the
group's downtown headquarters, awaiting word of her health.
	   The NLD had urged Suu Kyi to end her test of wills with the
government and return home from a bridge 32 kilometers (19 miles)
outside Yangon, where her van had been stopped since Aug. 12.
	   Her doctors had said she was suffering from kidney and urinary
tract problems, low blood pressure and dizziness. Tin Oo said
Monday that she was feeling the effects of dehydration and possible
shock from low blood sugar levels.
	   The numbers of uniformed police stationed near the U.S. Embassy
was meanwhile increased amid rumors that pro-democracy
demonstrators would attempt to stage small hit-and-run
demonstrations against the Myanmar government. None was immediately
confirmed.
	   The demonstration Monday by about 200 students at a street
intersection was the first since December 1996, when several days
of student protests demanding more civil liberties were quelled by
the closure of the universities. They remain closed.
	   It was the most open display of public discontent this month,
which marks the 10th anniversary of a national uprising against
military rule that was brutally crushed by troops, killing an
estimated 3,000 people.
	   Suu Kyi has raised the profile of her struggle to bring more
democracy to Myanmar, also known as Burma, this month and demanded
that the military convene the parliament that was elected in a vote
allowed eight years ago.
	   The military, which has ruled since 1962, never honored the
result of the vote after Suu Kyi's party won in a landslide.
	   Official newspapers said in a commentary Tuesday that no
parliament could be called until a constitutional convention _
which has not met for two years _ drafts a new charter.
	   The NLD pulled out in 1995, declaring the military had stacked
the process to keep its grip on power. The constitution-drafting
process was launched only after the 1990 election.

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's exhausted flood fighters were ordered to
remain on guard as a new surge of high water barrelled down the
Yangtze River on Tuesday, threatening to overwhelm dikes weakened
by a summer of devastating floods.
	   China's flood control headquarters described the situation as
``extremely serious.'' It warned that along a 300-kilometer
(180-kilometer) stretch of the river, water levels stood at record
highs and some places have been inundated for 60 days or more.
	   The new Yangtze flood crest _ the seventh so far in a summer of
flooding that has seen thousands killed and millions made homeless
_ was expected to plunge through the Three Gorges Dam and enter the
middle Yangtze Tuesday night.
	   President Jiang Zemin noted the heroic efforts of 2.1 million
civilians and soldiers manning dikes on the Yangtze. But he
predicted that the devastation will not significantly impact
China's economy.
	   In an interview with current and former members of the Board of
Directors of The Associated Press, Jiang also lamented nature's
ability to overwhelm modern technology.
	   ``We can predict the rainfall, but can't stop it from falling
from the skies,'' Jiang said.
	   Flooding is at its worst along the Yangtze in 44 years and in
decades in the northeast. The flooding has affected 250 million
people, a fifth of the population, to varying degrees.
	   Vital dikes that protect major industrial centers and rich
farmland are ``once again facing a serious test,'' the flood
control headquarters said.
	   Revised figures on deaths and damage from the flooding were
expected at a government news conference scheduled for later
Tuesday. At the last news conference nearly three weeks ago, the
government revised the death toll sharply upwards to more than
2,000 people killed nationwide.
	   While the flood crest was not expected to reach the highs of
those that preceded it, flood fighters were told to prepare.
	   ``Persevere and persevere again to win the climatic battle in
the fight against floods,'' the Communist Party newspaper People's
Daily exhorted.
	   Hubei, a central province among the most badly flooded, was
concentrating troops along dikes that threatened to give way, the
People's Daily said. Officials ordered that lighting and telephones
be set up along endangered dikes and stocks of sand, stone and
sacks for sandbags be prepared, the newspaper reported.
	   Nearly 20,000 medical teams with 130,000 people were working in
flood-hit areas to prevent the spread of diseases and distribute
medicines.
	   Manufacturers of life jackets, bottled drinking water, medicines
and fast food were asked to work overtime to provide supplies for
flood victims, the official Xinhua News Agency said.
	   Meanwhile, the government worked to prevent the misuse or theft
of relief funds and donations. Hubei's government fired officials
who embezzled 2,000 yuan (dlrs 240) or more in relief money, Xinhua
said.

Seven sets of suspected U.S. remains repatriated

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ The remains of what are believed to be
seven Americans killed during the Vietnam War were repatriated to
the United States on Tuesday.
	   U.S. Ambassador Pete Peterson, a former prisoner of war here,
was on hand as an 11-person honor guard _ representatives from the
Marines, Army, Air Force and Navy _ received small wooden boxes
containing the remains.
	   He called the occasion ``bittersweet.''
	   ``It harkens back to a time of warfare, but at the same time
allows families to rest after 30 years,'' Peterson said.
	   Lt. Col. Matt Martin said officials are fairly certain, after
preliminary investigations, that the remains are those of American
military personnel. Several 1967 pennies were found with one set.
	   As about 40 people watched, the boxes were loaded into metal
coffins, covered with American flags and put aboard a C-17 military
airplane that was to take them to Hawaii for positive verification
at the military's Central Identification Laboratory.
	   The honor guard flew in on the plane, which was on the ground
for little more than an hour at Hanoi's Noibai International
Airport on a hot, sunny day, then accompanied the remains to
Hawaii.
	   Also on board the plane when it arrived were 40 to 50 members of
the latest excavation and investigation teams who will be digging
at several sites for more remains over the next month.
	   Overall, 2,081 Americans are still listed as missing in action
in Indochina, including 1,554 in Vietnam. More than 300,000
Vietnamese are also listed as MIA.

Japan's Obuchi defends LTCB bailout
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi on Tuesday defended a
government-backed rescue plan for the troubled Long-Term Credit
Bank of Japan Ltd. against scathing criticism by opposition
parties.
	   The bank last week announced a major restructuring plan and
asked for public funds to help write off some 750 billion yen (dlrs
5.3 billion) in bad loans.
	   The plan has met harsh criticism of its use of public funds.
	   Eijiro Hata, a senior politician in the main opposition
Democratic Party, said the government hadn't proved that LTCB
wasn't bankrupt, and it was therefore improper to spend government
money on it.
	   ``The government needs to clearly explain to the public why LTCB
needs public money,'' he said, accusing the government of trying to
prop up bankrupt banks with public funds.
	   Obuchi told Parliament that LTCB's internal assessment was that
its debts didn't exceed assets as of the fiscal year-end last March
31, and that a Bank of Japan study hadn't found it was insolvent
either.
	   He also said the public funds for LTCB weren't intended to help
an individual bank or protect it against bankruptcy, but to
preserve the stability of the overall financial system.
	   Hata also criticized the government's package of bills to clean
up Japan's debt-laden banking system, under which the recently
created Financial Supervisory Agency would play a major role.
	   Hata said the clean-up scheme didn't include sufficient
disclosure of banks' bad debts, and that the FSA wasn't willing to
improve disclosure. Another, independent body needs to be created
to run the clean-up scheme, Hata said.
	   Obuchi argued that quick passage of the banking bills were
necessary for financial stability and the economy, and promised to
listen to opposition complaints.

United Bank of Switzerland posts rise in net profit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH (AP) _ Swiss banking giant United Bank of Switzerland on
Tuesday reported a 22 percent rise in net profit to 3.51 billion
Swiss francs (dlrs dlrs 2.34 billion).
	   The figures take into account provisions for the dlrs 1.25
billion class action settlement to Holocaust survivors in the
United States and proceeds from the sale of Banca Della Svizzera
Italiana, which amounted to 1.04 billion francs (dlrs 690 million)
in pre-tax profit.
	   Excluding those items, net profit rose 5 percent to 3.02 billion
francs (dlrs 2.01 billion).
	   UBS said it expects financial results for the second half to be
below those for the first six months.
	   Excluding the influence of special factors such as the BSI sale
and provisions for the class action settlement, UBS expects net
profit after tax to rise around 10 percent for the full year 1998
from the consolidated 1997 result of 4.8 billion francs (dlrs 3.2
billion).
	   Operating income rose 14 percent to 14.51 billion francs (dlrs
dlrs 9.7 billion) for the first six months.
	   Over the same period, operating expenses rose 9 percent to 9.9
billion francs (dlrs 6.6 billion).
	   UBS was formed in June as a result of the merger of two major
Swiss banks, Union Bank of Switzerland and Swiss Bank Corporation.
	   Provisions for the settlement of a U.S. class action suit by
Holocaust victims amount to 544 million francs (dlrs 362.6
million).
	   All five units of UBS - the Private Banking Unit, investment
banking division Warburg Dillon Read, the Private and Corporate
Clients Division, UBS Brinson and UBS Capital - posted higher
results in the first six months.
	   Total managed assets stood at 1,663 billion francs (dlrs 1,108.6
billion).

Supporters of Indonesian pro-democracy leader battle police
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with injured to at least nine from four, police firing
warning shots, other details; ADDS locator for Palu. One name only
for Soerjadi is correct.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - Police fired warning shots and tear
gas Tuesday at stone-throwing supporters of a pro-democracy leader
who tried to disrupt a congress held by a rival party faction.
	   At least nine people were injured in the clash involving
followers of opposition figure Megawati Sukarnoputri in the
Sulawesi island city of Palu.
	   Police Maj. Ida Kartati said the injured included five police
officers and four protesters. The official Antara news agency,
however, reported that 14 people were hurt.
	   Megawati was ousted as head of the minority Indonesian
Democratic Party in a military-sponsored party congress in June
1996, when Indonesia was led by former President Suharto. The
autocratic leader quit in May amid riots and student protests.
	   The government-backed candidate who replaced Megawati, Soerjadi,
opened a congress this week in Palu, 1,550 kilometers (960 miles)
northeast of the capital, Jakarta, to pick a new leader of the
party, known as PDI.
	   However, about 1,000 Megawati backers converged on the building
where the congress was being held, claiming that Soerjadi had been
illegally installed as chief of the party.
	   Fighting broke out when they tried to force their way into the
congress hall and police blocked them. Security guards at the
congress also hurled rocks at the Megawati supporters.
	   On Aug. 19, the Supreme Court threw out a lawsuit by Megawati in
which she alleged that breakaway PDI leaders and government
officials plotted her ouster.
	   Megawati is the eldest daughter of Sukarno, Indonesian's
founding president. She is seen as a strong candidate for president
in elections set for next year.
	   In May, President B.J. Habibie took over from Suharto, pledging
democratic reforms in the nation of 202 million.
	   Megawati was ousted as PDI leader because of her consistent
calls for greater democracy in the country, which was ruled with an
iron hand by Suharto for three decades.
	   Her ouster set off riots in Jakarta on July 27, 1996, following
the storming of the party's headquarters by police and Soerjadi's
supporters.
	   At least five people were killed and more than a dozen are still
missing from the rioting.

Yeltsin fills legal limbo, asks current Cabinet to carry on duties
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin on Tuesday took the nation
out of legal limbo, decreeing that the members of recently ousted
Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko's Cabinet should stay on the job
until replacements are appointed.
	   The acting prime minister Yeltsin named on Sunday, Viktor
Chernomyrdin, meanwhile huddled with his political allies in the
lower house of parliament, the State Duma _ leaders of his Our Home
Is Russia party and the centrist Russia's Regions group. The
parliamentary vote to confirm Chernomyrdin is expected no earlier
than next week.
	   In an interview published Tuesday, Chernomyrdin said he would
try to soften the impact of the country's financial crisis on
ordinary Russians and support ailing industries.
	   ``The protection of social interests will be our first
priority,'' he said in an interview with the daily Komsomolskaya
Pravda. ``The second will be state industrial policy, since we
can't take Russia out of crisis by purely monetary moves.''
	   Critics have said that it was Chernomyrdin's past policy of
unrealistic budgets and continuous support of inefficient
industries that precipitated the current crisis. However, his call
for more support to state industry will certainly win a sympathetic
ear of the Communists and other hardliners in parliament.
	   ``There are many reasonable people in the Duma whose political
support I'm counting on,'' Chernomyrdin was quoted as saying.
	   Yeltsin ousted Chernomyrdin in March and fought hard for his
successor, the young Sergei Kiriyenko, to be approved by the
Communist-dominated Duma, arguing that the country needed ``fresh
ideas and unorthodox approaches'' to overcome its stagnation.
	   However, the economy went into a nose dive shortly after
Kiriyenko's appointment and he spent his short term waging a losing
battle against the intermittent waves of financial crisis.
	   After the government finally surrendered last week, effectively
devaluing the ruble 34 percent despite repeated pledges to avoid
that step, Yeltsin applied his customary tactics of shifting the
blame and ousted Kiriyenko as suddenly as he had previously fired
Chernomyrdin.
	   Some Russian media on Tuesday interpreted the government shakeup
as a sign that Yeltsin's condition had deteriorated to the point
where he might step down any moment.
	   ``It has become quite clear that Russia lacks not only a
government, but a president as well,'' the business daily
Kommersant said in a front-page commentary.
	   The Kremlin insisted that Yeltsin's health was fine, but the
president, who has just returned from a month-long vacation, looked
tired and has had trouble following reporters' questions in his
recent public appearances.

	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin's decision
to reshuffle his Cabinet is an internal affair that should not

the Communist Party newspaper Nhan Dan on Tuesday quoted a Foreign

	   LONDON (AP) _ In a move certain to rattle the Boeing Co.,
British Airways said Tuesday it will order its first batch of jets
from Europe's Airbus Industrie.
	   Airbus called a news conference later Tuesday with British Prime
Minister Tony Blair and Airbus President Noel Forgeard at its
headquarters in Toulouse, France, to unveil details of the plan.
	   British Airways plans to buy 59 short-haul jets in the A320
family, with options to buy another 129, the airline said in a
statement released Tuesday morning.
	   Despite the partial defection to Airbus, British Airways still
plans to fly lots of Boeings, keeping the Seattle-based company as
its supplier for larger jets.
	   In its statement, the airline said it will buy 16 Boeing 777s,
with options for 16 more.
	   ``We never like to lose any campaign, but this was hard fought
and one we knew would be difficult from the beginning,'' Boeing
spokeswoman Janice Hayes in Brussels said of the Airbus order.
``Airbus won half a victory.''
	   Hayes said the British Airways move would not result any job
losses at Boeing.

Tokyo stocks rebound, dollar rises against yen
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES with closing bond and late afternoon
currency; ADDS analyst comment in 7th graf

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stocks rebounded above the psychologically
important 15,000-point level on Tuesday, boosted by gains on Wall
Street. The U.S. dollar recouped earlier losses against the yen.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed up 84.57 points, or
0.56 percent, at 15,072.93. On Monday, the average lost 309.84
points, or 2.03 percent.
	   On currency markets, the dollar bought 144.76 yen as of late
afternoon, up 0.36 yen from late Monday in Tokyo and above its late
New York rate of 143.95 yen overnight.
	   Stocks gained following the overnight rise on Wall Street, where
the Dow Jones industrial average rose 32.96 points, or 0.4 percent.
	   Traders said they were heartened by the Dow's resilience despite
the ambiguity that still clouds Russia's future. The Nikkei had
plunged Monday after Russian President Boris Yeltsin suddenly
sacked his cabinet.
	   After soaring at the open, the Nikkei ceded some of those gains
in afternoon trading amid concern a series of bills aimed at
cleaning up the bad loan problems at Japanese banks may fail to
pass Parliament.
	   Debate on the six bills began Tuesday, but smooth passage is
doubtful as opposition parties have said they oppose the use of
public funds to bail out banks.
	   ``How the government intends to deal with the problem loan
situation of banks is still unclear. It looks like the discussions
could drag on,'' said Takeshi Kubota, manager of equity strategy at
Meiko Securities Co.
	   About 360 million shares changed hands on the first section, up
from 295 million shares Monday. Advancing issues outnumbered
decliners 3-to-2.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 4.28 points, or 0.37 percent, to 1,162.58. The
TOPIX closed down 18.21 points, or 1.55 percent, the day before.
	   On the currency market, the dollar recovered earlier losses
after Japan's finance minister seemed to downplay the likelihood of
government intervention to support the yen.
	   The dollar had fallen as low as 143.25 yen Tuesday morning on
worries over possible intervention by monetary authorities. But in
a news conference later in the day, Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa indicated he didn't see any need to intervene now.
	   His comments helped send the dollar as high as 144.83 yen.
Traders saw them as a signal Japan won't intervene unless the
dollar goes much, much higher.
	   ``If the dollar was flying past 145 and looked to go to 150,
that would have a negative impact on Asia and (Japan) would have to
be prepared to do something about it,'' said Eji Takane, deputy
general manager of foreign exchange at Asahi Bank Ltd.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.125 percent from Monday's close of 1.135
percent, driving its price up to 112.26 yen from Monday's 112.19
yen.

Investors await government decision on debt restructuring
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Russia-Politics &QL; 
 &UR; By JUDITH INGRAM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin has
approved a plan to restructure dlrs 40 billion in short-term debt,
including more than dlrs 11 billion in bonds held by foreign
investors, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported Tuesday.
	   The terms were to be announced later in the day, more than a
week after the government announced that the country's severe
economic crisis would force a debt restructuring. The announcement
has already been postponed twice, after foreign investors protested
that the restructuring would favor Russian commercial banks.
	   The delay reflected Russia's political limbo following President
Boris Yeltsin's dismissal of Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko on
Sunday. On his first day in office, Chernomyrdin on Monday asked
the State Duma, the lower house of parliament, to set aside ``for
the time being'' a set of economic austerity measures that had been
demanded by international lenders and formulated by Kiriyenko's
team.
	   The ruble was falling fast at its official trading session
Tuesday, despite heavy intervention by the Russian Central Bank.
Shortly after the start of trading, the ruble had already fallen
9.9 percent, and was trading at 7.8500 to the dollar, compared to
7.1400 to the dollar Monday.
	   The bank has been selling dollars steadily in recent sessions in
an effort to slow the fall of the Russian currency. By midday on
Tuesday alone, it had already spent about dlrs 340 million to
defend the ruble, traders said. Trading was suspended twice on the
interbank currency exchange when the Central Bank was overwhelmed
by demand for dollars.
	   A commission including representatives of the government and
both chambers of parliament began work Tuesday on a draft program
of economic and social policy, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The acting Cabinet still has to smooth out some legal details of
the documents necessary to carry out the debt swap, said Vadim
Birkin, spokesman for acting Deputy Prime Minister Boris Fyodorov.
	   International creditors to Russian banks got few reassurances
from the Central Bank in talks over the rescheduling of Russian
commercial debt, foreign investors in Moscow said.
	   At the meeting, the Central Bank and Finance Ministry said they
would take on no liabilities from commercial banks.
	   ``There was an agreement to continue talking, but nothing much
happened at this meeting itself,'' said a representative a major
western commercial bank who attended the meeting and spoke on
condition of anonymity.
	   Kommersant, a leading business newspaper, reported Tuesday that
the terms of the short-term debt restructuring would be identical
for foreign and domestic investors. The plan involves dlrs 40
billion worth of outstanding bond issues, which are to be swapped
for longer-term bonds.
	   Investors across the board fear they will be able to exchange
their bonds only at a huge loss.

Officials seize 200,000 pirated compact discs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Facing American pressure to crack down on
copyright violations, customs officers detained five men Tuesday
and seized 200,000 pirated compact discs valued at 4 million Hong
Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 512,820).
	   A government statement gave no other details of the raid on the
discs storage center or the suspects, but said they were helping
officials in their investigation.
	   Hong Kong has come under international pressure to do a better
job of protecting intellectual property. U.S. officials say the
territory has become a production and distribution center for
pirated discs since mainland China began cracking down on copyright
piracy.
	   Early this year, U.S. officials decided to keep Hong Kong on a
watch list for copyright violation.
	   Despite frequent raids, stores selling pirated compact discs or
CD-ROMs still thrive in busy shopping centers in the territory.
Copies of local or Hollywood movies are widely available for under
40 Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 5), sometimes before they're
released in local cinemas.
	   In April, officers of Hong Kong's anti-corruption agency seized
7 million pirated video discs and production equipment worth U.S.
dlrs 83 million, the biggest such seizure in Hong Kong's history.

Pakistan cricket chief says Australia has no need to fear
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Australia's cricket team will be safe
in Pakistan, a Pakistani cricket official was quoted as saying
Monday after hearing the players were concerned about reports of
anti-foreigner sentiment.
	   The Australians are due in Pakistan at the end of September.
Australia's Cricket Board sought advice from Australia's Department
of Foreign Affairs about the planned tour following a U.S. missile
strike on alleged terrorist training camps in neighboring
Afghanistan.
	   At the moment, the Australian government is advising against all
but essential travel to Pakistan and monitoring the security
situation.
	   Majid Khan, chief executive of the Pakistan Cricket Board, said
there was no reason for concern, according to the national
Pakistani newspaper The News.
	   ``First, Pakistan is not a party to the tussle, and secondly the
tension will ease by the time the Australians arrive here for the
three-test series,'' Khan was quoted as saying.
	   Foreigners are keeping a low-profile in Pakistan. No attacks on
foreigners have been reported, but there have been largely peaceful
anti-U.S. demonstrations across Pakistan. Protesters accusing the
United States of violating the sovereignty of a neighbor and a
fellow-Muslim country.
	   Australia's second cricket test in the upcoming tour will be
played in Peshawar, a city near the Afghanistan border that has
seen scattered violence during anti-U.S. protests in recent days.
	   Australian players were hit with bottles and other debris during
a one-day game against South Africa the last time they traveled to
Pakistan, in 1994.

Italian star Vieri out of favor in Madrid; may head back to
</HEADLINE>
Juventus &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Branded as a ``Little Brat'' by one paper,
top Italian striker Christian Vieri has fallen out of favor with
Spanish club Atletico de Madrid and may be returning home soon,
most likely to old club Juventus, news reports said Tuesday.
	   Comparing the 25-year-old striker to a spoilt child in its
front-page banner headline, the leading sports daily Marca said
Vieri had been ruled out as a team starter after arriving for a
pre-season game against Italian side Lazio just 15 minutes before
play last Saturday.
	   Atletico's new Italian coach Arrigo Sacchi, known for his strict
disciplinary style, lost his patience with the tall striker, ruled
him out for the Lazio game and warned he would not play again for
Atletico unless he changed his attitude, Marca said.
	   Atletico won the game 3-0.
	   ``There's no doubt that Italian clubs want him. To top it all,
he's told us he wants to go to Italy,'' Atletico chairman Jesus Gil
y Gil told the leading daily El Pais.
	   Although Gil said he hoped Vieri would stay with Atletico, he
described him as ``a child, a man without personality.'' He warned,
however, that any club wishing to buy Vieri would have to cough up
at least 4.5 billion pesetas (dlrs 30 million).
	   Vieri arrived from Juventus for dlrs 19 million in July, 1997.
Gil said offers to fish him back had come from the Italian club
both before and after the World Cup in France this summer.
	   Despite being injured for much of last season, Vieri managed to
end up leading scorer with 24 goals. In the World Cup, he scored
five goals for Italy.

MQM withdraws from provincial government, threatens to pull it
</HEADLINE>
down &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ A powerful ethnic party withdrew from
the provincial Cabinet in Pakistan's most important economic region
Tuesday, and threatened to pull down the Sindh government.
	   ``It was impossible for the MQM (Mohajir Qaumi Movement), to
continue working in a government that is totally ineffective,''
party spokesman Kunwar Khalid Yunas told The Associated Press. The
MQM has accused the Pakistan Muslim League-led government in Sindh
of failing to control violence in the provincial capital of
Karachi, Pakistan's financial hub.
	   Yunas said the MQM had not yet decided whether to oppose the
government, which would bring it down. Its eight ministers, out of
a total of 19 in the Cabinet, tendered their resignations Tuesday.
	   The MQM, which represents Mohajirs, or Muslims who came to
Pakistan from India, has for years been locked in a bloody power
struggle over Karachi with a breakaway Mohajir faction.
	   More than 500 people have been killed in Karachi's political,
ethnic and sectarian violence this year, compared with about 400 in
1997.

Pakistan officials try to defuse U.S. missile
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Troops cordoned off a patch of
western Pakistani desert Tuesday as experts worked to defuse a U.S.
Tomahawk missile that was meant for neighboring Afghanistan.
	   Pakistan has protested to the U.N. Security Council that the
United States violated its airspace to launch missiles on what
Washington said were terrorist training camps in eastern
Afghanistan. The unexploded missile that landed by accident in
Pakistan was proof of the U.S. violation, Pakistan's foreign
ministry said.
	   Embassy spokesman Richard Hoagland said U.S. officials could not
immediately confirm that a missile had fallen in Pakistan. The
missile reportedly did little damage and caused no injuries.
	   ``It was certainly not our intention to harm Pakistan,''
Hoagland said.
	   Mir Hakim Baloch, the provincial cabinet minister in charge of
security, said his government first learned of the missile Sunday
from a truck driver who had seen it in Shatinger, a remote area
some 600 kilometers (375 miles) south of the U.S. target near
Khost, Afghanistan.
	   Bomb disposal teams were brought in, but had not yet defused the
missile Tuesday morning, Baloch said. Sand bags were placed around
the weapon, residents in a wide area were evacuated and journalists
barred from the spot.
	   An 18-foot (5-meter) Tomahawk is capable of carrying up to 1,000
pounds (450 kilograms) of explosives.
	   The government earlier had to retract a report that a U.S.
missile that fell during a barrage on Afghanistan last week landed
in Pakistan and killed several people. Pakistan fired its
intelligence chief, Manzoor Ahmed, for passing on the false report
officials said was based on inaccurate information.
	   The United States fired 73 Tomahawk missiles at six targets in a
camp in eastern Afghanistan linked to Saudi dissident Osama bin
Laden. Bin Laden is accused of directing worldwide terror attacks
from Afghanistan, including the Aug. 7 bombings of two U.S.
embassies in East Africa that killed a total of 257 people.
	   The attack on a neighboring, fellow-Muslim country has prompted
daily anti-American protests around Pakistan. The government has
condemned the simultaneous U.S. attacks on Afghanistan and Sudan,
where Washington said chemical weapons were being manufactured for
terrorist use.
	   ``While supporting the efforts of the international community to
combat (terrorism), Pakistan takes a serious view of the unilateral
action taken by the United States, involving violation of
Pakistan's air space and use of force against the sovereignty of
the brotherly countries of Afghanistan and Sudan,'' Pakistani
Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz told the Senate on Tuesday.

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A man convicted on charges of illegal
bookmaking during this year's World Cup received a four-month
suspended jail term Tuesday.
	   A police statement said the unidentified man was also fined
500,00 Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 6,400).
	   He was arrested when police raided several bars in Hong Kong's
red-light district of Wanchai in June at the height of World Cup
frenzy.
	   Under Hong Kong laws, those accepting bets illegally face a
maximum jail term of seven years and a fine of 5 million Hong Kong
dollars (U.S. dlrs 649,000).
	   Gambling is banned in Hong Kong except on horse races and some
lotteries.

Thailand's growth expected to shrink still more
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand told the International
Monetary Fund on Tuesday that the economy in 1998 will slow down
more than previously forecast, shrinking about 7 percent.
	   The forecasts were part of a letter of intent to the IMF
approved Tuesday by Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai's Cabinet to
govern the fifth quarter of the IMF's dlrs 17.2 billion program to
rescue the Thai economy.
	   The targets are in line with talks between Thai and IMF
officials in Bangkok earlier this month and confirm that Thailand's
economy _ the first to sink in the wave of crises hitting Asia
since mid-1997 _ will suffer still more.
	   Gross domestic product is expected to decline 7 percent in 1998,
followed by a recovery in growth in 1999, the statement said.
	   ``The economy will bottom towards the end of the year, setting
the stage for a modest recovery of growth in 1999,'' the statement
said.
	   The letter of intent comes before the IMF board Sept. 10.
	   The increasing severity of Thailand's recession and the costs of
a government program to assist in recapitalization of financial
institutions has led to a higher public sector deficit.
	   Thailand's GDP shrank by 0.4 percent in 1997, and the projected
contraction this year has worsened with each quarter. In the last
letter of intent, estimates were 4 percent to 5.5 percent
shrinkage.
	   The initial Thai-IMF agreement a year ago _ drafted after the
currency, the baht, was floated and plummeted _ called for a public
sector surplus equivalent to 1 percent of GDP for the current
fiscal year to Sept. 30.
	   Since then, the baht has stabilized from its pre-flotation value
of 25 to dlrs 1 to 40 to dlrs 1, allowing the government to lower
interest rates and boost spending in an attempt to reverse the
economic decline.
	   The government budget deficit in the fiscal year to Sept. 30,
1999, will be equivalent to 1 percent of GDP, down from 2.4 percent
this fiscal year, according to the letter.
	   But the state enterprise investment budget deficit will rise to
2 percent from 0.6 percent.
	   An additional 1.5 percent of GDP will be budgeted to pay
interest on government bonds issued to recapitalize financial
institutions and the central bank's bank rescue fund.
	   The current account is believed to record a surplus of dlrs 11
billion to dlrs 12 billion in 1998, equivalent to 10 percent of
GDP, mainly due to a collapse in imports because of the recession.
	   Exports are seen dropping by 3 percent in dollar terms in 1998.
	   Inflation is forecast at 9.2 percent for the year. Prior to
Tuesday's revision, the forecast was 10.5 percent.

Six adolescents killed in Algeria
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RACHID KHIARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ In a brutal killing, attackers slit the
throats of six Algerian adolescents and then maimed and mined the
corpses, rescue workers and family members said Tuesday.
	   The bodies of the young people, aged 12 to 15, were found Monday
in an underground passage in Algiers near official residences used
to house foreign visitors to the capital, said workers at the
Mustapha hospital, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The victims were killed by an armed group in a tunnel leading
from the Saint Raphael garden to a nearby boulevard. The tunnel
extends over four kilometers (2.5 miles) on four levels with at
least four exits.
	   Nobody claimed responsibility for the attack.
	   The Armed Islamic Group, which is trying to oust the
military-backed regime, has been known to use the tunnel as well as
other underground passages and the city's sewers to move about the
capital.
	   At the beginning of this year, Algerian authorities closed most
of the entrances to the tunnels and to the sewer network.
	   The six victims lived in the center of Algiers. According to a
sister of one of the victims, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
they had been led into the tunnel by a ``friend.''
	   According to a source close to the Algerian security services,
five of the adolescents were knifed to death while the six was shot
in the head.
	   The six corpses were mined and sappers were called in to defuse
the explosives.
	   The El Biar neighborhood has many embassies and has been rarely
touched by the violence that has claimed at least 75,000 lives
since 1992.
	   The unrest was triggered by the decision of the authorities to
cancel parliamentary elections that the now banned Islamic
Salvation Front was set to win.

Serbs accused of killing three charity workers in Kosovo

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police killed three ethnic
Albanian workers for the Mother Teresa charity who were taking
humanitarian aid to refugees in Kosovo, a newspaper reported
Tuesday.
	   The ethnic Albanian daily Koha Ditore said the three were killed
Monday after police allowed them to pass through a checkpoint near
Malisevo, a former rebel stronghold in central Kosovo that Serb
forces overran last month.
	   Citing eyewitnesses, Koha Ditore said police subsequently
shelled the tractor they were riding on to take aid into the
region, one of the most densely refugee-populated in the war-torn
province of southern Serbia.
	   Two of the victims were identified as Adem Morina, 40, and
Hajriz Morina, 24.
	   No further details were available. The Pristina branch of the
Mother Teresa charitable foundation said it could not immediately
confirm the report because it had no communication with field
crews.
	   The foundation has been distributing wheat flour, soap and other
aid provided by the World Food Program and the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees. Humanitarian agencies estimate about
50,000 Kosovo refugees are trying to survive in the open.
	   The report came as Serb forces were shelling several villages
just southwest of Pristina, showing no signs of easing up in their
drive to crush separatist resistance among Kosovo's majority ethnic
Albanians.
	   The latest offensive by Serb police and the Serb-dominated
Yugoslav army began late Sunday.
	   On Monday, dirt roads winding through the cornfields south of
the capital were dotted with tractors or horses pulling trailers
full of ethnic Albanian women and children trying to find safety
from the newest assault.
	   Smoke from burning villages billowed into the sky, and the boom
of explosions and screaming of jets _ apparently belonging to the
Yugoslav air force _ mingled with the crowing of roosters.
	   In New York, the U.N. Security Council urged a cease-fire in the
Yugoslav province and warned of a humanitarian disaster if fighting
continues. But the statement reflected the lack of any consensus
among council members on how to halt the conflict.
	   ``The authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the
Kosovo Albanians must achieve a political solution to the issue of
Kosovo,'' the 15-member council said in a statement. It said that
as winter approaches, the plight of refugees will worsen.
	   Another ethnic Albanian daily, Bujku, said Tuesday that the
families of six ethnic Albanians killed in the Drenica region last
month have appealed to the International Red Cross to help allow
them to reclaim and bury the bodies. They said Serb authorities
have declined access.

Two bombs damage Athens bank, town planning headquarters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Two makeshift gas canister bombs exploded
in central Athens early Monday, one outside a bank and the other
outside the capital's town planning headquarters, causing damage
but no injuries, police said.
	   The first bomb, consisting of 15 propane gas canisters, severely
damaged a Commercial Bank branch in the Kypseli district, police
said. Damage was estimated at around 40 million drachmas (dlrs
130,000).
	   Commercial is the parent bank of Ionian Bank, which is currently
undergoing privatization. Bids for Ionian were made Monday, but no
decision was taken on the sale.
	   A much smaller bomb exploded later outside Athens' town planning
headquarters in the city center, causing minor damage to the
building.
	   There were no immediate claims of responsibility for either
blast.
	   Similar devices have been used to torch more than 150 cars and
offices since January. They belonged to officials, politicians,
Jewish and anti-Semitic groups, diplomats, journalists and
foreigners.
	   Most have been claimed by shadowy groups little known to
authorities.

Russian court convicts two men of abducting two Mormon
</HEADLINE>
missionaries &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A court in a southern Russian city has convicted
two local men of kidnapping a pair of American Mormon missionaries,
according to a newspaper report Tuesday.
	   The abductors kept Andrew Lee Propst, 20, of Lebanon, Oregon,
and Travis Robert Tuttle, 20, of Gilbert, Arizona, in handcuffs for
five days in March in the Volga River city of Saratov, about 700
kilometers (450 miles) southeast of Moscow, and demanded a dlrs
300,000 ransom from the Mormon Church. Then they lost their nerve
and set the two free, fearing they would be found out by police.
	   Sergei Yemtsov, 44, and Alexei Shkryabin, 19, were arrested the
next day.
	   Yemtsov, a businessman, told the court he had decided to kidnap
the Mormons in order to repay a dlrs 100,000 debt.
	   ``I would have never committed this crime except for financial
pressure,'' he said during the trial, according to the business
daily Kommersant.
	   The court on Monday sentenced him to four years in prison. His
accomplice Shkryabin got a suspended sentence, since the court
found that he had been unaware of Yemtsov's intentions until the
moment of the abduction.
	   The two missionaries weren't seriously hurt and were reassigned
to Mormon missions elsewhere. But they returned to Russia briefly
to testify in the trial.

Malaysian opposition lawmaker sent to prison on sedition charges
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with comment; Lim going to prison

 &UR; By JOCELYN GECKER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ An opposition member of Parliament
was led to prison in handcuffs Tuesday after a federal court upheld
his sentence on charges of sedition for having criticized the
Malaysian judiciary.
	   Lim Guan Eng, deputy secretary-general of the Democratic Action
Party and a member of Parliament for 12 years, became the first
sitting Malaysian legislator to be sent to prison.
	   If forced to serve his full term, Lim will lose his seat in
Parliament. Under Malaysian law, a lawmaker must relinquish his
seat if he serves more than 12 months in prison.
	   ``My political career may have terminated, but my political
struggle will go on,'' Lim told reporters before being led off to
prison. ``I will hold the handcuffs that will be placed upon me not
as a symbol of shame, but as a symbol of pride.''
	   Lim, 38, was convicted last year of sedition and printing false
news in a pamphlet distributed in 1995 entitled, ``The True
Story.''
	   In it, he criticized the government's decision not to press
statutory rape charges against Abdul Rahim Tamby Chik, a former
chief minister of Lim's home state, Malacca.
	   The pamphlet questioned why the 15-year-old girl involved in the
scandal was detained for more than two years, but not Abdul Rahim,
a leading member of the ruling United Malays National Organization.
	   Prosecutors at the time said they didn't have enough evidence
against Abdul Rahim, although he was suspended by UMNO and earlier
this year lost his bid for a seat.
	   Lim became involved in the case when the girl's grandmother
asked for his help in getting her released from ``protective
custody.''
	   ``I have no regrets in what I did to help the old grandmother
seek justice,'' Lim said, removing his jacket, kissing his DAP
lapel pin and wiping tears from his eyes.
	   ``A rape victim must be protected by police and authorities and
not detained by authorities.''
	   The case was being watched closely by human rights activists.
Representatives of Amnesty International and the International
Commission of Jurists attended the hearing.
	   ``Amnesty International believes that Lim Guan Eng today becomes
a prisoner of conscience solely for expressing his opinion and
fulfilling his duties as a member of Parliament,'' said Amnesty
representative Mark Daly.
	   Daly said the London-based human rights group would begin an
international campaign to seek Lim's release.
	   Earlier in the day, a three-judge panel of the Federal Court,
Malaysia's highest court, upheld a sentence of two, concurrent
18-month prison terms, set by a lower appellate court.
	   ``We would like to say that a member of Parliament should always
act in a responsible manner,'' Chief Justice Eusoffe Chin told the
courtroom in upholding the sentence. ``He should not break the
law.''
	   Lim's original sentence called for a 15,000 ringgit (dlrs 3,570)
fine. It was dismissed and replaced with a jail term by the Court
of Appeal in April, when Lim lost his first appeal.
	   Lim's father, Lim Kit Siang, is the opposition leader in
Parliament and head of the Democratic Action Party.
	   In 1987, both father and son were arrested under the Internal
Security Act, which allows suspects to be held without trial if
deemed a threat to national security. They were held for 18 months
with three other opposition lawmakers.
	   ``My family and I are devastated ... and I am sure the feeling
is shared not only by DAP members but by a large number of
justice-loving Malaysians,'' said the elder Lim.
	   The Lims, members of Parliament for a combined 41 years, believe
that as Malaysia struggles against economic collapse, the
opposition has become a scapegoat.

Yeltsin fills legal limbo, asks current Cabinet to carry on duties
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with ruble's plunge in graf 10, analyst's comment in
final 2 grafs. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin on Tuesday took the nation
out of legal limbo, decreeing that the members of recently ousted
Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko's Cabinet should stay on the job
until replacements are appointed.
	   The acting prime minister Yeltsin named on Sunday, Viktor
Chernomyrdin, meanwhile huddled with his political allies in the
lower house of parliament, the State Duma _ leaders of his Our Home
Is Russia party and the centrist Russia's Regions group. The
parliamentary vote to confirm Chernomyrdin is expected no earlier
than next week.
	   In an interview published Tuesday, Chernomyrdin said he would
try to soften the impact of the country's financial crisis on
ordinary Russians and support ailing industries.
	   ``The protection of social interests will be our first
priority,'' he said in an interview with the daily Komsomolskaya
Pravda. ``The second will be state industrial policy, since we
can't take Russia out of crisis by purely monetary moves.''
	   Critics have said that it was Chernomyrdin's past policy of
unrealistic budgets and continuous support of inefficient
industries that precipitated the current crisis. However, his call
for more support to state industry will certainly win a sympathetic
ear of the Communists and other hardliners in parliament.
	   ``There are many reasonable people in the Duma whose political
support I'm counting on,'' Chernomyrdin was quoted as saying.
	   Yeltsin ousted Chernomyrdin in March and fought hard for his
successor, the young Kiriyenko, to be approved by the
Communist-dominated Duma. At the time, Yeltsin argued that the
country needed ``fresh ideas and unorthodox approaches'' to
overcome its stagnation.
	   However, the economy went into a nose dive shortly after
Kiriyenko's appointment and he spent his short term waging a losing
battle against the intermittent waves of financial crisis.
	   After the government finally surrendered last week, effectively
devaluing the ruble 34 percent despite repeated pledges to avoid
that step, Yeltsin applied his customary tactics of shifting the
blame and ousted Kiriyenko as suddenly as he had previously fired
Chernomyrdin.
	   Chernomyrdin's nomination has failed to stop the ruble's steep
plunge. It fell 0.72 against the U.S. dollar on Tuesday on the
interbank currency exchange controlled by the Central Bank, closing
10 percent down at 7.86 rubles to the dollar.
	   Some Russian media and analysts on Tuesday interpreted the
government shakeup as a sign that Yeltsin's condition had
deteriorated to the point where he might step down any moment.
	   ``It has become quite clear that Russia lacks not only a
government, but a president as well,'' the business daily
Kommersant said in a front-page commentary.
	   The Kremlin insisted that Yeltsin's health was fine, but the
president, who has just returned from a month-long vacation, looked
tired and has had trouble following reporters' questions in his
recent public appearances.
	   ``The current economic crisis signals the end of Yeltsin's
era,'' said Vyacheslav Nikonov, a respected Russian political
analyst who heads the independent Politika think-tank.
	   Nikonov added, however, that prospects for Yeltsin's early
resignation are minimal because ``power is the content of his
life,'' the Interfax news agency said.

Chinese president says flooding will not hurt economy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 13th graf bgng `Jiang spoke ... ' to RESTORE dropped word
`issue' in Jiang quote; picks up 14th graf pvs `The 72-year-old ...
'
 &UR; By WILLIAM E. AHEARN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ President Jiang Zemin said Tuesday that floods
which have devastated vast regions of China will not have a
significant impact on the nation's growing economy.
	   Jiang spoke during a two-hour conversation with current and
former members of the Board of Directors of The Associated Press
and senior AP news executives, led by Chairman of the Board Donald
E. Newhouse and Louis D. Boccardi, president and chief executive
officer of the AP.
	   The Chinese president touched on many topics, including
terrorism, Taiwan, U.S. President Bill Clinton and human rights.
	   But throughout the discussion he frequently returned to the
flooding, interspersing details on the 250 million people displaced
and the size of China's relief efforts with emotional and
philosophical comments on the disaster.
	   He recalled how residents of his hometown of Yangzhou, in
southern China, used tubs as makeshift rafts during floods in 1931,
when he was five.
	   Frequently alluding to his scientific training, he almost
wistfully lamented nature's ability to overwhelm technology:
	   ``We can predict the rainfall, but can't stop it from falling
from the skies,'' he said.
	   In discussing the economic impact of the floods, Jiang said
crops are growing well and life goes on as usual in areas just
beyond the flooding.
	   He said he didn't think the floods would have a significant
negative impact on China's economic growth which is projected at 8
percent, a slight drop from last year's 8.8 percent.
	   ``I hope China will achieve it, but if it is somewhat lower, I
don't think people should be worried,'' he added.
	   He said some areas wiped out by flooding will have to be
rebuilt, and the capital investment required will help stimulate
the economy.
	   The meeting with the AP group, which is on a fact-finding tour
of China, was held at the State Guest House in a large room with a
glass wall overlooking a lake. At one point Jiang interrupted his
comments to point to a trio of swans swimming by.
	   Jiang spoke through an interpreter but occasionally interjected
comments in English. His mood ranged from intense to jovial. He
jabbed his hand toward the ceiling as he talked about Taiwan,
calling it ``an inalienable province of China,'' and ``the most
sensitive issue in China-US relations.''
	   The 72-year-old Jiang, an electrical engineer by training,
frequently referred to his background, but added that he has a deep
interest in literature. He cited Mark Twain, Henry Wadsworth
Longfellow, Confucius and several Chinese poets. He quoted Song
dynasty poet Wang Anshi as saying ``I do not fear that the floating
clouds might obscure my view because I stand at the top of the
mountain.''
	   Asked what advice he would give to President Clinton on his
current ``personal problems,'' Jiang said: ``Frankly, it is very
difficult to answer. It is a personal question for Clinton. But
with the democratic traditions and wisdom of the American people,
I'm sure that in the end people will put the situation in the right
way.''
	   He added, ``Political struggles are very complex. Things are
easier when personal issues are separated from political ones.''
	   In commenting on himself, he recalled that during his visit to
the United States last year some protesters held up signs
describing him as a ``tyrant,'' and the head of a ``dictatorship.''
	   ``I have met quite a lot of other leaders,'' he said, ``and I
don't believe I've given them the impression that I am a tyrant or
a dictator.''
	   On reunification with Taiwan, Jiang said China wants a peaceful
reconciliation but ``the question should not remain unsettled for
too long.''
	   ``Our policy is clear cut. It is a peaceful one on the basis of
one country, two systems'' _ the same formula that was used in the
recovery of Hong Kong.
	   But he reiterated China's right to use force if necessary.
	   ``We do not commit not to use force,'' he said, ``and our
intention in not disavowing the right to use force is directed at
separatists who are promoting independence... .''
	   When asked about the recent terrorist attacks on American
embassies in East Africa, and the U.S. missile attacks that
followed in Afghanistan and the Sudan, Jiang said: ``We are
unequivocally opposed to terrorism in any form.''
	   ``Our viewpoint is consistent. We believe these matters need to
be resolved based on the U.N charter and normal international
law,'' he said. The United States referred in part to the Charter
to justify the attacks.
	   On other topics, Jiang:
	   _Restated China's commitment to keep its currency, the yuan,
stable amid the Asian financial turmoil, while conceding that
policy ``carries a certain price and a certain risk.''
	   _Said that although some ``dark clouds'' have covered U.S.-China
relations since 1993, ``on the whole, both sides are working toward
building a strategic constructive partnership.''
	   _Acknowledged China and the United States sometimes disagree on
human rights but said ``in a democratic atmosphere we can put the
issues on the table and talk on the principle of non-interference
in each other's affairs.''

	   HONG KONG (AP) - Share prices closed higher Tuesday, with the
Hong Kong government showing no indications that it would give up
its intervention in the market.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,
rose 44.61 points, or 0.6 percent, closing at 7,890.09. On Monday,
the index had surged 317.87 points, or 4.2 percent.
	   Turnover amounted to 9.92 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
1.27 billion), little changed from Monday's 9.80 billion Hong Kong
dollars (U.S. dlrs 1.25 billion).
	   Brokers said the index edged up into positive territory in the
last 30 minutes of trading following mild government intervention.
	   The government has propped up share prices in the past seven
consecutive sessions in a bit to crush speculators who have been
betting the market would fall.
	   Government intervention is having a ``stabilizing effect'' on
the stock market, said Miles Remington, sales director at
Socgen-Crosby Securities (HK) Ltd.
	   Among gainers, Cheung Kong rose 50 Hong Kong cents to 34.50, and
Sun Hung Kai Properties rose 35 cents to 26.00.
	   In the banking sector, Hang Seng Bank rose 1.20 dollars to
44.90, and Bank of East Asia rose 20 cents to 8.15. Going against
the trend was HSBC Holdings, which fell 5.50 dollars to 172.50.
	   Elsewhere, China Light rose 80 cents to 35.30, and Swire Pacific
``A'' rose 30 cents to 24.00.

China braces for renewed flooding on Yangtze River
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 10 grafs to UPDATE with spokesman saying deaths
less than 4,000, quotes; picks up 11th graf pvs `While the ... '

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's exhausted flood fighters were ordered to
remain on guard as a new surge of high water barreled down the
Yangtze River on Tuesday, threatening to overwhelm dikes weakened
by a summer of devastating floods.
	   China's flood control headquarters described the situation as
``extremely serious.'' It warned that along a 300-kilometer
(180-kilometer) stretch of the river, water levels stood at
historic highs and some places have been inundated for 60 days or
more.
	   The new Yangtze flood crest _ the seventh so far in a summer of
flooding that has seen thousands killed and millions made homeless
_ was expected to plunge through the Three Gorges Dam and enter the
middle Yangtze Tuesday night.
	   President Jiang Zemin noted the heroic efforts of 2.1 million
civilians and soldiers manning dikes on the Yangtze. But he
predicted that the devastation will not significantly impact
China's economy.
	   In an interview with current and former members of the Board of
Directors of The Associated Press, Jiang also lamented nature's
ability to overwhelm modern technology.
	   ``We can predict the rainfall, but can't stop it from falling
from the skies,'' Jiang said.
	   Flooding is at its worst in 44 years along the Yangtze and in
decades in the northeast. Government spokesman Zhao Qizheng said
Tuesday that deaths have increased but are not expected to surpass
4,000 _ less than double the nearly three-week-old official tally
of 2,000.
	   Given China's population of 1.2 billion and the sheer scale of
the flooding, ``the figure of casualties was very, very small,''
Zhou Wenzhi, vice minister for water resources, said at a news
conference.
	   All efforts were being expended in fighting the floods and so
assessments of deaths and damages were lagging, Zhou explained.
	   Vital dikes that protect major industrial centers and rich
farmland are ``once again facing a serious test,'' the flood
control headquarters said.
	   While the flood crest was not expected to reach the highs of
those that preceded it, flood fighters were told to prepare.
	   ``Persevere and persevere again to win the climatic battle in
the fight against floods,'' the Communist Party newspaper People's
Daily exhorted.
	   Hubei, a central province among the most badly flooded, was
concentrating troops along dikes that threatened to give way, the
People's Daily said.
	   Officials ordered that lighting and telephones be set up along
endangered dikes and stocks of sand, stone and sacks for sandbags
be prepared, the newspaper reported.
	   Nearly 20,000 medical teams with 130,000 people were working in
flood-hit areas to prevent the spread of diseases and to distribute
medicines.
	   Manufacturers of life jackets, bottled drinking water, medicines
and fast food were asked to work overtime to provide supplies for
flood victims, the official Xinhua News Agency said.
	   Meanwhile, the government worked to prevent the misuse or theft
of relief funds and donations. Hubei's government fired officials
who embezzled 2,000 yuan (dlrs 240) or more in relief money, Xinhua
said.

Researcher with five missing diary pages holds them hostage

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ In the dry, bookish world of World
War II research, it's the closest thing to a hostage standoff.
	   A former employee of the Anne Frank Foundation who has five
missing pages to ``The Diary of Anne Frank'' says he'll give them
back _ but only if fellow Dutch scholars promote his Holocaust
research in the United States.
	   Cor Suijk's threats of academic blackmail in a television
interview Monday evening have upset the Netherlands State Institute
for War Documentation, which revealed the existence of the missing
pages last week.
	   ``We've asked a lawyer to try to find a way out of this,'' David
Barnouw, spokesman for the war documentation center, said Tuesday.
	   ``I'm a little surprised,'' he added.
	   Suijk claims that Otto Frank, father of the young Jewish diarist
whose account of hiding from the Nazis has become an international
best-seller in 55 languages, gave him the pages shortly before his
death in 1980.
	   Suijk, a longtime Anne Frank Foundation employee known to have
been a close personal friend and confidante of Otto Frank, told RTL
television Monday that the elder Frank made him promise the pages
wouldn't be published until the entire family was dead.
	   The war documentation center, which wants the pages back so they
can be included in the next edition of Anne's famed diary, contends
that Otto Frank never intended to make a gift of them to Suijk.
	   The center, citing the diary copyright held by the Basel,
Switzerland-based Anne Frank Fund, will say only that the
handwritten pages appear to be authentic and contain Anne's ``very
critical'' assessment of her parents' marriage.
	   Suijk, however, said their contents will be revealed Sept. 14 in
Dutch documentary about Anne's two years in hiding in a secret
annex behind a movable bookcase in an Amsterdam canal house.
	   Suijk told RTL he was willing to part with the pages, but only
if the war documentation center agrees to support his own
independent research into the Holocaust and promote it in America.
	   The revelation that there are pages missing from Anne's diary
has startled scholars who have spent decades researching her life
and were convinced they'd published the complete journal.
	   It trails off in August 1944, just before the Franks were
betrayed and Anne was arrested and hauled off to the Bergen-Belsen
concentration camp. Starving and freezing, Anne died there of
typhoid in the spring of 1945, just weeks before the camp was
liberated.
	   Her diary, a modern literary classic that has become required
reading in schools worldwide, has inspired numerous books, films
and a hit Broadway play.

Government considers drug proposal despite critics
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australia's government is considering a
proposal which could land sport drug cheats in jail, despite
criticism from lawyers and civil liberty groups.
	   The Australian Olympic Committee on Monday called for
governments to raise the penalties for sports drug possession,
manufacturing and trafficking to match penalties applying to
narcotics. A positive drug test for anabolic steroids could land an
athlete a two-year jail term, while anyone importing large amounts
of sports drugs could be jailed for life.
	   Federal Justice Minister Amanda Vanstone said the government was
already considering a proposal for performance-enhancing drugs to
carry the same penalties as illegal narcotics and amphetamines.
	   ``The commonwealth, states and territories have been working
together on this issue for some time,'' Senator Vanstone said.
	   Australian Civil Liberties Council President Terry O'Gorman
described the AOC's proposal as strange.
	   ``The ordinary criminal law of the land in relation to
possession is moving away from the criminal law punitive model
towards a health model,'' O'Gorman said. ``It's a bizarre
proposition for the AOC to go in completely the opposition
direction to which the ordinary criminal law is heading in relation
to possession.''
	   Australian sports lawyer Dennis Boucher said jailing athletes
caught using anabolic steroids would be unworkable.
	   ``What happens about the person who's deliberately spiked?''
Boucher said.
	   ``It's like the race horse who's nobbled. Is it the owner's
fault or is it the crook's?''
	   But Boucher said he saw merit in coming down harder on
traffickers of hard sports drugs.
	   AOC president John Coates said the current criminal penalties
were inadequate when there was evidence the non-medical use of
anabolic steroid abuse had outstripped that of heroin or cocaine in
the general community.
	   Boucher said he had an open mind regarding tougher penalties for
the distributors of hard sports drugs.
	   ``I think there is some benefit in (tougher penalties), not so
much because of the fact that the people they're giving it to might
be involved in cheating, but rather because of the long-term health
effects,'' Boucher said.
	   ``I would suggest that in every gymnasium in the major cities in
Australia, there is a person in that gymnasium, or who regularly
attends that gymnasium, who is offering drugs. It's rife.''

Japan's LTCB announces bad debts; Obuchi defends bailout
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS with LTCB announcing internal audit; UPDATES with
politician protesting retirement bonus in 10th-11th grafs &QL; 
 &UR; By TODD ZAUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ In an effort to win support for a government
bailout, the ailing Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. on Tuesday
disclosed the results of an in-house evaluation of its loans.
	   The bank said it had no bad debt, but that some 15 percent of
its loans were ``likely to go bad'' or ``required monitoring.''
	   Long-Term Credit Bank last week announced a major restructuring
plan and asked for public funds to help write off some 750 billion
yen (dlrs 5.3 billion) in problem debt.
	   The plan has met harsh criticism for its use of public money.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi on Tuesday defended the
government-backed rescue plan for Long-Term Credit Bank against
scathing criticism by opposition parties.
	   Eijiro Hata, a senior politician in the main opposition
Democratic Party, said the government hadn't proved that LTCB
wasn't bankrupt, and it was therefore improper to spend government
money on it.
	   ``The government needs to clearly explain to the public why LTCB
needs public money,'' he said, accusing the government of trying to
prop up defunct banks.
	   Obuchi told Parliament that LTCB's internal assessment was that
its debts didn't exceed assets as of the fiscal year-end last March
31, and that a Bank of Japan study hadn't found it was insolvent
either.
	   He also said the public funds for LTCB weren't intended to help
an individual bank or protect it against bankruptcy, but to
preserve the stability of the overall financial system.
	   But even some members of Obuchi's own party were critical of the
plan.
	   The party's General Council Chairman, Takashi Fukaya, on Tuesday
demanded that retiring LTCB executives forfeit their retirement
bonuses, saying it is wrong for the bank to pay big allowances
while it receives a public bailout.
	   Announcing the results of its own loan audit, LTCB said 15.91
trillion yen (dlrs 110.5 billion) of ``sound'' loans, 2.38 trillion
yen (dlrs 16.5 billion) in loans that ``require monitoring,'' 444.4
billion yen (dlrs 3.1 billion) in loans which were ``likely to go
bad.'' It said it had no bad loans.
	   The Financial Supervisory Agency, Japan's bank watchdog, is also
inspecting LTCB's books and may come up with different figures,
although it has already expressed support for the rescue merger.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Facing American pressure to crack down on
copyright violations, customs officers detained five men Tuesday
and seized 200,000 pirated compact discs valued at 4 million Hong
Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 512,820).
	   A government statement gave no other details of the raid on the
discs storage center or the suspects, but said they were helping
officials in their investigation.
	   Hong Kong has come under international pressure to do a better
job of protecting intellectual property. U.S. officials say the
territory has become a production and distribution center for
pirated discs since mainland China began cracking down on copyright
piracy.
	   Early this year, U.S. officials decided to keep Hong Kong on a
watch list for copyright violation.
	   Despite frequent raids, stores selling pirated compact discs or
CD-ROMs still thrive in busy shopping centers in the territory.
Copies of local or Hollywood movies are widely available for under
40 Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 5), sometimes before they're
released in local cinemas.
	   In April, officers of Hong Kong's anti-corruption agency seized
7 million pirated video discs and production equipment worth U.S.
dlrs 83 million, the biggest such seizure in Hong Kong's history.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand told the International
Monetary Fund on Tuesday that the economy in 1998 will shrink even
more than previously forecast, contracting an estimated 7 percent.
	   The forecasts were part of a letter of intent to the IMF
approved Tuesday by Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai's Cabinet to
govern the fifth quarter of the IMF's dlrs 17.2 billion program to
rescue the Thai economy.
	   The targets are in line with talks between Thai and IMF
officials in Bangkok earlier this month and confirm that Thailand's
economy, the first to sink in the wave of crises hitting Asia since
mid-1997, will suffer still more.
	   Gross domestic product is expected to decline 7 percent in 1998,
followed by a recovery in growth in 1999, the statement said.
	   ``The economy will bottom towards the end of the year, setting
the stage for a modest recovery of growth in 1999,'' the statement
said.
	   The letter of intent comes before the IMF board Sept. 10.
	   The increasing severity of Thailand's recession and the costs of
a government program to assist in recapitalization of financial
institutions has led to a higher public sector deficit.
	   Thailand's GDP shrank by 0.4 percent in 1997, and the projected
contraction this year has worsened with each quarter. In the last
letter of intent, estimates were 4 percent to 5.5 percent
shrinkage.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Daewoo Electronics Co. said Tuesday it
has won a dlrs 50 million contract to export 300,000 television
sets to Egypt.
	   The South Korean firm said it will provide television sets in
five different sizes to Egypt's state-run El Nasr for TV and

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Hurt by an economic slump at home and elsewhere in
Asia, Japan's three largest automakers said Tuesday domestic sales
and exports fell markedly in July from a year earlier.
	   Toyota Motor Corp., the nation's largest carmaker, said domestic
sales declined 6.6 percent to 174,628 cars in July from the same
month last year. Exports of Japanese-made cars overseas dropped 8.8
percent to 128,721.
	   At No. 2 carmaker Nissan Motor Co., sales in Japan fell 9.3
percent to 95,078 automobiles, and exports were down 3.1 percent to
67,077.
	   Honda Motor Co. said sales in the home market tumbled 9.8
percent to 58,767 cars. Exports, which make up a large part of the
company's sales, dropped 13.3 percent to 41,086.
	   On a more upbeat note, Honda said production of cars outside
Japan jumped 12.2 percent in July to 97,000, and Toyota said its
overseas production rose by 8.9 percent to 125,329 cars.
	   Nissan said overseas production fell 18.9 percent to 73,217.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ China is still aiming for an 8 percent gross
domestic product growth this year, but President Jiang Zemin warned
on Tuesday that it could fall short of the goal.
	   ``If it is somewhat lower, I don't think people should be
worried,'' Jiang told The Associated Press. ``The highest growth
rate is not necessarily the best.''
	   Jiang added that this year's natural disasters and floods will
have ``no serious impact'' on China's economic growth.
	   In fact, he saw a kind of silver lining in the floods.
	   ``This is an example of how a serious disaster can turn into a
kind of good,'' he said, pointing out that reconstruction would
require ``considerable capital investment'' on major projects,
which would in turn help stimulate the economy.
	   In a wide-ranging, two-hour meeting with present and former
members of the AP Board of Directors and senior AP news executives,
Jiang passionately described the ravages of the floods and their
impact on the Chinese population.
	   But he also pointed out that in areas not directly affected by
the floods, ``the crops are growing...and people are going about
their business as usual.''
	   Jiang restated China's commitment to keep its currency, the
yuan, stable while conceding that ``it carries a certain price and
a certain risk.''

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Mitsubishi Electric Corp. and Lockheed
Martin Corp. of the United States have agreed to jointly develop
military equipment, a Mitsubishi spokesman said Tuesday.
	   Katsuyuki Hashimoto, of Tokyo-based Mitsubishi, said his company
and Lockheed reached a ``basic agreement'' recently for a broad
tie-up.
	   ``This is the first comprehensive accord between the two
companies,'' Hashimoto said, though he added they have supplied
each other with some parts in the past.
	   Hashimoto said concrete details of the military equipment to be
jointly developed will be worked out later with Lockheed, the
largest defense contractor in the United States. The company is
based in Bethesda, Maryland.
	   Mitsubishi, sold about 130 billion yen (dlrs 903 million) worth
of equipment to the Defense Agency last year and ranked as the
third-largest defense contractor in Japan, the company said.
	   The Nihon Keizai newspaper reported Tuesday that the agreement
will include cooperation in missile-mounted electronic devices and
weapons-control systems, electronic war systems and radar devices
mounted on aircraft and ships.
	   It said they will initially develop missile-guidance equipment.
	   In addition to exchanging technologies and marketing data,
Mitsubishi and Lockheed will jointly propose new products to
Japan's Defense Agency, the newspaper said.

 &UR; Netanyahu promises to expand Jewish settlements in Hebron &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Netanyahu visit to Hebron, details on settlement
construction; changes bylines &QL; 
 &UR; By NASSER SHIYOUKHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank, (AP) - Even as a peace deal with the
Palestinians appeared closer at hand, Prime Minister Benjamin on
Tuesday paid a surprise visit to Jewish settlers in this tense
Palestinian town and promised to expand their community.
	   Netanyahu's gesture was aimed at his hardline critics, including
many settler leaders, who have demanded that Israel break off
negotiations with the Palestinians following the killing of a
well-known Hebron rabbi, apparently by a Palestinian, last week.
	   Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat reportedly have
softened their positions on an Israeli troop withdrawal in the West
Bank after a 17-month stalemate, though both sides said Tuesday
that several issues remained unresolved.
	   The progress made in recent days apparently was not sufficient
to persuade U.S. Mideast peace envoy Dennis Ross to return to the
region to try and finalize a deal.
	   In an unannounced condolence visit to Hebron on Tuesday,
Netanyahu said he would build new homes for the 450 Jews living in
the divided city of 130,000 Palestinians.
	   ``I care. I want them (settlers) to have security and permanency
and expansion and they deserve it,'' Netanyahu said.
	   He said proposals to build permanent housing in the Jewish
enclave of Tel Romeida, a small trailer park where the rabbi was
killed last week, were submitted for approval Tuesday.
	   Netanyahu also approved the construction of an apartment
building for settlers next to the enclave of Beit Hadassah, the
Yediot Ahronot daily said. Land next to Beit Hadassah was recently
cleared for construction.
	   Finance Minister Yaakov Neeman, meanwhile, has set aside 10
million shekels (drls 2.7 million) for Tel Romeida construction,
and on Monday parliament's Finance Ministry approved an additional
90 million shekels (dlrs 24.2 million) for settlement expansion
throughout the West Bank.
	   The United States offered a proposal in January for an Israeli
withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank, in exchange for
Palestinian security gestures. The Palestinians accepted the
proposal but Israel did not and the sides have been haggling since.
	   On Monday, Arafat said new Israeli ideas submitted in recent
days were ``a beginning'' and that he would accept an Israeli
formula to turn part of the land slated for withdrawal into a
nature reserve where Palestinians would not be allowed to settle.
	   However, Palestinian Information Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo said
Tuesday the Palestinians sought clarifications about the extent of
control the Palestinians would have over the nature reserve.
	   Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh also said sticking points
remained and denied reports that Israel had dropped a major demand
_ its insistence that the 545-member Palestine National Council
convene to amend the PLO charter calling for Israel's destruction.
	   ``Israel is definitely not bending. There won't be an agreement
until all components are accepted,'' Naveh told Israel radio.
	   Palestinians have maintained the PNC already took action to
revoke the charter.
	   A senior Israeli official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said that Israel told U.S. negotiators that it would now agree to
start the withdrawal process if the Palestinians promised to change
the charter within four months of phased pullbacks.
	   Israeli radio also reported that CIA representatives and
Palestinian security officials have begun drawing up a new security
memorandum on fighting terrorism.
	   Israel has said that no deal could be completed unless they
received assurances from the Palestinian Authority on combating
militants.
	   Officials were hoping a deal could be wrapped up before Sept.
13, the anniversary of the historic Israeli-Palestinian peace
accords first signed five years ago, the Haaretz daily said.

Australian sprinter takes case to court
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian sprinter Nova Peris-Kneebone
will take Athletics Australia (AA) to court to appeal against her
omission from the 100-meter event at next month's Commonwealth
Games.
	   Last week, Peris-Kneebone was given the honor of being the first
Australian to carry the Olympic torch when it arrives here in June
2000.
	   She became Australia's first Aboriginal Olympic gold medalist
when a member of the women's field hockey team at the 1996 Atlanta
Olympics but switched to track and field after those games.
	   Peris-Kneebone will dispute AA's selection criteria at the Court
of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), an independent body which provides
rulings on disputes involving athletes.
	   The CAS will hold a directions hearing Thursday and a full
hearing is expected to take place in Melbourne next week.
	   Peris-Kneebone, who is in the Australia 4x100-meter relay team,
met the 100-meter qualifying standard in March with a time of 11.42
seconds. She could only manage third at the Commonwealth Games
trials in 11.95 earlier this month behind Lauren Hewitt (11.69) and
Tania Van Heer (11.84), who were both chosen along with Melinda
Gainsford-Taylor, who was pre-qualified. Van Heer has not recorded
a time under the qualifying standard but was selected on the basis
of her second placing at the trial.
	   ``I believe I have satisfied the criteria and that I am
qualified and eligible for selection in the 100-meter event,''
Peris-Kneebone said. ``I have had my claim professionally assessed
and I believe that I deserve to be selected in the sprint team on
merit.''
	   She said the CAS action should not be construed as an indication
of disharmony in the Australian team.
	   ``My appeal is lodged simply because I believe that I am worthy
and deserving of selection,'' Peris-Kneebone said.

Yeltsin and Vietnam's Luong pledge to restore Soviet-era
</HEADLINE>
partnership &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Meeting in the Kremlin, President Boris Yeltsin
and his visiting Vietnamese counterpart Tran Duc Luong pledged
Tuesday to rebuild their countries' Soviet-era alliance.
	   ``As a minimum, we should restore our past relations,
concentrating on the oil and gas complex,'' Yeltsin told reporters
after the talks.
	   Economic and military ties between Russia and Vietnam had
loosened in the final years before the 1991 Soviet collapse as
Moscow gave up support of its former satellite. Russia has
continued to help Vietnam run its offshore oil fields, but the
level of cooperation was markedly down from the past.
	   Yeltsin and Luong said in a joint statement that the two
countries would boost joint oil production to 15-16 million tons a
year and also build Vietnam's first oil refinery, which would be
capable of processing 6.5 million tons of crude a year, Russian
news reports said.
	   The statement also said that Russia would help build power
plants in Vietnam and develop other industries. The two leaders
also discussed military cooperation, pledging that it would not be
``directed against any third country and wouldn't tilt the balance
of power in the region.''
	   Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev will visit Vietnam in the
next few months to discuss military cooperation. Yeltsin accepted
an invitation to visit Vietnam some time next year.
	   ``There are far fewer problems than I thought'' in
Russian-Vietnamese relations, Yeltsin said following the talks.
``The foundation built by our two countries has remained.''

Singapore's first satellite scheduled for launch Wednesday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's first satellite is scheduled for
launch from French Guiana on Wednesday, according to officials from
the city-state's national telephone operator and the aerospace
company placing it in orbit.
	   The U.S. dlrs 240 million ST-1 satellite is jointly owned by
Singapore Telecom and Taiwan's Chunghwa Telecom. Built by
Anglo-French firm Matra Marconi Space, it will provide
telecommunication and broadcast capabilities with a footprint
across all of Asia and part of the Mideast.
	   The company said the satellite will make Singapore Telecom ``a
full telecommunications service provider.''
	   The satellite will have a lifespan of about 12 years, and its
use will be leased to other operators, said Tham Yim Kheng, a
SingTel spokeswoman.
	   European consortium Arianespace is expected to launch ST-1 with
an Ariane 4 rocket between 8:07 and 9:03 p.m. (2307 and 0003 GMT)
from Kourou, French Guiana on Wednesday, said a spokeswoman from
the French-based aerospace operator.
	   The 3.2 ton (2.9 metric ton) satellite will be placed in orbit
at an altitude 22,300 miles (36,000 kilometers), Arianespace said.

Warne on target for Ashes series
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Star spinner Shane Warne is on
target to return from injury in time to spearhead Australia's Ashes
defense against England this year.
	   Shaun Graf, a spokesman for Warne's state team Victoria, said
the leg spinner could be back in the first Sheffield Shield match
on Oct. 21.
	   Warne had shoulder surgery in May and there were fears he might
be sidelined for up to two years. England's hopes of winning the
five-test series starting Nov. 20 received a big boost with news of
Warne's injury, such is his importance to the Australian attack.
	   ``We're certainly trying to set that as his first game,'' Graf
said of the opening Shield match. ``If he can make it back by then,
that would be a bonus.
	   ``But we have got another game after that against New South
Wales in early November (and) that's most probably the more
realistic one that we'd be looking at because that gives him an
opportunity to still prepare himself for the first test.''
	   Warne is Australia's second greatest wicket-taker with 313
victims in 67 tests. He will miss the Commonwealth Games tournament
in Malaysia starting on Sept. 9 and also Australia's tour of
Pakistan, starting late next month.
	   Warne had surgery after returning from Australia's tour of India
and Sharjah that ended in April.
	   Constant pain and the subcontinent's low, slow-turning wickets
nullified his influence in India and on return he declared he was
not even a certain starter for Australia's tour to the West Indies
next February.

 &UR; Netanyahu promises to expand Jewish settlements in Hebron &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Netanyahu visit to Hebron, details on settlement
construction; changes bylines. No pick up &QL; 
 &UR; By NASSER SHIYOUKHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Even as a peace deal with the
Palestinians appeared closer at hand, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu Tuesday paid a surprise visit to Jewish settlers in this
tense Palestinian town and promised to expand their community.
	   Netanyahu's gesture was aimed at his hardline critics, including
many settler leaders, who have demanded that Israel break off
negotiations with the Palestinians following the killing of a
well-known Hebron rabbi, apparently by a Palestinian, last week.
	   Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat reportedly have
softened their positions on an Israeli troop withdrawal in the West
Bank after a 17-month stalemate, though both sides said Tuesday
that several issues remained unresolved.
	   The progress made in recent days apparently was not sufficient
to persuade U.S. Mideast peace envoy Dennis Ross to return to the
region.
	   In an unannounced condolence visit to Hebron on Tuesday,
Netanyahu said he would build new homes for the 450 Jews living in
the divided city of 130,000 Palestinians.
	   ``I care. I want them (settlers) to have security and permanency
and expansion and they deserve it,'' Netanyahu said.
	   He said proposals to build permanent housing in the Jewish
enclave of Tel Romeida, a small trailer park where the rabbi was
killed last week, were submitted for approval Tuesday.
	   Netanyahu also approved the construction of an apartment
building for settlers next to the enclave of Beit Hadassah, the
Yediot Ahronot daily said. Land next to Beit Hadassah was recently
cleared for construction.
	   Finance Minister Yaakov Neeman, meanwhile, has set aside 10
million shekels (drls 2.7 million) for Tel Romeida construction,
and on Monday parliament's Finance Ministry approved an additional
90 million shekels (dlrs 24.2 million) for settlement expansion
throughout the West Bank.
	   The United States offered a proposal in January for an Israeli
withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank, in exchange for
Palestinian security gestures. The Palestinians accepted the
proposal but Israel did not and the sides have been haggling since.
	   On Monday, Arafat said new Israeli ideas submitted in recent
days were ``a beginning'' and that he would accept an Israeli
formula to turn part of the land slated for withdrawal into a
nature reserve where Palestinians would not be allowed to settle.
	   However, Palestinian Information Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo said
Tuesday the Palestinians sought clarifications about the extent of
control the Palestinians would have over the nature reserve.
	   Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh also said sticking points
remained and denied reports that Israel had dropped a major demand
_ its insistence that the 545-member Palestine National Council
convene to amend the PLO charter calling for Israel's destruction.
	   ``Israel is definitely not bending. There won't be an agreement
until all components are accepted,'' Naveh told Israel radio.
	   Palestinians have maintained the PNC already took action to
revoke the charter.
	   A senior Israeli official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said that Israel told U.S. negotiators that it would now agree to
start the withdrawal process if the Palestinians promised to change
the charter within four months of phased pullbacks.
	   Israeli radio also reported that CIA representatives and
Palestinian security officials have begun drawing up a new security
memorandum on fighting terrorism.
	   Israel has said that no deal could be completed unless they
received assurances from the Palestinian Authority on combating
militants.
	   Officials were hoping a deal could be wrapped up before Sept.
13, the anniversary of the historic Israeli-Palestinian peace
accords first signed five years ago, the Haaretz daily said.

Singapore prime minister moves to proclaim opponent bankrupt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong is
taking steps to proclaim a veteran opposition politician bankrupt
after he failed to pay defamation damages and refused to apologize,
Singapore TV reported Tuesday.
	   Goh earlier this month has offered to waive the 100,000
Singapore dollars (dlrs 57,000) damages from a defamation lawsuit
against J.B. Jeyaretnam, if the he issued an acceptable apology by
Friday.
	   Jeyaretnam, who earlier said he is unable to pay the damages,
did not apologize on Goh's terms by that deadline. The deadline for
the payment of damages expired Monday.
	   ``The prime minister is now leaving bankruptcy proceedings to
his lawyers,'' the government-controlled TV reported.
	   Under Singapore law, Jeyaretnam will lose his place in
Parliament if proclaimed bankrupt. He is one of only three
opposition members in the 84-seat Parliament.
	   A Singapore court ruled last year that Jeyaretnam had defamed
Goh at a Dec. 31 1996 election rally when he stated that one of his
fellow candidates had filed a police report against the prime
minister, accusing him of criminal conspiracy and lying.
	   Those facts were accurate, but the lower court ruled they
contained defamatory innuendo. The Court of Appeal added that they
were said in malice, and increased the damages to Goh by five
times.
	   Goh's lawyers said last week that Jeyaretnam does not want to
apologize in terms of the Court of Appeal ruling.
	   The lower court had found Jeyaretnam guilty only of ``acting
recklessly.''
	   The opposition Worker's Party leader said last week that he has
``offered to apologize ... sincerely and unreservedly for the hurt
caused ... and thanking him for his act of statesmanship'' in
waiving the damages.
	   In addition to damages, Jeyaretnam also stands to pay about
150,000 Singapore dollars (dlrs 88,000) in court costs.
	   The case was part of this year's U.S. State Department Human
Rights Report, which said the Singapore government uses legal
processes such as libel and defamation lawsuits to stifle freedom
of speech and intimidate the political opposition.

Israeli helicopters attack vehicle in south Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli helicopter gunships rocketed a
vehicle and set it ablaze near this southern port city on Tuesday,
security officials said.
	   There was no immediate word on casualties from the attack, which
occurred at 12:30 p.m. (0930GMT) on a road about 12 kilometers (7.5
miles) south of Tyre.
	   Two helicopter gunships took part in the raid and one fired a
single rocket that gutted the vehicle, said the Lebanese officials,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   There were no further details on the vehicle's occupants and
whether it was moving or parked. Israel had no immediate comment.
	   Israel has in the past used such a tactic to hunt down
commanders of Shiite Muslim guerrillas who are waging a war to
dislodge Israel's occupation army from a border zone in southern
Lebanon.
	   In February 1992, Israeli helicopters destroyed a guerrilla
motorcade, killing Sheik Abbas Musawi, the secretary general of the
Shiite Muslim guerrilla movement Hezbollah.
	   Last week, three Israeli soldiers were killed in two separate
attacks by guerrillas in the south.

<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France AP) _ In a move certain to rattle the Boeing
Co., British Airways said Tuesday it will order its first batch of
jets from Europe's Airbus Industrie.
	   Airbus called a news conference with British Prime Minister Tony
Blair and Airbus President Noel Forgeard later Tuesday at its
headquarters in Toulouse, France, to unveil details of the plan.
	   British Airways, in a statement Tuesday morning, said it will
buy 59 short-haul jets in the A320 family, with options to buy
another 129, the airline said in a statement released Tuesday
morning.
	   BA chief executive Bob Ayling acknowledged the deal would
disappoint Boeing.
	   ``I know Boeing, being the company they are, will come back,''
Ayling told reporters in Toulouse before the news conference.
	   Asked if he thought choosing a European supplier would help BA
get European Union approval for its controversial alliance with
American Airlines, Ayling indicated the decision was purely
commercial.
	   ``I don't think it will make any difference,'' said Ayling.
``British Airways bought these aircraft because they offered us the
best value.''

	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ A Greek-registered oil tanker was
stranded Tuesday in Istanbul's Bosporus Strait by a mechanical
problem, port officials said.
	   No leak was reported from the 140,872 metric tons (154,000 short
tons) of crude oil being shipped from Russia to Italy in the
Crudegulf tanker, officials said.
	   The nature of the mechanical problem wasn't immediately known.
	   The tanker was attempting maneuvers to free itself at the
southern entrance to the narrow waterway.
	   Turkish activists regularly stage protests pointing out the
dangers of heavy tanker traffic in strait, which cuts through this
city of about 10 million people.

Chinese president says flooding will not hurt economy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 4th graf to CORRECT to 250 million people affected, sted
displaced; picks up 5th graf pvs `He recalled ... '
 &UR; By WILLIAM E. AHEARN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ President Jiang Zemin said Tuesday that floods
which have devastated vast regions of China will not have a
significant impact on the nation's growing economy.
	   Jiang spoke during a two-hour conversation with current and
former members of the Board of Directors of The Associated Press
and senior AP news executives, led by Chairman of the Board Donald
E. Newhouse and Louis D. Boccardi, president and chief executive
officer of the AP.
	   The Chinese president touched on many topics, including
terrorism, Taiwan, President Clinton and human rights.
	   But throughout the discussion he frequently returned to the
flooding, interspersing details on the 250 million people the
disaster has affected and the size of China's relief efforts with
emotional and philosophical comments on the calamity.
	   He recalled how residents of his hometown of Yangzhou, in
southern China, used tubs as makeshift rafts during floods in 1931,
when he was five.
	   Frequently alluding to his scientific training, he almost
wistfully lamented nature's ability to overwhelm technology:
	   ``We can predict the rainfall, but can't stop it from falling
from the skies,'' he said.
	   In discussing the economic impact of the floods, Jiang said
crops are growing well and life goes on as usual in areas just
beyond the flooding.
	   He said he didn't think the floods would have a significant
negative impact on China's economic growth which is projected at 8
percent, a slight drop from last year's 8.8 percent.
	   ``I hope China will achieve it, but if it is somewhat lower, I
don't think people should be worried,'' he added.
	   He said some areas wiped out by flooding will have to be
rebuilt, and the capital investment required will help stimulate
the economy.
	   The meeting with the AP group, which is on a fact-finding tour
of China, was held at the State Guest House in a large room with a
glass wall overlooking a lake. At one point Jiang interrupted his
comments to point to a trio of swans swimming by.
	   Jiang spoke through an interpreter but occasionally interjected
English comments. His mood ranged from intense to jovial. He jabbed
his hand toward the ceiling as he talked about Taiwan, calling it
``an inalienable province of China,'' and ``the most sensitive
issue in China-US relations.''
	   The 72-year-old Jiang, an electrical engineer by training,
frequently referred to his background, but added that he has a deep
interest in literature. He cited Mark Twain, Henry Wadsworth
Longfellow, Confucius and several Chinese poets. He quoted Song
dynasty poet Wang Anshi as saying ``I do not fear that the floating
clouds might obscure my view because I stand at the top of the
mountain.''
	   Asked what advice he would give to U.S. President Bill Clinton
on his current ``personal problems,'' Jiang said: ``Frankly, it is
very difficult to answer. It is a personal question for Clinton.
But with the democratic traditions and wisdom of the American
people, I'm sure that in the end people will put the situation in
the right way.''
	   He added, ``Political struggles are very complex. Things are
easier when personal issues are separated from political ones.''
	   In commenting on himself, he recalled that during his visit to
the United States last year some protesters held up signs
describing him as a ``tyrant'' and the head of a ``dictatorship.''
	   ``I have met quite a lot of other leaders,'' he said, ``and I
don't believe I've given them the impression that I am a tyrant or
a dictator.''
	   On reunification with Taiwan, Jiang said China wants a peaceful
reconciliation but ``the question should not remain unsettled for
too long.''
	   ``Our policy is clear cut. It is a peaceful one on the basis of
one country, two systems'' _ the same formula that was used in the
recovery of Hong Kong.
	   But he reiterated China's right to use force if necessary.
	   ``We do not commit not to use force,'' he said, ``and our
intention in not disavowing the right to use force is directed at
separatists who are promoting independence ... .''
	   When asked about the terrorist strikes at American embassies in
East Africa and the U.S. missile attacks in Afghanistan and the
Sudan, Jiang said: ``We are unequivocally opposed to terrorism in
any form.''
	   ``Our viewpoint is consistent. We believe these matters need to
be resolved based on the U.N. charter and normal international
law,'' he said. The United States referred in part to the Charter
to justify the attacks.
	   On other topics, Jiang:
	   _ Restated China's commitment to keep its currency, the yuan,
stable amid the Asian financial turmoil, while conceding that
policy ``carries a certain price and a certain risk.''
	   _ Said that although some ``dark clouds'' have covered
U.S.-China relations since 1993, ``on the whole, both sides are
working toward building a strategic constructive partnership.''
	   _ Acknowledged China and the United States sometimes disagree on
human rights but said ``in a democratic atmosphere we can put the
issues on the table and talk on the principle of non-interference
in each other's affairs.''

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese aviation authorities said Tuesday they are
investigating a reported near miss between a Japanese commercial
airliner and a U.S. military jet in skies near Tokyo.
	   The pilot of a Japan Airlines DC-10 reported that an
anti-collision system kicked in last Wednesday to avoid a possible
crash, said Masanobu Tokumaru, a safety inspection officer at the
Transport Ministry.
	   Tokumaru said the U.S. military in Japan notified the ministry
that an American F-18 jet was flying nearby at the time. He said
Japanese aviation officials are investigating.
	   U.S. military officials were not immediately available for
comment.
	   Tokumaru said the Japanese carrier was flying at an altitude of
about 5,800 meters (19,024 feet) and ascending, when its pilot
discovered the military jet flying below from right to left at 7:25
a.m. (2225 GMT) Wednesday morning, Tokumaru said.
	   The two planes were flying at different altitudes about 160
meters (525 feet) apart over Sagami city, 40 kilometers (25 miles)
west of Tokyo, Tokumaru quoted the Japanese pilot as reporting to
the ministry Monday.
	   None of the 147 passengers and 10 crew members aboard the DC-10,
which was en route to Hiroshima from Tokyo's Haneda airport, were
injured, Tokumaru said.
	   Japanese civilian pilots have frequently complained of problems
with the flight routes of U.S. military aircraft, and want more
limitations on their flight paths and tighter restrictions on the
type of training missions they can conduct.
	   Also Tuesday, about 120 local government officials from western
Japan gathered in Hiroshima Prefecture (state) to call for an end
to low-altitude U.S. military training flights.
	   Participants said they were concerned about noise and vibration
from the jets and worried about the possibility of a crash, said
Kiyotaka Fujiwara, the mayor of the village of Kimita where the
rally was held.
	   The group of mostly small town mayors agreed they must join
together to urge the central government to ban the flights,
Fujiwara said.
	   U.S. military planes are exempt from rules that require Japanese
warplanes to conduct low-altitude training away from civil aviation
routes.
	   It is also legal for American planes to train at very low
altitudes over populated areas and fly without following
instructions from commercial control towers.
	   About 47,000 U.S. military personnel are stationed in Japan
under mutual security arrangements between the two countries.

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ President Laurent Kabila returned to
Congo's capital Tuesday for the first time in more than a week
after his government and allied African forces began preparing a
new wave of offensives in Congo's east.
	   Kabila's motorcade _ a caravan of black limousines flanked by
pickup trucks filled with commandos _ zipped through Kinshasa's
rutted streets early Tuesday morning.
	   Information Minister Didier Mumengi confirmed Kabila's return.
	   The president had been holed up in the southern city of
Lubumbashi for more than a week while his capital seemed in peril
from an advancing rebel army.
	   But a string of victories by Congolese soldiers and their
Angolan allies in a western corridor that stretches from the
capital, Kinshasa, to the Atlantic Ocean, have put the rebels on
the defensive.
	   ``The Congolese army and our allies are looking for the same
victories in the east,'' Voice of the People radio reported.
	   Angolan forces fighting on behalf of Kabila have captured a
string of important towns, reportedly including the Congo River
port of Matadi _ though rebel officials deny that town has fallen.
	   Rebels fighters _ a coalition of ethnic Tutsi gunmen and
disenchanted members of Kabila's military _ were holed up in the
town of Inga, Angolan radio reported.
	   Inga, about 50 kilometers north of Matadi, is the site of a
major power dam that supplies Kinshasa with electricity.
	   Angolan radio said the rebels were threatening to blow up the
dam.
	   The reports could not be independently confirmed.
	   The rebels in the west are now trapped between Angolan forces in
the southwest and Zimbabwean troops defending Kinshasa's southern
outskirts.
	   In Namibia, newspapers indicated that country may also be
preparing to enter the conflict on the government's behalf.
	   Hundreds of troops and newly outfitted armored vehicles are
being transported north within Namibia, two newspapers reported
Monday.
	   The dailies Die Republikein and The Namibian reported that a
column of about a dozen armored vehicles was moving troops north
toward Zambia and Angola _ both of which border Congo.
	   Such large troop movements are unusual in Namibia, where
military units usually remain stationary.
	   Namibian President Sam Nujoma last week supported a decision by
Zimbabwe, Zambia and Angola to support Kabila's against the
insurrection.
	   In the east, the rebel army is firmly in control of Goma, near
the border with Rwanda and other key cities including Bukavu and
Kisangani.
	   Rwanda _ considered the rebels' main military and political
sponsor _ says it will intervene in the conflict if the Zimbabweans
and Angolans do not withdraw.
	   Rwanda is already believed to be fighting alongside the rebels
and Uganda has also sent troops and tanks in support of the
insurgents.
	   Fighting broke out earlier this month when members of Kabila's
armed forces revolted after the president ordered all Rwandan
troops out of the country.
	   Rwandan troops _ the corps of Kabila's rebel movement that
ousted Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko last _ stayed on in Congo
as part of the national defense force.
	   The government on Monday rejected a cease-fire plan drafted in
South Africa by member states of the Southern African Development
Community.
	   Kabila insists a cease-fire can come only after Rwandan and
Ugandan forces leave Congo. Both countries deny having deployed
troops, but say they will if Zimbabwe and Angola don't withdraw.
	   On Monday, a U.S. envoy trying to mediate an end to the fighting
met in the Angolan capital with President Jose Eduardo dos Santos
and said the talks were ``very positive and constructive.''
	   ``We are looking for a political framework for this to happen,''
Howard Wolpe told reporters in Luanda before leaving for South
Africa, where he said he would continue his efforts. He said he
discussed withdrawal of foreign troops with Dos Santos, but
declined to provide details.
	   Before the Angolans' entry, the Congolese rebels had make
remarkable progress toward Kinshasa in their three-week-old drive
to topple the government. Many of those same rebels helped put
Kabila into power after ousting longtime Zairian dictator Mobutu
Sese Seko last year.
	   Those claims also could not be independently confirmed.

Olympic champion criticizes head coach Talbot
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian Olympic swim champion Susie
O'Neill has launched a stinging attack on national coach Don Talbot
as the team prepares for next month's Commonwealth Games.
	   O'Neill has been quoted in Australian sport's magazine Inside
Sport as calling Talbot rude and insensitive to his swimmers'
feelings.
	   The comments come as the team arrived in Perth Tuesday for a
training camp before the Sept. 11 games in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
	   The report was written by Rosemary Alexander, who was a former
Australian team member under Talbot's control.
	   ``Just once I wish he'd just say 'great swim' and forget what
you didn't do,'' O'Neill is quoted as saying.
	   ``When I won my (Atlanta) Olympic gold it was my seventh event.
It was also the only time that week he didn't tell me after a race
that I could have done better. He should know that I don't find any
of that stuff motivating.''
	   O'Neill's manager Rob Woodhouse said the swimmer did not deny
the quotes attributed to her but questioned the context in which
they were asked and the motives of former Olympic swimmer
Alexander.
	   ``Don's reverse psychology is very good,'' said Woodhouse. ``He
does have a Masters in psychology.''
	   In the article, O'Neill recalls an explosive ``discussion''
between Talbot and her coach Scott Volkers just months ago after
she lost a 200-meter butterfly title in Europe _ her first defeat
in the event in four years.
	   ``He yelled at Scott about me _ on and on and on about how every
race I've had in the last four years has been too easy, and now
that's caught up with me, and I won't win again unless I improve
things he pointed out,'' she said.
	   ``If it was a normal conversation I might have listened, but
this was ridiculous. I feel sorry for the coaches, because I think
they often cop this sort of stuff from him. I couldn't put up with
it all the time - it's so rude.''
	   Woodhouse said Talbot was aware of the article and was ``taking
it on the chin''.
	   ``From what Don's saying, he doesn't have anything against Susie
nor any of the comments she makes,'' Woodhouse said.
	   Alexander, who swam before marriage as Rosemary Brown, describes
Talbot in the article as a ``prickly individual, diminutive in
stature but with a giant temper.
	   ``Shattered victims of Talbot's histrionics litter the pool
decks and boardrooms of Australian swimming, a kingdom under his
thumb,'' she said.
	   ```I am right, right, right and you are wrong, wrong, wrong'
stabs the message from his viperous harangues, attacks slyly
dressed up in respectable, reasonable clothing as 'discussions',
albeit one-sided.''

 &UR; Angolans, Zimbabweans bomb Kisangani, Kasangulu, rebels say

<TEXT>
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Angolan and Zimbabwean jet fighters
supporting the government of President Laurent Kabila have bombed
rebel-held Kisangani and continue to attack rebels forces southwest
of the capital, Kinshasa, rebels said Tuesday.
	   Bizima Karaha, Kabila's former foreign minister, said Kisangani,
Congo's third largest city which fell to the rebels Sunday, was
attacked early Tuesday.#
	   ``No military objectives were hit, only civilian targets,''
Karaha said. ``They cannot recapture Kisangani, only bomb it from
the air. This is terrorism.''
	   Karaha said the commander of the Zimbabwean Air Force was in
Kinshasa personally issuing orders to Angolan and Zimbabwean
pilots. The claim could not be confirmed independently.
	   Karaha said on Monday the aircraft bombed rebel frontline
positions for an hour at Kasangulu, 30 kilometers (15 miles)
southwest of Kinshasa, before the rebels repelled ground attack
from an Angolan unit.
	   ``All they are doing is sending planes to bomb innocent
civilians. We hold Zimbabwe and Angola responsible,'' he said.
	   ``We are calling upon the international community to stop the
killing,'' he said.
	   Karaha said the air base at Matadi, about 150 kilometers (90
miles) southwest of Kinshasa, was in rebel hands despite government
reports that it had been recaptured.

Yeltsin fills legal limbo, asks current Cabinet to carry on duties
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Yeltsin reportedly accepting Nemtsov's
resignation in new grafs 3-4, Duma speaker's comments in new grafs
12, 17, minor edits throughout. Trims. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin on Tuesday took the nation
out of legal limbo, decreeing that the members of recently ousted
Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko's Cabinet should stay on the job
until replacements are appointed.
	   The acting prime minister Yeltsin named on Sunday, Viktor
Chernomyrdin, meanwhile huddled with his political allies in the
lower house of parliament, the State Duma _ leaders of his Our Home
Is Russia party and the centrist Russia's Regions group. The
parliamentary vote to confirm Chernomyrdin is expected no earlier
than next week.
	   While asking other Cabinet members to stay, Yeltsin on Tuesday
accepted the resignation of former First Deputy Premier Boris
Nemtsov, once seen as a driving force behind economic reforms,
Russian news reports said. The resignation is expected to be
formally announced on Wednesday
	   There would have been little chance for Nemtsov to remain in the
Cabinet because of his long-time efforts to reform natural gas
giant RAO Gazprom, which Chernomyrdin once headed.
	   In an interview published Tuesday, Chernomyrdin said he would
try to soften the impact of the country's financial crisis on
ordinary Russians and support ailing industries.
	   ``The protection of social interests will be our first
priority,'' he said in an interview with the daily Komsomolskaya
Pravda. ``The second will be state industrial policy, since we
can't take Russia out of crisis by purely monetary moves.''
	   Critics have said that it was Chernomyrdin's past policy of
unrealistic budgets and continuous support of inefficient
industries that precipitated the current crisis. However, his call
for more support to state industry will certainly win a sympathetic
ear from the Communists and other hardliners who dominate the Duma.
	   Yeltsin ousted Chernomyrdin in March and fought hard for his
successor, the young Kiriyenko, to be approved by the
Communist-dominated Duma. At the time, Yeltsin argued that the
country needed ``fresh ideas and unorthodox approaches'' to
overcome its stagnation.
	   However, the economy went into a nose dive shortly after
Kiriyenko's appointment and he spent his short term waging a losing
battle against the intermittent waves of financial crisis.
	   After the government finally surrendered last week, effectively
devaluing the ruble 34 percent despite repeated pledges to avoid
that step, Yeltsin applied his customary tactics of shifting the
blame and ousted Kiriyenko as suddenly as he had previously fired
Chernomyrdin.
	   ``Once he liked the young, now he likes heavyweights,'' Duma
speaker Gennady Seleznyov, a Communist, sneered at Yeltsin's Monday
explanation that Russia needed the ``heavyweight'' Chernomyrdin to
handle the crisis.
	   Chernomyrdin's nomination has failed to stop the ruble's steep
plunge. It fell 0.72 against the U.S. dollar on Tuesday on the
interbank currency exchange controlled by the Central Bank, closing
10 percent down at 7.86 rubles to the dollar.
	   Many Russian politicians and the media on Tuesday interpreted
the government shakeup as a sign that Yeltsin's health had
deteriorated to the point where he might step down any moment.
	   ``It has become quite clear that Russia lacks not only a
government, but a president as well,'' the business daily
Kommersant said in a front-page commentary.
	   The Kremlin insisted that Yeltsin's health was fine, but the
president, who has just returned from a month-long vacation, looked
tired and has had trouble following reporters' questions in his
recent public appearances.
	   Analysts said, however, that even though Yeltsin's position has
weakened, the president can't be expected to give up power.
	   ``The current economic crisis signals the end of Yeltsin's
era,'' said Vyacheslav Nikonov, a respected Russian political
analyst who heads the independent Politika think-tank.

Philippines shares continue to slide, peso ends lower
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with peso ending lower because of yen decline

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine shares ended lower Tuesday
reflecting weakness in the Hong Kong market in morning trading and
in the Japanese yen, traders said.
	   Preliminary data showed the 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange
Index closed down 12.92 points, or nearly 1 percent, at 1310.19. On
Monday the index lost 49.49-point, or 3.6 percent, to 1323.11.
	   Tuesday's decline brings the total loss of the main index to
80.74 points, or 5.8 percent, since Friday.
	   The lack of market-moving developments prompted investors to
look to regional currency movements and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index
for direction, said Ian Kane, a trader for Anscor-Hagedorn
Securities Inc.
	   Investors were also unloading Manila shares ahead of Friday's
scheduled release of second quarter economic data, said Kane.
	   Traders said many expect a weak second quarter economic report _
even a possible contraction _ following a lackluster first half
performance by the agricultural sector, a major component of the
economy.
	   The long drought which hit the country resulted in the lowest
agricultural output in 20 years.
	   In morning trading, the Hang Seng Index lost nearly 1 percent,
or 64.81 points, at 7780.67.
	   The peso closed lower against the U.S. dollar, hurt by renewed
weakness of the yen.
	   At the close, the dollar averaged 42.239 pesos on the Philippine
Dealing System, up from Monday's average of 43.173 pesos. The
dollar was last traded at 43.37 pesos.
	   The yen fell to 144.76 yen to the dollar during Tokyo trading
from 144.40 yen on Monday.
	   Traders expect the peso to continue to track the yen's movements
for the rest of the year, noting that the local currency will
remain susceptible to regional developments.
	   Most traders said the central bank can be expected to defend the
peso from extreme lows by raising its overnight borrowing rate, its
main tool in controlling domestic funds that could be used in
speculative attacks against the local currency.

Miners clash with police in eastern Ukrainian city
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Twenty people were injured in an
Independence Day clash between police and miners in the eastern
Ukrainian city of Luhansk, officials said Tuesday.
	   The fight between some 100 striking miners and local Interior
Ministry troops late Monday injured 12 officers and eight miners,
said a spokesman at the Interior Ministry department in Luhansk.
	   The miners had gathered in a city park earlier in the day as
Ukraine was celebrating the seventh anniversary of its
independence, and were preparing to burn an effigy of what they
called a parasite to express their anger over long-delayed wages.
	   Police and Interior Ministry troops arrived at the scene after
receiving an anonymous telephone call that the effigy the
demonstrators wanted to burn contained an explosive device.
	   However, the miners refused to let policemen examine their
artwork and fought back with sticks, metal pipes and bottles as
officers tried to push them aside.
	   Sixteen of the 20 injured people were immediately hospitalized.
Most of them have already been released, the spokesman in Luhansk
said.
	   No further outbreaks of violence were reported in the city, he
added.
	   Ukraine has experienced a steady economic decline since the 1991
Soviet collapse, and the miners are among the hardest-hit. Their
working conditions have sharply deteriorated, while the loss-making
mining industry has to rely on state subsidies for survival.
	   Though they were among the best-paid classes of employees in
Soviet times, miners throughout Ukraine are currently owed more
than dlrs 1 billion in back salaries.

Israeli helicopter strike kills guerrilla in south Lebanon

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Amal official killed; CHANGES
headline. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli helicopter gunships rocketed a
vehicle near this southern port city on Tuesday, killing a military
official of the Shiite Muslim guerrilla group Amal, security
officials said.
	   Wissam al-Amin, 31, was killed and his vehicle gutted when a
single rocket hit at 12:30 p.m. (0930GMT) on the coastal road about
12 kilometers (7.5 miles) south of Tyre, said the Lebanese
officials, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Two helicopter gunships flew in from the sea and attacked the
vehicle, a blue BMW sedan, as it drove in the area, about 15
kilometers (10 miles) north of the Israeli border and only 1.2
kilometers (.7 miles) from a checkpoint of U.N. peacekeepers
deployed in the region.
	   The dead man was identified as an Amal military official in the
south. The pro-Syrian Amal, one of several guerrilla groups
fighting Israeli occupation of the south, is led by Lebanese
Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri.
	   Less than an hour after the attack, Amal activists collected the
body and pieces of flesh from the smoldering car. The vehicle's
twisted hulk was tossed about 10 meters (yards) into the bush on
the side of the road from the impact.
	   Israel has in the past used helicopter gunships to hunt down
commanders of Shiite guerrillas who are waging a war to dislodge
Israel's occupation army from a border zone in southern Lebanon.
	   In February 1992, Israeli helicopters destroyed a guerrilla
motorcade, killing Sheik Abbas Musawi, the secretary general of
Hezbollah, the Shiite movement leading the guerrilla war in the
south.
	   Last week, three Israeli soldiers were killed in two separate
attacks by guerrillas in the south.

Ukrainian premier discusses financial crisis with Chernomyrdin
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian Premier Valery Pustovoitenko on
Tuesday discussed steps to counter Ukraine's and Russia's financial
crisis with his Russian counterpart Viktor Chernomyrdin, an aide
said.
	   In their telephone conversation, the two premiers also talked
about a possible Chernomyrdin visit to Kiev in early September,
Pustovoitenko's spokeswoman Yelena Hubina said. No definite
agreement was reported.
	   The two leaders exchanged information about their countries'
financial markets, the report said.
	   Chernomyrdin was reappointed by President Boris Yeltsin to head
Russia's Cabinet after his predecessor Sergei Kiriyenko failed to
overcome a financial crisis that has caused a major devaluation of
the ruble.
	   The crisis also brought down Ukraine's hryvna currency and
raised fears of an investor exodus from Ukraine's shaky financial
markets and worries about trade with Russia, Ukraine's key economic
partner.
	   Yeltsin and Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma are expected to
focus on the crisis at their Sept. 18-19 summit in the Ukrainian
town of Kharkiv.

Asian stock markets close mixed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) - Asian stock markets closed mixed Tuesday, with
share prices rebounding in Tokyo on the back of overnight gains on
Wall Street.
	   Tokyo's 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 84.57 points, or
0.56 percent, to close above the psychologically important
15,000-point level at 15,072.93. On Monday, the average lost 309.84
points, or 2.03 percent.
	   Stocks gained following the overnight rise on Wall Street, where
the Dow Jones industrial average rose 32.96 points, or 0.4 percent.
	   Traders said they were heartened by the Dow's resilience despite
the ambiguity that still clouds Russia's future. The Nikkei had
plunged Monday after Russian President Boris Yeltsin suddenly fired
his cabinet.
	   In currency trading, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 144.76 yen in
late afternoon trading, up 0.36 yen from late Monday in Tokyo and
above its late New York rate of 143.95 yen overnight.
	   Malaysian shares also closed higher, helped by increasing
stability of Asian currencies and overnight gains on Wall Street.
	   The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's Composite Index rose 6.97
points, or 2.1 percent, to 324.17.
	   Hong Kong shares closed generally higher, with the government
showing no indication that it would give up its intervention in the
market.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of
blue chips, rose 44.61 points, or 0.6 percent, to close at
7,890.09. On Monday, the index had surged 317.87 points, or 4.2
percent.
	   Brokers said the index edged up into positive territory in the
last 30 minutes of trading following mild government intervention.
	   The Hong Kong government has propped up share prices in the past
seven consecutive sessions in a bid to crush speculators who have
been betting the market would fall.
	   Singapore shares closed mixed, with the key index hitting
another 10 1/2 years low. The Straits Times Industrial Index fell
5.99 points, or 0.6 percent, to 911.32.
	   Elsewhere:
	   JAKARTA: Indonesian share prices closed broadly lower. The key
Composite index fell 3.402 points, or 0.9 percent, to 367.143.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed broadly higher. The All
Ordinaries Index rose 25.9 points, or 0.9 percent, to 2,627.7.
	   SEOUL: Share prices closed higher as concerns over global
financial instability eased. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index
rose 5.08 points, or 1.6 percent, to 310.23.
	   TAIPEI: Share prices closed lower, dragged down by lingering
concerns over the global economy and lower corporate earnings
expectations for 1998. The market's key Weighted Stock Price Index
fell 49.42 points, or 0.7 percent, to 6,908.33.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed lower in thin
trading. The NZSE-40 Capital Index fell 12.07 points, or 0.6
percent, to 1,943.70.
	   MANILA: Philippine shares closed lower. The 30-share Philippine
Stock Exchange Index fell 12.92 points, or 0.9 percent, to
1,310.19.
	   BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed slightly lower in thin
trading. The Stock Exchange of Thailand index fell 2.93 points, or
1.2 percent, to 230.22.

Blair to recall Parliament to pass new anti-terror laws
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Sinn Fein comments; INCORPORATES London-dated
Britain-Northern Ireland; Blair expected in Northern Ireland around
1300 GMT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Sinn Fein, the IRA's political
ally, said Tuesday that plans by British Prime Minister Tony Blair
to recall Parliament to pass tough new anti-terrorist laws were a
``massive overreaction'' that could jeopardize the peace process.
	   Blair was expected to announce during a visit Tuesday that he
will summon legislators back to London from their summer break
following Northern Ireland's deadliest attack in three decades _ a
bombing in Omagh Aug. 15 by a dissident group that killed 28
people.
	   ``The great danger in introducing these measures is that we
could have a situation developing which could have great and
serious implications for the peace agreement and Sinn Fein's role
within it,'' Martin McGuinness, Sinn Fein spokesman, said in a
British Broadcasting Corp. television interview.
	   Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern also has pledged new
anti-terrorist laws, and the Irish Parliament is expected to meet
in emergency session in Dublin starting Sept. 2.
	   The new measures would make it easier to secure convictions
against members of terrorist groups.
	   The legislation is aimed at dissident groups who failed to
endorse the Northern Ireland peace agreement accepted by the Irish
Republican Army and Sinn Fein. Those groups include the Real IRA,
which admitted it planted the Omagh bomb.
	   Under new laws, suspected bombers and gunmen could be jailed for
belonging to an illegal organization based on the testimony of a
police officer.
	   Until now, convicting people of membership of outlawed groups
has been extremely difficult. The groups keep no written records of
membership, senior members do not involve themselves directly in
perpetrating attacks, and potential civilian witnesses risk being
killed as informers.
	   McGuinness called Northern Ireland's predominantly Protestant
Royal Ulster Constabulary the most discredited police force in
Western Europe and said innocent people therefore could be jailed.
	   The new measures are expected to have been passed north and
south of the Irish border by the time U.S. President Bill Clinton
arrives in Belfast next Thursday, The Times of London said Tuesday.

Fisherman drowns trying to pull out giant fish
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LJUBLJANA, Slovenia (AP) _ A passionate angler caught a fish so
big in a lake in eastern Slovenia that he drowned trying to reel it
in, the state-run news agency STA reported Tuesday.
	   Quoting a friend of Franc Filipic, STA said the 47-year-old
fisherman was so determined to land the sheatfish, a kind of
catfish, after hooking it last weekend that he walked into the lake
and refused to let go when it pulled him under.
	   The friend, who was not identified, said Filipic's last words
before he drowned were: ``Now I've got him!''
	   Police and divers found his body only after a two-day search.
The fish was not found.
	   How big was it? This may sound fishy, but the friend swore it
must have weighed 50 kilograms (over 20 pounds) and was about two
meters (over six feet) long.

Israeli helicopter strike kills guerrilla in south Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli helicopter gunships rocketed a car
near this southern port city on Tuesday, killing a military
official of the Shiite Muslim guerrilla group Amal, security
officials said.
	   Wissam al-Amin, 31, was killed when a single rocket hit his
vehicle at 12:30 p.m. (0930 GMT) on the coastal road about 12
kilometers (7.5 miles) south of Tyre, said the Lebanese officials,
speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Two helicopter gunships flew in from the sea and attacked the
car, a blue BMW sedan, as it drove in the area, about 15 kilometers
(10 miles) north of the Israeli border and only 1.2 kilometers (.7
miles) from a checkpoint of U.N. peacekeepers deployed in the
region.
	   The dead man was identified as an Amal military official in the
south. The pro-Syrian Amal, one of several guerrilla groups
fighting Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon, is led by Lebanese
Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri.
	   Amal activists collected the body from the smoldering car less
than an hour after the attack.
	   Israel has in the past used helicopter gunships to hunt down
commanders of Shiite guerrillas who are fighting to dislodge
Israel's occupation army from a border zone in southern Lebanon.
	   In February 1992, Israeli helicopters destroyed a guerrilla
motorcade, killing Sheik Abbas Musawi, the secretary general of
Hezbollah, the Shiite movement leading the guerrilla war in the
south.
	   Last week, three Israeli soldiers were killed in two separate
attacks by guerrillas in the south.

Philippine health department raises alert against HIV-infected
</HEADLINE>
blood &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) - The Philippine health department
issued an alert Tuesday on HIV-tainted blood after an infected,
26-year-old man confessed to selling his blood to commercial blood
banks at least five times in the last few months.
	   A statement from the department advised all commercial blood
banks to strictly screen donors after discovering that an apparent
lapse in screening allowed the man to sell his blood repeatedly.
	   Dr. Eric Tayag said the man may have used different names when
he sold his blood.
	   The health department is now tracing the recipients of his blood
so that ``appropriate measures'' can be carried out.
	   The health department said the donor has been admitted to the
San Lazaro Hospital, where AIDS patients are treated. The man is
also undergoing ``detoxification, debriefing and counseling for
substance abuse,'' the health department said.
	   The Philippine government has no volunteer blood donor program.
Most of the blood used in transfusion is supplied by the country's
29 commercial blood banks.
	   A health department study showed that sellers, who are mostly
poor, were more likely to have contagious diseases such as malaria,
syphilis, hepatitis and HIV than those who donate blood
voluntarily.
	   The 1994 study said blood from commercial banks infected at
least 11 people with HIV. It also said that of 426 donors, 13 were
infected with hepatitis-B and two others were HIV-positive.
	   A law ordered the closure of commercial blood banks in May but
the Supreme Court has suspended its implementation. Blood bank
operators claimed the law violated private enterprise and would
create an ``unparalleled medical disaster'' by reducing the amount
of blood available. The case has not yet been resolved.
	   Nationwide since 1984, 1,099 people have tested positive for the
HIV virus, including 343 who are known to have full-blown AIDS.
	   The health department estimates that about 33,000 people in the
country are afflicted with the disease without knowing it.

Germany seeks solution for Nazi slave labor claims
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ German industry could compensate people
forced to work as slave laborers under the Nazis by contributing to
funds for Holocaust victims living in eastern Europe, the
government said Tuesday.
	   German companies are seeking ways to pre-empt lawsuits on behalf
of former slave workers and want the government to launch a new
compensation fund they could pay into as well. But Chancellor
Helmut Kohl rejected the idea last week, saying the government had
given enough compensation.
	   Instead, industry could channel money into funds for Holocaust
victims in eastern Europe that the German government set up after
the fall of communism, Kohl's spokesman Otto Hauser said Tuesday.
	   Through the funds, Germany gave 1.5 billion marks (dlrs 840
million) in one-time payments to people in the region who suffered
under the Nazis, he said.
	   The government would sound out industry on its proposal once
German courts have issued final verdicts on pending World War II
slave labor cases, Hauser said on Deutschlandfunk radio.
	   Germany has paid tens of billions of marks (dollars) to
compensate victims of the Nazi regime. But the government has
refused to pay back wages to former slave laborers, arguing they
were used by private companies.
	   Most German firms maintain, though, that the workers were forced
on them by the Nazis.
	   Daimler, Germany's biggest industrial group, said last week it
would consider paying into a government fund for former slave
laborers.
	   Volkswagen, Europe's biggest automaker, made a surprise
announcement last month that it would pay its World War II slave
laborers on its own.

Myanmar domestic airliner believed to have crashed in Laos
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ A Myanmar Airways domestic flight missing
with 39 people aboard is believed to have crashed in a rice field
in Laos, a government official said Tuesday.
	   No other details were immediately available.
	   The Fokker Friendship aircraft was on a flight Monday from
Yangon to the northern city of Tachilek when the crew contacted the
Tachilek control tower and complained of poor weather.
	   Shortly afterward, contact was lost and Myanmar authorities
mounted a search and rescue operation. There were no foreigners on
board. Two of the passengers were infants.
	   Tachilek, 560 kilometers (350 miles) north of Yangon, straddles
the border with Thailand in the remote, opium-rich Golden Triangle,
where the borders of Myanmar, Thailand and Laos converge.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ A panel of scientific experts from the
15 EU nations has recommended approval of the sale of the impotence
drug Viagra across the European Union, officials said Tuesday.
	   The full 20-member European Commission, the EU executive panel,
is expected to rule the issue on Sept. 15.
	   In a statement, it said a majority of member states'
representatives on the scientific panel had recommended that
Viagra, which is made by the pharmaceutical company Pfizer, be
approved for sale.
	   At the request of some governments, the Commission said if
Viagra gets the green light it will be on condition that its label
specify the possibility of ``undesirable effects.''

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ President Laurent Kabila returned to
Congo's capital Tuesday for the first time in more than a week
after his government and allied African forces began preparing a
new wave of offensives in Congo's east.
	   Kabila's motorcade _ a caravan of black limousines flanked by
pickup trucks filled with commandos _ zipped through Kinshasa's
rutted streets early Tuesday morning.
	   Information Minister Didier Mumengi confirmed Kabila's return.
	   The president had been holed up in the southern city of
Lubumbashi for more than a week while his capital seemed in peril
from an advancing rebel army.
	   But a string of victories by Congolese soldiers and their
Angolan allies in a western corridor that stretches from the
capital, Kinshasa, to the Atlantic Ocean, have put the rebels on
the defensive.
	   ``The Congolese army and our allies are looking for the same
victories in the east,'' Voice of the People radio reported.
	   In eastern Congo, rebel officials said Angolan and Zimbabwean
aircraft had bombed the rebel-held city of Kisangani and the town
of Kasangulu, 30 kilometers (15 miles) south of Kinshasa.
	   Bizima Karaha, speaking in eastern town of Goma, said the planes
had bombed civilian targets in Kisangani, Congo's third-largest
city. The city was captured by rebels in recent days.
	   ``They cannot recapture Kisangani, only bomb it from the air,''
he said. ``This is terrorism.''
	   The bombing report, however, could not be independently
confirmed.

Israeli helicopter strike kills guerrilla in south Lebanon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS first name of slain guerrilla, UPDATES with one SLA
militiaman killed

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli helicopter gunships rocketed a
vehicle near this southern port city on Tuesday, killing a military
official of the Shiite Muslim guerrilla group Amal, security
officials said.
	   Hossam al-Amin, 31, was killed and his vehicle gutted when a
single rocket hit at 12:30 p.m. (0930GMT) on the coastal road about
12 kilometers (7.5 miles) south of Tyre, said the Lebanese
officials, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Elsewhere on the front line in the south, an Israeli-backed
militiaman was killed in a guerrilla attack earlier in the day, the
security officials said.
	   The militiaman of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia
was killed in a roadside bomb near Jezzine. Rocket and artillery
exchanges ensued between the raiding guerrillas of the Shiite
Hezbollah and the SLA garrison, said the officials.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the
attack on a mountain outpost outside Jezzine on the northern edge
of the Israeli-occupied zone in the south and some 30 kilometers
(19 miles) from the Israeli border.
	   In the raid that killed the Amal guerrilla, two helicopter
gunships flew in from the sea and attacked the vehicle, a blue BMW
sedan, as it drove in the area, about 15 kilometers (10 miles)
north of the Israeli border and only 1.2 kilometers (.7 miles) from
a checkpoint of U.N. peacekeepers deployed in the region.
	   The dead man was identified as an Amal military official in the
south. The pro-Syrian Amal, one of several guerrilla groups
fighting Israeli occupation of the south, is led by Lebanese
Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri.
	   Less than an hour after the attack, Amal activists collected the
body and pieces of flesh from the smoldering car. The vehicle's
twisted hulk was tossed about 10 meters (yards) into the bush on
the side of the road from the impact.
	   Israel has in the past used helicopter gunships to hunt down
commanders of Shiite guerrillas who are waging a war to dislodge
Israel's occupation army ad allied SLA militiamen from a border
zone in southern Lebanon.
	   In February 1992, Israeli helicopters destroyed a guerrilla
motorcade, killing Sheik Abbas Musawi, the secretary general of
Hezbollah, the Shiite movement leading the guerrilla war in the
south.
	   Last week, three Israeli soldiers were killed in two separate
attacks by guerrillas in the south.

Press at 1100 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed mixed Tuesday, with
share prices rebounding in Tokyo on the back of overnight gains on
Wall Street. Tokyo's 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 84.57
points, or 0.56 percent, to close above the psychologically
important 15,000-point level at 15,072.93. In currency trading, the
U.S. dollar was quoted at 144.76 yen in late afternoon trading, up
0.36 yen from late Monday in Tokyo and above its late New York rate
of 143.95 yen overnight. Malaysian shares also closed higher,
helped by increasing stability of Asian currencies and overnight
gains on Wall Street. The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's Composite
Index rose 6.97 points, or 2.1 percent, to 324.17. Hong Kong shares
closed generally higher, with the government showing no indication
that it would give up its intervention in the market. The Hang Seng
Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of blue chips, rose
44.61 points, or 0.6 percent, to close at 7,890.09. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin has
approved a plan to restructure dlrs 40 billion in short-term debt,
including more than dlrs 11 billion in bonds held by foreign
investors, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported Tuesday. The terms
were to be announced later Tuesday, more than a week after the
government announced that the country's severe economic crisis
would force a debt restructuring. The announcement has already been
postponed twice, after foreign investors protested that the
restructuring would favor Russian commercial banks. The delay
reflected Russia's political limbo following President Boris
Yeltsin's dismissal Sunday of Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko. On
his first day in office, Chernomyrdin on Monday asked the State
Duma, the lower house of parliament, to set aside ``for the time
being'' a set of economic austerity measures that had been demanded
by international lenders and formulated by Kiriyenko's team. The
ruble was falling fast Tuesday, despite heavy intervention by the
Russian Central Bank. Shortly after the start of trading, the ruble
had already fallen 9.9 percent, and was trading at 7.8500 to the
dollar, compared to 7.1400 to the dollar Monday. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ In a move certain to rattle the Boeing
Co., British Airways said Tuesday it will order its first batch of
jets from Europe's Airbus Industrie. Airbus called a news
conference with British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Airbus
President Noel Forgeard later Tuesday at its headquarters in
Toulouse, France, to unveil details of the plan. British Airways,
in a statement Tuesday morning, said it will buy 59 short-haul jets
in the A320 family, with options to buy another 129, the airline
said in a statement released Tuesday morning. BA chief executive
Bob Ayling acknowledged the deal would disappoint Boeing. Asked if
he thought choosing a European supplier would help BA get European
Union approval for its controversial alliance with American
Airlines, Ayling indicated the decision was purely commercial. ``I
don't think it will make any difference,'' said Ayling. ``British
Airways bought these aircraft because they offered us the best
value.'' (BRITISH AIRWAYS-JETS)
	   DELRAY BEACH, Florida (AP) _ Sunbeam Corp.'s new management
reversed decisions made by ruthless former chairman ``Chain Saw''
Al Dunlap, sparing U.S. and Mexican factories and planning to keep
businesses previously intended for sale. Jerry Levin replaced
Dunlap, who was ousted in June after failing to boost Sunbeam's
flagging shares even after big job cuts. During a conference call
with analysts and shareholders Monday, Levin announced plans to
keep the Sunbeam plants open. ``Although we still have much to do
in the short term to stabilize Sunbeam's businesses, our strategic
focus is on growth,'' Levin said during the conference call. The
Delray Beach-based company has seen its stock plummet in the past
year _ going from a high of dlrs 53 to as low as dlrs 5.12 _ after
acquiring the Mr. Coffee, First Alert and Coleman brands in May. It
closed up 25 cents Monday at dlrs 8.81 1/4 on the New York Stock
Exchange. The decision by Sunbeam's board to fire Dunlap set off a
wave of financial scrutiny of the consumer-products giant.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ China is still aiming for an 8 percent gross
domestic product growth this year, but President Jiang Zemin warned
on Tuesday that it could fall short of the goal. ``If it is
somewhat lower, I don't think people should be worried,'' Jiang
told The Associated Press. ``The highest growth rate is not
necessarily the best.'' Jiang added that this year's natural
disasters and floods will have ``no serious impact'' on China's
economic growth. In fact, he saw a kind of silver lining in the
floods. ``This is an example of how a serious disaster can turn
into a kind of good,'' he said, pointing out that reconstruction
would require ``considerable capital investment'' on major
projects, which would in turn help stimulate the economy. Jiang
spoke in a wide-ranging, two-hour meeting with members of the AP
Board of Directors and senior AP news executives. He said he was
confident in the basic strength of China's economy because of its
huge domestic market, an expected ``bumper harvest,'' large grain
reserves, and dlrs 140 billion in foreign exchange reserves.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   WASHINGTON _ Traces of a manmade chemical found in a sample of
Sudanese soil formed the basis of the U.S. decision to launch
cruise missiles at a purported pharmaceuticals plant in Khartoum.
Under pressure to back up the U.S. claim, the government let the
U.S. intelligence official speak Monday on condition of anonymity.
The agent said the soil sample obtained clandestinely showed traces
of a substance called EMPTA, or O-ethylmethylphosphonothioic acid _
a material with no commercial uses that is a key ingredient of the
deadly VX nerve gas. The administration also conceded for the first
time, after eyewitness accounts from the smoldering ruins of the
Shifa plant, that the facility probably also manufactured
medicines. Among other things, the plant had been approved to
produce medicine for shipment to Iraq under the humanitarian
exception to U.N.-imposed trade sanctions. The Shifa
Pharmaceuticals plant in Khartoum, Sudan, was destroyed last
Thursday in a U.S. cruise missile attack at the same time that
Navy-launched missiles struck at a suspected terrorist base in
eastern Afghanistan. (US-BOMBINGS)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Osama bin Laden, the Saudi millionaire believed
responsible for the deadly U.S. embassy bombings in Africa, has
been charged with soliciting murder in the United States, a source
said Monday. The indictment came weeks ago _ well before the Aug. 7
twin bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, said the
source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. It was not clear
exactly which incident led to the indictment. The New York grand
jury that indicted him was convened more than a year ago to examine
terrorist activities with a focus on bin Laden, said the source,
who is familiar with the investigation. The indictment came after
evidence was presented that bin Laden had called publicly for
violence against and killing of U.S. citizens, the source said. The
grand jury was convened after 19 U.S. service personnel were killed
when a bomb went off in June 1996 at a U.S. military apartment
complex in Saudi Arabia. A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney, said he
could not comment on reports that bin Laden had been indicted. (BIN
LADEN INDICTMENT)
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Saying it had captured several key
western towns, including the only port on the Congo River, Congo's
government has rejected a cease-fire proposal. Information Minister
Didier Mumengi on Monday said Congolese and Angolan allied forces
had retaken the port of Matadi. What began three weeks ago as an
armed rebellion against Kabila has now drawn three of Congo's
neighboring countries _ Angola and Zimbabwe for the government and
Rwanda and Uganda on the rebel side _ into the conflict. The string
of government victories came as Ugandan troops were seen deploying
in the northwest in support of a rebel army seeking to topple
President Laurent Kabila. The rebels now appear to be trapped
between the government's coalition of defense forces positioned at
either end of a corridor of land stretching about 400 kilometers
(250 miles) from the Atlantic coast to the capital, Kinshasa. In
the east, however, the rebels were still firming in control of
their positions, including the newly captured city of Kisangani.
(CONGO)
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ Sinn Fein on Tuesday denounced as a
``massive overreaction'' plans by British Prime Minister Tony Blair
to recall Parliament to pass new anti-terrorist laws after a
bombing that killed 28 people. Blair was expected to announce the
emergency recall later Tuesday, while visiting Omagh for the first
time since the Aug. 15 car bomb exploded in the worst terrorist
attack in Northern Ireland's history. Press reports said the House
of Commons and House of Lords would be recalled next week to enact
laws designed to ease convictions of members of terrorist groups
who did not endorse the peace agreement for Northern Ireland. One
of those groups, Irish Republican Army dissidents known as the Real
IRA, has admitted to carrying out the bombing in Omagh. The Irish
parliament is also expected to be recalled to pass the measures,
which let the testimony of police officers count as evidence of
membership of an illegal terrorist organization. Civilian witnesses
ran the risk of retribution. (NORTHERN IRELAND)
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Even as a peace deal with the
Palestinians appeared closer at hand, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu Tuesday paid a surprise visit to Jewish settlers in
Hebron and promised to expand their community in this tense
Palestinian town. In an unannounced condolence visit Tuesday,
Netanyahu said he would build new homes for the 450 Jews living in
the divided city of 130,000 Palestinians. Netanyahu's gesture was
aimed at his hard-line critics, including many settler leaders, who
have demanded that Israel break off negotiations with the
Palestinians following the killing of a well-known Hebron rabbi,
apparently by a Palestinian, last week. Netanyahu and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat reportedly have softened their positions on an
Israeli troop withdrawal in the West Bank after a 17-month
stalemate, though both sides said Tuesday that several issues
remained unresolved. The progress made in recent days apparently
was not sufficient to persuade U.S. Mideast peace envoy Dennis Ross
to return to the region. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)

EU Clears Volkswagen's purchase of Rolls Royce
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission on Tuesday
cleared Volkswagen AG's acquisition of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Ltd.
saying it posed no anti-trust problems anywhere in the 15-nation
European Union.
	   It said Volkswagen's increased luxury car market share after the
purchase of Rolls Royce, ``does not exceed 5 percent in any of the
15 EU member states.''
	   The German automaker will gain the right to make Bentley and
Cosworth luxury brand cars.
	   But the purchase from Britain's defense and propulsion company
Vickers Plc doesn't include rights to the Rolls-Royce brand name
and logo. These are held by the British jet engine maker
Rolls-Royce Plc (U.RR).
	   Under a deal with VW, German car maker Bayerische Motoren Werke
AG bought the Rolls Royce name for dlrs 66 million in August from
Rolls-Royce Plc, its partner in an aerospace venture.
	   It will let VW use it for free until Dec. 31, 2002. Thereafter,
VW will market its luxury car under the Bentley brand, whereas BMW
will produce and sell the Rolls-Royce marque.
	   However Rolls-Royce Motors does own the rights to the imposing
radiator grille and elegant ``flying lady'' radiator ornament that
are considered key to the Rolls brand identity.
	   Volkswagen's purchase of Rolls-Royce Motors marks yet another
acquisition in a fast-consolidating industry. Other recent moves
include another purchase by Volkswagen - of Lamborghini - and
Germany's Daimler-Benz AG agreement to purchase Chrysler Corp. of
the United States.

China braces for renewed flooding on Yangtze River
</HEADLINE>

account of deaths; ADDS photo number, byline

 &UR; By JOHN LEICESTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's exhausted flood fighters were ordered to
remain on guard as a new surge of high water barreled down the
Yangtze River on Tuesday, threatening to overwhelm dikes weakened
by a summer of devastating floods.
	   China's flood control headquarters described the situation as
``extremely serious.'' It warned that along a 300-kilometer
(180-mile) stretch of the river, water levels stood at historic
highs and some places have been inundated for 60 days or more.
	   The new Yangtze flood crest _ the seventh so far in a summer of
flooding that has seen thousands killed and millions made homeless
_ was expected to reach the city of Shashi in the Yangtze's middle
reaches by Tuesday evening, said Zhou Wenzhi, vice minister of
water resources.
	   But water levels on the river at Shashi were expected to remain
below 45 meters (148.5 feet) _ the level at which officials have
said they might dynamite dikes to deliberately flood an area where
half a million people live to save cities downstream.
	   He predicted that high flood levels on the middle and lower
reaches of the river would persist for another 20 days _ as long as
no more heavy rains fall.
	   With good weather, China's flood season should be over by
October, Zhou said.
	   President Jiang Zemin noted the heroic efforts of millions of
civilians and soldiers manning dikes on the Yangtze. But he
predicted that the devastation will not significantly impact
China's economy.
	   In an interview with current and former members of the Board of
Directors of The Associated Press, Jiang also lamented nature's
ability to overwhelm modern technology.
	   ``We can predict the rainfall, but can't stop it from falling
from the skies,'' Jiang said.
	   Flooding is at its worst in 44 years along the Yangtze and in
decades in the northeast. Government spokesman Zhao Qizheng said
Tuesday that deaths have increased but are not expected to surpass
4,000 _ less than double the nearly three-week-old official tally
of more than 2,000.
	   Given China's population of 1.2 billion and the sheer scale of
the flooding, ``the figure of casualties was very, very small,''
Zhou said.
	   He discounted reports that thousands of people had been killed
in flooding in Jiayu county in hard-hit Hubei province, saying
instead that 44 people were killed.
	   Vital dikes that protect major industrial centers and rich
farmland are ``once again facing a serious test,'' the flood
control headquarters said.
	   While the flood crest was not expected to reach the highs of
those that preceded it, flood fighters were told to prepare.
	   ``Persevere and persevere again to win the climatic battle in
the fight against floods,'' the Communist Party newspaper People's
Daily exhorted.
	   Hubei was concentrating troops along dikes that threatened to
give way, the People's Daily said.
	   Officials ordered that lighting and telephones be set up along
endangered dikes and stocks of sand, stone and sacks for sandbags
be prepared, the newspaper reported.
	   Manufacturers of life jackets, bottled drinking water, medicines
and fast food were asked to work overtime to provide supplies for
flood victims, the official Xinhua News Agency said.
	   Meanwhile, the government worked to prevent the misuse or theft
of relief funds and donations. Hubei's government fired officials
who embezzled 2,000 yuan (dlrs 240) or more in relief money, Xinhua
said.

Bahraini business tycoon, Abdulrahman Almoayyed, dead at 84
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ Abdulrahman Khalil Almoayyed, a Bahraini
businessman who expanded his father's pearl business into a
multinational empire with stakes in shipping, steel, oil and
construction, has died, his family said Tuesday.
	   Almoayyed died Monday of a heart attack. He was 84.
	   Almoayyed, who was born in Manama, Bahrain's capital, joined his
family's pearl business in 1920s and later in the 1930's oil
discovery on the island expanded it into a regional empire with
interests throughout the Gulf.
	   A strong believer in linking with multinational companies,
Almoayyed set up many joint-ventures, including Almoayyed Barwil
shipping company in association with the top Norwegian shipping
family, Wilhemson.
	   Aside from the family business, Almoayyed served as a member of
the board of the island's central bank, the Bahrain Monetary
Agency.
	   In 1964 he built Bahrain's first high-rise building with an
elevator, building on land reclaimed from the sea, which sparked a
swift development process on the island.
	   His family declined to discuss Almoayyed's holdings, but they
are believed to run into the millions of dollars. A son, Tawfiq,
described Almoayyed as ``a very hard working man who kept a low
profile and avoided publicity.''
	   Almoayyed is survived by his wife, Amina, and four sons,
including the former Information Minister Tariq Almoayyed, and two
daughters.

Ritz Hotel director meets Diana judge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The head of the Ritz Hotel was questioned by a
French judge Tuesday about the night that Princess Diana was
killed.
	   It was the first time Judge Herve Stephan had questioned Frank
Klein, whose testimony had been widely anticipated.
	   Klein met with Stephan for two hours behind closed doors at the
Palais de Justice in central Paris, then left without any comment
to reporters.
	   Another Ritz official, Claude Roulet, was to be questioned later
in the day.
	   The Ritz is owned by Mohamed Al Fayed, father of Diana's
boyfriend Dodi Fayed.
	   Diana, Dodi Fayed and their driver, Henri Paul, were killed in a
car crash last Aug. 31 in the Pont de l'Alma traffic tunnel. They
had left the Ritz in their Mercedes, which the Ritz had rented from
the Etoile Limousine Co.
	   Driver Paul was drunk at the time of the crash, and believed to
be driving at a very high speed.
	   The only survivor was bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones, who worked
for Al Fayed at the time but has since resigned. Rees-Jones'
lawyer, Christian Curtil, recently asked Stephan to question Klein
about possible security lapses at the Ritz that night.
	   There also have been questions raised about whether the Mercedes
was faulty. The judge has heard testimony that the car was
precarious if the brakes were slammed on suddenly.

Empty homes in Jewish settlements in West Bank, Gaza Strip
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A quarter of the homes built by the Israeli
government in Jewish settlements in the West Bank and the Gaza
Strip between 1989 and 1992 still stand empty, according to a
Housing Ministry document obtained Tuesday.
	   The figures appear to undermine claims by Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu that more construction in Jewish settlements is
necessary to accommodate population growth.
	   The Palestinians, who want to establish a state in the West Bank
and Gaza, say settlement construction is part of a land grab. The
United States has long demanded that Israel freeze settlement
expansion to improve the negotiating climate with the Palestinians.
	   According to a Housing Ministry survey obtained Tuesday by The
Associated Press, the hardline Likud government of then-Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir built 3,905 homes in the West Bank and Gaza
with public funds between 1989-1992.
	   Fifty-five percent, or 2,126, were never sold. Of those still on
the market, 519 have been rented and 613 have been occupied by
squatters or are being used by settlements as offices.
	   Another 994 homes, or 25.5 percent, remain empty.
	   The Housing Ministry recommends a more aggressive marketing
campaign to sell the homes. The ministry is also considering ways
to legalize the illegal seizures, the Maariv newspaper said.
	   Netanyahu's senior aide, David Bar-Illan, said that while in
outlying settlements some homes are empty, in many other
communities there was a waiting list for people trying to move in.
	   Earlier this week, the government allocated another dlrs 24.2
million for settlement construction.
	   In addition, dlrs 2.7 million were set aside for building
permanent homes in Tel Romeida, a trailer park in one of the Jewish
enclaves of the Palestinian town of Hebron. The money was allotted
after a prominent rabbi was stabbed to death in Tel Romeida last
week, allegedly by a Palestinian.

Radio: Bomb on Kigali-bound bus kills 30
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ A bomb exploded on a bus bound for
Kigali, Rwanda, killing at least 30 passengers, a private radio
station said Tuesday.
	   The police had no immediate comment on the report.
	   Capital FM said the explosion occurred after the bus had left
Kampala and was on the main highway between Masaka and Mbarara on
the way to the Rwandan capital.
	   The radio did not say when the explosion occurred, but it did
say the injured had been taken to hospital in Mbarara, 282
kilometers (175 miles) southwest of Kampala.

Paul Gascoigne's story marriage ends in divorce
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Soccer star Paul Gascoigne's stormy two-year
marriage ended Tuesday when his wife Sheryl was granted a
``quickie'' divorce on grounds of what was described as his
unreasonable behavior.
	   Sheryl, who was beaten up by a drunken Gascoigne in a
highly-publicized incident four months after they married in June
1996, said in her divorce petition that the player's behavior ``had
affected my health.''
	   The midfielder was training Tuesday with his club Middlesbrough
aned was not present for the brief procedure. Sheryl was not
present either.
	   The divorce decree was granted in two minutes by Senior District
Judge Gerald Angel at the Principal Registry of the Family Division
in central London, ending the marriage after 785 days.
	   The only people present in the court room were the judge, his
clerk and about a dozen journalists.
	   The couple must wait six weeks for the divorce decree to become
final.
	   The decree stated that the marriage had ``broken down
irretrievably'' and that Gascoigne ``had behaved in such a way that
(his wife) cannot reasonably be expected to live with'' him.
	   There are likely to be continuing legal battles over the size of
the financial settlement. Gascoigne is reported to be worth 5
million pounds (dlrs 8 million).
	   Sheryl is expected to be granted custody of the couple's
two-year-old son, Regan.
	   She has two other children, Mason, eight, and Bianca Jade, 11,
by a first marriage.
	   Before the marriage, Gascoigne said Sheryl had transformed him
from childish thug to responsible father.
	   But soon after the ceremony he returned to his old drinking
mates, including Jimmy ``Five Bellies'' Gardner.
	   Gascoigne left his wife with a black eye and badly bruised face
and arm after he attacked her in a drunken rage in Gleneagles,
Scotland in 1996. The couple later separated.
	   Gascoigne, 31, turned to 33-year-old Sheryl for support after he
was dropped from the England national team by coach Glenn Hoddle on
the eve of this summer's World Cup in France.
	   Gazza regularly visited her home and the couple went on a
Florida vacation together. But despite the player's hopes of a
reconciliation, Sheryl decided to go ahead with the divorce.
	   Gascoigne joined Middlesbrough late last season from Glasgow
Rangers. He previously played for Tottenham and Italian club Lazio.

Investors await government decision on debt restructuring
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with ruble closing down 10 percent, stocks up in thin
trade. &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Russia-Politics &QL; 
 &UR; By JUDITH INGRAM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin has
approved a plan to restructure dlrs 40 billion in short-term debt,
including more than dlrs 11 billion in bonds held by foreign
investors, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported Tuesday.
	   The terms were to be announced later in the day, more than a
week after the government announced that the country's severe
economic crisis would force a debt restructuring. The announcement
has already been postponed twice, after foreign investors protested
that the restructuring would favor Russian commercial banks.
	   The delay reflected Russia's political limbo following President
Boris Yeltsin's dismissal of Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko on
Sunday. On his first day in office, Chernomyrdin on Monday asked
the State Duma, the lower house of parliament, to set aside ``for
the time being'' a set of economic austerity measures that had been
demanded by international lenders and formulated by Kiriyenko's
team.
	   The ruble fell 10 percent in trading Tuesday, closing at 7.86 to
the dollar, down from 7.14 on Monday. Trading volume amounted to
dlrs 430 million.
	   The Central Bank has been selling dollars steadily in recent
sessions in an effort to slow the fall of the Russian currency. By
midday on Tuesday alone, it had already spent about dlrs 340
million to defend the ruble, traders said. Trading was suspended
twice on the interbank currency exchange when the bank was
overwhelmed by demand for dollars.
	   Stocks rose in thin trading, despite a steady absence of foreign
investors who were worried over the state debt restructuring plan.
	   The market activity was driven mostly by local investors,
speculating on quick moves in the stock prices after most Russian
blue chips plummeted amid recent financial turmoil.
	   At 2 p.m. (1000 GMT), the Russian Trading System index climbed
to 88.42 points, up 2.3 percent from Monday's close at 86.40
points.

Angolans, Zimbabweans bomb Kisangani, Kasangulu, rebels say
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in 5th graf with senior Zimbabwe government officials
confirming Air Force Commander in Congo and has assumed command of
allied forces &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Angolan and Zimbabwean jet fighters
supporting the government of President Laurent Kabila have bombed
rebel-held Kisangani and continue to attack rebels forces southwest
of the capital, Kinshasa, rebels said Tuesday.
	   Bizima Karaha, Kabila's former foreign minister, said Kisangani,
Congo's third largest city which fell to the rebels Sunday, was
attacked early Tuesday.#
	   ``No military objectives were hit, only civilian targets,''
Karaha said. ``They cannot recapture Kisangani, only bomb it from
the air. This is terrorism.''
	   Karaha said the commander of the Zimbabwean Air Force was in
Kinshasa personally issuing orders to Angolan and Zimbabwean
pilots.
	   In Harare, senior Zimbabwe government officials confirmed that
Air Force Commander Air Marshal Perence Shiri is in Congo and has
assumed command of the allied forces.
	   Karaha said on Monday the aircraft bombed rebel frontline
positions for an hour at Kasangulu, 30 kilometers (15 miles)
southwest of Kinshasa, before the rebels repelled ground attack
from an Angolan unit.
	   ``All they are doing is sending planes to bomb innocent
civilians. We hold Zimbabwe and Angola responsible,'' he said.
	   ``We are calling upon the international community to stop the
killing,'' he said.
	   Karaha said the air base at Matadi, about 150 kilometers (90
miles) southwest of Kinshasa, was in rebel hands despite government
reports that it had been recaptured.

Reports: Edmundo set to return to Fiorentina this week
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FLORENCE, Italy (AP) _ Fiery Brazilian striker Edmundo has
settled his differences with Fiorentina and will join the Serie A
club this week, Italian newspapers reported Tuesday.
	   The 27-year-old reportedly faxed a letter to club headquarters
saying he would honor a slightly redrawn contract _ though one
without a requested pay hike.
	   Edmundo scored four goals in nine games for Fiorentina last
season. But he argued openly with the team over playing time, and
at one point returned to Brazil before being coaxed back.
	   Gazzetta dello Sport and Corriere dello Sport both reported that
Edmundo's new deal stipulates that he can be traded after this
season for a transfer fee of dlrs 13 million, but only to a
Brazilian club. According to the newspapers, the letter also calls
for the player to receive a car, six airline tickets between Rome
and Rio de Janeiro, and the refurbishing of his villa.

Iraq's Foreign Minister leaves for South Africa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) - Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed
al-Sahhaf left Tuesday on his way to South Africa to attend
preparations for a Non-Aligned Movement summit meeting, the Iraqi
news agency said.
	   Al-Sahhaf will also meet with his counterparts to discuss the
summit's agenda and ``strengthen bilateral relations with their
countries,'' INA said.
	   Al-Sahhaf left by road for neighboring Jordan because of the
U.N. ban on air travel in and out of Iraq. He will fly from the
Jordanian capital Amman to Cairo, where he is expected to meet
Wednesday with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa.
	   It is unclear how long al-Sahhaf will remain in South Africa.
Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan is expected to attend the
summit scheduled Aug. 29-Sept.3 in the coastal city of Durban.
	   The United Nations imposed sweeping air, arms and trade
sanctions against Iraq after Baghdad's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The
sanctions will only be lifted after U.N. arms inspectors certify
that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction.
	   Earlier this month, South Africa said it would establish
diplomatic relations within weeks because it wants the Gulf country
to attend the NAM summit.
	   Reports in South Africa suggested restoring relations would help
clear up a nearly dlrs 164 million debt that Iraq owes for weapons
it bought from South Africa's arms industry during apartheid rule.

Torrential rains take heavy toll of lives in North Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ North Korea, its chronic food shortage
aggravated by years of bad weather, said Tuesday that continuing
heavy rains and strong wind have taken a ``heavy toll of lives.''
	   Heavy rains and strong wind have submerged thousands of hectares
of arable land, submerged 1,500 houses and public buildings,
destroyed 50 roads, 90 bridges and several railways Sunday and
Monday the North's official Korean Central News Agency said.
	   ``The rain took a heavy toll of lives. The dead, the wounded and
the missing are counted,'' the agency said without giving any
figures.
	   ``Emergency relief steps have been taken in the afflicted
areas,'' it said.
	   The agency began reporting on the rains Saturday, saying the
natural disaster has damaged crops in North Korea, which already is
suffering through a famine after three years of floods and drought.
	   The agency has said downpours inundated more than 180,000 acres
of arable land, destroyed or submerged 42,500 homes in July and
August, and may decrease the rice harvest by 60 percent in a major
farming area.
	   U.N. agencies have asked for 650,000 tons of emergency food
assistance before the October harvest. Of the committed food, about
330,000 tons have been provided.
	   The North's continuing reports on flood damage are unusual.
South Korean officials said the reports may be part of Pyongyang's
effort to stress the need for an early shipment of the remaining
portion of the promised food.

Officials: 90 percent of Singapore financial bodies ready for 2000
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The Monetary Authority of Singapore, the
country's de facto central bank, expects 90 percent of the
country's financial institutions to be able to deal with the
millennium bug, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   The bank also said it will impose restrictions on those
companies that cannot cope with the problem, in which computer
systems using a two-digit format to mark years can be disrupted
when the year 2000 arrives, The Business Times said.
	   A worst-case scenario might involve entire computer systems
crashing and billions of dollars in overseas transactions becoming
lost, the paper said.
	   Singapore's entire financial sector will undergo a year 2000
readiness test in the first quarter of next year.
	   ``This landmark test will help MAS identify weaknesses in the
system as well as the financial institutions that require extra
assistance and supervision,'' MAS managing director Koh Yong Guan
was quoted as saying.
	   ``The institutions that are eventually unable to prove their
year 2000 readiness in time will have restrictions placed on them
so as to insulate the rest of the system,'' Koh said.
	   Some experts in Singapore have said that many businesses,
including banks, are not adequately prepared for the calendar
change, although the government has said that most large
institutions are ready.
	   Because of their location closer to the international date line,
banks in Singapore, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan and other Asian
countries will witness the calendar transition in computer systems
before much of the rest of the world.
	   Singapore banks are scheduled to open for business on Monday,
Jan. 3, 2000.

EU Clears Volkswagen's purchase of Rolls Royce
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission cleared
Volkswagen AG's acquisition of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Ltd., saying
Tuesday it posed no antitrust problems anywhere in the 15-nation
European Union.
	   It said Volkswagen's increased luxury car market share after the
purchase of Rolls Royce, ``does not exceed 5 percent in any of the
15 EU member states.''
	   The German automaker will gain the right to make Bentley and
Cosworth luxury brand cars.
	   But the purchase from Britain's defense and propulsion company
Vickers PLC doesn't include rights to the Rolls-Royce brand name
and logo. These are held by the British jet engine maker
Rolls-Royce PLC.
	   Under a deal with VW, German car maker Bayerische Motoren Werke
AG bought the Rolls Royce name for dlrs 66 million in August from
Rolls-Royce PLC, its partner in an aerospace venture.
	   It will let VW use it for free until Dec. 31, 2002. Thereafter,
VW will market its luxury car under the Bentley brand, whereas BMW
will produce and sell the Rolls-Royce name.
	   However Rolls-Royce Motors retains rights to the imposing
radiator grille and elegant ``flying lady'' radiator ornament that
are considered key to the Rolls brand identity.
	   Volkswagen's purchase of Rolls-Royce Motors marks yet another
acquisition in a fast-consolidating industry. Other recent moves
include another purchase by Volkswagen _ of Lamborghini _ and
Germany's Daimler-Benz AG agreement to purchase Chrysler Corp. of
the United States.

under way to defuse protest

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Keeping up pressure on Cambodian
leader Hun Sen, 3,000 people maintained a protest Tuesday in front
of the National Assembly and cheered calls by opposition leader
Prince Norodom Ranariddh demanding his ouster.
	   It was the third protest against Cambodia's strongman in as many
days, and officials in his government called it ``illegal'' and
unauthorized.
	   Crowds blocked roads and crammed inside a park in front of the
assembly, where 100 people spent Monday night in a vigil to protest
alleged fraud in last month's parliamentary elections.
	   Their numbers rose and fell Tuesday, with some drifting off as
heavy rains pelted the park and others ducking for cover under
makeshift tents or trees.
	   ``This is an outlawed demonstration,'' said Khieu Sopheak, an
Interior Ministry spokesman. ``But since it is illegal, if
something happens, how can the competent authorities be
responsible?''
	   Interior Minister Sar Kheng met with Lakhan Mehrotra, the U.N.
special representative to Cambodia, to try to find a way out of the
round-the-clock vigil, which has raised fears of new violence.
	   The park was the site of a grenade attack against a protest led
by opposition politician Sam Rainsy in March 1997. Sixteen people
died and more than 100 were wounded in the attack, which Sam Rainsy
blamed on Hun Sen.
	   Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party won 64 of the 122 seats in
the National Assembly in the July 26 poll, short of the two-thirds
majority needed to form a government.
	   Opposition parties have accused the CPP of perpetrating
widespread fraud in the balloting and counting process and have
said they will boycott any attempts by Hun Sen to form a ruling
coalition.
	   The crowd exploded Tuesday when Ranariddh, president of the
leading opposition FUNCINPEC party, arrived to greet them for the
first time. He returned from Bangkok, where he had spent the last
10 days, Monday afternoon
	   ``Hun Sen said he is (a man) of the people,'' Ranariddh shouted
toward the sea of faces from the top of a pickup truck. ``He should
listen to the people and step down.''
	   Hun Sen ousted Ranariddh as his co-prime minister in a violent
coup in July 1997. As many as 100 of his loyalists were killed in
the months that followed.
	   Hun Sen called for new elections to win back legitimacy and aid
lost after his violent takeover.
	   The prince warned Tuesday that Hun Sen's time in power is
running out.
	   The mandate of the current National Assembly expires Sept. 24,
he said, proposing that his father, King Norodom Sihanouk,
intervene and form a caretaker government until a new election can
be held.
	   ``On July 26, the people did not vote for Hun Sen but for
democrats,'' the prince shouted to the crowd, wiping sweat from his
forehead. ``We are not going anywhere. We will stay here to demand
justice.''
	   More than dlrs 3,000 in donations have been collected from
supporters, market vendors, pedicab drivers and students to keep
the vigil going.
	   Sam Rainsy, whose party finished third in the elections, said if
there are any efforts by police to forcibly remove protesters they
will peacefully resist by lying limply on the ground.

British Airways says it will buy Airbus

<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France AP) _ In a move certain to rattle the Boeing
Co., British Airways said Tuesday it will order its first batch of
jets from Europe's Airbus Industrie.
	   At a press conference at the Toulouse airport attended by
British Prime Minister Tony Blair and French transport minister
Jean-Claude Gayssot, Airbus President Noel Forgeard called the sale
``a most remarkable event in Airbus history.''
	   British Airways, which Forgeard called ``a very seasoned and
demanding customer,'' will buy 59 short-haul jets in the A320
family, with options to buy another 129.
	   While most European airlines have bought from Airbus _ a
consortium made up of aerospace companies from Britain, France,
Spain and Germany _ British Airways has long been one of Boeing's
most loyal customers.
	   BA chief executive Bob Ayling acknowledged Tuesday's deal would
disappoint Boeing.
	   ``I know Boeing, being the company they are, will come back,''
he told reporters before the press conference.
	   Asked if he thought choosing a European supplier would help BA
get European Union approval for its controversial alliance with
American Airlines, Ayling indicated the decision was purely
commercial.
	   ``I don't think it will make any difference,'' he said.
``British Airways bought these aircraft because they offered us the
best value.''
	   Despite the partial defection to Airbus, British Airways said it
still plans to fly lots of Boeings, keeping the Seattle-based
company as its supplier for larger jets.
	   In a statement, the airline said it will buy 16 Boeing 777s,
with options for 16 more.
	   ``We never like to lose any campaign, but this was hard-fought
and one we knew would be difficult from the beginning,'' Boeing
spokeswoman Janice Hayes in Brussels said of the Airbus order.
``Airbus won half a victory.''
	   Hayes said the British Airways move would not result any job
losses at Boeing.
	   The list price of the new aircraft BA is ordering comes to 3
billion pounds (dlrs 5 billion), although the company did not
disclose the exact price it is paying.
	   ``We have ordered the right aircraft at the right time at the
right price,'' Ayling said. ``This is a great investment in our
future, made possible by the commercial success of British
Airways.''
	   The big British airline has never purchased any airplanes
directly from Airbus, although it now has 10 in its fleet that came
with the acquisition of a smaller airline several years ago.
	   British Airways announced in February that it would be buying a
new batch of short-haul jets to replace airplanes now flown from
its bases in Manchester, Birmingham and London Gatwick, as well as
for its French and German subsidiaries, Air Liberte and Deutsche
BA.
	   British Airways plans to rearrange its mix of large Boeing jets,
using slightly smaller versions on some long-haul routes, according
to an industry source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   British Airways now flies to dozens of cities all over the world
using Boeing 747 jumbo jets, but in the future it will shift more
services to smaller jets such as the Boeing 777, the source said.

1 million visitors expected at Germany's largest wine festival
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ ``No beer allowed'' is the motto at
Germany's biggest wine festival, the Stuttgart Weindorf, which
opens Wednesday.
	   About 1 million wine-lovers from around the world are expected
in Stuttgart, the capital of the southwestern state of
Baden-Wuerttemberg, during the 12-day festival.
	   Some 250 types of wine will be available for sniffing and
sipping, including the Swabian national beverage, the red
Trollinger. Visitors can sit in the shade of 120 trellises set up
around the town square, organizers said Tuesday.
	   Every stand must offer at least one type of wine at 5.80 marks
(dlrs 3.25) a glass, which visitors are advised to bring with them.
	   Because of past problems with loud music, bands will only be
allowed to play without electric amplifiers. And organizers said
serving beer is, of course, taboo during the event.

Former French prime minister under investigation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DENIS BOULARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A judge on Tuesday placed former French Prime
Minister Alain Juppe under formal investigation _ a step short of
being charged _ for an alleged role in a fake employment scandal
while he served at Paris' city hall, judicial sources said.
	   Judge Patrick Desmure is investigating a system under which
workers on the city hall payroll were actually working for the
conservative Rally for the Republic party, which President Jacques
Chirac founded and to which Juppe belonged.
	   Chirac was mayor, and Juppe's boss, during the period under
investigation.
	   Also placed under investigation Tuesday was Michel Roussin,
Chirac's former chief assistant while he was mayor, the judicial
sources said on condition of anonymity.
	   The Paris mayor's office has been a hotbed of scandal for years.
	   In May, police detained the wife of Jean Tiberi, the current
mayor, for questioning about a payment she received for writing a
report commissioned by one of her husband's political allies.
	   Juppe also has been touched by scandal in the past. While prime
minister, he was undermined by revelations that he used city funds
to renovate his apartment when he was the city of Paris' finance
director from 1989-1993.
	   His son was found to be living in a city-owned apartment for
very low rent. Both were forced to move after a public outcry in
1995.
	   Juppe resigned as prime minister in 1997 after the conservatives
were badly defeated by the left in parliamentary elections.

	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ A bomb exploded on a bus bound for
Kigali, Rwanda, killing at least 30 passengers, a private radio
station said Tuesday.
	   The police had no immediate comment on the report.
	   Capital FM said the explosion occurred after the bus had left
Kampala and was on the main highway between Masaka and Mbarara on
the way to the Rwandan capital.
	   The radio did not say when the explosion occurred, but it did
say the injured had been taken to hospital in Mbarara, 282
kilometers (175 miles) southwest of Kampala.
	   An employee at the hospital's blood bank, reached by telephone,
said the explosion occurred about 9 a.m. (0600gmt) and that there
were ``many injured'' in the hospital. He spoke on condition of
anonymity.

Embassy resumes full operations after terrorist threats

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to remove periods from slug line

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The U.S. Embassy resumed full
operations Tuesday after limiting public access for several weeks
due to possible terrorist attacks.
	   Visa services have returned to normal, while the public will be
able to enter the Lincoln library when it reopens next Saturday,
the embassy said in a statement.
	   ``The Embassy is very grateful to the Government of Malaysia for
its quick and full responses to the Embassy's security concerns,''
it said.
	   Recently, about a dozen U.S. embassies worldwide found
themselves either shut down or unable to provide normal services
following the car-bomb explosions at missions in Kenya and
Tanzania, which killed at least 250 people.
	   Besides installing razor-tipped barbed wire atop its high walls,
the U.S. Embassy hastily paid off and shut down a gas station next
to the compound to prevent any attempts by terrorists to use it as
a bombing base.
	   Further precautions were taken by embassies after U.S. ships
late Thursday fired Tomahawk cruise missiles at a suspected
terrorist sites in Sudan and Afghanistan.
	   Last Friday, the U.S. Embassy here issued a State Department
bulletin cautioning U.S. citizens living in Malaysia to watch out
for suspicious vehicles, parcel bombs and to drive with their
windows up and doors locked.

Spanish club Espanyol refuses to free new Argentine national coach
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BARCELONA, Spain (AP) _ Plans to have Marcelo Bielsa as
Argentina's new national team coach remained bogged down Tuesday
after Spanish first division side Espanyol insisted he should work
out his contract for this season with the club.
	   ``The club is sticking by its position that I should stay and I
by mine that I should go,'' Bielsa said told reporters after a
marathon overnight round of talks with Espanyol representatives. No
date was set for the next round of talks.
	   The disagreement comes as the Spanish league prepares to kick
off this weekend.
	   Bielsa, who took over Espanyol earlier this summer, was this
month appointed Argentine national coach, replacing Daniel
Passarella who was removed following the side's disappointing World
Cup performance.
	   A former player, he has coached Argentine club Newell's Old Boys
and Mexico's Atlas and America teams. Last season, he steered
Argentina's Velez Sarsfield to win the league title.

Retired Greek American newspaper publisher dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Solon G. Vlasto, publisher of what was
once the largest Greek newspaper in the United States, has died of
natural causes. He was 94.
	   Media here reported Tuesday that Vlasto, who published the
Greek-language daily Atlantis in New York, died Monday in an Athens
retirement home 25 years after returning to his native land.
	   Vlasto was born in Athens and moved to the United States in 1918
where he went to work at Atlantis, owned by his uncle Solon J.
Vlasto. It was founded in 1894.
	   Starting as a copy boy, Vlasto worked his way through the ranks
and took over as publisher in 1944. The newspaper was willed to him
by his uncle. It once had a peak circulation of 22,000 in the
1950's, but foundered and shut down in 1973.
	   New York is still home to the two largest Greek-language dailies
published in the United States, the National Herald and Proini.
	   Vlasto retired to his parents home in the northern Athens suburb
of Kifissia in 1973.
	   He is survived by his son James Vlasto of New York city and
George Vlasto of Kent, Connecticut.
	   Funeral arrangements were not known.

Philippine Airlines to resume flights to Asia, Middle East,
</HEADLINE>
Australia &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine Airlines, which has been
gradually recovering from recent strikes, will resume flights to
Asia, Australia and the Middle East, an airline official said
Tuesday.
	   The airline expects its losses to continue in the next few
months mainly because it has lease payments on unused planes
waiting to be returned to aircraft leasing companies, said Senior
Vice President Avelino Zapanta.
	   Zapanta said passenger loads were improving and the airline was
focusing on recovery work after the devastating strikes by pilots
and ground crew that nearly drove the Philippine flag carrier to
closure.
	   ``We didn't like the feeling of being there at the brink of
extinction so we have resolved to do everything so we won't return
in the same place again,'' Zapanta said.
	   By October, PAL will resume weekly flights to Xiamen in China,
Brunei and between the central Philippine city of Cebu and Osaka,
Japan. It would also add a third flight each week to Fukuoka,
Japan.
	   The airline is also planning to resume flights to Riyadh and
Dahran in Saudi Arabia and to Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane in
Australia by November or December, he said.
	   PAL also plans to resume flights to southern Cotabato city and
Dumaguete city in central Negros island. A flight between two trade
hubs, central Cebu city and the southern port city of Davao, is
being considered.
	   Zapanta said the airline has enough planes and pilots for the
flight resumptions.
	   The pilots' union of PAL staged a crippling 22-day strike last
June and its ground crew union walked out for a week in July,
worsening losses dealt by the effects of Asia's currency storm.
	   At the height of the pilots' strike, the airline laid off 5,000
workers, triggering the walkout by the ground personnel. PAL fired
all the striking pilots after they ignored a government
return-to-work order and many reapplied as new hires.
	   The strike set back an ambitious dlrs 4 billion modernization
program and forced PAL to drastically reduce operations, including
suspension of flights to several international and domestic routes.
	   PAL says it is unable to make payments on about dlrs 2 billion
of debt and is discussing a rehabilitation program with Manila's
Securities and Exchange Commission.
	   Under the rehabilitation plan, PAL is slashing its work force,
disposing of 40 of its 54 planes, suspending more than two-thirds
of its routes and selling some subsidiaries.
	   The commission also allowed the airline to defer payments on
financial obligations worth dlrs 2 billion.
	   PAL officials say the 57-year-old airline lost more than dlrs 50
million in revenue because of the pilots' strike.

Indonesian police scuffle with workers protesting in the capital

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Police blocked about 300 workers from
marching in the streets of Jakarta during a protest for labor
rights on Tuesday. At least a dozen demonstrators were slightly
injured.
	   The workers, mostly women, were holding a second consecutive day
of protest outside the office of the Indonesian Legal Aid
Foundation, a human rights group.
	   They tried to march to the office of the International Labor
Organization office, but police with rattan shields, sticks and
helmets surrounded the workers and stopped them. Scuffles broke out
and some women were scratched and bruised.
	   The workers were demanding higher salaries and protesting what
they said was intervention by the military in labor disputes. The
demonstrators were from the city of Solo, 400 kilometers (250
miles) east of Jakarta, the capital.
	   Since the resignation of autocratic President Suharto in May,
the new government has instituted democratic reforms, including the
right to form labor unions. It has also freed labor activists
jailed for opposing Suharto during his 32-year rule.
	   Also Tuesday, about 500 student demonstrators marched in
downtown Jakarta, demanding that Suharto's successor, President
B.J. Habibie, lower the price of staple foods. Indonesia is
enduring economic turmoil and prices have soared.
	   ``People are hungry, don't wait until they get angry,'' the
students chanted as they marched down a main street in an affluent
neighborhood.
	   As part of its reform, the government has allowed protesters
greater freedom to demonstrate. But they have been more lenient
with students than with workers, possibly fearing labor protests
are more likely to create instability.

NATO investigators find no evidence of child prostitution
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ NATO has found no evidence
to support a Spanish newspaper's account of its soldiers running a
child prostitution ring in Bosnia, alliance officials said Tuesday.
	   El Mundo reported in May that Italian, Portuguese and Egyptian
soldiers forced girls ages 12 to 14 to have sex with them at their
base in Sarajevo.
	   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana dismissed the allegations
immediately after they were published and the command of NATO-led
forces in Bosnia launched an investigation.
	   ``The allegations by the El Mundo reporter were without merit
and the investigation is closed,'' said Maj. Sheena Thomson, the
spokeswoman for the NATO-led peace force.
	   El Mundo had claimed that the Spanish secret service, CESID,
made the discovery last summer and made an exhaustive report to the
agency head, Javier Calderon.
	   But the Spanish Secret Service has denied any such report about
the involvement of NATO soldiers in a child prostitution network in
Sarajevo and drug deals in the southern Bosnian city of Mostar, she
said.
	   More than 90 people in Bosnia, Croatia and Italy were
interviewed by the investigation team, including former peace force
unit commanders, soldiers, members of non-governmental and
international organizations, civilian employees, local and
international police authorities and individuals mentioned in El
Mundo's article, she said.

Serbs accused of killing three charity workers in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from UNHCR, Amnesty International, Hill
meeting Milosevic &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police, on the offensive in
Kosovo, were accused Tuesday of killing three ethnic Albanian
workers for the Mother Teresa charity who were taking humanitarian
aid to refugees.
	   The latest report of violence came amid a storm of new
international criticism of the Serbs for their attacks in
secessionist Kosovo.
	   The ethnic Albanian daily Koha Ditore said the three were killed
Monday after police allowed them to pass through a checkpoint near
Malisevo, a former rebel stronghold in central Kosovo that Serb
forces overran last month.
	   Citing eyewitnesses, Koha Ditore said police subsequently
shelled the tractor they were riding on to take aid into the
region, one of the most densely refugee-populated in the war-torn
province of southern Serbia.
	   The Albanians' Kosovo Information Center gave a similar account.
But the Pristina branch of the Mother Teresa charitable foundation
said it could not confirm the deaths because it had no
communication with field crews.
	   The foundation has been distributing wheat flour, soap and other
aid provided by the World Food Program and the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees. Humanitarian agencies estimate about
50,000 Kosovo refugees are trying to survive in the open.
	   As U.S. envoy Christopher Hill prepared to meet Tuesday in
Belgrade with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, there were new
reports of fighting and more condemnation of the Serbs.
	   Serbian police and the Yugoslav army continued shelling several
villages southwest of Pristina in their drive to crush separatist
resistance among Kosovo's majority ethnic Albanians.
	   According to the Kosovo Information Center, after killing three
ethnic Albanians in clashes Monday the Serbs were targeting seven
villages in the Suva Reka region on Tuesday and were setting ablaze
houses after dousing them with gasoline.
	   ``We denounce the continuing violence in Kosovo which is forcing
more people to flee,'' spokesman Kris Janowski of the UNHCR said
Tuesday in Geneva. ``The situation is getting worse and worse.''
	   He said the U.N. agency is planning to double its staff in
Pristina to around 14 but has been hindered by delays in obtaining
visas from Belgrade authorities.
	   Amnesty International also deplored the violence, and called
attention to both the vulnerability of women to human rights abuses
in Kosovo and the rising number of victims who have gone missing.
	   ``The disappeared and missing are the hidden victims of
Kosovo,'' the London-based human rights group said. It said all
ethnic groups are affected: ``Ethnic Albanians have disappeared in
Serbian police hands; Serbs, Albanians and Roma are missing after
abduction by the KLA.''
	   In New York on Monday, the U.N. Security Council urged a
cease-fire in the Yugoslav province and warned of a humanitarian
disaster if fighting continues. But the statement reflected the
lack of any consensus among council members on how to halt the
conflict.
	   ``The authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the
Kosovo Albanians must achieve a political solution to the issue of
Kosovo,'' the 15-member council said in a statement. It said that
as winter approaches, the plight of refugees will worsen.
	   The Serbs, meanwhile, accused the ethnic Albanians' Kosovo
Liberation Army of making more guerrilla attacks against them. The
pro-Serb Media Center said a group of rebels ambushed an ambulance
on Monday, wounding the driver, a doctor and another passenger.

Iraq's Foreign Minister leaves for South Africa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) - Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed
al-Sahhaf left Tuesday on his way to South Africa to attend
preparations for a Non-Aligned Movement summit meeting, the Iraqi
news agency said.
	   Al-Sahhaf will also meet with his counterparts to discuss the
summit's agenda and ``strengthen bilateral relations with their
countries,'' INA said.
	   Al-Sahhaf left by road for neighboring Jordan because of the
U.N. ban on air travel in and out of Iraq. He will fly from the
Jordanian capital Amman to Cairo, where he is expected to meet
Wednesday with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa.
	   It is unclear how long al-Sahhaf will remain in South Africa.
Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan is expected to attend the
summit scheduled Aug. 29-Sept.3 in the coastal city of Durban.
	   The United Nations imposed sweeping air, arms and trade
sanctions against Iraq after Baghdad's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The
sanctions will only be lifted after U.N. arms inspectors certify
that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction.
	   Earlier this month, South Africa said it would establish
diplomatic relations within weeks because it wants the Gulf country
to attend the NAM summit.
	   Reports in South Africa suggested restoring relations would help
clear up a nearly dlrs 164 million debt that Iraq owes for weapons
it bought from South Africa's arms industry during apartheid rule.

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Portugal insisted Tuesday that it, the
United States and Russia play a vital role in monitoring the
Angolan peace process and expressed optimism the African nation's
rebel group would reverse its decision to sever contacts with them.
	   The rebel group UNITA announced Monday it was cutting all ties
with the three observer countries accusing them of being biased
toward the Angolan government in implementing a U.N.-brokered 1994
peace accord that ended a two-decade civil war.
	   Cooperation with the observer nations was ``essential'' for the
Angolan peace process, the Portuguese Foreign Ministry said in a
statement.
	   UNITA ``surely will take this into consideration, strengthening
its collaboration with the United Nations rather than doing the
opposite,'' the statement said.
	   There was no official reaction to UNITA's announcement from
either the other observer countries or the U.N..
	   UNITA claimed the observers countries were acting in their own
economic interests in this oil- and diamond-rich country and
specifically accused Portugal, which ruled Angola up to its
independence in 1975, of having a ``colonial attitude.''
	   The U.N. Security Council has accused UNITA of dragging its feet
in implementing the peace deal and has imposed sanctions against
the group.
	   UNITA says it remains committed to the peace pact which has been
stymied by lingering hostility between the former foes. Its
implementation is more than a year behind schedule.

Opposition rejects warning from military government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with opposition rejecting government warning &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ The opposition led by Nobel laureate Aung
San Suu Kyi on Tuesday rejected threats from the military regime to
back down on calls for a civilian parliament to be convened or risk
long prison sentences.
	   ``To call a parliament is not in contravention of any existing
law, but in the long-term interest of the state and the people and
in accordance with the law,'' the National League for Democracy
said in a statement.
	   The government's warning came during an extremely rare meeting
Monday between officials _ mostly high-ranking security figures _
and two members of the central executive committee of Suu Kyi's
party, the NLD.
	   Official newspapers Tuesday carried brief, back-page accounts of
the meeting and noted that Home Affairs Minister Col. Tin Hlaing
told the NLD members ``to avoid acts which will undermine stability
and peace and the rule of law in the country.''
	   Tin Oo, an NLD vice chairman, said the officials had read out a
1996 law that makes demonstrations or acts undermining a
constitutional convention punishable by five to 20 years in prison.
A party violating it would be declared illegal.
	   The warning came hours after the first street protest by student
demonstrations in nearly two years. At the same time, Suu Kyi ended
a 13-day roadside standoff against authorities, who stopped her
from meeting supporters in the provinces.
	   Suu Kyi, 53, was believed to be meeting with party officials
Tuesday at her home. About 40 members of the party milled about the
group's downtown headquarters, awaiting word of her health.
	   In Thailand, members of parliament from Australia, Denmark,
Malaysia, the Netherlands, Norway, the Philippines, South Korea and
Sri Lanka gathered and urged Myanmar's military to negotiate with
Suu Kyi and insurgent ethnic minorities.
	   ``The military should be aware that the international community
will hold them responsible if any harm comes to this special
lady,'' said Helle Degn, chairwoman of the Danish parliament's
foreign policy committee.
	   The NLD had urged Suu Kyi to end her test of wills with the
government and return home from a bridge 32 kilometers (19 miles)
outside Yangon, where her van had been stopped since Aug. 12.
	   Her doctors had said she was suffering from kidney and urinary
tract problems, low blood pressure and dizziness. Tin Oo said
Monday that she was feeling the effects of dehydration and possible
shock from low blood sugar levels.
	   Uniformed police stationed near the U.S. Embassy were increased
amid rumors that demonstrators would attempt to stage hit-and-run
protests against the Myanmar government. None was confirmed.
	   A government spokesman, on condition of anonymity, said it was
``calm and peaceful in Yangon and elsewhere in the country.''
	   The demonstration Monday by about 200 students at a street
intersection was the first since December 1996, when several days
of student protests demanding more civil liberties were quelled by
the closure of the universities. They remain closed.
	   It was the most open display of public discontent this month,
which marks the 10th anniversary of a national uprising against
military rule that was brutally crushed by troops, killing about
3,000 people.
	   Suu Kyi has raised the profile of her struggle to bring more
democracy to Myanmar, also known as Burma, this month and has
demanded that the military convene the parliament that was elected
in a vote allowed eight years ago.
	   The military, which has ruled since 1962, never honored the
result after Suu Kyi's party won in a landslide.
	   Official newspapers said in a commentary Tuesday that no
parliament could be called until a constitutional convention _
which has not met for two years _ drafts a new charter.
	   The NLD pulled out in 1995, declaring the military had stacked
the process to keep its grip on power. The constitution-drafting
process was launched only after the 1990 election.

Israeli helicopter strike kills guerrilla in south Lebanon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS first name of slain guerrilla to Hossam, UPDATES with
one SLA militiaman killed &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli helicopter gunships rocketed a car
near this southern port city on Tuesday, killing a military
official of the Shiite Muslim guerrilla group Amal, security
officials said.
	   Hossam al-Amin, 31, was killed when a single rocket hit his
vehicle Tuesday afternoon on the coastal road about 12 kilometers
(8 miles) south of Tyre, said the Lebanese officials, speaking on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   Two helicopter gunships flew in from the sea and attacked the
car, a blue BMW sedan, as it drove in the area, about 15 kilometers
(10 miles) north of the Israeli border and about one kilometers
(less than a mile) from a checkpoint of U.N. peacekeepers deployed
in the region.
	   The dead man was identified as an Amal military official in the
south. The pro-Syrian Amal, one of several guerrilla groups
fighting Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon, is led by Lebanese
Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri.
	   Amal activists collected the body from the smoldering car less
than an hour after the attack.
	   Israel has in the past used helicopter gunships to hunt down
commanders of Shiite guerrillas who are fighting to dislodge
Israel's occupation army from a border zone in southern Lebanon.
	   In February 1992, Israeli helicopters destroyed a guerrilla
motorcade, killing Sheik Abbas Musawi, the secretary general of
Hezbollah, the Shiite movement leading the guerrilla war in the
south.
	   Last week, three Israeli soldiers were killed in two separate
attacks by guerrillas in the south.
	   Elsewhere on the front line in the south, an Israeli-backed
militiaman was killed in a guerrilla attack earlier in the day, the
security officials said.
	   The militiaman of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia
was killed in a roadside bomb near Jezzine. Rocket and artillery
exchanges ensued between the raiding guerrillas of the Shiite
Hezbollah and the SLA garrison, said the officials.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the
attack on a mountain outpost outside Jezzine on the northern edge
of the Israeli-occupied zone in the south and some 30 kilometers
(20 miles) from the Israeli border.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ An aide to a Communist lawmaker was shot to death
on a street in southwestern Moscow on Tuesday, a news report said.
	   Igor Surnin, 31, was wearing a bullet-proof vest at the time of
his death, the Interfax news agency reported, citing the Moscow
police. Police found three used shotgun cartridges at the scene,
the Interfax news agency said.
	   Surnin was an aide to Communist lawmaker Valery Tarasov,
Interfax said.
	   Many Russian lawmakers, especially hard-liners, have hundreds of
aides who enjoy the perks and benefits that the position offers.
Shootings of lawmakers' aides have become common and police have
said that several of the victims had criminal records.
	   Earlier this month, an aide to another Communist lawmaker, Darya
Mitina, was shot to death along with four other people in an
apartment in a Moscow suburb.
	   No motive for Surnin's killing was given. Four suspected
attackers fled in a Mercedes automobile, which police later found
two blocks from the site of the shooting. They also found an
automatic rifle in the car.

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ A Myanmar Airways domestic flight missing
with 33 people aboard is believed to have crash-landed in a rice
field in Laos, a government official said Tuesday.
	   A family member of one of the crew members, insisting on
anonymity, said she had been contacted by Transport Ministry
officials Tuesday and told that all 29 passengers and four crew
were fine.
	   Other details were not immediately available.
	   The Fokker Friendship aircraft was on a flight Monday from
Yangon to the northern city of Tachilek when the crew contacted the
Tachilek control tower and complained of poor weather.
	   Shortly afterward, contact was lost and Myanmar authorities
mounted a search and rescue operation. There were no foreigners on
board. Two of the passengers were infants.
	   Tachilek, 560 kilometers (350 miles) north of Yangon, straddles
the border with Thailand in the remote, opium-rich Golden Triangle,
where the borders of Myanmar, Thailand and Laos converge.
	   The area is extremely rugged and isolated and communication is
difficult.

Germany: Japan more worrying than Russia for economic growth
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Japan's economic problems are more of a
burden on Germany's economic upswing than the financial turmoil in
Russia, the German Economics Ministry said Tuesday.
	   Government officials nevertheless urged Russia to stick to its
reform course and promised continued German support to prevent the
problems there from getting worse.
	   ``When it comes to the reforms, there's no way back, only
forward,'' Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel wrote in Tuesday's Bild
newspaper.
	   Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt told German radio that Bonn
would continue to support German trade and investment in Russia.
	   ``I much prefer a Russia that we accompany into the market
economy to a Russia that stumbles and collapses,'' he said.
	   German commercial banks have more than dlrs 30 billion in
outstanding loans to Russia, the most of any country by far. The
German government has guaranteed most of the loans.
	   In its monthly report, issued Tuesday, the Economics Ministry
said the negative effects of Russia's financial crisis on Germany's
economic growth ``will be limited.''
	   It called Japan's economic and financial crisis ``a burdening
factor,'' but added higher domestic demand and the European
economic upswing will balance the negative effects of both crises.
	   Only a small fraction of Germany's exports go to the countries
affected by the financial crises, it said.
	   Exports to southeast Asian nations were significantly lower than
last year, but exports to the European Union, North America and
especially eastern European countries rose significantly, the
ministry noted.

Magistrate dismisses defense request to release suspect
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GEORGE MWANGI &QC;

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ A magistrate on Tuesday dismissed an
application from the defense to release from jail a senior game
warden arrested more than a month ago in connection with the 1988
murder of British tourist Julie Ward.
	   Magistrate Uniter Kidullah adjourned the court until Sept. 1
when another hearing was expected.
	   She said Simon ole Makallah had not been formally charged by the
court and therefore, the court had no power to discharge him or
dismiss the charges. She said only the High Court had that power.
	   Kidullah has granted several prosecution requests for more time
to put a case together before formal charges are filed and Makallah
is called to enter a plea.
	   Makallah, a senior warden in the Kenya Wildlife Service, was
arrested July 17. The following day, Attorney General Amos Wako,
flanked by Ward's father, John, said there was sufficient
circumstantial evicence to arraign the suspect and hold a second
trial in the murder of the 28-year-old Ward, whose burned corpse
was found in the Maasai Mara National Reserve in September 1988.
	   Makallah has not yet been required to enter a plea although he
has been held in jail for a month.
	   Ward's mutilated and charred remains were discovered in the
reserve on the Tanzanian border Sept. 13, 1988. Officials first
claimed she had been attacked and killed by wild animals.
	   Two park rangers were subsequently arrested and tried for her
murder, but they were found innocent of all charges in June 1992.
Justice Fidahussein Abdullah criticized the police for conducting a
flawed investigation.
	   On March 2, 1996, Wako agreed that new information about the
killing made another ``fair and objective'' investigation
necessary.
	   Ward, a wealthy hotelier from Bury St. Edmunds, England, has
carried on a 10-year campaign to find his daughter's killers and
have them brought to justice.

Tajik opposition continues integration into government forces
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ELKHOM NARDIEV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ The government and the opposition
have entered the last stage of integrating their troops, with more
opposition fighters swearing loyalty to the Tajik armed forces on
Tuesday.
	   The integration of the opposition into government forces is part
of a peace accord signed last year. Nearly 4,000 opposition
fighters have taken the oath so far, and the remaining,
approximately 1,000 ex-rebels in Tajikistan were expected to do so
in the next few days, said opposition spokesman Sulton Khamadov.
	   However, some 250 opposition fighters remain stranded in
neighboring Afghanistan, with their return delayed because of the
withdrawal of U.N. observers who must oversee the repatriation.
	   The United Nations decided Monday to recall all non-essential
foreign staff from Tajikistan in response to the government's
failure to arrest suspects in last month's killing of U.N. workers.
	   The government announced last week that it had identified four
suspects in the killing. The suspects were on the territory
controlled by the opposition, and the government said it was
negotiating for their arrest. But a week later, the suspects remain
free.
	   Khamadov said that last week's order by opposition leader Said
Abdullo Nuri for his field commanders to seize the suspects and
turn them over to the government had been delayed for ``technical
reasons'' and did not reach the field commanders in time.
	   However, the suspects are now expected to be arrested ``in a
matter of days,'' Khamadov said.
	   The four U.N. workers were ambushed July 20 while on a regular
patrol in the mountains about 90 miles (140 kilometers) east of the
capital Dushanbe. All were shot in the the head.
	   Despite the 1997 peace accord that ended the former Soviet
republic's five-year civil war, Tajikistan remains restive. There
are periodic clashes between the hard-line government and the
mostly Islamic opposition. Also, many warlords do not recognize the
peace deal and wage turf battles with one another.

	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ A grenade exploded Tuesday on a bus bound
for Kigali, Rwanda, causing a collision and at least 20 deaths, a
Mbarara district spokeswoman said.
	   The spokeswoman, who identified herself only as Tumwine A., said
the exploding granade caused the bus to crash into a mini-van and
said at least 20 people had been killed.
	   It was not immediately clear how many died in the explosion and
how many were killed as a result of the crash.
	   Capital FM radio reported at least 30 were killed on the Kampala
to Kigali bus in the explosion that occurred on the main highway
between Masaka and Mbarara.
	   In Mbarara, 282 kilometers (175 miles) southwest of Kampala,
workers at Mbarara Hospital said the injured began arriving around
11 a.m. (0800 GMT). At least 10 were admitted for treatment,
several in surgery, according to the hospital superintendent, who
would not give his name.
	   He said it was possible the number of dead was greater than the
number of injured.
	   ``We have not yet assessed whether it was the impact of the
explosion or of the collision,'' that caused most of the injuries,
the superintendent said.

Nigerian leader reaffirms commitment to democracy

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Nigeria's new military leader on
Tuesday reaffirmed his commitment to handing over power to an
elected civilian government by May 29, 1999.
	   Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar told parliament that military rule was
no longer acceptable in his country.
	   ``We have now unequivocally chosen democracy as our preferred
option of governance,'' he said. ``Nigerians want nothing less than
true democracy in a united and peaceful country.''
	   Abubakar addressed lawmakers during a first state visit to South
Africa by a Nigerian leader.
	   Abubakar's predecessor, Gen. Sani Abacha, died of a heart attack
in June, ending five years of brutal rule and defiance of world
condemnation for usurping democratic elections.
	   Abubakar has pledged to hold elections in May next year and
return the country to civilian rule.
	   On his first offical overseas trip since taking power in
Africa's most populous state of 105 million people, Abubakar
expressed concern about regional flashpoints such as a border war
between Eritrea and Ethiopia and a rebellion in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo.
	   He said Nigeria and South Africa should form an axis of power to
promote peace and stability on the continent and strengthen
international groups like the Organization of African Unity.
	   ``Relations between Nigeria and South Africa should always be
that of cooperation and not rivalry, concord and not disharmony,
friendship and not antagonism,'' he said ``We are the torchbearers
of the new Africa.''
	   Earlier Abubakar, choosing to don a bright blue gown instead of
a military uniform, walked into parliament with Deputy President
Thabo Mbeki, President Nelson Mandela's likely successor when he
steps down next year.

Prime minister ready to pay high interest rates on foreign debt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia will consider paying
lofty interest rates on future foreign loans if that helps efforts
to boost the nation's faltering economy, Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad said Tuesday.
	   ``We guarantee that we will repay our loans and even pre-pay
them,'' he told a crowd of supporters during a political rally in
Selangor state.
	   Foreign lenders who are doubtful about getting repaid will not
be forced to lend money to Malaysia, said Mahathir.
	   Instead, the country is ready to toil on its own to set the
economy on the recovery path, he said.
	   ``We are still free. This shows that the government knows how to
manage the country,'' Mahathir said.
	   Mahathir has been touring the nation in recent weeks in an
effort to muster political support in meet-the-people rallies that
have focused on efforts to revive the economy.
	   An ambitious plan to recycle the private sector's mounting bad
debts was recently undermined after two international rating
agencies downgraded Malaysia's credit ratings.
	   One of them, Moody's Investors Service, slashed its rating to
just two notches above junk bond status.
	   The downgrades forced Malaysia to postpone a dlrs 2 billion bond
issue which would have helped finance Danaharta, a
government-backed bank that's supposed to mop up bad debts accrued
by local financial institutions.
	   Mahathir, nonetheless, said his administration had a firm grip
on the Malaysian economy.
	   If the government had failed to properly manage the economy,
Malaysia would have long ago begged for money from the
International Monetary Fund, he said.
	   Despite the prime minister's comments, the country's flagship
commercial bank posted a drastic decline in profits.
	   Malayan Banking Ltd., the country's largest bank, said Tuesday
its net profit for the fiscal year ending in June plunged by 90
percent, the result of heavy provisioning against the threat of
rising bad-loan levels.
	   The bank reported net profit of only 130 million ringgit (dlrs
31 million) this year, down from 1.32 billion ringgit (dlrs 314
million) in 1997.
	   Some of the group's losses also came from its stockbroking
division, Mayban Securities, which chalked losses of 53.8 million
ringgit (dlrs 12.8 million) this year.
	   Share prices on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange have shed more
than 75 percent in value since February while Malaysia's currency,
the ringgit, has lost almost 40 percent of its value against the
U.S. dollar since July 1997.

Reserve Bank head says global turmoil has slowed growth
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAT REBER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Backing down on earlier
predictions of economic recovery, South African Reserve Bank
governor Chris Stals on Tuesday said financial turmoil has delayed
the country's economic upswing.
	   Stals spoke at the release of the bank's annual report in
Pretoria, where he said he was ``very concerned'' about
disappointing quarterly figures that showed economic growth had
dwindled to 0.3 percent, Dow Jones Newswires reported.
	   South Africa's financial sector has suffered from global effects
of the Asian economic crisis, combined with currency speculation
that drove the rand's value down by 23 percent this year.
	   Figures released on Monday showed that first quarter growth of
0.5 percent in gross domestic product had dropped to the equivalent
of 0.3 percent annual growth in the second quarter.
	   South Africa's economy grew by 1.7 percent in 1997, down from
3.2 percent in 1996.
	   A projected decline in the budget deficit from 5.4 percent to
4.3 percent contributed to the brighter economic outlook at year's
begin.
	   Stals said monetary policy would remain tight to combat an
annualized inflation rate of about 5 percent, a figure he said was
too high.

Investors await government decision on debt restructuring
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with debt restructuring plan under consideration,
UPGRADES attribution. Trims. &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Russia-Politics &QL; 
 &UR; By JUDITH INGRAM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin has
approved a plan to restructure dlrs 40 billion in short-term debt,
including more than dlrs 11 billion in bonds held by foreign
investors, a government spokesman said Tuesday.
	   The terms were to be announced later in the day, more than a
week after the government announced that the country's severe
economic crisis would force a debt restructuring, said Vadim
Birkin, spokesman for acting Deputy Prime Minister Boris Fyodorov.
	   The announcement has already been postponed twice, after foreign
investors protested that the restructuring would favor Russian
commercial banks.
	   The delay reflected Russia's political limbo following President
Boris Yeltsin's dismissal of Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko on
Sunday. On his first day in office, Chernomyrdin on Monday asked
the State Duma, the lower house of parliament, to set aside ``for
the time being'' a set of economic austerity measures that had been
demanded by international lenders and formulated by Kiriyenko's
team.
	   The ruble fell 10 percent in trading Tuesday, closing at 7.86 to
the dollar, down from 7.14 on Monday. Trading volume amounted to
dlrs 430 million.
	   The Central Bank has been selling dollars steadily in recent
sessions in an effort to slow the fall of the Russian currency. By
midday on Tuesday alone, it had already spent about dlrs 340
million to defend the ruble, traders said. Trading was suspended
twice on the interbank currency exchange when the bank was
overwhelmed by demand for dollars.
	   Stocks rose in thin trading, despite a steady absence of foreign
investors who were worried over the state debt restructuring plan.
	   The market activity was driven mostly by local investors,
speculating on quick moves in the stock prices after most Russian
blue chips plummeted amid recent financial turmoil.
	   At 2 p.m. (1000 GMT), the Russian Trading System index climbed
to 88.42 points, up 2.3 percent from Monday's close at 86.40
points.
	   Chernomyrdin was going over final details of the restructuring
plan on Tuesday afternoon, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. It
said that the government would offer several options, and that
foreigners and domestic investors would be treated equally.
	   Alexander Pochinok, chief of the government's department of
finances and credit regulations, said it would take about a month
to complete the restructuring of dlrs 40 billion worth of
outstanding bond issues, which officials had originally promised to
announce last week.
	   He said the plan still needs Yeltsin's approval, and that
details would be published only after Yeltsin issued a presidential
decree.
	   The Russian government defaulted on its treasury debt last week,
and announced that it would force investors to swap their paper for
new, presumably longer-term, obligations.
	   Investors are now expecting the government to offer them the
option of swapping into long-term dollar denominated paper with a
very modest return, or much higher-yielding paper denominated in
rubles.
	   Investors say a third option might allow them to keep their
existing treasuries to maturity, after which they would be given
new two-year ruble-denominated securities.

Israeli, Palestinian positions on U.S. withdrawal proposal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Israel-Palestinians
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Israel and the Palestinians have reported progress in
negotiations on an Israeli troop withdrawal in the West Bank, but
sticking points remain. Here are the positions of the two sides:
	   U.S. PROPOSAL FOR 13 PERCENT PULLBACK
	   Israel: Ready to hand over 10 percent, plus 3 percent of West
Bank land classified as nature reserve land in which Palestinians
would have no control over building and security.
	   Palestinians: Agree in principle to the 10-plus-3 formula, but
want Palestinian police to be deployed in the nature reserve.
	   REVOKING THE PLO FOUNDING CHARTER
	   Israel: Initially said it would not begin a troop pullback until
the 545-member Palestine National Council revokes charter clauses
calling for Israel's destruction. Israel now says willing to accept
a PNC vote at a later time.
	   Palestinians: Say the PNC voted to change the charter in 1996,
but that they are willing to have a smaller PLO body take new vote.
	   CRACKDOWN ON ISLAMIC MILITANTS
	   Israel: Has rejected a Palestinian-CIA agreement on security,
saying it does not contain guarantees that the Palestinians will
arrest and disarm Islamic militants.
	   Palestinians: Say they are making 100 percent effort, but cannot
be expected to be successful at all times in quelling terrorism.
	   FURTHER ISRAELI WITHDRAWALS
	   Israel: Says that after the upcoming pullback, it will hand over
only 1 percent more of the West Bank ahead of a permanent peace
agreement with the Palestinians.
	   Palestinians: Say the offer falls far short of expectations.

German sentenced for putting poisoned jelly in supermarkets

<TEXT>
	   LUEBECK, Germany (AP) _ An architect facing heavy debts who
admitted to trying to extort millions from a jam company by putting
rat poison in jars of marmalade was sentenced Tuesday to five years
in prison.
	   Daniel Schuster, 48, of Ingolstadt, was convicted of attempted
extortion for demanding 1.5 million marks (dlrs 833,000) and dlrs
2.5 million from the Schwartauer Werke jam company in Luebeck.
	   Judge Horst Kaiser said Schuster was hoping to improve his
financial situation and snap himself out of a depression that began
when his company went bankrupt early last year.
	   The extortion attempt took place in mid-December, when three
jelly jars laced with rat poison were found on store shelves in
northern Germany. A warning _ ``Danger Poison'' _ was attached to
the inside of the lid on each. No one was injured.
	   Schuster was arrested Jan. 29 when he came to pick up the money.
	   The case was the latest in a series of similar crimes in
Germany, none of which have resulted in deaths or illnesses.

MCC members to vote _ again _ on admitting women
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Members of the Marylebone Cricket Club, the
male-only preserve of cricket's establishment at Lord's, will vote
again next month on a proposal to admit women members.
	   The 17,500 MCC members, whose average age is 57, voted in
February against a move to admit women to the club for the first
time in its 211-year history.
	   The only exception to the rule has been Queen Elizabeth II, who
is permitted to the hallowed Long Room as patron of the club.
	   At the time, Prime Minister Tony Blair condemned the vote to
continue banning women from the club, while Sports Minister Tony
Banks said the club would not receive any money allocated through
National Lottery to subsidize improvements at Lord's.
	   MCC committee president Colin Ingelby-Mackenzie said Tuesday
that a detailed proposal outlining the case for admitting women
would be circulated to members and another vote would be held on
Sept. 28.
	   Ingelby-Mackenzie, who supports the push to accept women, said a
comprehensive survey of members was being undertaken before the
vote to get a clear understanding of members' views.
	   ``Although some members are absolutely opposed to the concept of
women membership, irrespective of the detail, it seems that a
substantial number who voted against in February may well have done
so because of unfounded concerns about the impact of women
membership on the existing waiting list,'' he said.
	   Currently there is an 18-year waiting list for prospective
members.
	   The proposal needs a two-thirds majority to pass.
	   Members voted in February this year by 6,969 to 5,538 to admit
women. However, the motion failed because it fell 1,369 votes short
of the necessary majority.

WWF: 10 percent of tree species under extinction threat
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: World Wide Fund for Nature is known as World Wildlife Fund in
North America. &QL; 
 &UR; By GEIR MOULSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ One-tenth of the world's known species of trees
are in danger of extinction and fewer than one in four of those
benefit from protection efforts, the World Wide Fund for Nature and
other groups said in a study published Tuesday.
	   The 650-page ``World List of Threatened Trees'' resulted from a
three-year collaboration between the World Conservation Monitoring
Center, World Conservation Union and WWF, financed by the Dutch
government.
	   It reported that 8,753 of the world's estimated 80,000 to
100,000 tree species _ around 80 percent of which are found in the
tropics _ are either vulnerable or under critical threat.
	   Some 1,000 were classed as ``critically endangered,'' reduced to
tens of specimens.
	   ``It's scary, there's no other word for it,'' Jean-Paul
Jeanrenaud, head of WWF's forest program, told a news conference.
	   The report coincided with the start of a two-week meeting in
Geneva of a U.N. forum on forests, at which government delegations
will discuss measures to slow down deforestation.
	   Jeanrenaud called on governments to take responsibility for
better forest management and tree protection.
	   He pointed to a pledge by 22 countries, among them China and
Brazil, to protect a minimum 10 percent of their forests by the
year 2000, as one example of possible action.
	   Among the most threatened species listed in the report are three
of which only one specimen is known to remain, all due to loss of
their natural habitat.
	   A group of four Hibiscus clayi trees in Hawaii's Nounou
mountains appears to be the only remaining population of that
species, the study said. It cited invasive plants as one threat.
	   And grazing by introduced goats is thought to be responsible for
the reduction of another species, Scalesia atractyloides, to three
trees in a crater on Ecuador's Galapagos islands.
	   Illegal cutting of trees is at fault for the disappearance of
other species such as a rare whitebeam now reduced to around 30
trees in southwest England, the study said.
	   More than 1,000 species are threatened as a result of felling,
it claimed. Farming and expansion of human settlement were thought
to threaten some 900 and 750 species respectively, while grazing
and uncontrolled forest fires were cited as other major threats.
	   The organizations warned that species are being eliminated that
haven't yet been investigated scientifically. ``We don't know the
knock-on effect'' of that, Jeanrenaud warned.
	   ``Forest destruction is the key threat to species worldwide,''
said Mark Collins of the World Conservation Monitoring Center,
which compiled the report.
	   Dutch government delegate Tom van der Zon warned that
spectacular results shouldn't be expected from the U.N. forum, but
was hopeful it would help improve conservation efforts.

German government releases damning child poverty study
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government
presented an unfavorable report on child poverty Tuesday that the
opposition had accused it of trying to quash ahead of Sept. 27
elections.
	   The survey by a panel of independent experts said child poverty
is rising in Germany. It said 22 percent of children in the
formerly communist east and 12 percent in the west live in poverty.
	   But Family Minister Claudia Nolte rejected those conclusions,
saying the government disagreed with the report's definition of
poverty _ anyone who makes less than half the average German
income.
	   Panel members and opposition politicians last month accused the
government of sitting on the 700-page survey because it feared that
the criticism of poverty and the situation of young foreigners
would hurt Kohl's troubled re-election campaign.
	   Nolte blamed the delay in publication on the authors of the
study, saying they handed it in six months late in February. The
government needed time to draft its response, she said.
	   The number of children on welfare is increasing in Germany, but
the main reasons _ single-parent households and immigration _ can't
be directly influenced by the government, she told a news
conference.
	   One situation where poverty results is when people fail to claim
welfare benefits, she said.

Greeks told they no longer have to swear to God
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greeks may no longer have to swear to God
to get a government job, it was reported Tuesday.
	   But they won't be able to work in the some parts of the public
sector if their religious beliefs don't let them use weapons or
computers.
	   According to a decision issued Monday by Greece's highest
administrative court, the Council of State, people seeking a job in
the civil or military services may soon be offered an alternative
to the mandatory religious oath.
	   The court ruled that an ``oath of honor and conscience'' will be
accepted from applicants for positions in a new border guard unit.
	   The decision is expected to set a precedent for all public
sector jobs. A declaration of allegiance to the constitution and
country will remain compulsory.
	   It could also further bolster a growing debate for a
constitutional amendment to fully separate church from state.
	   Greece's Orthodox Church is recognized as the country's official
religion and strongly influences public life. More than 90 percent
of the country's 10.2 million people are baptized into the church.
	   The church has come under growing criticism for its interference
in politics and foreign policy. Among other things, it recently
opposed efforts to bring Greece in line with the rest of the
European Union by abolishing religious affiliation from state
issued identity cards.
	   The court also ruled that applicants will be banned from some
state jobs if their religious beliefs interfere with the ability to
perform their duties, such as refusal to take up arms or use a
computer.
	   It was the second such decision issued by the court this year. A
previous ruling upheld a complaint by a theology student who was
not given his degree because he refused to take a religious oath
mandated by his state university.

Chernomyrdin proposes coalition government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with three grafs with Chernomyrdin calling for
government of accord, TRIMS previous. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin
suggested Tuesday that the Communist-led opposition in the Russian
parliament could get seats in the new Cabinet.
	   Chernomyrdin, who huddled with his political supporters in
parliament on Tuesday, said the new Cabinet should be a so-called
government of accord. The statement signaled that President Boris
Yeltsin might overcome his disdain for his parliamentary foes and
reach a compromise with them in order to seal Chernomyrdin's
confirmation as prime minister.
	   In the past, Yeltsin has simply ignored Communists' calls for a
coalition government. Under the Russian law, parliament approves
the president's choice for premier but has no say over other
Cabinet appointments.
	   Yeltsin on Tuesday also finally took the nation out of its
two-day legal limbo, decreeing that the members of Prime Minister
Sergei Kiriyenko's Cabinet, which was ousted on Sunday, should stay
on the job until replacements are appointed.
	   The parliamentary vote to confirm Chernomyrdin is expected no
earlier than next week.
	   While asking other Cabinet members to stay, Yeltsin on Tuesday
accepted the resignation of former First Deputy Premier Boris
Nemtsov, once seen as a driving force behind economic reforms,
Russian news reports said. The resignation is expected to be
formally announced on Wednesday
	   In an interview published Tuesday, Chernomyrdin said he would
try to soften the impact of the country's financial crisis on
ordinary Russians and support ailing industries.
	   ``The protection of social interests will be our first
priority,'' he said in an interview with the daily Komsomolskaya
Pravda. ``The second will be state industrial policy, since we
can't take Russia out of crisis by purely monetary moves.''
	   Critics have said that it was Chernomyrdin's past policy of
unrealistic budgets and continuous support of inefficient
industries that precipitated the current crisis. However, his call
for more support to state industry will certainly win a sympathetic
ear from the Communists and other hardliners who dominate the Duma.
	   Yeltsin ousted Chernomyrdin in March and fought hard for his
successor, the young Kiriyenko, to be approved by the
Communist-dominated Duma. At the time, Yeltsin argued that the
country needed ``fresh ideas and unorthodox approaches'' to
overcome its stagnation.
	   However, the economy went into a nose dive shortly after
Kiriyenko's appointment and he spent his short term waging a losing
battle against the intermittent waves of financial crisis.
	   After the government finally surrendered last week, effectively
devaluing the ruble 34 percent despite repeated pledges to avoid
that step, Yeltsin applied his customary tactics of shifting the
blame and ousted Kiriyenko as suddenly as he had previously fired
Chernomyrdin.
	   ``Once he liked the young, now he likes heavyweights,'' Duma
speaker Gennady Seleznyov, a Communist, sneered at Yeltsin's Monday
explanation that Russia needed the ``heavyweight'' Chernomyrdin to
handle the crisis.
	   Chernomyrdin's nomination has failed to stop the ruble's steep
plunge. It fell 0.72 against the U.S. dollar on Tuesday on the
interbank currency exchange controlled by the Central Bank, closing
10 percent down at 7.86 rubles to the dollar.
	   Many Russian politicians and the media on Tuesday interpreted
the government shakeup as a sign that Yeltsin's health had
deteriorated to the point where he might step down any moment.
	   ``It has become quite clear that Russia lacks not only a
government, but a president as well,'' the business daily
Kommersant said in a front-page commentary.
	   The Kremlin insisted that Yeltsin's health was fine, but the
president, who has just returned from a month-long vacation, looked
tired and has had trouble following reporters' questions in his
recent public appearances.
	   Analysts said, however, that even though Yeltsin's position has
weakened, the president can't be expected to give up power.
	   ``The current economic crisis signals the end of Yeltsin's
era,'' said Vyacheslav Nikonov, a respected Russian political
analyst who heads the independent Politika think-tank.

Grenade explosion and crash kill at least 20 on bus to Kigali

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ A grenade exploded Tuesday on a bus bound
for Kigali, Rwanda, causing a collision and at least 20 deaths, a
Mbarara district spokeswoman said.
	   The spokeswoman, who identified herself only as Tumwine A., said
the exploding granade caused the bus to crash into a mini-van and
said at least 20 people had been killed.
	   It was not immediately clear how many died in the explosion and
how many were killed as a result of the crash.
	   Capital FM radio reported at least 30 were killed on the Kampala
to Kigali bus in the explosion that occurred on the main highway
between Masaka and Mbarara.
	   In Mbarara, 282 kilometers (175 miles) southwest of Kampala,
workers at Mbarara Hospital said the injured began arriving around
11 a.m. (0800 GMT). At least 10 were admitted for treatment,
several in surgery, according to the hospital superintendent, who
would not give his name.
	   He said it was possible the number of dead was greater than the
number of injured.
	   ``We have not yet assessed whether it was the impact of the
explosion or of the collision,'' that caused most of the injuries,
the superintendent said.
	   Since the beginning of the year, grenade attacks on bars and
restaurants in Kampala have killed at least six people and injured
more than a dozen.
	   The government has blamed most of the attacks on rebels
belonging to the Allied Democratic Forces who usually stage attacks
in western Uganda from bases inside the Democratic Republic of
Congo.
	   In Nov. 1997, police blamed a series of grenade attacks that
killed nine, including a prominent politician, on organized crime.

Floods maroon 500,000 people in north India

<TEXT>
	   LUCKNOW, India (AP) _ Battered by a series of landslides last
week, India's most populous state is now submerged under
floodwaters that have killed 600 people in a week and affected five
million others, officials said Tuesday.
	   The homes of at least 600,000 people in the northern Uttar
Pradesh state have been washed away, said Ashok Kumar, the state's
Relief Commissioner.
	   Provincial authorities issued a statewide alert after all the
major rivers in the state breached their embankments amid
torrential rains. The worst affected is the eastern part of the
state around Gorakhpur city, the historical region where the Buddha
once preached.
	   About 900 villages have been washed away and an estimated
500,000 people are still marooned in remote villages where rescue
teams are yet to reach, said officials at the Flood Control Cell in
Lucknow, the state capital.
	   The Army Tuesday began evacuating about 300,000 people stranded
on top of their flooded houses or living in makeshift structures or
relief camps in the eastern districts.
	   Standing crops across 1.5 million hectares (nearly 4 million
acres) of land in the region have been destroyed, said S.N. Shukla,
special secretary in the state's Relief Department.
	   ``All road links and telecommunication have been snapped,''
Shukla said. ``The airport and helipads are under floodwaters. The
only communication is through police and wireless sets.''
	   Relief Comissioner Ashok Kumar estimated that the floods had
destroyed crops and homes valued at 10 billion rupees (dlrs 240
million).
	   Lucknow, the provincial capital, is itself threatened. Officials
Tuesday warned 200,000 residents living along the Gomti River that
they could be asked to evacuate their homes at short notice.
	   At risk is the Taj Hotel, a plush five-star property owned by
the Tata Group, India's leading business conglomerate.
	   Uttar Pradesh is crisscrossed by some of India's major rivers
which meander toward the sea after making their way down the
Himalayas in India's north. Many are flooded during the monsoon
season.
	   Torrential rains caused more a dozen major landslides that
rocked the Himalayan region in the state through last week, burying
villages and mowing down roads and communication links. At least
239 people were feared killed.

Taiwan indicts 11 for sailing directly to China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Eleven Taiwanese who defied an official
ban by sailing directly to China were indicted by prosecutors on
the island of Kinmen Tuesday, the official Central News Agency
reported.
	   Prosecutor Lin Shao-fang said she will ask for particularly
harsh sentences for the three elected officials _ county counselor
Kin Chieh-shou, National Assemblyman Tsao Yuan-chang, and city
counselor Huang Hsi-ling _ for having ``knowingly violated the law
and leading the illegal expedition,'' the report said.
	   Also indicted were the owners of the Hawaii 3 fishing boat that
made the voyage, four other campaigners for Taiwan's reunification
with China and two accompanying TV reporters.
	   Under Taiwanese law, they could be fined up to 15 million Taiwan
dollars (U.S. dlrs 4288,000) and sentenced to prison terms of up to
three years.
	   The group sailed for China from northern Taiwan on Aug. 18,
arguing that the ban on direct links is expensive and inconvenient
for ordinary Taiwanese and intended to prolong the political
separation between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.
	   The group was first arrested after arriving at Kinmen on Aug.
20.
	   Kinmen's Chief Prosecutor was quoted by CNA as saying that no
excuses would be accepted.
	   ``Politics is politics and the law is the law,'' it quoted Lin
Ling-yu as saying.
	   Tsao claimed the group favored lifting the ban on links between
the Taiwanese-controlled Kinmen, also known as Quemoy, and Matsu
island groups and the Chinese mainland as a first step to
comprehensive links.
	   Residents of those islands must now fly to Taiwan and then
transit through Hong Kong or another territory before flying to
points on the opposite coast visible from Kinmen and Matsu. Many
opt to shortcut through the thriving though illicit navigation that
has sprung up between the sides.
	   Kin and the other activists are members of the minor opposition
New Party, which draws much of its support from Chinese immigrants
who fled to Taiwan with Chiang Kai-shek's defeated Nationalists in
1949.
	   Since that year, Taiwan has banned direct shipping, commerce and
communications with China, intended originally to isolate the
communists but now more valued as a bargaining chip for use in
future negotiations with Beijing.
	   Taiwan's government has come under increasing pressure at home
to restore direct links as marriage, trade and investment ties
grow.

Muslim clerics close mosque after arrest of Palestinian
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - Muslim clerics closed Islam's third holiest
shrine to tourists for several hours in protest Tuesday after
Israeli border police arrested two Palestinians in the mosque
compound.
	   The Al Aqsa Mosque compound, like other Islamic sites in
Jerusalem, enjoys a great deal of autonomy and Israeli authorities
are only permitted to enter under certain circumstances.
	   The incident began when two border policemen stopped two
brothers, Mohammed and Shadi Hidadit, for an identity check in the
walled Old City.
	   A scuffle ensued and the brothers ran away and sought refuge in
the nearby Al Aqsa compound. They were pursued by the policemen who
followed them into the compound to arrest them. Three mosque guards
intervened and scuffled with the border policemen, Zurda said.
	   The Islamic Trust, or Waqf, which administers the compound,
closed Al Aqsa to tourists for several hours as Waqf director Adnan
Husseini met with Jerusalem's police commander, Yair Yitzhaki.
	   Husseini said the Waqf would not accept the presence of border
policemen in the compound, which is known to Jews as the Temple
Mount, the site of the ancient Jewish Temple.
	   In a related development, the Israeli daily Maariv said Tuesday
that Israeli authorities have beefed up security near the Al Asqa
compound because of growing concern it could be targeted by Jewish
extremists.

Israelis, Palestinians continue talks to revive peace process
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG MELLGREN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ With a renewed sense of optimism, Israeli
and Palestinian negotiators on Tuesday resumed their drive to
revive the Middle East peace process that has been stalled for the
past 18 months.
	   The delegations came to the Norwegian capital for Monday
ceremonies marking the fifth anniversary of the Oslo Accords that
started the peace process. The groups talked past midnight, then
resumed later on Tuesday morning.
	   Palestinian President Yasser Arafat was among those involved in
the talks, but left Oslo for Egypt and then the Gaza, in keeping
with his original schedule.
	   ``I believe we will come to points that could really make a
breakthrough in the process. When I go back to Israel, of course, I
am going to report to Prime Minister (Benjamin) Netanyahu,'' said
Meir Sheetrit, a top member of the ruling Likud coaltion.
	   U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross refused to discuss details of the
negotiations.
	   ``I think that we have had useful talks. We are still working to
try to find ways to overcome the differences. And there are still
remaining difficulties,'' said Ross at a midday break.
	   In January, the United States proposed that Israel withdraw from
13 percent of the West Bank, in exchange for Palestinian security
gestures. The Palestinians accepted the proposal but Israel did not
and the sides have been haggling since.
	   On Monday, Arafat said new Israeli ideas submitted in recent
days were ``a beginning'' and that he would accept an Israeli
formula to turn part of the land slated for withdrawal into a
nature reserve where Palestinians would not be allowed to settle.
However, the Palestinians want clarification about the extent of
control they would have over the nature reserve.
	   ``What we are trying to do is see if there is a possibility of
reaching an agreement,'' said the top Palestinian representative,
Ahmed Qureia, also known as Abu Ala.
	   The 1993 peace accord brokered by a small Norwegian team during
months of secret talks in Oslo formed the basis of the peace
process. But the process has been bogged down since the right-wing
government of Benjamin Netanyahu took power from the Labor Party in
May 1996.
	   Terje Roed-Larsen, one of the Norwegians credited with starting
the secret Oslo talks, was also involved in the current
discussions.
	   ``It is very clear that the marking of the fifth anniversary has
given a good starting point for the talks that have taken place,''
Roed-Larsen said.
	   He refused to discuss specifics of the negotiations and said no
announcements would be made Tuesday.
	   But he said the negotaions were focusing on the definition of
some of the land that could be turned over to the Palestinians;
matters of security, and a possible third phase of Israeli
withdrawal from occupied territories.
	   Sheetrit, the Likud coalition's leader in Israel's Knesset, said
he was more optimistic now than when he arrived in Oslo, partly
because the talks were face-to-face.
	   ``We are close, I believe, to a closure,'' he said.
	   He said he believed the main disagreements over how much area
the Israelis would withdraw from had been clarified, and that what
remained was what he called ``reciprocity'' by the Palestinians.
That is generally seen as an Israeli demand for Palestinian
promised to quell terror attacks.
	   The Oslo Accords were finalized in the Norwegian capital on the
night of Aug. 19-20, 1993. Among those who attended the Sunday and
Monday ceremony was former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres, who
shared the 1994 Nobel Peace Prized in Oslo with Arafat and then
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzahk Rabin. Rabin was murdered the next
year by an opponent of the peace process.

Retired Greek American newspaper publisher dies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with full name of newspaper, tightens &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Solon G. Vlasto, publisher of what was
once the largest Greek newspaper in the United States, has died. He
was 94.
	   Vlasto, who published the Greek-language daily The Atlantis in
New York, died Monday in an Athens retirement home 25 years after
returning to his native land, local media reported Tuesday.
	   Vlasto moved to the United States in 1918 and went to work at
The Atlantis, which was owned by his uncle, Solon J. Vlasto. It was
founded in 1894.
	   Starting as a copy boy, Vlasto worked his way through the ranks
and took over as publisher in 1944. The newspaper was willed to him
by his uncle. It once had a peak circulation of 22,000 in the
1950's, but foundered and shut down in 1973.
	   New York is still home to the two largest Greek-language dailies
published in the United States, the National Herald and Proini.
	   Vlasto retired to his parents' home in the northern Athens
suburb of Kifissia in 1973.
	   He is survived by his sons, James Vlasto of New York City and
George Vlasto of Kent, Connecticut.
	   Funeral arrangements were not known.

Pakistan indicates support for nuclear test ban at U.S. talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ U.S. and Pakistani officials held a fourth round
of talks Tuesday on nuclear nonproliferation, and Islamabad
indicated its support for a ban on nuclear testing and the transfer
of nuclear technology.
	   Since India and Pakistan conducted underground nuclear tests in
May, the United States has been trying to prevent a nuclear arms
race in South Asia.
	   In a statement before the start of talks with U.S. Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, Pakistan's Foreign Secretary
Shamshad Ahmed expressed hope for ``positive and fruitful''
discussions that would build on progress during previous meetings.
	   U.S. Embassy spokesman Rod Francis said Talbott would make no
statement, except to confirm that ``South Asia nuclear issues''
were being discussed.
	   The talks are being held at a secret location in London.
	   Ahmed said Pakistan supports nonproliferation but will not give
up its newly acquired nuclear capabality _ ``its credible
deterrence capability.''
	   The Americans have been pushing for Pakistan and India to sign
the nuclear test ban treaty as a first step toward reducing
tensions.
	   Ahmed noted that Pakistan had supported the Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty at the United Nations.
	   ``We have already declared a moratorium on testing subject to
the maintenance of status quo in the region. We have also publicly
stated that nuclear technology would not be transferred to any
third party or entity. Thus, we have a consistently positive
attitude to nonproliferation,'' he said.
	   But Pakistan has said previously it won't sign a test ban treaty
that would give an advantage to rival India.
	   During previous talks, Pakistan pressed for world involvement in
settling the volatile Kashmir dispute that has been the cause of
two wars between Pakistan and India. The two neighbors fought a
third war over Bangladesh or what was then East Pakistan.
	   India has rejected international mediation in the Kashmir
dispute. Both countries lay claim to a united Kashmir, divided
between Pakistan and India by the departing British in 1947.
	   ``The core issue is the Jammu and Kashmir dispute which deserves
continued engagement of the international community,'' Ahmed
reiterated in the statement.
	   He stressed that peace and economic security are Pakistan's
primary concerns in the talks.
	   Pakistan's fragile economy, which depends more heavily than
India's on international loans, has suffered from economic
sanctions the United States imposed on both countries after their
nuclear tests.
	   ``Continuation of coercive sanctions will not help; these have
always proved to be counterproductive,'' he said.
	   Ahmed said he would also use the meeting with Talbott to discuss
last week's U.S. cruise missile strikes against alleged terrorist
training camps in Afghanistan.
	   The United States attacked Afghanistan and a plant in Sudan in
retaliation for the bombings of the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania in which 257 people died and over 5,500 were injured.
	   Pakistan has condemned the U.S. attacks, but its criticism has
been fairly muted.

German government releases damning child poverty study
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with opposition reaction. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government
presented an unfavorable report on child poverty Tuesday that the
opposition had accused it of trying to quash ahead of Sept. 27
elections.
	   The survey by a panel of independent experts said child poverty
is rising in Germany. It said 22 percent of children in the
formerly communist east and 12 percent in the west live in poverty.
	   But Family Minister Claudia Nolte rejected those conclusions,
saying the government disagreed with the report's definition of
poverty _ anyone who makes less than half the average German
income.
	   Panel members and opposition politicians last month accused the
government of sitting on the 700-page survey because it feared that
the criticism of poverty and the situation of young foreigners
would hurt Kohl's troubled re-election campaign.
	   Nolte blamed the delay in publication on the authors of the
study, saying they handed it in six months late in February. The
government needed time to draft its response, she said.
	   The number of children on welfare is increasing in Germany, but
the main reasons _ single-parent households and immigration _ can't
be directly influenced by the government, she told a news
conference.
	   One situation where poverty results is when people fail to claim
welfare benefits, she said.
	   The opposition Social Democrats accused Nolte of ``hiding behind
definition questions.''
	   ``Now we know why the report on children and youth was to have
been delayed: Nolte still insists on closing her eyes to the
conclusions,'' lawmaker Edith Niehuis said.

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO (AP) _ The Egyptian government is to privatize 13
companies with a combined market value of 1.5 billion Egyptian
pounds (dlrs 441 million) in September, Public Enterprises Minister
Atef Ebeid said in remarks published Tuesday.
	   Ebeid said the group includes six industrial companies which
will be sold to strategic investors and seven milling and maritime
companies which will be sold to their employee-shareholder
associations, the newspaper Al-Ahram reported.
	   Al-Ahram said the companies to be sold to strategic investors
are Beni Suef Cement, Abu Zaabal Fertilizers, Misr Glass &AMP; Crystal,
Delta Sand Bricks, Engineering Enterprises for Steel Work Co. and
the Egyptian Co. for Metallic Construction.
	   The companies to be sold to their employee-shareholder
associations are Behira Rice Mills, Dakahlia Rice Mills Co.,
Egyptian Marine Supply &AMP; Contracting Co., Egyptian Co. for Maritime
Transport, Amoun Navigation Agencies, Memphis Navigation Agencies
and Abu Simbel &AMP; Tiba Agencies &AMP; Maritime Services.
	   A Cabinet committee decided last week that Egypt would sell off
60 state-owned companies in the fiscal year ending June 30, 1999,
in addition to divesting the remaining government stakes in eight
partially-privatized companies and seven joint-venture companies.
	   Egypt's privatization program has speeded up since 1996, when
Kamal El-Ganzouri was appointed prime minister. The government has
sold nearly a third of the 300-odd companies on its privatization
list.
	   ____
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The Kuwait Ports Authority has made some 6 million
dinars (dlrs 19.60 million) in net profits in fiscal 1997-98, its
highest in ten years, the Kuwait News Agency reported Tuesday.
	   KPU's financial manager, Abdullah al-Shimali, told the agency
the authority made 58,000 dinars (dlrs 190,000) in net profits in
the previous fiscal. Kuwait's fiscal year starts July 1.
	   He put the increase down to higher revenues and said the
authority managed to cut expenses by laying off 970 foreign
workers. It also increased its efficiency by computerizing its
operations, changing its handling system and renting out some of
its storage facilities.
	   Al-Shimali expected gains to be even higher this year, when the
country's first free-trade zone opens in Shuwaikh Port, just west
of Kuwait City.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Miller Beer is to be brewed and sold in
Jordan from next month, the chairman of the Middle East
International Investment Group said Tuesday.
	   Youssef Amayirah told the Associated Press that his company,
which is owned by Jordanian shareholders, will be marketing the
beer under license from Miller Brewing Company of Milwaukee, U.S.
	   A brewery has been built 60 kilometers (36 miles) south-east of
Amman at a cost of dlrs 30 million, Amayirah said. It will employ
150 workers.
	   Production trials are due to begin next week and the beer should
be on supermarket shelves in September, he said. It will be the
first time that American beer is sold in Jordan.
	   The company plans to market the beer across the Middle East.
	   Miller Brewing has provided technical assistance to the plant,
said Amayirah.
	   ____
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The Jordan Financing and Investment Bank
earned a profit of 1 million dinars (dlrs 1.4 million) during the
first six months of this year, a drop of 31 percent from the same
period last year, the bank said in a statement Tuesday.
	   The fall in profit was due to the economic recession and the
political uncertainty in the Middle East, the statement said.
	   The statement said the bank's total assets increased by 5.3
percent to 265 million dinars (dlrs 373 million) and deposits rose
by 4.6 percent to 208 million dinars (dlrs 292.6 million) during
the first six months of 1998.

Magistrate dismisses defense request to release suspect
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in 5th graf with defense saying they will renew the
application.
 &UR; By GEORGE MWANGI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ A magistrate on Tuesday dismissed an
application from the defense to release from jail a senior game
warden arrested more than a month ago in connection with the 1988
murder of British tourist Julie Ward.
	   Magistrate Uniter Kidullah adjourned the court until Sept. 1
when another hearing was expected.
	   She said Simon ole Makallah had not been formally charged by the
court and therefore, the court had no power to discharge him or
dismiss the charges. She said only the High Court had that power.
	   Kidullah has granted several prosecution requests for more time
to put a case together before formal charges are filed and Makallah
is called to enter a plea.
	   Defense attorney Karieko Tobiko said he will renew the
application to dismiss charges and have his client released.
	   Makallah, a senior warden in the Kenya Wildlife Service, was
arrested July 17. The following day, Attorney General Amos Wako,
flanked by Ward's father, John, said there was sufficient
circumstantial evidence to arraign the suspect and hold a second
trial in the murder of the 28-year-old Ward, whose burned corpse
was found in the Maasai Mara National Reserve in September 1988.
	   Makallah has not yet been required to enter a plea although he
has been held in jail for a month.
	   Ward's mutilated and charred remains were discovered in the
reserve on the Tanzanian border Sept. 13, 1988. Officials first
claimed she had been attacked and killed by wild animals.

Investors await government decision on debt restructuring
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with three banks planning merger to stave off
crisis, Shokhin favoring softer terms of debt restructuring. &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Russia-Politics &QL; 
 &UR; By JUDITH INGRAM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin approved
a plan to restructure dlrs 40 billion in short-term debt, including
more than dlrs 11 billion in bonds held by foreign investors, while
the national currency plunged Tuesday in the worst fall in almost
four years.
	   The terms of the restructuring were to be announced later in the
day, more than a week after the government announced that the
country's severe economic crisis would force the move, said Vadim
Birkin, spokesman for acting Deputy Prime Minister Boris Fyodorov.
	   The announcement has already been postponed twice, after foreign
investors protested that the restructuring would favor Russian
commercial banks.
	   The delay reflected Russia's political limbo following President
Boris Yeltsin's dismissal of Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko on
Sunday. On his first day in office, Chernomyrdin on Monday asked
the State Duma, the lower house of parliament, to set aside ``for
the time being'' a set of economic austerity measures that had been
demanded by international lenders and formulated by Kiriyenko's
team.
	   The ruble fell 10 percent in trading Tuesday, closing at 7.86 to
the dollar, down from 7.14 on Monday. Trading volume amounted to
dlrs 430 million.
	   It was the biggest plunge since October 1994, and it signaled
continuing chaos on Russia's financial markets.
	   The Central Bank has been selling dollars steadily in recent
sessions in an effort to slow the fall of the Russian currency. By
midday on Tuesday alone, it had already spent about dlrs 340
million to defend the ruble, traders said. Trading was suspended
twice on the interbank currency exchange when the bank was
overwhelmed by demand for dollars.
	   Three of the nation's leading banks _ Oneximbank, Bank Menatep
and Most Bank _ announced a merger on Tuesday. The merger is an
apparent attempt to prevent an acute liquidity crisis by uniting
their resources.
	   Most Russian banks have found themselves in a difficult position
after last week's devaluation of the ruble because of
overdependence on their ruble assets. More merger announcements are
expected.
	   Each of the banks will transfer 51 percent of its shares into a
new holding, which will coordinate the operations of the banks in
the merger process, and the merger will be completed by Jan. 1, a
statement from Oneximbank said.
	   Stocks rose in thin trading, despite a steady absence of foreign
investors who were worried over the state debt restructuring plan.
	   The market activity was driven mostly by local investors,
speculating on quick moves in the stock prices after most Russian
blue chips plummeted amid recent financial turmoil.
	   At 2 p.m. (1000 GMT), the Russian Trading System index climbed
to 88.42 points, up 2.3 percent from Monday's close at 86.40
points.
	   Chernomyrdin was going over final details of the debt
restructuring plan on Tuesday afternoon, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported. It said that the government would offer several options,
and that foreigners and domestic investors would be treated
equally.
	   Alexander Pochinok, chief of the government's department of
finances and credit regulations, said it would take about a month
to complete the restructuring of dlrs 40 billion worth of
outstanding bond issues, which officials had originally promised to
announce last week.
	   He said the plan still needs Yeltsin's approval, and that
details would be published only after Yeltsin issued a presidential
decree.
	   The Russian government defaulted on its treasury debt last week,
and announced that it would force investors to swap their paper for
new, presumably longer-term, obligations.
	   Investors are now expecting the government to offer them the
option of swapping into long-term dollar denominated paper with a
very modest return, or much higher-yielding paper denominated in
rubles.
	   Investors say a third option might allow them to keep their
existing treasuries to maturity, after which they would be given
new two-year ruble-denominated securities.

Cambodian officials seek to end protest against election fraud

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Keeping up pressure on Cambodian
leader Hun Sen, 5,000 people demonstrated Tuesday in front of the
National Assembly and cheered calls for his ouster by opposition
leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh.
	   It was the third protest against Cambodia's strongman in as many
days, and officials in his government called it ``illegal'' and
unauthorized.
	   Crowds blocked roads and crammed inside a park in front of the
assembly, where 100 people spent Monday night in a vigil to protest
alleged fraud in last month's parliamentary elections.
	   Their numbers rose and fell Tuesday, with some drifting off as
heavy rains pelted the park and others ducking for cover under
makeshift tents or trees.
	   ``This is an outlawed demonstration,'' said Khieu Sopheak, an
Interior Ministry spokesman. ``But since it is illegal, if
something happens, how can the competent authorities be
responsible?''
	   Interior Minister Sar Kheng met with Lakhan Mehrotra, the U.N.
special representative to Cambodia, to try to find a way out of the
round-the-clock vigil, which has raised fears of new violence.
	   Sam Rainsy, an opposition leader, also met ministry officials.
	   The park was the site of a grenade attack against a protest led
by Sam Rainsy in March 1997. Sixteen people died and more than 100
were wounded in the attack, which Sam Rainsy blamed on Hun Sen.
	   Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party won 64 of the 122 seats in
the National Assembly in the July 26 poll, short of the two-thirds
majority needed to form a government.
	   Opposition parties have accused the CPP of perpetrating
widespread fraud in the balloting and counting process and have
said they will boycott any attempts by Hun Sen to form a ruling
coalition.
	   The crowd cheered Tuesday when Ranariddh, president of the
leading opposition FUNCINPEC party, arrived to greet them for the
first time. He returned Monday from Bangkok, where he had spent the
last 10 days.
	   ``Hun Sen said he is (a man) of the people,'' Ranariddh shouted
toward the sea of faces from the top of a pickup truck. ``He should
listen to the people and step down.''
	   Hun Sen ousted Ranariddh as his co-premier in a violent coup in
July 1997. As many as 100 of his loyalists were killed in the
months that followed.
	   Hun Sen called for new elections to win back legitimacy and the
international aid lost after his violent takeover.
	   The prince warned Tuesday that Hun Sen's time in power is
running out.
	   The mandate of the current National Assembly expires Sept. 24,
he said, proposing that his father, King Norodom Sihanouk,
intervene and form a caretaker government until a new election can
be held.
	   ``On July 26, the people did not vote for Hun Sen but for
democrats,'' the prince shouted to the crowd, wiping sweat from his
forehead. ``We are not going anywhere. We will stay here to demand
justice.''
	   More than dlrs 3,000 in donations have been collected from
supporters, market vendors, students and drivers of three-wheeled
vehicles called pedicabs to keep the vigil going.
	   Sam Rainsy, whose party finished third in the elections, said if
there are any efforts by police to forcibly remove protesters they
will peacefully resist by lying limply on the ground.

 &UR; Nigeria to hold presidential vote Feb. 27, 1999 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria will hold presidential elections
on Feb. 27, 1999, in line with promises from the military
government to hand over power to civilians next May, the electoral
commission announced Tuesday.
	   Elections for the national assembly in Africa's most populous
country will be held one week earlier, on Feb. 20, the commission
said in a statement.
	   Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, who came to power in early June after
the sudden death of the former dictator, Gen. Sani Abacha, said
last month that Nigeria would hold presidential elections in the
first quarter of 1999, and turn power over to a civilian government
in May.

	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Nigeria's new military leader on
Tuesday reaffirmed his commitment to handing over power to an
elected civilian government by May 29, 1999.
	   Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar told parliament that military rule was
no longer acceptable in his country.
	   ``We have now unequivocally chosen democracy as our preferred
option of governance,'' he said. ``Nigerians want nothing less than
true democracy in a united and peaceful country.''
	   Abubakar addressed lawmakers during a first state visit to South
Africa by a Nigerian leader.
	   Abubakar's predecessor, Gen. Sani Abacha, died of a heart attack
in June, ending five years of brutal rule and defiance of world
condemnation for usurping democratic elections.
	   Abubakar has pledged to return the country to civilian rule in
May next year and has promised elections in first quarter of the
year.

U.N. human rights chief plans trip to China next month
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary
Robinson, plans a potentially controversial trip to China in
September, her spokesman said Tuesday.
	   During the trip from September 7-15, Robinson aims to focus on
the country's rural poverty, the situation of women and labor
issues, said spokesman Jose Diaz.
	   Robinson, the former Irish president, also wants to visit Tibet
to meet with ``a wide spectrum of personalities,'' Diaz said. He
didn't say whether this would include the country's exiled leader,
the Dalai Lama. The Chinese seized Tibet in 1950 and have ruled it
as a province of China ever since.
	   Diaz said the Chinese authorities hadn't yet given the go-ahead
for Robinson's visit, but said ``we have been told it has been
considered positively.'' He said further details of the trip had
yet to be finalized.
	   Earlier this year, human rights groups criticized the 53-nation
U.N. Human Rights Commission over its failure to adopt a resolution
condemning China's human rights record.
	   The United States and European Union countries broke with
previous years' motions criticizing China, preferring dialogue with
the country.
	   Diaz said Robinson also hoped to hold talks with the Chinese on
their possible ratification of key U.N. human rights accords
including the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the
Convention on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.

Pilots' resignations force Taiwan carrier to cancel flights
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan's TransAsia Airways grounded its
fleet of ATR turboprops Tuesday following the mass resignation of
pilots, snarling traffic and heating the tempers of hundreds of
commuters.
	   Sixty-seven pilots walked off the job Monday night after the
company announced it would reduce their salaries by up to 30
percent amid a slump in the overcrowded industry. The resignations
left the airline with just five pilots flying the French-Italian
ATR42 and ATR72 passenger planes.
	   Nine routes, mostly short hops to Taiwan's east coast or
outlying islands, were canceled Tuesday.
	   The airline said it hopes to have the planes flying again by
Friday and the government's Civil Aeronautics Administration urged
the sides to hold talks. Pilots said they have yet to be given any
incentive to return.
	   Passenger levels dipped badly following a pair of fatal air
crashes and other aviation mishaps earlier this year. Few of
Taiwan's 15 airlines are considered to be profitable, leading to a
government push for consolidation in the industry.
	   Primarily a domestic carrier, TransAsia employs about 245 pilots
to fly 48 planes of all types.

Netanyahu promises to expand Jewish settlements in Hebron
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CHANGES wording in 11th graf to CLARIFY that while
Palestinians do not object to having existing nature reserves
included in the pullback, they don't want Israel to give nature
reserve status to land for the purpose of a pullback &QL; 
 &UR; By NASSER SHIYOUKHI &QC;

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank, (AP) - Even as a peace deal with the
Palestinians appeared closer at hand, Prime Minister Benjamin on
Tuesday paid a surprise visit to Jewish settlers in this tense
Palestinian town and promised to expand their community.
	   Netanyahu's gesture was aimed at his hardline critics, including
many settler leaders, who have demanded that Israel break off
negotiations with the Palestinians following the killing of a
well-known Hebron rabbi, apparently by a Palestinian, last week.
	   Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat reportedly have
softened their positions on an Israeli troop withdrawal in the West
Bank after a 17-month stalemate, though both sides said Tuesday
that several issues remained unresolved.
	   The progress made in recent days apparently was not sufficient
to persuade U.S. Mideast peace envoy Dennis Ross to return to the
region to try and finalize a deal.
	   In an unannounced condolence visit to Hebron on Tuesday,
Netanyahu said he would build new homes for the 450 Jews living in
the divided city of 130,000 Palestinians.
	   ``I care. I want them (settlers) to have security and permanency
and expansion and they deserve it,'' Netanyahu said.
	   He said proposals to build permanent housing in the Jewish
enclave of Tel Romeida, a small trailer park where the rabbi was
killed last week, were submitted for approval Tuesday.
	   Netanyahu also approved the construction of an apartment
building for settlers next to the enclave of Beit Hadassah, the
Yediot Ahronot daily said. Land next to Beit Hadassah was recently
cleared for construction.
	   Finance Minister Yaakov Neeman, meanwhile, has set aside 10
million shekels (drls 2.7 million) for Tel Romeida construction,
and on Monday parliament's Finance Ministry approved an additional
90 million shekels (dlrs 24.2 million) for settlement expansion
throughout the West Bank.
	   The United States offered a proposal in January for an Israeli
withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank, in exchange for
Palestinian security gestures. The Palestinians accepted the
proposal but Israel did not and the sides have been haggling since.
	   On Monday, Arafat said new Israeli ideas submitted in recent
days were ``a beginning'' and that he would accept an Israeli
formula under which some of the land slated for withdrawal would be
nature reserves where Palestinians would not be allowed to settle.
	   However, Palestinian Information Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo said
Tuesday the Palestinians would not agree to Israel declaring some
areas ``nature reserves'' only for the purpose of a pullback.
	   Abed Rabbo also said the Palestinians sought clarifications
about the extent of control the Palestinians would have over the
nature reserve.

Israelis, Palestinians continue talks to revive peace process

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ With a renewed sense of optimism, Israeli
and Palestinian negotiators on Tuesday resumed their drive to
revive the Middle East peace process that has been stalled for the
past 18 months.
	   The delegations came to the Norwegian capital for Monday
ceremonies marking the fifth anniversary of the Oslo Accords that
started the peace process. The groups talked past midnight, then
resumed meeting later Tuesday morning.
	   Palestinian President Yasser Arafat was among those involved in
the talks, but left Oslo for Egypt and then Gaza, in keeping with
his original schedule.
	   ``I believe we will come to points that could really make a
breakthrough in the process. When I go back to Israel, of course, I
am going to report to Prime Minister (Benjamin) Netanyahu,'' said
Meir Sheetrit, a top member of the ruling Likud coalition.
	   U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross refused to discuss details of the
negotiations.
	   ``I think that we have had useful talks. We are still working to
try to find ways to overcome the differences. And there are still
remaining difficulties,'' said Ross at a midday break.
	   In January, the United States proposed that Israel withdraw from
13 percent of the West Bank, in exchange for Palestinian security
gestures. The Palestinians accepted the proposal but Israel did not
and the sides have been haggling since.
	   On Monday, Arafat said new Israeli ideas submitted in recent
days were ``a beginning'' and that he would accept an Israeli
formula to turn part of the land slated for withdrawal into a
nature reserve where Palestinians would not be allowed to settle.
However, the Palestinians want clarification about the extent of
control they would have over the nature reserve.
	   ``What we are trying to do is see if there is a possibility of
reaching an agreement,'' said the top Palestinian representative,
Ahmed Qureia, also known as Abu Ala.
	   The 1993 peace accord brokered by a small Norwegian team during
months of secret talks in Oslo formed the basis of the peace
process. But the process has been bogged down since the right-wing
government of Benjamin Netanyahu took power from the Labor Party in
May 1996.
	   Terje Roed-Larsen, one of the Norwegians credited with starting
the secret Oslo talks, was also involved in the current
discussions.
	   ``It is very clear that the marking of the fifth anniversary has
given a good starting point for the talks that have taken place,''
Roed-Larsen said.
	   He refused to discuss specifics of the negotiations and said no
announcements would be made Tuesday.
	   But he said the negotiations were focusing on the definition of
some of the land that could be turned over to the Palestinians;
matters of security, and a possible third phase of Israeli
withdrawal from occupied territories.
	   Sheetrit, the Likud coalition's leader in Israel's Knesset, said
he was more optimistic now than when he arrived in Oslo, partly
because the talks were face-to-face.
	   ``We are close, I believe, to a closure,'' he said.
	   He said he believed the main disagreements over how much area
the Israelis would withdraw from had been clarified, and that what
remained was what he called ``reciprocity'' by the Palestinians.
That is generally seen as an Israeli demand for Palestinian
promised to quell terror attacks.
	   The Oslo Accords were finalized in the Norwegian capital on the
night of Aug. 19-20, 1993. Among those who attended the Sunday and
Monday ceremony was former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres, who
shared the 1994 Nobel Peace Prized in Oslo with Arafat and then
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. Rabin was murdered the next
year by an opponent of the peace process.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin
suggested Tuesday that the Communist-led opposition in the Russian
parliament could get seats in his new Cabinet.
	   Chernomyrdin, who huddled with his political supporters in
parliament on Tuesday, said the new Cabinet should be a so-called
``government of accord.'' The statement signaled that President
Boris Yeltsin might overcome his disdain for his parliamentary foes
and reach a compromise with them in order to seal Chernomyrdin's
confirmation as prime minister.
	   The Communists who lead the parliament have long called for such
a coalition government that would prominently feature their members
and allies. From time to time, Yeltsin has appointed a few
Communists to top jobs but has turned down calls for a broader
coalition.
	   Under Russian law, parliament approves the president's choice
for premier but has no say over other Cabinet appointments.

Empty homes in Jewish settlements in West Bank, Gaza Strip
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A quarter of the homes built by the Israeli
government in Jewish settlements in the West Bank and the Gaza
Strip between 1989 and 1992 still stand empty, according to a
Housing Ministry document obtained Tuesday.
	   The figures appear to undermine claims by Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu that more construction in Jewish settlements is
necessary to accommodate population growth.
	   The Palestinians, who want to establish a state in the West Bank
and Gaza, say settlement construction is part of a land grab. The
United States has long demanded that Israel freeze settlement
expansion to improve the negotiating climate with the Palestinians.
	   According to a Housing Ministry survey obtained Tuesday by The
Associated Press, the hard-line Likud government of Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir built 3,905 homes in the West Bank and Gaza with
public funds between 1989-92.
	   Fifty-five percent, or 2,126, were never sold. Of those still on
the market, 519 have been rented and 613 have been occupied by
squatters or are being used by settlements as offices.
	   Another 994 homes, or 25.5 percent, remain empty.
	   The Housing Ministry recommends a more aggressive marketing
campaign to sell the homes. The ministry is also considering ways
to make squatters the legal residents of those homes they have
illegally seized, the Maariv newspaper said.
	   Netanyahu's senior aide, David Bar-Illan, said that while in
outlying settlements some homes are empty, in many other
communities there was a waiting list for people trying to move in.
	   Earlier this week, the government allocated another dlrs 24.2
million for settlement construction.
	   In addition, dlrs 2.7 million were set aside for building
permanent homes in Tel Romeida, a trailer park in one of the Jewish
enclaves of the Palestinian town of Hebron. The money was allotted
after a prominent rabbi was stabbed to death in Tel Romeida last
week, allegedly by a Palestinian.

U.N. human rights chief plans trip to China next month
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary
Robinson, plans a potentially controversial trip to China in
September, her spokesman said Tuesday.
	   During the trip, Robinson aims to focus on the country's rural
poverty, the situation of women and labor issues, said spokesman
Jose Diaz.
	   Robinson, the former Irish president, also wants to visit Tibet
to meet with ``a wide spectrum of personalities,'' Diaz said. He
didn't say whether this would include the country's exiled leader,
the Dalai Lama. The Chinese seized Tibet in 1950 and have ruled it
as a province of China ever since.
	   Diaz said the Chinese authorities hadn't yet given the go-ahead
for Robinson's visit, but said ``we have been told it has been
considered positively.'' He said further details of the trip,
scheduled for September 7-15, had yet to be finalized.
	   Earlier this year, human rights groups criticized the 53-nation
U.N. Human Rights Commission over its failure to adopt a resolution
condemning China's human rights record.
	   The United States and European Union countries broke with
previous years' motions criticizing China, preferring dialogue with
the country.
	   Diaz said Robinson also hoped to hold talks with the Chinese on
their possible ratification of key U.N. human rights accords
including the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the
Convention on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.

Search for Amber Room halted
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KLAIPEDA, Lithuania (AP) _ German treasure-hunters hoping to
find the Czarist Amber Room treasure in a Lithuanian lagoon have
halted their search due to equipment problems, but intend to come
back.
	   ``The secret remains unrevealed, but we hope to return to the
site and finish our job,'' team member Michael Schmidt said
Tuesday.
	   The team, financed by German television station NDR, had
detected what appeared to be a large cache of metal buried in a
lagoon near the coastal village of Preila and suspected it could be
the remnants of Czar Peter the Great's Amber Room.
	   The room's 50 square meters (500 square feet) of intricately
carved amber panels, was looted during the Nazi siege of Leningrad,
now St. Petersburg. Germany has contended that the panels were
destroyed during the Soviet Union's bombing of Koenigsberg, now the
Russian enclave of Kaliningrad, about 75 kilometers (45 miles)
south of the search site.
	   But others have claimed the treasure was buried by the Nazis.
	   The treasure-hunters were hampered in their efforts by an
improvised cofferdam that leaked. Being unable to drain the search
area completely made excavation difficult.

Nigeria to hold presidential vote Feb. 27, 1999
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with additional details, background. No
pickup. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria's long-awaited presidential
elections will be held on Feb. 27, 1999, in line with promises from
military leaders to hand over power to civilians next May, the
electoral commission announced Tuesday.
	   Elections for the national assembly in Africa's most populous
country will be held one week earlier, on Feb. 20, the commission
said in a statement.
	   Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, who came to power in early June after
the sudden death of the former dictator, Gen. Sani Abacha, said
last month that Nigeria would hold presidential elections in the
first quarter of 1999, and turn power over to a civilian government
in May.
	   Local government council elections will be held on Dec. 5 of
this year and voting for state assemblies and governors will be on
Jan. 9, 1999, the commission said.
	   The president will be sworn in on May 29.
	   The voting is being highly anticipated in Nigeria, where
Abacha's death has brought about a sudden shift in the country's
political landscape.
	   Abubakar, while still widely viewed with suspicion by Nigeria's
political opposition, quickly set about moving Nigeria on a
different course from his predecessor, whose brutal and corrupt
rule left Nigeria crippled. He freed political prisoners, met with
international envoys and has repeatedly vowed to allow a return to
civilian rule in Nigeria, which has been ruled by military
governments for all but 10 years since achieving independence from
Britain in 1960.

	   HEBRON, West Bank, (AP) - Even as a peace deal with the
Palestinians appeared closer at hand, Prime Minister Benjamin on
Tuesday paid a surprise visit to Jewish settlers in this tense
Palestinian town and promised to expand their community.
	   Netanyahu's gesture was aimed at his hardline critics, including
many settler leaders, who have demanded that Israel break off
negotiations with the Palestinians following the killing of a
well-known Hebron rabbi, apparently by a Palestinian, last week.
	   Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat reportedly have
softened their positions on an Israeli troop withdrawal in the West
Bank after a 17-month stalemate, though both sides said Tuesday
that several issues remained unresolved.
	   The progress made in recent days apparently was not sufficient
to persuade U.S. Mideast peace envoy Dennis Ross to return to the
region to try and finalize a deal.
	   In an unannounced condolence visit to Hebron on Tuesday,
Netanyahu said he would build new homes for the 450 Jews living in
the divided city of 130,000 Palestinians.
	   ``I care. I want them (settlers) to have security and permanency
and expansion and they deserve it,'' Netanyahu said.
	   He said proposals to build permanent housing in the Jewish
enclave of Tel Romeida, a small trailer park where the rabbi was
killed last week, were submitted for approval Tuesday.
	   Netanyahu also approved the construction of an apartment
building for settlers next to the enclave of Beit Hadassah, the
Yediot Ahronot daily said. Land next to Beit Hadassah was recently
cleared for construction.
	   Finance Minister Yaakov Neeman, meanwhile, has set aside 10
million shekels (drls 2.7 million) for Tel Romeida construction,
and on Monday parliament's Finance Ministry approved an additional
90 million shekels (dlrs 24.2 million) for settlement expansion
throughout the West Bank.
	   The United States offered a proposal in January for an Israeli
withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank, in exchange for
Palestinian security gestures. The Palestinians accepted the
proposal but Israel did not and the sides have been haggling since.
	   On Monday, Arafat said new Israeli ideas submitted in recent
days were ``a beginning'' and that he would accept an Israeli
formula under which some of the land slated for withdrawal would be
nature reserves where Palestinians would not be allowed to settle.
	   However, Palestinian Information Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo said
Tuesday the Palestinians would not agree to Israel declaring some
areas ``nature reserves'' only for the purpose of a pullback.
	   Abed Rabbo also said the Palestinians sought clarifications
about the extent of control the Palestinians would have over the
nature reserve.

Two Defense Agency jets missing in northern Japan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Two Japanese Self-Defense Force F-1 fighter jets
disappeared from radar screens while on a training flight Tuesday
night over the Pacific Ocean, the Defense Agency said.
	   The Defense Agency dispatched helicopters to search for the
single-pilot jets after radio contact was lost at about 7 p.m.
(1000 GMT), but they have not been found, an agency spokesman said.
	   The jets disappeared about 120 kilometers (75 miles) southeast
of the U.S. Air Force's Misawa air base.
	   The planes took off from Misawa at 6:30 p.m. (0930 GMT), along
with a third plane, to conduct low-altitude night flying practice,
said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The jets were piloted by 1st Lt. Hirokazu Nagai and 1st Lt.
Madoka Nakaya, both 29, he said.
	   Misawa is located 560 kilometers (350 miles) northwest of Tokyo
in Aomori Prefecture (state).

<TEXT>
	   ARKALYK, Kazakstan (AP) _ Three Russian cosmonauts, including a
former aide to President Boris Yeltsin, landed in the Kazak desert
on Tuesday after a flawless descent from the Mir space station.
	   The Soyuz TM-27 spacecraft touched down at 9:23 a.m. Moscow time
(0523 GMT) near the town of Arkalyk in north-central Kazakstan. It
carried crew commander Talgat Musabayev and his colleague Nikolai
Budarin, who spent 207 days on board the Mir, and former
presidential advisor Yuri Baturin, who spent 12 days there
performing scientific experiments.
	   ``The landing spot is good, smooth, there is a swift east wind
blowing and the weather is fair, Musabayev was quoted as saying by
the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Russia has a 20-year lease agreement on the former Soviet
Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakstan and Russian cosmonauts also use
the Kazak steppe as their landing site.
	   Shortly after the landing, Yeltsin sent a telegram
congratulating the crew on a successful mission. ``The successful
completion of your mission is another bright page in the history of
our space research,'' he said.
	   Kazakstan's President Nursultan Nazarbayev met with the crew
shortly after the landing and wished them a speedy adaptation after
weightlessness.
	   The three cosmonauts will be flown to Star City, a cosmonauts
training center near Moscow, for a post-flight rehabilitation that
usually takes about a month.
	   Cosmonauts Gennady Padalko and Sergei Avdeyev, who traveled to
the Mir with Baturin, remain aboard the space station and are
scheduled to return to Earth in February.

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Grenades or bombs exploded on three
long-distance buses in Uganda Tuesday, killing at least 21 people,
including a child, a private radio and a regional spokeswoman said.
	   Capital FM, a nationwide radio network, said explosions occurred
on buses heading for the Rwanda capital, Kigali, the northern town
of Gulu and Kasese in the west.
	   Police said they had no details but were trying to contact their
officers in the regions where the explosions occurred.
	   Mbarara district spokeswoman Tumwine A. said a grenade exploded
on the Kampala-to-Kigali bus owned by the Comesa Bus Co., and at
least 20 people were killed, either in the blast or when the bus
then collided with a mini-van at Sanga, 34 kilometers (21 miles)
north of Mbarara.
	   Capital FM put the number of dead at 30.
	   The radio said there was another explosion in Lyantonde on a bus
headed for Kasese in western Uganda. Lyantonde is 214 kilometers
(133 miles) southwest of Kampala, also on the road to Mbarara.
	   There was no immediate information on casualties in the
Lyantonde explosion on the bus owned by the Bulangiti Bus Co.
	   The radio said a third explosion in a bus headed for Gulu killed
a child. The radio said the bus, belonging to the Otada Bus Co.,
had stopped in Nakasongola, 115 kilometers (71 miles) north of
Kampala because of mechanical problems, and all passengers except
the child got out. The explosion occurred shortly afterwards, and
the child was killed.
	   The radio said it appeared that the explosions were caused by
devices hidden in luggage stowed under the passenger section of the
buses.
	   In Mbarara, 282 kilometers (175 miles) southwest of Kampala,
workers at Mbarara Hospital said the injured began arriving around
11 a.m. (0800 GMT). At least 10 were admitted for treatment,
several in surgery, according to the hospital superintendent, who
would not give his name.
	   He said it was possible the number of dead was greater than the
number of injured.
	   ``We have not yet assessed whether it was the impact of the
explosion or of the collision,'' that caused most of the injuries,
the superintendent said.
	   Since the beginning of the year, grenade attacks on bars and
restaurants in Kampala have killed at least six people and injured
more than a dozen.
	   The government has blamed most of the attacks on rebels
belonging to the Allied Democratic Forces who usually stage attacks
in western Uganda around Kasese from bases inside the Democratic
Republic of Congo.
	   Sudan-based rebels of the Lord's Resistance Army have been
staging attacks and kidnapping children in northern Gulu district
for the past 12 years. International aid agencies estimate at least
250,000 people have been displaced by the attacks.
	   In Nov. 1997, police blamed a series of grenade attacks that
killed nine, including a prominent politician, on organized crime.

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Germans got their first look Tuesday at the
leading design for a national Holocaust Memorial, but when and
whether it actually will be built remained an open question.
	   Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the strongest promoter of the decade-old
project, backed off his pledge Monday to push ahead with it before
national elections on Sept. 27, saying he wanted to avoid turning
such a ``sensitive subject'' into a campaign issue.
	   Kohl challenger Gerhard Schroeder, who is leading in the polls,
welcomed the delay. On German television Monday night, he said he
was not against a memorial in principle, but wasn't sure whether
the chosen site and above all the scale of the project was
appropriate.
	   ``I think that these questions will now be widely discussed, and
the Bundestag will participate,'' he said, referring to the lower
house of parliament.
	   The head of the private initiative behind the project, Lea Rosh,
called the delay ``a declaration of bankruptcy'' and said she
feared a Schroeder victory could spell the end for the memorial.
	   But the leader of Berlin's Jewish community, Andreas Nachama,
welcomed what he called a ``pause for thinking,'' saying he didn't
believe it wise to rush the project through.
	   The four finalists were put on public display Tuesday as Berlin
officials met to debate the project. The front-runner, favored by
Kohl, is a labyrinth of 2,700 pillars resembling a cemetery. It is
designed by U.S. architect Peter Eisenman.
	   Although the Eisenman design has been significantly scaled down
from the original proposal of 4,000 pillars, Mayor Eberhard Diepgen
and other critics complain it is still too ``monumental'' and wrong
for the site, just south of the historic Brandenburg Gate.

	   SEVILLE, Spain (AP)_ With just three days to go before the start
of the Spanish league, former Chilean national team coach Vicente
Cantatore was Tuesday named new boss at Betis following the
surprise resgination of Portugal's Antonio Oliveira.
	   Cantatore, who will be Betis' third coach this summer, was
sacked by Spanish side Valladolid last year. He went on to coach
Sporting Lisbon but resigned after only two weeks there for
'personal reasons'.
	   Oliveira, a former Portuguese national team coach, broke his two
season contract with Betis only a month after replacing Luis
Aragones who retired. Oliveira gave no immediate explanation for
his resignation.
	   Boasting new Brazilian signing Denilson, Betis gets league play
rolling Saturday when it travels to division newcomer Alaves. Betis
finished No. 8 last season.

Iraq to UN: chief arms inspector's public statements must end
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARIAM SAMI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq is demanding that the United Nations
stop the chief U.N. arms inspector from speaking to the media about
the search for banned weapons in Iraq, the government said in a
letter made public Tuesday.
	   The letter, from Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz to U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, complained that the comments by
Richard Butler were part of his effort to keep trade sanctions on
Iraq.
	   Aziz also complained that Butler was acting ``as a service to
the policies of a specific country,'' echoing Iraq's frequent
complaint that Butler was acting on behalf of the United States,
not the whole United Nations, in doing his job.
	   The letter, dated Sunday, came after Butler told The New York
Times that he suspected Iraq was trying to secretly increase the
range of its missiles in violation of U.N. sanctions limiting their
distance to 150 kilometers (80 miles).
	   Butler, whose inspectors must certify Iraq has eliminated its
weapons of mass destruction before U.N. sanctions against the
country can be lifted, has been a regular target of Iraq's
government.
	   It complained last January about public statements on arms
inspections by Butler, head of the U.N. Special Commission, or
UNSCOM. It said then that Butler's job was to report his findings
to the U.N. Security Council, not to newspapers.
	   In his latest letter, Aziz expressed disappointment that Annan
had not put a stop to Butler's public comments.
	   ``It is very sad that this odious behavior by UNSCOM's executive
director is repeated with no reaction from your side,'' Aziz wrote.
	   ``We hope that the Security Council, with advice from you, will
put an end to this instigating manner'' of Butler, his letter said.
	   The letter also said Iraq cannot upgrade the missiles' ranges
due to continuous inspections and surprise visits to potential arms
sites.
	   However, Iraq suspended its dealings with the inspectors on Aug.
5, preventing them from working under the U.N.-Iraq agreements that
require the U.N. examiners to be accompanied by Iraqi escorts.
	   On Monday, Annan's envoy to Iraq, Prakash Shah, briefed the
Security Council and said he failed to persuade Iraq on a visit
last week to resume its cooperation. Only long-term monitoring of
already marked sites is ongoing, using cameras and other equipment.
	   The sanctions on Iraq, imposed after its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait, prevent the free export of Iraq's oil, its most valuable
commodity.
	   Iraq has long insisted it destroyed all its lethal weapons
systems, but Butler has accused the government of President Saddam
Hussein of hiding weapons and the means to make more.
	   Iraq has described Butler and other UNSCOM inspectors as
``spies'' for the United States and Britain. The official press
runs regular editorials mocking Butler as ``rabid dog'' and
America's ``loyal servant.''

Search for Amber Room halted
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KLAIPEDA, Lithuania (AP) _ German treasure-hunters hoping to
find the Czarist Amber Room treasure in a Lithuanian lagoon have
halted their search due to equipment problems, but intend to come
back.
	   ``The secret remains unrevealed, but we hope to return to the
site and finish our job,'' team member Michael Schmidt said
Tuesday.
	   The team, financed by German television station NDR, had
detected what appeared to be a large cache of metal buried in a
lagoon near the coastal village of Preila and suspected it could be
the remnants of Czar Peter the Great's Amber Room.
	   The room's 50 square meters (500 square feet) of intricately
carved amber panels, was looted during the Nazi siege of Leningrad,
now St. Petersburg. Germany has contended that the panels were
destroyed during the Soviet Union's bombing of Koenigsberg, now the
Russian enclave of Kaliningrad, about 75 kilometers (45 miles)
south of the search site.
	   But others have claimed the treasure was buried by the Nazis.
	   The treasure-hunters were hampered in their efforts by an
improvised cofferdam that leaked. Being unable to drain the search
area completely made excavation difficult.

Nigeria to hold presidential vote Feb. 27, 1999
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with soldiers being forbidden from
joining parties, background on 1993 election. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria's long-awaited presidential
elections will be held on Feb. 27, 1999, in line with promises from
military leaders to hand over power to civilians next May, the
electoral commission announced Tuesday.
	   Elections for the national assembly in Africa's most populous
country will be held one week earlier, on Feb. 20, the Independent
National Electoral Commission said in a statement.
	   Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, who came to power in early June after
the sudden death of the former dictator, Gen. Sani Abacha, said
last month that Nigeria would hold presidential elections in the
first quarter of 1999, and turn power over to a civilian government
in May.
	   Local government council elections will be held on Dec. 5 of
this year and voting for state assemblies and governors will be on
Jan. 9, 1999, the commission said.
	   The president will be sworn in on May 29.
	   Electoral commission rules forbid members of the armed forces,
police, and civil servants from joining political parties.
	   The voting is being highly anticipated in Nigeria, where
Abacha's death has brought about a sudden shift in the country's
political landscape.
	   Abubakar, while still widely viewed with suspicion by Nigeria's
political opposition, quickly set about moving Nigeria on a
different course from his predecessor, whose brutal and corrupt
rule left Nigeria crippled. He freed political prisoners, met with
international envoys and has repeatedly vowed to allow a return to
civilian rule in Nigeria, which has been ruled by military
governments for all but 10 years since achieving independence from
Britain in 1960.
	   Nigeria's last presidential elections, held in 1993, was
annulled by Abacha, who one year later imprisoned the apparent
winner, millionaire businessman Moshood Abiola.
	   Abiola died in prison in July, just before Abubakar was to have
freed him.

Kohl calls Obuchi to discuss world economic problems
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl called Japanese
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi on Tuesday to learn about Japan's
proposed economic reforms and discuss the Russian financial crisis,
a German government spokesman said.
	   In a statement, the spokesman said Obuchi told Kohl ``about the
program adopted by his government to revive the (Japanese) economy
and carry out structural reforms of the financial sector, as well
as progress being made'' in putting them into effect.
	   Kohl stressed that Japan's proposed reforms are of ``crucial
importance'' for economic development ``in Asia and beyond,'' the
statement said.
	   Beyond that, both men discussed the ``economic development in
the Asian region and the current situation in Russia.'' Kohl and
Obuchi agreed that governments in Asia and Russia had to implement
reforms agreed on with the International Monetary Fund.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police, on the offensive in
Kosovo, were accused Tuesday of killing three ethnic Albanian
workers for the Mother Teresa charity who were taking humanitarian
aid to refugees.
	   The latest report of violence came amid a storm of new
international criticism of the Serbs for their attacks in
secessionist Kosovo.
	   The ethnic Albanian daily Koha Ditore said the three were killed
Monday after police allowed them to pass through a checkpoint near
Malisevo, a former rebel stronghold in central Kosovo that Serb
forces overran last month.
	   Citing eyewitnesses, Koha Ditore said police subsequently
shelled the tractor they were riding on to take aid into the
region, one of the most densely refugee-populated in the war-torn
province of southern Serbia.
	   The Albanians' Kosovo Information Center gave a similar account.
But the Pristina branch of the Mother Teresa charitable foundation
said it could not confirm the deaths because it had no
communication with field crews.
	   The foundation has been distributing wheat flour, soap and other
aid provided by the World Food Program and the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees. Humanitarian agencies estimate about
50,000 Kosovo refugees are trying to survive in the open.
	   As U.S. envoy Christopher Hill prepared to meet Tuesday in
Belgrade with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, there were new
reports of fighting and more condemnation of the Serbs.
	   Serbian police and the Yugoslav army continued shelling several
villages southwest of Pristina in their drive to crush separatist
resistance among Kosovo's majority ethnic Albanians.
	   According to the Kosovo Information Center, after killing three
ethnic Albanians in clashes Monday the Serbs were targeting seven
villages in the Suva Reka region on Tuesday and were setting ablaze
houses after dousing them with gasoline.
	   ``We denounce the continuing violence in Kosovo which is forcing
more people to flee,'' spokesman Kris Janowski of the UNHCR said
Tuesday in Geneva. ``The situation is getting worse and worse.''
	   He said the U.N. agency is planning to double its staff in
Pristina to around 14 but has been hindered by delays in obtaining
visas from Belgrade authorities.
	   Amnesty International also deplored the violence, and called
attention to both the vulnerability of women to human rights abuses
in Kosovo and the rising number of victims who have gone missing.
	   ``The disappeared and missing are the hidden victims of
Kosovo,'' the London-based human rights group said. It said all
ethnic groups are affected: ``Ethnic Albanians have disappeared in
Serbian police hands; Serbs, Albanians and Roma are missing after
abduction by the KLA.''
	   In New York on Monday, the U.N. Security Council urged a
cease-fire in the Yugoslav province and warned of a humanitarian
disaster if fighting continues. But the statement reflected the
lack of any consensus among council members on how to halt the
conflict.
	   ``The authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the
Kosovo Albanians must achieve a political solution to the issue of
Kosovo,'' the 15-member council said in a statement. It said that
as winter approaches, the plight of refugees will worsen.
	   The Serbs, meanwhile, accused the ethnic Albanians' Kosovo
Liberation Army of making more guerrilla attacks against them. The
pro-Serb Media Center said a group of rebels ambushed an ambulance
on Monday, wounding the driver, a doctor and another passenger.

<TEXT>
	   SEVILLE, Spain (AP)_ With just three days to go before the start
of the Spanish league, former Chilean national team coach Vicente
Cantatore was Tuesday named new boss at Betis following the
surprise resgination of Portugal's Antonio Oliveira.
	   Cantatore, who will be Betis' third coach this summer, was
sacked by Spanish side Valladolid last year. He went on to coach
Sporting Lisbon but resigned after only two weeks there for
'personal reasons'.
	   Oliveira, a former Portuguese national team coach, broke his two
season contract with Betis only a month after replacing Luis
Aragones who retired. Oliveira gave no immediate explanation for
his resignation.
	   Boasting new Brazilian signing Denilson, Betis gets league play
rolling Saturday when it travels to division newcomer Alaves. Betis
finished No. 8 last season.

	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria's long-awaited presidential
elections will be held on Feb. 27, 1999, in line with promises from
military leaders to hand over power to civilians next May, the
electoral commission announced Tuesday.
	   Elections for the national assembly in Africa's most populous
country will be held one week earlier, on Feb. 20, the Independent
National Electoral Commission said in a statement.
	   Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, who came to power in early June after
the sudden death of the former dictator, Gen. Sani Abacha, said
last month that Nigeria would hold presidential elections in the
first quarter of 1999, and turn power over to a civilian government
in May.
	   Local government council elections will be held on Dec. 5 of
this year and voting for state assemblies and governors will be on
Jan. 9, 1999, the commission said.
	   The president will be sworn in on May 29.
	   Electoral commission rules forbid members of the armed forces
and police from joining political parties.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Vincenzo Nardiello has pulled out of his Sept. 5 WBC
super-middleweight title fight against champion Richie Woodhall
because of a leg injury.
	   Nardiello tore his left calf muscle in training last week and
will be out of the ring for about three weeks, the ANSA news agency
reported Tuesday. The Italian, who once held the belt, said he
thinks the bout could be staged in October or November.
	   Nardiello and Woodhall had been scheduled to meet in Telford,
England, for what would have been Woodhall's first title defense
since taking the title in March from South Africa's Thulane ``Sugar
Boy'' Malinga.

Israeli helicopter strike kills guerrilla in south Lebanon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to UPDATE with air raid, six civilians and one
guerrilla wounded; TRIMS; no pickup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli helicopters hunted down and killed
a guerrilla commander and warplanes blasted suspected militant
hideouts as fighting escalated in southern Lebanon on Tuesday,
security officials said.
	   Guerrillas detonated a roadside bomb that killed an
Israeli-backed militiaman near Jezzine, a town 30 kilometers (19
miles) north of the Israeli border, the officials said.
	   Israel retaliated with an artillery bombardment and an air
strike on suspected guerrilla hideouts in the mountains around
Jezzine, officials said, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity. Shells exploded in the town of Mashghara and the village
of Sohmor. A car was set ablaze and several houses were damaged.
	   Six Lebanese civilians, including a six-year-old boy, were
injured in the shelling and one Hezbollah guerrilla was hurt in the
air raid, the officials said.
	   Tuesday's fighting marked a sharp rise in tensions that have
been building steadily since last week, when three Israeli soldiers
were killed in two guerrilla attacks.
	   In the raid that killed the guerrilla commander, two Israeli
helicopter-gunships flew in from the sea and attacked a car, a blue
BMW sedan, as it was driving along a coastal road about 15
kilometers (10 miles) north of the Israeli border and only about a
kilometer (mile) from a checkpoint of U.N. peacekeepers.
	   Security officials said a single rocket hit the car and killed
Hossam al-Amin, 31, a military commander of the pro-Syrian Shiite
Muslim Amal guerrilla group. The blast tossed the vehicle into the
air and it landed about 10 meters (yards) from the road.
	   A spokesman for Amal acknowledged the killing.
	   Israel has previously used helicopter gunships to hunt down
commanders of Shiite guerrillas who are waging a war to dislodge
Israel's occupation army and allied SLA militiamen from a border
zone in southern Lebanon.

Slovene, Croat officials meet to try and soothe relations

<TEXT>
	   MOKRICE, Slovenia (AP) _ The foreign ministers of Slovenia and
Croatia met Tuesday to try and diffuse mounting tensions that have
threatened in cut a rift in relations between the two neighbors.
	   Slovene Foreign Minister Boris Frlec and his Croatian
counterpart Mate Granic were to discuss disputes, including several
undefined border points and property issues, that have remained
unsolved since 1991, when the two countries simultaneously
proclaimed independence from the former Yugoslavia.
	   Two conflicts that erupted in the past month shook their
previously cordial relations and brought the old squabbles back to
light. The first came on July 30, when Slovenia suddenly cut off
Croatia's power supply from a mutually owned nuclear energy plant
inside its territory, claiming the Croats were not paying their
share of the plant's operational expenses.
	   A week later, the Slovene town of Secovi, on the river Dragonja,
secretly registered four disputed border hamlets in its record
books as belonging to its municipality.
	   Since then, both governments have engaged in damage control, but
nothing has improved. No breakthrough on the stickier issues are
expected at Tuesday's meeting, but some of the smaller disputes
could be resolved in an effort to reduce tensions.
	   Economics ministers and some other government officials are also
attending the meeting.
	   Croatia and Slovenia emerged from the Communist-era Yugoslavia
with the most advanced economies. Because Slovenia also avoided a
long, bloody conflict following its declaration of independence, it
is a front-runner for joining the European Union and under
consideration for making the next round of invitations for NATO
ascension.

Yeltsin and Vietnam's Luong pledge to restore Soviet-era

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Chernomyrdin meeting Luong in grafs 6, 7. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin and his visiting
Vietnamese counterpart Tran Duc Luong pledged Tuesday to rebuild
their countries' Soviet-era alliance.
	   ``As a minimum, we should restore our past relations,
concentrating on the oil and gas complex,'' Yeltsin told reporters
after the talks in the Kremlin.
	   Economic and military ties between Russia and Vietnam had
loosened in the final years before the 1991 Soviet collapse as
Moscow gave up support of its former satellite. Russia has
continued to help Vietnam run its offshore oil fields, but the
level of cooperation was markedly down from the past.
	   Yeltsin and Luong said in a joint statement that the two
countries would boost joint oil production to 15-16 million tons a
year and also build Vietnam's first oil refinery, which would be
capable of processing 6.5 million tons of crude a year, Russian
news reports said.
	   The statement also said that Russia would help build power
plants in Vietnam and develop other industries. The two leaders
also discussed military cooperation, pledging that it would not be
``directed against any third country and wouldn't tilt the balance
of power in the region.''
	   In his first meeting with a foreign representative since his
reappointment this weekend, Acting Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin also met with Luong Tuesday.
	   ``Vietnam is gaining momentum in its development. Russians
working there have contributed to that,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency
quoted Chernomyrdin as saying.
	   Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev will visit Vietnam in the
next few months to discuss military cooperation. Yeltsin accepted
an invitation to visit Vietnam some time next year.
	   ``There are far fewer problems than I thought'' in
Russian-Vietnamese relations, Yeltsin said following the talks.
``The foundation built by our two countries has remained.''

Unity, in Angola and in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where at
least four nations are embroiled in a civil war.
	   The group was formed at a presidential summit in Pretoria over
the weekend that called for an immediate cease-fire in Congo, where
fighting threatens to engulf the region and poses its most severe
security threat in four years.
	   Zimbabwean and Angolan troops and warplanes are backing Congo
President Laurent Kabila. Rwanda and Uganda are backing the rebels.
	   Namibia has reportedly sent war materiel to Kabila, and Zambia
is considering doing the same.
	   The SADC envoys plan to meet on Tuesday with OAU Secretary
General Salim Ahmed Salim in Addis Ababa, a foreign affairs
statement said.
	   Salim is to join the group for meetings with Angolan President
Jose Eduardo Dos Santos in Luanda and with Kabila in Kinshasa. It
was not clear when those meetings will be held.
	   The mission's chances for success appear slim.
	   Kabila's government on Monday rejected peace talks until Rwanda
and Uganda withdraw troops Kabila claims are backing the rebels.
	   Nzo said in the statement that Congolese rebels accepted the
peace proposal, according to assurances he received from their
spokesman Bizima Karaha, a former minister in Kabila's cabinet.
	   In other shuttle diplomacy, ministers from Gabon and Congo's
neighbor, the Republic of Congo, traveled Tuesday to Angola,
reportedly with messages from their presidents.
	   Kabila's forces have begun to turn back the rebels with the
reported help of 1,500 Angolan and 600 Zimbabwean troops.
	   In Zimbabwe, Foreign Minister Stan Mudenge defended his
country's military involvement, saying it was a defensive move to
help Kabila fend off invasion from Rwanda and Uganda.
	   The presidents of Uganda and Rwanda have denied their
involvement and agreed to the summit's cease-fire call.
	   The intervention issue has split SADC countries, with South
Africa's President Nelson Mandela, who chairs the group, leading a
mediation approach and rejecting military use.
	   Zimbabwe intends to pay for the Angolan and Zimbabwe
contributions, sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said in
Harare on Tuesday. Where the money would come from in the
impoverished nation is unknown.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq is demanding that the United Nations
stop the chief U.N. arms inspector from making public statements to
the media about the search for weapons in Iraq, the government said

Greeks told they no longer have to swear to God
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greeks may no longer have to swear to God
to get a government job, it was reported Tuesday.
	   But they won't be able to work in the some parts of the public
sector if their religious beliefs don't let them use weapons or
computers.
	   According to a decision issued Monday by Greece's highest
administrative court, the Council of State, people seeking a job in
the civil or military services may soon be offered an alternative
to the mandatory religious oath.
	   The court ruled that an ``oath of honor and conscience'' will be
accepted from applicants for positions in a new border guard unit.
	   The decision is expected to set a precedent for all public
sector jobs. A declaration of allegiance to the constitution and
country will remain compulsory.
	   It could also further bolster a growing debate for a
constitutional amendment to fully separate church from state.
	   Greece's Orthodox Church is recognized as the country's official
religion and strongly influences public life. More than 90 percent
of the country's 10.2 million people are baptized into the church.
	   The church has come under growing criticism for its interference
in politics and foreign policy. Among other things, it recently
opposed efforts to bring Greece in line with the rest of the
European Union by abolishing religious affiliation from state
issued identity cards.
	   The court also ruled that applicants will be banned from some
state jobs if their religious beliefs interfere with the ability to
perform their duties, such as refusal to take up arms or use a
computer.
	   It was the second such decision issued by the court this year. A
previous ruling upheld a complaint by a theology student who was
not given his degree because he refused to take a religious oath
mandated by his state university.

Muslim clerics close mosque after arrest of Palestinian
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Muslim clerics closed Islam's third holiest
shrine to tourists for several hours in protest Tuesday after
Israeli border police arrested two Palestinians in the mosque
compound.
	   The Al Aqsa Mosque compound, like other Islamic sites in
Jerusalem, enjoys a great deal of autonomy and Israeli authorities
are only permitted to enter under certain circumstances.
	   The incident began when two border policemen stopped two
brothers, Mohammed and Shadi Hidadit, for an identity check in the
walled Old City.
	   A scuffle ensued and the brothers ran away and sought refuge in
the nearby Al Aqsa compound. The policemen followed them into the
compound to arrest them. Three mosque guards intervened and
scuffled with the border policemen, said Walid Zurda, a bystander
who witnessed the incident.
	   The Islamic Trust, or Waqf, which administers the compound,
closed Al Aqsa to tourists for several hours as Waqf director Adnan
Husseini met with Jerusalem's police commander, Yair Yitzhaki.
	   Husseini said the Waqf would not except the presence of border
policemen in the compound, which is known to Jews as the Temple
Mount, the site of the ancient Jewish Temple.
	   Meanwhile, the Israeli daily Maariv said Tuesday that Israeli
authorities have beefed up security near the Al Aqsa compound
because of growing concern it could be targeted by Jewish
extremists.

Cases of trafficking in women have doubled since 1993 in Germany
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Cases of criminals forcing women from
eastern Europe into prostitution in Germany have doubled in the
past five years, and officials said Tuesday the problem was
probably even worse.
	   Last year 1,091 cases involving trafficking in women were
recorded nationwide, twice the level in 1993. But many cases are
never reported, meaning the actual figure is probably far higher,
said Bavarian Interior Minister Guenter Beckstein.
	   Most of the women come from economically depressed parts of
eastern Europe: 39 percent from the former Soviet Union, 18 percent
from Poland, and 12 percent from the Czech Republic and Slovakia.
	   They are often coaxed by traffickers with promises of a better
life in Germany, only to be coerced into prostitution, said Ursula
Maennle, Bavarian minister for federal affairs.
	   ``Many of these young women ... were abused and exploited here
in the most brutal manner,'' Maennle said.
	   Yet she and Beckstein said they opposed allowing the victims to
stay in Germany, arguing it would only serve to exacerbate the
problem by luring even more women to the country.
	   Instead, Germany should offer the women social and financial aid
through programs in their home countries, easing their return,
Maennle said. German cooperation with social services and aid
organizations in Poland, for example, has already met with success.
	   ``We must offer these women protection and a future to win their
confidence,'' Maennle said.

North Korea says U.N. rights resolution aims to destroy country
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ North Korea said Tuesday a U.N. human rights panel
is aiming to destroy it by singling it out in a resolution urging
compliance with world agreements to protect human rights.
	   ``There is no independent country that would accept this kind of
resolution,'' said Kim Song Chol, a diplomat from the North Korean
mission to U.N. offices in Geneva.
	   The panel, which comprises 26 independent experts who routinely
pass resolutions criticizing many countries, said it ``strongly
urges the government to allow and facilitate inquiries'' by
independent national and international human rights organizations.
	   It urged human rights bodies to give more attention to North
Korea and call attention to the ``food shortages and other economic
hardships endured by its citizens.''
	   A year ago North Korea took the unprecedented step of
withdrawing from a U.N. human rights accord, the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, because of a more critical
statement by the same panel.
	   Panel members said then that there had been ``persistent and
concordant allegations that grave violations of human rights are
being committed in that country.''
	   The 1997 resolution noted allegations of mass internment in
``administrative detention centers'' and ``serious restrictions''
on the rights of North Korean citizens to leave or enter their
country.
	   The carefully worded resolution adopted Tuesday on a 19-4 vote
by the U.N. sub-commission on human rights, reaffirmed that ``all
member states have the obligation to promote and protect human
rights and fundamental freedoms.''
	   The government should allow human rights organizations to
publish and distribute all their findings inside North Korea, the
resolution said.
	   ``We categorically reject the resolution aimed at isolating and
destroying our country,'' said Kim.
	   He complained to reporters that the sub-commission members had
drafted the resolution without consulting the North Korean
government delegation.
	   ``The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
provides genuine human rights to its people,'' he said, adding that
North Korea ``highly cherishes its sovereignty and has strong
independence.''

Marsh &AMP; McLennan launches takeover bid for Sedgwick
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Marsh &AMP; McLennan Cos. Inc., a U.S. based-insurance
giant, launched a bid Tuesday to take over Sedgwick Group PLC, a
deal that would create the world's largest insurance broker.
	   Marsh &AMP; McLennan bid 1.25 billion pounds (dlrs 2.05 billion) for
British-based Sedgwick.
	   The bid price _ 2.25 pounds (dlrs 3.69) a share _ was 58 percent
above Sedgwick's closing share price Monday of 1.42 pounds (dlrs.
2.33).
	   Kevin Ryan, an analyst at Nikko Europe, said Sedgwick has assets
of about 200 million pounds (dlrs 328 million), so New York-based
Marsh &AMP; McLennan would be paying more than 1 billion pounds (dlrs
1.6 billion) in ``goodwill.''
	   ``That makes this deal pretty risky,'' he said.
	   The merger comes in the middle of consolidation moves throughout
the insurance industry. Willis Corron Group PLC, another British
insurance giant, announced last month that it was being taken over
by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, a U.S. buyout specialist.
	   European regulators must now clear the merger.
	   In its announcement Tuesday, Marsh &AMP; McLennan said it expected
the deal to boost earnings in 2000.
	   Sedgwick employs 16,000 people worldwide. Marsh &AMP; McLennan has
36,000 employees.

New campaign targets problem in heavy-drinking nation
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Rough cut images of road accidents slowly
blend into the face of a popular racing driver who turns over an
empty beer glass and says: ``Don't be stupid. Don't let yourself be
killed.''
	   The 30-second television spot that begins airing Wednesday
launches a one-week campaign against drunk driving sponsored by
four major brewers in formerly communist Poland's latest step
toward Western-style social awareness.
	   Trying to curb deeply imbued drinking habits in this nation of
39 million people is a serious task. No party, wedding, christening
or funeral in the devoutly Catholic country goes without heavy
consumption of vodka, wine and beer. Few think twice before driving
home.
	   ``We don't ask our clients to stop drinking our beer, but we ask
them not to get behind the wheel if they have drunk,'' said Andrzej
Dlugosz, corporate affairs director at the Elbrewery Co. LTD, which
is co-owned by the Dutch beer makers Grolsch.
	   So far this year, more than 40,000 road accidents in Poland have
killed 3,432 people and injured almost 52,000. Police say 20
percent of those crashes _ one in five _ was due to drunken
driving.
	   The campaign, called ``Drunken drivers ferry death,'' represents
a new direction for Elbrewery and the other beer makers _ Lech
Browary Wielkopolski S.A., Zywiec and Browary Tyskie. For the first
time, they are adopting public responsibility campaigns of their
Western co-owners and other leading brewers.
	   ``If it stops at least one person from drinking _ beer, vodka or
any other alcohol _ before getting into the car, it will be a
success,'' said Grazyna Komerska, a police officer at the national
headquarters.
	   The campaign's launch Wednesday comes as Poles begin heading
home from their annual August holiday, filling the nation's mostly
two-lane roads for the ensuing week.
	   Three times a day for a week, during prime afternoon and evening
viewing hours, the television spot will run on both state channels.
It begins with Krzysztof Holowczyc, the 1997 European Rally
champion from Poland, wearing a blindfold as bottles and glasses
fall around him.
	   Then come the accident scenes, set to sounds of crashing and
grinding _ cars overturned or crumbled, a woman in a crushed
vehicle beside her slumped-over partner.
	   Holowczyc reappears and removes the blindfold.
	   ``I don't drive after alcohol,'' he says, peering into the
camera. ``Don't be stupid. Don't let yourself be killed.''
	   The sponsors plan to continue the campaign after the television
spots end, though they don't know what form it will take. They
refused to provide a specific figure for the cost of the television
spots, saying only that the campaign cost the same as a regular
advertising campaign.
	   Poland has one of the highest alcohol consumption rates in
Europe, with an average of about nine liters of pure spirit per
person in 1996. That was 25 percent less than the 12-liter average
in 1993, due to government education programs and tougher penalties
imposed for selling alcohol to minors under the age of 18.

Former French prime minister under investigation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: AMs. UPDATES with background on other scandals, detail on
current investigation. Changes byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By DEBORAH SEWARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A fake-employment scandal in the Paris city hall
widened Tuesday when a judge placed former Prime Minister Alain
Juppe under investigation for allegedly misusing public funds,
while serving under then-Mayor Jacques Chirac.
	   Judge Patrick Desmure is investigating a system under which
workers on the city hall payroll were actually working for the
conservative Rally for the Republic party, which Chirac founded and
Juppe served as secretary general.
	   A growing number of top French politicians have become embroiled
in corruption scandals recently, including former Foreign Minister
Roland Dumas and ex-Defense Minister Francois Leotard.
	   But the French justice system is slow, and so far no major
political figure _ on the left or right _ has been convicted or
lost office as a result of the investigations under way.
	   Desmure is looking into the period from 1988-1993 when Juppe was
finance director for the city of Paris. In addition to misuse of
public funds, Juppe is under investigation for ``illegal personal
benefit'' and fraud.
	   It could be months _ if not years _ before Juppe, now mayor of
Bordeaux, is either formally charged or the investigation is
dropped.
	   During the period under investigation, Chirac was Paris mayor,
and Juppe's boss.
	   Philippe Seguin, president of the Rally for the Republic party,
immediately issued a communique expressing ``his solidarity, his
support and his entire confidence'' in Juppe.
	   Also placed under investigation Tuesday was Michel Roussin,
Chirac's former chief assistant while he was mayor.
	   The Paris mayor's office has been a hotbed of scandal for years.
	   In May, police detained the wife of Jean Tiberi, the current
mayor, for questioning about a payment she received for writing a
report commissioned by one of her husband's political allies.
	   Juppe also has been touched by scandal in the past. While prime
minister, he was undermined by revelations that he used city funds
to renovate his apartment, also in the early 1990s.
	   His son was found to be living in a city-owned apartment for
very low rent. Both were forced to move after a public outcry in
1995.
	   Juppe resigned as prime minister in 1997 after the conservatives
were badly defeated by the left in parliamentary elections.

Japan's LTCB announces bad debts; Obuchi defends bailout
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS for AMs; ADDS new quote from Miyazawa in graf 3
 &UR; By TODD ZAUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's government defended
its bailout plan for the ailing Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd.
on Tuesday, saying the rescue is necessary to protect the stability
of the nation's financial system.
	   Opposition party politicians lambasted Obuchi and his ruling
party over plans to use public funds to dispose of some of the
bank's bad loans.
	   But Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the plan was necessary
because the failure of such a big bank ``would have an impact not
only on the Japanese economy, but also on confidence in Japan.''
	   To head off accusations that public funds would be a temporary
crutch for a hopelessly insolvent lender, the LTCB took the
unprecedented step of disclosing the results of an in-house audit
of its loans.
	   The bank, Japan's tenth biggest by asset size, said about 15
percent of its loans were ``likely to go bad'' or ``required
monitoring.'' That's higher than the industry average of about 11
percent.
	   Japanese banks have been widely criticized for trying to cover
up the extent of their bad loan problems.
	   Long-Term Credit Bank last week announced a major restructuring
plan and asked for public funds to help write off some 750 billion
yen (dlrs 5.3 billion) in problem debt.
	   The plan has met harsh criticism by opposition politicians who
have called for more thorough disclosure of the bank's financial
condition and criminal prosecution of those found guilty of
mismanagement.
	   Eijiro Hata, a senior politician in the main opposition
Democratic Party, said there was no proof LTCB was solvent, and it
was therefore improper to spend government money on it.
	   ``The government needs to clearly explain to the public why LTCB
needs public money,'' he said, accusing the government of trying to
prop up defunct banks.
	   Obuchi stood behind the government-backed rescue plan.
	   He told Parliament that a Bank of Japan study and LTCB's
internal assessment showed that it was solvent as of the fiscal
year-end last March 31.
	   He said the public money for LTCB wasn't intended just to
protect an individual bank from failing, but to preserve the
stability of the overall financial system.
	   The ruling party's General Council Chairman, Takashi Fukaya, on
Tuesday demanded that retiring LTCB officials forfeit retirement
bonuses, saying the bank shouldn't offer big benefits to executives
while receiving a public bailout.
	   The bank has already said it would ask retiring executives to
voluntarily give up some of their benefits.
	   Announcing the results of its own loan audit, LTCB said it had
15.91 trillion yen (dlrs 110.5 billion) of ``sound'' loans at the
end of last fiscal year on March 31, 2.38 trillion yen (dlrs 16.5
billion) in loans that ``require monitoring,'' and 444.4 billion
yen (dlrs 3.1 billion) in loans which were ``likely to go bad.''
	   It said it had no bad loans as of March 31, after making massive
write-offs.
	   The Financial Supervisory Agency, Japan's bank watchdog, is also
inspecting LTCB's books and may come up with different figures,
although it has already expressed support for the rescue merger.

Tensions increase on Latvian citizenship referendum
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) _ The OSCE's commissioner for national
minorities Max van der Stoel on Tuesday cautioned Latvians to make
sure they understand the potential long-term effects of opposing
moves to make it easier for ethnic Russians to become citizens.
	   He made the statement in the wake of nationalist politicians'
apparent success in trying to force a referendum on parliament's
passage of liberalized naturalization laws in June. The changes
were passed amid threats of sanctions by Russia.
	   ``I hope the Latvian people will comprehend what these
amendments imply and what they don't imply,'' van der Stoel said
after meeting with President Guntis Ulmanis, according to the
Baltic News Service.
	   The Central Electoral Commission is expected to rule by Friday
on whether the nationalists' petition drive collected enough valid
signatures for a plebiscite.
	   Russia this spring threatened economic sanctions against its
diminutive neighbor unless it improved conditions for its
approximately 700,000 ethnic Russians, most of whom became
stateless after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
	   The sanctions threat was accompanied by harsh statements from
some Russian politicians, such as Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov who
accused Latvia of ``genocide.'' Some Russian stores stopped selling
Latvian goods in protest.
	   The issue had long been an irritant between Russia and Latvia,
and the dramatic escalation of tensions this spring gave new
impetus to Latvian politicians such as Ulmanis who supported
changing the laws.
	   ``One of the most important questions at the present moment is
to achieve that the citizenship law is accepted,'' Ulmanis was
quoted by BNS as saying.
	   The proposed changes would eliminate the ``windows'' system,
under which older non-citizens have to wait longer than younger
ones to apply for citizenship.
	   Many saw that provision as an obvious move to punish ethnic
Russians who moved to Latvia in great waves under Josef Stalin's
``russification'' program.
	   The proposed changes also would grant citizenship to all
children born in the country since independence, regardless of
whether their parents are citizens.
	   Many Latvian politicians are concerned that failing to change
the citizenship laws will make their struggling country lose
prestige and hinder its efforts to join the European Union.
	   But nationalists, who resent the Russian presence in Latvia and
who often complain that ethnic Latvians make up less than 60
percent of the country, have strong support. Prime Minister Guntars
Krasts was among the signers of the petition calling for the
referendum.

Marsh and McLennan launches takeover bid for Sedgwick

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Marsh and McLennan Cos. Inc., a U.S.
based-insurance giant, launched a bid Tuesday to take over Sedgwick
Group PLC, a deal that would create the world's largest insurance
broker.
	   Marsh and McLennan bid 1.25 billion pounds (dlrs 2.05 billion)
for British-based Sedgwick.
	   The bid price _ 2.25 pounds (dlrs 3.69) a share _ was 58 percent
above Sedgwick's closing share price Monday of 1.42 pounds (dlrs.
2.33).
	   Kevin Ryan, an analyst at Nikko Europe, said Sedgwick has assets
of about 200 million pounds (dlrs 328 million), so New York-based
Marsh and McLennan would be paying more than 1 billion pounds (dlrs
1.6 billion) in ``goodwill.''
	   ``That makes this deal pretty risky,'' he said.
	   The merger comes in the middle of consolidation moves throughout
the insurance industry. Willis Corron Group PLC, another British
insurance giant, announced last month that it was being taken over
by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, a U.S. buyout specialist.
	   European regulators must now clear the merger.
	   In its announcement Tuesday, Marsh and McLennan said it expected
the deal to boost earnings in 2000.
	   Sedgwick employs 16,000 people worldwide. Marsh and McLennan has
36,000 employees.

Dutch powerhouse plagued by injuries before must-win match
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN PYE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Dutch soccer giant PSV Eindhoven has been struck
by injury problems as it prepares for its decisive second-leg match
against Slovenian side Maribor in qualifying for the European
Champions League.
	   The Dutch league runner-up suffered a shock 2-1 loser in the
first leg of the second-round qualifier in Slovenia two weeks ago
and must win at home to keep its European campaign alive.
	   Eindhoven coach Bobby Robson needs to reinforce a defensive line
weakened by the expected absence of Dutch international Stan Valckx
and Ukrainian Yuri Nikiforov, who are both carrying knee injuries.
	   Maribor supporters have billed the match as the club's most
important challenge to date.
	   The result is considered so important that even Maribor mayor
Alojz Krizman is travelling to the Netherlands with the team.
	   Maribor coach Bojan Prasnikar said his team had a real chance of
upsetting one of Europe's biggest teams.
	   ``Maribor will have to play against all of them, because in
Europe it's not in the interest of anyone that our team would
continue in the elite Champions League,'' Prasnikar said Tuesday.
	   Inter Milan's star Brazilian striker Ronaldo is back in Italy
after a post-World Cup vacation but is not playing against Skonto
Riga in the return match in Latvia.
	   Inter has a commanding 4-0 lead after Italian star Roberto
Baggio scored one goal and set up three others in his debut for the
club two weeks ago.
	   Inter coach Luigi Simoni now has the luxury of experimenting
with line-up changes, and could pair Baggio and French World Cup
player Youri Djorkaeff behind lone forward Ivan Zamorano.
	   Skonto, which rated the first-leg match against the Italian
powerhouse as the most important sporting event in Latvia's recent
history, will be without captain Vitalijs Astafjevs, who was
injured in the last match.
	   Manchester United's new 12.6 million (dlrs 20.5 million)
signing, Dwight Yorke, should be eligible for the return clash with
LKS Lodz in Poland.
	   The English Premier League giant, which has a 2-0 advantage
after the first match at Old Trafford, signed the Tobagan striker
from Aston Villa before the European deadline last week.
	   Yorke said the major reason for his transfer was to prove his
skill in the Champions League.
	   United will go into the Lodz match without defender Gary
Neville, who injured a hamstring in a league match on Saturday. His
place is likely to go to his younger brother, Philip Neville.
	   Czech international goalkeeper Tomas Postulka has been given a
show of faith by Sparta Prague coach Zdenek Scasny for the return
match against Dynamo Kiev.
	   Postulka kept the Ukranians goal-less in Sparta's 1-0 first-leg
win at Kiev but had a disastrous league match last week, conceding
four goals to Drnovice.
	   Metz, runner-up in the French championship last season, needs to
overturn a 1-0 first-leg deficit against HJK Helsinki to qualify
for the Champions League.
	   But last season's leading goal-scorer Bruno Rodriguez is injured
and is not expected to be fit for Wednesday's match. In his
absence, Metz has lost two of its first three games and not managed
to score a goal.
	   Steaua Bucharest had a 2-2 tie with Panathinaikos in the first
leg and travels to Athens for its must-win game without the
services of Ilie Dumitrescu and injury clouds over Cristian Ciocoiu
and Damian Militaru.
	   Panathinaikos coach Vassilis Daniel reported no injury problems
and said his team would not settle for a draw.
	   ``The 2-2 first leg result was good but we'll play only for a
victory,'' he said.
	   Galatasary striker Hakan Sukur and playmaker Gheoghe Hagi are
ready to attack when the Turkish side travels to Zurich to defend
its 2-1 lead over Grasshoppers.
	   Grasshoppers' sports director Erich Vogel said the match was
``the game of the decade'' for the Swiss team.
	   ``If you want to play a role in Europe's soccer future, you have
to be in (the Champions League).''
	   Scottish league titlist Celtic will be defending a narrow 1-0
advantage when it travels to play Croatia Zagreb.
	   Zagreb coach Zlatko Kranjcar said he was gambling on sticking
with the 11 players which lost to Celtic in Glasgow two weeks ago
as he heads into the ``the most important game of my career.''
	   ``If they score the first goal, that would kill us
psychologically. So, the most important thing for us is to score
first,'' he said.
	   In other games, Bayern Munich has a 4-0 advantage going into the
second leg match against Yugoslavian titlist Obilic.

Interior minister says gov't won't foot Papon's legal bills
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The French government has refused to pay the legal
fines of Maurice Papon, the former Vichy official convicted of
crimes against humanity for his role in sending Jews to their
deaths during World War II.
	   In a letter addressed to Papon's lawyer excerpted in Tuesday's
Le Monde, French Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement said the
government couldn't be responsible for the financial consequences
of ``acts that clearly resulted from a personal mistake.''
	   Papon, 87, was sentenced to 10 years in prison, but remains free
during an appeals process that could take years. He is the
highest-ranking Vichy official to be convicted of crimes against
humanity.
	   A former budget minister and Paris police chief, Papon was also
ordered to pay 4.6 million francs (dlrs 767,00) in damages to civil
parties, as well as legal fees.
	   After the April 2 verdict, Varaut appealed to Chevenement to pay
the fees. He argued that ``the acts of which Papon is accused
cannot be dissociated from his job'' as the No. 2 man in the
Bordeaux regional prefecture from 1942-44.
	   During the six-month trial _ the longest in France's postwar
history _ Varaut argued that Papon was following orders from
superiors.
	   Chevenement called Papon's demand ``inappropriate and a
provocation.''
	   Papon was found guilty of complicity in crimes against humanity
for arresting and deporting nearly 1,600 Jews, including 233
children, from Bordeaux.

Serbs accused of killing three charity workers in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with charity confirming deaths, UNHCR convoy, more
details &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police, on the offensive in
Kosovo, were accused Tuesday of killing three ethnic Albanian
charity workers who were taking humanitarian aid to refugees.
	   The report came amid a storm of new international criticism of
the Serbs for their attacks in secessionist Kosovo.
	   The Mother Teresa humanitarian organization said the three were
killed Monday after police allowed them to pass through a
checkpoint near Malisevo, a former rebel stronghold in central
Kosovo that Serb forces overran last month.
	   Palok Berishaj, secretary of the aid organization, said police
subsequently shelled the tractor they were riding on to take aid
into the region, one of the most densely refugee-populated in the
war-torn province of southern Serbia.
	   The charity, based in Kosovo, is responsible for the bulk of
humanitarian assistance to the province, distributing such items as
wheat flour and soap. It is not affiliated with the Sisters of
Charity, Mother Teresa's India-based missionary order.
	   The Pristina daily Koha Ditore and the Albanians' Kosovo
Information Center gave similar accounts.
	   As U.S. envoy Christopher Hill prepared to meet in Belgrade with
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, there were new reports of
fighting and more condemnation of the Serbs.
	   Serbian police and the Yugoslav army continued shelling several
villages southwest of Pristina in their drive to crush separatist
resistance among Kosovo's majority ethnic Albanians.
	   According to the Kosovo Information Center, after killing three
ethnic Albanians in clashes Monday the Serbs were targeting seven
villages in the Suva Reka region on Tuesday and were setting ablaze
houses after dousing them with gasoline.
	   ``We denounce the continuing violence in Kosovo which is forcing
more people to flee,'' spokesman Kris Janowski of the UNHCR said
Tuesday in Geneva. ``The situation is getting worse and worse.''
	   He said the U.N. agency is planning to double its staff in
Pristina to around 14 but has been hindered by delays in obtaining
visas from Belgrade authorities.
	   UNHCR sent a 10-truck convoy Tuesday to refugees in the Baranski
Do region 60 kilometers (35 miles) west of Pristina, carrying food,
medicine, clothes and blankets. Humanitarian agencies estimate that
as many as 50,000 refugees in Kosovo are living in the open.

Austeria, like Germany, may face compensation claims
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROLAND PRINZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Like Germany, Austria may face
compensation claims from Holocaust survivors who worked as slave
laborers for Austrian companies during Nazi rule.
	   No such claims are known to have been made in the recent past
against Austrian companies. But German firms have been requested to
make such payments, and some of them have refused.
	   Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal recalled Tuesday he had sought
compensation for Holocaust survivors as early as 1946 but was
turned down by those Austrian enterprises who had used wartime
slave labor.
	   About 7 million slave laborers were forced to work in Nazi
Germany. The German government has compensated survivors for
imprisonment and health damage, but has refused to honor wage
claims, saying laborers worked for private companies.
	   In Austria, where up to 700,000 slave laborers were employed
during the war, no such payments have been made to date.
	   Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany in 1938 and vanished from
the political landscape for seven years.
	   After the end of World War II, Austrian leaders gladly invoked
the so-called Moscow Declaration of 1943, in which the wartime
allies declared Austria the first victim of Nazi dictator Adolf
Hitler's fascist rule.
	   However, Austrians accounted for a disproportionately high
number of people involved in the Nazi death machine, including
members of the dreaded SS, the elite of the German armed forces.
	   Slave labor is only one of several Nazi-era issues which
successive Austrian governments failed to address. In a recent
series of articles on Nazi seizure and employment practices, the
Austria Press Agency quoted postwar Interior Minister Oskar Helmer
as saying he was in favor ``of dragging things out'' rather than
compensating victims.
	   U.S. attorney Edward Fagan is planning to meet executives of
Creditanstalt bank to discuss ways of compensating Holocaust
survivors whose gold was stolen by the Nazis and allegedly
transferred by the bank to Turkey during the war.
	   He has waived, for the time being, a class action lawsuit
against the Vienna bank.
	   Chancellor Viktor Klima was reported by Austrian media to have
recommended to Creditanstalt executives to be cooperative in
dealing with the compensation claims.
	   Both he and Vice Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessels suggested that
Austrian companies should react ``with the greatest possible
openness'' to claims from victims of Nazi terror.
	   Other issues still unresolved 53 years after the collapse of
Nazi rule include compensation for those whose companies were
``Aryanized'' by the Nazis and in some cases nationalized by the
Austrian government after the war.
	   In a statement Tuesday, Wiesenthal said he first raised the
compensation issue in 1946 when he served as president of the
Jewish Central Committee for the American occupation zone in
Austria.
	   He said people who authorized him to make the claims were then
infirm workers forced to work in the Hermann Goering Werke, which
after the war became the nationalized VOEST-Alpine iron and steel
concern.
	   A year after the end of the war, Wiesenthal wrote letters to
VOEST Alpine, Steyr-Daimler-Puch, an engineering enterprise that
produced weapons for the Nazi army, as well as a construction
enterprise and a large papermill.
	   He asked those companies to make payments for work done by those
forced to work for them as concentration camp inmates or as other
slave laborers.
	   ``The answers were all negative, with the most varying arguments
in favor of rejection being advanced,'' he said.
	   VOEST Alpine reportedly told him that for providing
concentration camp inmates, the company paid fixed daily rates on a
monthly basis to the camp management. In addition, the company
said, it also paid for accommodation, the canteen and other things.
	   According to Wiesenthal, company managers even claimed that, all
things considered, ``the use of concentration camp inmates was
financially more expensive for the company and building enterprises
than `civilian' workers ...''

Hosey hits home run as Swallows beat Hiroshima 3-1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Dwayne Hosey, formerly of the Boston Red Sox,
belted out a two-run home run in the eighth inning to lead the
Yakult Swallows to a 3-1 win over the Hiroshima Carp Tuesday.
	   Tetsuya Kitagawa took the win, helping the Swallows shore up
their fourth-place ranking in Japanese professional baseball's
Central League.
	   Chunichi Dragons relief ace Sun Dong-yol of South Korea came
through with a flawless closer in Nagoya, helping secure the
Dragons 3-2 victory over the Yomiuri Giants in an error-plagued
game.
	   The outing put Chunichi at 60 wins, making it the first team so
far this season to achieve that mark.
	   In other Central League action, the Yokohama BayStars gave a
14-1 shellacking to the Hanshin Tigers at Koshien Stadium in
western Japan's Hyogo prefecture. The BayStars racked up 18 hits to
clinch their first win in three games.
	   Separately, Yokohama said Tuesday that starting pitcher Daisuke
Miura, 24, has been taken off the team's active roster because of a
liver ailment, Kyodo News reported.
	   The Pacific League-leading Nippon Ham Fighters chalked up
another win with a 1-0 victory at Tokyo Dome over the bottom-ranked
Chiba Lotte Marines.
	   Former Cleveland Indian Nigel Wilson smacked a double in the
eight inning which drove home the Fighters' lone run.
	   Elsewhere, Domingo Martinez, formerly a Triple-A player in
Rochester, hit one of two 11th-inning home runs which powered the
Seibu Lions to a 12-6 win over the Kintetsu Buffaloes in Osaka.
	   The Daiei Hawks suffered their first setback in five games as
the Orix BlueWave took a 5-2 win in Fukuoka.

Italians at ferry dock seize arms on truck headed to Albania
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANCONA, Italy (AP) _ Italian police in this Adriatic port city
said Tuesday they have seized a truck packed with arms apparently
headed to Kosovo via Albania.
	   The Croatian driver was arrested on charges of arm trafficking,
police said. The man was not identified.
	   The truck, crossing the Adriatic to Ancona Monday aboard a ferry
from Split, Croatia, was supposed to continue to Durres, in
Albania, later that day via another ferry.
	   Police said they searched the truck before it was to be loaded
on the ferry for the trip back across the Adriatic. Hidden under
blankets and boxes filled with expired medicine were more than 50
weapons, including rifles, bazookas and mortars, and approximately
60 boxes full of ammunition, hand grenades and anti-tank grenades.
	   Investigators believe the arms were coming from Bosnia and
ultimatedly headed to the embattled Serb province of Kosovo.
	   The truck's manifest said it was carrying potatoes.
	   Police have stepped up controls in Ancona, one of the busiest
ports on the Italian Adriatic, after another truck full of weapons
reached Durres in June following a four-hour stopover in Ancona.
The arms were then confiscated in Albania.

Settlers stone Palestinian passers-by in fresh Hebron clashes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with settlers throwing stones at Palestinian
passers-by after Israeli troops lift curfew in downtown area &QL; 
 &UR; By NASSER SHIYOUKHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank, (AP) _ Jewish settlers seeking revenge for
the killing of a rabbi pushed and stoned Palestinian passers-by
Tuesday after Israeli troops briefly lifted a curfew in the center
of this tense Palestinian city.
	   Israeli soldiers detained a woman settler outside the Jewish
enclave of Beit Hadassah and escorted Palestinian pedestrians to
safey while trying to push back about 30 settlers.
	   ``Go home, go home,'' settlers shouted as Palestinians tried to
make their way past Beit Hadassah.
	   Israel had imposed a curfew on 30,000 Palestinians in the
downtown area of Hebron last Friday, following the killing of a
prominent settler rabbi who Israeli police say was stabbed to death
by a Palestinian.
	   The violence came at a time when Israel and the Palestinians
reportedly softened their positions on an Israeli troop withdrawal
in the West Bank after a 17-month stalemate.
	   Still, both sides said Tuesday that several issues remained
unresolved, and the progress made in recent days apparently was not
sufficient to persuade U.S. Mideast peace envoy Dennis Ross to
return to the region to try and finalize a deal.
	   Earlier Tuesday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu paid a
surprise visit to the Hebron settlers and promised to expand the
Jewish enclaves in the city of 450 settlers and 130,000
Palestinians. ``I care. I want them (settlers) to have security and
permanency and expansion and they deserve it,'' Netanyahu said.
	   Netanyahu's gesture was aimed at his hardline critics, including
many settler leaders, who have demanded that Israel break off
negotiations with the Palestinians following the killing of a
well-known Hebron rabbi, apparently by a Palestinian, last week.
	   Netanyahu said proposals to build permanent housing in the
Jewish enclave of Tel Romeida, a small trailer park where the rabbi
was killed last week, were submitted for approval Tuesday.
	   Netanyahu also approved the construction of an apartment
building for settlers next to Beit Hadassah, the Yediot Ahronot
daily said. Land next to Beit Hadassah was recently cleared for
construction.
	   Finance Minister Yaakov Neeman, meanwhile, has set aside 10
million shekels (dlrs 2.7 million) for Tel Romeida construction,
and on Monday parliament's Finance Ministry approved an additional
90 million shekels (dlrs 24.2 million) for settlement expansion
throughout the West Bank.
	   The United States offered a proposal in January for an Israeli
withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank, in exchange for
Palestinian security gestures. The Palestinians accepted the
proposal but Israel did not and the sides have been haggling since.
	   On Monday, Arafat said new Israeli ideas submitted in recent
days were ``a beginning'' and that he would accept an Israeli
formula to turn part of the land slated for withdrawal into a
nature reserve where Palestinians would not be allowed to settle.
	   However, Palestinian Information Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo said
Tuesday the Palestinians sought clarifications about the extent of
control the Palestinians would have over the nature reserve.
	   Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh also said sticking points
remained and denied reports that Israel had dropped a major demand
_ its insistence that the 545-member Palestine National Council
convene to amend the PLO charter calling for Israel's destruction.
	   ``Israel is definitely not bending. There won't be an agreement
until all components are accepted,'' Naveh told Israel radio.
	   Palestinians have maintained the PNC already took action to
revoke the charter.
	   A senior Israeli official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said that Israel told U.S. negotiators that it would now agree to
start the withdrawal process if the Palestinians promised to change
the charter within four months of phased pullbacks.
	   Israeli radio also reported that CIA representatives and
Palestinian security officials have begun drawing up a new security
memorandum on fighting terrorism.
	   Israel has said that no deal could be completed unless they
received assurances from the Palestinian Authority on combating
militants.
	   Officials were hoping a deal could be wrapped up before Sept.
13, the anniversary of the historic Israeli-Palestinian peace
accords first signed five years ago, the Haaretz daily said.

Researcher wants financial support in return for diary pages
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES throughout with new details of dispute,
researcher seeking financial support for his work, former colleague
defending him. &QL; 
 &UR; By WILLIAM J. KOLE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ In the dry and dignified realm of
World War II research, it's the closest thing to a hostage
standoff.
	   Threatening what could be interpreted as academic blackmail, a
leading Anne Frank expert who's been holding five missing pages of
her famed diary for 18 years has agreed to turn them over. But
there's a big ``if'' _ he wants the proceeds from their publication
to financially support his own Holocaust research in the United
States.
	   The Netherlands State Institute for War Documentation, which
revealed the existence of the missing pages last week, expressed
astonishment Tuesday at the televised demands from former Anne
Frank Foundation employee Cornelis Suijk.
	   ``We've asked a lawyer to try to find a way out of this,'' said
David Barnouw, spokesman for the war documentation center.
	   ``I'm a little surprised,'' he added.
	   Suijk claims that Otto Frank, father of the young Jewish diarist
whose harrowing account of hiding from the Nazis has become an
international best-seller in 55 languages, gave him the pages
shortly before his death in 1980.
	   Suijk, 74, a longtime Anne Frank Foundation financial adviser
and close personal friend and confidante of Otto Frank, told RTL4
television Monday evening that the elder Frank made him promise the
pages wouldn't be published until the entire family was dead.
	   Suijk told the station he's the ``rightful owner'' of the pages
and that he's willing to part with them only if the war
documentation institute in turn agrees to use the proceeds from
their publication to support his own research.
	   The institute, which wants the pages back so they can be
included in the next edition of ``The Diary of Anne Frank,''
contends that Otto Frank never intended to make a gift of them to
Suijk.
	   Suijk, now international director of the New York-based Anne
Frank Center USA, a sister organization of the Amsterdam
foundation, did not immediately return phone calls seeking comment
Tuesday.
	   Former colleagues, meanwhile, defended both Suijk and his
scholarship.
	   ``He is beyond a shadow of a doubt a man of integrity,'' Gerrold
van der Stroom, a co-editor of ``The Diary of Anne Frank _ The
Critical Edition,'' told the daily De Volkskrant.
	   The war documentation center, citing the diary copyright held by
the Basel, Switzerland-based Anne Frank Fund, has said only that
the handwritten pages appear to be authentic and contain Anne's
``very critical'' assessment of her parents' marriage.
	   Suijk, however, said their contents will be revealed Sept. 14 in
Dutch documentary about Anne's two years in hiding in a secret
annex behind a movable bookcase in an Amsterdam canal house.
	   The revelation that there are pages missing from Anne's diary
has startled scholars who have spent decades researching her life
and were convinced they'd published the complete journal.
	   It trails off in August 1944, just before the Franks were
betrayed and Anne was arrested and hauled off to the Bergen-Belsen
concentration camp. Starving and freezing, Anne died there of
typhoid in the spring of 1945, just weeks before the camp was
liberated.
	   Her diary, a modern literary classic that has become required
reading in schools worldwide, has inspired numerous books, films
and a hit Broadway play.

Nigeria to hold presidential vote Feb. 27, 1999

in state/national voting. CORRECTS in penultimate graf that Abacha
did not annul 1993 elections. No pickup. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria's long-awaited presidential
elections will be held on Feb. 27, 1999, in line with promises from
military leaders to hand over power to civilians next May, the
electoral commission announced Tuesday.
	   Elections for the national assembly in Africa's most populous
country will be held one week earlier, on Feb. 20, the Independent
National Electoral Commission said in a statement.
	   Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, who came to power in early June after
the sudden death of the former dictator, Gen. Sani Abacha, said
last month that Nigeria would hold presidential elections in the
first quarter of 1999, and turn power over to a civilian government
in May.
	   Local government council elections will be held on Dec. 5 of
this year and voting for state assemblies and governors will be on
Jan. 9, 1999, the commission said.
	   All political party will be able to field candidates in the
local elections, but only parties that score at least 10 percent of
the vote in at least 24 of Nigeria's 36 states will be able to run
candidates in the state and national voting.
	   The president will be sworn in on May 29.
	   Electoral commission rules forbid members of the armed forces
and police from joining political parties.
	   The voting is being highly anticipated in Nigeria, where
Abacha's death has brought about a sudden shift in the country's
political landscape.
	   Abubakar, while still widely viewed with suspicion by Nigeria's
political opposition, quickly set about moving Nigeria on a
different course from his predecessor, whose brutal and corrupt
rule left Nigeria crippled. He freed political prisoners, met with
international envoys and has repeatedly vowed to allow a return to
civilian rule in Nigeria, which has been ruled by military
governments for all but 10 years since achieving independence from
Britain in 1960.
	   The last presidential elections, held in 1993, were annulled by
the military government. Abacha imprisoned the apparent winner,
millionaire businessman Moshood Abiola, one year later.
	   Abiola died in prison in July, just before Abubakar was to have
freed him.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police, on the offensive in
Kosovo, were accused Tuesday of killing three ethnic Albanian
charity workers who were taking humanitarian aid to refugees.
	   The report came amid a storm of new international criticism of
the Serbs for their attacks in secessionist Kosovo.
	   The Mother Teresa humanitarian organization said the three were
killed Monday after police allowed them to pass through a
checkpoint near Malisevo, a former rebel stronghold in central
Kosovo that Serb forces overran last month.
	   Palok Berishaj, secretary of the aid organization, said
apparently a shell hit the tractor they were riding on to take aid
into the region, one of the most densely refugee-populated in the
war-torn province of southern Serbia. The ethnic Albanian daily
Koha Ditore cited witnesses Tuesday as saying that police fired the
shell.

Diplomat appeals for help to release three kidnapped tourists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ The New Zealand High Commissioner to
South Africa has appealed to authorities in Uganda, Rwanda and
Congo for help in obtaining the release of three tourists,
including a New Zealander, who are being held by Rwandan Hutu
rebels, a newspaper said Tuesday.
	   The government-owned New Vision said Brian Absolum was in
Kampala to seek the release of Douglas John Hear, 66, of Hamilton,
New Zealand, as well as of Swedes Ann Charlotte Jorisson and Jens
Olsson.
	   The three, together with a Canadian woman identified as Joan
Donaldo Reid, were grabbed by August 12 inside Congo where they had
trekked from neighboring Uganda to observe rare mountain gorillas.
	   ``There is a lot of anxiety about the missing people. We request
the authorities to put in more effort in the search for the
three,'' said Absolum, who acknowledged that it was difficult to
locate the trio and their abductors in the densely forestest area
that is home to the gorillas.
	   Donaldo Reid and seven Congolese guides and porters were
released Monday by a group calling itself PALIR (People in Action
for the Liberation of Rwanda) in exchange for releasing a statement
on what the group called its ``noble objectives.''
	   PALIR first made itself known in June 1996 when it placed
bounties on the heads of the U.S. ambassador in Rwanda and any
other American living there.
	   The Hutu rebels are believed to be remanants of the former
Rwandan Hutu army and the Interahamwe militia responsible for
carrying out the government-orchestrated slaughter of at least half
a million minority Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus between
April and July 1994.
	   When Tutsi rebels overthrew the government and ended the
killing, the army and militia escaped into neighboring Congo.
	   The most recent incident involving the group occurred in June
when it warned of more attacks inside Rwanda as part of its
campaign to oust what it called ``Tutsi occupiers and their
allies.''

Bahraini business tycoon Abdulrahman Almoayyed dead at 84
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ Abdulrahman Khalil Almoayyed, a Bahraini
businessman who expanded his father's pearl business into a
multinational empire with stakes in shipping, steel, oil and
construction, has died, his family said Tuesday.
	   Almoayyed died Monday of a heart attack. He was 84.
	   Almoayyed, who was born in Manama, Bahrain's capital, joined his
family's pearl business in the 1920s. In the 1930s, when oil was
discovered on the island nation, he expanded the company into a
regional empire with interests throughout the Gulf.
	   He set up many joint-ventures, including the Almoayyed Barwil
shipping company in association with the top Norwegian shipping
family, Wilhemson.
	   Almoayyed also served as a member of the board of the island's
central bank, the Bahrain Monetary Agency.
	   His family declined to discuss Almoayyed's holdings, but they
are believed to run into the millions of dollars. A son, Tawfiq,
described Almoayyed as ``a very hard working man who kept a low
profile and avoided publicity.''
	   Almoayyed is survived by his wife, Amina, two daughters and four
sons, including the former Information Minister Tariq Almoayyed.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin
suggested Tuesday that the Communist-led opposition in the Russian
parliament could get seats in his new Cabinet.
	   Chernomyrdin, who huddled with his political supporters in
parliament on Tuesday, said the new Cabinet should be a so-called
``government of accord.'' The statement signaled that President
Boris Yeltsin might overcome his disdain for his parliamentary foes
and reach a compromise with them in order to seal Chernomyrdin's
confirmation as prime minister.
	   Yeltsin spoke for more than an hour with President Bill Clinton
on Tuesday, but the Interfax news agency said their conversation
focused on preparations for their summit meeting next week.

Tensions increase on Latvian citizenship referendum
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS top two grafs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) _ A top European human rights official on
Tuesday cautioned Latvians to consider the long-term consequences
of rejecting the liberalized citizenship laws that were passed amid
Russian sanctions threats.
	   Max van der Stoel, the OSCE's commission for national
minorities, made the statement in the wake of nationalist
politicians' apparent success in trying to force a referendum on
the liberalizing amendments passed by Parliament in June.
	   ``I hope the Latvian people will comprehend what these
amendments imply and what they don't imply,'' van der Stoel said
after meeting with President Guntis Ulmanis, according to the
Baltic News Service.
	   The Central Electoral Commission is expected to rule by Friday
on whether the nationalists' petition drive collected enough valid
signatures for a plebiscite.
	   Russia this spring threatened economic sanctions against its
diminutive neighbor unless it improved conditions for its
approximately 700,000 ethnic Russians, most of whom became
stateless after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
	   The sanctions threat was accompanied by harsh statements from
some Russian politicians, such as Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov who
accused Latvia of ``genocide.'' Some Russian stores stopped selling
Latvian goods in protest.
	   The issue had long been an irritant between Russia and Latvia,
and the dramatic escalation of tensions this spring gave new
impetus to Latvian politicians such as Ulmanis who supported
changing the laws.
	   ``One of the most important questions at the present moment is
to achieve that the citizenship law is accepted,'' Ulmanis was
quoted by BNS as saying.
	   The proposed changes would eliminate the ``windows'' system,
under which older non-citizens have to wait longer than younger
ones to apply for citizenship.
	   Many saw that provision as an obvious move to punish ethnic
Russians who moved to Latvia in great waves under Josef Stalin's
``russification'' program.
	   The proposed changes also would grant citizenship to all
children born in the country since independence, regardless of
whether their parents are citizens.
	   Many Latvian politicians are concerned that failing to change
the citizenship laws will make their struggling country lose
prestige and hinder its efforts to join the European Union.
	   But nationalists, who resent the Russian presence in Latvia and
who often complain that ethnic Latvians make up less than 60
percent of the country, have strong support. Prime Minister Guntars
Krasts was among the signers of the petition calling for the
referendum.

German front-runner wants leading leftist in Cabinet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Opposition candidate Gerhard Schroeder gave
the clearest sign yet that he wants a leading old-style leftist in
his government if the Social Democrats win Germany's Sept. 27
election.
	   Schroeder, the front-runner, has already named Oskar Lafontaine
finance spokesman on his campaign team. In a newspaper interview
Tuesday, he proposed him as a possible government minister.
	   While Schroeder appeals to centrist voters in the bid to unseat
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Lafontaine, who also is party chairman,
stands for the party's left-leaning traditions. His proposals
include reining in the freedom of financial markets.
	   ``I would like to see him in the Cabinet,'' Schroeder was quoted
as saying in an interview with the Rheinische Post daily.
	   Lafontaine said in a TV interview he was interested in the
finance minister's job.
	   But, he told Sat.1 television Tuesday, he had not decided
whether to seek a Cabinet post or the job of the Social Democrats'
parliamentary leader if they win the election.
	   Lafontaine is credited with reviving the once quarrelsome
party's fortunes since taking over as party leader in November
1995.

Advertising executive is remembered in unusual tribute
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ To some it might appear in bad taste,
but to Olimpiu Medar's colleagues it was the perfect way to pay
tribute to a former advertising executive, killed in a car
accident.
	   ``Coffee, cellular telephone, cigarettes, clients, money,
dreams, fast, fast, too fast. And Oli is no longer,'' read the
44-word obituary which appeared Tuesday in the widely read daily
Evenimentul Zilei.
	   At first glance, the obituary looked like a job ad for a local
advertising company.
	   But one of Medar's former colleagues, Anca Mandru, from
Initiative Media Romania advertising company, said by telephone:
``Each member of our creative team wanted to contribute to his
memory in this way.''
	   Evenimentul Zilei defended their decision to print the obituary.
``The client is responsible for the text and image,'' said Marius
Rosu from the paper's advertising department.
	   Medar's obituary and picture appeared near a sex hot-line ad.
Rosu said it was the first time the paper had printed such a
tribute.
	   Medar, 33, died Saturday in a car accident which killed six
people on the Black Sea coast, some 225 kilometers (141 miles) east
of capital. It was the worst accident there this year.

Serbs accused of killing three charity workers in Kosovo

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police, on the offensive in
Kosovo, were accused Tuesday of killing three ethnic Albanian
charity workers who were taking humanitarian aid to refugees.
	   The report came amid a storm of new international criticism of
the Serbs for their attacks in secessionist Kosovo.
	   The Mother Teresa humanitarian organization said the three were
killed Monday after police allowed them to pass through a
checkpoint near Malisevo, a former rebel stronghold in central
Kosovo that Serb forces overran last month.
	   Palok Berishaj, secretary of the aid organization, said police
subsequently shelled the tractor they were riding on to take aid
into the region, one of the most densely refugee-populated in the
southern Serbian province.
	   The charity, based in Kosovo, is responsible for the bulk of
humanitarian assistance to the province, distributing such items as
wheat flour and soap. It is not affiliated with the Missionaries of
Charity, Mother Teresa's India-based Roman Catholic order.
	   The Pristina daily Koha Ditore and the Albanians' Kosovo
Information Center gave similar accounts.
	   As U.S. envoy Christopher Hill prepared to meet in Belgrade with
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, there were new reports of
fighting and more condemnation of the Serbs.
	   Serbian police and the Yugoslav army continued shelling several
villages southwest of Pristina in their drive to crush separatist
resistance among Kosovo's majority ethnic Albanians.
	   According to the Kosovo Information Center, after killing three
ethnic Albanians in clashes Monday the Serbs were targeting seven
villages in the Suva Reka region on Tuesday and were setting ablaze
houses after dousing them with gasoline.
	   ``We denounce the continuing violence in Kosovo which is forcing
more people to flee,'' spokesman Kris Janowski of the UNHCR said
Tuesday in Geneva. ``The situation is getting worse and worse.''
	   He said the U.N. agency is planning to double its staff in
Pristina to around 14 but has been hindered by delays in obtaining
visas from Belgrade authorities.
	   UNHCR sent a 10-truck convoy Tuesday to refugees in the Baranski
Do region 60 kilometers (35 miles) west of Pristina, carrying food,
medicine, clothes and blankets. Humanitarian agencies estimate that
as many as 50,000 refugees in Kosovo are living in the open.

Libya expected to accept decision to try Libyan suspects
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SALAH NASRAWI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libya is expected to accept a U.S.-British
agreement to try two Libyan suspects in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am
Flight 103 in The Netherlands, the head of the Arab League said
Tuesday.
	   ``The American-British proposal is compatible with the previous
Arab suggestions, which Libya has accepted,'' Esmat Abdel Meguid
said in a statement after a meeting with British Ambassador David
Blatherwick.
	   Abdel Meguid said Blatherwick briefed him about the proposals,
which he later conveyed in a letter to Libyan Foreign Minister Omar
al-Muntasser.
	   Under the deal announced Monday, the United States and Britain
agreed to accept a trial by a panel of Scottish judges under
Scottish law in The Hague.
	   The deal also stipulates that the suspects, Abdel Basset
al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, cannot be extradited from The
Netherlands and that if found guilty, they would serve their
sentences in the United Kingdom.
	   Washington and London had long demanded a trial in the United
States or Britain.
	   Libya had insisted that if a trial were held it should be in a
neutral country.
	   The Libyan government has not commented on the offer.
	   A lawyer for the suspects said he has already received
information about the US-British offer.
	   ``We have just received the documents and we are now studying
them carefully,'' Ibrahim Legwell told the Associated Press in a
telephone interview from his Tripoli office.
	   The two men are accused of planting a bomb aboard the flight,
which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people.
	   ``We have a hectic job and a long way to go to ensure a just
trial for the suspects,'' Abdel Meguid said. He declined to give
further information.
	   US and British officials announced the agreement Monday in a bid
to end a 10-year impasse over the bombing
	   The proposal calls for a Scottish court, involving Scottish
judges and lawyers, to sit in The Netherlands.
	   The trial would be held under Scottish law, but the jury would
be replaced by a panel of three Scottish High Court judges.
	   The suspects would have safe passage from Libya to the
Netherlands - and back to Libya if they are acquitted or if the
trial is discontinued, the letter says. U.N. sanctions ban
international flights to and from Libya.

Pakistan officials try to defuse U.S. missile
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS anti-U.S. protest in new graf 11. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Troops cordoned off a patch of
western Pakistani desert Tuesday as experts worked to defuse a U.S.
Tomahawk missile that should have struck neighboring Afghanistan.
	   Pakistan protested Monday to the U.N. Security Council that the
United States had violated its airspace to launch missiles on what
Washington said were terrorist training camps in eastern
Afghanistan. The unexploded missile that landed by accident in
Pakistan was proof of the U.S. violation, Pakistan's foreign
ministry said.
	   Embassy spokesman Richard Hoagland said U.S. officials could not
immediately confirm that a missile had fallen in Pakistan. The
missile reportedly did little damage and caused no injuries.
	   ``It was certainly not our intention to harm Pakistan,''
Hoagland said.
	   Mir Hakim Baloch, the provincial Cabinet minister in charge of
security, said his government first learned of the missile Sunday
from a truck driver who had seen it in Shatinger, a remote area in
Kharan district, some 600 kilometers (375 miles) south of the U.S.
target near Khost, Afghanistan.
	   Bomb disposal teams were brought in, but had not yet defused the
missile Tuesday morning, Baloch said. He said sand bags were placed
around the weapon, residents in a wide area were evacuated and
journalists barred from the spot.
	   An 18-foot (5-meter) Tomahawk is capable of carrying up to 1,000
pounds (450 kilograms) of explosives.
	   The government earlier had had to retract a report that a U.S.
missile that fell during a barrage on Afghanistan last week landed
in Pakistan and killed several people. Pakistan fired its
intelligence chief, Manzoor Ahmed, for passing on the false report
officials said was based on inaccurate information.
	   The United States fired 73 Tomahawk missiles at six targets in a
camp in eastern Afghanistan linked to Saudi dissident Osama bin
Laden. Bin Laden is accused of directing worldwide terror attacks
from Afghanistan, including the Aug. 7 bombings of two U.S.
embassies in East Africa that killed a total of 257 people.
	   The attack on a neighboring, fellow-Muslim country has prompted
daily anti-American protests around Pakistan.
	   In central city of Lahore, more than 600 supporters of the
guerrilla group Harkat-ul-Mujahedeen, some of them armed with
swords and Kalashnikov assault rifles, marched chanting anti-U.S.
slogans. Harkat, declared a terrorist organization by the United
States for sending fighters to join a Muslim uprising in
Indian-held Kashmir, has said several of its members were killed in
the U.S. missile attack on militant training camps in Afghanistan.
	   The government has condemned the simultaneous U.S. attacks on
Afghanistan and on Sudan, where Washington said chemical weapons
were being manufactured for terrorist use.
	   ``While supporting the efforts of the international community to
combat (terrorism), Pakistan takes a serious view of the unilateral
action taken by the United States, involving violation of
Pakistan's air space and use of force against the sovereignty of
the brotherly countries of Afghanistan and Sudan,'' Pakistani
Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz told the Senate on Tuesday.

 &UR; Germany: Russia must stick to its economic reform course &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout with comments from lawmaker, background; ADDS
byline &QL; 
 &UR; By IAN MADER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ While playing down concern that
Russia's financial turmoil might strain Germany's economic upswing,
Germany urged its giant neighbor to the east to stick to its reform
course Tuesday.
	   Ministers in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government promised
continued German support for Russia, which include guarantees on
dlrs 30 billion in private bank loans, to prevent problems there
from getting worse.
	   ``I much prefer a Russia that we accompany into the market
economy to a Russia that stumbles and collapses,'' Economics
Minister Guenter Rexrodt said.
	   The government has insisted that Germany's vulnerability to the
Russian woes is limited even though German banks have by far the
most outstanding loans to Russia.
	   Germany has made Russia's economic development a priority since
the fall of communism, partly to repay it for not blocking German
reunification and partly to take advantage of Germany's proximity
to the emerging markets of the former communist bloc.
	   Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said Germany would stick by Russia
and he urged Moscow to stay the course. ``When it comes to the
reforms, there's no way back, only forward,'' he wrote in Tuesday's
Bild newspaper.
	   But one key lawmaker from Kohl's party sounded a note of alarm
about Russia's financial state and suggested that German support be
contingent on progress there.
	   ``I can't imagine that further substantial help can follow if
Russia doesn't finally'' institute the kind of reforms that boost
foreign confidence in its economy, said Karl-Heinz Hornhues,
ranking lawmaker on parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee.
	   Although German commercial banks have more than dlrs 30 billion
in outstanding loans to Russia, most are guaranteed by the German
government. The banks also have put aside risk provisions of about
60 percent for those not guaranteed.
	   In its monthly report issued Tuesday, the Economics Ministry
said negative effects of Russia's financial crisis on Germany's
economic growth ``will be limited.''
	   However, it described Asia's economic and financial crisis as
``a burdening factor,'' without providing details.
	   Bank analyst Dieter Hein of Commerzbank in Frankfurt noted that
German banks also are the biggest foreign lenders in Asia. But
there, they have put aside far less in risk provision _ only about
10 percent to 20 percent even for stronger Asian nations, he said.
	   The ministry report said higher domestic demand and the European
economic upswing will balance negative effects of both the Russian
and Asian crises.
	   Only a small fraction of Germany's exports go to the countries
affected by those crises, the ministry noted.

United Bank of Switzerland posts rise in net profit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss banking giant United Bank of
Switzerland on Tuesday reported a 22 percent rise in net profit to
3.51 billion Swiss francs (dlrs dlrs 2.34 billion).
	   The figures take into account provisions for the dlrs 1.25
billion class action settlement to Holocaust survivors in the
United States and proceeds from the sale of Banca Della Svizzera
Italiana, which amounted to 1.04 billion francs (dlrs 690 million)
in pre-tax profit.
	   Excluding those items, net profit rose 5 percent to 3.02 billion
francs (dlrs 2.01 billion).
	   UBS said it expects financial results for the second half to be
below those for the first six months.
	   Excluding the BSI sale and provisions for the class action
settlement, UBS expects net profit after tax to rise around 10
percent for the full year 1998 from the consolidated 1997 result of
4.8 billion francs (dlrs 3.2 billion).
	   UBS was formed in June as a result of the merger of two major
Swiss banks, Union Bank of Switzerland and Swiss Bank Corporation.
	   Provisions for the settlement of a U.S. class action suit by
Holocaust victims amount to 544 million francs (dlrs 362.6
million).

Justice minister to reconsider proposed crackdown on broadcasters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece's justice minister Tuesday said he
will reconsider a proposal to expand slander and libel laws to
include a minimum two-year jail term for broadcasting ``slanderous
and insulting matter.''
	   Evangelos Yannopoulos promised reporters he won't submit the
legislation to parliament if Athens's largest press union, or
ESIEA, promises to ``protect innocent people.''
	   ``I do not have the intention to make any legislation as long
the ESIEA board of directors does its duty. As long as the channel
chiefs do their duty,'' he said after meeting with Premier Costas
Simitis.
	   Yannopoulos did not explain what he considered that duty to be.
	   Proposed last week, the legislation was aimed solely at Greek
broadcasting, which has a free-for-all atmosphere, particularly on
private radio and television where some news programs degenerate
into shouting matches with guests trading barbs and accusations.
	   Radio, television journalists and news directors would have been
held liable under the proposal. Yannopoulos presented no guidelines
on what constitutes an insult and what can be deemed legitimate
criticism or satire.
	   Greek media and reporters' unions expressed outrage with the
proposed legislation, while the Austria-based International Press
Institute sent a protest letter to Simitis.
	   Yannopoulos has come under fire in the past for his own acid
tongue. He is popular on television news shows because of the
epithets he often hurls at political opponents.
	   After his meeting with Simitis, he accused reporters of not
fully understanding the controversial legislation.
	   ``None of you read it. I repeat, none of you. Should I then say
that reporters are ill-informed, or should I describe them as
illiterate,'' he said.
	   He then refused to discuss the law unless reporters promised to
write about the other issues he discussed with Simitis.
	   ``Will you write about the other things so that I can tell you
about this?'' he asked. ``Will you give me your word that you'll
write?''

Libya expected to accept decision to try Libyan suspects
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SALAH NASRAWI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libya is expected to accept a U.S.-British
agreement to try two Libyan suspects in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am
Flight 103 in The Netherlands, the head of the Arab League said
Tuesday.
	   ``The American-British proposal is compatible with the previous
Arab suggestions, which Libya has accepted,'' Esmat Abdel Meguid
said in a statement after a meeting with British Ambassador David
Blatherwick.
	   Abdel Meguid said Blatherwick briefed him about the proposals,
which he later conveyed in a letter to Libyan Foreign Minister Omar
al-Muntasser.
	   Under the deal announced Monday, the United States and Britain
agreed to accept a trial of two suspects by a panel of Scottish
judges under Scottish law in The Hague.
	   The two men are accused of planting a bomb aboard the flight,
which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people.
	   The deal also stipulates that the suspects, Abdel Basset
al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, cannot be extradited from The
Netherlands and that if found guilty, they would serve their
sentences in the United Kingdom.
	   Washington and London had long demanded a trial in the United
States or Britain.
	   Libya had insisted that if a trial were held it should be in a
neutral country.
	   The Libyan government has not commented on the offer.
	   A lawyer for the suspects said he has already received
information about the U.S.-British offer.
	   ``We have just received the documents and we are now studying
them carefully,'' Ibrahim Legwell told The Associated Press in a
telephone interview from his Tripoli office.
	   US and British officials announced the agreement Monday in a bid
to end a 10-year impasse over the bombing.
	   The suspects would have safe passage from Libya to the
Netherlands _ and back to Libya _ if they are acquitted or if the
trial is discontinued, the letter says. U.N. sanctions ban
international flights to and from Libya.

	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli helicopters hunted down and killed
a guerrilla commander and warplanes blasted suspected militant
hideouts as fighting escalated in southern Lebanon on Tuesday,
security officials said.
	   Israeli television reported that the slain commander, Hossam
al-Amin, was second-in-command of the military faction of Shiite
Amal, the pro-Syrian party led by Lebanon's speaker of parliament,
Nabih Berri.
	   ``Al-Amin was personally responsible for the planning and
execution of many terrorist acts by Amal against the Israeli
Defense Force and the (allied) South Lebanon Army,'' an Israeli
military spokesman said in Jerusalem.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai warned of possible
retaliation.
	   ``We will continue to fight against terrorists and their leaders
who attack us and I wouldn't put it past the other side to carry
out retaliatory attacks,'' Mordechai told reporters.
	   Guerrillas detonated a roadside bomb that killed a militiaman of
the Israeli-backed SLA near Jezzine, a town 30 kilometers (19
miles) north of the Israeli border, the officials said.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the
attack.
	   Israel retaliated with an artillery bombardment and an air
strike on suspected guerrilla hideouts in the mountains around
Jezzine, officials said, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   Shells exploded in the town of Mashghara and the village of
Sohmor, which both lie about 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) outside the
Israeli-occupied zone. A car was set ablaze and several houses were
damaged.
	   Six Lebanese civilians, including a six-year-old boy, were
injured in the shelling and one Hezbollah guerrilla was hurt in the
air raid, the officials said.
	   Tuesday's fighting marked a sharp rise in tensions that have
been building steadily since last week, when three Israeli soldiers
were killed in two guerrilla attacks.
	   In the raid that killed the commander, two Israeli
helicopter-gunships flew in from the sea and attacked a car, a blue
BMW sedan, as it was driving along a coastal road about 15
kilometers (10 miles) north of the Israeli border and only about a
kilometer (mile) from a checkpoint of U.N. peacekeepers.
	   Security officials said a single rocket hit the car and killed
al-Amin, 31. The blast threw the vehicle about 10 meters (yards)
from the road.
	   A spokesman for Amal acknowledged the killing, but declined to
give al-Amin's rank.
	   It was the first time in six years that Israel has used
helicopter gunships to kill a marked man. In 1992 Israeli
helicopters blasted a motorcade of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah
group, killing its secretary general, Sheik Abbas Musawi.
	   Israel has previously used helicopter gunships to hunt down
commanders of Shiite guerrillas who are waging a war to dislodge
Israeli troops and the SLA militia from the occupied zone.

Angolan rebel group hints at support for Congo rebels
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Angola's former rebel group UNITA said
Tuesday it had interests to defend in neighboring Congo but stopped
short of openly acknowledging support for the insurrection against
President Laurent Kabila.
	   The Angolan government, which fought a two-decade civil war
against UNITA before the signing of a fragile 1994 peace accord, is
providing military support for Kabila against the insurgents _ a
coalition of ethnic Tutsi gunmen and disenchanted members of
Kabila's military.
	   ``UNITA cannot accept, for any reason, Angola's military
intervention'' in Congo, UNITA said in a statement from its
stronghold in Angola's central highlands and faxed to The
Associated Press in Lisbon.
	   ``If (the Angolan government) feels it has interests to defend
in the region, then let it be known that UNITA also has,'' the
statement warned.
	   A UNITA representative in Lisbon, Rui Oliveira, said his
movement could not provide military support to the Congolese rebels
because it had demobilized all its troops as part of the peace
accord.
	   However, the Angolan government claims that UNITA has some
25,000 troops hidden in the bush of the vast southwest African
country.
	   The entry of Angola, a former Portuguese colony, into Congo's
civil war may be driven by government concerns that Kabila's
departure could usher in a new administration that is sympathetic
to UNITA.
	   Angola last year helped Kabila oust President Mobutu Sese Seko,
the long-time ruler of then-Zaire and an ally of UNITA leader Jonas
Savimbi.
	   In return, Kabila agreed to cut off UNITA's supply lines across
the two countries' long and porous border. The supply routes had
allowed UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola _ to smuggle out diamonds and bring in
military equipment, according to the government.

Hungarian economy can weather Russian storm, ministers claim
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ The Hungarian economy is healthy enough
to weather any negative fallout from Russia's political and
financial crisis, the country's top financial leaders said Tuesday.
	   Prime Minister Viktor Orban called an emergency meeting of key
ministers and the head of the central bank Tuesday to assess the
impact of Russian developments, after the Hungarian stock exchange
plunged 6.6 percent Monday, in reaction to the Russian crisis.
	   Yet with only 4 percent of Hungarian exports going to Russia _
as opposed to 70 percent going the European Union _ the ministers
agreed the Russian developments will have no major negative impact
on the Hungarian economy.
	   ``In the view of the government and the Central Bank the Russian
crisis has no direct impact on the Hungarian economy,'' Economics
Minister Attila Chikan told reporters.
	   The Central Bank has indicated readiness to intervene to
stabilize the Hungarian forint, which fell to a record low of 228
against the U.S. dollar before rallying Monday and closing at
226.5, one point below its opening rate.
	   On Tuesday, both the market and the forint were on the rebound.
	   ``It seems the foreign exchange market is cooling,'' said
Central Bank head Gyoergy Suranyi, ``and the forint's fluctuations
do not exceed normal movement.''
	   ``It was not right that the stock exchange reacted like this to
Russian developments,'' said Minister of Finance Zsigmond Jarai.
	   Chikan said Russian developments and the involvement of
multilateral organizations and the support of foreign governments
``give grounds for hope that there will be a way out of the
situation and the crisis will not prove to be as deep as had been
initially feared.''

Taliban claims new victory against northern alliance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Afghanistan's Taliban Islamic militia
said Tuesday its fighters now plan to launch an offensive on
central Bamiyan province, one of their opposition's last major
strongholds, after winning another strategic valley.
	   Taliban radio, in a report that could not be independently
confirmed, said its fighters captured Kiyan Valley, 60 kilometers
(40 miles) south of Pul-i-Khumri. The opposition alliance suffered
heavy causalities and left behind a large number of light and heavy
weapons, it said. A number of opposition fighters were also taken
prisoner, the radio said.
	   The radio said the Taliban were planning an offensive against
the opposition in neighboring Bamiyan province. The opposition is
holed up in Bamiyan with Taliban in all the surrounding provinces,
snapping off their supply routes one by one.
	   The Taliban in a recent string of victories have ejected the
opposition from many strongholds, including Mazar-e-Sharif, the
biggest city in the north.
	   The Taliban now control most of Afghanistan, including the
capital Kabul. They have imposed a strict version of Islam, barring
most women from work, girls from education and directing men to
wear beards.

Uganda troops already in Congo to remain

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Uganda said Tuesday that troops it sent
to Congo months ago under an agreement with President Laurent
Kabila will remain the because of the breakdown of law and order in
its big neighbor to the west.
	   Foreign Minister Eriya Kategaya told parliament Uganda has not
taken sides in the current conflict that pits rebels, including
ethnic Tutsi soldiers and other disgruntled members of the
military, against Kabilia's government.
	   Kabila accuses both Uganda and Rwanda of supporting the rebels
who have seized most of the major towns in eastern Congo.
	   Legislators summoned Kategaya, a longtime associate of President
Yoweri Museveni, to explain the government's involvement in the
Congo crisis and to demand an explanation why troops were being
deployed in a foreign country without legislative authorization.
	   Kategaya said Ugandan troops were in northeastern and eastern
Congo under an agreement reached early this year with Kinshasa to
allow them to flush out members of the Allied Democratic Forces who
and other Ugandan rebel groups who launch attacks on western Uganda
from Congo.
	   ``When Kabila came (to Kampala), we agreed that our army
operates in the Congo to ensure that rebels do not attack Uganda,''
he said. ``Uganda must maintain that presence crucial to the
security of our people, especially since there is a breakdown of
civil authority in eastern Congo.''
	   He said Museveni, as head of state and commander in chief of the
armed forces, is by law allowed to bypass several procedures,
including consulting parliament, if the security of the country is
threatened.
	   Kategaya said despite the entry of Angola and Zimbabwe into the
conflict on Kabila's side, Uganda continues to recognize his
government and does not support the war.
	   ``The Congo has a government inplace, and we recognize Kabila,''
he said. ``The solution to the problems in the Congo should be
political, and we do not support the war there.''

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Tutsi rebels in eastern Congo attacked a
Roman Catholic mission crowded with refugees from that nation's
fighting, killing 37 people, the Vatican's missionary news service
said Tuesday.
	   A priest, two nuns and a seminary student died alongside 32
refugees, the Fides news service said. The attack happened Sunday
in the remote parish of Kasika, near Uvira in Congo's South Kivu
province, Fides said.
	   Tutsi rebels are part of a coalition fighting to oust Congo
President Laurent Kabila.
	   The rebels attacked because they suspected the local people of
giving food to a pro-government militia, Fides said. The killings
marked the first time that Catholic priests and nuns had been
targeted for such reprisals, the news service said.
	   All the dead were Congolese, Fides said.

Track cycling championships begin

 &UR; By SALVATORE ZANCA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) - After the doping scandal plagued the
Tour de France, the attention in cycling now shifts to the World
Championships starting Wednesday where the bulky track sprinters
already have known problems with steroids and disqualifications in
the past.
	   The International Cycling Union will be under scrutiny to see
how it will handle the doping problem in the first major
international competition organized by the UCI since the Tour de
France.
	   There are 12 titles up for grabs with most concentrating on the
sprints where bursts of speeds are necessary -- and could be helped
by performance-enhancing drugs.
	   Well before the doping scandal on the route of the Tour de
France, there were already problems with doping at the world
championships on the track.
	   In 1991, the first and third placers in the sprint event were
found to have steroids in their system and had to give up their
medals. Carey Hall and Stephen Pate were suspended. The title is
listed as vacant in the records of the championship.
	   The French team will do its part to make the cycling world
forget its problems with another stellar team. At last year's
championships in Perth, Australia, France took exactly half the
titles, capturing 6 of 12.
	   Led by its stars, Florian Rousseau and Felicia Ballanger, France
hopes to do well again. Rousseau is looking to defend his title
against in the sprint event as well as helping his team in the
Olympic sprint event.
	   Rousseau might even add another gold with a chance in the
individual pursuit. He recently beat his teammate --- and defending
world champion -- Philippe Ermenault -- at the national
championships in that event.
	   Australia, with three-time kilometer champion Shane Kelly, and
Germany, with the nucleus of its World Cup team, will also
challenge for titles.
	   In the women's events, Ballanger has won two titles for the last
three years. She has won the 500-meter time trial and the
individual sprint in 1995 at Bogota, Colombia, 1996 at Manchester,
England and 1997 at Perth.
	   Her rivalry with Australia's Michelle Ferris was one of the
highlights of over the past three years.
	   The competition starts with two finals on Wednesday -- the men's
kilometer time trial and the men's individual pursuit. The events
last until Sunday.
	   The road championships -- where France won three titles last
year -- will be in the Netherlands in October.

Clarke narrows Westwood's tour lead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIRGINIA WATER, England (AP) _ Darren Clarke narrowed Lee
Westwood's lead on the PGA European Tour money list with a fourth
place finish in the European Open at Dublin's K Club.
	   First or second place would have given the Northern Ireland
golfer No.1 spot on the tour but it came down to an eagle chance
Sunday on the 18th hole in the last round, which he missed.
	   Clarke finished with a 2-under par total 286, 11 strokes behind
winner Mathias Gronberg, and one stroke behind Miguel Angel Jimenez
and Philip Price.
	   Westwood, who leads the tour money list with 590,385 pounds
(dlrs 970,593), suffered a recurrence of a hip injury and withdrew
from the European Open in the last round.
	   He will miss the BMW International at Munich starting Thursday,
where a good result for Clarke could see him overtake Westwood.

Sudan's elderly abandoned as famine worsens

	   THIET, Sudan (AP) _ More than 150 frail old men and women wait
impatiently beneath a blazing sun for a handout that could spare
them from starvation.
	   Finally, two women emerge from a mud hut bearing a huge pot
steaming with energy-enriched porridge that clearly won't feed
everyone. Turmoil breaks out.
	   Weak but determined, the hungry Sudanese struggle to grab a
share of the lumpy white cereal until security guards beat them
back with sticks.
	   An old man falls to his knees, raises his arms and begs:
``Please, give me some food.''
	   He gets nothing but harsh words from the guards.
	   ``When starvation is around, it's survival of the fittest,''
says Jenny Kinsingular, who works as a health team leader in the
World Vision feeding center in Thiet, nearly 1,000 kilometers (625
miles) southwest of Khartoum.
	   As the Sudan's famine deepens, many families are abandoning
their elderly _ a disturbing trend in a culture where old people
are traditionally respected for their wisdom and lifetime
achievements.
	   ``The noose is being tightened, and sometimes the doors of huts
are being slammed even on kinship ties,'' said Brenda Barton,
spokeswoman for the World Food Program.
	   Food has long been a key weapon in Sudan's destructive 15-year
civil war, fought mainly in the south.
	   The Sudan People's Liberation Army is battling a government
dominated by northern Arabs. They seek more autonomy for black
southerners, who are mostly Christians or members of tribal faiths.
	   The United States regards the regime of Sudanese President Omar
el-Bashir as one of the world's key promoters of international
terrorism.
	   Last week, U.S. missiles struck a Sudanese factory that U.S.
President Bill Clinton said manufactured chemical weapons. It was
retaliation for the bombing of two U.S. embassies in East Africa.
Sudan insists the plant made only medicines.
	   While most aid flights are still supplying southern Sudan, the
German government indefinitely postponed plans to send four cargo
planes to deliver food to hungry northerners.
	   This year, a drought followed in some areas by flooding is
turning into a killer famine, fueled by enemy raiders who burn
meager crops and donated food and fighting that has displaced
millions.
	   An estimated 2.5 million Sudanese are going hungry, all but
200,000 of them in the south, Barton said. Donors have given dlrs
128 million for food aid, but another dlrs 26 million will be
needed through April, she said.
	   Much of the food is dropped from the air by huge cargo planes.
At least 11,000 tons rains down on southern Sudan each month, but
that's 4,000 tons short of what is needed, says John Hayes, manager
of Operation Lifeline Sudan.
	   U.N. agencies have been delivering food to Sudan's hungry for
almost 30 years. With war still being waged, Hayes doesn't expect
to the need to subside any time soon.
	   ``In one year, we will have the same talk,'' Hayes said at his
base of Lokichokio, in northwestern Kenya, where another cargo
plane was growling to a start, its belly full of desperately needed
food.

Two bombs damage Athens bank, town planning headquarters
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with leftist group claiming responsibility &QL; 1

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Two makeshift gas canister bombs exploded
in central Athens early Monday, one outside a bank and the other
outside the capital's town planning headquarters, causing damage
but no injuries, police said.
	   The first bomb, consisting of 15 propane gas canisters, severely
damaged a Commercial Bank branch in the Kypseli district, police
said. Damage was estimated at around 40 million drachmas (dlrs
130,000).
	   Commercial is the parent bank of Ionian Bank, which is currently
undergoing privatization. Bids for Ionian were made Monday, but no
decision was taken on the sale.
	   A much smaller bomb exploded later outside Athens' town planning
headquarters in the city center, causing minor damage to the
building.
	   A little-known group called Autonomous Cells of Revolutionary
Action claimed responsibility in a telephone call to a local radio
station. The group has claimed five attacks so far this year,
including the April bombing of a branch office of Britain's
Barcleys bank.
	   The group said it was protesting the January arrest of Nikos
Maziotis, who was charged with heading a leftist firebombing ring.
	   Several arson attacks since then have been claimed by groups
protesting Maziotis' arrest.
	   Similar devices have been used to torch more than 150 cars and
offices since January. They belonged to officials, politicians,
Jewish and anti-Semitic groups, diplomats, journalists and
foreigners.
	   Most have been claimed by shadowy groups little known to
authorities.

Serbs accused of killing three charity workers in Kosovo

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police, on the offensive in
Kosovo, were accused Tuesday of killing three ethnic Albanian
charity workers who were taking humanitarian aid to refugees.
	   The report came amid a storm of new international criticism of
the Serbs for their attacks in secessionist Kosovo.
	   The Kosovo Humanitarian and Charitable Society ``Mother Teresa''
said the three workers were killed Monday after police allowed them
to pass through a checkpoint near Malisevo, a former rebel
stronghold in central Kosovo that Serb forces overran last month.
	   Palok Berishaj, secretary of the aid organization, said
apparently a shell hit the tractor they were riding on to take aid
into the region, one of the most densely refugee-populated in the
war-torn province of southern Serbia. The ethnic Albanian daily
Koha Ditore cited witnesses Tuesday as saying that police fired the
shell.
	   The Pristina daily Koha Ditore and the Albanians' Kosovo
Information Center gave similar accounts.
	   The charity, based in Pristina, is responsible for the bulk of
humanitarian assistance to the province, distributing such items as
wheat flour and soap. It is not affiliated with the Missionaries of
Charity, Mother Teresa's India-based Roman Catholic order. It
receives funding from the Catholic relief group Caritas.
	   As U.S. envoy Christopher Hill prepared to meet in Belgrade with
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, there were new reports of
fighting and more condemnation of the Serbs.
	   Serbian police and the Yugoslav army continued shelling several
villages southwest of Pristina in their drive to crush separatist
resistance among Kosovo's majority ethnic Albanians.
	   According to the Kosovo Information Center, after killing three
ethnic Albanians in clashes Monday the Serbs were targeting seven
villages in the Suva Reka region on Tuesday and were setting ablaze
houses after dousing them with gasoline.
	   ``We denounce the continuing violence in Kosovo which is forcing
more people to flee,'' spokesman Kris Janowski of the UNHCR said
Tuesday in Geneva. ``The situation is getting worse and worse.''
	   He said the U.N. agency is planning to double its staff in
Pristina to around 14 but has been hindered by delays in obtaining
visas from Belgrade authorities.
	   UNHCR sent a 10-truck convoy Tuesday to refugees in the Baranski
Do region 60 kilometers (35 miles) west of Pristina, carrying food,
medicine, clothes and blankets. Humanitarian agencies estimate that
as many as 50,000 refugees in Kosovo are living in the open.
	   Amnesty International also deplored the violence, and called
attention to both the vulnerability of women to human rights abuses
in Kosovo and the rising number of victims who have gone missing.
	   ``The disappeared and missing are the hidden victims of
Kosovo,'' the London-based human rights group said. It said all
ethnic groups are affected: ``Ethnic Albanians have disappeared in
Serbian police hands; Serbs, Albanians and Roma are missing after
abduction by the KLA.''
	   In New York on Monday, the U.N. Security Council urged a
cease-fire in the Yugoslav province and warned of a humanitarian
disaster if fighting continues. But the statement reflected the
lack of any consensus among council members on how to halt the
conflict.
	   ``The authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the
Kosovo Albanians must achieve a political solution to the issue of
Kosovo,'' the 15-member council said in a statement. It said that
as winter approaches, the plight of refugees will worsen.
	   The Serbs, meanwhile, accused the ethnic Albanians' Kosovo
Liberation Army of making more guerrilla attacks against them. The
pro-Serb Media Center said a group of rebels ambushed an ambulance
on Monday, wounding the driver, a doctor and another passenger.

Italian rider proclaims innocence, seeks team switch
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italian cyclist Francesco Casagrande, second in the
World Cup standings, denied Tuesday that he had taken banned
substances and said he plans to switch teams so he can continue to
compete.
	   Casagrande, who has twice failed doping tests in recent months,
was questioned by the Italian Olympic Committee, whose anti-doping
commission will now examine his case before passing it on to the
national cycling federation.
	   ``I did not take banned substances,'' said Casagrande, who won
the San Sebastian classic in Spain Aug. 8. ``I took five or six
tests and the testosterone level fluctuated. I think it's because
my natural testosterone level varies. If I had taken banned
substances, the level would have been constant.''
	   Casagrande said he will ``come out of this matter with my head
high and a clean conscience.''
	   He said he wants to leave his current team, French outfit
Cofidis, which has asked him to sit out competition while his case
is still pending.
	   ``I am not suspended because until I have been found guilty I
can compete in any race,'' the Italian said. ``But my current team,
Cofidis, does not want me to. I intend to change teams because
otherwise I would miss out on important events.''

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 
	   NAGS HEAD, North Carolina (AP) _ About 200,000 residents and
visitors were ordered to leave North Carolina's low-lying, exposed
Outer Banks today as Hurricane Bonnie accelerated on a path that
could carry its fury into the barrier island chain.
	   The U.S. National Weather Service said Bonnie's center with its
115 mph (185 kmh) wind could be near the Outer Banks by Wednesday
afternoon.
	   Hurricane warnings were posted from Murrells Inlet, South
Carolina, to the North Carolina-Virginia state line. The warnings
mean dangerous wind and heavy rain could hit the area within 24
hours. Hurricane watches extended south to Savannah, Georgia, and
north to Cape Henlopen, Delaware.
	   While the storm was still hundreds of miles (kilometers) away,
the Atlantic was showing its effects with 10-foot (3-meter) waves
reported on the North Carolina beach. Gray, white-capped waves hit
the New Jersey shore in breakers 4 feet to 6 feet (1.2 meters to
1.8 meters) high, pounding onto the sand with a dull roar.
	   The state of Virginia and some coastal communities elsewhere had
already banned swimming because of rip tides _ strong currents near
the beaches _ that are blamed for three drownings over the weekend
in South Carolina, North Carolina and Delaware. One man was
missing.
	   By midmorning Tuesday, the storm's eye was centered about 450
miles (725 kilometers) south of Cape Hatteras, which sits on the
Outer Banks 50 miles (80 kilometers) south of Nags Head. Its outer
ring of clouds was not even reaching the mainland yet as the
hurricane wobbled toward the northwest at about 11 mph (18 kmh).
	   Evacuation orders, which were called mandatory although they
don't have the force of law and can't be enforced, were issued for
the Outer Banks by Dare County and Ocracoke, an island accessible
only by ferry. Farther south, Carteret County planned to decide
whether to order an evacuation after a late morning meeting.
	   Although the hurricane warning covered part of South Carolina,
Gov. David Beasley said today there was no reason yet to evacuate
any of that state's coast.
	   Nearly 2,000 South Carolina National Guard troops and law
enforcement officers were available to conduct an evacuation if one
becomes necessary, said Gary Karr, a spokesman for Beasley.
	   People on the Outer Banks were urged to head for the mainland
immediately.
	   But as dawn broke with a blue sky, runners took their morning
jog on the beach road and golfers kept their tee times.
	   Residents of the North Carolina shore haven't forgotten about
Hurricane Fran, which struck the region in 1996.
	   ``It's really starting to concern people around here,'' said
Ronna Lewis, whose home on North Carolina's Topsail Beach, perched
four feet off the ground on concrete supports, escaped flooding
during Fran by inches. ``It's just hurry up, wait and see.''
	   People all along the East Coast had been buying emergency
supplies. Plywood, batteries and gas cans were the hot items at
Bame Ace Hardware in Carolina Beach, North Carolina.
	   ``It's pretty hectic,'' said Chris Eason. ``We had people
actually coming in with a list of what went wrong last time and are
doing it right this time.''
	   Meanwhile, the weather service said Monday that a tropical
depression east of the Caribbean had developed into the fourth
tropical storm of the season. Danielle was located about 1,200
miles (1,900 kilometers) east of the Lesser Antilles, moving
west-northwest about 21 mph (34 kmh).
	   In Texas, the remnants of Tropical Storm Charley flooded parts
of South Texas, leaving much the town of Del Rio near the Rio
Grande under water. At least 15 deaths in Texas and Mexico were
blamed on the floods.

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Rough cut images of road accidents slowly
blend into the face of a popular racing driver who turns over an
empty beer glass and says: ``Don't be stupid. Don't let yourself be
killed.''
	   The 30-second television spot that begins airing Wednesday
launches a one-week campaign against drunk driving sponsored by
four major brewers in formerly communist Poland's latest step
toward Western-style public relations.
	   Trying to curb deeply imbued drinking habits in this nation of
39 million people is a serious task. No party, wedding, christening
or funeral in the devoutly Catholic country goes without heavy
consumption of vodka, wine and beer. Few think twice before driving
home.
	   ``We don't ask our clients to stop drinking our beer, but we ask
them not to get behind the wheel if they have drunk,'' said Andrzej
Dlugosz, corporate affairs director at the Elbrewery Co. LTD, which
is co-owned by the Dutch beer maker Heineken.

Researcher holds missing pages of Anne Frank diary hostage
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with efforts to reach Suijk, quotes from
colleague. &QL; 
 &UR; By WILLIAM J. KOLE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ A former employee of the Anne
Frank Foundation who has five missing pages of ``The Diary of Anne
Frank'' says he'll give them back _ but only if fellow Dutch
scholars promote his Holocaust research in the United States.
	   Cor Suijk's threats of academic blackmail in a television
interview Monday evening have upset the Netherlands State Institute
for War Documentation, which revealed the existence of the missing
pages last week.
	   ``We've asked a lawyer to try to find a way out of this,'' David
Barnouw, spokesman for the war documentation center, said Tuesday.
	   Suijk claims that Otto Frank, father of the young Jewish diarist
whose account of hiding from the Nazis has become an international
bestseller in 55 languages, gave him the pages shortly before his
death in 1980.
	   A longtime Anne Frank Foundation employee known to have been a
close friend of Otto Frank, Suijk told RTL television Monday that
the elder Frank made him promise the pages wouldn't be published
until the entire family was dead.
	   The war documentation center, which wants the pages back so they
can be included in the next edition of Anne's diary, contends that
Otto Frank never intended to make a gift of them to Suijk.
	   Suijk, international director of the New York-based Anne Frank
Center USA, a sister organization of the Amsterdam foundation, did
not return phone calls seeking comment Tuesday.
	   Former colleagues, meanwhile, defended his decision to withhold
the pages for almost two decades, denying media claims that Suijk
is more concerned with self-promotion than remaining true to Otto
Frank's wishes.
	   ``He is beyond a shadow of a doubt a man of integrity,'' Gerrold
van der Stroom, a co-editor of ``The Diary of Anne Frank _ The
Critical Edition,'' told the daily De Volkskrant.
	   The war documentation center, citing the diary copyright held by
the Basel, Switzerland-based Anne Frank Fund, will say only that
the handwritten pages appear to be authentic and contain Anne's
``very critical'' assessment of her parents' marriage.
	   Suijk said their contents will be revealed Sept. 14 in a Dutch
documentary about Anne's two years in hiding in a secret annex
behind a movable bookcase in an Amsterdam canal house.
	   He told RTL he was willing to part with the pages, but only if
the war documentation center agrees to support his own independent
research into the Holocaust and promote it in America.
	   The diary, a modern literary classic that has become required
reading in schools worldwide, has inspired numerous books, films
and a hit play.

Colombian lawmakers, rebel representatives meet in Geneva
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Colombian lawmakers and representatives of the
country's second largest rebel group have met near Geneva in Red
Cross-facilitated talks, a Red Cross spokesman confirmed Tuesday.
	   The talks between six Colombian congressmen and three
representatives of the National Liberation Army, or ELN, took place
at a venue near the city, said Ruben Ortega, spokesman for the
International Committee of the Red Cross.
	   ``We know nothing about the content'' of Monday's meeting, which
lasted until late in the evening, Ortega said.
	   He declined to give the names of those taking part, but said
Colombian President Andres Pastrana's peace envoy, Victor G.
Ricardo, wasn't among them.
	   Several Colombian news media reported that Ricardo was to meet
Tuesday in Geneva under Red Cross auspices with representatives of
the ELN and the country''s largest rebel groupn
	   The talks were intended to discuss peace efforts and the
possible liberation of a congressmen kidnapped in Colombia by the
guerrillas.
	   Although the ICRC facilitated the meeting, it didn't participate
in any way, Ortega said.
	   An official at the Colombian diplomatic mission in Geneva said
it had no involvement in the talks.
	   The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia and the 5,000-member
ELN have been fighting the government since the 1960s and have
gained militarily during the past year over a dispirited army.

Polish government backs 2006 Olympic bid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Poland's government gave its formal
support Tuesday for Zakopane's bid to host the 2006 Winter
Olympics, promising to speed up needed infrastructure improvements
and cover any financial loss from the Games.
	   ``The Olympics in Zakopane are a very important and prestigious
enterprise and a chance for Poland,'' Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek
said before the meeting.
	   Zakopane, a mountain resort 330 kilometers (200 miles) south of
Warsaw near the border with Slovakia, is one of six competitors for
the 2006 Games. Others are Sion, Switzerland; Poprad-Tatry,
Slovakia; Turin, Italy; Helsinki, Finland, together with
Lillehammer, Norway; and Klagenfurt, Austria, making a
three-country bid that includes regions of Slovenia and Italy.
	   Zakopane Mayor Adam Bachleda-Curus said the government promised
to cover any shortfall in the proposed dlrs 855 million operating
budget for the Olympics.
	   The International Olympic Committee was expected to contribute
dlrs 415 million, and Bachleda-Curus said he expected no problem as
the last three Winter Olympics made money. He estimated a dlrs 10
million profit.
	   Winning the right to host the Olympics would raise Poland's
profile at a time when it is planning to join NATO and negotiating
to join the European Union, Bachleda-Curus noted.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Janusz Tomaszewski said much-needed
development plans for roads, railways and an airport would be
speeded up.
	   Some projects, such as improving the 100 kilometer (60 mile)
road from Zakopane to Krakow, were needed whether or not Zakopane
hosts the Games, Tomasewski said. The road is one of the most
dangerous in Poland.
	   Since the end of communist rule in 1989, Poland has enjoyed
steady economic growth and development but still lags behind major
Western countries in its infrastructure, services and technology.
	   The IOC will choose the host of the 2006 Winter Games in June
1999.
	   Sion is considered an early front-runner. The Swiss city was
among the finalists in the race for the 2002 Winter Games, which
were awarded to Salt Lake City.

<TEXT>
	   ROBBEN ISLAND, South Africa (AP) _ Nigerian leader Gen.
Abdulsalam Abubakar proclaimed Tuesday that Nigeria's election
announcement ``shows our determination to grow democratically.''
	   But Abubakar, perhaps unintentionally, injected a note of
uncertainty in his comments to reporters about the announcement
that presidential elections will be held next Feb. 27, with the new
president to be sworn in on May 29.
	   ``It shows our determination to grow democratically and,
hopefully, come May we will hand over to whoever is elected,''
Abubakar said.
	   He did not elaborate on his use of the word ``hopefully.'' He
further applauded the announcement by saying: ``It's a good omen
for progress.''
	   Abubakar, who has freed political prisoners since coming to
power in Africa's most populous country last June, made his
comments in a poignant setting: the island prison where President
Nelson Mandela spent most of his 27-year prison sentence.
	   Earlier Tuesday, Abubakar told parliament that military rule was
no longer acceptable in Nigeria.
	   ``We have now unequivocally chosen democracy as our preferred
option of governance,'' he said. ``Nigerians want nothing less than
true democracy in a
	   united and peaceful country.''
	   Abubakar arrived Tuesday on a first state visit to South Africa
by a Nigerian leader.

Tender for Ionian Bank annulled
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece's Commercial Bank on Tuesday
annulled the tender for the sale of a 51 percent stake in Ionian
Bank, Greece's fourth largest, after the two top bidders were found
not to be credible.
	   Commercial is the parent bank of Ionian.
	   A new tender will take place within three months, National
Economy and Finance Minister Yannos Papantoniou said.
	   Ionian is the largest bank to be privatized and a key element in
the socialist government's effort to meet targets for participation
in the European Union's single currency by 2001.
	   But government spokesman Dimitris Reppas stressed that the
tender's failure would not affect the country's economy. ``The
course of our country's economy is steady, it is positive and
rising. It is not connected to the sale of a medium bank,'' he
said.
	   Three bids were submitted for the bank Monday, with the highest
submitted by U.S. law firm Jan Morton Heger representing an unknown
American consortium offering dlrs 1.12 billion.
	   An Italian-American holding company called Exchange Finance
Overseas offered dlrs 1 billion.
	   Greek billionaire Spyros Latsis' Eurobank group, one of the
favorites for purchasing Ionian, submitted a bid far below the
bank's current stock market value of 250 billion drachmas (dlrs 825
million).
	   Eurobank offered 135.6 billion drachmas (dlrs 447 million) for
Ionian, despite statements by Papantoniou that the tender could be
annulled if offers fell far below Ionian's stock market value.
	   The stock market's general index slid to close 3.6 percent down
following Monday's news of a decision on the Ionian sale being
delayed. But the bourse had closed when the tender's annulment was
announced.
	   The government's plans to privatize Ionian prompted violent
reactions from the bank's staff in May, leading to a six-week
strike by employees seeking to maintain benefits and the guarantee
of a job until the retirement age of 62.

Sweden's coach announces European qualification squad
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Sweden's national team coach Tommy
Soderberg announced Tuesday his squad for the opening European Cup
qualifier against England at home Sept. 5.
	   Sweden, which missed out of the World Cup soccer finals in
France this summer, will use virtually the same squad that had won
three out of the last four games and drawn one.
	   In the pre-World Cup season, Sweden beat Italy and Denmark by
1-0, respectively, and played a scoreless tie against the to-be
world champions, France.
	   Soderberg, an admirer of English soccer, relied again primarily
on foreign-based players.
	   Midfielder Kennet Andersson, who suffered a thigh injury last
weekend with Bologna, will be examined by doctors Wednesday.
Soderberg hopes for a quick recovery as Andersson will be badly
needed against England, being very strong in the air.
	   The squad:
	   Goalies: Magnus Hedman, Coventry, Magnus Kihlstedt, Lillestroem.
	   Defenders: Patrik Andersson, Borussia Moenchengladbach; Joachim
Bjoerklund, Valencia; Pontus Kamark, Leicester; Teddy Lucic, IFK
Goteborg; Johan Mjaellby, AIK; Roland Nilsson, Coventry.
	   Midfielders/forwards: Andreas Andersson, Newcastle; Daniel
Andersson, Bari; Kennet Andersson, Bologna; Magnus Erlingmark,
Goteborg; Henrik Larsson, Celtic; Fredrik Ljungberg, Halmstad;
Haakan Mild, Goteborg; Jorgen Pettersson, Moenchengladbach; Stefan
Schwarz, Valencia; Paer Zetterberg, Anderlecht.

	   The legislation would apply only to organizations named in the
legislation. Blair did not list them in his announcement.
	   ``The days of the men of violence must be consigned to the past
where they belong,'' Blair said, standing at the crossroads bombed
on Aug. 15 by the so-called Real IRA, a splinter group which has
refused to join in the Irish Republican Army's cease-fire.
	   The special session next week will come just before U.S.
President Bill Clinton's visit to Northern Ireland.
	   Sinn Fein, the IRA's political ally, said Blair's proposed
legislation was a ``massive overreaction'' that could jeopardize
the peace process.
	   ``The great danger in introducing these measures is that we
could have a situation developing which could have great and
serious implications for the peace agreement and Sinn Fein's role
within it,'' Martin McGuinness, Sinn Fein spokesman, said in a
British Broadcasting Corp. television interview.
	   Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern also has pledged new
anti-terrorist laws, and the Irish Parliament is expected to meet
in emergency session in Dublin starting Sept. 2.
	   The Irish and British legislation is aimed at dissident groups
who failed to endorse the Northern Ireland peace agreement accepted
by the Irish Republican Army and Sinn Fein. Those groups include
the Real IRA, which admitted it planted the Omagh bomb.
	   Until now, convicting people of membership of outlawed groups
has been extremely difficult. The groups keep no written records of
membership, senior members do not involve themselves directly in
perpetrating attacks, and potential civilian witnesses risk being
killed as informers.
	   McGuinness called Northern Ireland's predominantly Protestant
Royal Ulster Constabulary the most discredited police force in
Western Europe and said innocent people therefore could be jailed.

Woosnam angry at missing out on Ryder Cup job
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Former Masters champion Ian Woosman is angry at
being passed over for Europe's Ryder Cup captaincy.
	   ``I would like to have been captain,'' the Welshman was quoted
as saying in Tuesday's Daily Mail. ``I think somebody should have
asked me if I was interested.''
	   England's Mark James, a 44-year-old veteran of seven Ryder Cup
teams, is widely expected to be the choice when the new captain is
announced Wednesday at a news conference in Munich on the eve of
the BMW International.
	   Woosnam has won 43 titles worldwide, including the 1991 Masters,
and played in eight successive Ryder Cups since 1983.
	   ``Mark James is favorite for the job but there are other players
who deserved to be considered like Eamonn Darcy and Christy
O'Connor Jr. who have all done a lot for the Ryder Cup over the
years,'' Woosnam said.
	   Woosnam said he still wants to make the team as a player for the
1999 Ryder Cup in Brookline, Mass.
	   ``I still want to be involved in the Ryder Cup,'' he said. ``I'l
do my best to qualify for the team. But the offer still stands. I'm
willing to be captain at some stage. And I think I would do a good
job too.''
	   Seve Ballesteros stepped down as captain after guiding the
Europeans to victory over the Americans last year at Valderrama in
Spain.
	   The Spaniard had recommended Bernhard Langer as his successor
but the German said he wasn't interested because he wants to play
in two more Cups.
	   Another contender, Scotland's Sam Torrance, also ruled himself
out of consideration because he wants to make the team as a player
after failing to qualify in 1997.

Ritz Hotel president, assistant meet Diana judge
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with second hotel official questioned, no comment from
hotel

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The president of the Ritz Hotel and his assistant
were questioned by a French judge Tuesday about the night that
Princess Diana was killed.
	   It was the first time Judge Herve Stephan had questioned Ritz
management about the car crash nearly one year ago that killed
Diana, her boyfriend Dodi Fayed and driver Henri Paul shortly after
they left the hotel.
	   Frank Klein, president of the Ritz Hotel Ltd., was questioned by
Stephan for two hours at the Palais de Justice in central Paris,
then left without any comment to reporters.
	   Claude Roulet, assistant to the president, was questioned for 90
minutes by Judge Stephan and also left without speaking to
journalists.
	   A Ritz spokeswoman said by telephone that the hotel was making
no comment until the end of the investigation.
	   The Ritz is owned by Mohamed Al Fayed, father of Dodi Fayed.
	   The car crashed last Aug. 31 in the Pont de l'Alma traffic
tunnel after leaving the Ritz. The Ritz had rented the Mercedes
from the Etoile Limousine Co.
	   Driver Paul was drunk at the time of the crash, and believed to
be driving at a very high speed.
	   The only survivor was bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones, who worked
for Al Fayed at the time but has since resigned. Rees-Jones'
lawyer, Christian Curtil, recently asked Stephan to question Klein
about possible security lapses at the Ritz that night.
	   There also have been questions raised about whether the Mercedes
was faulty. The judge has heard testimony that the car was
precarious if the brakes were slammed on suddenly.

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Tutsi rebels in eastern Congo attacked a
Roman Catholic mission crowded with refugees from that nation's
fighting, killing 37 people, the Vatican's missionary news service
said Tuesday.
	   A priest, three nuns and a seminary student died alongside 32
refugees, the Fides news service said. The attack happened Sunday
in the remote parish of Kasika, 80 kilometers (50 miles) northwest
of Uvira in Congo's South Kivu province, Fides said.
	   Tutsi rebels are part of a coalition fighting to oust Congo
President Laurent Kabila.
	   The rebels attacked because they suspected the local people of
giving food to a pro-government militia, Fides said. The killings
marked the first time that Catholic priests and nuns had been
targeted for such reprisals, the news service said.
	   All the dead were Congolese, Fides said.

North Korea says U.N. rights resolution aims to destroy country
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ North Korea accused a U.N. human rights panel
Tuesday of aiming to destroy it by singling it out in a resolution
urging compliance with world rights agreements.
	   ``There is no independent country that would accept this kind of
resolution,'' said Kim Song Chol, a diplomat from the North Korean
mission to U.N. offices in Geneva.
	   The panel, which comprises 26 independent experts who routinely
pass resolutions criticizing many countries, said it ``strongly
urges the government to allow and facilitate inquiries'' by
independent national and international human rights organizations.
	   It urged human rights bodies to give more attention to North
Korea and call attention to the ``food shortages and other economic
hardships endured by its citizens.''
	   A year ago North Korea took the unprecedented step of
withdrawing from a U.N. human rights accord, the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, because of a more critical
statement by the same panel.
	   Panel members said then that there had been ``persistent and
concordant allegations that grave violations of human rights are
being committed in that country.''
	   The 1997 resolution noted allegations of mass internment in
``administrative detention centers'' and ``serious restrictions''
on the rights of North Korean citizens to leave or enter their
country.
	   The carefully worded resolution adopted Tuesday on a 19-4 vote
by the U.N. subcommission on human rights, reaffirmed that ``all
member states have the obligation to promote and protect human
rights and fundamental freedoms.''
	   The government should let human rights organizations to publish
and distribute all their findings inside North Korea, the
resolution said.
	   ``We categorically reject the resolution aimed at isolating and
destroying our country,'' said Kim.
	   He complained to reporters that the sub-commission members had
drafted the resolution without consulting the North Korean
government delegation.
	   ``The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
provides genuine human rights to its people,'' he said.

Security Council beginning talks on Lockerbie resolution

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council began preliminary
consultations Tuesday on a deal to lift U.N. sanctions against
Libya after two Libyan suspects in the 1988 Pan Am bombing appear
in court in the Netherlands, diplomats said.
	   A resolution to lift sanctions was mentioned Monday in a letter
sent by the U.S. and British governments to Secretary-General Kofi
Annan. The letter requested Annan to relay details of their
proposal to Libya and help the government transfer the two suspects
to the court.
	   ``Once the suspects are handed over and appear in court as
communicated by the secretary-general, the sanctions could be
lifted,'' a British diplomat said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   U.S. and British officials announced their proposal in a bid to
end a 10-year impasse over the bombing, which killed 259 people
aboard Pan Am Flight 103 and 11 people on the ground at Lockerbie,
Scotland.
	   Libya has refused to turn two suspects over, fearing they
couldn't get a fair trial in the United States or Scotland. The
proposal calls for the suspects to be tried by Scottish judges
under Scottish law in The Netherlands.
	   According to the proposal, the only change to normal Scottish
law is that the jury will be replaced by a panel of three Scottish
High Court judges.
	   The proposal also stipulates that the suspects cannot be
extradited from The Netherlands, and if convicted, they would serve
their term in the United Kingdom.
	   The suspects will have safe passage from Libya to the
Netherlands and back to Libya if they are acquitted or if the trial
is discontinued, the letter said.
	   The 7-year-old U.N. sanctions against Libya include an air
embargo and curbs on arms sales and on certain financial and travel
activities.
	   Libya has not commented on the initiative.
	   ``We trust that Libya will respond promptly, positively and
unequivocally by ensuring the timely appearance of the two
accused,'' the letter said.
	   ``If it does not do so, our two governments reserve the right to
propose further sanctions at the time of the next Security Council
review. They also reserve the right to withdraw this initiative.''
	   The proposal also said that Libya must produce the suspects in a
timely manner, produce evidence _ including witnesses _ to appear
before the court, and comply with Security Council resolutions.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan was ``extremely pleased,'' about
the proposal and ``hopes that all sides will cooperate in order to
reach an early resolution to this longstanding issue,'' spokesman
Fred Eckhard said Monday.
	   The proposal says the initiative is an approach which has been
endorsed by the Organization of African Unity, the League of Arab
States, the Non-Aligned Movement and the Islamic Conference.

Bosnian Croat leaders snubs Croatia's president
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ A key Bosnian Croat leader,
now in opposition, rejected Tuesday an invitation from Croatian
President Franjo Tudjman for pre-election talks in Zagreb.
	   The move by Kresimir Zubak, who is the Croat member of the
three-man Bosnian presidency, signaled that the rift among Croat
moderates and hard-liners in Croatia and Bosnia is widening.
	   Zubak was elected to the job as a leader of Tudjman's party,
HDZ, in Bosnia. Earlier this year Zubak and several other key HDZ
members split from the hard-line party and formed a new Bosnian
Croat moderate opposition party _ The New Croat Initiative.
	   Two other Croat opposition candidates for the three-member
Bosnian presidency _ Senka Nozica and Gradimir Gojer _ also have
refused Tudjman's invitation in the past few days.
	   Over the past months, the Bosnian Croat opposition has been
accusing Tudjman of supporting the Bosnian hard-line branch of his
Croatian party rather than true interests of Croats in Bosnia.
	   Despite being president of a neighboring country, Tudjman has
been controlling Croats in Bosnia over the past years. The
rejection of his invitation is an unprecedented move and is likely
to deliver a serious blow to the Croatian president.
	   Tuesday's refusal by Zubak to meet with Tudjman came as the
biggest surprise and the strongest signal.
	   Western diplomats welcomed the split and are trying to support
Zubak and his party, hoping that he would be able to end the rule
of the hard-line HDZ party in the Croat-controlled areas in Bosnia
in the Sept. 12-13 general elections.

Gen. Abubakar says Nigeria determined to grow democratically
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROBBEN ISLAND, South Africa (AP) _ Nigerian leader Gen.
Abdulsalam Abubakar proclaimed Tuesday that Nigeria's election
announcement proved his country is determined to become democratic.
	   But Abubakar, perhaps unintentionally, injected a note of
uncertainty in his comments about the announcement that
presidential elections will be held next Feb. 27, with the new
president to be sworn in on May 29.
	   ``It shows our determination to grow democratically and,
hopefully, come May we will hand over to whoever is elected,''
Abubakar told reporters.
	   He did not elaborate on his use of the word ``hopefully,'' and
further applauded the announcement by saying: ``It's a good omen
for progress.''
	   Abubakar, who has freed political prisoners since coming to
power in Africa's most populous country last June, made his
comments in a poignant setting: the island prison where President
Nelson Mandela spent most of his 27-year prison sentence.
	   Earlier Tuesday, Abubakar told parliament that military rule was
no longer acceptable in Nigeria.
	   ``We have now unequivocally chosen democracy as our preferred
option of governance,'' he said. ``Nigerians want nothing less than
true democracy in a
	   united and peaceful country.''
	   Abubakar arrived Tuesday on a first state visit to South Africa
by a Nigerian leader.
	   Abubakar's predecessor, Gen. Sani Abacha, died of a heart attack
in June,
	   ending five years of brutal rule and defiance of world
condemnation for usurping democratic elections.
	   Abubakar has pledged to return the country to civilian rule in
May next year and has promised elections in first quarter of the
year.
	   On his first offical overseas trip since taking power in
Africa's most populous state of 105 million people, Abubakar
expressed concern about regional flashpoints such as a border war
between Eritrea and Ethiopia and a rebellion in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo.
	   He said Nigeria and South Africa should form an axis of power to
promote peace and stability on the continent and strengthen
international groups like
	   the Organization of African Unity.
	   ``Relations between Nigeria and South Africa should always be
that of cooperation and not rivalry, concord and not disharmony,
friendship and not antagonism,'' he said ``We are the torchbearers
of the new Africa.''
	   Earlier Abubakar, choosing to don a bright blue gown instead of
a military uniform, walked into parliament with Deputy President
Thabo Mbeki, President Nelson Mandela's likely successor when he
steps down next year.

Rights group faults death sentence to 26 in Gandhi assassination
</HEADLINE>
case &QL;

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A human rights group said Tuesday the
judge who sentenced 26 people to death in the assassination of
former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi did not base his findings on
law.
	   The report of the independent People's Union for Democratic
Rights was made public a day after the Supreme Court began hearing
an appeal. The case will be heard by three justices later this
month.
	   The lower court judgment, handed down in January, was the
largest collective death sentence passed in India.
	   ``Our report seeks to highlight the dubious basis for the
imposition of the harshest penalty,'' Shashi Saxena, the group's
chairperson, said.
	   Gandhi was assassinated in 1991 while campaigning near the
southern city of Madras. A Sri Lankan suicide bomber detonated
explosives strapped to her waist.
	   The Tamil Tigers separatist group that is fighting for a
homeland in neighboring Sri Lanka was blamed for killing Gandhi. As
prime minister, he had sent Indian soldiers to Sri Lanka to help
the government crush the uprising. The Tigers denied killing
Gandhi.
	   The rights group said it neither supports nor opposes the
accused. ``We're only saying that the basis on which they were
convicted is flawed,'' Saxena said.
	   Even though only two persons were charged with murder, all 26
were held guilty of conspiring to kill Gandhi and sentenced to
death, regardless of the nature of their involvement.
	   A nurse who once treated the suicide bomber for a sprain and a
man who rented his house to the alleged assassins are among those
sentenced to die, Saxena said. The proof of conspiracy was based on
inference and not direct evidence, she said.
	   Even after 17 people retracted their statements _ they said
police tortured them to confess _ the judge accepted their
confessions as evidence, she said.
	   ``The entire story of motive, conspiracy revolves around the
confession. ... Even those who did not give such statements to the
police were found guilty on the basis of statements made by
others,'' Saxena said.
	   The group demanded that the evidence presented by police be
reexamined and a new trial be conducted under regular laws. The
previous trial was held under the much-criticized Terrorist and
Disruptive Activities Act, which granted wide leeway to law
enforcement agencies and was allowed to lapse.

Five journalists, 11 others sentenced to gallows

	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ A jammed courtroom listened in
hushed silence Tuesday as a High Court judge condemned 16
civilians, including five journalists, to death by hanging for
collaborating with Sierra Leone's ousted military regime.
	   Justice Edmond Cowan allowed the defendants 21 days to appeal
the sentences, which he handed down after lawyers for the condemned
made last-ditch appeals for leniency.
	   Friends and family members of the convicts did not respond as
the sentences were being read, but openly wept as the convicts were
led from the heavily-guarded High Court in Sierra Leone's capital
of Freetown.
	   The 16 were taken by police and West African intervention force
soldiers to Freetown's maximum security prison.
	   The ruling came just a day after a 12-member jury found the 16
guilty of helping the country's former military junta take power in
an armed coup d'etat last May.
	   The junta troops led by Lt. Col. Johnny Paul Koroma were
unseated in February by Nigerian-led West African troops, paving
the way for a return to power by President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah's
elected government.
	   The convicted journalists are former British Broadcasting
Corporation announcer Hilton Fyle, Sierra Leone state radio
executive Gipu Felix George, radio journalists Dennis Smith and
Olivia Mensah and newspaper editor Ibrahim Ben Kargbo.
	   Former junta spokesman Alieu Kamara was also among those
convicted.
	   The others include Sierra Leonean businessmen and government
bureaucrats. Two people were found not guilty and have been freed
from custody.
	   The convictions are the first under Kabbah's restored
government, which has pursued treason cases against at least 40
other civilians. Another 38 soldiers are being court martialled.
	   One of the country's foremost warlords, former rebel leader
Foday Sankoh, also faces charges for crimes against humanity.
	   Junta and allied rebel forces continue to kill, rape and maim
villagers as part of their campaign against the government and have
threatened mass killings in retaliation against the jailing of
Sankoh and other rebels.

	   ARKALYK, Kazakstan (AP) _ Three Russian cosmonauts, including a
former aide to President Boris Yeltsin, landed in the Kazak desert
on Tuesday after a flawless descent from the Mir space station.
	   The Soyuz TM-27 spacecraft touched down at 9:23 a.m. Moscow time
(0523 GMT) near the town of Arkalyk in north-central Kazakstan. It
carried crew commander Talgat Musabayev and his colleague Nikolai
Budarin, who spent 207 days on board the Mir, and former
presidential advisor Yuri Baturin, who spent 12 days there
performing scientific experiments.
	   The escape capsule sent clouds of dust rising from the Kazak
desert as it hit the ground. ``How are you feeling?'' Musabayev
asked Baturin after the cosmonauts climbed out of the craft.
``Great,'' Baturin said, giving a thumbs-up.
	   Russia has a 20-year lease agreement on the former Soviet
Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakstan and Russian cosmonauts also use
the Kazak steppe as their landing site.
	   Shortly after the landing, Yeltsin sent a telegram
congratulating the crew on a successful mission. ``The successful
completion of your mission is another bright page in the history of
our space research,'' he said.
	   Kazakstan's President Nursultan Nazarbayev met with the crew
shortly after the landing and wished them a speedy adaptation after
weightlessness.
	   ``We remember those days in March, when you risked your life
going into open space, making repairs. We worried about you,''
Nazarbayev told the cosmonauts.
	   The three cosmonauts were then flown to Star City, a cosmonauts
training center near Moscow, for a post-flight rehabilitation that
usually takes about a month.
	   Under a light rain in Moscow, the cosmonauts descended the
gangway to a military band and applause from a small crowd. Baturin
waved his cap to onlookers with a meek smile, looking a little
groggy after the trip.
	   One onlooker, prominent Russian cosmonaut Gennady Strekalov,
said Baturin's positive assessment of Mir would be valuable in
deciding whether to keep the aging station in orbit.
	   While on board Mir, Baturin called the station ``a huge home.''
The government plans to scrap the station next June.
	   ``The station is in excellent condition,'' Strekalov said,
adding that he thought it has another five years of life in it.
``Baturin confirmed that the station can work. Because he worked
with the president, his are valuable opinions.''
	   Cosmonauts Gennady Padalka and Sergei Avdeyev, who traveled to
the Mir with Baturin, remain aboard the space station and are
scheduled to return to Earth in February.

Struggling Flamengo fires coach
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Flamengo, mired in 13th place in
the national championship, has fired coach Joel Santana and
replaced him with Toninho Barroso of the club's junior team.
	   Santana's dismissal came following Sunday's 3-1 loss to modest
Juventude in Rio's Maracana Stadium. Flamengo has eight points,
nine behind co-leaders Corinthians and Santos.
	   Flamengo President Kleber Leite had promised to bring a top-name
coach to the club, and the choice of Barroso was widely met with
puzzlement.
	   Although little known to fans, Barroso coached Flamengo's junior
team to five state titles since 1992. He also led Brazil's under-20
national team to the title of the Toulon tournament in 1996 and to
second place in last year's South American championship.
	   Barroso, 42, is Flamengo's eighth coach since 1995.

Blair to recall Parliament to pass new anti-terror laws
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more Blair also proposing legislation to ban
conspiracy by British-based nationals of other countries, more
quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OMAGH, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Prime Minister Tony Blair,
standing at the spot where a bomb killed 28 people, said Tuesday
that he was recalling Parliament to enact new legislation intended
to lock up terrorists.
	   Blair said both houses of Parliament would be recalled on
Wednesday and Thursday next week, at the same time the Irish
Parliament meets in special session to debate similar steps.
	   Under the proposed laws, suspected bombers and gunmen could be
jailed for belonging to an illegal organization based on the
testimony of a police officer. A suspect's refusal to answer any
question during interrogation could be used as corroborating
evidence.
	   The government also will ask Parliament to pass legislation
making it an offense to conspire in Britain to commit terrorist
offenses in another country.
	   This legislation ``has been strongly pressed upon us by many
states who are concerned at what they believe to be U.K.-based
nationals of their countries using the U.K. to plan terrorist acts
abroad,'' Blair said.
	   The domestic anti-terrorist legislation would apply only to
specific organizations. Blair did not list them in his
announcement.
	   ``The days of the men of violence must be consigned to the past
where they belong,'' Blair said, standing at the crossroads bombed
on Aug. 15 by the so-called Real IRA, a splinter group which has
refused to join in the Irish Republican Army's cease-fire.
	   ``There is a clear need, now that it is plain that we are
dealing with this small, wholly unsupported, wholly
unrepresentative group of extremists, to tighten our law,'' Blair
said.
	   The special legislative sessions next week will come just before
U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to Northern Ireland and the
Republic of Ireland.
	   Sinn Fein, the IRA's political ally, said Blair's proposed
legislation was a ``massive overreaction'' that could jeopardize
the peace process.
	   ``The great danger in introducing these measures is that we
could have a situation developing which could have great and
serious implications for the peace agreement and Sinn Fein's role
within it,'' Martin McGuinness, Sinn Fein spokesman, said in a BBC
television interview.
	   Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern also has pledged new
anti-terrorist laws, and the Irish Parliament is expected to meet
in emergency session in Dublin starting Sept. 2.
	   The Irish and British legislation is aimed at dissident groups
who failed to endorse the Northern Ireland peace agreement accepted
by the Irish Republican Army and Sinn Fein. Those groups include
the Real IRA, which admitted it planted the Omagh bomb.
	   Until now, convicting people of membership of outlawed groups
has been extremely difficult. The groups keep no written records of
membership, senior members do not involve themselves directly in
perpetrating attacks, and potential civilian witnesses risk being
killed as informers.
	   McGuinness called Northern Ireland's predominantly Protestant
Royal Ulster Constabulary the most discredited police force in
Western Europe and said innocent people therefore could be jailed.
	   Also Tuesday, a Protestant paramilitary group, the Loyalist
Volunteer Force, offered to surrender weapons if its prisoners are
given early release.
	   The promise of paroles for members of truce-observing groups was
the most controversial part of the agreement struck in April among
the British and Irish governments and eight Northern Ireland
parties.
	   The hardline LVF, which declared its war over for good earlier
this month, promised a ``token act of decommissioning'' would take
place immediately if the government included its members in the
early releases.

Czechs have second thoughts about hosting US broadcasts to Iraq,
</HEADLINE>
Iran &QL; 
 &UR; By JAN SLIVA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ After terrorist bombings of U.S.
embassies in East Africa, the new Czech government is having second
thoughts about letting a U.S.-run radio station here beam special
programs to Iran and Iraq.
	   The United States had reached an agreement with the previous
center-right government of Prime Minister Josef Tosovsky for the
Prague-based Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty to broadcast a new
Farsi language service to Iran and an Arabic language ``Radio Free
Iraq'' by the new fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.
	   This month, however, a new center-left government under Prime
Minister Milos Zeman came to power. Government spokesman Libor
Roucek said the Cabinet will meet Wednesday to consider ``various
aspects'' of the programs.
	   ``Nobody has spoken to us about it yet,'' Roucek said of the
Iran and Iraq broadcasts. ``Before deciding on the fate of the
project, we must first get accurate information on all aspects of
the broadcast.''
	   During the Cold War, RFE/RL was popular among Czechs and others
in the Soviet bloc as an alternative to the Communist propaganda of
their own media. Now, however, many ordinary Czechs are nervous
that their country may end up drawn into the conflict if the
Iranian and Iraqi programs go on the air.
	   Czech concerns have increased since the Aug. 7 bombing of the
U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, which killed 257 people and
injured more than 5,000.
	   The United States blamed the attacks on an international
terrorist network under Saudi millionaire Osama bin Laden, and
launched cruise missile strikes on training camps in Afghanistan
and a pharmaceutical plant in Sudan in retaliation.
	   Jan Oberman, director of RFE/RL in Prague, refused comment on
the government's concerns but added, ``I can tell you we are
negotiating with the Czech government.''
	   Foreign Minister Jan Kavan told the newspaper Pravo that the
previous government ``agreed with RFE on these broadcasts, but on
condition that the first four months would be closely monitored to
see how balanced and objective they are,'' Kavan said.
	   Such broadcasts are popular with U.S. congressional
conservatives, who have seen them as a means of combating policies
of Tehran and Baghdad, which they feel threaten American foreign
policy interests.
	   The Clinton administration, which has been frustrated by Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein's defiance of U.N. weapons inspectors and
authoritarian rule, heartily backed the congressionally mandated
``Radio Free Iraq'' program.
	   But the White House balked at lawmakers' approval for starting a
``Radio Free Iran,'' fearing it could undermine efforts to rebuild
ties with Iran now that a relative moderate, Mohammad Khatami, is
president.
	   As a result, the Iran broadcasts are being referred to simply as
a new Farsi language service of RFE/RL, which began transmitting
behind the Iron Curtain and in the former Soviet Union during the
Cold War. The station moved from Munich, Germany, to Prague in 1995
after the fall of Communism.

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto
said her country's official policy of neutrality in the civil war
in neighboring Afghanistan may have been undermined by either
elements within its own security services or independent groups.
	   She called for an investigation into persistent accusations from
the United States, Iran, Russia and independent groups that
Pakistan is prolonging the Afghan civil war by supporting the
Taliban religious militia with arms and training. Pakistan has
offered official recognition to the Taliban, but says its supports
extends no further than that to the group close to putting all of
Afghanistan under their extreme form of Islamic rule.
	   ``Is it that the foreign policy decided at the political level
isn't being carried out at the ground level?'' Ms. Bhutto told
reporters in Islamabad. ``Are the allegations the rest of the world
is making true?''
	   She said Pakistani military intelligence or independent
religious groups may have helped the Taliban.
	   Both Ms. Bhutto, who was ousted in 1996 on charges of corruption
and mismanagement, and her successor Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif,
have said Pakistan's main interest is in peace and stability in
Afghanistan.
	   After years of internecine fighting and a war against Soviet
invaders in the 1980s, the Taliban have pledged to restore order in
Afghanistan. Their version of Islamic law bans women from work and
girls from school, and calls for punishing thieves by amputating
their right hands.

Czechs have second thoughts about hosting US broadcasts to Iraq,
</HEADLINE>
Iran
 &UR; By JAN SLIVA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ After terrorist bombings of U.S.
embassies in East Africa, the new Czech government is having second
thoughts about allowing a U.S.-run radio station here to beam
special programs to Iran and Iraq.
	   The United States had reached an agreement with the previous,
center-right government of Prime Minister Josef Tosovsky for the
Prague-based Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty to broadcast a new
Farsi language service to Iran and an Arabic language ``Radio Free
Iraq'' by the new fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.
	   This month, however, a new center-left government under Prime
Minister Milos Zeman came to power. Government spokesman Libor
Roucek said the Cabinet will meet Wednesday to consider ``various
aspects'' of the programs.
	   ``Nobody has spoken to us about it yet,'' Roucek said of the
Iran and Iraq broadcasts. ``Before deciding on the fate of the
project, we must first get accurate information on all aspects of
the broadcast.''
	   Jan Oberman, director of RFE/RL in Prague, refused comment on
the government's concerns but added, ``I can tell you we are
negotiating with the Czech government''
	   Foreign Minister Jan Kavan told the newspaper Pravo that that
the new Czech government has not received any formal request from
Washington to approve the broadcasts.
	   He indicated that the Czech government has reservations about
the plan.
	   ``As far as I know, the government of Prime Minister Tosovsky
agreed with RFE on these broadcasts, but on condition that the
first four months would be closely monitored to see how balanced
and objective they are,'' Kavan said.
	   Last week, Deputy Prime Minister Egon Lansky, one of the more
left-leaning members of the new government, said that such
broadcasts were a ``sensitive matter'' and that ``RFE can't do here
what they want.''
	   A spokesman for RFE/RL, Alena Fendrychova, declined comment on
the issue, saying ``we have an (information) embargo on the case.''
	   Such broadcasts are popular with congressional conservatives,
who have seen them as a means of combating policies of Tehran and
Baghdad which they feel threatened American foreign policy
interests.
	   The Clinton administration, which has been frustrated by Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein's defiance of U.N. weapons inspectors and
authoritarian rule, heartily backed the congressionally mandated
``Radio Free Iraq'' program.
	   But the White House balked at lawmakers' approval for starting a
``Radio Free Iran,'' fearing it could undermine efforts to rebuild
ties with Iran now that a relative moderate, Mohammad Khatami, is
president.
	   As a result, the Iran broadcasts are being referred to simply as
a new Farsi language service of RFE/RL, which began transmitting
behind the Iron Curtain and in the former Soviet Union during the
Cold War. The station moved from Munich, Germany, to Prague in 1995
after the fall of Communism.
	   Czech concerns have increased since the Aug. 7 bombing of the
U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, which killed 257 people and
injured more than 5,000.
	   The United States blamed the attacks on an international
terrorist network under Osama bin Laden, and launched cruise
missile strikes on training camps in Afghanistan and a
pharmaceutical plant in Sudan in retaliation.
	   During the Cold War, RFE/RL was popular among Czechs and others
in the Soviet Bloc as an alternative to the Communist propaganda of
their own media.
	   Now, however, many ordinary Czechs are nervous that their
country may end up drawn into the conflict if the Iranian and Iraqi
programs go on the air.
	   Last week, the Czech newspaper Slovo reported that an
unidentified man who owns a house near RFE/RL's new office in the
city's sixth district moved after learning of plans to broadcast
programs from the new location.
	   The man, who was not identified at his request, demanded that
RFE buy the house but later offered to rent it to RFE/RL employees.
The newspaper also quoted an employee at a kindergarten near the
station as saying it was ``irresponsible'' for the station to put
children at risk.

Spanish Flu research team exhumes unusable bodies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG MELLGREN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Scientists seeking to recover samples of one
of the world's deadliest viruses from frozen bodies in an Arctic
graveyard uncovered seven bodies Tuesday that were too decayed to
be useful.
	   It was not clear if the bodies were those of the seven Spanish
Flu victims whom the four-nation team of investigators believed
were buried beneath the permafrost in the graveyard on Norway's
Svalbard Archipelago.
	   The team hopes that finding frozen remnants of the virus, which
has otherwise disappeared, could help them figure out its genetic
profile, thereby potentially suggesting ways to develop vaccines
against other killer flus.
	   The Spanish Flu killed an estimated 20-40 million people
worldwide in 1918-19.
	   The search for the virus led investigators to Longyearbyen, the
Svalbards' capital about 950 kilometers (600 miles) from the North
Pole, where seven flu victims were buried. An examination of the
gravesite with ground-penetrating radar indicated they were buried
in the permafrost that begins about two meters (six feet) below the
surface.
	   However, the diggers on Tuesday came across coffins at a much
shallower depth than expected.
	   ``We were surprised,'' admitted Tom Bergan, a physician who is
the Norwegian coordinator of the team. ``All seven coffins were at
about 30 centimeters (12 inches).''
	   Bergan said several of the coffins had broken lids, and
contained human bones but no tissue from which samples could be
taken.
	   The ground-radar probes had indicated that the grave could
contain more bodies than the seven coal miners whose names are
given on markers.
	   ``We are going to continue digging through the permafrost all
the way to at least 2.5 meters (eight feet), Bergan said in Oslo.
``To give up the project now would be a big mistake,'' he said.
Bergan would not guess how long the digging would take.
	   The Spanish Flu was first reported at what is now Ft. Riley,
Kansas in late 1917 or early 1918. It spread to Europe with
American troops sent to fight in World War I and became a global
epidemic. Victims suffered a sudden fever, chills, headache,
malaise, muscle pain, pneumonia and rapid death.
	   Even if the team finds the frozen remains of the miners, they
say there is little risk of finding a living virus. But to play it
safe, the grave is covered with an inflatable tent, which has to be
entered through an air lock.
	   Researchers also wear isolation suits, breath outside air and
even take an experimental anti-viral drug.

Explosions kill at least 21 on three buses in Uganda

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Grenades or bombs exploded on three
long-distance buses in Uganda Tuesday, killing at least 21 people,
including a child, a private radio and a regional spokeswoman said.
	   Capital FM, a nationwide radio network, said explosions occurred
on buses heading for the Rwanda capital, Kigali, the northern town
of Gulu and Kasese in the west.
	   Police said they had no details but were trying to contact their
officers in the regions where the explosions occurred.
	   Mbarara district spokeswoman Tumwine A. said a grenade exploded
on the Kampala-to-Kigali bus owned by the Comesa Bus Co., and at
least 20 people were killed, either in the blast or when the bus
then collided with a mini-van outside Mbarara.
	   There was confusion over the number of dead. Capital FM put the
number at 30. The owner of the mini-van, whose name was not
immediately available, said all 16 passengers in his vehicle were
killed, and one passenger in the larger bus died.
	   The radio said there was another explosion in Lyantonde on a bus
headed for Kasese in western Uganda. Lyantonde is 214 kilometers
(133 miles) southwest of Kampala, also on the road to Mbarara.
	   There was no immediate information on casualties in the
Lyantonde explosion on the bus owned by the Bulangiti Bus Co.
	   The radio said a third explosion in a bus headed for Gulu killed
a child. The radio said the bus, belonging to the Otada Bus Co.,
had stopped in Nakasongola, 115 kilometers (71 miles) north of
Kampala because of mechanical problems, and all passengers except
the child got out. The explosion occurred shortly afterwards, and
the child was killed.
	   The radio said it appeared that the explosions were caused by
devices hidden in luggage stowed under the passenger section of the
buses.
	   In Mbarara, 282 kilometers (175 miles) southwest of Kampala,
workers at Mbarara Hospital said the injured began arriving around
11 a.m. (0800 GMT). At least 10 were admitted for treatment,
several in surgery, according to the hospital superintendent, who
would not give his name.
	   He said it was possible the number of dead was greater than the
number of injured.
	   ``We have not yet assessed whether it was the impact of the
explosion or of the collision,'' that caused most of the injuries,
the superintendent said.
	   Since the beginning of the year, grenade attacks on bars and
restaurants in Kampala have killed at least six people and injured
more than a dozen.
	   The government has blamed most of the attacks on rebels
belonging to the Allied Democratic Forces who usually stage attacks
in western Uganda around Kasese from bases inside the Democratic
Republic of Congo.
	   Sudan-based rebels of the Lord's Resistance Army have been
staging attacks and kidnapping children in northern Gulu district
for the past 12 years. International aid agencies estimate at least
250,000 people have been displaced by the attacks.
	   In Nov. 1997, police blamed a series of grenade attacks that
killed nine, including a prominent politician, on organized crime.

Portugal opposes Angolan rebels' break with peace monitoring

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Portugal insisted Tuesday that it, the
United States and Russia play a vital role in monitoring the
Angolan peace process and expressed optimism the African nation's
rebel group would reverse its decision to sever contacts with them.
	   The rebel group UNITA announced Monday it was cutting all ties
with the three observer countries accusing them of being biased
toward the Angolan government in implementing a U.N.-brokered 1994
peace accord that ended a two-decade civil war.
	   Cooperation with the observer nations was ``essential'' for the
Angolan peace process, the Portuguese Foreign Ministry said in a
statement.
	   UNITA ``surely will take this into consideration, strengthening
its collaboration with the United Nations rather than doing the
opposite,'' the statement said.
	   There was no official reaction to UNITA's announcement from
either the other observer countries or the U.N..
	   UNITA claimed the observers countries were acting in their own
economic interests in this oil- and diamond-rich country and
specifically accused Portugal, which ruled Angola up to its
independence in 1975, of having a ``colonial attitude.''
	   The U.N. Security Council has accused UNITA of dragging its feet
in implementing the peace deal and has imposed sanctions against
the group.
	   UNITA says it remains committed to the peace pact which has been
stymied by lingering hostility between the former foes. Its
implementation is more than a year behind schedule.

Angolan rebel group hints at support for Congo rebels
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Angola's former rebel group UNITA said
Tuesday it had interests to defend in neighboring Congo but stopped
short of openly acknowledging support for the insurrection against
President Laurent Kabila.
	   The Angolan government, which fought a two-decade civil war
against UNITA before the signing of a fragile 1994 peace accord, is
providing military support for Kabila against the insurgents _ a
coalition of ethnic Tutsi gunmen and disenchanted members of
Kabila's military.
	   ``UNITA cannot accept, for any reason, Angola's military
intervention'' in Congo, UNITA said in a statement from its
stronghold in Angola's central highlands and faxed to The
Associated Press in Lisbon.
	   ``If (the Angolan government) feels it has interests to defend
in the region, then let it be known that UNITA also has,'' the
statement warned.
	   A UNITA representative in Lisbon, Rui Oliveira, said his
movement could not provide military support to the Congolese rebels
because it had demobilized all its troops as part of the peace
accord.
	   However, the Angolan government claims that UNITA has some
25,000 troops hidden in the bush of the vast southwest African
country.
	   The entry of Angola, a former Portuguese colony, into Congo's
civil war may be driven by government concerns that Kabila's
departure could usher in a new administration that is sympathetic
to UNITA.
	   Angola last year helped Kabila oust President Mobutu Sese Seko,
the long-time ruler of then-Zaire and an ally of UNITA leader Jonas
Savimbi.
	   In return, Kabila agreed to cut off UNITA's supply lines across
the two countries' long and porous border. The supply routes had
allowed UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola _ to smuggle out diamonds and bring in
military equipment, according to the government.

Researcher wants financial support in return for diary pages
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with background on Suijk's work,
reaction in Netherlands. &QL; 
 &UR; By WILLIAM J. KOLE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ In the dry and dignified realm of
World War II research, it's the closest thing to a hostage
standoff.
	   A leading Anne Frank expert who's been holding five missing
pages of her famed diary for 18 years has agreed to turn them over.
But there's a big ``if'' _ the Dutch institute fighting to get them
back and publish them must agree to donate the proceeds to his own
Holocaust awareness crusade in the United States.
	   The Netherlands State Institute for War Documentation, which
revealed the existence of the missing pages last week, expressed
astonishment Tuesday at the televised demands from former Anne
Frank Foundation employee Cornelis Suijk.
	   ``We've asked a lawyer to try to find a way out of this,'' said
David Barnouw, spokesman for the war documentation center.
	   ``I'm a little surprised,'' he added.
	   Suijk claims that Otto Frank, father of the young Jewish diarist
whose harrowing account of hiding from the Nazis has become an
international best-seller in 55 languages, gave him the pages
shortly before his death in 1980.
	   Suijk, 74, a longtime Anne Frank Foundation financial adviser
and close personal friend and confidante of Otto Frank, told RTL4
television Monday evening that the elder Frank made him promise the
pages wouldn't be published until the entire family was dead.
	   Suijk told the station he's the ``rightful owner'' of the pages
and that he's willing to part with them only if the war
documentation institute in turn agrees to use the proceeds from
their publication to support his own research.
	   The institute, which wants the pages back so they can be
included in the next edition of ``The Diary of Anne Frank,''
contends that Otto Frank never intended to make a gift of them to
Suijk.
	   Suijk is now international director of the New York-based Anne
Frank Center USA, a sister organization of the Amsterdam
foundation. He speaks on the Holocaust to schools, universities and
community groups around the United States and coordinates a
traveling Anne Frank exhibition.
	   He did not immediately return phone calls seeking comment
Tuesday. But a former colleague defended both Suijk and his
scholarship.
	   ``He is beyond a shadow of a doubt a man of integrity,'' Gerrold
van der Stroom, a co-editor of ``The Diary of Anne Frank _ The
Critical Edition,'' told the daily De Volkskrant.
	   The affair has become the talk of the town in the Netherlands,
where the Amsterdam canal house where Anne and her family hid in a
secret annex behind a movable bookcase is a top tourist attraction.
	   ``The word is out: Cor Suijk wants to see money,'' the respected
NRC Handelsblad daily reported Tuesday.
	   The war documentation center, citing the diary copyright held by
the Basel, Switzerland-based Anne Frank Fund, has said only that
the handwritten pages appear to be authentic and contain Anne's
``very critical'' assessment of her parents' marriage.
	   Suijk said their contents will be revealed Sept. 14 in a Dutch
documentary he helped produce about Anne's two years in hiding. If
so, that could touch off another debate over who has rights to
publish her writings.
	   The revelation that there are pages missing from Anne's diary
has startled scholars who have spent decades researching her life
and were convinced they'd published the complete journal.
	   It trails off in August 1944, just before the Franks were
betrayed and Anne was arrested and hauled off to the Bergen-Belsen
concentration camp. Starving and freezing, Anne died there of
typhoid in the spring of 1945, just weeks before the camp was
liberated.
	   Her diary, a modern literary classic that has become required
reading in schools worldwide, has inspired numerous books, films
and a hit Broadway play.

Taliban official says letter received from United States
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DONNA BRYSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ A spokesman for Afghanistan's Taliban
rulers said the religious militia received a letter Tuesday from
the United States, opening communications after Washington launched
missile attacks on what it said was a terrorist training camp in
eastern Afghanistan.
	   Spokesman Maulvi Ahmet Wakil, reached on satellite telephone in
the southern Afghan city of Kandahar, said he did not know the
contents of the letter and had few other details.
	   The United States has no diplomatic representative in the
Taliban-controlled Afghan capital of Kabul. But both Washington and
the Taliban have representatives in neighboring Pakistan, and the
Taliban have an observer at the United Nations, where the United
States has an ambassador.
	   In the Pakistani capital of Islamabad, U.S. Embassy spokesman
Richard Hoagland refused to comment on reports the United States
has made overtures to the Taliban since the Aug. 20 missile
attacks. But Hoagland said the United States was always open to
talks with the Taliban, and ``have had ongoing conversations with
the Taliban since 1994.''
	   Tuesday's report came after the Taliban distanced themselves
somewhat from Osama bin Laden, the man Washington says ran the camp
it struck last week, killing at least 27 people. The United States
said it acted after determining bin Laden was behind U.S. Embassy
bombings that killed 257 people earlier this month.
	   Sunday, Taliban officials said bin Laden's movements were being
restricted for his own protection, and supreme Taliban leader
Mullah Omar was quoted as expressing displeasure with reported
statements from bin Laden that called for Muslims to strike at the
United States. The BBC reported Monday that bin Laden had agreed he
will refrain from political or military activity while in
Afghanistan, a pledge the Taliban repeatedly said he made even
before the embassy bombings.
	   The Taliban are clearly worried that they cannot control the man
they call an honored guest. But after the U.S. missile strikes
sparked large and violent anti-American, pro-bin Laden protests
across Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, it appeared unlikely they
would completely disown him.
	   Nonetheless, the official Taliban response to the strikes has
been muted, perhaps because they are undecided about their position
on bin Laden. Omar has said bin Laden would not be handed over,
while Taliban envoys at the United Nations have said they would be
willing to discuss such a solution if the United States could prove
terrorism charges against him.
	   The U.N. envoys are more exposed to international opinion at a
time when the Taliban are seeking recognition and a U.N. seat. To
Westerners like U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, bin
Laden is a symbol of the Taliban's unwillingness to fight
terrorism. Albright told reporters recently that the Taliban could
show its desire to be part of the international community by not
harboring ``terrorist elements.''
	   The basic themes of U.S.-Taliban contacts since the religious
militia appeared in 1994 have been terrorism; the need for a
peaceful settlement to the Afghan civil war; the battle to stamp
out Afghanistan's thriving heroin production industry; and the
Taliban record of denying basic rights to women and minorities.
	   Bin Laden was a hero of the Afghan war against Soviet invaders
in the 1980s, leading hundreds of fellow Saudis and other Arabs who
came to help their fellow Muslims fight a regime seen as the enemy
of all religion. He later turned his determined hatred against the
United States, which he has accused of desecrating Muslim holy
sights, backing corrupt regimes in predominately Arab countries,
and helping Israel humiliate the Arab world.

	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ China has freed a bishop in the underground
Catholic church but ordered him to stop operating a orphanage, the
Vatican's missionary news service reported Tuesday.
	   The Chinese government says the foundling home is illegal
because Bishop Julius Jia Zhiguo operates outside of the
state-approved church system, the Fides news service said.
	   The orphanage at Zhengding, 250 kilometers (155 miles) southwest
of Beijing, cares for about 100 mentally and physically handicapped
children, many of them abandoned by their parents, Fides said.
	   Jia was arrested June 16 to keep him from contacting President
Clinton during the American leader's visit that month and
reappeared at his home at Zhengding earlier this month, Fides said.
	   The underground Roman Catholic church remains loyal to the
Vatican in defiance of Beijing.

Georgian officials condemn bombing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Georgia's No. 2 leader on Tuesday
denounced an explosion in a regional administration building as an
attempt to destabilize the divided country.
	   A 21-year-old woman and a 16-month-old baby were killed Monday
when a bomb exploded in a four-story building in the town of
Zugdidi, near the border with breakaway Abkhazia. More than 30
other people were injured.
	   ``Yesterday's blast in Zugdidi aims to destabilize the situation
in the region and the republic as a whole, including (capital)
Tbilisi,'' State Minister Vazha Lordkipanidze told reporters.
	   The bomb exploded shortly after noon in a building that houses
the regional government, the mayor's office and several other
administrative institutions.
	   Security Minister Dzhemal Gakhokidze said investigators suspect
Abkhazian separatists or Georgian opponents of President Eduard
Shevardnadze of staging the blast.
	   The explosion occurred on the three-year anniversary of
Georgia's Constitution, which the president's opponents call
``Shevardnadze's constitution.''
	   More than 30 victims remained hospitalized Tuesday, five of them
in serious condition, said Health Minister Aftandil Dzhorbenadze.
Three of the injured were flown to Tbilisi late Monday night for
intensive care, he said.
	   No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack.
Shevardnadze has denounced it as an act of terrorism.
	   Security remained tightened Tuesday in street markets, the post
office and other administration buildings in Zugdidi.
	   The region has been plagued by violence since Abkhazia's
13-month war for independence ended in 1993. Sporadic clashes
between separatists and forces loyal to Georgia's central
government have also continued, despite the Russian peacekeepers
stationed in the region.

Sudan demands U.S. evidence that factory made nerve agents
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JAMAL HALABY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ The United States must produce
``convincing evidence'' to justify its claim that a Sudanese
factory produced precursors for chemical weapons, Sudan's
information minister said Tuesday.
	   Ghazi Salah el-Din spoke at a news conference called to respond
to U.S. allegations that soil samples obtained secretly from the
Khartoum factory contained material used in manufacturing nerve
gas.
	   ``They have not produced any convincing evidence,'' Salah el-Din
said.
	   U.S. President Clinton ordered a cruise missile attack against
the Al-Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries Co. last Thursday. Sudan
says the factory produced medicine.
	   The attack came at the same time as U.S. strikes against
extremist camps in Afghanistan and were in retaliation for the Aug.
7 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   A U.S. intelligence official said Monday that a key factor in
ordering the strike was a soil sample from the plant site that
showed traces of a manmade chemical that is a key ingredient in the
deadly nerve agent VX.
	   ``We have to be satisfied that the United States is not making
this up,'' Salah el-Din said. ``It's not enough to produce soil
which could have been made up in the United States itself, and to
claim that the soil contains toxic agents.''
	   ``For a factory to produce toxic agents, you need special
facilities, special preparations, special storage areas and
preparations facilities, '' he added.
	   Sudan has called on the United Nations to send a team of experts
to inspect the factory.
	   ``You can't keep things to yourself and keep claiming you have
the final proof without allowing people to verify your claims,'' he
said.
	   President Omar el-Bashir told The Associated Press on Monday
that Sudan has also demanded that the United States publicly
apologize for the strike and compensate the country for damages
estimated at dlrs 100 million.
	   El-Bashir said that Britain, which strongly supported the strike
against the factory, was asked to scale down its diplomatic
representation in Khartoum from ambassador level to charge
d'affaires.
	   In the news conference, Salah el-Din indicated that there was
room for maneuvering with Britain.
	   ``If we find a settlement to the present conflict, it's likely
that things may stay the way they were and we can think of
discussing the future relations between Sudan and the United
Kingdom in an amicable manner,'' he said.
	   But, he added, ``if things deteriorate, God forbid, I don't see
any way out of this dilemma.''

Sudan's elderly abandoned as famine worsens
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THIET, Sudan (AP) _ More than 150 frail old men and women wait
impatiently beneath a blazing sun for a handout that could spare
them from starvation.
	   Finally, two women emerge from a mud hut bearing a huge pot
steaming with energy-enriched porridge that clearly won't feed
everyone. Turmoil breaks out.
	   Weak but determined, the hungry Sudanese struggle to grab a
share of the lumpy white cereal until security guards beat them
back with sticks.
	   An old man falls to his knees, raises his arms and begs:
``Please, give me some food.''
	   He gets nothing but harsh words from the guards.
	   ``When starvation is around, it's survival of the fittest,''
says Jenny Kinsingular, who works as a health team leader in the
World Vision feeding center in Thiet, nearly 1,000 kilometers (625
miles) southwest of Khartoum.
	   As the Sudan's famine deepens, many families are abandoning
their elderly _ a disturbing trend in a culture where old people
are traditionally respected for their wisdom and lifetime
achievements.
	   ``The noose is being tightened, and sometimes the doors of huts
are being slammed even on kinship ties,'' said Brenda Barton,
spokeswoman for the World Food Program.
	   Food has long been a key weapon in Sudan's destructive 15-year
civil war, fought mainly in the south.
	   The Sudan People's Liberation Army is battling a government
dominated by northern Arabs. They seek more autonomy for black
southerners, who are mostly Christians or members of tribal faiths.
	   The United States regards the regime of Sudanese President Omar
el-Bashir as one of the world's key promoters of international
terrorism.
	   Last week, U.S. missiles struck a Sudanese factory that U.S.
President Bill Clinton said manufactured chemical weapons. It was
retaliation for the bombing of two U.S. embassies in East Africa.
Sudan insists the plant made only medicines.
	   While most aid flights are still supplying southern Sudan, the
German government indefinitely postponed plans to send four cargo
planes to deliver food to hungry northerners.
	   This year, a drought followed in some areas by flooding is
turning into a killer famine, fueled by enemy raiders who burn
meager crops and donated food and fighting that has displaced
millions.
	   An estimated 2.5 million Sudanese are going hungry, all but
200,000 of them in the south, Barton said. Donors have given dlrs
128 million for food aid, but another dlrs 26 million will be
needed through April, she said.
	   Much of the food is dropped from the air by huge cargo planes.
At least 11,000 tons rains down on southern Sudan each month, but
that's 4,000 tons short of what is needed, says John Hayes, manager
of Operation Lifeline Sudan.
	   U.N. agencies have been delivering food to Sudan's hungry for
almost 30 years. With war still being waged, Hayes doesn't expect
to the need to subside any time soon.
	   ``In one year, we will have the same talk,'' Hayes said at his
base of Lokichokio, in northwestern Kenya, where another cargo
plane was growling to a start, its belly full of desperately needed
food.

Israeli helicopter strike kills guerrilla in south Lebanon

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli helicopters hunted down and killed
a guerrilla commander and warplanes blasted suspected militant
hideouts Tuesday as fighting escalated in southern Lebanon,
security officials said.
	   Israeli television reported that the slain commander, Hossam
al-Amin, was second-in-command of the military faction of Shiite
Amal, the pro-Syrian party led by Lebanon's speaker of parliament,
Nabih Berri.
	   ``Al-Amin was personally responsible for the planning and
execution of many terrorist acts by Amal against the Israeli
Defense Force and the (allied) South Lebanon Army,'' an Israeli
military spokesman said in Jerusalem.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai warned of possible
retaliation.
	   ``We will continue to fight against terrorists and their leaders
who attack us and I wouldn't put it past the other side to carry
out retaliatory attacks,'' Mordechai told reporters.
	   Guerrillas detonated a roadside bomb that killed a militiaman of
the Israeli-backed SLA near Jezzine, a town 30 kilometers (20
miles) north of the Israeli border, the officials said.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the
attack.
	   Israel retaliated with an artillery bombardment and an air
strike on suspected guerrilla hideouts in the mountains around
Jezzine, officials said, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   Shells exploded in the town of Mashghara and the village of
Sohmor, which both lie about two kilometers (one mile) outside the
Israeli-occupied zone. A car was set ablaze and several houses were
damaged.
	   Six Lebanese civilians, including a six-year-old boy, were
injured in the shelling and one Hezbollah guerrilla was hurt in the
air raid, the officials said.
	   Tuesday's fighting marked a sharp rise in tensions that have
been building steadily since last week, when three Israeli soldiers
were killed in two guerrilla attacks.
	   In the raid that killed the commander, two Israeli
helicopter-gunships flew in from the sea and attacked a car, a blue
BMW sedan, as it was driving along a coastal road about 15
kilometers (10 miles) north of the Israeli border and only about
one kilometer (mile) from a checkpoint of U.N. peacekeepers.
	   Security officials said a single rocket hit the car and killed
al-Amin, 31. The blast threw the vehicle about 10 meters (yards)
from the road.
	   A spokesman for Amal acknowledged the killing, but declined to
give al-Amin's rank.
	   It was the first time in six years that Israel has used
helicopter gunships to kill a marked man. In 1992 Israeli
helicopters blasted a motorcade of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah
group, killing its secretary general, Sheik Abbas Musawi.
	   Israel has previously used helicopter gunships to hunt down
commanders of Shiite guerrillas who are waging a war to dislodge
Israeli troops and the SLA militia from the occupied zone.

Kabila returns to capital, plans attacks in Congo's east

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Fortified by the support of allied troops
and air support, President Laurent Kabila returned with fanfare to
Congo's capital Tuesday while the government prepared to strike at
the heart of rebel-held territory in the east.
	   Kabila's motorcade _ a caravan of black limousines flanked by
pickup trucks filled with commandos _ zipped through Kinshasa's
rutted streets past cheering and waving crowds. Kabila had been
away from the city for more than week.
	   His return came as allied warplanes from Angola and Zimbabwe
staged a series of attacks on rebel positions, Information Minister
Didier Mumengi said. He declined to give details.
	   In eastern Congo, rebel officials said Angolan and Zimbabwean
aircraft had bombed the rebel-held city of Kisangani and the town
of Kasangulu, 30 kilometers (15 miles) south of Kinshasa.
	   Bizima Karaha, a top rebel official, said the planes had bombed
civilian targets in Kisangani, Congo's third-largest city. The city
was captured by rebels in recent days.
	   ``They cannot recapture Kisangani, only bomb it from the air,''
he said. ``This is terrorism.''
	   A string of victories by Congolese soldiers and their Angolan
allies in the western corridor that stretches from Kinshasa to the
Atlantic Ocean have put the rebels on the defensive.
	   In the wake of those gains, the government said it is planning
on moving east into rebel areas.
	   ``The Congolese army and our allies are looking for the same
victories in the east,'' Voice of the People radio reported.
	   Amid the threat of fighting shifting to the east, Roman Catholic
Church officials in Rome said Tutsi rebels in eastern Congo had
attacked a Catholic mission crowded with war refugees, killing 37
people.
	   A priest, three nuns and a seminary student died alongside 32
refugees, the Vatican's missionary news service reported. The
attack happened Sunday in the remote parish of Kasika, about 80
kilometers northwest of Uvira in South Kivu province.
	   The rebels attacked because they suspected local people of
giving food to a pro-government militia, the news service said.
	   All the dead were Congolese.
	   In southwestern Congo, meanwhile, Angolan forces fighting on
behalf of Kabila have re-captured a string of towns the rebels had
taken, reportedly including the Congo River port of Matadi _ though
rebel officials deny the town has fallen.
	   Rebel fighters _ a coalition of ethnic Tutsi gunmen and
disenchanted members of Kabila's military _ were holed up in the
town of Inga, Angolan radio reported.
	   Inga, about 50 kilometers north of Matadi, is the site of a
major power dam that supplies Kinshasa with electricity.
	   The rebels in the west are now trapped between Angolan forces in
the southwest and Zimbabwean troops defending Kinshasa's southern
outskirts.
	   In Namibia, newspapers indicated that country may also be
preparing to enter the conflict on the government's behalf.
	   The dailies Die Republikein and The Namibian reported that a
column of about a dozen armored vehicles was moving troops north
toward Zambia and Angola _ both of which border Congo.
	   Namibian President Sam Nujoma last week supported a decision by
Zimbabwe, Zambia and Angola to support Kabila's against the
insurrection.
	   Rwanda _ considered the rebels' main military and political
sponsor _ says it will intervene in the conflict if the Zimbabweans
and Angolans do not withdraw.
	   Uganda has also sent troops and tanks in support of the
insurgents.
	   Fighting broke out earlier this month when members of Kabila's
armed forces revolted after the president ordered all Rwandan
troops out of the country.
	   The Rwandan soldiers _ the core of Kabila's rebel movement that
ousted Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko last _ had stayed on in
Congo as part of the national defense force.
	   The government on Monday rejected a cease-fire plan drafted in
South Africa by member states of the Southern African Development
Community. Kabila insists a cease-fire can come only after Rwandan
and Ugandan forces leave Congo.
	   In Kinshasa, the government released a Worldwide Television News
crew that had been detained for several days.
	   Journalists in Kinshasa have been repeatedly detained and
harassed by authorities, who accuse the Western media of a
pro-rebel bias.

Tender for Ionian Bank annulled
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with statement from Commercial bank, recasts lead &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece's Commercial Bank on Tuesday
annulled the tender for the sale of a 51 percent stake in Ionian
Bank, Greece's fourth largest, after the two bids were found to be
unsatisfactory.
	   Commercial is the parent bank of Ionian.
	   ``The bank's board decided to reject all bids submitted which
for various reasons were unsatisfactory,'' said George Mihelis, the
Commercial Bank's managing director. ``The process for the sale
will be repeated within three months at the latest.''
	   The bank did not explain why the bids were unsatisfactory.
	   National Economy and Finance Minister Yannos Papantoniou also
said a new tender will take place within three months.
	   Ionian is the largest bank to be privatized and a key element in
the socialist government's effort to meet targets for participation
in the European Union's single currency by 2001.
	   But government spokesman Dimitris Reppas stressed that the
tender's failure would not affect the country's economy. ``The
course of our country's economy is steady, it is positive and
rising. It is not connected to the sale of a medium bank,'' he
said.
	   Three bids were submitted for the bank Monday, with the highest
submitted by U.S. law firm Jan Morton Heger representing an unknown
American consortium offering dlrs 1.12 billion.
	   An Italian-American holding company called Exchange Finance
Overseas offered dlrs 1 billion.
	   Greek billionaire Spyros Latsis' Eurobank group, one of the
favorites for purchasing Ionian, submitted a bid far below the
bank's current stock market value of 250 billion drachmas (dlrs 825
million).
	   Eurobank offered 135.6 billion drachmas (dlrs 447 million) for
Ionian, despite statements by Papantoniou that the tender could be
annulled if offers fell far below Ionian's stock market value.
	   The stock market's general index slid to close 3.6 percent down
following Monday's news of a decision on the Ionian sale being
delayed. But the exchange had closed when the tender's annulment
was announced.
	   The government's plans to privatize Ionian prompted violent
reactions from the bank's staff in May, leading to a six-week
strike by employees seeking to maintain benefits and the guarantee
of a job until the retirement age of 62.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Paris prosecutors issued a rare statement Tuesday
in the Princess Diana case, saying the investigation would conclude
in October.
	   The statement, which detailed the status of the investigation,
revealed no new breaks in the case, which is now nearly a year old.
	   ``The investigations ordered by the judge should be completed at
the end of October,'' the statement said.
	   It came in late afternoon, just after two key witnesses had been
questioned by Judge Herve Stephan: the president of the Ritz Hotel
and his assistant.
	   It was the first time Stephan had questioned Ritz management
about the car crash last Aug. 31 that killed Diana, her boyfriend
Dodi Fayed and driver Henri Paul shortly after they left the hotel.

	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Scientists seeking to recover samples of one
of the world's deadliest viruses from frozen bodies in an Arctic
graveyard on Tuesday uncovered seven bodies too decayed to be
useful.
	   It was not clear if the bodies were those of the seven Spanish
Flu victims whom the four-nation team of investigators believed
were buried beneath the permafrost in the graveyard on Norway's
Svalbard Archipelago.
	   The team hopes that finding frozen remnants of the virus, which
has otherwise disappeared, could help them figure out its genetic
profile, thereby potentially suggesting ways to develop vaccines
against other killer flus.
	   The Spanish Flu killed an estimated 20-40 million people
worldwide in 1918-19.
	   The search for the virus led investigators to Longyearbyen, the
Svalbards' capital about 950 kilometers (600 miles) from the North
Pole, where seven flu victims were buried. An examination of the
gravesite with ground-penetrating radar indicated they were buried
in the permafrost that begins about two meters (six feet) below the
surface.
	   However, the diggers on Tuesday came across coffins at a much
shallower depth than expected.
	   ``We were surprised,'' admitted Tom Bergan, a physician who is
the Norwegian coordinator of the team. ``All seven coffins were at
about 30 centimeters (12 inches).''
	   Bergan said several of the coffins had broken lids, and
contained human bones but no tissue from which samples could be
taken.
	   The ground-radar probes had indicated that the grave could
contain more bodies than the seven coal miners whose names are
given on markers.
	   ``We are going to continue digging through the permafrost all
the way to at least 2.5 meters (eight feet), Bergan said in Oslo.
``To give up the project now would be a big mistake,'' he said.
Bergan would not guess how long the digging would take.
	   The Spanish Flu was first reported at what is now Ft. Riley,
Kansas in late 1917 or early 1918. It spread to Europe with
American troops sent to fight in World War I and became a global
epidemic. Victims suffered a sudden fever, chills, headache,
malaise, muscle pain, pneumonia and rapid death.
	   Even if the team finds the frozen remains of the miners, they
say there is little risk of finding a living virus. But to play it
safe, the grave is covered with an inflatable tent, which has to be
entered through an air lock.
	   Researchers also wear isolation suits, breath outside air and
even take an experimental anti-viral drug.

German central bank head says financial crises having effect
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STAVANGER, Norway (AP) _ The head of Germany's central bank,
Hans Tietmeyer, said Tuesday that the financial crises in Asia and
Russia are leaving ``skid marks all over international economic
growth.''
	   ``It is no doubt also true that the crises haven't yet been
overcome, and that the full dimensions of the consequences aren't
yet manifest,'' the Bundesbank head said at an international
conference for the oil industry in Stavanger. Norway's main oil
town.
	   Russia's economic troubles do not have the same worldwide
economic impact as the Asian financial crisis, but are important
for Europe, he said.
	   ``A far-reaching reform of economic and fiscal policy in general
appears to be essential,'' Tietemeyer said.
	   In discussing the global impact of the current regional crises,
Tietmeyer warned that ``there must be no danger of other countries
_ such as those in Latin America _ becoming infected.''
	   Nonetheless, ``a global recession is not at the moment knocking
at the door,'' he said

French petroleum giant pulls out of Russian alliance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The French petroleum company Elf Aquitaine said
Tuesday it had decided to abandon a proposed alliance with Russia's
Sibneft due to economic instability in Russia and low world oil
prices.
	   ``In recent weeks, Elf has become increasingly concerned about
the continuing volatile investment climate worldwide, particularly
in Russia ... Elf has terminated the current negotiations,'' Elf
said in a statement.
	   Last week, Elf said its plans to invest more than dlrs 500
million in Sibneft were ``on hold.''
	   However, the company did not rule out future cooperation, saying
the two groups would continue to look into other options.
	   Tuesday's withdrawal marks Elf's second major setback in Russia
this year.
	   In March, Elf announced plans to take a 5 percent stake, valued
at dlrs 528 million, in a newly formed company to be called Yuksi,
the result of a merger between Sibneft and another Russian oil
company, Yukos.
	   The new venture failed to materialize, and Elf had since been
negotiating to take a 12 percent stake in Sibneft.

Eritrea allows 550 Ethiopians to return home
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ Eritrea has allowed another 530
Ethiopian nationals to leave for home after repeated appeals made
since the neighbors began fighting three months ago, Ethiopia said.
	   Government spokeswoman Selome Tadesse said in a statement
Tuesday that 400 Ethiopians were allowed to return from the
Eritrean-controlled port of Assab and another 130 from the Eritrean
capital of Asmara on Sunday.
	   Ethiopia says virtually all its nationals are desperate to leave
Eritrea because most have been fired from their jobs and evicted
from their homes, particularly in Asmara.
	   The Ethiopians leaving from Assab had to pass through the rough
border town of Bure, where the armies of the two countries are
massed and dug in. Those leaving Asmara passed through the Zala
Ambessa area, where the two armies are also facing off.
	   The government spokeswoman, quoting the new arrivals, said 1,000
Ethiopians had recently demonstrated in Asmara, demanding to leave
for home.
	   An estimated 30,000 Ethiopians were reported left jobless in
Assab port, where activity abruptly ceased with the outbreak of
hostilities three months ago. Since then, Ethiopia began using the
Djibouti port for all imports and exports.
	   Ethiopia blames Eritrea's invasion of two districts on the
western end of the 960-kilometer (600-mile) border between the East
African countries in early May for precipitating the crisis.
	   Eritrea, which claims rights to the disputed areas under
colonial-era agreements, gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993.

No harm found in children of women who ate lots of mercury-tainted
</HEADLINE>
fish &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: Hold for release at 2000 GMT. &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL A. DRISCOLL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Children whose mothers ate lots of ocean fish
containing low levels of mercury while they were pregnant suffered
no ill effects in a study conducted in the Indian Ocean country of
Seychelles.
	   ``These are people who eat fish 12 times a week, and we have not
found any negative effects yet,'' said Dr. Gary J. Myers, professor
of pediatrics and neurology at the University of Rochester.
	   The study was published in Wednesday's Journal of the American
Medical Association.
	   At elevated levels, mercury can be dangerous for humans and can
cause severe neurological damage in unborn children. Fish are
contaminated with mercury to different degrees throughout the
world.
	   In the Seychelles, where 85 percent of the population eats fish
every day, mercury contamination levels are comparable to those in
the U.S. market.
	   The researchers tested the pregnant women for mercury levels in
their bodies, then followed the development of 711 children until
age 5 1/5. No adverse effects were found in a battery of tests in
such areas as language, reading, arithmetic, spatial skills and
social abilities.
	   An Environmental Protection Agency study last year also found no
reason to fear mercury in commercially bought fish in the United
States.
	   Both the EPA and the researchers in the Seychelles study pointed
out, however, that freshwater fish in the United States are a
different story. Many of these fish are much more highly
contaminated with mercury and PCBs.
	   The Food and Drug Administration limits the amount of mercury
allowed in fish sold in stores and restaurants.
	   Dr. Michael Bolger, an FDA toxicologist, said the size and
duration of the Seychelles study make it an important contribution
to the issue, ``but I don't want to leave the impression that this
is the last word.''
	   The Seychelles children are now being retested at age 8.
	   In an accompanying editorial, EPA researcher Kathryn R. Mahaffey
said more sensitive tests of child development are needed before
firm conclusions can be drawn.
	   But Myers said the tests in the study were the most
sophisticated available and are commonly used in research on child
development.

Track cycling championships begin

 &UR; Eds: Updates with blood controls taken &QL; 
 &UR; By SALVATORE ZANCA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) - After the doping scandal plagued the
Tour de France, the attention in cycling now shifts to the World
Championships starting Wednesday where the bulky track sprinters
already have known problems with steroids and disqualifications in
the past.
	   The International Cycling Union will be under scrutiny to see
how it will handle the doping problem in the first major
international competition organized by the UCI since the Tour de
France.
	   The championships had not officially begun before the first step
was taken. According to a UCI spokesman, there were 23 blood
controls taken from members of the French, German and Ukraine team
Tuesday morning at the teams' hotels. All were negative.
	   There are 12 titles up for grabs with most concentrating on the
sprints where bursts of speeds are necessary -- and could be helped
by performance-enhancing drugs.
	   Well before the doping scandal on the route of the Tour de
France, there were already problems with doping at the world
championships on the track.
	   In 1991, the first and third placers in the sprint event were
found to have steroids in their system and had to give up their
medals. Carey Hall and Stephen Pate were suspended. The title is
listed as vacant in the records of the championship.
	   The French team will do its part to make the cycling world
forget its problems with another stellar team. At last year's
championships in Perth, Australia, France took exactly half the
titles, capturing 6 of 12.
	   Led by its stars, Florian Rousseau and Felicia Ballanger, France
hopes to do well again. Rousseau is looking to defend his title
against in the sprint event as well as helping his team in the
Olympic sprint event.
	   Rousseau might even add another gold with a chance in the
individual pursuit. He recently beat his teammate --- and defending
world champion -- Philippe Ermenault -- at the national
championships in that event.
	   Australia, with three-time kilometer champion Shane Kelly, and
Germany, with the nucleus of its World Cup team, will also
challenge for titles.
	   In the women's events, Ballanger has won two titles for the last
three years. She has won the 500-meter time trial and the
individual sprint in 1995 at Bogota, Colombia, 1996 at Manchester,
England and 1997 at Perth.
	   Her rivalry with Australia's Michelle Ferris was one of the
highlights of over the past three years.
	   The competition starts with two finals on Wednesday -- the men's
kilometer time trial and the men's individual pursuit. The events
last until Sunday.
	   The road championships -- where France won three titles last
year -- will be in the Netherlands in October.

Sudan demands U.S. evidence that factory made nerve agents
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JAMAL HALABY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ The United States must produce
``convincing evidence'' to justify its claim that a Sudanese
factory produced precursors for chemical weapons, Sudan's
information minister said Tuesday.
	   Ghazi Salah el-Din spoke at a news conference called to respond
to U.S. allegations that soil samples obtained secretly from the
Khartoum factory contained material used in manufacturing nerve
gas.
	   ``They have not produced any convincing evidence,'' Salah el-Din
said.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton ordered a cruise missile attack
against the Al-Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries Co. last Thursday.
Sudan says the factory produced medicine.
	   The Sudan attack, and strikes against Islamic militant camps in
Afghanistan, were in retaliation for the Aug. 7 bombings of the
U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   A U.S. intelligence official said Monday that a key factor in
ordering the strike was a soil sample from the plant site that
showed traces of a manmade chemical that is a key ingredient in the
deadly nerve agent VX.
	   ``We have to be satisfied that the United States is not making
this up,'' Salah el-Din said. ``It's not enough to produce soil
which could have been made up in the United States itself, and to
claim that the soil contains toxic agents.''
	   ``For a factory to produce toxic agents, you need special
facilities, special preparations, special storage areas and
preparations facilities,'' he added.
	   Sudan has urged the United Nations to send a team of experts to
inspect the factory.
	   ``You can't keep things to yourself and keep claiming you have
the final proof without allowing people to verify your claims,'' he
said.
	   Sudan has also demanded that the United States publicly
apologize for the strike and compensate the country for damages
estimated at dlrs 100 million, President Omar el-Bashir told The
Associated Press on Monday.
	   El-Bashir said that Britain, which strongly supported the strike
against the factory, was asked to scale down its diplomatic
representation in Khartoum from ambassador level to charge
d'affaires.
	   In the news conference, Salah el-Din indicated that there was
room for maneuvering with Britain.
	   ``If we find a settlement to the present conflict, it's likely
that things may stay the way they were and we can think of
discussing the future relations between Sudan and the United
Kingdom in an amicable manner,'' he said.
	   But, he added, ``if things deteriorate, God forbid, I don't see
any way out of this dilemma.''

Israeli air force looking to space for help in combat
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Israeli air force hopes to benefit from an
expanded program in space, its commander said in an interview
published Tuesday.
	   Maj. Gen. Eitan Ben Eliahu did not say whether Israel intended
to develop weapons in space. However, advances in Israeli space
technology will ``contribute to all aspects of combat,'' he told
the Israeli military's Air Force Journal.
	   Improvements in Israeli satellites and other space technology
will help the military deal more effectively with enemies close to
its borders and those further away such as Iran an Iraq, Ben Eliahu
said.
	   A 1972 U.S.-Soviet Antiballistic treaty bans the deployment of
interceptors in space or other means of destruction of ballistic
missiles, but the treaty does not ban the use of space for early
warning systems.
	   Last month Iran successfully tested a ballistic missile capable
of reaching Israel. Iran is also believed to be developing a
nuclear weapons program. And during the 1991 Gulf War, Israel was
bombarded by 39 Iraqi Scud missiles.
	   Israel has signed and ratified a 1967 international space treaty
which prohibits the stationing of nuclear weapons or other weapons
of mass destruction, in outer space. Israel has never confirmed its
nuclear capabilities but it is believe to have the sixth largest
nuclear arsenal.
	   Israel currently has one spy satellite in orbit, the Ofek. Ben
Eliahu said he'd like to see more. ``In order to achieve effective
coverage, Ofek has to be backed up by a series of satellites of the
same kind.''
	   Another space-related program Ben Eliahu is banking on, is the
America's NASA program, where two Israeli air force officers, one
of whom is slated to participate in a shuttle mission, are
currently training.
	   Ben-Eliahu said the training the Israeli astronauts receive will
enhance Israel's knowledge of the atmosphere, and help the air
force in several areas including photo-reconnaissance missions.

Disney cancels Mickey Mouse visit to Gulf after US attacks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Mickey Mouse and his friends
won't be giggling and laughing with children in Dubai next week.
	   Walt Disney Co. canceled a series of shows scheduled to begin
Saturday at Dubai's Bur Juman mall due to security concerns
following the U.S. missile strikes against Sudan and Afghanistan,
mall manager Eisa Ibrahim said Tuesday. He said the decision was
made by Disney headquarters in Los Angeles.
	   Mickey, Minnie, Goofy and a few friends from the Disney films
Hercules and Aladdin had been scheduled to put on three days of
shows.
	   ``We're disappointed, and we don't think the decision is
justified at all,'' Ibrahim said.
	   The mall management is trying to persuade Disney to reverse its
decision, Ibrahim said.
	   ``It's a shame that political situations like this should affect
business and entertainment opportunities,'' Ibrahim said. Dubai is
``perhaps the safest place to live in the world.''
	   The U.S. Embassy in the United Arab Emirates has advised
Americans to exercise caution in the emirate, but has not said that
there is a specific threat to U.S. citizens in the country.

England selectors keep faith in Stewart
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Fresh from leading England to its first major
test-series win in 12 years, Alec Stewart was Tuesday named to
skipper the England cricket team into next year's World Cup.
	   Stewart, who captained England to a fighting 2-1 test series win
over South Africa this summer, can now focus on the immediate task
at hand _ an arduous Ashes series in Australia.
	   The only real question over Stewart's captaincy arose because of
a clash in schedules between the start of England's Ashes campaign
and a limited-overs tournament in Bangladesh.
	   However, England successfully appealed an International Cricket
Council demand that each test-playing nation send a full-strength
side to the Dhaka tournament.
	   The England hierarchy argued that it's build-up to the first two
tests in Australia would be limited if leading players, including
Stewart, missed much-needed tour matches by playing in Dhaka.
	   Stewart, who had success in his maiden series as captain after
taking over from Mike Atherton, was confirmed as captain for every
series, except Dhaka, until the 1999 World Cup.
	   The only doubt over the team now is which player will lead
England's limited-overs squad in Dhaka.
	   England has been testing the concept of using two captains _ one
for limited overs tournaments and one for test series _ but
Tuesday's announcement puts Stewart at the helm of both teams.

Austria, like Germany, may face compensation claims
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROLAND PRINZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Like Germany, Austria may face
compensation claims from Holocaust survivors who worked as slave
laborers for Austrian companies during Nazi rule.
	   No such claims are known to have been made in the recent past
against Austrian companies. But German firms have been requested to
make such payments, and some of them have refused.
	   Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal recalled Tuesday he had sought
compensation for Holocaust survivors as early as 1946 but was
turned down by those Austrian enterprises who had used wartime
slave labor.
	   About 7 million slave laborers were forced to work in Nazi
Germany. The German government has compensated survivors for
imprisonment and health damage, but has refused to honor wage
claims, saying laborers worked for private companies. In Austria,
up to 700,000 slave laborers were employed during the war.
	   Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany in 1938 and vanished from
the political landscape for seven years.
	   After the end of World War II, Austrian leaders gladly invoked
the so-called Moscow Declaration of 1943, in which the wartime
allies declared Austria the first victim of Nazi dictator Adolf
Hitler's fascist rule.
	   However, Austrians accounted for a disproportionately high
number of people involved in the Nazi death machine, including
members of the dreaded SS, the elite of the German armed forces.
	   Slave labor is only one of several Nazi-era issues which
successive Austrian governments failed to address.
	   U.S. attorney Edward Fagan is planning to meet executives of
Creditanstalt bank to discuss ways of compensating Holocaust
survivors whose gold was stolen by the Nazis and allegedly
transferred by the bank to Turkey during the war.
	   He has waived, for the time being, a class action lawsuit
against the Vienna bank.
	   Chancellor Viktor Klima has suggested that Austrian companies
should react ``with the greatest possible openness'' to claims from
victims of Nazi terror.
	   Other issues still unresolved 53 years after the collapse of
Nazi rule include compensation for those whose companies were
``Aryanized'' by the Nazis and in some cases nationalized by the
Austrian government after the war.
	   In a statement Tuesday, Wiesenthal said he first raised the
compensation issue in 1946 when he served as president of the
Jewish Central Committee for the American occupation zone in
Austria.
	   He said he was authorized to make the claims by then-infirm
workers forced to work in the Hermann Goering Werke, which after
the war became the nationalized VOEST-Alpine iron and steel
concern.
	   A year after the end of the war, Wiesenthal wrote letters to
VOEST Alpine, Steyr-Daimler-Puch, an engineering enterprise that
produced weapons for the Nazi army, as well as a construction
enterprise and a large papermill.
	   ``The answers were all negative, with the most varying arguments
in favor of rejection being advanced,'' he said.
	   VOEST Alpine reportedly told him that for providing
concentration camp inmates, the company paid fixed daily rates on a
monthly basis to the camp management. In addition, the company
said, it also paid for accommodation, the canteen and other things.
	   According to Wiesenthal, company managers even claimed that, all
things considered, ``the use of concentration camp inmates was
financially more expensive for the company and building enterprises
than `civilian' workers ...''

Serbs accused of killing three charity workers in Kosovo

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police let an ethnic Albanian
food convoy to refugees of the Kosovo conflict pass their
checkpoint then shelled it, killing three aid workers, a survivor
of the alleged attack said Tuesday.
	   The Mother Teresa humanitarian organization said the three were
killed Monday after police allowed them to pass through a
checkpoint near Malisevo, a former rebel stronghold in central
Kosovo that Serb forces overran last month.
	   The survivor was identified as Mustafe Krasniqi by a spokesman
for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, the main international
aid organization in Kosovo.
	   The spokesman, Fernando del Mundo, told The Associated Press
that Krasniqi was unhurt except for minor burns suffered while
trying to snatch aid packages from the trailer he was pulling with
a tractor, after police set it afire.
	   The Serbs raked Krasniqi's tractor with sub-machine gun fire
after the shell landed on another tractor about 500 meters (yards)
away from him, killing two aid workers instantly and mortally
wounding the third, said del Mundo.
	   There was no immediate comment from Serbian authorities on the
alleged attack.
	   Del Mundo said both Krasniqi and local villagers said the
seven-tractor convoy was deliberately targeted. Shells continued
landing in the area for about 15 minutes after the one that killed
the three aid workers, they reportedly said.
	   The charity, based in Kosovo, is responsible for the bulk of
humanitarian assistance to the province, distributing such items as
wheat flour and soap. It is not affiliated with the Sisters of
Charity, Mother Teresa's India-based missionary order.
	   The Pristina daily Koha Ditore and the Albanians' Kosovo
Information Center gave similar accounts.
	   As U.S. envoy Christopher Hill prepared to meet in Belgrade with
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, there were new reports of
fighting and more condemnation of the Serbs.
	   Serbian police and the Yugoslav army continued shelling several
villages southwest of Pristina in their drive to crush separatist
resistance among Kosovo's majority ethnic Albanians.
	   According to the Kosovo Information Center, three ethnic
Albanians, including one woman, were killed Tuesday in the town of
Suva Reka. The center said Serb forces were burning houses in the
town, following clashes Monday.
	   ``We denounce the continuing violence in Kosovo which is forcing
more people to flee,'' spokesman Kris Janowski of the UNHCR said
Tuesday in Geneva. ``The situation is getting worse and worse.''
	   He said the U.N. agency is planning to double its staff in
Pristina to around 14 but has been hindered by delays in obtaining
visas from Belgrade authorities.
	   Returning from the Pagarusa area southwest of Pristina and near
Malisevo, del Mundo said villagers told him that the region
contained about 20,000 recently arrived refugees fleeing the newest
Serb and Yugoslav offensive that began Sunday.
	   He could not confirm the numbers but said: ``I definitely saw a
lot of people and the refugees I talked to said their villages were
empty.''
	   UNHCR sent a 10-truck convoy Tuesday to refugees in the Baranski
Do region 60 kilometers (35 miles) west of Pristina. Humanitarian
agencies estimate that as many as 50,000 refugees in Kosovo are
living in the open.
	   The convoy, carrying relief for some of the estimated 30,000
refugees in the region, arrived safely and was on its way back to
Pristina late Tuesday, said del Mundo. It was carrying 110 tons of
wheat flour and 2,000 family parcels that included food for a
month, blankets and other emergency material.
	   The Serbs, meanwhile, accused the ethnic Albanians' Kosovo
Liberation Army of making more guerrilla attacks against them. The
pro-Serb Media Center said a group of rebels ambushed an ambulance
on Monday, wounding the driver, a doctor and another passenger.

TV Azteca bids 43 million dollars for Mexican federation rights
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ TV Azteca SA has submitted a dlrs 43 million
bid to share marketing and broadcast rights to the Mexican soccer
federation with archrival Grupo Televisa SA.
	   Azteca, Mexico's No. 2 television broadcaster after Televisa,
said the bid Monday combined with Televisa's dlrs 43 million offer
would give the federation dlrs 86 million.
	   Acting on an Azteca complaint, Mexico's antitrust commission
last month launched an investigation of a four-year contract
extension that the federation had granted to Televisa without
asking bids.
	   ``TV Azteca doesn't want to exclude Televisa or have exclusive
broadcasting rights,'' TV Azteca said in a press release. ``On the
contrary, it wants to join forces with those who have genuine
interest in improving the most popular sport in our country.''
	   Despite having a much smaller potential audience, Azteca
achieved ratings close to those of Televisa during recent World Cup
broadcasts.
	   The federation won't comment on the contract until club owners
meet next Monday to review it, said spokesman Carlos Martinez.
	   Televisa officials did not immediately respond to requests for
official comment. But the daily Reforma quoted an anonymous
Televisa official as rejecting the Azteca proposal.

Tanzanian president wants to focus on terrorists' action
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa
said Tuesday that finding the perpetrators of the Aug. 7 bombings
of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 257 people, was
more important than commenting on U.S. attacks on suspected
terrorist sites.
	   ``I regret that we are directing our attention much more to the
reaction than to the action of the bombers and terrorists,'' Mkapa
told a news conference. ``It is violence against me. The more
important thing is what do we do to end terrorism.''
	   Last week, President Clinton ordered attacks on facilities in
Afghanistan and Sudan which are suspected to be linked with Osama
bin Laden, the Saudi millionaire allegedly behind the bombings.
	   The FBI has 215 agents, lab examiners, evidence technicians,
computer specialists, photographers and translators in Kenya and
Tanzania, working alongside with a forensic team from Britain.
	   ``We have very important leads to find the perpetrators,'' Mkapa
said, adding Tanzanian authorities are holding four suspects. He
refused to comment further.
	   The Tanzanian president said his country would ``obviously try
to strengthen our protection'' of foreign diplomats and be ``more
vigilant about who we admit into our country although we're a very
open society.''

League chiefs reject Super League moves
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Leaders of Europe's major domestic soccer leagues
on Tuesday rejected rival plans for a breakaway super league.
	   UEFA's Committee for Professional Football said it opposed the
project by Media Partners, a Milan-based company, for the formation
of a new league composed of Europe's most elite clubs.
	   ``This committee rejects this private project,'' said Italy's
Antonio Matarrese, the committee chairman and also a UEFA vice
president. ``The committee does not feel it deserves our
attention.''
	   The meeting was attended by UEFA general secretary Gerhard
Aigner and the heads of European leagues, including Peter Leaver of
England's Premier League and Franco Carraro of Italy's Serie A.
Also attending were leaders of the leagues in Portugal,
Netherlands, France, Germany, Belgiam, Austria and Spain.
	   Matarrese said there were ``moments of antagonism'' among
members but by the end of the meeting all were in agreement in
opposing the super league plan.
	   The meeting came one day after Media Partners discussed the
proposals with leading European clubs in London.
	   Media Partners hopes to form a Super League by 2001 involving
the biggest names in European soccer, including Bayern Munich,
Ajax, Inter and AC Milan, Manchester United and Arsenal.
	   However, UEFA could seek to head off the threat of a breakaway
leauge at a meeting in Monaco on Saturday, where changes to the
format of the three major European club championships will be
discussed.
	   Aigner confirmed Tuesday that UEFA plans to merge the UEFA Cup
and Cup Winners Cup.

Cuba raises local phone rates
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Talkative Cubans will have to pay more for
telephone service starting next month, according to reports on
Tuesday.
	   The Communist Party daily Granma said that for the first time, a
per-minute charge will be placed on local calls.
	   The newspaper said the new charges affect only calls made
through new digital phone systems, which serve 19 percent of Cubans
and 29 percent of those in Havana.
	   Residential users will be allowed 300 minutes for their minimum
monthly fee of 6.25 pesos. That is only about 33 cents at
free-market exchange rates, but is also close to a day's wage for
many Cubans.
	   Additional minutes cost 3 centavos at peak hours and 2 centavos
other times.
	   Officials said the idea is to discourage overuse of telephones.

Russia plans debt structuring, considers coalition with Communists

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government battled Tuesday to pull the
country out of economic and political crisis, preparing a massive
debt restructuring and signaling that some hard-line opponents may
be given top posts.
	   However, in a sign that hopes of a recovery continue to crumble,
the ruble plummeted 10 percent in trading Tuesday _ its biggest
one-day plunge in nearly four years.
	   The currency closed at 7.86 to the dollar, down from 7.14 on
Monday. Trading was suspended twice when the Central Bank was
overwhelmed by demand for dollars.
	   Russia's crisis has raised alarms around the world. U.S.
President Bill Clinton phoned Boris Yeltsin and expressed support
for his efforts to fix the economy, White House officials said. But
they indicated that the United States' interest is in promoting
reform, not individual leaders.
	   Clinton is scheduled to arrive in Moscow in less than a week for
a summit with Yeltsin.
	   The Russian government has been struggling to contain the
crisis, which began in early summer when the stock market went into
a deep skid and hit a low point when the Central Bank effectively
devalued the ruble last week. The Russian economy has been wracked
by the global emerging markets crisis and the drop in oil prices,
its main export.
	   The government also effectively defaulted on its short-term
debt, announcing that holders of dlrs 40 billion in treasury bills
_ dlrs 11 billion of it held by foreigners _ would have to accept a
new repayment plan.
	   Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin approved that plan
Tuesday, but its terms were not immediately announced. Investors
have said they expect the government to offer them the option of
swapping into long-term dollar denominated paper with a very modest
return, or much higher-yielding paper denominated in rubles.
	   Last weekend Yeltsin reinstated Chernomyrdin, the long-time
former prime minister he fired five months ago, in the hope that a
well-known face and political ``heavyweight'' will restore
confidence at home and abroad. His nomination must still be
approved by parliament.
	   ``There has never been such a low percentage of people who
believe in the government in all of Russia's years of reform,''
said Mikhail Gorshkov, an analyst at the Independent Institute of
Social and National Problems, a leading polling agency.
	   Chernomyrdin suggested Tuesday that one way to mend relations
with the hard-line lower house of parliament, the State Duma, would
be to give in to their calls for a ``government of accord'' with
prominent jobs given to Communists and other Yeltsin foes.
	   The Communists, parliament's largest faction, have long called
for such a coalition government. In previous political crises
Yeltsin has appointed a few Communists to the Cabinet, but
Chernomyrdin appeared to indicate the intention this time would be
more sweeping.
	   Altogether, only three members of the Communist Party have
served in the Cabinet since the Soviet collapse. The latest
appointment came last month, when Yeltsin appointed Yuri Maslyukov,
the former chairman of Soviet Gosplan state planning agency, as
minister of trade and industry.
	   Both previous Communist appointments were short-lived. Justice
Minister Valentin Kovalyov lasted just two years, fired in 1997
after he was filmed with nude models in a sauna. Siberian governor
Aman Tuleyev was named minister in charge of relations with the
former Soviet republics in 1996, but was fired a year later.
	   These appointments were largely seen as an attempt by Yeltsin to
placate the Communist-dominated Duma, but he continually rejected
their calls for a coalition government.
	   Other developments Tuesday:
	   _ Stocks rose in thin trading. The Russian Trading System (RTS)
index closed at 88.38 points, up 2.3 percent from Monday's close at
86.40. Trading volume was tiny at dlrs 8.5 million.
	   _ Three of the nation's leading banks _ Oneximbank, Bank Menatep
and Most Bank _ announced a merger in an apparent attempt to
prevent an acute liquidity crisis by combining their assets. Most
Russian banks have found themselves in a difficult position after
last week's devaluation because of overdependence on ruble assets.
	   _ The French petroleum company Elf Aquitaine decided to abandon
a proposed alliance with Russia's Sibneft worth dlrs 500 million
because of economic instability in Russia and low world oil prices.

Czech Ultranationalist faces new trial on racial hatred charge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Miroslav Sladek, the head of the
Czech ultranationalist Republican Party who was acquitted of
charges of instigating racial and national hatred, faces a retrial
on the same charges, the Czech news agency CTK reported Tuesday.
	   Stanislava Pichova, the chairwoman of Prague City Court's
appeals senate, said the court was dissatisfied with the lower
Prague District Court's asessment of evidence submitted by the
state prosecutor.
	   She said the District Court would have to deal with the case
again, and the higher court would advise it how to proceed.
	   During a visit by German Chancellor Helmut Kohl last year,
Sladek told a rally: ``We can only be sorry that we killed too few
Germans during the war.''
	   Kohl had come to Prague to sign a Czech-German declaration aimed
at ending years of hostility between the two nations.
	   Sladek was charged with ``inciting racial and national hatred,''
a crime punishable by up to two years in jail.
	   According to CTK, the District Court acquitted Sladek on Jan.
23, and the judge then justified the ruling saying Sladek's
statements should be seen in the context of his entire speech.
	   The state attorney appealed the acquittal on Feb. 20.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A Hong Kong man plunged to his death Tuesday
from a ninth-floor apartment after attacking fellow tenants and
threatening to blow up the building with a liquefied gas cylinder,
police reported.
	   The man injured three tenants in the apartment with a knife and
threatened to set alight the gas cylinder by the time officers
arrived at the scene, police said.
	   The assailant then climbed out the window with the gas cylinder
and sat on an air-conditioner on the ledge of the building.
	   He jumped as police tried to persuade him to surrender.
	   Radio Hong Kong said the man was believed to be a drug addict.

Iraq strongly denies weapons connection to Sudanese factory
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraq strongly denies U.S. intelligence
charges that it worked with Sudanese scientists at a Khartoum plant
to build chemical weapons projects, the Iraqi ambassador said
Tuesday.
	   Iraq's only contact with the pharmacy was to fill pharmaceutical
contracts, Nizar Hamdoon told reporters. The U.S. charges are
``part of the effort to try to muddle the whole situation in order
to cover up the problem that they've had with the bombing of the
Sudan,'' Hamdoon said.
	   U.S. intelligence officials linked the plant to Iraqi scientists
on Monday as part of an effort to back its justification for
bombing the factory last Thursday. The officials said they had
intercepted phone conversations between scientists at the plant and
some of the top officials in Iraq's chemical weapons program.
	   Soil sample from the plant site showed traces of EMPTA, a
manmade chemical that has no commercial uses and is a key
ingredient in the deadly nerve agent VX, U.S. intelligence
officials said.
	   Iraq, which has been subject to U.N. inspections of its
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons programs since the end of
the Gulf war, has acknowledged that it produced VX but couldn't use
it as a weapon.
	   The United States has come under pressure to justify its strike
following Sudan's claims that the El Shifa Pharmaceutical
Industries Co., plant produced only medicinal drugs and vaccines.
	   In a letter Tuesday to the Security Council, Sudan's U.N.
ambassador, Elfatih Erwa said the plant supplied Sudan with 90
percent of its medicine for treating animals.
	   The factory also produced anti-malarials, and drugs to treat
ulcers, diabetes, rheumatism and hypertension. It is the only
factory in Sudan which produces the drug to treat pulmonary
tuberculosisis, Erwa said.
	   He gave a list of recent visits to the plant by dignitaries,
including the current German and former British ambassadors to
Sudan, and Hussein El-Bazazi, the eastern Mediterranean regional
director for the U.N. World Health Organization.
	   The United Nations approved a dlrs 199,000 contract last January
for the plant to ship Iraq 100,000 litres of Shifazole, which
controls parasitic diseases in horses and cows, as part of the U.N.
program that lets Iraq sell its oil to buy food and medicine.
	   The contract was renewed July 7 because the plant hadn't
delivered the goods within the six-month timeframe stipulated in
the original contract. U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said such an
extension is not unusual in contracts for the oil-for-food program.
	   ``In that context we have had commercial ties but nothing beyond
that and we strongly deny there has been any chemical connections
regarding that,'' Hamdoon said.
	   He said Iraq hoped the Security Council would agree to Sudan's
request that an independent technical team visit the site to
determine whether the U.S. claims were true.
	   On Monday, the deputy U.S. ambassador, Peter Burleigh, said no
such investigation was needed because the United States already had
compelling evidence.

Investigators still looking at Henri Paul's blood
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with investigation into level of carbon monoxide in
Henri Paul's blood, other details. No pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By JOCELYN NOVECK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Nearly a year after Princess Diana's death,
investigators are still examining the blood of driver Henri Paul _
this time not for alcohol, but to explain an abnormally high level
of carbon monoxide.
	   The revelation came in a rare statement issued Tuesday by
prosecutors in the case, in which they also said the investigation
would end in October.
	   It was the first comprehensive statement prosecutors had issued
since the early days of the case, when they described the elevated
alcohol level in driver Paul's blood.
	   Paul was killed in the crash last Aug. 31 in the Pont de l'Alma
traffic tunnel, along with Diana and her boyfriend, Dodi Fayed.
	   Repeated blood tests found that he was heavily drunk at the
time. That, and the high speed he was believed traveling at, always
have been assumed to be the major reasons for the crash.
	   Three tests are still under way in the investigation, the
statement said, including one on ``the origin of the level of
carbon monoxide, slightly higher than average, found in the blood
of driver Henri Paul.''
	   It isn't clear what could cause the high level. But it could
cause dizziness, headaches, nausea and disorientation. If very
serious, it can lead to a coma.
	   Another ongoing investigation, the statement said, is being
carried out regarding the care that Diana received on the scene.
There have been claims by some doctors, especially in the United
States, that Diana would have had a better chance if rushed right
away to the hospital rather than treated on the scene.
	   The third investigation is being carried out on the body of the
wrecked Mercedes, at a lab outside Paris.
	   The statement said all these tests should be completed by the
end of October.
	   The statement Tuesday evening came after a day in which two key
witnesses were questioned by Judge Herve Stephan: the president of
the Ritz Hotel, Frank Klein, and his assistant.
	   It was the first time Stephan had questioned Ritz management
about the accident. No details of the questioning were immediately
available.
	   The prosecutors' office said it had released the statement due
to a crush of media queries surrounding the anniversary of Diana's
death.
	   Among the details it provided:
	   _ More than 60 police officers were mobilized during the first
72 hours after the crash.
	   _ Police interviewed 153 people as potential witnesses to the
crash.
	   _ They also interviewed almost 3,000 owners of Fiat Unos, in an
effort to find the car that is believed to have brushed against the
Mercedes before it crashed. Although the statement didn't say so,
that effort is believed to have been unsuccessful, and police are
believed to have basically given up the search.

Cyprus protests to UN about Turkish shots at fishing boats
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Cyprus protested to the U.N. peacekeeping
force Tuesday that Turkish forces had fired at two Greek Cypriot
fishing boats.
	   Government spokesman Christos Stylianides said one of the boats
was hit by eight bullets early Tuesday as it was trying to haul in
nets cast off the Turkish-occupied port of Famagusta, east Cyprus.
	   None of the four fishermen in the boats was hurt.
	   The fishermen had cast the nets Monday night well beyond marker
buoys that indicate the sea limits of the Turkish occupation,
Stylianides said.
	   Cyprus has been divided into a Turkish-occupied north and a
Greek Cypriot south since Turkey invaded the island in 1974 after a
coup by supporters of union with Greece.
	   After a Turkish patrol boat opened fire, the fishermen withdrew,
he said. Their nets, worth more than dlrs 8,000, were picked up by
the Turkish patrol boat.
	   A statement by the Turkish Cypriot breakaway state said the
patrol boat had fired only warnings shots in the air after the
fishing boats had violated its sea space.
	   But Cypriot television showed police and U.N. peacekeepers
examining what looked like bullet holes on one of the boats.
	   Firing at fishing boats is rare in the Cypriot conflict. The
last instance took place more than a year ago.

Tanzanian president wants to focus on terrorists' action
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Finding the perpetrators of the Aug.
7 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania was more
important than commenting on U.S. attacks on suspected terrorist
sites, Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa said Tuesday that
	   ``I regret that we are directing our attention much more to the
reaction than to the action of the bombers and terrorists,'' Mkapa
told a news conference. ``It is violence against me. The more
important thing is what do we do to end terrorism.''
	   Last week, U.S. President Bill Clinton ordered attacks on
facilities in Afghanistan and Sudan suspected to be linked with
Osama bin Laden, the Saudi millionaire allegedly behind the
bombings which killed 257 people.
	   The FBI has 215 agents, lab examiners, evidence technicians,
computer specialists, photographers and translators in Kenya and
Tanzania, working alongside with a forensic team from Britain.
	   ``We have very important leads to find the perpetrators,'' Mkapa
said, adding Tanzanian authorities are holding four suspects. He
refused to comment further.
	   The Tanzanian president said his country would ``obviously try
to strengthen our protection'' of foreign diplomats and be ``more
vigilant about who we admit into our country although we're a very
open society.''

Former chairman of Hong Kong company arrested on fraud charges
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) - A former chairman of Hong Kong's Allied Group
was arrested Tuesday on fraud charges as he was about to leave for
mainland China, local press reports said.
	   The reports said Lee Ming-tee, a Malaysian-Chinese, was arrested
at a border checkpoint, but it was not known which city he was
planning to visit on the Chinese mainland.
	   Police confirmed that a former chairman of the company was
detained on charges of conspiracy to defraud, but declined to
further identify the suspect.
	   Allied came under investigation in 1992 for shares deals between
January 1990 and May 1992 that regulators said may have breached
the territory's takeover and disclosure rules.
	   The Hong Kong government said in 1993 that the probe into the
property and manufacturing group uncovered evidence that company
executives sidestepped shareholder-protection rules and disguised
share transactions.
	   It said the investigation showed standards of commercial
corporate conduct that gave serious cause for concern, but did not
say at the time what legal action it planned to take.
	   Officials of the company were not available for comment Tuesday
night.

Pakistani official calls for talks, denies help to Taliban
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Pakistan's foreign minister expressed concern over
fighting in Afghanistan on Tuesday and repeated denials that his
country is helping the fundamentalist Taliban movement.
	   Pakistan has been accused to assisting the Taliban movement, but
both Pakistan and the Taliban have denied such accusations.
	   Pakistani Foreign Minister Mohammed Siddique Kanju, who visited
Tajikistan on Tuesday as part of a tour of Central Asia, also
called for foreign nations to negotiate with the Taliban in order
to help establish peace, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Meanwhile, Tajik President Emomali Rakhmonov, worried about a
possible spillover of violence from Afghanistan, urged the
fundamentalists and anti-Taliban opposition to stop fighting and
begin negotiations, the Interfax news agency said.
	   Russia and the former Soviet republics in Central Asia fear an
influx of refugees and weapons across their borders from
Afghanistan, and possibly a spillover of fighting.

	   LONDON (AP) _ U.S. and Pakistani officials called Tuesday for an
early resumption of the Pakistan-India dialogue, and the United
States expressed support for a swift agreement on multilateral
loans to ease Pakistan's economic difficulties.
	   A joint statement following a fourth round of talks between the
two countries on peace, economic security and nuclear
nonproliferation described the meeting as ``serious, substantive
and constructive.''
	   Before the talks got under way at a secret location in London,
Pakistan indicated its support for a ban on nuclear testing and the
transfer of nuclear technology.
	   But no agreement on nonproliferation issues was announced and
the statement said discussions would continue at the expert level
in September in Islamabad, the Pakistani capital.
	   Since India and Pakistan conducted underground nuclear tests in
May, the United States has been trying to prevent a nuclear arms
race in South Asia.
	   Pakistan's foreign secretary, Shamshad Ahmed, said in a
statement before the start of talks with U.S. Deputy Secretary of
State Strobe Talbott that peace and economic security were at the
top of Pakistan's concerns.
	   Pakistan's fragile economy, which depends more heavily than
India's on international loans, has suffered from economic
sanctions the United States and other world powers imposed on both
countries after their nuclear tests.
	   But the Clinton administration decided in July that it would not
stand in the way of new International Monetary Fund lending to
Pakistan or to the rescheduling of Islamabad's loans from other
nations, its so-called Paris Club debt.
	   In the final statement Tuesday, the United States expressed
support for ``an early agreement'' between Pakistan and the IMF
``to alleviate Pakistan's economic difficulties.'' It also
expressed support for a similar early agreement between Pakistan
and Paris Club lenders.
	   ``Continuation of coercive sanctions will not help; these have
always proved to be counterproductive,'' Ahmed noted.
	   At Tuesday's meeting, issues of regional security, arms control
and nonproliferation measures were discussed, as well as recent
developments in the region.
	   ``Both sides attached importance to continued strong bilateral
ties in the interest of peace and security in the region and their
desire for a broad and constructive relationship with each other,''
the joint statement said.
	   During previous talks, Pakistan pressed for world involvement in
settling the volatile Kashmir dispute, which has been the cause of
two wars between Pakistan and India. The two neighbors fought a
third war over Bangladesh or what was then East Pakistan.
	   India has rejected international mediation in the Kashmir
dispute. Both countries lay claim to a united Kashmir, divided
between Pakistan and India by the departing British in 1947.
	   Kashmir was discussed at Tuesday's meeting and both sides agreed
``on the need for early resumption of the Pakistan-India
dialogue,'' the U.S. statement said.
	   Peace talks between prime ministers of the two countries in Sri
Lanka broke down in July, purportedly over procedural wrangles.
Pakistan _ which calls Kashmir the ``core issue'' _ has insisted on
resolving the dispute before discussing other issues like two-way
trade and easing of visa regulations. India wants simultaneous
discussion on all issues.
	   Ahmed said before the meeting that Pakistan supports
nonproliferation but will not give up its newly acquired nuclear
capabality _ ``its credible deterrence capability.''
	   The Americans have been pushing for Pakistan and India to sign
the nuclear test ban treaty as a first step toward reducing
tensions.

Kuwait and Washington cooperating to fight terrorism
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Kuwait and the United States are cooperating to
fight terrorism, Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah, the crown prince,
said in remarks published Tuesday.
	   Sheik Saad, who serves as prime minister, spoke in response to
U.S. press reports alleging that Kuwaiti Islamic charity
organizations had links with terrorists responsible for the Aug. 7
bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   Kuwait and Washington are cooperating in the fight against
terrorism and the two governments are ``exchanging information,''
he told the Al-Rai Al-Amm daily.
	   ``We are now communicating through diplomatic channels with
American officials about this matter,'' Sheik Saad said.
	   The bombings led to U.S. missile strikes last week at suspected
training camps in Afghanistan and a pharmaceutical plant in the
Sudanese capital suspected of making precursors for chemical
weapons.
	   Several Kuwaiti Muslim fundamentalist charities are active in
Africa, Asia, and eastern Europe.

	   ------
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Representatives of Guinea-Bissau's
government and rebel forces planned to meet in another attempt at
ending a three-month dispute in the West African country, news
reports said Tuesday.
	   The government's chief negotiatior Joao Cardoso and his rebel
counterpart Emilio Costa flew 700 kilometers (430 miles) to the
Cape Verde archipelago for a third round of peace talks, the
Portuguese news agency Lusa reported.
	   The fighting stopped last month when both sides agreed to a
cease-fire sponsored by the Community of Portuguese-Speaking
Countries, CPLP, after seven weeks of fighting in the capital
Bissau.
	   A military faction mutinied June 7 following Brig. Ansumane
Mane's dismissal as army chief. The rebels accused President Joao
Bernardo Vieira of corruption and demanded he resign.
	   Upon their arrival in the Atlantic islands, Cardoso and Costa
expressed confidence that the talks would take their July 26 truce
one step further, the Portuguese news agency Lusa said.
	   ``The fact that we disagree does not mean we're not brothers. We
can travel together, talk and come to an understanding,'' Lusa
quoted Cardoso as saying.
	   The talks were to be brokered jointly by the Economic Community
of West African States and the CPLP, Lusa reported.
	   Meanwhile 150 tons of food supplies were shipped Thursday from
the capital to the southern town of Tombali, Lusa reported. Aid
groups had warned of a possible humanitarian crisis if some 300,000
displaced did not receive food and medicine.
	   ------ &QC; 
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Sudan's eastern Kassala district, already
hit hard by shelling, is now suffering from heavy flooding, and the
Red Cross said Tuesday it was sending in sandbags and blankets for
victims.
	   About 1,200 families have been affected by flooding from the
Gash River, which has damaged schools, health centers, mosques and
homes, the International Committee of the Red Cross said.
	   In the same region, about 60,000 Sudanese have been displaced by
shelling, and the Red Cross said it has also been working to bring
them assistance. Sudanese rebels frequently cross the Eritrean
border to attack government garrisons in Kassala.
	   The aid was being distributed through the Sudanese Red Crescent,
according to the ICRC.
	   ------ &QC; 
	   BLANTYRE, Malawi (AP) _ The Malawian currency plunged to a
record low Tuesday against the U.S. dollar, largely because of a
drop in hard currency earnings from tobacco and declines in the
related South African and Zimbabwean currencies, the central bank
said.
	   The kwacha weakened to 42 to the U.S. dollar, from 35 on Friday
and 26 at the beginning of last week.
	   The Reserve Bank of Malawi said it adjusted the kwacha's value
downwards because of a dlrs 80 million drop in tobacco export
earnings and the weakening currencies of its principal trading
partners.
	   In a statement, the central bank said ``information on the
ground'' indicated further dramatic drops in the kwacha value were
not anticipated in the near term.
	   Local news reports said increases in interest rates and
inflation were expected.
	   ------ &QC; 
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ The government is building two new
prisons to ease overcrowding, prison service officials said.
	   Spokesman Frankie Meki said the prisons are being constructed in
central and western Zimbabwe and were the first new ``corrective
institutions'' in more than a decade.
	   The nation's 37 antiquated prisons and holding centers were
mostly built in the colonial era before independence in 1980 and
were designed to hold fewer than 16,000 prisoners.
	   Despite a successful program of community service sentences for
minor offenders that has reduced custodial sentences by about
one-fifth, Meki said Monday that existing facilities hold more than
18,000 convicts.
	   Overcrowding has been blamed for a rise in hygiene-related
diseases, tuberculosis and a lack of supervision that has led to an
increase in homosexual activity and homosexual assault, causing
more cases of the deadly AIDS disease.
	   ------ &QC; 
	   ACCRA, Ghana (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan was
awarded an honorary doctorate degree by his Ghanaian alma mater for
``distinguished service to the international community.''
	   Annan, accompanied by his wife and daughter, received the award
Monday during a ceremony at the University of Science and
Technology, in the western city Kumasi.
	   The colorful ceremony, animated with traditional horn-blowing
and drumming, was attended by government officials, high-ranking
diplomats and the university community. Kumasi was the capital of
the Ashanti kingdom, once one of the most powerful kingdoms in West
Africa.
	   Acting Vice-Chancellor Professor Abrose Tuah handed Annan the
university's traditional red and green doctoral gown, awarded for
his ``outstanding pioneering role ... as the first international
civil servant to have risen through the ranks of the U.N.
bureaucracy to head the world organization.''
	   Annan, the international body's first Secretary-General from
sub-Saharan Africa, studied at the Ghanaian university from
1958-1959 before leaving to complete his undergraduate studies in
economics at Macalester College in the United States.

Air Force pilots moving to the private sector cause worry
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ The loss of military pilots to civil
aviation is putting national security at risk, says the Air Force
and officers' unions.
	   ``We are coming close to not being able to maintain the required
level of security,'' Air Force Maj. Kalevi Reiman said Tuesday.
	   This year, some 30 pilots have transferred to the private
sector. Fifteen of them found a new job at the national carrier,
Finnair.
	   ``We see this type of situation every 10 years or so,'' said
Reiman, ``But this time it's quite acute.''
	   Last week, the officers' unions demanded a substantial increase
in the wages of military pilots to prevent further losses.
	   ``If the loss of pilots is not stopped, the control of our
airspace is endangered,'' the unions said in a statement.
	   Earlier this month, the CEO of Finnair, Antti Potila, suggested
cooperation between air force training and Finnair's own pilot
training.
	   The Air Force sees the offer as a positive development, but does
not expect it to solve the current lack of pilots as it may take
over a year until agreements are made.
	   Despite the fee of up to 300,000 markkaa (dlrs 55,000) imposed
on pilots who break their agreement, the Air Force fears further
losses.
	   ``What we need is a moderate increase in the pilot's income, as
well as an increase in their flight hours,'' Reiman said.
	   Recently, The Ministry of Communications, in response to
Finnair's suggestion, set up plan to assess and balance the pilot
needs of both the Air Force and private companies by the end of the
year.

Airbus scores coup with first sale to British Airways
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs version &QL; 
 &UR; By DIRK BEVERIDGE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ In the bitter rivalry between Airbus
Industrie and the Boeing Co., the Europeans scored a sweet victory
over the Americans on Tuesday as British Airways announced its
first-ever order of Airbus jets.
	   The Airbus chief executive, Noel Forgeard, called it the
``crowning achievement of a successful commercial year,'' but
British Airways was more blunt.
	   ``They were significantly cheaper,'' chief executive Bob Ayling
said after flying _ in an Airbus A320 _ to the European
planemaker's hometown and announcing 59 firm orders of short-haul
Airbus jets and options on another 129.
	   Ayling insisted British Airways will stay a good customer to
Boeing, after also announcing Tuesday it will order 16 Boeing 777s,
with options for 16 more.
	   Some of the 777 orders replace Boeing 747 orders, however, as
British Airways moves to maximize profits on some busy
transatlantic routes by flying slightly smaller airplanes that are
easier to fill with passengers.
	   All told, British Airways said it was buying airplanes with a
list price of 3 billion pounds (dlrs 5 billion) _ and Airbus got
about two-thirds of that business, an industry executive said
privately.
	   Although Boeing proclaimed victory in its 777 sales, it was a
day when Airbus stole the show, hosting British Prime Minister Tony
Blair and French transport minister Jean-Claude Gayssot in a hangar
at Blagnac Airport.
	   Airbus used Ayling's jet as the backdrop, and the champagne
flowed freely.
	   Airbus has fought for years to sell its jets to British Airways,
but failed as the big British carrier stuck with Seattle-based
Boeing. The only Airbus jets now flown by British Airways are 10
models acquired years ago in its takeover of a small rival carrier.
	   Airbus executives could barely contain their glee at winning the
order _ for a mix of A319, A320 and A321 models _ after a half-year
of bidding in which Forgeard said he demanded a higher purchase
price than Boeing wanted for 737 models.
	   Airbus promised better reliability that will make the airplanes
cheaper to fly over time, Forgeard said.
	   ``We're glad to have snatched this one away,'' Airbus spokesman
Andrew Huige said. ``It's a real feather in our cap.''
	   The European aviation executives and politicians conceded they
need to bring their many national aerospace companies closer
together to get onto a more level playing field with giant American
rivals, but they insist they are getting closer.
	   ``We look forward to the day when Airbus is the No. 1 producer
of civil airlines in the world,'' Blair enthused. ``This is
achievable.''
	   Not so fast, industry experts say.
	   Airbus has made impressive strides, and is enjoying a
particularly good summer after a recent deal to sell wide-body jets
to US Airways.
	   But analysts say the gains at Airbus have come only in certain
segments of the market where it can compete. Boeing still has a
monopoly on the lucrative jumbo jet business, where its big 747
models reign supreme.
	   Still, the British Airways deal may put Airbus _ a consortium of
companies from France, Germany, Spain and Britain _ ``pretty close
to parity'' in markets where it competes with Boeing, according to
Paul Beaver at Jane's Information Group in London.
	   ``It's a big win for them and a big loss for Boeing,'' agreed
Paul H. Nisbet, an analyst at JSA Research Inc., a firm in Newport,
Rhode Island, that follows aviation stocks.
	   Airbus claims it now gets about half of the world's airplane
orders.
	   But Nisbet noted that Boeing has maintained a two-thirds market
share for some time, when the business is measured by revenues
instead of the numbers of airplanes sold.
	   ``The number of aircraft? This can be misleading, because some
of the big ones are worth five times the smallest ones,'' Nisbet
said.

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Finding the perpetrators of the Aug.
7 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania was more
important than commenting on U.S. attacks on suspected terrorist
sites, Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa said Tuesday.
	   ``I regret that we are directing our attention much more to the
reaction than to the action of the bombers and terrorists,'' Mkapa
said at a news conference. ``It is violence against me. The more
important thing is what do we do to end terrorism.''
	   Last week, U.S. President Bill Clinton ordered attacks on
facilities in Afghanistan and Sudan suspected to be linked with
Osama bin Laden, the Saudi millionaire allegedly behind the
bombings that killed 257 people.
	   The FBI has 215 agents, lab examiners, evidence technicians,
computer specialists, photographers and translators in Kenya and
Tanzania, working alongside a forensic team from Britain.
	   ``We have very important leads to find the perpetrators,'' Mkapa
said, adding Tanzanian authorities are holding four suspects. He
refused to comment further.
	   The Tanzanian president said his country would ``obviously try
to strengthen our protection'' of foreign diplomats and be ``more
vigilant about who we admit into our country although we're a very
open society.''

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council would agree to
suspend U.N. sanctions against Libya once two Libyan suspects in
the 1988 Pan Am bombing arrive in the Netherlands for trial,
according to a draft resolution Tuesday.
	   The U.S.-British-sponsored draft also says Libya must satisfy
the French judicial inquiry into another bombing, of UTA flight
772, before the sanctions are suspended.
	   The draft circulated as the council began preliminary
consultations Tuesday on a deal to try the two suspects in the Pan
Am flight at The Hague using Scottish judges.
	   The council was expected to take action on the draft within the
week.

BBC report: Taliban leader says U.S. must compensate and apologize
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Mullah Omar, Afghanistan's Taliban militia leader,
says he will not talk with the United States about international
terrorism unless Washington makes concessions for its recent
airstrikes, according to the British Broadcasting Corp.
	   Omar rebuffed the idea of entering into a dialogue with the
United States, the BBC said Tuesday, citing comments to a news
agency in Afghanistan it did not name.
	   ``There is now nothing left to negotiate following the
airstrikes unless the Americans pay compensation and apologize,''
the BBC quoted Omar as saying.
	   The United States launched airstrikes Aug. 20 in Sudan and
Afghanistan that were aimed at Osama bin Laden, a Saudi millionaire
and Islamic militant linked to the bombings of two U.S. embassies
in East Africa this month.
	   Bin Laden has lived in exile since 1996 in a region of southern
Afghanistan controlled by the Taliban.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraq strongly denies U.S. intelligence
charges that it worked with Sudanese scientists at a Khartoum plant
to build chemical weapons projects, the Iraqi ambassador said
Tuesday.
	   Iraq's only contact with the pharmaceutical factory was to fill
pharmaceutical contracts, Nizar Hamdoon told reporters. The U.S.
charges are ``part of the effort to try to muddle the whole
situation in order to cover up the problem that they've had with
the bombing of the Sudan,'' Hamdoon said.

Serbs accused of killing three charity workers in Kosovo

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police let an ethnic Albanian
food convoy to refugees of the Kosovo conflict pass their
checkpoint then shelled it, killing three aid workers, a survivor
of the alleged attack said Tuesday.
	   The Mother Teresa humanitarian organization said the three were
killed Monday after police allowed them to pass through a
checkpoint near Malisevo, a former rebel stronghold in central
Kosovo that Serb forces overran last month.
	   The survivor was identified as Mustafe Krasniqi by a spokesman
for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, the main international
aid organization in Kosovo.
	   The spokesman, Fernando del Mundo, told The Associated Press
that Krasniqi was unhurt except for minor burns suffered while
trying to snatch aid packages from the trailer he was pulling with
a tractor, after police set it afire.
	   The Serbs raked Krasniqi's tractor with sub-machine gun fire
after the shell landed on another tractor about 500 meters (yards)
away from him, killing two aid workers instantly and mortally
wounding the third, said del Mundo.
	   There was no immediate comment from Serbian authorities on the
alleged attack.
	   Del Mundo said both Krasniqi and local villagers said the
seven-tractor convoy was deliberately targeted. Shells continued
landing in the area for about 15 minutes after the one that killed
the three aid workers, they reportedly said.
	   The charity, based in Kosovo, is responsible for the bulk of
humanitarian assistance to the province, distributing such items as
wheat flour and soap. It is not affiliated with the Sisters of
Charity, Mother Teresa's India-based missionary order.
	   The Pristina daily Koha Ditore and the Albanians' Kosovo
Information Center gave similar accounts.
	   In Belgrade, U.S. envoy Christopher Hill met with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic as part of on-going shuttle diplomacy.
	   After the meeting Milosevic issued a defiant statement,
demanding the United States lift its economic embargo against
Yugoslavia, saying government crackdown against the Albanian
militants was ``necessary.''
	   ``President Milosevic said that if America honestly wishes good
to this part of Europe, then it should lift the sanctions and
limitations that obstruct free development and in the long run
cause big economic and humanitarian difficulties,'' said the
statement, carried by the state-run Tanjug news agency.
	   Milosevic said Kosovo problem can only be solved by peaceful
means, but added ``fighting terrorism presents a necessary
condition for stabilization of the situation.''
	   He also said that humanitarian activities of the International
Committee of the Red Cross and the U.N. refugee agency ``should be
fully tied'' with the government activities to normalize the
situation in the areas where people have been displaced.

	   U.S. and British officials announced their proposal Monday in a
bid to end a 10-year impasse over the bombing, which killed 259
people aboard Pan Am Flight 103 and 11 people on the ground at
Lockerbie, Scotland.
	   Libya has refused to turn two suspects over, fearing they
couldn't get a fair trial in the United States or Scotland.
	   According to the draft, the council would welcome the
U.S.-British proposal and demand that the Libyan government ensure
that the two suspects appear for trial in the Netherlands along
with any witnesses or evidence.
	   The resolution is required because the original document that
imposed sanctions on Libya six years ago stipulated that the trial
would take place in the United States or the United Kingdom.

WRU replaces Cardiff and Swansea in premier division
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CARDIFF, Wales (AP) _ The Welsh Rugby Union has refused to
sanction cross-border matches for Cardiff and Swansea and has
dropped the two rebel clubs from its domestic competition.
	   Cardiff and Swansea, which refused to sign a 10-year loyalty
agreement with the WRU in favor of a proposed British league, have
scheduled friendly matches against England's 14 leading clubs.
	   The English First Division Rugby clubs have so far stood firm on
an arrangement for weekly matches against the two powerful Welsh
clubs but England's RFU has not ratified the proposed season
schedule.
	   Cardiff and Swansea, which last week withdrew from the Welsh
premier division, have been replaced by Newport and Aberavon.
	   The WRU released a statement Tuesday confirming it would seek
legal advice before deciding on further sanctions against the two
breakaway clubs.
	   ``Further investigations on the legal implications of their
withdrawal from the Premier Division will take place before
consideration is given to further sanctions,'' the statement said.

Kabila returns to capital, plans attacks in Congo's east
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quote from Kabila, Zimbabwean defense ministry
statement. Edits throughout to trim. No pickup. &QL;

 &UR; By IAN STEWART &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Fortified by the support of allied troops
and air support, President Laurent Kabila returned with fanfare to
Congo's capital Tuesday while the government prepared to strike at
the heart of rebel-held territory in the east.
	   Kabila's motorcade _ a caravan of black limousines flanked by
pickup trucks filled with commandos _ zipped through Kinshasa's
rutted streets past cheering and waving crowds. Kabila had been
away from the city for more than week.
	   His return came as allied warplanes from Angola and Zimbabwe
staged a series of attacks on rebel positions, Information Minister
Didier Mumengi said. He declined to give details.
	   In eastern Congo, rebel officials said Angolan and Zimbabwean
aircraft had bombed the rebel-held city of Kisangani and the town
of Kasangulu, 30 kilometers (15 miles) south of Kinshasa.
	   Bizima Karaha, a top rebel official, said the planes had bombed
civilian targets in Kisangani, Congo's third-largest city. The city
was captured by rebels in recent days.
	   ``They cannot recapture Kisangani, only bomb it from the air,''
he said. ``This is terrorism.''
	   A string of victories by Congolese soldiers and their Angolan
allies in the western corridor that stretches from Kinshasa to the
Atlantic Ocean have put the rebels on the defensive.
	   In the wake of those gains, the government said it is planning
on moving east into rebel areas.
	   Kabila, speaking on state-run radio, called for support among
the Congolese.
	   ``With hands or spears or by any means the people must crush the
enemy in our territory,'' he said.
	   Amid the threat of fighting shifting to the east, Roman Catholic
Church officials in Rome said Tutsi rebels in eastern Congo had
attacked a Catholic mission crowded with war refugees, killing 37
people.
	   A priest, three nuns and a seminary student died alongside 32
refugees, the Vatican's missionary news service reported. The
attack happened Sunday in the remote parish of Kasika, about 80
kilometers northwest of Uvira in South Kivu province.
	   The rebels attacked because they suspected local people of
giving food to a pro-government militia, the news service said.
	   All the dead were Congolese.
	   In southwestern Congo, meanwhile, Angolan forces fighting on
behalf of Kabila have re-captured a string of towns the rebels had
taken, reportedly including the Congo River port of Matadi _ though
rebel officials deny the town has fallen.
	   Rebel fighters _ a coalition of ethnic Tutsi gunmen and
disenchanted members of Kabila's military _ were holed up in the
town of Inga, Angolan radio reported.
	   Inga, about 50 kilometers north of Matadi, is the site of a
major power dam that supplies Kinshasa with electricity.
	   The rebels in the west are now trapped between Angolan forces in
the southwest and Zimbabwean troops defending Kinshasa's southern
outskirts.
	   Zimbabwean troops have quickly become heavily involved in the
fighting, that country's defense ministry said in a statement,
repulsing an attack by rebels southwest of Kinshasa and helping to
destroy rebel convoy headed toward the capital.
	   ``A number of attacks and counter-attacks have been launched
with the aim of pushing the rebels back and denying them time to
reorganize,'' the ministry said.
	   It said Angolan troops were advancing through southwestern Congo
after capturing the rebel strongholds of Kitona and Matadi and
would soon join up with Congolese, Namibian and Zimbabwean units
for a ``co-offensive'' directed from Kinshasa.
	   The statement gave few details, except for saying the rebel
convoy had been destroyed late last week near Madimba, about 74
kilometers south of Kinshasa.
	   Rwanda _ considered the rebels' main military and political
sponsor _ says it will intervene in the conflict if the Zimbabweans
and Angolans do not withdraw.
	   Uganda has also sent troops and tanks in support of the
insurgents.
	   Fighting broke out earlier this month when members of Kabila's
armed forces revolted after the president ordered all Rwandan
troops out of the country.
	   The Rwandan soldiers _ the core of Kabila's rebel movement that
ousted Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko last _ had stayed on in
Congo as part of the national defense force.
	   The government on Monday rejected a cease-fire plan drafted in
South Africa by member states of the Southern African Development
Community. Kabila insists a cease-fire can come only after Rwandan
and Ugandan forces leave Congo.
	   In Kinshasa, the government released a Worldwide Television News
crew that had been detained for several days.
	   Journalists in Kinshasa have been repeatedly detained and
harassed by authorities, who accuse the Western media of a
pro-rebel bias.

Government presents 1999 budget draft
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ The government on Tuesday presented a
draft budget for 1999 which managed to stay in the black for the
third consecutive year, but holds a surplus considerably lower than
the projected 1998 surplus.
	   Declining unemployment and lower interest payments on state debt
have helped to lighten government expenditure. Next year's spending
is expected to be 393 billion kroner (dlrs 56.1 billion), or about
8 billion kroner (dlrs 1.1 billion) less than in 1998.
	   Unemployment is at 6.5 percent of the work force, one of the
lowest in Europe.
	   Social Democratic Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen's Cabinet
expects a 1.7 billion kroner (dlrs 243,000 million) budget surplus
in 1999, significantly down from 27 billion (dlrs 3.9 billion)
estimated for this year.
	   The minority government said it was aware of the dangers of
overheating next year, as the Danish economy charges into its sixth
continuous year of expansion.
	   In June, parliament approved a package of national budget
revisions intended to cool off the economy. The move came after the
Central Bank and independent economists began calling for fiscal
restraint, warning that the economy would overheat.

	   Libya has made no formal comment on the proposal.
	   On Tuesday, the head of the Arab League, Esmat Abdel Meguid,
said Libya would probably accept the deal because it was
``compatible with previous suggestions, which Libya has accepted.''
	   U.S. and British officials have threatened Libya with more
sanctions if it doesn't accept the deal and produce the suspects,
Abdel Basset al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, in a timely
manner.
	   Current sanctions against Libya include an air embargo and curbs
on arms sales and on certain financial and travel activities.
	   Under the deal announced Monday, the United States and Britain
agreed to accept a trial by a panel of three Scottish judges under
Scottish law in The Hague.
	   The deal also stipulates that the suspects cannot be extradited
from The Netherlands and that if found guilty, they would serve
their sentences in the United Kingdom.

Report: Militants kill six border guards; Moroccan arms connection
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with newspaper reporting border guards killed, arms
pipeline from Moroccan militants
 &UR; By RACHID KHIARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Muslim militants ambushed and killed six
western Algerian border guards in a mountainous region where
residents say the militants smuggle arms from Morocco, a newspaper
reported Tuesday.
	   Members of the Armed Islamic Group attacked two of the guards'
vehicles before dawn Monday near the town of Ain Sefra, killing the
guards, the independent daily Liberte reported, quoting
unidentified residents.
	   The newspaper also quoted the residents as saying the militants
had organized a network to smuggle arms through the mountains and
forests in the region.
	   The arms, the paper reported, came from a Moroccan sheik known
only as Noualni. European media in recent weeks have also reported
evidence from European police sweeps of a Moroccan connection to
the Algerian insurgency.
	   Meanwhile, rescue workers and family members said militants
killed six youths they lured into a tunnel complex used by the
group, known as the GIA. The youths ranged in age from 12 to 15,
said the rescue workers, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The youths were stabbed and shot by an armed group in a tunnel
leading from the Saint Raphael Gardens to a nearby boulevard. The
tunnel extends over four kilometers (2.5 miles) on four levels with
at least four exits.
	   The government did not report either incident, and there was no
claim of responsibility for either attack.
	   But suspicion fell on the Armed Islamic Group trying to oust the
military-backed regime.
	   The GIA has been known to use the tunnel as well as other
underground passages and the city's sewers to move about the
capital.
	   At the beginning of this year, Algerian authorities closed most
of the entrances to the tunnels and to the sewer network.
	   The six victims lived in the center of Algiers. According to a
sister of one of the victims, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
they had been led into the tunnel by a ``friend.''
	   The El Biar neighborhood, where the bodies were found, has many
embassies and has been rarely struck by the violence that has
claimed at least 75,000 lives since 1992.
	   The unrest was triggered by the decision of the authorities to
cancel parliamentary elections that the now banned Islamic
Salvation Front was set to win.

Bosnian Croats snub German diplomat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Bosnian Croats in this tense
central Bosnian town snubbed German diplomat Hans Schumacher, who
tried Tuesday to arrange the return of Muslim refugees to villages
in central Bosnia, officials said.
	   Several hundred Muslim refugees, who fled from the region during
the war in 1993, attempted to return to their homes last month, but
were forced out again by a Croat mob.
	   Schumacher, a deputy to Bosnia's top international mediator,
Carlos Westendorp, went to Vitez in central Bosnia Tuesday, trying
to persuade local Croat leaders to accept the second return of
Muslim refugees.
	   Instead, he heard charges that the international community was
biased in favor of the Muslims rather than the Croats.
	   ``The meeting did not work out well,'' said Alexandra
Stiglmayer, a spokeswoman for Schumacher. ``They were very upset
and not very friendly.''
	   One of the Croat women present at the meeting reportedly told
Schumacher, ``We will do the same to you as we did to Koschnik.''
Hans Koschnik was another German mediator, who was attacked by a
Croat mob in southern town of Mostar in 1996. He was not injured,
but his armored car was badly damaged.
	   Stiglmayer said Schumacher did not feel threatened but holds the
ruling Croat HDZ party responsible for the negative outcome of the
meeting because he had received assurances from the party that the
issue would be solved.
	   In the next few days, international mediators will decide how to
approach the problem in Vitez, Stiglmayer said.

movement.
	   Pakistan has been accused to assisting the Taliban movement, but
both Pakistan and the Taliban have denied such accusations.
	   Pakistani Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Mohammed
Siddique Kanju, who visited Tajikistan on Tuesday as part of a tour
of Central Asia, also called for foreign nations to negotiate with
the Taliban in order to help establish peace, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
	   Meanwhile, Tajik President Emomali Rakhmonov, worried about a
possible spillover of violence from Afghanistan, urged the
fundamentalists and anti-Taliban opposition to stop fighting and
begin negotiations, the Interfax news agency said.
	   Russia and the former Soviet republics in Central Asia fear an
influx of refugees and weapons across their borders from
Afghanistan, and possibly a spillover of fighting.

Report: Militants kill six border guards; Moroccan arms connection
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with newspaper reporting border guards killed, arms
pipeline from Moroccan militants
 &UR; By RACHID KHIARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Muslim militants ambushed and killed six
western Algerian border guards in a mountainous region where
residents say the militants smuggle arms from Morocco, a newspaper
reported Tuesday.
	   Members of the Armed Islamic Group attacked two of the guards'
vehicles before dawn Monday near the town of Ain Sefra, killing the
guards, the independent daily Liberte reported, quoting
unidentified residents.
	   The newspaper also quoted the residents as saying the militants
had organized a network to smuggle arms through the mountains and
forests in the region.
	   The arms, the paper reported, came from a Moroccan sheik known
only as Noualni. European media in recent weeks have also reported
evidence from European police sweeps of a Moroccan connection to
the Algerian insurgency.
	   Meanwhile, rescue workers and family members said militants
killed six youths they lured into a tunnel complex used by the
group, known as the GIA. The youths ranged in age from 12 to 15,
said the rescue workers, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The youths were stabbed and shot by an armed group in a tunnel
leading from the Saint Raphael Gardens to a nearby boulevard. The
tunnel extends over four kilometers (2.5 miles) on four levels with
at least four exits.
	   The government did not report either incident, and there was no
claim of responsibility for either attack.
	   But suspicion fell on the Armed Islamic Group trying to oust the
military-backed regime.
	   The GIA has been known to use the tunnel as well as other
underground passages and the city's sewers to move about the
capital.
	   At the beginning of this year, Algerian authorities closed most
of the entrances to the tunnels and to the sewer network.
	   The six victims lived in the center of Algiers. According to a
sister of one of the victims, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
they had been led into the tunnel by a ``friend.''
	   The El Biar neighborhood, where the bodies were found, has many
embassies and has been rarely struck by the violence that has
claimed at least 75,000 lives since 1992.
	   The unrest was triggered by the decision of the authorities to
cancel parliamentary elections that the now banned Islamic
Salvation Front was set to win.

Peace deal may be in reach but tensions still simmer in Hebron
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS for AMs. UPDATES with firebombs thrown at Israeli
troops, settler home; INCORPORATES material from
Israel-Settlements &QL; 
 &UR; By NASSER SHIYOUKHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ An elusive peace deal between Israel
and the Palestinians seemed to be closer at hand Tuesday, but in
troubled Hebron tensions boiled over when Jewish settlers stoned
and pushed Palestinians after Israel briefly lifted a curfew.
	   ``Go home, go home,'' settlers shouted as Palestinians tried to
make their way past a Jewish enclave in the center of town.
	   Israeli soldiers detained a woman settler and escorted
Palestinian pedestrians to safety while trying to push back about
30 settlers.
	   Tempers have been raging since the stabbing death of a
well-known rabbi last week, apparently by a Palestinian, in a small
Hebron trailer park for Jewish settlers known as Tel Romeida.
	   During a temporary lifting of an Israeli army curfew on 30,0000
Palestinians imposed since the attack, many rushed to stock up on
basic food supplies but they encountered angry settlers who hurled
stones towards them, pushed and cursed them.
	   The settlers also pelted eggs at a group of Palestinian
journalists, hitting an Associated Press staffer and a cameraman
from Reuters.
	   Later, three firebombs were thrown toward Israeli troops and a
fourth at a settler home. No injuries were reported.
	   The violence came at a time when Israel and the Palestinians
were reportedly closing-in on a deal for an Israeli troop
withdrawal in the West Bank after a 17-month stalemate.
	   The progress worries settlers, who oppose ceding any land. Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who enjoys crucial support from a
strong Jewish settler lobby, paid a surprise visit Tuesday to
Hebron's settlers and promised to build new homes for the 450 Jews
living in the divided city of 130,000 Palestinians.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat called the plan a violation of
agreements between the two sides.
	   Meanwhile, a Housing Ministry document revealed that a quarter
of the settlement homes built by a previous hardline Israeli
government in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip between 1989 and
1992 still stand empty.
	   The figures appear to undermine claims by Netanyahu's government
that more construction in Jewish settlements is necessary to
accommodate population growth.
	   Netanyahu's senior aide, David Bar-Illan, said that while in
outlying settlements some homes are empty, in many other
communities there was waiting lists for people trying to move in.
	   The United States has asked Israel to halt construction in
settlements, which it says undermine peace efforts. The
Palestinians want to establish an independent state on West Bank
and Gaza land and expect Israel to carry out troop withdrawals it
committed to in peace accords
	   Both sides reported progress in a set of over night meetings in
Oslo, Norway where negotiators marked the fifth anniversary of
their first peace agreement.
	   But difference still remain and Arafat told reporters upon
returning to his Gaza headquarters Tuesday that that he was still
waiting for the Israelis to agree to a United States withdrawal
plan for Israeli troops to pullback from 13 percent of West Bank
territory.

Catholic bishops meet to discuss Auschwitz cross controversy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CZESTOCHOWA, Poland (AP) _ Catholic bishops began a two-day
meeting Tuesday to discuss the controversy over scores of crosses
erected in recent weeks near the Auschwitz Nazi death camp.
	   The meeting of the Council of the Episcopate, at Poland's
holiest Catholic shrine, was expected to decide the church's policy
on the crosses, which are opposed by Jewish groups.
	   It was unclear if any announcement would come before the meeting
concludes Wednesday.
	   More than 100 crosses have been set up by Poles in a field
bordering Auschwitz in recent weeks to protest Jewish demands to
remove a larger cross that has stood on the site for almost a
decade.
	   The larger cross was used during a 1979 Mass celebrated by Pope
John Paul II at Birkenau, the sister camp of Auschwitz. It
commemorates 152 Poles killed by Nazis on the site in 1941.
	   Jewish groups say the large cross, which can be seen from inside
Auschwitz, disturbs the memory of the more than 1 million Jews
killed at Auschwitz-Birkenau by the Nazis.
	   Cardinal Jozef Glemp, the head of the Catholic church in Poland,
has called the smaller crosses a political provocation by
irresponsible people but said the papal cross should stay. Prime
Minister Jerzy Buzek's government agrees with Glemp's position, and
the bishops were expected to also endorse that stance.
	   Other issues to be discussed at the conference in Czestochowa,
180 kilometers (110 miles) southwest of Warsaw, include John Paul's
planned visit to Poland next year, a church spokesman said.

`No more Omaghs,' Blair vows as he plans sterner anti-terror laws
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW throughout for AMs &QL; 
 &UR; With AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OMAGH, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Prime Minister Tony Blair, on his
first visit to this bomb-shattered town, promised Tuesday that the
United Kingdom will toughen its anti-terrorist powers so that ``the
future contains no more Omaghs.''
	   Standing amid the boarded-up, gutted downtown where Irish
Republican Army dissidents slaughtered 28 people and wounded 330
others 10 days ago, Blair announced that Parliament would be
recalled Sept. 2 to approve what he called ``draconian and
fundamental'' bills.
	   His proposals _ announced after shaking hands and saying ``I'm
so sorry'' to hundreds of appreciative residents in drizzling rain
_ would end the right to silence for those accused of organizing
bomb or gun attacks in opposition to April's multi-party peace
agreement.
	   They closely mirror proposed laws that the Irish government
intends to enact at its own emergency parliamentary session before
U.S. President Bill Clinton arrives Sept. 3 to tour Northern
Ireland and the Irish Republic.
	   Blair said the new British law would allow testimony of senior
detectives to be used to convict people of belonging to outlawed
paramilitary groups, something that has normally been difficult to
do.
	   In conjunction with that new power, he said, judges would be
able to infer guilt if a person charged with membership ``refused
to answer any question in the course of interrogation.'' Members of
paramilitary groups often maintain disciplined silence when
questioned.
	   Blair admitted these plans were ``of a very draconian and
fundamental nature. But we think they are right and justified in
these circumstances.''
	   He said IRA dissidents and other armed opponents of the peace
accord were ``outcasts from the community. And people rightly
expect that we will take whatever measures we can, properly and
legitimately, to bring those responsible to justice.''
	   The government also will ask Parliament to pass legislation
making it an offense to conspire in Britain to commit terrorist
offenses in another country.
	   This legislation ``has been strongly pressed upon us by many
states who are concerned at what they believe to be U.K.-based
nationals of their countries using the U.K. to plan terrorist acts
abroad,'' Blair said.
	   Most local politicians, Protestant and Catholic alike, have
demanded decisive government action in the wake of the Omagh attack
_ the deadliest in 30 years of bloodshed in Northern Ireland.
	   ``If we're to have peace, there is no method too stringent,''
said moderate Catholic politician Paddy McGowan, gesturing to
passing Omagh pedestrians and noting that most were related to
somebody killed or wounded in the blast.
	   ``The prime minister, like so many people in the town, was at a
loss for words. It was obvious that he had a deep sense of the hurt
we've suffered,'' said Tom Watterson, who talked privately with
Blair when the prime minister walked into his drapery shop. Three
of his employees were killed and another was critically wounded in
the blast.
	   Sinn Fein politicians criticized Blair's proposals, and Omagh
council members from the IRA-allied party avoided the prime
minister's visit.
	   Sinn Fein chief negotiator Martin McGuinness, a reputed former
IRA commander instrumental in delivering the outlawed group's July
1997 cease-fire, criticized his plans as ``a grievous mistake'' and
``crazy.''
	   McGuinness, speaking before he met Blair later in Belfast, said
Sinn Fein supporters loathed and distrusted Northern Ireland's
predominantly Protestant police force. He said the Royal Ulster
Constabulary ``should be disbanded, not given additional repressive
powers to convict potentially innocent people at will.''
	   Fifty-six people remained hospitalized in the wake of the Omagh
bomb, including three in critical condition in Belfast.

Gunmen kill five Maoist rebels in Bangladesh

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Dissident members of a Maoist rebel
group shot dead five of their former comrades in a southwestern
village Tuesday, police said.
	   Police found bodies of the five guerrillas in an abandoned house
in Aranghata village in Khulna district, 85 miles (136 kilometers)
southwest of Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital. Police said they
belonged to the outlawed East Bengal Proletariat Party.
	   Maoist rebels have little popular support in predominantly
Muslim Bangladesh. The guerrillas are campaigning for an armed
revolution to establish communism in this South Asian country.

Bangladesh lodges protest with India on attempted deportation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Bangladesh Tuesday lodged a protest
with India against New Delhi's reported move to push
Bengali-speaking people into its territory, the state-run BSS news
agency said.
	   Foreign Secretary Mustafiur Rahman summoned Indian High
Commissioner Deb Mukherjee to his office to hand over the protest
note, the agency reported.
	   Neither Rahman nor the Indian envoy were immediately available
for comment.
	   Rahman told the Indian envoy that no illegal migrant from
Bangladesh lived in India and any deportation would affect
excellent relations between the two countries, BSS said.
	   Last weekend, Indian border troops failed to push at least 16
Bengali-speaking people into Bangladesh because of resistance from
its frontier guards, officials in the national capital Dhaka said.
	   New Delhi claims that thousands of poor Bangladeshis cross the
border in search of jobs in neighboring India.
	   The claim is difficult to prove because citizens in the Indian
state of West Bengal speak Bengali, which is also the mother tongue
of the Bangladeshis. The West Bengal state borders Bangladesh.
	   On Monday, Indian border troops shot and killed a Bangaldeshi
farmer who was grazing his cattle in a rice field close to the
border in Naogaon, the site of last weekend's attempted
deportation, a Home Ministry official said.

Court says play on Gandhi's assassin can resume, but without police

protection &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) - A Bombay court Tuesday rejected a petition
asking for police protection to resume a controversial play
glorifying the assassin of Indian independence leader Mohandas
Gandhi.
	   Police had refused to give a fresh license to ``Nathuram Godse
Speaks,'' after the play was disrupted last month by violent
protesters who said it denigrated Gandhi and promoted his killer
Godse. Police said the play posed a law and order problem.
	   Pradeep Dalvi, author of the play, said he would try staging the
play in early September and had appealed to the court for police
protection.
	   Judges S.S. Nichar and Ashok Agarwal of the Bombay High Court
said the play could be performed in the absence of formal
government orders banning the play, but no police protection would
be ordered.
	   If protests occurred during the play, the police would step in
to control it as a matter of course, the judges said, according to
the Press Trust of India.
	   Gandhi's supporters have accused the Maharashtra state
government, of which Bombay is the capital, of covertly supporting
Godse and the radical Hindu philosophy that he subscribed to.
Maharashtra is ruled by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata
Party and the right-wing Shiv Sena party.
	   Dalvi has argued that the play throws light on Godse, who was
hanged for shooting Gandhi at a 1948 prayer meeting. Godse was
against Gandhi favoring Muslims after the colonial British rulers
partitioned India into predominantly Hindu India and officially
Islamic Pakistan.
	   The play was suspended after five performances in the popular
Marathi language. It had been staged 80 times in the past year in
the regional Gujarati language.

Investigators still looking at Henri Paul's blood
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details on carbon monoxide poisoning; quotes from
doctor; details of statement; name of second Ritz manager
questioned; edits. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Nearly a year after Princess Diana's death,
investigators are still examining the blood of driver Henri Paul _
this time not for alcohol, but to explain an abnormally high level
of carbon monoxide.
	   The revelation came in a rare statement issued Tuesday by
prosecutors in the case, in which they also said the investigation
would end in October.
	   Its release came after a day in which two key witnesses were
questioned by Judge Herve Stephan: the president of the Ritz Hotel,
Frank Klein, and its director, Claude Roulet.
	   It was the first time Stephan, who heads the investigation, had
questioned Ritz management. No details of the questioning were
immediately available.
	   The Ritz is owned by Mohamed Al Fayed _ father of Dodi Fayed,
who died in the Aug. 31 crash that also killed Diana and driver
Paul.
	   The Ritz rented the Mercedes that night from the Etoile
Limousine company. Questions have recently been raised as to
whether the car had faulty brakes _ and whether the Ritz was warned
about this.
	   The prosecutors' office said it released its statement Tuesday
because of a crush of media queries surrounding the anniversary of
Diana's death.
	   It was the first statement prosecutors had issued since the
early days of the case, when they described the elevated alcohol
level in Paul's blood, and only the third of the case.
	   Repeated blood tests found Paul was heavily drunk at the time of
the crash. That, and the high speed he was believed traveling at,
always have been assumed to be major reasons for the crash.
	   Three tests are still under way in the investigation, the
statement said, including one on ``the origin of the level of
carbon monoxide, slightly higher than average, found in the blood
of driver Henri Paul.''
	   It isn't clear what could cause the high level. But carbon
monoxide poisoning can cause dizziness, headaches, nausea and
disorientation. If very serious, it can lead to a coma.
	   The statement did not give Paul's carbon monoxide level. Time
Magazine reported this week that the level was 20.7 percent.
	   Heavy smokers have up to 20 percent in their blood, and over 30
percent can be considered toxic, said Dr. Claude Guez, a general
physician in Paris. Paul reportedly was not known to be a heavy
smoker.
	   ``A normal, healthy person doesn't not have carbon monoxide in
their blood, unless they're smoking two packs a day or working in
an underground garage with no ventilation,'' Guez said.
	   Investigators also are looking into the medical care Diana
received, the statement said. There have been claims by some
doctors, especially in the United States, that she would have had a
better chance if rushed right away to the hospital rather than
treated first on the scene. Others, including Frederic Mailliez,
the first doctor to treat her, say that would have made no
difference.
	   The third test is being carried out on the body of the wrecked
Mercedes, at a lab outside Paris. As part of that, investigators
are believed to be looking at whether the front air bags may have
inflated before the car struck the tunnel's pillar.
	   The statement said all these tests should be completed by the
end of October.
	   Among other details it provided:
	   _ More than 60 police officers were mobilized during the first
72 hours after the crash.
	   _ Police interviewed 153 people as potential witnesses to the
crash. The two judges _ Stephan and Marie-Christine Devidal _ have
themselves questioned about 50.
	   _ Police also questioned almost 3,000 owners of Fiat Unos, in an
effort to find the car believed to have brushed against the
Mercedes before it crashed. Although the statement didn't say so,
police are thought to have basically given up the search.
	   The statement tried to explain what many have wondered _ why the
investigation has taken so long.
	   ``Because of the context of this case, and its international
repercussions, the proceedings have been delayed by the necessity
of verifying a great deal of testimony, much of which has been
proven unusable or fantastical,'' it said.

Draft: Libya sanctions suspended once suspects appear for trial

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council would agree to
suspend U.N. sanctions against Libya as soon as two Libyan suspects
in the 1988 Pan Am bombing arrive in the Netherlands for trial,
according to a draft resolution Tuesday.
	   The U.S.-British-sponsored draft also says Libya must satisfy
the French judicial inquiry into the bombing of another flight, UTA
772, before the sanctions are suspended.
	   That flight, from Brazzaville, Republic of Congo, to Paris,
exploded over the Niger desert on Sept. 19, 1989, killing all of
170 the passengers and crew. In January, France's top terrorism
judge named six suspects _ including Libyan leader Moammar
Ghadafi's brother-in-law _ in the explosion.
	   The draft circulated as the council began preliminary
consultations Tuesday on a deal to try the two Pan Am flight
suspects at The Hague using Scottish judges.
	   Deputy U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh said he hoped the council
would take action on the resolution in ``the next day or two.''
	   ``So we are expecting that Libya will agree with this process
and very promptly produce the two accused after the council adopts
the resolution,'' Burleigh said.
	   U.S. and British officials announced their proposal Monday in a
bid to end a 10-year impasse over the Pan Am bombing, which killed
259 people aboard Pan Am Flight 103 and 11 people on the ground at
Lockerbie, Scotland.
	   Libya has refused to turn two suspects over, fearing they would
not get a fair trial in the United States or Scotland.
	   According to the draft, the council would welcome the
U.S.-British proposal and demand that the Libyan government ensure
that the two suspects appear for trial in the Netherlands along
with any witnesses or evidence.
	   The resolution is required because the original sanctions,
imposed six years ago, stipulate that the trial take place in the
United States or the United Kingdom.
	   Libya has made no formal comment on the proposal.
	   On Tuesday, the head of the Arab League, Esmat Abdel Meguid,
said Libya would probably accept the deal because it was
``compatible with previous suggestions, which Libya has accepted.''
	   U.S. and British officials have threatened Libya with more
sanctions if it doesn't accept the deal and produce the suspects,
Abdel Basset al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, in a timely
manner.
	   Current sanctions against Libya include an air embargo and curbs
on arms sales and on certain financial and travel activities.
	   Under the deal announced Monday, the United States and Britain
agreed to accept a trial by a panel of three Scottish judges under
Scottish law in The Hague.
	   The deal also stipulates that the suspects cannot be extradited
from The Netherlands and that if found guilty, they would serve
their sentences in the United Kingdom.

Russia plans debt structuring, considers coalition with Communists

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government battled Tuesday to pull the
country out of economic and political crisis, extending its debt
repayments and signaling that some hard-line opponents may be given
top posts.
	   However, in a sign that hopes of a recovery continue to crumble,
the ruble plummeted 10 percent in trading Tuesday _ its biggest
one-day plunge in nearly four years.
	   The currency closed at 7.86 to the dollar, down from 7.14 on
Monday. Trading was suspended twice when the Central Bank was
overwhelmed by demand for dollars.
	   Russia's crisis has raised alarms around the world. U.S.
President Bill Clinton phoned Boris Yeltsin and expressed support
for his efforts to fix the economy, White House officials said. But
they indicated that the United States' interest is in promoting
reform, not individual leaders.
	   Clinton is scheduled to arrive in Moscow in less than a week for
a summit with Yeltsin.
	   The Russian government has been struggling to contain the
crisis, which began in early summer when the stock market went into
a deep skid and hit a low point when the Central Bank effectively
devalued the ruble last week. The Russian economy has been wracked
by the global emerging markets crisis and the drop in oil prices,
its main export.
	   Last week the government also effectively defaulted on its
short-term debt, announcing that holders of dlrs 40 billion in
treasury bills _ dlrs 11 billion of it held by foreigners _ would
have to accept a new repayment plan.
	   Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin approved that plan
Tuesday. Under the terms, investors whose bonds have matured will
have the option of swapping them either for long-term dollar
denominated paper with a very modest return, or much
higher-yielding paper denominated in rubles.
	   Last weekend Yeltsin reinstated Chernomyrdin, the long-time
former prime minister he fired five months ago, in the hope that a
well-known face and political ``heavyweight'' will restore
confidence at home and abroad. His nomination must still be
approved by parliament.
	   ``There has never been such a low percentage of people who
believe in the government in all of Russia's years of reform,''
said Mikhail Gorshkov, an analyst at the Independent Institute of
Social and National Problems, a leading polling agency.
	   Chernomyrdin suggested Tuesday that one way to mend relations
with the hard-line lower house of parliament, the State Duma, would
be to give in to their calls for a ``government of accord'' with
prominent jobs given to Communists and other Yeltsin foes.
	   The Communists, parliament's largest faction, have long called
for such a coalition government. In previous political crises
Yeltsin has appointed a few Communists to the Cabinet, but
Chernomyrdin appeared to indicate the intention this time would be
more sweeping.
	   Altogether, only three members of the Communist Party have
served in the Cabinet since the Soviet collapse. The latest
appointment came last month, when Yeltsin appointed Yuri Maslyukov,
the former chairman of Soviet Gosplan state planning agency, as
minister of trade and industry.
	   Both previous Communist appointments were short-lived. Justice
Minister Valentin Kovalyov lasted just two years, fired in 1997
after he was filmed with nude models in a sauna. Siberian governor
Aman Tuleyev was named minister in charge of relations with the
former Soviet republics in 1996, but was fired a year later.
	   These appointments were largely seen as an attempt by Yeltsin to
placate the Communist-dominated Duma, but he continually rejected
their calls for a coalition government.
	   Other developments Tuesday:
	   _ Stocks rose in thin trading. The Russian Trading System (RTS)
index closed at 88.38 points, up 2.3 percent from Monday's close at
86.40. Trading volume was tiny at dlrs 8.5 million.
	   _ Three of the nation's leading banks _ Oneximbank, Bank Menatep
and Most Bank _ announced a merger in an apparent attempt to
prevent an acute liquidity crisis by combining their assets. Most
Russian banks have found themselves in a difficult position after
last week's devaluation because of overdependence on ruble assets.
	   _ The French petroleum company Elf Aquitaine decided to abandon
a proposed alliance with Russia's Sibneft worth dlrs 500 million
because of economic instability in Russia and low world oil prices.

WWF: 10 percent of tree species under extinction threat
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: World Wide Fund for Nature is known as World Wildlife Fund in
North America. &QL; 
 &UR; By GEIR MOULSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ One-tenth of the world's known species of trees
are in danger of extinction, with some species already reduced to
fewer than 100 trees left, the World Wide Fund for Nature and other
groups said in a study published Tuesday.
	   Fewer than one in four of the trees in danger benefit from
protection efforts, according to the 650-page ``World List of
Threatened Trees'' report, which resulted from a three-year
collaboration between the World Conservation Monitoring Center,
World Conservation Union and WWF. The report was financed by the
Dutch government.
	   It reported that 8,753 of the world's estimated 80,000 to
100,000 tree species _ around 80 percent of which are found in the
tropics _ are either vulnerable or under critical threat.
	   Some 1,000 were classed as ``critically endangered,'' reduced to
tens of specimens.
	   ``It's scary, there's no other word for it,'' Jean-Paul
Jeanrenaud, head of WWF's forest program, said.
	   The report was released at the start of a two-week meeting in
Geneva of a U.N. forum on forests, at which government delegations
will discuss measures to slow down deforestation.
	   Jeanrenaud called on governments to take responsibility for
better forest management and tree protection.
	   He pointed to a pledge by 22 countries to protect a minimum 10
percent of their forests by the year 2000, as one example of
possible action.
	   Among the most threatened species listed in the report are three
of which only one specimen is known to remain, all due to loss of
their natural habitat.
	   A group of four Hibiscus clayi trees in Hawaii's Nounou
mountains appears to be the only remaining population of that
species, the study said. It cited invasive plants as one threat.
	   And grazing by goats is thought to be responsible for the
reduction of another species, Scalesia atractyloides, to three
trees in a crater on Ecuador's Galapagos islands.
	   Illegal cutting of trees is at fault for the disappearance of
other species such as a rare whitebeam, now reduced to around 30
trees in southwest England, the study said.
	   More than 1,000 species are threatened as a result of felling,
it claimed. Farming and expansion of human settlement were thought
to threaten some 900 and 750 species respectively, while grazing
and uncontrolled forest fires were cited as other major threats.
	   The organizations warned that species are being eliminated that
haven't yet been investigated scientifically.
	   ``Forest destruction is the key threat to species worldwide,''
said Mark Collins of the World Conservation Monitoring Center,
which compiled the report.

Draft: Libya sanctions suspended once suspects appear for trial

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council would agree to

	   Current sanctions against Libya include an air embargo and curbs

Libya, an OPEC member.

	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ A bomb exploded inside a crowded
Planet Hollywood restaurant on Tuesday, killing one person and
injuring more than a dozen.
	   Police Senior Superintendent John Sterrenberg said the device
exploded at 7:20 p.m. inside the restaurant as it was packed with
diners, and confirmed a female had died and 15 people were injured.
The number of confirmed injured was likely to rise to 25 to 30
people, he said. Nationalities and other details on the victims
were unknown.
	   No suspects in the attack were immediately named. Police
cordoned off the restaurant in the trendy Victoria and Albert
Waterfront and were reinforced with armored cars.
	   Ambulances with sirens wailing went to the scene and soon a
crowd of onlookers and journalists gathered.
	   Explosives experts went inside.
	   ``It's not safe to enter the building at the moment,''
Sterrenberg told reporters outside the restaurant. No damage was
visible from the exterior, and Sterrenberg said he did not know
where in the restaurant the explosion occurred.

Russia announces debt restructuring plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with debt plan announcement, closing
stocks, DELETES outdated material. &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Russia-Politics &QL; 
 &UR; By JUDITH INGRAM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin approved
a plan Tuesday to restructure dlrs 40 billion in short-term debt,
including more than dlrs 11 billion in bonds held by foreign
investors.
	   The national currency, meanwhile, signaled continuing fears for
Russia's economic future, plunging 10 percent Tuesday in the worst
fall in almost four years.
	   The terms of the restructuring will require investors to switch
into much longer-term paper denominated either in rubles or
dollars.
	   Investors switching into dollars will have to accept a much
lower-yielding coupon. In return for their ruble-denominated
treasury certificates, investors would receive a dollar-denominated
bond maturing in 2006 with a 5 percent coupon.
	   Investors who elect to stay in rubles will get 3-to-5 year
bonds, with coupons on the paper declining over the years, starting
with a coupon of 30 percent annually in 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001.
The next year the coupon declines to 25 percent, and in 2003 the
coupon falls to 20 percent.
	   Announcement of the terms had been postponed twice, after
foreign investors protested that the restructuring would favor
Russian commercial banks.
	   The delay reflected Russia's political limbo following President
Boris Yeltsin's dismissal of Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko on
Sunday. On his first day in office, Chernomyrdin asked the State
Duma, the lower house of parliament, to set aside ``for the time
being'' a set of economic austerity measures that had been demanded
by international lenders and formulated by Kiriyenko's team.
	   The ruble closed at 7.86 to the dollar on Tuesday, down from
7.14 on Monday. It was the biggest plunge since October 1994.
	   The Central Bank has been selling dollars steadily in recent
sessions in an effort to slow the fall of the Russian currency. By
midday on Tuesday alone, it had already spent about dlrs 340
million to defend the ruble, traders said. Trading was suspended
twice on the interbank currency exchange when the bank was
overwhelmed by demand for dollars.
	   Three of the nation's leading banks _ Oneximbank, Bank Menatep
and Most Bank _ announced a merger on Tuesday. The merger is an
apparent attempt to prevent an acute liquidity crisis by uniting
their resources.
	   Most Russian banks have found themselves in a difficult position
after last week's devaluation of the ruble because of
overdependence on their ruble assets. More merger announcements are
expected.
	   Each of the banks will transfer 51 percent of its shares into a
new holding, which will coordinate the operations of the banks in
the merger process, and the merger will be completed by Jan. 1, a
statement from Oneximbank said.
	   Stocks rose in thin trading, despite a steady absence of foreign
investors. The Russian Trading System (RTS) index closed at 88.38
points, up 2.3 percent from Monday's close at 86.40. Trading volume
was tiny at dlrs 8.5 million.
	   The market activity was driven mostly by local investors,
speculating on quick moves in the stock prices after most Russian
blue chips plummeted amid recent financial turmoil.
	   The Russian government defaulted on its treasury debt last week,
and announced that it would force investors to swap their paper for
new, longer-term, obligations.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A fake-employment scandal in the Paris city hall
widened Tuesday when a judge placed former Prime Minister Alain
Juppe under investigation for allegedly misusing public funds,
while serving under then-Mayor Jacques Chirac.
	   Judge Patrick Desmure is investigating a system under which
workers on the city hall payroll were actually working for the
conservative Rally for the Republic party (RPR), which Chirac
founded and Juppe served as secretary general.
	   Juppe responded Tuesday evening that the city of Paris ``did not
pay RPR employees.'' But he also told TF-1 television that because
a lack of political financing laws until recently, all parties had
supporters working for government, unions and other associations.
	   Juppe argued the case was not one of ``diverting public funds''
but instead was ``a problem in the functioning and financing of
political parties.''

	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ A jammed courtroom listened in
hushed silence Tuesday as 16 civilians, including five journalists,
were condemned to death by hanging for collaborating with Sierra
Leone's ousted military regime.
	   High Court judge Edmond Cowan allowed the defendants 21 days to
appeal the sentences, which he handed down after lawyers for the
condemned made last-ditch appeals for leniency.
	   ``You will be taken from here to a place of maximum security to
be hanged by the neck until you die. May your soul rest in peace,''
Cowan said to each of the prisoners.
	   Friends and family members of the convicts did not respond as
the sentences were being read, but openly wept as the convicts were
led from the heavily-guarded High Court in Sierra Leone's capital
of Freetown.
	   One of the convicts, a former newspaper editor Ibrahim Ben
Kargbo, told the courtroom he had been prepared for the execution
order, although he believed it was unfair.
	   ``We know that we are going to die. But this is a pointer to all
decent citizens that they too could be here (sentenced to death)
one day,'' Kargbo said.
	   The 16 were taken by police and West African intervention force
soldiers to Freetown's maximum security prison.
	   The ruling came just a day after a 12-member jury found the 16
guilty of helping the country's former military junta take power in
an armed coup d'etat last May.
	   The junta troops led by Lt. Col. Johnny Paul Koroma were
unseated in February by Nigerian-led West African troops, paving
the way for a return to power by President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah's
elected government.
	   Along with Kargbo, the convicted journalists are former British
Broadcasting Corporation announcer Hilton Fyle, Sierra Leone state
radio executive Gipu Felix George and radio journalists Dennis
Smith and Olivia Mensah.
	   Former junta spokesman Alieu Kamara was also among those
convicted. The others include Sierra Leonean businessmen and
government bureaucrats. Two people were found not guilty and have
been freed from custody.
	   The convictions are the first under Kabbah's restored
government, which has pursued treason cases against at least 40
other civilians. Another 38 soldiers are being court martialled.
	   One of the country's foremost warlords, former rebel leader
Foday Sankoh, also faces charges for crimes against humanity.
	   Junta and allied rebel forces continue to kill, rape and maim
villagers as part of their campaign against the government and have
threatened mass killings in retaliation against the jailing of
Sankoh and other rebels.
	   A Sierra Leonean human rights activist said Tuesday he was
disappointed with the death sentences.
	   ``People will start fighting to justify the death sentence,''
Suleiman Banja-Tejan-Fie said. ``But it cannot be done.''

	   WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. (AP) _ Sean Sargent hit two home runs,
including a three-run shot to cap a five-run seventh inning, as
Langley, Canada, beat Kashima, Japan, 10-5 Tuesday in the Little
League Baseball World Series.
	   Langley went into the sixth inning trailing 5-1 before scoring
four runs in the sixth and five more in the seventh on four of its
five home runs in the game.
	   The Canadians have hit eight homers in the series.
	   With Monday's 4-3 victory over Guadalupe, Mexico, Langley is
2-0. Kashima is 2-1 and Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, 0-1.
	   Langley's victory eliminated the defending champions from
Guadalupe _ 0-2 before Tuesday's game _ from contention the
international pool championship on Thursday.
	   Mike Erickson led off the sixth with a solo home run, his third
of the series, and Jeff Duda followed two walks with a three-run
shot to tie it at 5-5. Langley starter Jordan Lennerton followed
Sargent's seventh-inning shot with a two-run homer of his own.
	   Kashima starter Takeshi Kato gave up one run _ Sargent's first
homer _ on four hits over five innings before manager Atsushi
Ohkawa pulled him before the final inning and the trouble started.
	   Tetsuya Furukawa continued his hot World Series hitting for
Kashima, going 2-for-4 with a grand slam, a double and five RBIs.
He had a triple and RBI double in his first game and a homer in the
second.
	   In later games Tuesday, the U.S. South champion faced the U.S.
East; Dhahran played Mexico; and the U.S. West played the U.S.
Central champion.
	   The winners of the U.S. and international pool championships
advance to Saturday's final.

Russia's economic woes delay IMF loan to Ukraine
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Russia-Economy &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _The International Monetary Fund said Tuesday it
may need more time to assess the effect of Russia's intensifying
financial crisis and political change on neighboring Ukraine before
it can set a date to approve a dlrs 2.2 billion loan to Ukraine.
	   ``With recent developments in Russia, we are reviewing the
situation in Ukraine,'' an IMF spokeswoman said. ``As soon as the
reassessment is completed we will set a board date.''
	   The fund's executive board was expected to meet before the end
of August to approve the loan, whose first installment is expected
to total dlrs 200 to dlrs 250 million. The money is considered
crucial for the chronically cash-short country with dlrs 18 billion
in foreign debt.
	   Ukraine, once part of the former Soviet Union, maintains close
economic links with the successor government in Russia.
	   Ukraine's currency, the hryvna, has been under pressure in
recent months because foreign investors have been pulling out of
the country's financial markets. The National Bank in Kiev has
spent some 15 percent of its reserves defending the country's
currency, leaving about dlrs 1.75 billion in its treasury.
	   Ukrainian officials have said the IMF loan would be used
primarily to replenish the National Bank's reserves
	   Until the Russian government devalued the ruble last week and
Russian President Boris Yeltsin replaced his prime minister Sunday,
unleashing further turmoil in the already disturbed Russian
financial markets, prospects for the IMF loan to Ukraine had looked
good.
	   A team of IMF officials had reached agreement with Ukrainian
authorities on a reform program earlier this month. And Ukrainian
President Leonid Kuchma, who approved reducing government
expenditure by 30 percent until the end of the year, said Sunday he
expected the board would approve the loan this week.

 &UR; EDS: CORRECTS title of Guinness book in graf 4

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A British man says he plans to spend six months
buried in his local pub's garden as a tribute to his dead mother.
	   Geoff Smith, 37, is scheduled to descend Saturday into a
coffin-shaped box buried near the Railway Inn pub in Mansfield,
north England. He says he hopes to stay in the coffin for 180 days
_ long enough to beat the world record-holder.
	   In 1968, Smith's mother, Emma, spent 101 days underground in
Skegness and set a world record that stood until 1981, when an
American was buried alive for 141 days.
	   Now, Smith wants to reclaim the record for his family _ even
though The Guinness Book of Records no longer recognizes the stunt
due to safety concerns.
	   Smith, whose mother died in 1996, plans to attempt the stunt in
a seven-foot-long (2.1-meter-long) box, which has a TV, lighting
and toilet facilities. Food and drink will be passed down to him
through a small tube.
	   ``My mother did it so she could be in The Guinness Book of
Records. I am doing it as a tribute to her,'' said Smith, who has
three children. ``I have been psyching myself up for two years and
now I am ready to go.''
	   Smith, who is unemployed, plans to emerge from the box in
February.

were condemned to death by hanging for collaborating with Sierra
Leone's ousted military regime.
	   High Court judge Edmond Cowan allowed the defendants 21 days to
appeal the sentences, which he handed down after lawyers for the
condemned made last-ditch appeals for leniency.
	   ``You will be taken from here to a place of maximum security to
be hanged by the neck until you die. May your soul rest in peace,''
Cowan said to each of the prisoners.
	   Friends and family members of the convicts did not respond as
the sentences were being read, but openly wept as the convicts were
led from the heavily-guarded High Court in Sierra Leone's capital
of Freetown.
	   One of the convicts, a former newspaper editor Ibrahim Ben
Kargbo, told the courtroom he had been prepared for the execution
order, although he believed it was unfair.
	   ``We know that we are going to die. But this is a pointer to all
decent citizens that they too could be here (sentenced to death)
one day,'' Kargbo said.
	   The 16 were taken by police and West African intervention force
soldiers to Freetown's maximum security prison.
	   The ruling came just a day after a 12-member jury found the 16
guilty of helping the country's former military junta take power in
an armed coup d'etat last May.
	   The junta troops led by Lt. Col. Johnny Paul Koroma were
unseated in February by Nigerian-led West African troops, paving
the way for a return to power by President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah's
elected government.
	   Along with Kargbo, the convicted journalists are former British
Broadcasting Corporation announcer Hilton Fyle, Sierra Leone state
radio executive Gipu Felix George and radio journalists Dennis
Smith and Olivia Mensah, who recently gave birth in prison to a
baby boy.

	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ A bomb exploded inside a crowded
Planet Hollywood restaurant on Tuesday, killing one person and
injuring more than a dozen, police said.
	   Police Senior Superintendent John Sterrenberg said the device
exploded at 7:20 p.m. inside the restaurant as it was packed with
diners, and confirmed a female had died and 24 people were injured.
Nationalities and other details on the victims were unknown.
	   No suspects in the attack were immediately named. Cape Town has
been hit by violence involving gangs from impoverished townships
around the city and also involving a group puportedly trying to
stop the gangsters. The group, People Against Drugs and
Gangsterism, is suspected of being behind bomb attacks against
suspected drug dealers.
	   Police cordoned off the restaurant in the trendy Victoria and
Albert Waterfront and were reinforced with armored cars. Ambulances
with sirens wailing went to the scene and soon a crowd of onlookers
and journalists gathered.
	   ``It's a shame,'' said onlooker Patty McGoughran, of Washington
D.C., who was on business in South Africa installing computers.
``It's such a beautiful place, and this is apalling. We are scared
after things like Nairobi. But we thought we were safe here.''
	   The attack bore no similarities to the bombings of the American
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 257 people on Aug. 7.

Barcelona adds firepower in attempt to topple Vasco
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GUAYAQUIL, Ecuador (AP) _ Not wanting to see its second chance
in eight years at South America's club championship go down the
tubes, Barcelona is trying everything it has _ and some it didn't
until recently.
	   The Guayaquil club added forward Agustin Delgado from Mexico's
Cruz Azul club, who will line up on the front line with Colombian
Anthony de Avila and Ecuadorean Nicolas Asencio, now fully
recovered from a leg injury.
	   ``We are going to play offensively, since this is how we need to
play to win the title,'' Barcelona coach Dario Insua said.
	   Already trailing 2-0 from the first leg two weeks ago in Rio de
Janeiro, Barcelona needs a rout of Vasco da Gama to avoid repeating
its loss in the 1990 final to Olimpia of Paraguay 2-0 and 1-1.
	   Neither team has ever won the title.
	   Vasco arrived in Guayaquil Monday night, but, except for their
coach, did not speak to reporters.
	   ``Vasco will attack with its full force on offense and when it
has to defend, it will do it the same way, with its full force,''
Vasco coach Antonio Lopez said.
	   Barcelona's former team president Isidro Romero announced that
he will reward the player who scores the goal that gives his former
team the South American championship dlrs 40,000.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; Possible Lineups &QC; 
	   BARCELONA: Francisco Cevallos, Luis Gomez, Raul Noriega, Holger
Quinonez, Fricson George, Julio Rosero, Hector Carabali, Marcelo
Morales, Anthony De Avila, Nicolas Asencio and Agustin Delgado.
	   VASCO DE GAMA: Carlos Germano, Wagner, Odvan, Mauro Galvao,
Felipe, Luizinho, Nasa, Juninho, Pedrinho, Donizete and Luizao.
	   Referee: Javier Castrilli, Argentina.

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Leaders of Europe's major domestic soccer leagues
on Tuesday rejected rival plans for a breakaway super league.
	   UEFA's Committee for Professional Football said it opposed the
project by Media Partners, a Milan-based company, for the formation
of a new league composed of Europe's most elite clubs.
	   Italy's Antonio Matarrese, the committee chairman and also a
UEFA vice president, said: ``This committee rejects this private
project. The committee does not feel it deserves our attention.''
	   Approval will be sought at a meeting of UEFA's executive
committee in Monaco on Saturday for the creation of a task force,
composed of Matarrese and other top officials, to draw up a radical
strategy to head off the threat of a breakaway league. UEFA hopes
to adopt the strategy by the end of this year.
	   UEFA general secretary Gerhard Aigner confirmed Tuesday that a
plan to merge the UEFA Cup and Cup Winners Cup would be among the
proposals.
	   Aigner also confirmed that in the 1999/2000 season, the
Champions League would have four qualifying groups of six teams
instead of the present six groups of four teams.
	   UEFA Media Director Fritz Ahlstrom said having two competitions
instead of three is designed to give clubs, particularly the major
clubs, more European matches. ``We are ready to remodel the club
competitions so that the big clubs can get some more matches in
Europe. More matches means more income,'' he said.
	   But Ahlstrom said UEFA remained mindful of the need to make sure
smaller national associations and their clubs also benefited from
the proposals.
	   ``It is a question of finding a balance, to meet the demands of
the major clubs to play more matches, but at the same time to serve
all the small clubs and the basis of European football, the grass
roots.''
	   Aigner said the proposals would respect ``sporting principles''
before commercial considerations.
	   The meeting was also attended by the heads of European leagues,
including Peter Leaver of England's Premier League and Franco
Carraro of Italy's Serie A. Also attending were leaders of the
leagues in Portugal, Netherlands, France, Germany, Belgiam, Austria
and Spain.
	   Matarrese said there were ``moments of antagonism'' among
members but by the end of the meeting all were in agreement in
opposing the super league plan.
	   The meeting came one day after Media Partners discussed the
proposals with leading European clubs in London.
	   Media Partners hopes to form a Super League by 2001 involving
the biggest names in European soccer, including Bayern Munich,
Ajax, Inter and AC Milan, Manchester United and Arsenal.

Saudi King Fahd discharged from hospital

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Saudi King Fahd was discharged from
hospital Tuesday after undergoing medical check-ups, the official
Saudi press agency reported.
	   King Fahd, who is in his mid-70s, was admitted to King Faisal
Specialist Hospital on Sunday.
	   It was the fourth time this year that the Saudi monarch has been
admitted to the hospital.
	   On Aug. 12, the king underwent gall bladder surgery.
	   Fahd went to the same hospital on Aug. 2. He was also
hospitalized briefly in March and April.
	   Fahd's health has been the source of much speculation since he
suffered a stroke in 1995 that damaged his short-term memory and
his ability to concentrate.
	   Two months later, he temporarily handed over power to his
half-brother, Crown Prince Abdullah.
	   Fahd has suffered from diabetes and arthritis for years. Since
his stroke he has used a wheelchair.
	   He was born in 1924 but the exact date is not known.

Draft: Libya sanctions suspended once suspects appear for trial

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council would agree to
suspend U.N. sanctions against Libya as soon as two Libyan suspects
in the 1988 Pan Am bombing arrive in the Netherlands for trial,
according to a draft resolution Tuesday.
	   The council would consider additional sanctions if Libya doesn't
promptly turn over the two suspects, Abdel Basset al-Megrahi and
Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, the U.S.-British sponsored draft said.
	   Current sanctions against Libya include an air embargo and curbs
on arms sales and on certain financial and travel activities. U.S.
lawmakers have in the past urged an international oil embargo on
Libya, an OPEC member.
	   The draft circulated as the council began preliminary
consultations Tuesday on a deal to try the two Pan Am flight
suspects in the Netherlands using Scottish judges and Scottish law.

 &UR; Guerrillas fire rockets at Israel after Israelis kill commander
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with guerrilla rockets fired toward Israel &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Guerrillas fired rockets on northern Israel
Tuesday in retaliation for an Israeli helicopter attack that killed
a guerrilla commander in southern Lebanon, Lebanese security
officials said.
	   The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a total
of about 20 rockets were launched in two barrages at 9:45 p.m.
(1845GMT) across the Israeli-occupied zone in southern Lebanon and
toward northern Israel's Galilee.
	   Israel's army radio reported injuries and damage in Kiryat
Shemona after a barrage of Katyusha rockets landed inside the
northern Israeli border town. The Israeli army said it was checking
the report.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack,
which is certain to escalate tension along the Lebanese-Israeli
border and invite Israeli retaliation.
	   Rocket attacks on northern Israel were halted as part of a
U.S.-brokered understanding in 1996 that ended an Israeli bombing
blitz on Lebanon. The understanding has been largely respected.
	   The rocket attack Tuesday night marked a major escalation in
hostilities in the south. It came after Israeli helicopters hunted
down and killed a guerrilla commander and warplanes blasted
suspected militant hideouts.

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ A bomb exploded inside a crowded
Planet Hollywood restaurant on Tuesday, killing one person and
injuring more than a dozen, police said.
	   Police Senior Superintendent John Sterrenberg said the device
exploded at 7:20 p.m. inside the restaurant as it was packed with
diners, and confirmed a female had died and 24 people were injured.
Nationalities and other details on the victims were unknown.
	   A witness who had been at the ground-floor bar in the two-story
restaurant described a horrific scene.
	   ``I saw people without limbs,'' Bertie Liebenberg, who was
visiting from Johannesburg, told the South African Press
Association. ``Decor on the ceiling came crashing down, and crashed
onto people, tables and chairs.''
	   No suspects in the attack were immediately named. Cape Town has
been hit by violence involving gangs from impoverished townships
around the city and also involving a group purportedly trying to
stop the gangsters. The group, People Against Drugs and
Gangsterism, is suspected of being behind bomb attacks against
suspected drug dealers.
	   Police cordoned off the restaurant in the trendy Victoria and
Albert Waterfront and were reinforced with armored cars. Ambulances
with sirens wailing went to the scene and soon a crowd of onlookers
and journalists gathered.
	   ``It's a shame,'' said onlooker Patty McGoughran, of Washington
D.C., who was on business in South Africa installing computers.
``It's such a beautiful place, and this is apalling. We are scared
after things like Nairobi. But we thought we were safe here.''
	   The attack bore no similarities to the bombings of the American
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 257 people on Aug. 7.

Katyusha rockets land in Israel, after guerrilla killed

<TEXT>
	   KIRYAT SHEMONA, Israel (AP) _ A large barrage of Katyusha
rockets landed inside the northern Israeli town of Kiryat Shemona
late Tuesday, and Israel's Army radio reported there were injuries
and damage.
	   The barrage fell only hours after an Israeli helicopter gunship
fired a rocket killing a senior figure in the Shiite Muslim
guerrilla group Amal in south Lebanon, flaring tensions across the
shared border.
	   Israel radio said a separate barrage fell on Israel's Western
Galilee area. The Israeli army said it was checking the report.
	   Raanan Aloni, a resident of Kiryat Shemona, said that a first
set of rockets hit the center of the 14,000 resident town at
approximately 9:45pm (18:45gmt). One rocket crashed into the house
next door but no one was home, he said. ``Other neighbors ran to
shelters,'' Aloni told Israel radio.
	   Samir Sulidan, a resident of another northern community told
Army radio that rockets landed in his settlement as well. Sulidan
said there was damage but no injuries and that people had been
taken by surprise.
	   ``People are in panic, in panic and fear. There are the wails of
women and children - don't even ask about it,'' he said.
	   The Israeli army usually warns civilians when there is a high
probability of incoming rockets, ushering them into public
shelters, but Sulidan said there was no such warning prior to the
strike.
	   Earlier Tuesday, Israeli helicopters killed Hossam al-Amin,
reportedly the second-in-command of the military faction of Shiite
Amal, as he was driving along the south Lebanese coastal road not
far from the Israeli border.
	   The Israeli army said the hit on Amin was a result of his groups
recent attacks on Israeli soldier positions in a self-style
security zone Israeli patrols to prevent guerrillas from
cross-border attacks.
	   Israeli warplanes also attacked suspected guerrilla hideouts in
south Lebanon, reportedly injuring six civilians including a child
and one guerrilla.

EDS: RECASTS with men's 100m
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Greene wins men's 100m, Jones wins women's, still unbeaten &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Undisturbed by a 20-day haitus,
world champion Maurice Greene of the United States returned to
Europe to win a tough men's 100m field Tuesday at the Athletissima
Grand Prix meet.
	   In the women's 100m, world champion Marion Jones of the United
States extended her winning streak bolting to victory and a 15th
victory in the event this year.
	   With a top-drawer field gathered at one of the fastest tracks in
the world, it was widely believed that Donovan Bailey's world
record of 9.84 was in jeopardy.
	   However, as the night air cooled and the jittery 100m field
triggered two false starts, Bailey's record remained safely intact.
	   In fact, crossing in 9.92, Greene was the only sprinter to run
under 10 seconds. His compatriot Jon Drummond, finished second in
10 seconds flat. Obadele Thompson of Barbados placed third, also
crossing in 10.00.
	   Ato Boldon, who has the fastest time in the world this year,
twice running 9.86, finished back in fourth, crossing in 10.10.
	   Frankie Fredericks, who has run 23 sub-10 seconds races _ more
than any other sprinter in history _ finished a surprising sixth,
trialing in 10.14.
	   Greene, who won here last year with an even quicker time of 9.90
in the rain, had arrived at in Lausanne ready to do some damage.
	   ``I was feeling well to come here and run a good time,'' said
Greene, who said the false starts did not bother him. ``I felt very
ready. I had a lot of good practice at home.''
	   Jones, who remains unbeaten in the 100m this season, continued
her reign over the women's field, finishing in 10.72, a solid meter
ahead of her closest rival.
	   Greece's Ekaterina Thanou, second, finished a substantial .30
back, while American Inger Miller finished third in 11.03.
	   Jones, who has run under 11 seconds 13 times this season, was
not far off her bid for a 10.70 chrono. If not for her confusion
concerning the painted white lines at the finish, Jones might just
have attained her goal.
	   ``I messed up with the lines,'' said Jones. ``I thought the
first line was the finish. But I thought it went really well
anyways.
	   ``I also think I could have run faster it it had been a bit
warmer,'' added Jones.
	   Jones' easy finish was also partly due to a comfortable field.
	   Newly crowned European champion Christine Arron of France, who
became the third fastest woman in history last week, was absent. So
was Russia's Irina Privalova, the third fastest woman this year.
	   Fans will have to wait until the Grand Prix meet in Brussels on
Friday for a showdown between Jones and Arron.
	   The win raises Jones' record to 29 victories this year, with one
60m win, 15 in the 100m, five in the 200, one in the 400m and seven
in the long jump.
	   In the men's 800m, world junior champion William Chirchir of
Kenya claimed victory, crossing in 1:45.63. It was only in the
final couple of meters that Chirchir sped past compatriot David
Kiptoo, who finished second .12 back. Arthemon Hatungimana of
Burundi was third in 1:45.91.
	   Nigeria's Glory Alozie won the women's 100m hurdles in 12.56.
Despite crossing in an identical time, Jamaica's Michelle Freeman,
placed second, followed by American Melissa Morrison, third in
12.74.
	   Two-time world champion Trine Hattestad of Norway won the
women's javelin, recording a distance of 67.98 meters. Cuba's Sonia
Bisset was second with 67.59, followed by Russia's Tatjana
Shikolenko, third with 65.78.

UEFA Cup: Wisla Krakow advances after 2-1 win over Trabzonspor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TRABZON, Turkey (AP) _ Wisla Krakow beat Trabzonspor 2-1 Tuesday
and moved into the first round of the UEFA Cup on a comfortable 7-2
aggregate.
	   After a goal-less first half, Wisla's Nigerian midfielder
Ibrahim Sunday opened the scoring in the 54th minute with a
powerful strike from just inside the penalty area that left
Trabzonspor keeper Peter Milosevski helpless.
	   Tomasz Kulawic beat Milosevski with a shot from close range in
the 64th minute to give his team a 2-0 lead.
	   Midfielder Huseyin Cimsiv scored Trabzonspor's only goal with a
header in the 68th minute after receiving a pass from Dilaver
Satilmis.
	   Despite trailing 5-1 from the away leg, Trabzonspor maintained
strong pressure on the Polish team in the first half, but was
unable to have an impact on Wisla's defense.

	   VOLGOGRAD, Russia (AP) _ Red Star of Belgrade defeated Rotor
Volgograd of Russia 2-1 in the second leg of a UEFA Cup second
qualifying round match Tuesday.
	   Red Star dominated in the first half of the match but Rotor's
goalkeeper Andrei Chichkin had an outstanding game and made several
dramatic saves. Both teams missed numerous scoring opportunities.
	   Red Star player Jovan Gojkovic was expelled in the 53rd minute
for tackling from behind, forcing his team to play the rest of the
match with only 10 players.
	   The Russians responded by going on the offensive, and Rotor
striker Alexander Zernov opened scoring in the 59th minute. Red
Star striker Perica Ognjenovic equalized in the 70th minute when
two Red Star players launched a counterattack from their penalty
area and found themselves with an open field and only one Russian
defender in front of the goal.
	   Ivan Dudic faded Rotor's last hope with Red Star's second goal
in the 80th minute, sending his team to the next round of the UEFA
Cup with 4-2 on aggregate.
	   A crowd of 25,000 watched the match.

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to correct slug &QL; 
 &UR; Greene wins men's 100m, Jones wins women's, still unbeaten &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Undisturbed by a 20-day haitus,
world champion Maurice Greene of the United States returned to
Europe to win a tough men's 100m field Tuesday at the Athletissima
Grand Prix meet.
	   In the women's 100m, world champion Marion Jones of the United
States extended her winning streak bolting to victory and a 15th
victory in the event this year.
	   With a top-drawer field gathered at one of the fastest tracks in
the world, it was widely believed that Donovan Bailey's world
record of 9.84 was in jeopardy.
	   However, as the night air cooled and the jittery 100m field
triggered two false starts, Bailey's record remained safely intact.
	   In fact, crossing in 9.92, Greene was the only sprinter to run
under 10 seconds. His compatriot Jon Drummond, finished second in
10 seconds flat. Obadele Thompson of Barbados placed third, also
crossing in 10.00.
	   Ato Boldon, who has the fastest time in the world this year,
twice running 9.86, finished back in fourth, crossing in 10.10.
	   Frankie Fredericks, who has run 23 sub-10 seconds races _ more
than any other sprinter in history _ finished a surprising sixth,
trialing in 10.14.
	   Greene, who won here last year with an even quicker time of 9.90
in the rain, had arrived at in Lausanne ready to do some damage.
	   ``I was feeling well to come here and run a good time,'' said
Greene, who said the false starts did not bother him. ``I felt very
ready. I had a lot of good practice at home.''
	   Jones, who remains unbeaten in the 100m this season, continued
her reign over the women's field, finishing in 10.72, a solid meter
ahead of her closest rival.
	   Greece's Ekaterina Thanou, second, finished a substantial .30
back, while American Inger Miller finished third in 11.03.
	   Jones, who has run under 11 seconds 13 times this season, was
not far off her bid for a 10.70 chrono. If not for her confusion
concerning the painted white lines at the finish, Jones might just
have attained her goal.
	   ``I messed up with the lines,'' said Jones. ``I thought the
first line was the finish. But I thought it went really well
anyways.
	   ``I also think I could have run faster it it had been a bit
warmer,'' added Jones.
	   Jones' easy finish was also partly due to a comfortable field.
	   Newly crowned European champion Christine Arron of France, who
became the third fastest woman in history last week, was absent. So
was Russia's Irina Privalova, the third fastest woman this year.
	   Fans will have to wait until the Grand Prix meet in Brussels on
Friday for a showdown between Jones and Arron.
	   The win raises Jones' record to 29 victories this year, with one
60m win, 15 in the 100m, five in the 200, one in the 400m and seven
in the long jump.
	   In the men's 800m, world junior champion William Chirchir of
Kenya claimed victory, crossing in 1:45.63. It was only in the
final couple of meters that Chirchir sped past compatriot David
Kiptoo, who finished second .12 back. Arthemon Hatungimana of
Burundi was third in 1:45.91.
	   Nigeria's Glory Alozie won the women's 100m hurdles in 12.56.
Despite crossing in an identical time, Jamaica's Michelle Freeman,
placed second, followed by American Melissa Morrison, third in
12.74.
	   Two-time world champion Trine Hattestad of Norway won the
women's javelin, recording a distance of 67.98 meters. Cuba's Sonia
Bisset was second with 67.59, followed by Russia's Tatjana
Shikolenko, third with 65.78.

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Rapid defeated Omnia 2-0, but slipped
into the next round of UEFA Cup play on an away-goal rule, after a
second-round qualifying match Tuesday.
	   Rapid started out fast on the field, but fumbled around for a
while before finding a pattern to break through Omonia's strong
defense. Andreas Heraf headed the ball into the goal at nine
minutes, with the first goal of the night.
	   In the 70th minute, Oliver Freud took a shot from 25 meters
(yards), which bounced off Omonia's Andreas Charitou, before Rene
Wagner shot it into the net.
	   Wagner also scored Rapid's only goal at Nikosia Aug. 11, which
earned his team a spot in the next round under the away-goal rule.
	   After the game, Rapid coach Heribert Weber told the Austria
Press Agency, ``We knew that it would be a tough game, although
nobody believed us that Nikosia has good players. My team played 90
minutes long and gave everything they had, and it all went our
way.''

Grains sink; soybeans higher
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Grain futures prices fell sharply Tuesday on the
Chicago Board of Trade, while soybean futures edged higher.
	   Wheat futures were pressured by news Egypt had canceled a U.S.
wheat purchase, and after Australia revised upward its estimate for
a record crop. That overshadowed Taiwan's purchase of 102,000
metric tons of American wheat.
	   Corn futures slipped after the U.S. Department of Agriculture
reported the nation's corn crop showed slight improvement in the
past week, keeping them on track for the second-largest harvest in
history.
	   Corn has been pressured for weeks, flirting with 10-year lows as
early Midwestern crop tours reveal above-average yields that could
boost the crop above 10 billion bushels.
	   Soybean futures rose after the USDA reported soybeans in
good-to-excellent condition fell 2 percentage points in the past
week, to 65 percent from 67 percent. While the decrease came mainly
from smaller-producing states such as Missouri, some market
participants interpreted the report as possibly reducing the
expected record fall harvest.
	   Soybean prices also rose after a Chinese official estimated 25
percent of the crops in the province that produces 40 percent of
that country's soybean production would perish because of flooding.
That could mean a loss of 1.5 million metric tons of soybeans and
boost U.S. export prospects.
	   A rally in soybean oil cash markets also supported soybean
futures prices.
	   Wheat for December delivery fell 5 cents to dlrs 2.64 1-2 a
bushel; December corn fell 2 cents to dlrs 2.13 1-2 a bushel;
December oats was unchanged at dlrs 1.17 1-2 a bushel; November
soybeans rose 2 1-2 cents to dlrs 5.31 1-4 a bushel.

Katyusha rockets land in Israel, after guerrilla killed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reports of rockets landing on other location
across the Israeli-Lebanese borders, quotes from eye-witness &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIRYAT SHEMONA, Israel (AP) _ A large barrage of Katyusha
rockets landed inside the northern Israeli town of Kiryat Shemona
late Tuesday, and Israel's Army radio reported there were injuries
and damage.
	   The barrage fell only hours after an Israeli helicopter gunship
fired a rocket killing a senior figure in the Shiite Muslim
guerrilla group Amal in south Lebanon, flaring tensions across the
shared border.
	   Israel radio said a separate barrage fell on Israel's Western
Galilee area. The Israeli army said it was checking the report.
	   Raanan Aloni, a resident of Kiryat Shemona, said that a first
set of rockets hit the center of the 14,000 resident town at
approximately 9:45pm (1845 GMT). One rocket crashed into the house
next door but no one was home, he said. ``Other neighbors ran to
shelters,'' Aloni told Israel radio.
	   Samir Sulidan, a resident of another northern community told
Army radio that rockets landed in his settlement as well. Sulidan
said there was damage but no injuries and that people had been
taken by surprise.
	   ``People are in panic, in panic and fear. There are the wails of
women and children - don't even ask about it,'' he said.
	   The Israeli army usually warns civilians when there is a high
probability of incoming rockets, ushering them into public
shelters, but Sulidan said there was no such warning prior to the
strike.
	   Earlier Tuesday, Israeli helicopters killed Hossam al-Amin,
reportedly the second-in-command of the military faction of Shiite
Amal, as he was driving along the south Lebanese coastal road not
far from the Israeli border.
	   The Israeli army said the hit on Amin was a result of his groups
recent attacks on Israeli soldier positions in a self-style
security zone Israeli patrols to prevent guerrillas from
cross-border attacks.
	   Israeli warplanes also attacked suspected guerrilla hideouts in
south Lebanon, reportedly injuring six civilians including a child
and one guerrilla.

UEFA Cup: Fenerbahce beats IFK Goteborg 1-0, advances
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Fenerbahce defeated IFK Goteborg 1-0
Tuesday, advancing to the first round of the UEFA cup on the away
goal rule after a 2-2 aggregate.
	   In front of a fiercely partisan crowd it took Fenerbahce 63
minutes to overturn the 2-1 deficit against Gotenburg in the
second-leg match.
	   The goal came from a solo effort by Elvir Balic, who
wrong-footed the Goteborg defense and ensured an early exit from
the competition for the Swedes. The Bosnian took the ball out to
the right to score in the left corner of the net from a shot just
outside the penalty area.
	   At the beginning of the second half, French refereee Remy Harrel
was forced to stop the match for several minutes to allow smoke _
from a multitude of Turkish supporters' flares _ to clear from the
Goteborg goal mouth before the Turks could take a corner.

you really need, they say, is a full moon and a big toad.
	   The toad is a rock formation, five meters high by five meters
wide (17 feet by 17 feet), overlooking this hamlet of 500 souls in
eastern Spain.
	   And you don't even have to kiss it.
	   As the legend goes, touch the creature three times under a full
moon and great things will happen in every room of the house.
	   Mayor Benito Ros says the story's been around for a long time _
nobody really knows how long _ and was nearly forgotten, except by
old-timers. But now the toad's been dusted off and re-embraced as a
tongue-in-cheek rival to the sexual potency drug Viagra.
	   ``We've been flooded with calls,'' Ros said. ``It's causing
major, major titillation.''
	   Pilgrims must climb about 150 meters (500 feet) up a hillside to
reach the wonder toad, which looks like it's seated. The path
leading up there _ locals call this the Via Crucis _ has been
spruced up because there are so many visitors these days.
	   The toad is supposed to be all-powerful, helping people win the
lottery, say, or pass a civil service exam, or, of course, put zing
back into their love life.
	   For the next full moon on Sept. 6, Mayor Ros says he expects the
site to be packed.
	   Maria Jose Torres, a village pharmacist, says that strangely
enough, the amphibian's most dedicated followers are young people.
``They're really becoming big fans. Older folks have a harder time
believing in it.''

Italy's leaders promise more jobs, investment out of 1999 budget
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Prime Minister Romano Prodi returned from summer
vacation Tuesday to take a first look at Italy's proposed 1999
budget _ opening day of what threatens to be an autumn of battles
over job creation.
	   In the outline presented by Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio
Ciampi, Prodi's government again asks for greater flexibility from
labor, saying the payoff will be increased investment and
employment. With unemployment at about 12 percent, labor leaders
say they are tired of waiting for jobs from Prodi's now 2-year-old
government.
	   Top labor leader Sergio D'Antonio renewed threats of a strike if
the government doesn't go far enough in boosting jobs and in
investing in Italy's depressed south.
	   ``I don't want a government crisis, I want Prodi to do the
things. Otherwise, he will have to quit,'' said D'Antonio, leader
of one of the nation's three major labor federations.
	   The government plans to present the budget to Parliament at the
end of September. Lawmakers return from summer break next month; in
their absence, expectations of clashes over the budget have given
rise to much talk of a ``hot autumn.''
	   Prodi played down the talk Tuesday as he returned to Rome for
the budget preview.
	   ``The autumn will be complex, difficult but not hot,'' he said,
adding the hopeful note: ``In our country, there's the right
climate for determining the conditions for a recovery.''
	   Since taking office, Prodi has aggressively pursued strict
economic policies so Italy could meet the requirements of European
monetary union. By slashing spending, increasing taxes and fighting
tax evasion, Prodi has been able to largely meet the criteria.
	   Despite the improved economic outlook, Italy's chronic
unemployment shows no sign of improving.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A planned meeting between oil officials of
Mexico, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela has been postponed as the three
wait to see the effects of recent crude output cuts, Mexico's
Secretariat of Energy said Tuesday.
	   No new date has been set for the meeting, which had been
scheduled to take place this week in Mexico.
	   Mexico, Venezuela and Saudi Arabia led efforts in March and June
to remove 3.1 million barrels a day from world oil supply in an
effort to push up sagging prices.
	   The meeting between Mexican Energy Secretary Luis Tellez, Saudi
Oil Minister Ali Naimi and Venezuelan Energy Minister Erwin Arrieta
was to study the effects of the cuts.

UEFA Cup: Rapid advances on a 2-0 against Omnia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Rapid defeated Omnia 2-0, but slipped
into the next round of UEFA Cup play on an away-goal rule, after a
second-round qualifying match Tuesday.
	   Rapid started out fast on the field, but fumbled around for a
while before finding a pattern to break through Omonia's strong
defense. Andreas Heraf headed the ball into the goal at nine
minutes, with the first goal of the night.
	   In the 70th minute, Oliver Freud took a shot from 25 meters
(yards), which bounced off Omonia's Andreas Charitou, before Rene
Wagner shot it into the net.
	   Wagner also scored Rapid's only goal at Nikosia Aug. 11, which
earned his team a spot in the next round under the away-goal rule.
	   After the game, Rapid coach Heribert Weber told the Austria
Press Agency, ``We knew that it would be a tough game, although
nobody believed us that Nikosia has good players. My team played 90
minutes long and gave everything they had, and it all went our
way.''

Jones wins 100m, remains unbeaten
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC;

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ World champion Marion Jones of the
United States extended her winning streak on Tuesday, bolting to
victory in the women's 100 meters at the Athletissima Grand Prix.
	   Jones, who remains unbeaten in the 100m this season, continued
her reign over the women's field, finishing in 10.72, a solid meter
ahead of her closest rival.
	   Greece's Ekaterina Thanou, second, finished a substantial .30
back, while American Inger Miller finished third in 11.03.
	   Jones, who has run under 11 seconds 13 times this season, was
not far off her bid for a 10.70 chrono. If not for her confusion
concerning the painted white lines at the finish, Jones might just
have attained her goal.
	   ``I messed up with the lines,'' said Jones. ``I thought the
first line was the finish. But I thought it went really well
anyways.''
	   Jones' easy finish was also partly due to a comfortable field.
	   Newly crowned European champion Christine Arron of France, who
became the third fastest woman in history last week, was absent. So
was Russia's Irina Privalova, the third fastest woman this year.
	   Fans will have to wait until the Grand Prix meet in Brussels on
Friday for a showdown between Jones and Arron.
	   The win raises Jones' record to 29 victories this year, with one
60m win, 15 in the 100m, five in the 200, one in the 400m and seven
in the long jump.
	   In the men's 800m, world junior champion William Chirchir of
Kenya claimed victory, crossing in 1:45.63. It was only in the
final couple of meters that Chirchir sped past compatriot David
Kiptoo, who finished second .12 back. Arthemon Hatungimana of
Burundi was third in 1:45.91.
	   Nigeria's Glory Alozie won the women's 100m hurdles in 12.56.
Despite crossing in an identical time, Jamaica's Michelle Freeman,
placed second, followed by American Melissa Morrison, third in
12.74.
	   Two-time world champion Trine Hattestad of Norway won the
women's javelin, recording a distance of 67.98 meters. Cuba's Sonia
Bisset was second with 67.59, followed by Russia's Tatjana
Shikolenko, third with 65.78.
	   Portugal's Carla Sacramento won the women's mile in 4:23.41.
Kenya's Jackline Maranga was second .59 back, while Switzerland's
Anita Weyermann delighted the home crowd finishing third, also in
4:24.00.

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ In a ceremony with as many political
overtones as romantic, thousands of people from Syria and the Golan
Heights gathered Tuesday to celebrate the weddings of seven Syrian
women to men living in the Israeli-annexed heights.
	   Most of the couples already had been married - in one case for
nearly 2 1/2 years - but until Tuesday they had been unable to
reside together because Israel had refused to grant permission for
the women to move from Syria to the Golan Heights.
	   Israel seized the strategic plateau from Syria in the 1967
Middle East War and the border is heavily fortified. The capture of
the Golan Heights split many families.
	   It was not clear when the Israeli approval was granted.
	   The families of the brides and grooms were joined by more than
2,000 well-wishers. The families held a party before the brides
crossed to the Israeli side of the Golan.
	   The brides were assisted in their crossing by the International
Committee of the Red Cross, which has been instrumental in
arranging contacts between families in the Golan Heights and Syria.
	   The celebration was also a political statement for many of the
participants.
	   Hassan Qassem, the brother of one of the brides, said that the
marriage represents the deep-seated relations ``with our brothers
and sisters in the occupied territories.''
	   ``Through this wedding, we are stressing our affiliation to the
Golan and to Syria,'' he said.

	   MALMO, Sweden (AP) _ Forward Juricka Vucko Tuesday saved the day
for the Croatians as Hajduk Split overpowered Malmo FF 2-1 to
advance to the first round of the UEFA Cup with a 3-2 aggregate.
	   The Croatians, who started with three players on top, took the
lead in the 41st minute. Counterattacking following a Malmo corner
kick, Vucko shot without reach for Malmo goalie Milan Simeunovic in
the 41st minute. Vucko also scored in the 55th minute following a
counterattack. Malmo reduced the score in the 90th minute through
Jorgen Ohlsson.
	   Malmo*s coach Frans Thijssen praised Hajduk Split and admitted
they won rightfully.
	   Defensively the Croatians were doing well although Vucko was
their best player.
	   '' It was wonderful feeling to score twice. It has been rough
going in the league play but now I may have recovered my form,''
Vucko said.

Katyusha rockets land in Israel, after guerrilla killed

<TEXT>
	   KIRYAT SHEMONA, Israel (AP) _ Katyusha rockets slammed into
northern Israeli towns Tuesday night, injuring at least 12 people,
after a top Lebanese guerrilla leader was killed by an Israeli
helicopter that ambushed his car in south Lebanon.
	   Along the northern border, Israeli residents dashed for shelters
after the rockets took them by surprise.
	   ``People are in panic, in panic and fear. There are the wails of
women and children - don't even ask about it,'' Samir Sulidan, a
resident told Israel radio.
	   The barrage fell only hours after an Israeli helicopter gunship
fired a rocket killing guerrilla commander Hossam al-Amin,
reportedly the second-in-command of the military faction of Shiite
Amal, as he was driving along the south Lebanese coastal road not
far from the Israeli border.
	   A spokesman for Amal in Lebanon acknowledged the killing, but
declined to give al-Amin's rank.
	   Guerrilla groups have been waging a long war against Israeli
troops stationed in south Lebanon since 1985 to prevent cross
border attacks on its northern communities.
	   Both sides have suffered heavy casualties in the fighting but
rocket attacks such as Tuesday's strike are rare and have the
potential to escalate the conflict. After a series of rocket
attacks in 1996, Israel waged a 17-day air strike against guerrilla
targets in which over 100 Lebanese civilians were killed.
	   Five hours before the rockets fell, Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai warned both Amal and Hezbollah, a larger and more
active Iranian-backed guerrilla group, not to take retaliatory
action, such as firing Katyusha rockets at Israel.
	   ``I would not advise anyone on the other side to take action in
response. We reserve the right and have legitimate cause to act as
long as we need to against leaders of terrorism and terrorism
itself wherever it is found,'' Mordechai said, speaking to
reporters.
	   The Israeli army said the hit on al-Amin was a result of his
groups recent attacks on Israeli soldier positions in a self-style
security zone Israeli patrols to prevent guerrillas from
cross-border attacks.
	   The Israeli army said in a statement that several rockets
	   An Israeli army confirmed in a statement that several rockets
fell along the northern border, including Israel's Western Galilee
area where Israel radio said electricity was out in dozens of
Kibbutzim as a result of the strike.
	   A spokesman for the Kiryat Shemona area hospital told Israel
radio that 12 people were being treated for light injuries which
included trauma and shock.
	   Raanan Aloni, a resident of Kiryat Shemona, said that a first
set of rockets hit the center of the 14,000 resident town at
approximately 9:45pm (18:45gmt). One rocket crashed into the house
next door but no one was home, he said. ``Other neighbors ran to
shelters,'' Aloni told Israel radio.
	   The Israeli army usually warns civilians when there is a high
probability of incoming rockets, ushering them into public
shelters, but Sulidan said they received no such warning.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with claim of responsibility; additional witness
description, details on ownership of restaurant &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ A bomb exploded inside a crowded
Planet Hollywood restaurant on Tuesday, killing one person and
injuring 24 others, police said.
	   A caller claiming to represent a group called Muslims Against
Global Oppression phoned a local radio station, Cape Talk, and
claimed responsibility for the blast. The police refused to comment
on the call.
	   Little is known about the group. Some people claiming to be
members were among the 40 or so people who protested U.S. policies
on Iraq and Israel during President Bill Clinton's visit to Cape
Town last March.
	   Police Senior Superintendent John Sterrenberg said the device
exploded at 7:20 p.m. inside Planet Hollywood as it was packed with
diners. He confirmed a female had died and 24 people were injured.
Nationalities and other details on the victims were unknown.
	   A witness who had been at the ground-floor bar in the two-story
Hollywood-theme restaurant described a horrific scene.
	   ``I saw people without limbs,'' Bertie Liebenberg, who was
visiting from Johannesburg, told the South African Press
Association. ``Decor on the ceiling came crashing down, and crashed
onto people, tables and chairs.''
	   Roger Sedres, a local photographer, said he heard the explosion
as he drove past the restaurant, then saw the wounded come
streaming out.
	   One woman sat outside the restaurant, her head in her hands,
screaming: ``Oh God, please tell me my legs are still there,''
Sedres said. The woman's legs were intact.
	   Rescue workers brought out another woman who was motionless,
with mangled legs.
	   Police cordoned off the restaurant in the trendy Victoria and
Albert Waterfront and were reinforced with armored cars. Ambulances
with sirens wailing went to the scene and soon a crowd of onlookers
and journalists gathered.
	   ``It's a shame,'' said onlooker Patty McGoughran, of Washington
D.C., who was on business in South Africa installing computers.
``It's such a beautiful place, and this is apalling. We are scared
after things like Nairobi. But we thought we were safe here.''
	   Nico Smuts, spokesman for Leisurenet, franchise holders of
Planet Hollywood, said the Cape Town branch was wholly South
African-owned.
	   With the restaurant chain originating in the United States,
there was speculation the attack might be a sequel to the bombings
of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 257
people on Aug. 7, or an answer to America's retaliatory
cruise-missile attacks on targets in Afghanistan and Sudan.
	   ``If these rumors are true, the attackers had it completely
wrong because except for the name and franchise, the Waterfront
Planet Hollywood is owned by Cape Town businessmen,'' Smuts said.

Rangers advances in UEFA cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SALONICA, Greece (AP) _ Glasgow Rangers played to a scoreless
draw against PAOK Tuesday in a second-leg qualifying game to
advance to the first round of the UEFA cup on a 2-0 aggregate.
	   The Scottish team had won 2-0 the first-leg match at Ibrox two
weeks ago.
	   Jeered by 32,000 supporters, PAOK pressed hard from the start,
but found it difficult to get through a well-organized Rangers
defense system.
	   The Greek team came close to open the score in the 13th minute
when goaltender Lionel Charbonnier dived to save a shot from three
meters (yards) by Peruvian striker Percy Olivares.
	   Charbonnier made another spectacular save to a free kick from
the edge of the box by Costas Frantzeskos in the 31st.
	   The second half saw PAOK launching one attack after the other as
Rangers fell back to preserve the tie.
	   In the 70th, B. Ferguson made a line-save to a blistering shot
by Liberian midfielder Joe Nagbe.
	   The game's major chance was lost in the 82nd, when a shot by
Pandelis Kafes from outside the area hit Charbonnier's crossbar.

Mexico rejects conditions on arms aid, Senate moves to limit pacts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN RICE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Concerned by U.S. attempts to guide Mexican
anti-drug efforts, Mexican officials are again rejecting calls to
let American agents carry arms in Mexico.
	   The Foreign Relations Secretariat on Monday rejected anew U.S.
demands that Drug Enforcement Administration agents in Mexico be
allowed to carry arms.
	   ``The government of Mexico has repeatedly and emphatically
indicated that it will not grant such permission,'' said
secretariat spokesman Oscar Ramirez Suarez in a news release.
	   The statement came in response to a proposal by two Republican
lawmakers, Sen. Mike DeWine of Ohio and Rep. Bill McCollum of
Florida, which offers new helicopters for Mexico if the country
allows U.S. agents to carry weapons here.
	   The proposal is part of their ``Western Hemisphere Drug
Elimination Act of 1998,'' which also urges that all Mexican and
U.S. law enforcement officials working across the border should be
granted diplomatic immunity.
	   The proposal comes at a time of increased Mexican sensitivity to
U.S. drug-fighting efforts here.
	   Mexican lawmakers expressed outrage in May when the U.S.
announced that U.S. agents working secretly in Mexico had been
involved in the arrest of several Mexican bankers on
money-laundering charges.
	   Mexican officials claimed that the operation violated the
country's sovereignty as well as agreements to share information.
The attorney general's office has vowed to try to extradict and
prosecute the U.S. agents.
	   The proposal for diplomatic immunity in the DeWine-McCollum
measure appears to address that problem.
	   On Monday, Sen. Fernando Solana _ a former foreign secretary _
and Luis Felipe Bravo Mena announced they would introduce a measure
demanding greater legislative oversight of anti-narcotics
agreements signed by Mexico's government.
	   Their bill would require government agencies to notify Mexico's
Senate about any new agreements on drug trafficking, money
laundering or national security.
	   Sen. Jorge Calderon complained that the Treasury Secretariat had
never formally informed the Senate about agreements signed with
other countries against money laundering.
	   ``We are going to see to it that Treasury stops functioning as
an independent republic,'' he said.
	   Meanwhile, a federal court here has blocked extradition of a
major drug-traffic suspect wanted by the United States, Oscar
Malherbe, newspapers reported Tuesday.
	   Drug agents claim Malherbe took over leadership of Mexico's Gulf
Cartel following the 1996 arrest of Juan Garcia Abrego. In January,
a Mexican court sentenced Malherbe to two years in prison on
weapons charges.
	   Malherbe is wanted on multiple drug-trafficking charges in the
United States. The new court ruling blocks extradition at least
until all legal cases against him in Mexico are resolved.

Estranged ex-wife of Peru's president blocked in election bid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ President Alberto Fujimori's former wife
Susana Higuchi, has failed in a second bid to run for office _ this
time in Lima's mayoral election.
	   Peru's top electoral body has ruled that 75 percent of the
signatures on her application were invalid, leaving her far short
of the 96,430 signatures needed to enter the race, election
officials said Tuesday.
	   Officials said many of the signature she collected for the Oct
11 municipal elections were rejected because names and electoral
document numbers either did not exist or did not match. In other
cases, many signatures were apparently signed by the same hand,
they said. There were also repetitions of the same names and
numbers.
	   Higuchi, whose 22-year marriage to Fujimori ended in 1996, had
warned that Fujimori would use his influence with election
officials to block her candidacy. She was not available for comment
after the announcement.
	   While still married to Fujimori, Higuchi tried to run against
him in the 1995 presidential election. But the Fujimori-controlled
Congress approved legislation dubbed ``the Susana Law'' that banned
direct family members of the president from running for the post.
	   Outraged, Higuchi went on television, denouncing the president
as a tyrant and his administration as corrupt.
	   Within days Fujimori stripped her of her First Lady status and
in a publicly televised address said she was emotionally unstable.
	   Higuchi has also sued Fujimori for dlrs 1.2 million she claims
she loaned him to finance his 1990 election campaign. Fujimori has
denied that the signature on the loan document is his.
	   The couple have four children. The eldest, Keiko Sofia, 23, acts
as First Lady.
	   Election officials have approved six candidates for the Lima
race, including current Mayor Alberto Andrade and his main rival
Hurtado Miller, who was Fujimori's first Prime Minister after
coming to power in 1990.

	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ In a ceremony with as many political
overtones as romantic, thousands of people from Syria and the Golan
Heights gathered Tuesday to celebrate the weddings of seven Syrian
women to men living in the Israeli-annexed heights.
	   Most of the couples already had been married - in one case for
nearly 2 1/2 years - but until Tuesday they could not live together
because Israel refused to grant permission for the women to move
from Syria to the Golan Heights.
	   Israel seized the strategic plateau from Syria in the 1967
Middle East War and the border is heavily fortified. The capture of
the Golan Heights split many families.
	   It was not clear when the Israeli approval was granted.
	   The families of the brides and grooms were joined by more than
2,000 well-wishers. The families held a party before the brides
crossed to the Israeli side of the Golan.
	   The brides were assisted in their crossing by the International
Committee of the Red Cross, which has been instrumental in
arranging contacts between families in the Golan Heights and Syria.
	   The celebration was also a political statement for many of the
participants.
	   Hassan Qassem, the brother of one of the brides, said that the
marriage represents the deep-seated relations ``with our brothers
and sisters in the occupied territories.''
	   ``Through this wedding, we are stressing our affiliation to the
Golan and to Syria,'' he said.

Katyusha rockets land in Israel, after guerrilla killed

	   KIRYAT SHEMONA, Israel (AP) _ Katyusha rockets slammed into
northern Israeli towns Tuesday night, injuring at least 12 people,
after a top Lebanese guerrilla leader was killed by an Israeli
helicopter while driving in south Lebanon.
	   Along the northern border, surprised Israeli residents dashed
for shelters after the rocket attack.
	   ``People are in panic, in panic and fear. There are the wails of
women and children _ don't even ask about it,'' Samir Sulidan, a
resident told Israel radio.
	   The barrage came hours after an Israeli helicopter gunship fired
a rocket that killed guerrilla commander Hossam al-Amin, reportedly
the second-in-command of the military faction of the Shiite group
Amal. The attack occurred as al-Amin was driving along the south
Lebanese coastal road not far from the Israeli border.
	   An Amal spokesman in Lebanon acknowledged the killing, but
declined to give al-Amin's rank.
	   Guerrilla groups have been trying to oust Israel troops from
south Lebanon since 1985, when Israel carved out a self-declared
``security zone'' to prevent cross-border attacks on its northern
communities.
	   Both sides have suffered heavy casualties, but guerrilla rocket
attacks on Israeli territory are rare and have the potential to
escalate the conflict. After a series of rocket attacks in 1996,
Israel waged a 17-day air strike against guerrilla targets in which
more than 100 Lebanese civilians were killed.
	   Five hours before the rockets fell, Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai warned both Amal and Hezbollah, a larger and more
active Shiite guerrilla group, not to retaliate.
	   ``I would not advise anyone on the other side to take action in
response. We reserve the right and have legitimate cause to act as
long as we need to against leaders of terrorism and terrorism
itself wherever it is found,'' Mordechai said, speaking to
reporters.
	   The Israeli army said the hit on al-Amin was in response to
recent Amal attacks on Israeli soldiers in the Israeli-controlled
zone in south Lebanon.
	   The Israeli army said several rockets fell along the northern
border. Israel radio said electricity had been knocked out at
dozens of communal farms, known as kibbutzim, in the area.
	   A spokesman for the Kiryat Shemona area hospital told Israel
radio that 12 people were being treated for light injuries,
including trauma and shock.
	   Raanan Aloni, a resident of Kiryat Shemona, said that a first
set of rockets hit the center of the town of 14,000 residents at
approximately 9:45pm (18:45gmt). One rocket crashed into the house
next door but no one was home, he said.
	   ``Other neighbors ran to shelters,'' Aloni told Israel radio.
	   The Israeli army usually warns civilians when there is a high
probability of incoming rockets, ushering them into public
shelters, but Sulidan said they received no such warning.
	   Israeli warplanes also attacked suspected guerrilla hideouts in
south Lebanon, reportedly injuring six civilians including a child
and one guerrilla.

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ A bomb exploded inside a crowded
Planet Hollywood restaurant Tuesday, killing one person and
injuring 24. A man claiming responsibility said it was revenge for
U.S. attacks on targets in Sudan and Afghanistan.
	   The caller to the radio station Cape Talk claimed responsibility
on behalf of a group called Muslims Against Global Oppression.
Police refused to comment on the call.
	   Little is known about the group. Some people claiming to be
members were among the 40 or so people who protested U.S. policies
on Iraq and Israel during President Bill Clinton's visit to Cape
Town last March.
	   The device exploded at 7:20 p.m. (1720 GMT) inside Planet
Hollywood, killing a woman and injuring 24 other people, said
police Senior Superintendent John Sterrenberg. Nationalities and
other details were unknown. U.S. consular officials were reportedly
on the scene to see if Americans were among the victims.
	   A witness who had been at the ground-floor bar in the two-story
Hollywood-theme restaurant described a horrific scene.
	   ``I saw people without limbs,'' Bertie Liebenberg, who was
visiting from Johannesburg, told the South African Press
Association. ``Decor on the ceiling came crashing down, and crashed
onto people, tables and chairs.''
	   Roger Sedres, a local photographer, said he heard the explosion
as he drove past the restaurant, then saw the wounded come
streaming out.
	   One woman sat outside the restaurant, her head in her hands,
screaming: ``Oh God, please tell me my legs are still there,''
Sedres said. The woman's legs were intact.
	   Rescue workers brought out another woman who was motionless,
with mangled legs.
	   Police cordoned off the restaurant in the trendy Victoria and
Albert Waterfront and were reinforced with armored cars. Ambulances
with sirens wailing went to the scene and soon a crowd of onlookers
and journalists gathered.
	   ``It's a shame,'' said onlooker Patty McGoughran, of Washington
D.C., who was on business in South Africa installing computers.
``It's such a beautiful place, and this is appalling. We are scared
after things like Nairobi. But we thought we were safe here.''
	   President Nelson Mandela's minister of security, Sydney
Mufamadi, surveyed the damage and pledged to hunt down the bombers.
	   Nico Smuts, spokesman for Leisurenet, franchise holders of
Planet Hollywood, said the Cape Town branch was wholly South
African-owned.
	   With the restaurant chain originating in the United States,
there was speculation the attack might be a sequel to the bombings
of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 257
people on Aug. 7, or an answer to America's retaliatory
cruise-missile attacks on targets in Afghanistan and Sudan.
	   ``If these rumors are true, the attackers had it completely
wrong because except for the name and franchise, the Waterfront
Planet Hollywood is owned by Cape Town businessmen,'' Smuts said.

 &UR; Greene, Jones win both 100m, Johnson wins 400m &QL;

	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ American world champions Maurice
Greene and Marion Jones made victory look easy, each triumphing in
the 100-meter events Tuesday at the Athletissima Grand Prix meet.
	   Double Olympic champion Michael Johnson led an American sweep of
the podium in the 400m, proving he's finally returned to form after
a slow start to the season due to nagging injuries.
	   Greene, who had not raced since his victory at the Stockholm
Grand Prix, appeared undisturbed by the 20-day haitus, comfortably
winning in 9.92.
	   With a top-drawer field gathered at one of the fastest tracks in
the world, it was widely believed that Donovan Bailey's 9.84 world
record was in jeopardy.
	   However, as the night air cooled and the jittery 100m field
induced two false starts, Bailey's record remained safely intact.
	   In fact, Greene was the only sprinter to run under 10 seconds,
his compatriot Jon Drummond finishing runnerup in 10 seconds flat.
Obadele Thompson of Barbados placed third, also crossing in 10.00.
	   Trinidad's Ato Boldon, who has the fastest time in the world
this year, twice running 9.86, finished back in fourth in 10.10.
	   Namibia's Frankie Fredericks, who has run 23 sub-10 seconds
races _ more than any other sprinter in history _ finished a
surprising sixth, trailing in 10.14.
	   Greene, who won here last year with an even quicker time of 9.90
in the rain, had arrived in Lausanne ready to do some damage.
	   ``I was feeling well to come here and run a good time,'' said
Greene, who said the false starts did not bother him. ``I felt very
ready. I had a lot of good practice at home.''
	   In the women's 100m, Jones extended her winning streak, bolting
to victory and a 15th win in the event this year.
	   Jones, who remains unbeaten in the 100m this season, continued
her reign, finishing in 10.72, a good meter ahead of her closest
rival.
	   Greece's Ekaterina Thanou, second, finished a substantial .30
back, while American Inger Miller was third in 11.03.
	   Jones, who has run under 11 seconds 13 times this season, was
not far off her bid for a 10.70 chrono. If not for her confusion
concerning the painted white lines at the finish, Jones might just
have attained her goal.
	   ``I messed up with the lines,'' said Jones. ``I thought the
first line was the finish. But I thought it went really well
anyways.
	   ``I also think I could have run faster if it had been a bit
warmer,'' added Jones.
	   Jones' easy finish was also partly due to a comfortable field.
	   Newly-crowned European champion Christine Arron of France, who
became the third-fastest woman in history last week, was absent. So
was Russia's Irina Privalova, the third fastest woman this year.
	   Fans will have to wait until the Grand Prix meet in Brussels on
Friday for a showdown between Jones and Arron.
	   The win raises Jones' record to 29 victories this year, with one
60m win, 15 in the 100m, five in the 200, one in the 400m and seven
in the long jump.
	   Johnson, who spent the last 10 days in the United States
preparing his European return, clocked 44.28 in the 400m, a solid
.65 ahead of Jerome Young. Danny McCray finished third in 45.09.
	   Though it was speculated he might outdo himself on the
lightening-quick track and finally crack Butch Reynold's
10-year-old record of 43.29, Johnson also suffered from the gusty,
cool conditions _ a sharp contrast from the current weather in his
hometown.
	   ``It's extremely hot in Dallas right now,'' explained Johnson,
who claimed the 200m and 400m titles at the 1995 world
championships in Sweden, and doubled at the Olympics in Atlanta _
shattering the 200m record in the process.
	   Ranked among the greatest track athletes of all time, Johnson
has lost just two 400m races in the last decade, and remains
unbeaten in 57 of 59 400m finals since 1989.
	   This victory, combined with his time of 43.69 in his last race
in Zurich, and 43.96 in Monaco the week before that, has ended talk
that the 30-year-old might be on the downside of his career.
	   ``A month ago everyone was saying I was finished,'' said
Johnson. ``I'm just trying to win races now. I'm actually right now
not as in good shape as I was.''
	   In the men's 800m, world junior champion William Chirchir of
Kenya claimed victory, crossing in 1:45.63. It was only in the
final couple of meters that Chirchir sped past compatriot David
Kiptoo, who finished second .12 back. Arthemon Hatungimana of
Burundi was third in 1:45.91.
	   Three-time world champion Noureddine Morceli of Algeria won the
men's 1,500m in 3:34.98.
	   France's Olympic champion Jean Galfione won the men's pole
vault, soaring 5.90 meters, followed by compatriot Kalid Jachheb,
second with 5.80.
	   European champion Maksim Tarasov of Russia finished fifth,
jumping 5.70.

Canadians dump Japanese 10-5; U.S. East wins
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID KINNEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WILLIAMSPORT, Pennsylvania (AP) _ Todd Frazier went 3-for-4 with
a two-run home run and Casey Gaynor threw a five-hitter Tuesday as
the U.S. East beat U.S. South 5-3 to claim a spot in Thursday's
U.S. championship.
	   Frazier scored three runs and is now 4-for-8 with a grand slam
and seven RBIs in U.S. East's three wins. The North Carolinians are
1-1 in the U.S. pool and stay in contention.
	   In Tuesday's first game, Sean Sargent hit two home runs,
including a three-run shot to cap a five-run seventh inning, as
Langley, Canada, beat Kashima, Japan, 10-5.
	   With Monday's 4-3 win over Guadalupe, Mexico, Langley is 2-0,
while Kashima is 2-1.
	   Langley's win eliminated the defending champions from Guadalupe
_ 0-2 before Tuesday's game _ from the international pool
championship on Thursday.
	   Greenville's Justin Hardee hit a two-run homer and Shelton
Nelson hit an RBI single, but they were the only players to get to
Gaynor.
	   Robert Barnhill, Greenville's starter, gave up eight hits and
five runs, including two on wild pitches in the sixth.
	   Langley went into the sixth inning trailing 5-1 before scoring
four runs in the sixth and five more in the seventh, hitting four
of its five home runs in the game. The Canadians have hit eight
homers in the series.
	   Mike Erickson led off the sixth with a solo home run, his third
of the series, and Jeff Duda followed two walks with a three-run
shot to tie it at 5-5. Langley starter Jordan Lennerton followed
Sargent's seventh-inning shot with a two-run homer of his own.
	   Kashima starter Takeshi Kato gave up one run _ Sargent's first
homer _ on four hits over five innings before manager Atsushi
Ohkawa pulled him before the final inning and the trouble started.
	   Tetsuya Furukawa went 2-for-4 with a grand slam, a double and
five RBIs and is 6-11 with two homers and seven RBIs in three
games.
	   In Tuesday's late game, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia played Guadalupe,
Mexico.
	   The winners of the U.S. and international pool championships
advance to Saturday's final.

Katyusha rockets land in Israel after guerrilla killed

	   KIRYAT SHEMONA, Israel (AP) _ Katyusha rockets slammed into
northern Israeli towns Tuesday night, injuring at least 12 people,
after a top Lebanese guerrilla leader was killed by an Israeli
helicopter that ambushed his car in south Lebanon.
	   Along the northern border, Israeli residents dashed for shelters
after the rockets took them by surprise.
	   ``People are in panic, in panic and fear. There are the wails of
women and children - don't even ask about it,'' Samir Sulidan, a
resident told Israel radio.
	   The barrage fell only hours after an Israeli helicopter gunship
fired a rocket killing guerrilla commander Hossam al-Amin,
reportedly the second-in-command of the military faction of Shiite
Amal, as he was driving along the south Lebanese coastal road not
far from the Israeli border.
	   A spokesman for Amal in Lebanon acknowledged the killing, but
declined to give al-Amin's rank.
	   The second, larger Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla group
issued a statement in Beirut claiming responsibilty for the attack.
	   The statement, carried on guerrilla radio Al-Noor, said the
attack was meant as a ``deterrent to the enemy ... so they
understand that there is no security for civilians in their
settlements as long as our civilians are killed and attacked.'' The
statement made no mention of the dead Amal commander.
	   Guerrilla groups have been waging a long war against Israeli
troops stationed in south Lebanon since 1985 to prevent cross
border attacks on its northern communities.
	   Both sides have suffered heavy casualties in the fighting but
rocket attacks such as Tuesday's strike are rare and have the
potential to escalate the conflict. After a series of rocket
attacks in 1996, Israel waged a 17-day air strike against guerrilla
targets in which over 100 Lebanese civilians were killed.
	   Five hours before the rockets fell Tuesday, Israeli Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai warned both Amal and Hezbollah not to
take retaliatory action, such as firing Katyusha rockets at Israel.
	   ``I would not advise anyone on the other side to take action in
response. We reserve the right and have legitimate cause to act as
long as we need to against leaders of terrorism and terrorism
itself wherever it is found,'' Mordechai said, speaking to
reporters.
	   The Israeli army said al-Amin ``was personally responsible for
the planning and execution of many terrorist acts by Amal against
the Israeli army,'' in Israelis security zone.
	   Six years ago, in February 1992, Israel killed another guerrilla
leader in much the same way. Then, an Israeli helicopter ambushed a
car in south Lebanon and killed Hezbollah leader Sheik Abbas
Musawi, his wife and five-year-old son.
	   One month later, the group retaliated by bombing the Israeli
embassy in Buenos Aires, Argentina, killing 29 people and wounding
dozens.
	   Israel went after Hezbollah again in 1994 with a major air
strike, killing about 50 guerrillas in a base in eastern Lebanon.
Hezbollah issued warnings it would strike in retribution, and one
month later, the Jewish community center in Buenos Aires was bombed
on July 18, killing 95 people.
	   Security officials in Lebanon, who spoke on customary condition
of anonymity, said 63 rockets were launched from Lebanon but it was
unclear how many landed in Israel.
	   The Israeli army confirmed in a statement that ``several
rockets,'' fell along the northern border, including Israel's
Western Galilee area where electricity was out in dozens of
Kibbutzim as a result of the strike.
	   The rockets left large craters in the earth and set off small
brush fires in fields. One parked truck was directly hit and
destroyed. Another rocket smashed into a side of a house but no one
was home.
	   A spokesman for the Kiryat Shemona area hospital told Israel
radio that 12 people were being treated for light injuries which
included trauma and shock.
	   Raanan Aloni, a resident of Kiryat Shemona, said that a first
set of rockets hit the center of the 14,000 resident town at
approximately 9:45pm (18:45gmt). One rocket crashed into the house
next door but no one was home, he said. ``Other neighbors ran to
shelters,'' Aloni told Israel radio.
	   A later army statement condemned the rocket attack, calling it
``a violation of understandings,'' brokered by former U.S.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher after the April 1996 air
strike.
	   Israeli warplanes also attacked suspected guerrilla hideouts in
south Lebanon earlier in the day, reportedly injuring six civilians
including a child and one guerrilla.

Libya expected to approve proposal for Lockerbie trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SALAH NASRAWI &QC;

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libya is studying a U.S.-British proposal to
try two Libyan suspects in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 in
The Netherlands and will announce Wednesday whether it accepts the
deal, Libyan television reported.
	   The head of the Arab League, Esmat Abdel Meguid, said Tuesday he
expects Libya to accept the agreement.
	   ``The American-British proposal is compatible with the previous
Arab suggestions, which Libya has accepted,'' Abdel Meguid said
after meeting with British Ambassador David Blatherwick.
	   The United States and Britain have said they would accept a
trial by a panel of three Scottish judges under Scottish law in The
Hague.
	   The deal also says that the suspects, Abdel Basset al-Megrahi
and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, cannot be extradited from The Netherlands
and that if found guilty, they would serve their sentences in the
United Kingdom.
	   The two men are accused of planting a bomb aboard the flight,
which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people.
	   Libya's government-run television said experts and officials
were meeting to discuss the proposals and ``a detailed statement
about this will be issued ... Wednesday.''
	   Libya had long demanded that if a trial were held it should be
in a neutral country. Washington and London had insisted on a trial
on their territory.
	   At the United Nations, the Security Council began discussing a
draft resolution saying it would agree to suspend U.N. sanctions
against Libya once the suspects were handed over for trial.
	   The 7-year-old U.N. sanctions against Libya include an air
embargo and curbs on arms sales and on certain financial and travel
activities.

	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian security officers pushed
and shoved three Palestinian lawmakers and beat back two
journalists Tuesday at a protest outside the home of a Hamas
fugitive.
	   The protesters were demanding that Palestinian police ease a
round-the-clock surveillance of the home.
	   The security officers beat a cameraman and a photographer, both
on assignment for The Associated Press, when they refused to stop
covering the protest. Officers seized the video camera of Majed
Salah and the still cameras of Nasser Nasser and only later
returned the equipment.
	   Nasser, who was struck on the head with a heavy mobile phone,
was admitted to Haled Hospital in Ramallah. Doctors at the hospital
said he was in good condition but as a precaution were keeping him
for observation over night.
	   The home being watched belongs to Imad Awadallah, a leader of
the Hamas military wing who escaped from a Palestinian jail earlier
this month. Awadallah was being held on charges he killed the chief
Hamas bombmaker in an internal dispute.
	   Khader Shkirat, a Palestinian human right activist, said
security forces were preventing members of the Awadallah family
from leaving their home.
	   Palestinian security chief Jibril Rajoub earlier denied the
charges and told the Voice of Palestine radio that he would
investigate the rough handling of the lawmakers and journalists.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Telefonos de Mexico SA and its long-distance
competitors have reached agreement on a package of regulatory
measures, ending months of arduous negotiations, the Department of
Communications and Transportation said Tuesday.
	   Telmex, as the company is known, agreed to lower local access
fees to 2.7 U.S. cents a minute from the current rate of 5.7 U.S.
cents.
	   The new local access fees take effect Sept. 23 and expire Dec.
31, 2000, the department said.
	   The agreement addresses local access charges, eliminates a
surcharge on incoming international calls, and requires new
competitors to pay Telefonos de Mexico SA for adapting its
equipment, said Gustavo de la Garza, chief executive officer of
Marcatel SA, one of six long-distance companies operating in
Mexico.
	   Telmex and Alestra SA, a joint venture of AT-and-T Corp. and
Mexico's Grupo Financiero Bancomer and Grupo Alfa SA, agreed on the
terms Monday, said an Alestra source who insisted on not being
identified.
	   The other carriers are: Avantel SA, a joint venture of MCI
Communications Corp. and Grupo Financiero Banamex-Accival SA;
Miditel SA and Protel SA.
	   Telmex, a Mexican Stock Exchange benchmark, is the main
beneficiary of the access fees. Long-distance competitors have
complained the charges were among the world's highest.

Draft: Libya sanctions suspended once suspects appear for trial

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council would agree to
suspend U.N. sanctions against Libya as soon as two Libyan suspects
in the 1988 Pan Am bombing arrive in the Netherlands for trial,
according to a draft resolution Tuesday.
	   The council would consider additional sanctions if Libya doesn't
promptly turn over the two suspects, Abdel Basset al-Megrahi and
Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, the U.S.-British sponsored draft said.
	   Current sanctions against Libya include an air embargo and curbs
on arms sales and on certain financial and travel activities. U.S.
lawmakers have in the past urged an international oil embargo on
Libya, an OPEC member.
	   The draft circulated as the council began preliminary
consultations Tuesday on a deal to try the two Pan Am flight
suspects in the Netherlands using Scottish judges and Scottish law.
	   U.S. and British officials announced their proposal Monday in a
bid to end a 10-year impasse over the Pan Am bombing, which killed
259 people aboard Pan Am Flight 103 and 11 people on the ground at
Lockerbie, Scotland.
	   Libya has refused to turn two suspects over, fearing they would
not get a fair trial in the United States or Scotland.
	   Deputy U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh said he hoped the council
would take action on the resolution in ``the next day or two.''
	   ``So we are expecting that Libya will agree with this process
and very promptly produce the two accused after the council adopts
the resolution,'' Burleigh said.
	   Council president Danilo Turk of Slovenia said ``a very large
number of members'' of the 15-member council also wished quick
action on the resolution.
	   U.N. resolutions also stipulate that sanctions will only be
suspended once Libya cooperates in the French investigation into
the bombing of UTA flight 772, which exploded over the Niger desert
on Sept. 19, 1989, killing all of 170 the passengers and crew.
	   Tuesday's draft reiterates Libya must satisfy that inquiry
before sanctions are suspended. In January, France's top terrorism
judge named six suspects _ including Libyan leader Moammar
Ghadafi's brother-in-law _ in the explosion and asked that a
special terrorism court try the six in absentia.

that ``satisfied most of the French demands.''

council would welcome the U.S.-British proposal and demand that the
Libyan government ensures the two suspects appear for trial in the
Netherlands along with any witnesses or evidence.

stipulate that the trial take place in the United States or the
United Kingdom.
	   Libya has made no formal comment on the proposal.
	   On Tuesday, the head of the Arab League, Esmat Abdel Meguid,
said Libya would probably accept the deal because it was
``compatible with previous suggestions, which Libya has accepted.''

from The Netherlands and that if convicted, they would serve their
sentences in the United Kingdom.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libya is studying a U.S.-British proposal to
try two Libyan suspects in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 in
The Netherlands and will announce Wednesday whether it accepts the
deal, Libyan television reported.
	   The head of the Arab League, Esmat Abdel Meguid, said Tuesday he
expects Libya to accept the agreement.
	   ``The American-British proposal is compatible with the previous
Arab suggestions, which Libya has accepted,'' Abdel Meguid said
after meeting with British Ambassador David Blatherwick.
	   The United States and Britain have said they would accept a
trial by a panel of three Scottish judges under Scottish law in The
Hague.
	   The deal also says that the suspects, Abdel Basset al-Megrahi
and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, cannot be extradited from The Netherlands
and that if found guilty, they would serve their sentences in the
United Kingdom.
	   The two men are accused of planting a bomb aboard the flight,
which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people.
	   Libya's government-run television said experts and officials
were meeting to discuss the proposals and ``a detailed statement
about this will be issued ... Wednesday.''
	   Libya had long demanded that if a trial were held it should be
in a neutral country. Washington and London had insisted on a trial
on their territory.
	   At the United Nations, the Security Council began discussing a
draft resolution saying it would agree to suspend U.N. sanctions
against Libya once the suspects were handed over for trial.
	   The 7-year-old U.N. sanctions against Libya include an air
embargo and curbs on arms sales and on certain financial and travel
activities.

Vucko double sees Split through to UEFA Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Juricka Vucko saved the day for Hajduk Split as
the Croats overpowered Malmo 2-1 in Sweden Tuesday to advance to
the first round of the UEFA Cup with a 3-2 aggregate.
	   Split, held to a surprising 1-1 tie in the first leg of the
second-round qualifier, took the lead in the 41st minute and
doubled the advantage in the 55th minute when Vucko slammed in his
second goal.
	   Malmo scored a consolation goal on fulltime to reduce the
winning margin to 2-1.
	   ''It was wonderful feeling to score twice. It has been rough
going in the league play but now I may have recovered my form,''
Vucko said after the game.
	   Red Star of Belgrade came from behind to beat Russia's Rotor
Volgograd 2-1 in the return match at Volgograd and advance on a 4-2
aggregate.
	   Red Star dominated in the first half but Rotor's goalkeeper
Andrei Chichkin made several dramatic saves to keep the visitors
scoreless.
	   The Yugoslavs maintained the ascendency despite playing with one
man down for almost 40 minutes after Jovan Gojkovic was red-carded
for an illegal tackle.
	   Rotor scored first, through stiker Alexander Zernov in the 59th
minute, but Red Star hit back with goals in the 70th and 80th
minutes to seal the result.
	   Rapid Vienna beat Omonia 2-0 and relied on the away goal rule to
advance to the UEFA Cup. Vienna lost 3-1 in the first leg of the
qualifier in Cyprus and scraped through by keeping Omonia scoreless
at home.
	   Rene Wagner, Rapid's sole scorer at Nikosia two weeks ago,
scored the clincher in the 70th minute after swooping on a rebound
off the post.
	   Anderlecht also qualified on away goals after a 2-0 win over
Osijek of Zagreb. Anderlecht lost 3-1 in Zagreb in the first leg
but held the Croats scoreless Tuesday to advance despite a 3-3
aggregate.
	   Anderlecht scored the decisive goal in 85th minute.
	   Inter Bratislava dominated former Czechoslovakia league rivals
Slavia Prague 2-0 in their return match but still failed to
qualify.
	   Inter scored two second-half goals but couldn't peg back the 4-0
advantage Slavia held after the first-leg match in Prague.
	   Two second-leg matches were played in Turkey, with Trabzonspor
bowing out after a 2-1 loss to Poland's Wisla Krakow and Fenerbahce
beating Sweden's IFK Goteborg 1-0 in Istanbul.
	   Wisla had a 5-1 advantage going into the match and stamped out
any threat of losing by scoring the first goal through Nigerian
midfielder Ibrahim Sunday in the 54th minute.
	   Wisla added another goal in the 64th minute before Trabzonspor
midfielder Huseyin Cimsiv scored for the home side with a header in
the 68th minute.
	   Fenerbahce advanced on the away-goal rule after a 2-2 aggregate
against Goteborg.
	   In front of a fiercely partisan crowd it took Fenerbahce 63
minutes to overturn the 2-1 deficit against the Swedes, Elvir Balic
wrong-footing the Goteborg defense in a solo effort to edge the
visitors out.
	   Two Scottish teams were involved in qualifiers Tuesday.
	   Glasgow Rangers advanced with a 2-0 aggregate after a scoreless
draw against PAOK Salonica in Greece, while Kilmarnock lost to
Sigma Olomouc at home to exit the competition.
	   Rangers, which scored a 2-0 first-leg win at Ibrox two weeks
ago, succeeded where English Premier League titlist Arsenal failed
last year.
	   Cheered on by 32,000 supporters, PAOK pressed hard from the
start but found it difficult to get through a well-organized
Rangers defense.

Draft: Libya sanctions suspended once suspects appear for trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in 3rd-to-last graf with Libya studying proposal &QL; 
 &UR; By SAU CHAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council would agree to
suspend U.N. sanctions against Libya as soon as two Libyan suspects
in the 1988 Pan Am bombing arrive in the Netherlands for trial,
according to a draft resolution Tuesday.
	   The council would consider additional sanctions if Libya doesn't
promptly turn over the two suspects, Abdel Basset al-Megrahi and
Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, the U.S.-British sponsored draft said.
	   Current sanctions against Libya include an air embargo and curbs
on arms sales and on certain financial and travel activities. U.S.
lawmakers have in the past urged an international oil embargo on
Libya, an OPEC member.
	   The draft circulated as the council began preliminary
consultations Tuesday on a deal to try the two Pan Am flight
suspects in the Netherlands using Scottish judges and Scottish law.
	   U.S. and British officials announced their proposal Monday in a
bid to end a 10-year impasse over the Pan Am bombing, which killed
259 people aboard Pan Am Flight 103 and 11 people on the ground at
Lockerbie, Scotland.
	   Libya has refused to turn two suspects over, fearing they would
not get a fair trial in the United States or Scotland.
	   Deputy U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh said he hoped the council
would take action on the resolution in ``the next day or two.''
	   ``So we are expecting that Libya will agree with this process
and very promptly produce the two accused after the council adopts
the resolution,'' Burleigh said.
	   Council president Danilo Turk of Slovenia said ``a very large
number of members'' of the 15-member council also wished quick
action on the resolution.
	   U.N. resolutions also stipulate that sanctions will only be
suspended once Libya cooperates in the French investigation into
the bombing of UTA flight 772, which exploded over the Niger desert
on Sept. 19, 1989, killing all of 170 the passengers and crew.
	   Tuesday's draft reiterates Libya must satisfy that inquiry

Ghadafi's brother-in-law _ in the explosion and asked that a
special terrorism court try the six in absentia.

Katyusha rockets land in Israel after guerrilla killed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Hezbollah statement claiming

Background on previous attacks; Lebanese security officials say 63
rockets launched, EDITS to tighten &QL;

<TEXT>
	   KIRYAT SHEMONA, Israel (AP) _ Katyusha rockets slammed into
northern Israeli towns Tuesday night, injuring at least 12 people,
after a top Lebanese guerrilla leader was killed by an Israeli
helicopter that ambushed his car in south Lebanon.
	   Along the northern border, Israeli residents dashed for shelters
after the rockets took them by surprise.
	   ``People are in panic, in panic and fear. There are the wails of
women and children - don't even ask about it,'' Samir Sulidan, a
resident told Israel radio.
	   The barrage fell only hours after an Israeli helicopter gunship
fired a rocket killing guerrilla commander Hossam al-Amin,
reportedly the second-in-command of the military faction of Shiite
Amal, as he was driving along the south Lebanese coastal road not
far from the Israeli border.
	   A spokesman for Amal in Lebanon acknowledged the killing, but
declined to give al-Amin's rank.
	   The second, larger Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla group
issued a statement in Beirut claiming responsibilty for the attack.
	   The statement, carried on guerrilla radio Al-Noor, said the
attack was meant as a ``deterrent to the enemy ... so they
understand that there is no security for civilians in their
settlements as long as our civilians are killed and attacked.'' The
statement made no mention of the dead Amal commander.
	   Guerrilla groups have been waging a long war against Israeli
troops stationed in south Lebanon since 1985 to prevent cross
border attacks on its northern communities.
	   Both sides have suffered heavy casualties in the fighting but
rocket attacks such as Tuesday's strike are rare and have the
potential to escalate the conflict. After a series of rocket
attacks in 1996, Israel waged a 17-day air strike against guerrilla
targets in which over 100 Lebanese civilians were killed.
	   Five hours before the rockets fell Tuesday, Israeli Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai warned both Amal and Hezbollah not to
take retaliatory action, such as firing Katyusha rockets at Israel.
	   ``I would not advise anyone on the other side to take action in
response. We reserve the right and have legitimate cause to act as
long as we need to against leaders of terrorism and terrorism
itself wherever it is found,'' Mordechai said, speaking to
reporters.
	   The Israeli army said al-Amin ``was personally responsible for
the planning and execution of many terrorist acts by Amal against
the Israeli army,'' in Israelis security zone.
	   Six years ago, in February 1992, Israel killed another guerrilla
leader in much the same way. Then, an Israeli helicopter ambushed a
car in south Lebanon and killed Hezbollah leader Sheik Abbas
Musawi, his wife and five-year-old son.
	   One month later, the group retaliated by bombing the Israeli
embassy in Buenos Aires, Argentina, killing 29 people and wounding
dozens.
	   Israel went after Hezbollah again in 1994 with a major air
strike, killing about 50 guerrillas in a base in eastern Lebanon.
Hezbollah issued warnings it would strike in retribution, and one
month later, the Jewish community center in Buenos Aires was bombed
on July 18, killing 95 people.
	   Security officials in Lebanon, who spoke on customary condition
of anonymity, said 63 rockets were launched from Lebanon but it was
unclear how many landed in Israel.
	   The Israeli army confirmed in a statement that ``several
rockets,'' fell along the northern border, including Israel's
Western Galilee area where electricity was out in dozens of
Kibbutzim as a result of the strike.
	   The rockets left large craters in the earth and set off small
brush fires in fields. One parked truck was directly hit and
destroyed. Another rocket smashed into a side of a house but no one
was home.
	   A spokesman for the Kiryat Shemona area hospital told Israel
radio that 12 people were being treated for light injuries which
included trauma and shock.
	   Raanan Aloni, a resident of Kiryat Shemona, said that a first
set of rockets hit the center of the 14,000 resident town at
approximately 9:45pm (18:45gmt). One rocket crashed into the house
next door but no one was home, he said. ``Other neighbors ran to
shelters,'' Aloni told Israel radio.
	   A later army statement condemned the rocket attack, calling it
``a violation of understandings,'' brokered by former U.S.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher after the April 1996 air
strike.
	   Israeli warplanes also attacked suspected guerrilla hideouts in
south Lebanon earlier in the day, reportedly injuring six civilians
including a child and one guerrilla.

	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ A bomb exploded inside a crowded
Planet Hollywood restaurant Tuesday, killing one person and
injuring 24. A man claiming responsibility said it was revenge for
U.S. attacks on targets in Sudan and Afghanistan.
	   The caller to the radio station Cape Talk claimed responsibility
on behalf of a group called Muslims Against Global Oppression,
according to Marianne Merten, a journalist at the station. Police
refused to comment on the call.

	   MIAMI (AP) _ Halfway across the Atlantic, Tropical Storm
Danielle strengthened into a hurricane with 85-mph (136-kph) winds
and a defined eye Tuesday.
	   Compared to the ocean-hogging Hurricane Bonnie closing on the
Carolinas, Danielle is a compact storm with a pinhole eye and
hurricane-force winds extending out only 30 miles (48 kilometers).
Storm-force winds of at least 39 mph (62 kph) stretch out 80 miles
(128 kilometers).
	   But forecasters at the National Hurricane Center in Miami expect
the storm to be as strong as Bonnie in three days while still
spinning east of the U.S. Virgin Islands.
	   With a ridge building to the north, Danielle may be forced onto
a more westward course, and a hurricane watch may be posted for
Caribbean islands as early as Tuesday night.
	   At 5 p.m. EDT (2100 GMT), Danielle was located near 16.9 north
latitude and 46.2 west longitude, or about 1,030 miles (1,648
kilometers) east of the Leeward islands. Danielle is moving
west-northwest at 21 mph (34 kph).
	   Danielle is the fourth tropical storm of the Atlantic hurricane
season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.
	   The Atlantic Basin typically has nine tropical storms each year,
with six of them becoming hurricanes, two of them intense. In 1997,
there were seven named storms, three hurricanes and one intense
hurricane.

Libya expected to approve proposal for Lockerbie trial

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libya is studying a U.S.-British proposal to
try two Libyan suspects in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 in
The Netherlands and will announce Wednesday whether it accepts the
deal, Libyan television reported.
	   The head of the Arab League, Esmat Abdel Meguid, said Tuesday he
expects Libya to accept the agreement.
	   ``The American-British proposal is compatible with the previous
Arab suggestions, which Libya has accepted,'' Abdel Meguid said
after meeting with British Ambassador David Blatherwick.
	   The United States and Britain have said they would accept a
trial by a panel of three Scottish judges under Scottish law in The
Hague.
	   The deal also says that the suspects, Abdel Basset al-Megrahi
and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, cannot be extradited from The Netherlands
and that if found guilty, they would serve their sentences in the
United Kingdom.
	   The two men are accused of planting a bomb aboard the flight,
which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people.
	   Libya's government-run television said experts and officials
were meeting to discuss the proposals and ``a detailed statement
about this will be issued ... Wednesday.''
	   Libya had long demanded that if a trial were held it should be
in a neutral country. Washington and London had insisted on a trial
on their territory.
	   At the United Nations, the Security Council began discussing a
draft resolution saying it would agree to suspend U.N. sanctions
against Libya once the suspects were handed over for trial.
	   The 7-year-old U.N. sanctions against Libya include an air
embargo and curbs on arms sales and on certain financial and travel
activities.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libya is studying a U.S.-British proposal to
try two Libyan suspects in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 in
The Netherlands and will announce Wednesday whether it accepts the
deal, Libyan television reported.
	   The head of the Arab League, Esmat Abdel Meguid, said Tuesday he
expects Libya to accept the agreement.
	   ``The American-British proposal is compatible with the previous
Arab suggestions, which Libya has accepted,'' Abdel Meguid said
after meeting with British Ambassador David Blatherwick.
	   The United States and Britain have said they would accept a
trial by a panel of three Scottish judges under Scottish law in The
Hague.
	   The deal also says that the suspects, Abdel Basset al-Megrahi
and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, cannot be extradited from The Netherlands
and that if found guilty, they would serve their sentences in the
United Kingdom.
	   The two men are accused of planting a bomb aboard the flight,
which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people.
	   Libya's government-run television said experts and officials

	   RAANANA, Israel (AP) _ New Jersey Governor Christine Todd
Whitman began her visit to Israel Tuesday with a night at the
symphony and said she would talks hi-tech trade and politics in a
meeting later with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   As for seeking a ticket as the Republican party's vice
presidential candidate, Whitman said ``You don't seek the vice
presidency, it seeks you.''
	   Whitman is in Israel to receive an award Thursday from a large
Jewish seminary for her efforts in fostering special relations
between Israel and New Jersey. Former British prime minister
Margaret Thatcher and U.S. Senator Joseph Biden, D-Delaware, are
among several prominent figures also receiving awards from the
Aisha Torah seminary.
	   In the central Israeli city of Raanana, from New Jersey has a
trade office, Whitman said she was not afraid to be in the region,
despite recent threats by Islamic militants to strike at Israeli
and American targets in retaliation for U.S. missile strikes
against Sudan and Afghanistan.
	   ``It's such a roll of the dice. If something is going to happen
you can't predict where,'' she said.
	   Whitman said she mostly wanted to ``renew old acquaintances and
do very little business,'' on her four day trip.
	   The governor is scheduled to meet with Netanyahu Thursday and
said the two will discuss the future of hi-tech, trade and the
stalled Mideast peace process.
	   ``We all want stability. I would love to see negotiations
resume,'' Whitman said of Israeli-Palestinian peace talks which
have been stuck for 17 months over a long overdue Israeli troop
withdrawal from the West Bank.
	   Whitman also said that she was interested in expanding trade
ties with the struggling Palestinian Authority, which would be
mutually beneficial for both sides. ``At the moment there is no
formal agreement with the Palestinians. We want to be more active
in Palestinian areas, economic expansion is important to stability
and peace,'' she said.
	   Tuesday evening, Whitman attended the Raanana symphony whose
muscicians are mostly immigrants fromt he former Soviet Union, and
later had dinner with the city's mayor Zvi Bialski.

Security Council: Cooperation must resume on peace accord
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The secretary-general's personal envoy
briefed the Security Council on Tuesday about his trip to Angola,
where fighting threatens a U.N.-brokered peace accord, and could
influence the outcome of a rebellion in neighboring Congo.
	   After Lakhdar Brahimi's briefing, Danilo Turk of Slovenia, the
council president, expressed ``grave concern'' over the lack of
progress for a peaceful settlement and outbreaks of renewed
fighting in the former Portuguese colony.
	   ``The members of the Security Council no longer find acceptable
further setbacks or procrastination in the peace process under any
pretext,'' said Turk, who blamed the former rebel movement UNITA
for the fighting. Brahimi made no comment to reporters.
	   The renewed fighting could influence events in Congo.
	   In a statement Tuesday faxed to The Associated Press in Lisbon,
UNITA said it had interests to defend in Congo but stopped short of
openly acknowledging support for rebels fighting to unseat
President Laurent Kabila.
	   The Angolan government, which fought a two-decade civil war
against UNITA before the 1994 U.N. peace accord, is providing
military support for Kabila against a coalition of ethnic Tutsi
gunmen and disenchanted members of Kabila's military.
	   ``UNITA cannot accept, for any reason, Angola's military
intervention'' in Congo, the statement said. ``If (the Angolan
government) feels it has interests to defend in the region, then
let it be known that UNITA also has.''
	   A UNITA representative in Lisbon said his movement could not
provide military support because it demobilized all its troops as
part of the peace accord.
	   The Angolan government claims UNITA, a Portuguese acronym for
the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, has some
25,000 troops hidden away.
	   Angola's entry into Congo's civil war may be driven by
government concerns that Kabila's departure could usher in a new
administration sympathetic to UNITA.
	   Angola last year helped Kabila oust President Mobutu Sese Seko,
the long-time ruler of then-Zaire and an ally of UNITA leader Jonas
Savimbi.
	   In return, Kabila agreed to cut off UNITA's supply lines between
the two countries that allowed UNITA to smuggle out diamonds and
bring in military equipment, according to the government.
	   Brahimi visited Angola several weeks ago in an effort to defuse
tensions. The Security Council also recently extended the stay of
U.N. military observers in Angola until Sept. 15.

Duval, Furyk win Fred Meyer, Arnie gets the applause
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW with Tuesday's play &QL; 
 &UR; By LANDON HALL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ALOHA, Oregon (AP) _ David Duval and Jim Furyk won the punch
bowl and denim jackets. Arnold Palmer, however, was the star of the
final round of the Fred Meyer Challenge on Tuesday.
	   Palmer, who next week will begin seven weeks of daily radiation
therapy related to his prostate cancer surgery, said he may return
to competition before the treatment is completed.
	   ``I think the doctors will let me do what I want to, whatever I
feel like doing,'' Palmer, 68, said. ``Hopefully, this is just a
momentary delay.''
	   Duval and Furyk, who began the day two shots off the lead in the
best-ball, 24-player charity tournament, had five birdies in the
first seven holes and ran away with the tournament and dlrs 150,000
in prize money.
	   The pair shot 11-under par for the day, finishing at 18-under
126. Craig Stadler and Steve Elkington, who led after Monday's
first round, tied for second with Paul Stankowski and Scott
McCarron at 14-under 130.
	   Three teams _ Brad Faxon and Billy Andrade, Stewart Cink and
Steve Jones, and Fuzzy Zoeller and John Daly _ were five strokes
back. Faxon had eagles on Nos. 15 and 16.
	   Palmer and his partner, Challenge founder Peter Jacobsen,
finished nine strokes back.
	   Players all over the Reserve Vineyards and Golf Club were still
talking about Palmer's first-round 69. They also spoke about his
long list of accomplishments in a way that almost sounded like a
going-away party.
	   ``Arnold's the king, the king of golf,'' Stankowski said. ``You
can't say he's done a lot for the game _ he's done everything for
the game.''
	   ``We don't think of Arnie as being one of the older guys on the
senior tour. He's one of the young guys out here,'' Zoeller said.
	   Duval rebounded from a terrible showing in the PGA Championship
two weeks ago, in which he failed to make the cut after finishing
second in the Masters, 11th in the British Open and seventh in the
U.S. Open.
	   ``The golf course and I didn't agree. We're not on speaking
terms,'' said Duval, who is second on the PGA Tour money list
behind Vijay Singh. ``I didn't see a lot of putts going in the hole
the past couple weeks, but I saw a lot of putts going in the hole
these last two days.''
	   He and Furyk led Cink and Jones by just one stroke after nine
holes, but Furyk and Duval birdied Nos. 10-13 to pull away. They
got away with pars on the par-5 16th and 18th.
	   ``It was just kind of our day,'' said Furyk, who with Duval was
presented a crystal bowl and twin denim jackets.
	   The day also was kind for the perpetually troubled John Daly.
Earlier this month, Daly said he wouldn't play another PGA Tour
event this year, then withdrew from the Sprint International in
Denver.
	   Daly, wearing a jacket despite the 80-degree heat, looked
relaxed playing alongside Zoeller. The two friends smoked
cigarettes, chatted with the galleries and made a run at the
leaders before faltering with pars on Nos. 15-17.
	   ``He's going to play,'' Zoeller said, dismissing Daly's vow to
sit out the rest of the tour season. ``Sometimes you have to say
some negative things to yourself to motivate yourself.''
	   Daly didn't speak to reporters, but during the awards ceremony
thanked Jacobsen and the other pros for supporting him as he
continues to recover from alcohol addiction.
	   ``I just want to thank from the bottom of my heart the players.
You guys know what I'm going through.''

Judge orders suspension of night soccer matches in Argentina
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ An Argentine judge ordered
Tuesday the temporary suspension of night games in the country's
first-division soccer league.
	   One Saturday night game has already been rescheduled for Sunday
afternoon and league officials are meeting Tuesday night to
determine how to rearrange the times of upcoming night games.
	   Worried about continuing fan violence and behavior, Judge Victor
Perrota had threatened Monday to suspend league play for a second
time this year if league officials didn't take additional security
steps.
	   Perrota ordered a suspension of play in May, reacting to a
violent weekend which involved two shootings and an outbreak of
scuffles and rock throwing.
	   This time Perrota was motivated by a weekend game cut short by
an electricity outage where fans lit fires and set off fireworks.
	   ``I'm almost sure the firecrackers and confetti were set on fire
inside the stadium,'' Perrotta told a local radio station Monday
night.
	   ``It was neglect on the part of some stadium official and
someone is going to have to give an explanation,'' he said.
	   Perrota said fan movements are more difficult to follow during
night games. League officials say the new arrangement may
jeopardize already agreed upon ``pay-per-view'' contracts with
cable stations.
	   Nevertheless, Perrota says he is undettered.
	   ``I'm not going to wait for something bad to happen,'' the judge
said.

<TEXT>
	   KIRYAT SHEMONA, Israel (AP) _ Katyusha rockets slammed into
northern Israeli towns Tuesday night, injuring at least 19 people,
after a top Lebanese guerrilla leader was killed by an Israeli
helicopter that ambushed his car in south Lebanon.
	   Along the northern border, Israeli residents dashed for shelters
after the rockets took them by surprise.
	   ``People are in panic, in panic and fear. There are the wails of
women and children - don't even ask about it,'' Samir Sulidan, a
resident told Israel radio.
	   The barrage fell only hours after an Israeli helicopter gunship
fired a rocket killing guerrilla commander Hossam al-Amin,
reportedly the second-in-command of the military faction of Shiite
Amal, as he was driving along the south Lebanese coastal road not
far from the Israeli border.
	   A spokesman for Amal in Lebanon acknowledged the killing, but
declined to give al-Amin's rank.
	   The second, larger Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla group
issued a statement in Beirut claiming responsibilty for the attack.
	   The statement, carried on guerrilla radio Al-Noor, said the
attack was meant as a ``deterrent to the enemy ... so they
understand that there is no security for civilians in their
settlements as long as our civilians are killed and attacked.'' The
statement made no mention of the dead Amal commander.
	   Guerrilla groups have been waging a long war against Israeli
troops stationed in south Lebanon since 1985 to prevent cross
border attacks on its northern communities.
	   Both sides have suffered heavy casualties in the fighting but
rocket attacks such as Tuesday's strike are rare and have the
potential to escalate the conflict. After a series of rocket
attacks in 1996, Israel waged a 17-day air strike against guerrilla
targets in which over 100 Lebanese civilians were killed.
	   Five hours before the rockets fell Tuesday, Israeli Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai warned both Amal and Hezbollah not to
take retaliatory action, such as firing Katyusha rockets at Israel.
	   ``I would not advise anyone on the other side to take action in
response. We reserve the right and have legitimate cause to act as
long as we need to against leaders of terrorism and terrorism
itself wherever it is found,'' Mordechai said, speaking to
reporters.
	   The Israeli army said al-Amin ``was personally responsible for
the planning and execution of many terrorist acts by Amal against
the Israeli army,'' in Israelis security zone.
	   Six years ago, in February 1992, Israel killed another guerrilla
leader in much the same way. Then, an Israeli helicopter ambushed a
car in south Lebanon and killed Hezbollah leader Sheik Abbas
Musawi, his wife and five-year-old son.
	   One month later, the group retaliated by bombing the Israeli
embassy in Buenos Aires, Argentina, killing 29 people and wounding
dozens.
	   Israel went after Hezbollah again in 1994 with a major air
strike, killing about 50 guerrillas in a base in eastern Lebanon.
Hezbollah issued warnings it would strike in retribution, and one
month later, the Jewish community center in Buenos Aires was bombed
on July 18, killing 95 people.
	   Security officials in Lebanon, who spoke on customary condition
of anonymity, said 63 rockets were launched from Lebanon but it was
unclear how many landed in Israel.
	   The Israeli army confirmed in a statement that ``several
rockets,'' fell along the northern border, including Israel's
Western Galilee area where electricity was out in dozens of
Kibbutzim as a result of the strike.
	   The rockets left large craters in the earth and set off small
brush fires in fields. One parked truck was directly hit and
destroyed. Another rocket smashed into a side of a house but no one
was home.
	   Shmuel Abutboul, a spokesman for the Kiryat Shemona area
hospital said that 19 people were being treated for light injuries
which included trauma and shock. The army said two soldiers were
among those hurt from the rocket attacks.
	   Raanan Aloni, a resident of Kiryat Shemona, said that a first
set of rockets hit the center of the 14,000 resident town at
approximately 9:45pm (18:45gmt). One rocket crashed into the house
next door but no one was home, he said. ``Other neighbors ran to
shelters,'' Aloni told Israel radio.
	   A later army statement condemned the rocket attack, calling it
``a violation of understandings,'' brokered by former U.S.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher after the April 1996 air
strike.
	   Israeli warplanes also attacked suspected guerrilla hideouts in
south Lebanon earlier in the day, reportedly injuring six civilians
including a child and one guerrilla.

Freeman set to withdraw from games

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ World 400-meter champion Cathy Freeman
is expected to withdraw from Australia's Commonwealth Games team on
Wednesday because of a foot injury.
	   Freeman's coach-manager Nick Bideau said the Atlanta silver
medalist has a stress reaction in the bone of her left foot.
	   She has not run anywhere near her top speed since the Oslo
Golden League event on July 9 and running with the injury in the
Kuala Lumpur games is considered a possible long-term risk.
	   Freeman is the defending Commonwealth 200- and 400-meter
champion from the 1994 edition in Victoria, Canada.

<TEXT>
	   KIRYAT SHEMONA, Israel (AP) _ Katyusha rockets slammed into
northern Israeli towns Tuesday night, injuring at least 19 people,
after a top Lebanese guerrilla leader was killed by an Israeli
helicopter that ambushed his car in south Lebanon.
	   Along the northern border, Israeli residents dashed for shelters
after the rockets took them by surprise.
	   ``People are in panic, in panic and fear. There are the wails of
women and children - don't even ask about it,'' Samir Sulidan, a
resident told Israel radio.
	   The barrage fell only hours after an Israeli helicopter gunship
fired a rocket killing guerrilla commander Hossam al-Amin,
reportedly the second-in-command of the military faction of Shiite
Amal, as he was driving along the south Lebanese coastal road not
far from the Israeli border.
	   A spokesman for Amal in Lebanon acknowledged the killing, but
declined to give al-Amin's rank.
	   The second, larger Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla group
issued a statement in Beirut claiming responsibilty for the attack.
	   The statement, carried on guerrilla radio Al-Noor, said the
attack was meant as a ``deterrent to the enemy ... so they
understand that there is no security for civilians in their
settlements as long as our civilians are killed and attacked.'' The
statement made no mention of the dead Amal commander.
	   Guerrilla groups have been waging a long war against Israeli
troops stationed in south Lebanon since 1985 to prevent cross
border attacks on its northern communities.
	   Both sides have suffered heavy casualties in the fighting but
rocket attacks such as Tuesday's strike are rare and have the
potential to escalate the conflict. After a series of rocket
attacks in 1996, Israel waged a 17-day air strike against guerrilla
targets in which over 100 Lebanese civilians were killed.
	   Five hours before the rockets fell Tuesday, Israeli Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai warned both Amal and Hezbollah not to
take retaliatory action, such as firing Katyusha rockets at Israel.
	   ``I would not advise anyone on the other side to take action in
response. We reserve the right and have legitimate cause to act as
long as we need to against leaders of terrorism and terrorism
itself wherever it is found,'' Mordechai said, speaking to
reporters.
	   The Israeli army said al-Amin ``was personally responsible for
the planning and execution of many terrorist acts by Amal against
the Israeli army,'' in Israelis security zone.
	   Six years ago, in February 1992, Israel killed another guerrilla
leader in much the same way. Then, an Israeli helicopter ambushed a
car in south Lebanon and killed Hezbollah leader Sheik Abbas
Musawi, his wife and five-year-old son.
	   One month later, the group retaliated by bombing the Israeli
embassy in Buenos Aires, Argentina, killing 29 people and wounding
dozens.
	   Israel went after Hezbollah again in 1994 with a major air
strike, killing about 50 guerrillas in a base in eastern Lebanon.
Hezbollah issued warnings it would strike in retribution, and one
month later, the Jewish community center in Buenos Aires was bombed
on July 18, killing 95 people.
	   Security officials in Lebanon, who spoke on customary condition
of anonymity, said 63 rockets were launched from Lebanon but it was
unclear how many landed in Israel.
	   The Israeli army confirmed in a statement that ``several
rockets,'' fell along the northern border, including Israel's
Western Galilee area where electricity was out in dozens of
Kibbutzim as a result of the strike.
	   Shmuel Abutboul, a spokesman for the Kiryat Shemona area
hospital said that 19 people were being treated for light injuries
which included trauma and shock. The army said two soldiers were
among those hurt from the rocket attacks.

Catholic bishops say papal cross should stay
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with statement by bishops &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CZESTOCHOWA, Poland (AP) _ Catholic bishops called Tuesday for a
large cross standing near the Auschwitz Nazi death camp to stay in
place, but for other smaller crosses recently planted next to it to
be removed.
	   The statement by the Council of the Episcopate, the highest body
of Poland's Catholic church, was intended to calm a growing
controversy over the crosses, which are opposed by Jewish groups
around the world.
	   In the statement issued late Tuesday night after the first day
of a two-day conference, the bishops mixed appeals for tolerance
with their insistence that the cross was a fitting symbol to
commemorate Polish victims of the Nazis.
	   More than 100 crosses have been set up by Poles in a field
bordering Auschwitz in recent weeks to protest Jewish demands to
remove the larger cross, which has stood on the site for almost a
decade.
	   The larger cross was used during a 1979 Mass celebrated by Pope
John Paul II at Birkenau, the sister camp of Auschwitz. It
commemorates 152 Poles killed by Nazis on the site in 1941.
	   Jewish groups say the large cross, which can be seen from inside
Auschwitz, disturbs the memory of the more than 1 million Jews
killed at Auschwitz-Birkenau by the Nazis.
	   ``The cross standing in a place where 152 people were executed
deserves respect as much as religious symbols of those who died in
the camp,'' said the bishops' statement.
	   It expressed ``conviction'' that the papal cross ``will remain
in place,'' adding that the bishops ``trust that the newly planted
crosses will find a respectful place in our parishes and
churches.''
	   The statement also appealed for people to stop planting
additional crosses, saying the ``escalating conflict brings harm to
the church and turns against our homeland.''
	   A similar appeal last week by Cardinal Jozef Glemp went
unheeded, with scores of new crosses appearing at the site on
Sunday.
	   The bishops distinguished between those who put up the
additional crosses and ultra-conservative Catholics who inspired
the campaign.
	   ``People who planted the crosses acted in good faith but they
made the cross an instrument of unrest,'' the statement said.
``Such action harms both the memory of murdered victims and the
good of the church and the nation, and painfully harms the
different sensitivity of our brothers, the Jews.''
	   In another reference to the suffering of Jews at Auschwitz, the
bishops noted the ``special way'' in which they were ``harmed by
this tragedy.'' They called for Jews and Catholics to resume
discussions on how to maintain the Auschwitz-Birkenau complex.
	   Because of the papal cross, Jewish groups have refused to sign a
dlrs 93.5 million agreement reached last year for preserving
Auschwitz-Birkenau.
	   But the bishops' statement showed the church, a powerful force
in predominantly Catholic Poland, and Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek's
government were united in wanting to keep the papal cross next to
Auschwitz.
	   The bishops lack any legal power to over the land where the
crosses stand, but their statement was considered a powerful signal
from the church and likely to be heeded by all but the wildly
anti-Semitic ultra-conservative Catholics.

Guaranteed contracts hearing to resume Sept. 3
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC;

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The National Basketball Association's guaranteed
contracts arbitration hearing is going to take a lot longer than
expected.
	   A nine-day adjournment was announced Tuesday, meaning a verdict
might not come until October when training camps are due to open.
	   Tuesday was supposed to have been the final day of the two-day
hearing. Instead, three additional days have been added, Sept. 3, 4
and 8.
	   Arbitrator John Feerick will have 30 days to render his
decision, which could eat up a huge chunk of the time the sides
would have had to work out a new collective bargaining agreement
and possibly start the season on time Nov. 4.
	   Training camps are scheduled to open Oct. 6.
	   The league said Sept. 3 was the next mutually agreeable date for
the owners, players and arbitrator, although the union claimed
commissioner David Stern's vacation plans and the start of the
semester at Fordham University, where Feerick is a law school dean,
necessitated the nine-day adjournment.
	   The hearing lasted for another 6 1/2 hours Tuesday, for a total
of 14 hours over two days. Union lawyer Ron Klempner was the only
witness on Day 2, and lawyers for each side also spent time arguing
the admissibility of certain documents _ including a contract
containing unique lockout language signed by Sacramento Kings
center Olden Polynice in 1994.
	   Having a longer-than-expected hearing before Feerick is nothing
new for Stern, deputy commissioner Russ Granik, union director
Billy Hunter and their lawyers. When Feerick held the Latrell
Sprewell hearing last February, it was supposed to last four days
but went nine.
	   ``Our position hasn't changed. We want to litigate and resolve
this issue as soon as possible on behalf of our players. We're
looking forward to resuming the hearing,'' Hunter said.
	   This hearing concerns the union's claim that owners should be
liable to pay some dlrs 800 million worth of salaries due to 220
players who have guaranteed contracts for the upcoming season.
	   Lawyers for the league contend employees never get paid during
lockouts.
	   The union says NBA owners should have protected themselves, as
baseball owners do, with contract language making specific mention
that players would not be paid during a lockout.
	   ``In baseball, that was a component of the owners' strategy.
They began inserting lockout language into guaranteed contracts in
1988 and 1989 in anticipation of a work stoppage in 1990,'' said
Eugene Orza, general counsel for the Major League Baseball Players
Association.
	   Major league owners eventually imposed a lockout in the spring
of 1990, but that dispute was settled and all 162 games were
played, meaning no player lost any salary.
	   In the only other baseball lockout, in 1976, there were no
guaranteed contracts to fight over, Orza said.
	   When hockey players were locked out in 1994, they did not seek
to be paid. Nor did NBA players who were locked out in the summer
of 1995.

	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ A bomb exploded inside a crowded
Planet Hollywood restaurant Tuesday, killing one person and
injuring 24. A man claiming responsibility said it was revenge for
U.S. attacks on targets in Sudan and Afghanistan.
	   The caller to the radio station Cape Talk claimed responsibility
on behalf of a group called Muslims Against Global Oppression,
according to Marianne Merten, a journalist at the station. Police
refused to comment on the call.
	   The U.S. State Department said the group was anti-Jewish and
anti-Israeli. It was unknown to the department's counter-terrorism
office until it staged a demonstration at the vacant Israeli
diplomatic office in Capetown in July 1997, officials said. The
marchers shouted slogans against Israel.
	   Department officials said they did not know whether Muslims
Against Global Oppression had a hand in Tuesday's attack at the
restaurant.
	   Some people claiming to be members were among the 40 or so
people who protested U.S. policies on Iraq and Israel during
President Bill Clinton's visit to Cape Town last March.
	   The device exploded at 7:20 p.m. (1720 GMT) inside Planet
Hollywood, killing a woman and injuring 24 other people, said
police Senior Superintendent John Sterrenberg. Nationalities and
other details were unknown. U.S. consular officials were reportedly
on the scene to see if Americans were among the victims.
	   A witness who had been at the ground-floor bar in the two-story
Hollywood-theme restaurant described a horrific scene.
	   ``I saw people without limbs,'' Bertie Liebenberg, who was
visiting from Johannesburg, told the South African Press
Association. ``Decor on the ceiling came crashing down, and crashed
onto people, tables and chairs.''
	   Roger Sedres, a local photographer, said he heard the explosion
as he drove past the restaurant, then saw the wounded come
streaming out.
	   One woman sat outside the restaurant, her head in her hands,
screaming: ``Oh God, please tell me my legs are still there,''
Sedres said. The woman's legs were intact.
	   Rescue workers brought out another woman who was motionless,
with mangled legs.
	   Police cordoned off the restaurant in the trendy Victoria and
Albert Waterfront and were reinforced with armored cars. Ambulances
with sirens wailing went to the scene and soon a crowd of onlookers
and journalists gathered.
	   ``It's a shame,'' said onlooker Patty McGoughran, of Washington
D.C., who was on business in South Africa installing computers.
``It's such a beautiful place, and this is appalling. We are scared
after things like Nairobi. But we thought we were safe here.''
	   President Nelson Mandela's minister of security, Sydney
Mufamadi, surveyed the damage and pledged to hunt down the bombers.
	   Nico Smuts, spokesman for Leisurenet, franchise holders of
Planet Hollywood, said the Cape Town branch was wholly South
African-owned.
	   With the restaurant chain originating in the United States,
there was speculation the attack might be a sequel to the bombings
of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 257
people on Aug. 7, or an answer to America's retaliatory
cruise-missile attacks on targets in Afghanistan and Sudan.
	   ``If these rumors are true, the attackers had it completely
wrong because except for the name and franchise, the Waterfront
Planet Hollywood is owned by Cape Town businessmen,'' Smuts said.
	   A statement from Matt Hallman, director of public relations for
Planet Hollywood, ``Our hearts and prayers go out to all the
injured and their families.'' He said the company was gathering
information about the attack.

	   PARIS (AP) _ An Ariane rocket launched from French Guiana
carried a telecommunications satellite into orbit for Singapore and
Taiwan, officials said early Wednesday.
	   The 109th launch of an Ariane rocket, built by the European
Space Agency, took place at 8:07 p.m. (2307 GMT) Tuesday in Kourou,
French Guiana, on the northeastern edge of South America.
	   Built by Matra Marconi Space for Singapore Telecom and Chunghwa
Telecom of Taiwan, the ST-1 telecommunications satellite, in orbit
over the Indian Ocean, will cover the Middle East and Far East for
the next 12 years.
	   It was the first launch in four months. Since April 28, the
rocket was grounded by satellite glitches or delivery delays.
	   Seven other launches will be necessary before the end of the
year to catch up with the delays, with the next shot planned for
mid-September for the American company Panamsat.

Near miss reported between Japanese airliner, U.S. military jet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment from U.S. military &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese aviation authorities said Tuesday they are
investigating a reported near miss between a Japanese commercial
airliner and a U.S. military jet in skies near Tokyo.
	   The pilot of a Japan Airlines DC-10 reported that an
anti-collision system kicked in last Wednesday to avoid a possible
crash, said Masanobu Tokumaru, a safety inspection officer at the
Transport Ministry.
	   Tokumaru said the U.S. military in Japan notified the ministry
that an American F-18 jet was flying nearby at the time. He said
Japanese aviation officials are investigating.
	   Tokumaru said the Japanese carrier was flying at an altitude of
about 5,800 meters (19,024 feet) and ascending, when its pilot
discovered the military jet flying below from right to left at 7:25
a.m. (2225 GMT) Wednesday morning, Tokumaru said.
	   The two planes were flying at different altitudes about 160
meters (525 feet) apart over Sagami city, 40 kilometers (25 miles)
west of Tokyo, Tokumaru quoted the Japanese pilot as reporting to
the ministry Monday.
	   None of the 147 passengers and 10 crew members aboard the DC-10,
which was en route to Hiroshima from Tokyo's Haneda airport, were
injured, Tokumaru said.
	   A Navy F-18 flying in the area received permission from Tokyo
air traffic controllers to raise its altitude and flew close enough
for the civilian pilot to see it, said Maj. Stephen Clutter, a
spokesman at Yokota Air Force base, near Tokyo.
	   ``The aircraft certainly set off the civilian airliner's
collision avoidance system, but I'm not sure (exactly) how close
they were,'' Clutter said.
	   ``We're still reviewing what happened. We suspect there was some
breakdown in communication between the controllers,'' he said.
	   Japanese civilian pilots have frequently complained of problems
with the flight routes of U.S. military aircraft, and want more
limitations on their flight paths and tighter restrictions on the
type of training missions they can conduct.
	   Also Tuesday, about 120 local government officials from western
Japan gathered in Hiroshima Prefecture (state) to call for an end
to low-altitude U.S. military training flights.
	   Participants said they were concerned about noise and vibration
from the jets and worried about the possibility of a crash, said
Kiyotaka Fujiwara, the mayor of the village of Kimita where the
rally was held.
	   The group of mostly small town mayors agreed they must join
together to urge the central government to ban the flights,
Fujiwara said.
	   U.S. military planes are exempt from rules that require Japanese
warplanes to conduct low-altitude training away from civil aviation
routes.
	   It is also legal for American planes to train at very low
altitudes over populated areas and fly without following
instructions from commercial control towers.
	   About 47,000 U.S. military personnel are stationed in Japan
under mutual security arrangements between the two countries.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ A bomb exploded inside a crowded
Planet Hollywood restaurant Tuesday, killing one person and
injuring 24. A man claiming responsibility said it was revenge for
U.S. attacks on targets in Sudan and Afghanistan. The caller to the
radio station Cape Talk claimed responsibility on behalf of a group
called Muslims Against Global Oppression, according to Marianne
Merten, a journalist at the station. Police refused to comment on
the call. Little is known about the group. Some people claiming to
be members were among the 40 or so people who protested U.S.
policies on Iraq and Israel during President Bill Clinton's visit
to Cape Town last March. The device exploded at 7:20 p.m. inside
the U.S.-based restaurant, killing a woman and injuring 24 other
people. (SOUTH AFRICA-EXPLOSION)
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Fortified by the support of allied troops
and air support, President Laurent Kabila returned Tuesday with
fanfare to Congo's capital while the government prepared to strike
at the heart of rebel-held territory in the east. Kabila's
motorcade _ a caravan of black limousines flanked by pickup trucks
filled with commandos _ zipped through Kinshasa's rutted streets
past cheering and waving crowds. Kabila had been away from the city
for more than week. His return came as allied warplanes from Angola
and Zimbabwe staged a series of attacks on rebel positions,
Information Minister Didier Mumengi said. He declined to give
details. (CONGO)
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libya is studying a U.S.-British proposal to
try two Libyan suspects in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 in
The Netherlands and will announce Wednesday whether it accepts the
deal, Libyan television reported. The head of the Arab League,
Esmat Abdel Meguid, said Tuesday he expects Libya to accept the
agreement. The United States and Britain have said they would
accept a trial by a panel of three Scottish judges under Scottish
law in The Hague. (LIBYA-PAN AM BOMBING)
	   KIRYAT SHEMONA, Israel (AP) _ Katyusha rockets slammed into
northern Israeli towns Tuesday night, injuring at least 12 people,
after a top Lebanese guerrilla leader was killed by an Israeli
helicopter that ambushed his car in south Lebanon. Along the
northern border, Israeli residents dashed for shelters after the
rockets took them by surprise. ``People are in panic, in panic and
fear. There are the wails of women and children - don't even ask
about it,'' Samir Sulidan, a resident told Israel radio. The
barrage fell only hours after an Israeli helicopter gunship fired a
rocket killing guerrilla commander Hossam al-Amin, reportedly the
second-in-command of the military faction of Shiite Amal, as he was
driving along the south Lebanese coastal road not far from the
Israeli border. (ISRAEL-LEBANON)
	   NAGS HEAD, North Carolina (AP) _ More than a half-million
tourists and residents were ordered to leave the Carolina coast
Tuesday as Hurricane Bonnie closed in with gathering speed.
Hurricane-force winds could hit the coast by daybreak Wednesday. By
early afternoon, traffic was bumper-to-bumper on roads leading
inland from North Carolina's Outer Banks as people tried to get out
of the way of Bonnie, a behemoth of a storm with winds of 115 mph
(185 kmh). Many residents were unwilling to take the chance that
the first hurricane of the Atlantic season would follow the path of
some previous storms and take a last-minute turn out to sea.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Blue-chip stocks escaped with small gains
Tuesday, but only after a bigger rally unraveled as a long list of
global uncertainties proved too hard to ignore. The Dow Jones
industrial average finished just 36 points higher at 8,602 after
retreating from a 122-point gain and briefly dipping into negative
terrain. Several broad-market indexes also finished higher, but the
number of declining issues surpassed advancers despite trailing by
a substantial margin in the morning. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin approved
a plan Tuesday to restructure dlrs 40 billion in short-term debt,
including more than dlrs 11 billion in bonds held by foreign
investors. The national currency signaled continuing fears for
Russia's economic future, plunging 10 percent Tuesday in the worst
fall in almost four years. The terms of the restructuring will
require investors to switch into much longer-term paper denominated
either in rubles or dollars. Investors switching into dollars will
have to accept a much lower-yielding coupon. In return for their
ruble-denominated treasury certificates, investors would receive a
dollar-denominated bond maturing in 2006 with a 5 percent coupon.
(RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ In the rivalry between Airbus Industrie
and the Boeing Co., the Europeans scored a victory over the
Americans on Tuesday as British Airways announced its first-ever
order of Airbus jets. The Airbus chief executive, Noel Forgeard,
called it the ``crowning achievement of a successful commercial
year,'' but British Airways was more blunt. ``They were
significantly cheaper,'' chief executive Bob Ayling said after
announcing 59 firm orders of short-haul Airbus jets and options on
another 129. Ayling said British Airways will stay a good customer
to Boeing, after also announcing Tuesday it will order 16 Boeing
777s, with options for 16 more. (BRITISH AIRWAYS-JETS)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Leading European insurance companies signed an
agreement Tuesday to resolve the unpaid Nazi-era polices of
Holocaust victims, even though attorneys for survivors remain
opposed, said a key member of the negotiation team. The agreement _
independent of pending class-action lawsuits _ was negotiated by
the World Jewish Congress, the National Association of Insurance
Commissioners and European insurance companies. The memorandum of
understanding establishes an international commission that would
examine the companies' archives, set up a process to resolve claims
and determine a company's liability, said Neil D. Levin, vice
chairman of the commissioners group negotiating taskforce and
superintendent of the New York State Insurance Department. The
amount of the claims is not immediately known, but is expected to
be well into the hundreds of millions. (US-HOLOCAUST INSURANCE)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Consumer confidence fell for a second straight
month in August as Americans worried about gyrations in global
stock markets and new political turmoil stemming from attacks on
U.S. embassies in Africa. The Conference Board reported Tuesday
that its index of consumer confidence fell 4.1 points to 133.1 in
August from a revised 137.2 reached in July. August's decline was
larger than Wall Street analysts' had expected. Consumer sentiment
is important because consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of
the nation's overall economic activity. The report comes as
economists scour new data for signs pointing to the direction of
the economy. Many worry that Asia's economic crisis, as well as
financial troubles in Russia and Latin America, will drag down the
U.S. economy and hurt corporate profits. (US-ECONOMY)
	   ROME (AP) _ Prime Minister Romano Prodi returned from vacation
Tuesday to take a first look at Italy's proposed 1999 budget _
opening day of what threatens to be an autumn of battles over job
creation. In the outline presented by Treasury Minister Carlo
Azeglio Ciampi, Prodi's government again asks for greater
flexibility from labor, saying the payoff will be increased
investment and employment. With unemployment at about 12 percent,
labor leaders say they are tired of waiting for jobs from Prodi's
now 2-year-old government. Top labor leader Sergio D'Antonio
renewed threats of a strike if the government doesn't go far enough
in boosting jobs and in investing in Italy's depressed south. The
government plans to present the budget to Parliament at the end of
September. (ITALY-BUDGET)

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Leonardo DiCaprio is out as the serial killer
in ``American Psycho.''
	   The ``Titanic'' star in search of an encore and the independent
studio Lions Gate Films couldn't agree on a starting date, the Los
Angeles Times and the New York Daily News reported Tuesday, citing
unidentified sources.
	   DiCaprio's spokeswoman, Cindy Guagenti, said only that the actor
is scheduled to begin filming ``The Beach'' in January.
	   The 23-year-old's interest in ``American Psycho,'' an adaptation
of the Bret Easton Ellis novel, made headlines two months ago.
	   ___
	   SANTA MONICA, California (AP) _ Priscilla Presley won dlrs
75,000 in a defamation lawsuit against a man who claimed they had
an affair before she married Elvis Presley.
	   Superior Court Judge Daniel A. Curry ruled Aug. 19 that Lavern
Currie Grant, a former Army buddy of Presley's, made false
statements that were repeated and used as the source for the book
``Child Bride: The Untold Story of Priscilla Beaulieu Presley'' by
Suzanne Finstad.
	   Ms. Presley has long assured the world she was a virgin when she
married The King.
	   Ms. Presley had sued for at least dlrs 10 million. Ms. Finstad
wasn't sued.
	   ``I am very pleased that I have been vindicated by this
judgment,'' Ms. Presley said in a statement.
	   ___
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ To some it might appear in bad taste,
but to Olimpiu Medar's colleagues it was the perfect way to pay
tribute to a former advertising executive killed in a car accident.
	   ``Coffee, cellular telephone, cigarettes, clients, money,
dreams, fast, fast, too fast. And Oli is no longer,'' read the
44-word obituary, which appeared Tuesday in the widely read daily
Evenimentul Zilei.
	   At first glance, the obituary and photo look like a job ad for a
local advertising company. One of Medar's former colleagues, Anca
Mandru, from Initiative Media Romania advertising company, said by
telephone: ``Each member of our creative team wanted to contribute
to his memory in this way.''
	   Medar, 33, died Saturday in a car accident that killed six
people on the Black Sea coast, some 225 kilometers (140 miles) east
of capital.
	   ___
	   MOUNT LEBANON, Pennsylvania (AP) _ Wondering if a semi-famous
celebrity is still among us? How about Sally Struthers or Ricardo
Montalban?
	   To titillate the morbidly curious, a suburban Pittsburgh woman
is keeping tabs on who's cold _ and who's just dead in Hollywood _
on her Web site, the Dead People Server.
	   ``It's informative and amusing,'' Laurie Mann, 41, who maintains
the site, said Monday. ``If you don't see someone regularly,
suddenly they're out of sight, out of mind and you're like, `Gee,
whatever did happen to Chet Huntley?'''
	   Huntley, a popular U.S. newscaster. died March 20, 1974.
Struthers, who starred in the 1970s TV comedy ``All in the
Family,'' and Montalban, once a film and TV star, are both alive.
	   ___
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ The ambulance that took a mortally wounded
Lee Harvey Oswald away in front of millions of TV viewers in 1963
is going on the auction block.
	   The 1962 cream-colored Ford will be among the cars for sale at
the Sept. 2-8 Kruse International Auburn '98 Auction in Auburn,
Indiana.
	   President John F. Kennedy's killer was shot to death by
nightclub owner Jack Ruby on live television two days after the
assassination. The ambulance took Oswald to Parkland Hospital in
Dallas.
	   The ambulance is now owned by an Ocala, Florida, car collector.
It is expected to fetch dlrs 30,000 to dlrs 100,000.
	   ``Anything that conjures up memories of those dark days holds a
fascination for the public and this car probably will see a new
home in a museum because of it,'' Kruse International president
Mitchell Kruse said.
	   ___
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ It's a beauty pageant with an information
technology twist.
	   Twelve contestants for Miss Internet Singapore will parade in
business suits and answer Internet trivia questions by typing on
laptops in the pageant finals Saturday night.
	   From Aug. 1-21, anyone able to log onto the Miss Internet
Singapore web site had the chance to view pictures of the
finalists, listen to their voices, read about their hopes on their
home pages, and vote for them by sending an e-mail or voice mail.
	   Judges chose the 12 finalists _ aged 15 to 26 _ after
interviewing some of the 620 applicants, who signed up online.
	   Internet knowledge counts for 60 percent of the final points
tally, but the contestants are also judged on how they look in
evening wear and in workout clothes _ leotards, shorts and
sleeveless T-shirts.
	   ``The great thing about this pageant is that it does not test us
strictly on our Internet skills _ it's about beauty as well,''
contestant Stella Tan, 23, a molecular biology student, told a
local newespaper.
	   Signaporeans already date through the Internet, and use it for
everything from paying taxes to ordering taxis.

One Congo or many? War splinters mammoth Congo

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Armies marching east and west may
eventually prevail on Congo's battlefields.
	   But a growing number of people believe the war may split the
country _ already carved up along regional, linguistic, ethnic and
now warring lines _ into several smaller states.
	   ``What we've looked at is whether Congo works as a national
entity,'' said Anicet Kashamura, the president of the commission
charged with drafting a constitution for the country.
	   Already, Congo appears split.
	   ``That's a real fear,'' said Learned Dees, an Africa analyst
with the National Endowment for Democracy in Washington. ``You have
to look at the interests of the countries becoming involved.''
	   Lending support for President Laurent Kabila, allied troops from
Angola and Zimbabwe have poured into the capital, Kinshasa, and a
western corridor of land that runs from Kinshasa to the Atlantic
Ocean.
	   Rebel forces backed by Rwanda and Uganda, meanwhile, are firmly
in control of the east.
	   As warring camps form alliances with neighboring countries that
reflect political and cultural ties, the Balkanization of Congo
into a web of smaller states may become a reality.
	   Rwanda and Uganda have security concerns in Congo's eastern and
northeastern regions.
	   Both helped Kabila to power last year, hoping he would stem
violence along their shared borders.
	   But that hasn't happened and now both countries say they may
intervene in Congo's war to protect vital interests; that is to say
they want to wipe out rebel movements that continue to stage
attacks in their countries and seek haven across the border in
Congo.
	   In the western Bandundu and Lower Congo provinces, Angola has
oil and security interests, Dees said.
	   Zimbabwe, a creditor nation to the tune of about dlrs 200
million, has a financial stake in Kabila's government.
	   The country already has been split, according to University of
Kinshasa political science professor Yewawa Gbiamango.
	   ``Angola will stay in the west, but they will face too much
resistance in the east,'' he said. In the east, ``we have two
countries, Rwanda and Uganda, determined to protect their interests
here. We risk having a country monumentally divided between east
and west.''
	   Even before Kabila ousted longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko
last year, constitutional expert Kashamura was recommending Congo
break up into a confederation-like union of four independent
states.
	   Although he says he is a nationalist, Kashamura believes Congo _
with its boundaries stretching from central Africa into the south
and the Atlantic Ocean two-thirds of the way east across the
continent _ is just too unruly.
	   Earlier this year, Kashamura told Kabila that Congo should split
up into four states along southwest, southeast, central and
northern lines. Kabila, wanting to reign over the whole of the
country, has repeatedly rejected that idea.
	   Historically, there is little reason to even view Congo as a
single entity; like most African countries, Congo was an artificial
creation of European colonialists. Originally the personal property
of the king of Belgium _ who owned a territory that spread across
dozens of ethnic and linguistic regions _ it later became a Belgian
colony before gaining its independence in 1960.
	   But a divided Congo may not make for a safer region, Dees
warned.
	   ``Just because you have smaller regional groupings with smaller
states doesn't necessarily solve the problems of security,'' he
said.
	   Mobutu held this vast land together with an iron first and the
help of Belgian and French troops.
	   That didn't stop secessionists, including Kabila, who attempted
to break up the country along regional lines.
	   Kabila in the mid-1960s launched a rebel separatist war in his
home Katanga province that was crushed by Mobutu and the help of
U.S. aircraft and Belgian paratroopers.
	   Loyalists to Congo's first prime minister, Patrice Lumumba, who
was slain during a Mobutu grab for power, revolted and tried to
establish a mirror state in the eastern Kivu region and Katanga
province.
	   Throughout the 1970s and '80s, Katanga has been subject to
sporadic rebellions and battles for independence.
	   More recently, the eastern Kivu region, even after Kabila's rise
to power has been wracked by ethnic and rebel violence.

Researcher wants financial support in return for diary pages
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs. &QL; 
 &UR; By WILLIAM J. KOLE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ In the often combative realm of
World War II research, it's the closest thing to a hostage
standoff.
	   Cor Suijk of the New York-based Anne Frank Center USA startled
scholars by saying he will turn over five missing pages of ``The
Diary of Anne Frank'' _ but only if the Dutch institute fighting to
publish them donates the proceeds to his Holocaust awareness
crusade.
	   The Netherlands State Institute for War Documentation, which
revealed the existence of the missing pages last week, expressed
astonishment Tuesday at Suijk's demands.
	   ``We've asked a lawyer to try to find a way out of this,'' said
David Barnouw, spokesman for the institute.
	   Suijk claims that Otto Frank, father of the young Jewish diarist
whose harrowing account of hiding from the Nazis has become an
international best-seller in 55 languages, gave him the pages
shortly before his death in 1980.
	   Suijk, 74, a close friend and confidante of Otto Frank and
longtime financial adviser for the Anne Frank Foundation in
Amsterdam, told RTL4 television Monday evening that the elder Frank
made him promise the pages wouldn't be published until the entire
family was dead. Suijk admitted to having the pages earlier this
month.
	   The war documentation institute has said the handwritten pages
appear to be authentic and contain Anne's ``very critical''
assessment of her parents' marriage.
	   Suijk told the station he's the ``rightful owner'' of the pages
and that he's willing to part with them only if the proceeds from
their publication _ which could generate millions of dollars _ go
to support his own work.
	   Suijk is a renowned Holocaust speaker who addresses schools and
community groups around the United States and coordinates a
traveling Anne Frank exhibition.
	   The war documentation institute, which wants the pages so they
can be included in the next edition of ``The Diary of Anne Frank,''
contends that Otto Frank never intended to make a gift of them to
Suijk.
	   Suijk did not return phone calls seeking comment Tuesday.
	   A former colleague defended both Suijk and his scholarship.
	   ``He is beyond a shadow of a doubt a man of integrity,'' Gerrold
van der Stroom, a co-editor of ``The Diary of Anne Frank _ The
Critical Edition,'' told the daily De Volkskrant.
	   The affair has become the talk of the town in the Netherlands.
The house along the Amsterdam canal where Anne and her family hid
in a secret annex behind a movable bookcase is a top tourist
attraction.
	   Anne's diary trails off in August 1944, just before the Franks
were betrayed and she was arrested and hauled off to the
Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. Starving and freezing, Anne died
there of typhus in the spring of 1945, just weeks before the camp
was liberated.
	   Her diary, a modern literary classic that has become required
reading in schools worldwide, has inspired numerous books, films
and a hit Broadway play.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Two Japanese Air Self-Defense Force F-1 fighter
jets that disappeared from radar screens while on a training flight
over the Pacific Ocean may have collided, a Defense Agency
spokesman said Wednesday.
	   The pilot of a third jet, which later returned to base, reported
that he saw a ``fireball'' near where the two F-1s are believed to
have gone missing Tuesday night, raising fears that they plunged
into the sea after a mid-air collision, said an agency spokesman.
	   A coast guard vessel, one of the six ships and six planes
engaged in searching for the jets, later found fragments in the
area, said Shoichi Suzuki, another agency spokesman.
	   Suzuki said, however, that the Defense Agency could not yet
confirm whether the fragments found came from the missing aircraft.
	   The two fighters, each single-seaters, disappeared at about 7:00
p.m. Tuesday (1000 GMT), at a point about 120 kilometers (75 miles)
southeast of the U.S. Air Force's Misawa air base.
	   The planes took off from Misawa at 6:30 p.m. Tuesday (0930 GMT),
along with the third plane, to conduct low-altitude night flying
practice, Suzuki said.
	   The jets were piloted by 1st Lt. Hirokazu Nagai and 1st Lt.
Madoka Nakaya, both 29, the spokesman said.
	   Misawa is located 560 kilometers (350 miles) northwest of Tokyo
in Aomori Prefecture, or state.

Bolstered Kabila back in Congo's capital
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 
 &UR; By IAN STEWART &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Back in his capital, President Laurent
Kabila is putting his troops and allied forces on the offensive in
eastern Congo.
	   Kabila returned to Kinshasa on Monday after spending more than a
week holed up in the southern Congolese city of Lubumbashi _ his
former rebel stronghold.
	   After recent gains in the west, government and allied Angolan
and Zimbabwean forces are planning to move east to the heart of
rebel-held territory there, Voice of the People radio reported.
	   Kabila, speaking on state-run radio, called for support among
the Congolese.
	   ``With hands or spears or by any means the people must crush the
enemy in our territory,'' he said.
	   Also in eastern Congo, Tutsi rebels killed 37 people in an
attack on a Catholic mission crowded with war refugees, Roman
Catholic Church officials in Rome said Tuesday.
	   Kabila's return came as allied warplanes from Angola and
Zimbabwe bombed rebel positions, Information Minister Didier
Mumengi said. He gave no details.
	   Rebel leaders said Angolan and Zimbabwean aircraft had bombed
the rebel-held city of Kisangani and the town of Kasangulu, about
30 kilometers (18 miles) south of Kinshasa.
	   The planes had bombed civilian targets in Kisangani, Congo's
third-largest city, rebel leader Bizima Karaha said. That city was
captured by insurgents forces just days ago.
	   ``They cannot recapture Kisangani, only bomb it from the air,''
he said. ``This is terrorism.''
	   The rebels in the west are on the defensive after a string of
victories by Congolese soldiers and their Angolan allies in a land
corridor that stretches from Kinshasa to the Atlantic Ocean.
	   Meanwhile, the Vatican's missionary news service reported that a
priest, three nuns, a seminary student and 32 refugees were killed
in the attack on the Catholic mission in eastern Congo.
	   All the dead were Congolese. The mission is in a remote parish
in east.
	   The rebels attacked because they suspected local residents of
giving food to a pro-government militia, the news service said.
	   Zimbabwean troops fighting for the government quickly became
involved in the fighting in the west, that country's defense
ministry said.
	   It said Angolan troops would soon join Congolese, Namibian and
Zimbabwean units for an offensive directed from Kinshasa.
	   Rwanda _ considered the rebels' main military and political
sponsor _ says it will intervene if the Zimbabweans and Angolans do
not withdraw.
	   Uganda has also sent troops and tanks to support the insurgents.
	   Fighting broke out earlier this month when members of Kabila's
armed forces revolted after he ordered Rwandan troops out of the
country.
	   The Rwandan soldiers _ the core of Kabila's rebel movement that
ousted Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko last year _ had stayed on
in Congo as part of the national defense force.
	   In Kinshasa, the government released a Worldwide Television News
crew that had been detained for several days. Journalists have been
repeatedly detained and harassed by authorities, who accuse the
Western media of a pro-rebel bias.

Israelis sleep in shelter after guerrillas launch rocket barrage

<TEXT>
	   KIRYAT SHEMONA, Israel (AP) _ Hundreds of Israelis slept in
underground shelters after Lebanese guerrillas launched the
heaviest barrage of Katyusha rockets in two years on Israel's
northern communities.
	   At least 19 people were injured in the attack, which came hours
after Israeli gunships tracked down and killed a senior guerrilla
leader in his car in south Lebanon.
	   Though Israeli troops and guerrillas are engaged in day-to-day
fire exchanges and often deadly combat, such cross-border attacks
are rare and have the potential to escalate the conflict. Israeli
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said army commanders were
meeting late into the night Tuesday to decide ``what our reaction
will be,'' to the rocket attack.
	   The rockets began slamming into Kiryat Shemona at about 9:45pm
(1845 GMT), just as Tomer Cohen, 23, and his bride, Irit, 22 stood
under the traditional Jewish wedding canopy taking their marriage
vows before a rabbi.
	   ``When the first barrage landed, people were hysterical and a
number of women fainted,'' said the groom's friend Yaacov Abutbul.
After a second set of rockets landed close to the outdoor ceremony
on the edge of the city, ``most of the guests left, but the
ceremony continued after a few minutes,'' he said. The bride and
groom later left for a honeymoon in Tel Aviv, away from the
fighting.
	   Another groom, Eitan Maman said ``it was very difficult getting
through the ceremony. ``It's not the wedding I expected,'' he said.
	   At least 40 rockets crashed into Israeli communities across its
northern border, sending people running for cover and ending a
15-month period of relative quiet for the Israelis. One parked
truck was directly hit and destroyed by a rocket and an empty house
was among several properties badly damaged in the attacks. Rockets
set off brush fires in fields in the Western Galilee and left large
craters in the earth where they fell.
	   The barrage fell only hours after an Israeli Apache helicopter
fired a rocket killing guerrilla commander Hossam al-Amin,
reportedly the second-in-command of the military faction of Shiite
Amal, as he was driving along the south Lebanese coastal road not
far from the Israeli border.
	   A spokesman for Amal in Lebanon acknowledged the killing, but
declined to give al-Amin's rank.
	   The second, larger Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla group
issued a statement in Beirut claiming responsibility for the
attack.
	   The statement, carried on guerrilla radio Al-Noor, said the
attack was meant as a ``deterrent to the enemy ... so they
understand that there is no security for civilians in their
settlements as long as our civilians are killed and attacked.'' The
statement made no mention of the dead Amal commander.
	   Guerrilla groups have been waging a war to oust Israeli troops
stationed in south Lebanon since 1985 to prevent cross border
attacks on its northern communities.
	   Both sides have suffered heavy casualties in the fighting. After
a series of rocket attacks in 1996, Israel waged a 17-day air
strike against guerrilla targets in which over 100 Lebanese
civilians were killed.

Bahamas offers dlrs 100,000 rewards in tourist killings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) _ The Bahamas government is offering two
dlrs 100,000 rewards for information about the killings of two
tourists whose bodies were found last weekend, Prime Minister
Hubert Ingraham said Tuesday.
	   Ingraham also said the Bahamas government was asking U.S. and
British experts to help with the investigation.
	   The body of Joanne Clarke, 24, of Oxfordshire, England and
another corpse believed to be 32-year-old Lori Fogleman of
Richmond, Virginia, were found Saturday on Paradise Island near
Nassau.
	   Police said they hoped autopsies Thursday would help them
positively identify Fogleman.
	   Clarke disappeared from a secluded area of Cabbage Beach on
Friday. Fogleman was last seen on Paradise Island July 20.
	   The two bodies were found in an area of bushes between Cabbage
Beach and the island's golf course. Fogleman's purse was found in
late July about one mile (1.5 kilometers) from the site.
	   ``These terrible, terrible crimes have outraged the entire
Bahamian population,'' Ingraham said Tuesday.
	   He said the government was paying all travel expenses for
relatives of Fogleman and Clark who are helping with the
investigation in the Bahamas.
	   Since the discovery of the bodies, police have added patrols on
Paradise Island, a popular resort area. But the island's the
beaches, normally a haven for joggers in the early morning and late
evening, have had fewer visitors.

Kribel coasts into match play at rain-delayed U.S. Amateur
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BEN DOBBIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROCHESTER, New York (AP) _ Joel Kribel, who is acutely familiar
with the agony of losing in the final stages of the U.S. Amateur,
shot a 66 Tuesday to top match-play qualifiers in the
rain-interrupted tournament.
	   After a 30-minute delay caused by lightning and heavy rain, a
downpour suspended play for the day at 7 p.m. with 94 players still
on the courses at Oak Hill, the venue for the 1995 Ryder Cup.
	   Kribel finished with a 20-foot (6-meter) birdie putt at Oak
Hill's East course for a 36-hole total of 3-under 136. Just 64
players in the field of 312 move on to match play, which continues
through Sunday. Qualifying was scheduled to resume Wednesday.
	   At 137 was Charles Howell, who shot a 3-under 67. Defending
champion Matt Kuchar double-bogeyed the final hole, but his 72 put
him safely into the next round at 3-over 142. Officials said they
expected the cutoff for qualifying to be either 6-over 145 or
7-over 146.
	   Kribel, who is entering his senior year at Stanford, lost
2-and-1 to Kuchar in last year's 36-hole final and was toppled by
Tiger Woods in the 1996 semifinals.
	   ``It's one of the most painful things I've gone through _ to
have it slip away,'' he said. ``But at the same time it feels
pretty good to have gotten as far as I have the last couple of
years.''
	   Nonetheless, he admitted that he thinks ``every day'' what it
might have been like to be champion.
	   ``Not as many people remember second place,'' he said grimly. If
he makes it to the finals again this year, he added, ``I would not
be picky about who I was playing.''
	   One of the first-round leaders, Hank Kuehne came in with a
1-over 71 to join Bob Kearney of Houston and Hunter Haas at
even-par 139.
	   Others expected to qualify were Aaron Baddeley of Australia at
141 and Erik Compton at 143. Compton, 18, the nation's top-ranked
junior golfer, underwent a heart transplant at age 12.
	   Kuchar missed two short putts on two of the last three holes

Graf destroys Nagyova

	   NEW HAVEN, Connecticut (AP) _ Steffi Graf dismantled Henrieta
Nagyova of Slovakia 6-1, 6-3 Tuesday night to advance to the
quarterfinals of the Pilot Pen International women's tournament.
	   Graf, tournament's No. 4 seed and the winner of 21 Grand Slam
singles titles, pounded Nagyova deep with powerful,
sideline-hugging groundstrokes. She won the first set in 20
minutes, breaking the No. 24-ranked Nagyova twice.
	   Nagyova, who had won two tournaments this year and both her Fed
Cup matches against Belgium, could not even capitalize on several
service break opportunities Graf allowed in the second set.
	   Graf, 29, is in the midst of a comeback bid, with the Pilot Pen
her ninth tournament. Ranked 38th in the world, she has reached the
semifinals three times this year.
	   Graf will face the winner of Wednesday's match between Russian
sensation Anna Kournikova and Amanda Coetzer of South Africa.
	   Also Tuesday, sixth-seeded Patty Schnyder of Switzerland used
her impressive forehand to beat Rita Grande of Italy 6-4, 6-3 and
advance to the second round.
	   Schnyder used a combination of precision and power to prevent
the taller Grande, a qualifier, from setting up at the net.
	   ``I think I can still play more aggressive,'' said Schnyder, who
has won five tournaments this year and is ranked No. 10 in the
world.
	   Even with her victories, Schnyder, 19, said she has become used
to staying out of the spotlight now being lavished on the younger,
rising stars of women's tennis.
	   ``I like my life. I wouldn't want to change with them,'' she
said of players such as Martina Hingis and Kournikova. ``Of course,
I would like to play more Center Court ... (so) I think they have
an advantage, but still, I mean, as long as I win my matches it is
all right also.''
	   Schnyder will play Anka Huber, who beat Silvia Farina of Italy,
6-2, 6-3. Huber returned to the tour two weeks ago in Boston
following a four-month rehab after Achille's tendon surgery.
	   In other matches Tuesday, Chanda Rubin beat Elena Likhovtseva of
Russia 3-6, 6-3, 6-1, and qualifier Virginia Ruano-Pascual beat
Anne Miller 6-2, 3-6, 6-2.
	   Rubin, who improved her career record against Likhovtseva to
3-0, will next face Wimbledon champion Jana Novotna, the
tournament's No. 2 seed and the third-ranked player in the world.
	   ``I have to go out and play a solid match _ keep fighting, be
aggressive,'' Rubin said.
	   Ruano-Pascual will face top-seeded Lindsay Davenport in the
second round.

Jones wins 100m, bristles at talk of Arron
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 
 &UR; By GEIR MOULSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ World champion Marion Jones might
have hoped her 100-meter win at the Athletissima Grand Prix on
Tuesday would halt talk of new sprint sensation Christine Arron.
	   But Jones's latest victory in a perfect season has only served
to heighten anticipation of a showdown between the 22-year-old
American and the newly-crowned European champion next Friday at the
Grand Prix in Brussels.
	   ``I'm just looking forward to racing in Brussels and I wish
people would stop talking about Arron,'' said Jones. ``I just wish
everyone would stop asking me about her so much.''
	   ``I've raced her twice and beat her both times,'' Jones added,
saying she wouldn't be adapting her preparations to Arron
specifically.
	   The versatile Jones said she was also looking forward to
encountering warmer weather in Brussels, saying that the cool,
gusty conditions in Lausanne might have slowed her down a bit.
	   Despite the unfavorable temperature, Jones still produced a time
of 10.72 in what she described as one of her best races in Europe.
	   Jones wasn't the only one held back by the conditions.
	   Despite the fact it's one of the fastest tracks in the world,
the nippy conditions prevented any serious attacks on world records
at the Pontaise stadium.
	   Though they each posted wins, crowning a successful evening for
the Americans, world champion Maurice Green and double Olympic gold
medallist Michael Johnson failed to set even the most insignificant
of records.
	   With a top-flight field gathered at the lightning-quick track in
Lausanne, Donovan Bailey's world record of 9.84 was widely expected
to face a stiff challenge.
	   The only notable absentee was the Olympic champion Bailey
himself, still out with a thigh injury sustained in Zurich.
	   However, the temperature combined with two false starts hampered
any attempts to break the barriers.
	   ``The cold and the false starts hurt,'' said Greene's coach John
Smith.
	   Johnson, too, felt the cold.
	   ``It's extremely hot in Dallas right now,'' he said after the
400 meter race, adding that he hadn't wanted to push too hard
against the increasing wind.
	   The conditions helped safeguard Butch Reynolds' 10-year-old
record of 43.29. Two weeks ago it survived Johnson's challenge in
sweltering conditions at Zurich, when he posted a dangerous
season's best of 43.69.
	   But Johnson felt Tuesday's win showed improved form after an
indifferent start to the season.
	   ``I'm actually right now not in as good shape as I was,''
Johnson said. ``I'm just trying to win races now.''
	   Americans took the first three places in the race, with Jerome
Young and Danny McCray coming in behind Johnson to complete the
U.S. clean sweep.
	   Allen Johnson added to the Americans' success, claiming the
men's 110m hurdles in 13.07. He edged European champion Colin
Jackson, who finished second, .02 back.
	   It was a disappointing return to competition for two more of
Britain's European champions.
	   In the triple jump, Jonathan Edwards finished second behind
Germany's Charles Friedek, who won with a jump of 17.07. Edwards
was .07 short. Steve Backley had to settle for third place in the
javelin.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The smoking volcano that towers over Mexico
City briefly shot ash and steam from its 18,000-foot-high crater,
but officials said Tuesday there was no immediate risk to nearby
towns.
	   Small amounts of ``fine and cold ash'' fell Monday afternoon on
Ozumba, 12 miles west of Popocatepetl's crater, according to the
National Center for the Prevention of Disasters, which monitors the
volcano.
	   Popocatepetl also had a smaller eruption before dawn on Tuesday.
But the center's cameras showed only faint amounts of steam
drifting from the crater after daybreak.
	   The mountain is some 30 miles from rural settlements in
southeastern Mexico City and 50 miles from the city center. It has
been active since 1994, regularly emitting gas, steam and ash.
	   ___
	   GUADALAJARA, Mexico (AP) _ Authorities searched Tuesday for a
Jalisco state deputy police chief accused of heading a kidnapping
ring, police said.
	   A state court has issued a warrant for the arrest of Javier Pena
Osorio and eight others for at least three kidnappings, newspapers
reported Tuesday.
	   Two police officers arrested last week reportedly confessed to
kidnapping and implicated Pena, saying he had lent them a police
vehicle for an abduction.
	   ___
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ Alarmed by a run on its cash reserves,
Brazil has eased the rules for foreign capital in hopes of luring
back skittish investors.
	   One change grants tax breaks and other benefits to investors
intending to buy one of the many Brazilian government companies for
sale.
	   Another will allow overseas loans for the Brazilian farm sector
to be fully invested in dollar-linked securities. The rule
previously had restricted such investment to 50 percent.
	   The Central Bank issued the new measures Monday night in the
wake of last week's global financial scare, which sent Brazilian
stock markets plunging and caused the drain on reserves.
	   ___
	   LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) _ A strike Tuesday by workers building the
natural gas pipeline between Santa Cruz, Bolivia, and Sao Paulo,
Brazil, has brought construction to a halt.
	   The 1,800 workers are demanding a bonus of 20 percent of their
current salary and severance pay once their contracts end when the
pipeline is expected to be finished at the end of 1998.
	   The pipeline, the largest project of its kind in Latin America,
will run 1,900 miles from Rio Grande, Bolivia, crossing into Brazil
at Corumba and then branching out to supply the cities of Sao
Paulo, Curitiba and Porto Alegre.
	   ___
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Two men in a disabled motorboat
drifted dangerously close to the Iguazu Falls, surviving 23 hours
in the raging waters clinging to underbrush before a helicopter
rescue, newspapers reported Tuesday.
	   Miguel Aguirre, 25, and Vilmar Rodriguez, 20, were airlifted by
helicopter to safety late Sunday, unharmed despite the shock of
their ordeal.
	   The two men were traveling in a small boat in the brown waters
above Iguazu Falls on Saturday when their motor gave out, the daily
Clarin reported.
	   Approaching the drop, they dove from the boat and grabbed at
tree limbs rising from the water. The two men held on, whistling
and calling for help until their rescue Sunday.
	   The men were taken to a local hospital but had nothing more
serious than mosquito bites and scratches, the La Nacion newspaper
said.
	   The Iguazu Falls are considered some of the world's most
spectacular.
	   ___
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Chile will issue by the end of this year
a 20,000 peso (dlrs 42) bank note, Central Bank President Carlos
Massad said Tuesday.
	   The largest bank note now is the 10,000-peso one.
	   Massad said the new bank note will carry on one side the figure
of Andres Bello, the Venezuelan-born intelectual figure who founded
the University of Chile and wrote Chile's first penal code last
century.
	   On the other side the note will show the facade of the
University of Chile's main building.
	   ___
	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ The Comptroller General's office
reported Tuesday it found evidence of wrongdoing by seven
high-level Nicaraguan officials in allowing a private jet used to
transport drugs to illegally enter the country.
	   The case of the so-called ``narco-jet'' became a national
scandal three months ago following revelations that the plane had
been used to transport government officials, including President
Arnoldo Aleman and Vice President Enrique Bolanos. News reports
said the plane had been stolen from the United States.
	   Aleman, who said he had no knowledge of the plane's history,
ordered an investigation that led to the jailing of civil
aeronautics director Mario Rivas.
	   The Comptroller General's office found evidence that Rivas,
customs director Marco Aurelio Sanchez and five other officials
bore ``penal and administrative responsiblity'' in the case. It
passed its findings along to a criminal court judge and the
attorney general's office, which will consider whether to file
charges.

UN inspectors waiting, giving council information
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ U.N. weapons inspectors are waiting for
more instructions from the Security Council before deciding how and
when they'll try to search for banned weapons in the face of Iraq's
decision to stop cooperation, the chief inspector said.
	   In the meantime, Richard Butler said he would amplify his
previous reports about Iraq's abilities to produce the deadly nerve
agent VX and its chemical munitions. Some council members had
requested more details before deciding how to respond to Iraq's
decision.
	   ``It's best if we sit on the bench and give them information as
required,'' Butler said Tuesday in an interview with The Associated
Press. ``It's best for us to await further deliberation by and
guidance from the Security Council.''
	   His comments indicated that any test of Iraq's resolve to
enforce its Aug. 5 decision to freeze cooperation with inspectors
was not imminent _ though as a rule, inspectors wouldn't announce a
search anyway.
	   But Butler's statements also indicate that inspectors seemingly
don't want to provoke a possible confrontation with Iraq without
more backing from the council, which has been unusually muted in
its response.
	   Council members more sympathetic to Baghdad could accuse
inspectors of looking for a fight while the council was working on
a diplomatic solution.
	   Weapons experts must certify that Iraq has destroyed its
long-range missiles and biological, chemical and nuclear weapons
before the council will lift sanctions imposed after Baghdad
invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   Baghdad froze cooperation after Butler refused to certify Iraqi
compliance. The move paralyzed inspections since inspectors can't
conduct searches without Iraqi escorts.
	   The council has only said Baghdad's decision was ``totally
unacceptable,'' and urged inspectors try to do their work _ a move
that some criticized as passing the responsibility onto inspectors.
	   Butler asked that cooperation resume in a letter last week to
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz. Aziz rejected the request.
	   ``When Aziz answered `we will not cooperate,' he did deliver the
ball back to the Security Council side of the court,'' Butler said.
	   The United States and Britain are seeking to have regular
reviews on sanctions suspended until Baghdad resumes cooperation. A
draft resolution was expected this week.
	   Butler rejected Iraq's demand that the special commission be
reconfigured and suggestions that he be replaced. Iraq says
Washington has too much influence over UNSCOM and is manipulating
it and Butler to maintain sanctions.
	   ``The latest call was because I will not agree to wave a magic
wand over Iraq's weapons program,'' he said. ``Were I to do that,
that would be a reason for someone to say `he should go.'''

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ During a visit to China next month, the
top U.N. human rights official plans to bring up the administration
of justice, labor rights, women's rights and minority rights, the
United Nations said Tuesday.
	   The high commissioner for human rights, Mary Robinson, is
scheduled to visit the country from Sept. 7-15, U.N. spokesman Fred
Eckhard said.
	   China's rights record, including suppression of political
dissent, has been widely criticized by private human rights groups.
	   In March, Robinson _ the former Irish President _ said her goal
in the visit is to work with the government to improve protection
of human rights.
	   ``It will not mean that serious problems are not there or that
serious problems will suddenly disappear. Of course, not,'' she
said.

Draft: Libya sanctions suspended once suspects appear for trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous; UPDATES with Libyan letter sent in January
with similar proposals. &QL; 
 &UR; By SAU CHAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council was considering a
draft resolution that would suspend U.N. sanctions against Libya as
soon as two Libyan suspects in the 1988 Pan Am bombing arrive in
the Netherlands for trial.
	   The council was expected to continue discussions on the
U.S.-British proposal Wednesday, and could adopt the resolution
before the week is out.
	   According to the draft, the council would consider additional
sanctions if Libya doesn't promptly turn over Abdel Basset
al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah for trial. U.S. lawmakers have
in the past urged an international oil embargo on Libya, an OPEC
member.
	   Current sanctions include an air embargo and curbs on arms sales
and on certain financial and travel activities.
	   The draft circulated Tuesday as the council began preliminary
consultations on a deal to try the two suspects in the Netherlands
using Scottish judges and Scottish law.
	   U.S. and British officials announced their proposal Monday in a
bid to end a 10-year impasse over the Pan Am bombing, which killed
259 people aboard Pan Am Flight 103 and 11 people on the ground at
Lockerbie, Scotland.
	   The council must endorse the deal because previous U.N.
resolutions stipulated that the trial take place only in the United
States or the United Kingdom.
	   Libya has refused to turn over the two suspects, fearing they
would not get a fair trial in either country.
	   In a letter in January to the Security Council, Libyan Foreign
Minister Omar al-Muntasser said his government would agree to a
trial by Scottish judges in accordance with Scottish law. He
specified that the trial should be at the International Court of
Justice at The Hague, in the Netherlands.
	   The U.S.-British deal makes no mention of The Hague, saying only
that the trial would be in The Netherlands.
	   Deputy U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh said Tuesday that he hoped
the council would take action on the resolution in ``the next day
or two.''
	   ``So we are expecting that Libya will agree with this process
and very promptly produce the two accused after the council adopts
the resolution,'' Burleigh said.
	   Libya's government-run television said Tuesday that experts and
officials were meeting to discuss the proposals and ``a detailed
statement about this will be issued ... Wednesday.''
	   On Tuesday, the head of the Arab League, Esmat Abdel Meguid,
said Libya would probably accept the deal because it was
``compatible with previous suggestions, which Libya has accepted.''
	   Council president Danilo Turk of Slovenia said ``a very large
number of members'' of the 15-member council wished quick action on
the resolution.
	   The resolution also says that sanctions will only be suspended
once Libya satisfies a French investigation into the bombing of UTA
flight 772, which exploded over the Niger desert on Sept. 19, 1989,
killing all of 170 the passengers and crew.
	   The council, however, was not making any new Libyan cooperation
a condition of the sanctions suspension, a U.S. official said.
	   In January, France's top terrorism judge named six suspects _
including Libyan leader Moammar Ghadafi's brother-in-law _ in the
explosion. Judge Jean-Louis Brugiere last year said Libyan
officials gave cooperation in his investigation that ``satisfied
most of the French demands.''

On Kosovo's border, Albanian farmers defend crops with guns
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PADESH, Albania (AP) _ Farmer Hasan Padesh proudly speculates
that he owns the most dangerous potato field in Albania.
	   ``If the Serbs want to come (into Albania), they have to take my
farm first,'' said Padesh, 25, ducking the line of fire of
mountaintop Serb snipers and glorying in his new possessions _ two
machine guns and a rocket launcher.
	   Padesh lives 100 meters (yards) from the border with Serbia's
war-torn southern province of Kosovo. His rocky field and stone
home are caught between Yugoslav soldiers in their country and
separatist ethnic Albanian rebels from Kosovo who use Albanian soil
to train recruits and plan attacks.
	   The plight of the three dozen farmers and shepherds who toil on
the lush green mountainsides around Padesh reflects heightened
tension along the border _ a worsening danger spot for Albanians
and Kosovo refugees alike.
	   The farmers have spent much of their meager savings on military
weapons in the last two months, reflecting their fear of Yugoslav
army incursions on Albanian territory.
	   ``We are scared,'' said Fatima Padesh, a 47-year-old mother of
six who, like other residents, takes her last name from the
village. ``There are snipers in the hills. There are women and
children here.''
	   Padesh said she twice fled to a nearby town in the previous 12
days to escape machine-gun fire targeting the armed men of her
village.
	   The latest fight, she said, came Thursday when Yugoslav soldiers
fired machine guns and mortars at 70 refugees who crossed the
border from Kosovo into Padesh.
	   Men from Padesh rushed to Hasan Padesh's potato farm and fired
back until the refugees were able to flee uninjured, she said.
	   The cross-border clashes, often including Albanian farmers and
shepherds, have sparked loud protest from the government of
Albania. Serb-led Yugoslavia, meanwhile, complains that Albania
harbors the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army, giving it crucial
refuge from a Serb onslaught.
	   Most of the combat in the KLA's fight for independence for the
predominantly ethnic Albanian province has centered on Kosovo
itself. But the Serb offensive that started in July drove hundreds
or thousands of rebels across the border into Albania and border
clashes will increase, guerrillas say.
	   Although the KLA and Albanian farmers say the Yugoslav soldiers
haven't advanced onto Albanian soil, they expect an incursion as
the army grows frustrated with the KLA's ability to rapidly flee
over the border.
	   The fighting also increases the danger for the refugees
streaming across the border from fighting in Kosovo.
	   The refugees, who number about 7,000 in the northern towns of
Tropoja and Bajram Curri, regularly complain that Serb security
forces shoot at them as they flee.
	   Bill Foxton, head of an international observer mission that
patrols the border, said the recent Serb advances will only worsen
the problem in coming weeks as thousands of displaced Kosovo
residents finally cross into Albania.
	   ``We only see the refugees here a few weeks after the
fighting,'' said Foxton. ``They wait as long as they can in Kosovo
and come here only when they think they have no more hope.''
	   A KLA junior officer who commands a small camp of new recruits
at the border predicts heavy fighting will intensify in coming
weeks as he and his comrades launch an offensive to clear a route
for smuggling arms and guerrillas into Kosovo.
	   The officer, who uses the code name Noti, or Swimmer, said the
KLA has begun patrolling the border to prevent the Yugoslav army,
which has reportedly placed land mines in the area, from cutting
them off from their homeland.

Security Council: Cooperation must resume on peace accord
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The secretary-general's personal envoy
briefed the Security Council about his trip to Angola, where
fighting threatens a U.N.-brokered peace accord.
	   Lakhdar Brahimi made no comment on Tuesday. Danilo Turk of
Slovenia, the council president, expressed ``grave concern'' over
the lack of progress for a peaceful settlement and outbreaks of
renewed fighting in the former Portuguese colony.
	   ``The members of the Security Council no longer find acceptable
further setbacks or procrastination in the peace process under any
pretext,'' said Turk who reiterated that the former rebel movement
UNITA was to blame.
	   Meantime, a civil war in neighboring Congo appears to further
threaten the fragile stability in southwest Africa.
	   The Angolan government, which fought a two-decade civil war
against UNITA before the 1994 U.N. peace accord, is providing
military support for Congolese President Laurent Kabila against a
coalition of ethnic Tutsi gunmen and disenchanted members of
Kabila's military.
	   In a statement Tuesday faxed to The Associated Press in Lisbon,
UNITA said it also had interests to defend in Congo but stopped
short of openly acknowledging support for the rebels.
	   ``UNITA cannot accept, for any reason, Angola's military
intervention'' in Congo, according to the statement by UNITA _ a
Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola. ``If (the Angolan government) feels it has
interests to defend in the region, then let it be known that UNITA
also has.''
	   A UNITA representative in Lisbon said his movement could not
provide military support because it demobilized all its troops as
part of the peace accord.
	   However, the Angolan government claims UNITA has some 25,000
troops hidden away.
	   Angola's entry into Congo's civil war may be driven by
government concerns that Kabila's departure could usher in a new
administration sympathetic to UNITA.
	   Angola last year helped Kabila oust President Mobutu Sese Seko,
the long-time ruler of then-Zaire and an ally of UNITA leader Jonas
Savimbi.
	   In return, Kabila agreed to cut off UNITA's supply lines between
the two countries that allowed UNITA to smuggle out diamonds and
bring in military equipment, according to the government.
	   Brahimi visited Angola several weeks ago in an effort to defuse
tensions. The Security Council also recently extended the stay of
U.N. military observers in Angola until Sept. 15.

Dollar lower, Tokyo stock prices slip in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar moved lower against the Japanese
yen in light trading early Wednesday, while Tokyo stock prices
slipped.
	   The dollar bought 144.41 yen, down 0.35 yen from late Tuesday in
Tokyo but above its late New York rate of 144.21 yen overnight.
	   Traders saw some yen-buying from domestic investment trust
funds, but selling pressure by U.S. Institutional investors
continued to weigh on the Japanese currency amid a lack of market
moving news.
	   The yen had gained earlier in the week on persistent fears
Japanese authorities would intervene in markets to support their
currency.
	   While caution over possible yen-supportive intervention was
still a factor, dealers said the dollar remains well-supported on
the downside.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, where quiet trading also prevailed,
share prices moved lower amid concerns about moves to clean up
Japan's bad loan mess.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 8.59 points, or 0.06
percent, to 15,064.34 points in the first 30 minutes of trading. On
Tuesday, the average closed up 84.57 points, or 0.56 percent.
	   ``Fear that steps to stabilize the banking system will be
delayed is hurting the market's mood,'' said Sachio Ishikawa,
general manager of the stock division at Chuo Securities.
	   Traders are concerned a series of bills aimed at cleaning up the
massive bad loan problems at Japanese banks may fail to pass
Parliament.
	   Debate on the six bills began Tuesday, but smooth passage is
doubtful as opposition parties have said they oppose the use of
public funds to bail out banks.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 1.36 points, or 0.12 percent, to 1,161.22
points. The TOPIX closed up 4.28 points, or 0.37 percent, the day
before.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 1.115 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.125 percent,
driving its price up to 112.32 yen from 112.26 yen.

Jamaican death row convict gets 10-day stay of execution
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ A murder convict scheduled to be hanged
in Jamaica Thursday lost his court bid to escape his death sentence
but won a 10-day postponement while he appeals the decision.
	   Justice Clarence Walker ruled against Neville Lewis's complaint
that his execution is unconstitutional, but allowed him 10 days to
take the decision to the Jamaican Court of Appeal.
	   Lewis, 32, was convicted in 1994 of strangling Vic Higgs, 59, a
businessman and golf consultant, in October 1992. Higgs' body was
found weighted with iron in a muddy lake.
	   Lewis was to be hanged on the gallows of the St. Catherine
District Prison in Jamaica's first execution since February 1988.
	   Lewis' lawyers had wanted the hanging postponed until his case
is reviewed by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, an
international advisory body. The commission has said it would hear
the case during a session that begins September 28.
	   Jamaica has accused the commission of delaying death row cases
and plans to drop out of the international body.

UNICEF says incidence of malnourished children declining
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The incidence of malnourished children in
North Korea appears to be declining in some areas, the U.N.
Children's Fund said Tuesday.
	   The assessment _ which UNICEF cautioned couldn't be verified
statistically _ comes after renewed concern about the country's
famine following a visit earlier this month by a U.S. delegation.
	   With video showing stick-thin children, the delegation reported
that three years of famine had killed up to 2 million people and
that people were eating weeds to stay alive.
	   Nevertheless, hospital records generally indicate reductions in
fatalities and improvements in the rehabilitation of patients,
UNICEF said in a statement.
	   At one baby home in Ryanggang province, only 14 out of 319
children were found to be severely malnourished in July. In
February of this year, 26 of 227 children were in the same state,
UNICEF said.
	   Higher rates were reported at a home in Chongjin, in the
province that borders China and Russia. There, out of 300 children,
20 percent were found to be malnourished, 10 percent severely.
	   Though the information cannot be statistically verified, the
incidence of malnourished children appears to be declining and the
situation has improved in accessible areas, the statement said.
	   UNICEF currently delivers drugs, medical equipment and water to
an estimated 4.6 million people, including 500,000 children under
5.

Officials concerned about humantarian situation in Congo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ U.N. officials expressed ``great concern''
for civilians in Congo where rebels in a 3-week-old civil war have
cut power and water to the capital of Kinsasha.
	   ``It's very difficult .... We have expressed great concern about
this. We think that they're deliberately cutting water off to the
capital city, which causes enormous suffering to the ordinary
population. It is a wrong thing to do and that should be reversed
immediately.'' said Kieran Prendergast, undersecretary-general for
political affairs.
	   In Geneva, the UNHCR said Tuesday that refugees fleeing Congo
are still arriving in nearby Tanzania and crossing in smaller
numbers to neighboring Congo-Brazzaville.
	   The Security Council is following the situation closely,
Prendergast said. ``They're pondering what steps to take,'' he
said.
	   Council president, Danilo Turk of Slovenia, said there is
``grave concern'' about Congo and informal talks have in going on.
But the 15-member panel has decided in the meantime to allow
countries in that area to deal with the problem.
	   ``There is certain diplomatic activity going on,'' he said.
	   ``There were ideas that the situation may require a more formal
engagement of the council,'' he said. ``But no specific proposal
was made at this point as to when and how.''

Sydney wakes up to another water contamination scare
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL;

 &UR; By ROHAN SULLIVAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ For the second time in a month, Sydney
residents Wednesday awoke to warnings that the tap water in the
city that will host the 2000 Olympics is unfit to drink.
	   In a city that considers itself one of the world's most modern
and urbane, water fountains in school playgrounds were shut down
and signs put up in office blocks warning people not to drink the
water unless it had been boiled for at least one minute.
	   The warning was issued by the New South Wales state Health
Department, which said testing in the past two days found that high
levels of the dangerous microscopic parasites giardia and
cyptosporidium had reappeared in the city's water system.
	   The warning went out to almost all of Sydney's suburbs, and
applies to the vast majority of Sydney 3.7 million residents.
	   Residents should boil water before drinking, cleaning teeth,
gargling, washing uncooked foods such as salads and making ice, the
department said. Schoolchildren should take bottled water to
school.
	   The outbreak is the second water contamination scare within four
weeks. For more than a week from late July, Sydney residents were
instructed to boil their water or risk serious illness from the
parasites.
	   Giardia, normally spread through human or animal fecal matter,
can cause diarrhea and other gastrointestinal problems.
Cryptosporidium is spread in similar fashion. It causes flu-like
symptoms and can kill people with weak immune systems, including
the very young and the elderly.
	   The outbreak caused severe embarrassment for Australia's largest
city, as the international spotlight intensifies in the lead-up to
the Olympics. The earlier scare also came the day U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright and Defense Secretary William Cohen
attended top level meetings in the city.
	   State Health Department Director-General Mick Reid on Wednesday
said the latest test results indicated the levels of
cryptosporidium were higher this time than during the previous
scare.
	   ``I'm terribly concerned. This is a major decision to advise a
large component of Sydney residents to boil their water. This is
not an issue which is attractive to anyone,'' Reid told Australian
Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   He said heavy rainfall in the Sydney catchment area in recent
weeks may be responsible for the contamination.
	   ``Sydney has experienced unprecedented rainfall over the last
month, and our dams are full and that may have contributed to it,''
he said.
	   Cryptosporidium got into the water supply of Milwaukee, Wis., in
1993, killing about 100 people. More than 400,000 others were
sickened.
	   No cases of illness were reported after the earlier Sydney
outbreak.
	   An inquiry is still underway into its cause. Theories include
that dead dogs found in waterways leading to a water treatment
plant contaminated the system.
	   The plant was cleaned up and the city's water system flushed
with clean water. An Australian dollars 35 million (U.S. dlrs 21
million) upgrade of the city's water supply was announced.
	   Two senior executives of Sydney Water have resigned from the
utility since the previous scare.

Police shoot gunman who kidnaps woman, crashes car
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand (AP) _ A gunman believed to be high on
drugs and who took a woman hostage was shot and seriously wounded
by police Wednesday after he crashed her car near the police
station, police said.
	   The 20-year-old gunman was wounded in the chest, stomach and hip
after police challenged him to put down his shotgun in the road
outside the station.
	   The incident comes just one day after the government announced
new nationwide gun control measures, but did not adopt proposals to
buy back weapons or ban military-style semi-automatics.
	   The woman hostage, whom the gunman snatched still in her
nightdress from an inner-city house, escaped from the car while the
gunman was driving through the city's landmark Cathedral Square.
	   Two blocks further on, he rammed a passing vehicle outside the
police station. Out of the car, he wandered the street,
alternatively pointing his shotgun at passers-by and at the nearby
police building entrance.
	   The armed man did not know the woman and his motives for taking
her was still unknown, Detective Superintendent Jim Millar said.
	   ``Armed police cordons were in the process of being established
when the man was called on to lay down his weapon. He was
challenged several times,'' Millar said. Police then shot him, he
said.
	   The gunman was in critical condition in Christchurch Hospital
after surgery for his gunshot wounds.

Last defendant tried for street kid slayings found guilty
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALEX DUFF
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ The last defendant in a crime that
has come to symbolize police brutality in Latin America's biggest
country, was found guilty on Tuesday of being one of the killers in
the 1993 murder of eight street kids in downtown Rio.
	   Marcos Aurelio Dias Alcantara, a former Rio de Janeiro state
policeman, was sentenced to 204 years in jail - 18 years for each
of the eight killings and 12 years for five attempted murders. But
under Brazilian law he cannot serve more than 30 years.
	   Since none of the individual sentences was for 20 years or more,
he will not be entitled to the automatic retrial stipulated in
Brazilian law.
	   Dias, who recanted a 1996 confession and pleaded innocent to all
the charges, refused to answer questions during the two-day trial,
claiming his right to remain silent.
	   His attorney, Alberto Louvera said his client has been
``psychologically coerced into confessing.''
	   Dias, 30, showed no emotion when he heard the verdict and the
sentences and kept his head bowed as he was taken away by 10 police
officers.
	   He was the sixth defendant to stand trial for the 1993 killings.
One ex-policeman officer has been found guilty and another
convicted of attempted murder. Three defendants were acquitted, and
another was killed before coming to trial.
	   The only other policeman convicted of the murders, Marcus
Vinicius Emmanuel, drew a 309-year sentence that later was reduced
to 89 years at his retrial. Nelson Oliveira dos Santos Cunha,
originally sentenced to 261 years for the eight murders, was
acquitted at his retrial and his sentence reduced to 18 years for
one charge of attempted murder.
	   Prosecutors said Dias was among the gunmen who attacked dozens
of children sleeping on the sidewalk near Candelaria Cathedral on
July 23, 1993. Six were killed on the spot, and two others were
driven to the waterfront and killed.
	   Louvera said no one is sure who did the shooting and that
``there is still a lot of doubt surrounding this case.'' He said he
would appeal.
	   For Gloria Marcia Percinoto, the verdict will help restore
``people's confidence in Rio de Janeiro's justice system.''
	   ``We have acted against an horrific crime that shocked Brazil
and the entire world,'' she said.
	   Laurette von Mandach, an Amnesty International observer at the
trial said: ``This is is an important step against impunity.
	   A survivor, Wagner dos Santos, identified the policemen as the
shooters. He now lives in Switzerland for his protection and was
not present at the trial.
	   Santos' accusations confirmed what many Brazilians suspected.
Rights defenders say shopkeepers in high-crime districts routinely
pay policemen to kill children suspected of stealing.
	   An estimated 2,000 to 3,000 children, most of them homeless or
runaways, live on the streets of this city of 6 million.

Reports: Abu Nidal detained in Egypt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Egyptian officials have detained Palestinian
terrorist mastermind Abu Nidal, who was apparently caught after
crossing the border from Libya, according to U.S. news reports.
	   It was the second time in two weeks that a series of reports
said the Palestinian was being held. There was no immediate
response from the Egyptian government, which had denied the earlier
reports.
	   The Los Angeles Times, citing U.S. officials, reported Tuesday
that the one-time Palestinian guerrilla was apprehended by Egypt
but that Washington officials had few details. CBS Evening News
also reported that Abu Nidal is in custody in Egypt, attributing
the information to U.S. officials.
	   ABC News quoted Egyptian government sources as saying that Abu
Nidal is receiving medical treatment in Egypt. But it quoted other
sources as saying that Egypt had, in fact, arrested Abu Nidal.
	   The State Department's intelligence and counterterrorism offices
could not confirm reports of Abu Nidal's arrest. ``We just don't
know,'' a U.S. official said.
	   Speaking on condition of anonymity, the official noted that a
similar report had circulated in Cairo earlier this month, and
Egyptian security officials denied there was an arrest then.
	   Justice Department officials in Washington say there are no U.S.
charges, warrants or even sealed indictments against Abu Nidal.
They did note that he is wanted in Italy.
	   Abu Nidal _ the nom de guerre of Sabri al-Banna _ has operated
from Iraq, Syria and Libya. His group has been blamed for terrorist
attacks in Europe and the Middle East.
	   The U.S. State Department lists his group as ``the most
dangerous terrorist organization in existence,'' blamed for killing
300 people and wounding 650 in 20 countries since 1973.

Receiver sought for West Edmonton Mall
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Dollar amounts are in Canadian dollars
 &UR; By The Associated Press

<TEXT>
	   EDMONTON (AP) _ Alberta Treasury Branches has asked the courts
to appoint a receiver-manager for West Edmonton Mall, alleging its
business practices ``offend the ordinary standards of morality and
decent conduct.''
	   Treasury Branches, a bank owned by the Alberta government, filed
a 25-page statement of claim in court Tuesday.
	   It alleges the mega-mall defaulted on a loan package totalling
$440 million by not properly maintaining the property and refusing
to let the bank examine its books.
	   The suit claims the mall owners, the Ghermezian family, bribed
former ATB superintendent Elmer Leahy to refinance the mall's debts
at terms that were ``contrary to all prudent lending principles and
practice.''

 &UR; Number of departing doctors declines
	   OTTAWA (AP) _ The exodus of Canadian physicians to the United
States slowed in 1997 while the number of physicians returning to
Canada from abroad increased.
	   Figures released Tuesday by the Canadian Institute for Health
Information show there were 659 physicians who moved abroad last
year, down 10 per cent from 1996.
	   Meanwhile, 227 Canadian doctors returned from abroad, up from
218 in 1996. The result for the year is a net loss of 441, down
from 513 the previous year.
	   ``I think it's too soon to call it a turnaround,'' Judith
Dowler, a spokeswoman for the institute, said in an interview. ``I
see it more as a levelling out.''

 &UR; Air Canada pilots set strike date
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ Pilots at Canada's largest air carrier have set
a strike deadline of midnight Sept. 1.
	   The deadline was announced after the Air Canada Pilots
Association and Air Canada left conciliation talks late Tuesday.
	   Under the Canada Labor Code, the pilots will be in a legal
position to strike in seven days. They are seeking to secure a
contract with improved wages and working conditions.
	   The dispute between Air Canada and its 2,100 pilots had been in
the hands of federal Labor Minister Lawrence MacAulay. Talks broke
off last week.
	   Both parties have agreed to begin a last-minute mediation
effort, tentatively scheduled to start Aug. 27.

 &UR; Small business says no to bank mergers
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ Small Canadian entrepreneurs, who often complain
about being badly treated by big banks, are starting a campaign to
halt proposed bank mergers.
	   The Canadian Federation of Independent Business believes the
mergers will make it even harder for small firms to get loans and
will raise their fees.
	   The organization released results of a poll Tuesday suggesting
68.4 per cent of its 89,000 members were against the proposed
mergers of four banks into two huge banks, while 20 per cent were
in favor. About 11,700 members responded to the survey this summer.

 &UR; Province seizes logging truck
	   BIG COVE, New Brunswick (AP) _ A loaded logging truck was seized
near the Big Cove reserve Tuesday as New Brunswick renewed efforts
to halt illegal cutting on Crown land.
	   The seizure was the first in several weeks and Natural Resources
Minister Doug Tyler said it was done because of a dramatic increase
in illegal logging.
	   He said what began as a few rogue crews cutting about 50 cords a
week got out of control recently when non-native woodsworkers
started moving in skidders and other harvesting equipment.

Divorce rising as Taiwanese women rebel against overbearing males
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY303 &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNIE HUANG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ He was a typical Taiwanese husband, his
embittered wife said. He spent her money, dined out every night and
left her alone with the kids.
	   ``He treated his buddies like his own blood and muscle and his
wife as if she was just a piece of clothing,'' said Ho Tse-suan.
	   Ho, a 43-year-old accountant, chose what was once a rare
solution to this common complaint. Despite courts that still favor
men when it comes to property and child custody, she chose divorce.
	   Until recently, divorce was hardly an option for women in
Taiwan. In traditional Chinese societies, only men could disown
their wives _ for adultery or failure to give birth to male heirs.
Divorced women were outcasts who spent the rest of their lives in
disgrace, if not poverty.
	   But as Taiwanese women gain education, economic clout and the
self-confidence from taking part in their land's economic boom, the
stigma is fading. Increasingly, women are opting for divorce
instead of staying with men who are abusive or have affairs.
	   Twenty years ago, just one in 17 marriages in Taiwan ended in
divorce. Now the figure is one of the highest in Asia _ one divorce
for every 4.3 marriages. Women like Ho are even going on a popular
TV show called ``True Love'' to warn their younger sisters about
the pitfalls of marriage _ and to search for new spouses.
	   While there are no statistics on the gender of who initiates
divorces, women are noticeably taking action. Lee Hsiu-yen, a
divorce counselor, estimates about 40 percent of divorces are now
filed by women. Almost none were 20 years ago.
	   Economic independence has done more than anything else to raise
the status of women, said Wang Yu-pao, a member of the feminist
group Women's Awakening.
	   Taiwanese women account for 40 percent of the work force and on
average earn about 70 percent of what a man does. That's below
Western standards, but much higher than the Asian average of 30
percent.
	   Wang said most women who seek divorce do so as a last resort.
``Many divorced after having tolerated their husbands' physical
abuses or affairs for 20 or 30 years,'' she said.
	   Some men are feeling threatened.
	   ``Women are a lot different today. They have stronger will,''
said Chou Ching-chun, a 52-year-old salesman.
	   He chuckled and added that he ``dared not oppose'' the changes.
But he looks back fondly on the days when ``men's words were
absolute, and women listened.''
	   Men do have options, though.
	   There are plenty of culturally conservative women. Hsu Ying, an
economics professor at Chunghsing University, said some still abort
girl fetuses, preferring boys to carry the family name and deny
their husbands excuses for a divorce.
	   Prospective husbands are also benefiting from increasing
business and personal contacts with mainland China. While the
communist revolution guaranteed equality of the sexes there, many
mainland women are willing to give it up to marry a prosperous
Taiwanese.
	   Ho Mei-shiang, a producer of ``True Love,'' said fewer men sign
up for the TV program because they can remarry more easily, are
less likely to sit still for criticism and are reluctant to share
their experience.
	   However, women are eager to tell their stories so others don't
make the same mistakes.
	   Attorney Chi Kuan-ling said judges are predominantly male, and
even though old laws favoring men have been abolished, they are
inclined to give the custody of children to fathers.
	   Ho Tse-suan, for instance, lost custody of her two young
children in her divorce four years ago. She got them back only
after her former husband died in a car crash.
	   Fu Tse-yan, an embarrassed 35-year-old, said she and her husband
hastily got married after having sex. For her, it meant
respectability. For him, it meant taking responsibility.
	   Feminist Shih Chi-ching told Fu on the program that there are
women who marry men who rape them because they fear no one else
will want them.
	   ``Virginity is not a matter of morality, as it would seem,''
Shih said. ``To women, it's merchandise that could gain them
husbands, and for men it's a means to control women.''

What would an impeachment report from Starr look like?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; An AP News Analysis &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN SOLOMON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Congressional leaders awaiting the
prosecutors' report on the Monica Lewinsky inquiry are likely to
receive seven months of evidence woven into a narrative alleging
perjury and obstruction of justice _ and possibly abuse of
presidential power.
	   Every sensational detail that emerged in the breathless early
days of the controversy _ the stained dress, the gifts, the
contacts with witnesses _ will be analyzed in the fresh light of
President Bill Clinton's admission he had an improper relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky.
	   Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's report will be ``an
avalanche of facts'' that will provide a sharp contrast with the
more general answers Clinton has given in public, said Stephen
Gillers, a New York University law professor.
	   ``I imagine this report will be a relentless, redundant
recitation of details that simply make it impossible for the
president to finesse his way out'' with vague replies, Gillers
said.
	   Every explanation Clinton or his supporters have given will be
compared to the testimony and evidence gathered in secret since
late January by prosecutors and the grand jury.
	   Early on, the White House said the president was simply
refreshing his recollection when he summoned Oval Office Secretary
Betty Currie to his office on the Sunday after he denied under oath
in the Paula Jones lawsuit that he had sex with Ms. Lewinsky. In
that testimony, the president also used Mrs. Currie to explain the
former intern's many visits to the White House.
	   Now that Clinton has acknowledged his denial was misleading,
prosecutors could conclude the meeting was an attempt to sway Mrs.
Currie, a potential witness.
	   Clinton's late December meeting in the White House with Ms.
Lewinsky, after she was subpoenaed in the Jones lawsuit, provides a
similar situation. That's because prosecutors have evidence that
Clinton suggested Ms. Lewinsky could file an affidavit to try to
get out of the testimony and wouldn't have to turn over
presidential gifts as evidence if she didn't have them.
	   The former White House intern followed through with an affidavit
in which she falsely claimed she did not have a sexual relationship
with the president, and she gave the gifts to Clinton's secretary.
	   Early on, presidential aides dismissed the gifts as trivial. Now
they are the focal point of a possible obstruction of justice case.
Prosecutors are investigating whether Clinton was behind their
transfer to Mrs. Currie in an effort to keep them from becoming
evidence.
	   Early in the case, as well, the White House said its legal
battles over executive privilege, attorney-client privilege and
Secret Service testimony _ were about protecting principles _ not
keeping government lawyers and agents from giving testimony that
could hurt the president.
	   Now prosecutors have the option of including in their report a
chapter entitled ``Abuse of Presidential Power'' that would argue
Clinton misused his office to have a relationship with an intern
and then used government resources to sustain a denial for seven
months that he knew to be untrue.
	   Such a report could cite the use of government lawyers to pose
roadblocks or the use of a government secretary to retrieve gifts
as potential evidence.
	   Prosecutors may have another weapon in their report _ Clinton's
own words. In his sworn deposition in January, Clinton not only
denied sexual relations based on the Jones definition, he affirmed
a statement in Ms. Lewinsky's own false affidavit that the two did
not have a sexual relationship.
	   ``Is that a true and accurate statement as far as you know it?''
Clinton lawyer Robert Bennett asked the president after reading
from Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit.
	   ``That is absolutely true,'' Clinton answered. That was under
oath. Seven months later, the president has changed course in the
face of the evidence.

Red Sea winds will be blowing power across Egypt

<TEXT>
	   HURGHADA, Egypt (AP) _ European tourists step out of their
planes expecting to see the turquoise water, rainbow fish and
olive-green coral that make this Red Sea resort famous.
	   Instead, their first sight as they head for hotels is a
throwback to home: windmills. It's a wind farm with 40 high-tech
windmills set on the desert in neat rows, their 10-meter (33-foot)
blades ceaselessly spinning in the relentless breeze.
	   As wind farms go, Hurghada's isn't particularly impressive. Some
windmills have three blades, others two. Some are too close to
houses.
	   But the Egyptians have impressive hopes for this project. It is
the pilot stage of a program aimed at making Egypt the No. 1
generator of wind power in Africa and the Middle East within two
years.
	   Experts say this coast is among the world's best sites for
turning wind into electricity. The winds blowing across northern
Egypt from the Mediterranean are accelerated by the high mountains
along the Red Sea _ in the same way that if you squeeze a hose, the
water velocity increases.
	   Moreover, the wind is remarkably constant.
	   At places it averages more than 36 kph (23 mph) for 95 percent
of the year. Some of the biggest European and American wind farms
are sited where the average speed is 25 kph (16 mph).
	   Egypt's extra velocity is worth more than it seems. Because the
electricity generated varies exponentially with speed, that extra
11 kph (7 mph) delivers almost a threefold increase in power.
	   ``We are talking about ideal conditions,'' says Amr Serag el
Din, professor of mechanical engineering at the American University
in Cairo.
	   The proof is in the price. At Zafarana, the Red Sea village
where the project is to be built, windmills are expected to
generate power for 4 U.S. cents per kilowatt-hour. That is
one-third the average cost in Germany, the world's biggest
generator of wind power.
	   The one environmental risk is to birds. About a dozen species,
including white storks and steppe eagles, migrate in the thousands
down the Red Sea corridor.
	   Richard Hoath, an ornithologist, says the threat is relatively
minor because the birds fly 40 meters (about 125 feet) above the
planned windmills. But he says there should be no adjacent sewage
plants or rubbish dumps that could draw the birds down into the
path of the blades.
	   Egypt began looking at wind in 1986. It wanted to reduce the
pollution produced from its natural gas- and diesel-fired power
stations. The state's New and Renewable Energy Authority began
mapping winds across the country.
	   The readings from Hurghada were high. Then experts from DANIDA,
the aid agency of Denmark - builder of the first wind farm in the
1890s and now the leading manufacturer of wind turbines _
discovered even higher wind speeds at Zafarana.
	   Egypt's government set aside 80 square kilometers (32 square
miles) of desert at Zafarana. Construction is to begin in December
on Danish- and German-financed wind farms.
	   By the end of 2000, the farms should be generating 90 megawatts,
enough to power a town of 15,000 people. That is 10 times the
output of Iran, now the biggest wind power generator in Africa and
the Middle East.
	   The renewable energy authority is negotiating with other
countries about sponsoring wind farms and talking to foreign
companies interested in building and running the farms for a
profit.
	   Its vice chairman, Mohammed Aref el-Qarmalawy, hopes that
windmills will be generating 600 megawatts by 2005 _ about 3
percent of Egypt's needs. By today's standards, that would make
Egypt the world's fifth biggest producer of wind power, behind
Germany, 2,080 megawatts; the United States, 1,600 megawatts;
Denmark, 1,120 megawatts; and India, 950 megawatts.
	   The goal may be over ambitious, but Egypt has the potential.
Serag el Din says a study found that if wind farms were built along
a 250-kilometer (150-mile) stretch of the Red Sea, they could
produce ``more energy than the whole of Egypt needs.''
	   He stresses no country would rely entirely on wind because it
even along the Red Sea it does die down at times. But Egypt could
sell excess power from wind farms to other countries.
	   Within two years Egypt is to be connected to Europe via a series
of linked national electricity grids across North Africa and over
to Spain.
	   There may come a day when tourists driving beside the Red Sea
find themselves staring at the source of some of the power they
consume back home.

Blair vows ``no more Omaghs'' as he plans tougher anti-terror laws
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OMAGH, Northern Ireland (AP) _ British Prime Minister Tony Blair
has promised new ``draconian and fundamental'' anti-terrorist laws,
saying they are necessary to ensure such tragedies as the Omagh
bombing never happen again.
	   Blair announced the proposed new measures during a visit Tuesday
to the boarded-up, gutted downtown where a car bomb set off by
Irish Republican Army dissidents killed 28 people and wounded 330
others on Aug.15.
	   He said Parliament would be recalled Sept. 2 to approve
legislation that would make it easier to secure convictions against
suspected members of violent paramilitary groups accused of
organizing attacks in defiance of April's peace accord.
	   The proposals _ which Blair announced after shaking hands and
saying ``I'm so sorry'' to hundreds of appreciative residents in
drizzling rain _ closely mirror proposed laws that the Irish
government intends to enact at its own emergency parliamentary
session before U.S. President Bill Clinton arrives Sept. 3 to tour
Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.
	   Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern said the recall of both
parliaments on the same dates ``symbolizes effectively the shared
determination of the two governments to deal decisively with any
groups who persist in violence in defiance of the clear will of the
people of the island.''
	   The two premiers planned to meet Wednesday to discuss their
governments' security plans and the Northern Ireland peace process
in general.
	   Blair's proposals include a provision allowing judges to infer
guilt from a defendant's refusal to cooperate with any relevant
inquiry, which could effectively abolish the right to silence for
suspected members of violent splinter groups.
	   Members of paramilitary groups often maintain disciplined
silence when questioned.
	   Blair said the new British law would allow testimony of senior
detectives to be used to convict people of belonging to outlawed
paramilitary groups, something that has normally been difficult to
do.
	   Admitting these plans were ``of a very draconian and fundamental
nature,'' Blair said he considered them ``right and justified in
these circumstances.''
	   He said IRA dissidents and other armed opponents of the peace
agreement that set out how Northern Ireland should be governed were
``outcasts from the community. And people rightly expect that we
will take whatever measures we can, properly and legitimately, to
bring those responsible to justice.''
	   The government also will ask Parliament to pass legislation to
crack down on anyone, including foreigners based in Britain, who
may be planning terrorist acts abroad.
	   ``In the wake of recent terrorist activity abroad, this is a
timely and right move to underscore our total commitment to
defeating terrorism wherever it is plotted or executed,'' Blair
said, adding that several nations have expressed concerns about
their citizens plotting from Britain.
	   Most local politicians, Protestant and Catholic alike, have
demanded decisive government action following the Omagh attack _
the deadliest in 30 years of bloodshed in Northern Ireland.
	   ``If we're to have peace, there is no method too stringent,''
said moderate Catholic politician Paddy McGowan, gesturing to
passing Omagh pedestrians and noting that most were related to
somebody killed or wounded in the blast.
	   But Sinn Fein politicians criticized Blair's proposals, and
Omagh council members from the IRA-allied party avoided the prime
minister's visit.

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Sydney Olympic tickets will cost from
10 to 1,382 Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 5.80 to 801) under a
ticketing policy announced Wednesday.
	   The Sydney Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG)
said 75 percent of the 9.6 million tickets would be made available
to Australians, with 70 percent costing less than 60 Australian
dollars (U.S. dlrs 34.80) and 80 percent less than 100 Australian
dollars (U.S. dlrs 58).
	   A total of 5 million tickets will be on sale through a mail
order offer to start in mid-1999.
	   The most expensive sporting event tickets will be for finals
sessions in swimming, athletics, men's basketball and artistic
gymnastics, with a top of the range session ticket costing 455
Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 264).
	   The top price 1,382 Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 801) tickets
will be for prime seats at the opening and closing ceremonies.
	   SOCOG said Australians would have the greatest per capita access
to tickets of any Olympic host nation.
	   For Atlanta in 1996 there were 12.2 million tickets on offer
with a U.S. population of 260 million and in Barcelona in 1992
there were 4.2 million tickets with a Spanish population of 39
million.
	   Some 750,000 tickets will be allocated to foreign national
Olympic committees to be sold within their countries.

Lopez, McGann making it difficult on captain Rankin
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The 10 automatic qualifiers for the U.S. Solheim
Cup team are virtually a lock. Only Rosie Jones has a chance to get
the last spot, and she'll need nothing less than a win this week at
the LPGA State Farm Rail Classic.
	   That hasn't made life any easier for captain Judy Rankin.
	   For the past month, Rankin has been checking her charts and her
conscience, trying to figure out which two players will be her
captain's picks for the Solheim Cup matches against Europe next
month at Muirfield Village.
	   ``Agony? I like that word,'' Rankin said Tuesday from her home
in Midland, Texas. ``This is the time of the year when I'm not
sleeping real well. It's not so hard to pick two people who will
enhance the team. The hardest part is the two or three people left
behind.
	   ``I know emotionally how much people put into it, how badly they
want it, and you get a little bit of a villainous feeling,'' she
said. ``These last two picks wear on you. I hate hurting people.''
	   Fresh in her memory is a tearful conversation she had in 1996
with Nancy Lopez. Rankin announced her two picks, and the LPGA's
biggest star was not one of them.
	   ``I felt horrible telling her she wasn't going,'' Rankin
recalled. ``She did, too. But she could not have acted any
classier.''
	   Two years later, not much has changed.
	   Lopez is 15th in Solheim Cup standings going into the Rail
Classic and has no chance of getting enough points to move into the
top 10 for an automatic berth.
	   Even more troubling is that Lopez isn't playing well enough to
merit consideration. She started the season No. 7 in the Solheim
standings and has slowly worked her way down.
	   Lopez has earned points in only two out of her 17 events this
year _ she was in a seven-way tie for sixth at the Los Angeles
Open, and she lost a four-way playoff at the Sara Lee.
	   At one point, Lopez played six straight weeks without earning a
point.
	   ``She was pretty down and discouraged,'' Rankin said. ``She made
a calculated decision to take two weeks off for a final run.''
	   Lopez returned last week and was four off the lead going into
the final round, but closed with a 74 and tied for 39th.
	   ``She knows what's at stake,'' Rankin said. ``She's just not had
a good year, not played well this year.''
	   Still, Rankin will give her every consideration if Lopez can
rise to the occasion at the Rail Classic.
	   Why?
	   Because no one else has exactly turned the captain's head.
	   Meg Mallon has had a strong year and is a lock in the eighth
spot. And Rankin got some help from Brandie Burton, who won the du
Maurier Classic and tied for second at the Women's British Open.
	   That essentially freed up a captain's choice for Rankin. Burton
is tough in match play _ she has played in every Solheim Cup since
turning pro in 1991 as a 19-year-old and has a 5-2-1 record.
	   Everyone else is in a free fall, or simply made their move too
late.
	   Michelle McGann got as high as No. 4 after tying for ninth at
the Standard Register PING on March 22, but did not register
another top-10 finish until her tie for eighth two weeks ago. She's
off the map at No. 14.
	   Barb Mucha, who won the four-way playoff at Sara Lee, is 13th
but has no Solheim Cup experience. At No. 12 is Sherri Steinhauer,
based on her victory at the British Open.
	   Jones, at No. 11, would likely take up one of Rankin's picks
because she has played consistently well the past two months and
has the experience of two Solheim Cups.

Jacobsen says Woods should do more charity tournaments
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALOHA, Oregon (AP) _ Peter Jacobsen has a suggestion for Tiger
Woods: Lighten up a little, smile more and play some charity golf
tournaments.
	   Like Jacobsen's own Fred Meyer Challenge.
	   The Challenge is one of the most popular non-PGA Tour events in
golf. Players had nothing but compliments for this year's event and
its new home, the sprawling Reserve Vineyards and Golf Club west of
Portland. With more room and more hospitality booths for fans, the
36-hole event drew a record 54,907 fans over three days.
	   Having players like Arnold Palmer, Mark O'Meara and David Duval
compete gave the Challenge the feel of a big-golf event, but
Jacobsen is dying to land Woods.
	   ``I talk to him about it all the time,'' Jacobsen said after
Tuesday's final round. ``I said, `I'm going to get you some day,'
and he said, `I will play. But I just don't know when.'''
	   Woods was in Portland just last week, serving as host to an
invitation-only golf clinic for kids from area youth programs at
the Heron Lakes Golf Course.
	   Jacobsen praised the 22-year-old's success, but said he should
devote more time to charity events _ which usually have much
smaller purses _ like many of 24 Challenge competitors who have
their own tournaments.
	   ``I go do their events, and they come do my events. That's what
it's all about, helping other guys help their communities,''
Jacobsen said.
	   Jacobsen also said that Woods could do more to reach out to
fans.
	   ``A lot of Tiger's problem is that he doesn't stop and smile at
people. He just puts his head down and walks,'' Jacobsen said.
	   ``Mark O'Meara and I talk about it all the time,'' Jacobsen said
of Woods' neighbor, friend and practice partner. ``He's always
saying to him, `Tiger, you're 22 years old. There are a lot of
people that love you. Don't just put your focus on golf.'''
	   Jacobsen said he understands why Woods hasn't accepted an
invitation to the Challenge yet.
	   ``It's fine, because he's trying to get his feet firmly on the
ground, and I wholeheartedly endorse that because what he's going
through right now is unbelievable,'' Jacobsen said. ``People
pulling at him, requesting his time.
	   ``I think Tiger's amazing. He'll be here some day.''
	   A portion of the Challenge's profits go to various Portland-area
children's charities.

Graf destroys Nagyova

<TEXT>
	   NEW HAVEN, Connecticut (AP) _ A business-like Steffi Graf
dismantled Henrieta Nagyova of Slovakia 6-1, 6-3 Tuesday night to
advance to the quarterfinals of the Pilot Pen International women's
tournament.
	   Graf, tournament's No. 4 seed and the winner of 21 Grand Slam
singles titles, pounded Nagyova deep with powerful,
sideline-hugging groundstrokes. She won the first set in 20
minutes, breaking the No. 24-ranked Nagyova twice.
	   ``That was my main goal, just to go as relaxed out there as I
can,'' said Graf, who decided to enter the tournament to work on
her admittedly suffering confidence and consistency. She has won
only one match in each of her last two tournaments.
	   Nagyova, who had won two tournaments this year and both her Fed
Cup matches against Belgium, could not even capitalize on several
service break opportunities Graf allowed in the second set.
	   Graf, 29, is in the midst of a comeback bid, with the Pilot Pen
her ninth tournament. Ranked 38th in the world, she has reached the
semifinals three times this year.
	   ``Obviously I want to play that kind of tennis against the top
players,'' she said.
	   Graf will face the winner of Wednesday's match between Russian
sensation Anna Kournikova and Amanda Coetzer of South Africa.
	   Also Tuesday, sixth-seeded Patty Schnyder of Switzerland used
her impressive forehand to beat Rita Grande of Italy 6-4, 6-3 and
advance to the second round.
	   Schnyder used a combination of precision and power to prevent
the taller Grande, a qualifier, from setting up at the net.
	   ``I think I can still play more aggressive,'' said Schnyder, who
has won five tournaments this year and is ranked No. 10 in the
world.
	   Even with her victories, Schnyder, 19, said she has become used
to staying out of the spotlight now being lavished on the younger,
rising stars of women's tennis.
	   ``I like my life. I wouldn't want to change with them,'' she
said of players such as Martina Hingis and Kournikova. ``Of course,
I would like to play more Center Court ... (so) I think they have
an advantage, but still, I mean, as long as I win my matches it is
all right also.''
	   Schnyder will play Anke Huber, who beat Silvia Farina of Italy,
6-2, 6-3. Huber returned to the tour two weeks ago in Boston
following a four-month rehab after Achille's tendon surgery.
	   In other matches Tuesday, Chanda Rubin beat Elena Likhovtseva of
Russia 3-6, 6-3, 6-1, and qualifier Virginia Ruano-Pascual beat
Anne Miller 6-2, 3-6, 6-2.
	   Rubin, who improved her career record against Likhovtseva to
3-0, will next face Wimbledon champion Jana Novotna, the
tournament's No. 2 seed and the third-ranked player in the world.
	   ``I have to go out and play a solid match _ keep fighting, be
aggressive,'' Rubin said.
	   Ruano-Pascual will face top-seeded Lindsay Davenport in the
second round.

Rafter averts upset in opening round
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COMMACK, New York (AP) _ Patrick Rafter, one of the hottest
players on the ATP Tour over the last 10 weeks, broke Javier
Sanchez's serve in the final game of a 6-2, 4-6, 6-4 victory over
the Spaniard in the opening round of the Hamlet Cup on Tuesday.
	   Rafter, who returned from a weekend break in Bermuda after his
career-best 11-match winning streak was snapped by Guillaume Raoux
last week, used a strong backhand to overtake Sanchez, who is
ranked 101st, for the decisive point.
	   The Australian, the No. 2 seed in the tournament and the
third-ranked player in the world, returned serve with his backhand
and the ball hit the top of the net and flew past Sanchez. It was
the second such point in the set and third in the match that he won
in like manner.
	   Rafter, 25, is 22-3 with three tournament titles over the last
10 weeks, with five matches won over top 10 opponents, including
Pete Sampras.
	   Rafter, who had seven aces to four for Sanchez, has a 41-16
match record this year with four championships.
	   ``I hit the ball well in the first set but was very flat in the
second,'' Rafter said. ``I felt there was no use pushing myself, so
I went through the motions determined that I could get a second win
in the third set.
	   ``That's what happened. This is the quickest court I have played
on all summer, but I'll get adjusted to it once I get match sharp.
I hadn't played a match since New Haven and just got away from
tennis while in Bermuda.
	   ``My mistake was letting Sanchez back into the match. He got
stronger as we went along. There was one point in the match when I
wondered if I could get back, but make no mistake about it ... the
energy is back. I want to go all the way here and be even better in
the U.S. Open.''
	   Felix Mantilla, another Spaniard who is seeded eighth,
eliminated countryman Sergi Bruguera 6-4, 6-4 and Felix Dewulf of
Belgium outlasted doubles standout Mark Woodforde of Australia 6-4
(7-6 (8-6). Woodforde smashed his racket in frustration.
	   ``I wasn't proud of that,'' he said. ``Losing this match ticked
me off. Not once did I come close to breaking serve. Smashing the
racket isn't going to make me win, good tennis will. I want to stay
in singles until 2000 and be in the Olympics since they are in our
country.''

	   In the day's biggest upset, Amelie Mauresmo of France beat

ranked No. 32 in the world, said she was not surprised to beat the
fifth-seeded Tauziat, the Wimbledon finalist who is ranked No. 9 in
the world.
	   ``I know I can beat the best players,'' she said.

Microsoft's Windows 98 a hot item in Japan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Sales in Japan of Microsoft's new Windows 98
operating system topped 500,000 in the first month, more than
triple the software giant's own forecasts, a news report said
Wednesday.
	   More than 250,000 copies of the Japanese-language version were
sold in the first two days after it hit store shelves here July 25,
the Nihon Keizai newspaper reported, citing an unnamed source in
the company.
	   A spokesman for Microsoft in Japan refused to confirm the sales
figures.
	   But spokesman Akira Iwase did say that ``sales have been much
better than we expected.''
	   Japanese consumers' appetite for the new operating system
surprised Microsoft, which had projected it would take three months
to sell 500,000 copies, the newspaper reported.
	   The strong demand for Windows 98 has helped boost Japan's
sagging computer market, with sales of personal computers rising by
as much as 30 percent since the new system was released, the report
said.

 &UR; By DAVID KINNEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WILLIAMSPORT, Pennsylvania (AP) _ Toms River (U.S. East) stars
Todd Frazier and Casey Gaynor are engaged in a little one-upmanship
in this week's Little League World Series.
	   They watched in awe three years ago when their older brothers,
Jeff Frazier and Colin Gaynor, hit home runs in the series. Now the
younger pair get their chance, and they're making the most of it.
	   Todd Frazier went 3-for-4 with a two-run home run and Casey
Gaynor threw a five-hitter Tuesday as Toms River beat Greenville,
North Carolina (U.S. South) 5-3 to claim a spot in Thursday's U.S.
championship game.
	   ``I can show him up now,'' Frazier said good-naturedly. ``Now I
can tell him I hit two home runs and he only got one.''
	   The 12-year-old leadoff hitter and shortstop is 4-for-8, to be
exact, with a grand slam and seven RBIs in Toms River's three wins.
He also threw a three-hitter Monday in a 4-2 victory over Cypress,
California (U.S. West).
	   The 3-0 start itself is a change over 1995, when Toms River went
1-2 and didn't advance.
	   The North Carolinians are 1-1 and face Cypress, Calif., on
Wednesday with a trip to the U.S. pool final at stake. Cypress
improved to 1-1 by beating Jenison, Michigan (U.S. Central) 4-1,
Tuesday night. Starter Matt Swims gave up five hits and struck out
seven.
	   Jenison, who never recovered from a 13-9 loss in 11 innings
Sunday night, finished 0-3.
	   Also Tuesday, Sean Sargent hit two home runs, including a
three-run shot to cap a five-run seventh inning, as Langley,
Canada, beat Kashima, Japan, 10-5, and Sammy Al-Rajhi's bloop
single brought home the game-winning run as Dhahran, Saudi Arabia,
beat Guadalupe, Mexico, 8-7.
	   Guadalupe went 5-0 on the way to last year's championship. This
year's club went 0-3.
	   Dhahran is 1-1 and must beat Langley (2-0) Wednesday to vie for
a very slim chance to advance to Thursday's international pool
final. Kashima is 2-1 and also in the running.
	   In the international pool, Langley went into the sixth inning
trailing 5-1 before scoring four runs in that inning and five more
in the seventh, hitting four of its five home runs in the game. The
Canadians have hit eight homers in the series.
	   Mike Erickson led off the sixth with a solo home run, his third
of the series, and Jeff Duda followed two walks with a three-run
shot to tie it 5-5. Langley starter Jordan Lennerton followed
Sargent's seventh-inning shot with a two-run homer.
	   Kashima starter Takeshi Kato gave up one run _ Sargent's first
homer _ and four hits over five innings before manager Atsushi
Ohkawa pulled him before the final inning and the trouble started.
	   Tetsuya Furukawa went 2-for-4 with a grand slam, a double and
five RBIs and is 6-for-11 with two homers and seven RBIs in three
games.
	   Dhahran broke a 4-4 tie in a four-run fifth inning keyed by Tony
Davidson's two-run homer. Davidson added a single and a triple and
had four RBIs.
	   The winners of the U.S. and international pool championships
advance to Saturday's final.

Clemens strikes out 18 as Blue Jays down Royals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Roger Clemens struck out 18 and won his 11th
straight decision as he pitched Toronto to 3-0 victory over Kansas
City on Tuesday night.
	   Clemens, who has struck out 20 in a nine-inning game twice and
shares the record with Chicago Cubs rookie Kerry Wood, had 14
strikeouts in the first seven innings.
	   It was the 89th double-digit strikeout game of Clemens' career.
He allowed three hits and walked none while improving his record to
16-6.
	   Clemens, who hasn't lost since May 29, matched San Diego's Kevin
Brown for the major-league high winning streak this season. It was
Clemens' second shutout of the season _ both accomplished in his
last two starts _ and 43rd of his career.
	   The Blue Jays took a 1-0 lead in the first when Kansas City
starter Chris Haney (5-6) walked Jose Cruz Jr. with the bases
loaded. Craig Grebeck hit a two-run single in the seventh to make
it 3-0.
 &UR; Red Sox 3, Athletics 2 &QC;

the seventh inning and Nomar Garciaparra went 4-for-4 as Boston
beat Oakland.
	   Garciaparra, who went 0-for-5 in his previous game Sunday,
singled in his first three at-bats before doubling in the seventh
to equal his career-high hit game, accomplished four times during
his 1997 AL Rookie of the Year season.
	   The win was Boston's eighth in nine games against the Athletics
this season. Mike Blowers had a solo homer for Oakland, which
suffered only its second loss in eight games.
 &UR; Indians 10, Mariners 4 &QC; 
	   In Cleveland, Manny Ramirez was 4-for-4 with his 31st homer and
five RBIs as Cleveland defeated Seattle.
	   Ken Griffey Jr., who leads the AL with 44 homers, was 1-for-4
with a single and a walk, failing to homer for the first time in
three games.
	   Ramirez singled, doubled twice and hit a 432-foot homer, missing
only a triple in his bid to become the first Cleveland player in 20
years to hit for the cycle.
	   The Indians won for the sixth time in nine games and scored
seven runs with two outs.
 &UR; Twins 4, Devil Rays 1 &QC; 
	   In St. Petersburg, Florida, Frankie Rodriguez, starting because
Minnesota traded Mike Morgan earlier in the day, pitched 7 2-3
shutout innings to lead the Twins over Tampa Bay.

beating the Yankees last week, allowed five hits, struck out eight
and walked two. He was pressed into action after Morgan was sent to
the Chicago Cubs for cash and a player to be named.
	   Pat Meares hit a solo homer in the fifth off Rolando Arrojo
(11-11), and David Ortiz and Marty Cordova hit solo shots in the
sixth.

Three Japanese arrested for alleged drug-smuggling
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ In an apparent bungled smuggling attempt, three
Japanese men have been arrested on suspicion of trying to bring
hundreds of kilograms (pounds) of illegal stimulant drugs into the
country, police said Wednesday.
	   Koji Kawakami, a spokesman for the Mie prefectural, or state,
police in southwestern Japan, identified the three as fishing boat
captain Tamio Sumi, 52, Shoichi Iwasaki, 33, and Tadato Miyazaki,
42. Iwasaki and Miyazaki are both unemployed, Kawakami said.
	   Police believe Sumi, in cooperation with organized crime
elements, tried to smuggle into the country about 300 kilograms
(660 pounds) of stimulants using his 14.7-ton fishing boat,
Kawakami said.
	   The street value in Japan of the drugs was estimated at 18
billion yen (dlrs 125 million), Kawakami said.
	   From Sunday through Tuesday, police found a total of 99
kilograms (218 pounds) of stimulants in several polyethylene bags
floating in the Pacific Ocean off the Kochi prefecture fishing town
of Kubokawa, about 625 kilometers (387 miles) southwest of Tokyo.
	   The arrests came after police questioned owners of fishing boats
and other vessels that had sailed in the area around the middle of
August.
	   Suspicions were aroused after a local junior high school student
in a boat reported finding 10 mysterious bags floating in the water
on Aug. 15.
	   The men were arrested Tuesday evening in Owase, a fishing town
377 kilometers 234 miles), southwest of Tokyo, Kawakami said.
	   There, Sumi told police he was asked to smuggle the drugs after
receiving them from another vessel off the coast of Kyushu, Japan's
southwestern main island, Kawakami said.
	   Kawakami quoted Sumi as telling investigators he dumped all of
the drugs into the sea from his boat off Kubokawa on the way to
Owase, thinking that he was ``under surveillance by police.'' All
the stimulants had been placed in polyethylene bags.
	   Police have also obtained an arrest warrant for a fourth man
aboard Sumi's boat and who is believed to be a member of a criminal
gang, Kawakami said.
	   Police were analyzing the contents of the stimulants seized so
far to determine what kind of drugs were found and were also
searching for the rest of the alleged haul.
	   Japan's maximum penalty for trafficking in stimulant drugs or
heroin is life imprisonment.

Explosion kills woman, injures dozens

	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ A bomb exploded inside a crowded
Planet Hollywood restaurant Tuesday, killing one person and
injuring 24. A man claiming responsibility said it was revenge for
U.S. attacks on targets in Sudan and Afghanistan.
	   The caller to the radio station Cape Talk claimed responsibility
on behalf of a group called Muslims Against Global Oppression,
according to Marianne Merten, a journalist at the station. A
spokesman for the group, Mogammat Achmat, in comments to South
African Broadcasting Corp., denied his group was involved.
	   Police refused to comment on the call.
	   In Washington, the State Department said the group was
anti-Jewish and anti-Israeli. It was unknown to the department's
counter-terrorism office until it staged a demonstration at the
vacant Israeli diplomatic office in Cape Town in July 1997,
officials said. The marchers shouted angry slogans aimed at Israel.
	   Some members were among the 40 or so people who protested U.S.
policies on Iraq and Israel during U.S. President Bill Clinton's
visit to Cape Town in March.
	   Police Senior Superintendent John Sterrenberg said the device
exploded at 7:20 p.m. inside Planet Hollywood as it was packed with
diners. He confirmed one woman was killed. Her nationality and
those of the injured were not immediately known.
	   A witness who had been at the ground-floor bar in the two-story
Hollywood-theme restaurant described a horrific scene.
	   ``I saw people without limbs,'' Bertie Liebenberg, who was
visiting from Johannesburg, told the South African Press
Association. ``Decor on the ceiling came crashing down, and crashed
onto people, tables and chairs.''
	   Roger Sedres, a local photographer, said he heard the explosion
as he drove past the restaurant, then saw the wounded come
streaming out.
	   One woman sat outside the restaurant, her head in her hands,
screaming: '' `Oh God, please tell me my legs are still there,' ''
Sedres said. The woman's legs were intact.
	   Rescue workers brought out another woman who was motionless, her
legs mangled.
	   Police cordoned off the restaurant in the trendy Victoria and
Albert Waterfront and were reinforced with armored cars. Ambulances
with sirens wailing rushed to the scene.
	   Nico Smuts, spokesman for Leisurenet, the franchise holders of
Planet Hollywood, said the Cape Town branch was wholly South
African-owned.
	   However, there was speculation that an attack on a target
identified with the United States could be a sequel to the bombings
of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 257
people on Aug. 7 _ or an answer to America's retaliatory
cruise-missile attacks on targets in Afghanistan and Sudan.
	   A spokesman for Planet Hollywood, which is based in Orlando,
Florida, said the company was attempting to gather information from
local authorities.
	   ``Our hearts and prayers go out to all the injured and their
families,'' said Matt Hallman, director of national public
relations.

Dollar, Tokyo stock prices slip in morning trading
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with midday stock, bond and currency

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar moved lower against the Japanese
yen in lackluster trading Wednesday morning. Tokyo stock prices
slipped on concerns political wrangling will delay efforts to clean
up the bad-loan-plagued banking system.
	   The dollar bought 144.53 yen at midday, down 0.23 yen from late
Tuesday in Tokyo but above its late New York rate of 144.21 yen
overnight.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
fell 71.23 points, or 0.47 percent, to 15,001.70 at the close of
morning trading. On Tuesday, the average finished up 84.57 points,
or 0.56 percent.
	   Traders saw some yen-buying from domestic investment trust
funds, but selling pressure by U.S. institutional investors
continued to weigh on the Japanese currency amid a lack of market
moving news.
	   The yen had gained earlier in the week on persistent fears
Japanese authorities would intervene in markets to support their
currency.
	   While caution over possible yen-supportive intervention was
still a factor, dealers said the dollar remains well-supported on
the downside.
	   Quiet trading also prevailed on Tokyo's stock market. Prices
fell as traders expressed concern a series of bills aimed at
cleaning up the massive bad loan problems at Japanese banks may
fail to pass Parliament.
	   Debate on the six bills began Tuesday, but smooth passage is
doubtful as opposition parties have said they oppose the use of
public funds to bail out banks.
	   ``Fear that steps to stabilize the banking system will be
delayed is hurting the market's mood,'' said Sachio Ishikawa,
general manager of the stock division at Chuo Securities Co.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 5.72 points, or 0.49 percent, to 1,156.86.
The TOPIX closed up 4.28 points, or 0.37 percent, the day before.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 1.115 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.125 percent,
driving its price up to 112.32 yen from 112.26 yen.

	   TORONTO (AP) _ Roger Clemens struck out 18 and won his 11th
straight decision as he pitched Toronto to 3-0 victory over Kansas
City on Tuesday night.
	   Clemens, who has struck out 20 in a nine-inning game twice and
shares the record with Chicago Cubs rookie Kerry Wood, had 14
strikeouts in the first seven innings.
	   It was the 89th double-digit strikeout game of Clemens' career.

	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Mark McGwire remained at 53 homers, going
0-for-4 with a walk Tuesday night in the St. Louis Cardinals' 4-3
loss to the Florida Marlins.
	   He has 31 games remaining to reach the record of 61 that Roger
Maris set in 1961. Twenty of those games are at Busch Stadium,
where McGwire has 27 homers this season. His walk with the bases
loaded in the fourth inning raised his season total to 138, 32
behind the record Babe Ruth set in 1923.
	   McGwire narrowly missed homering in the first, flying out to the
fence in straightaway center. He reached on an error in the third
and grounded out in both the sixth and eighth innings.
	   Rafael Medina (1-1) got his first major league win, and Antonio
Alfonseca got his seventh save. Donovan Osborne (3-3) was the
loser.
 &UR; Padres 5, Phillies 3
	   In Philadelphia, Ken Caminiti homered twice, Mark Sweeney went
4-for-4 and Kevin Brown (17-4) pitched seven innings of five-hit
ball to tie Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine for the NL lead in wins.
	   Caminiti hit a solo shot in the fifth off Curt Schilling (12-12)
for a 4-1 lead, then hit his 26th homer in the ninth against Mark
Leiter. Trevor Hoffman pitched the ninth for his major
league-leading 42nd save, tying a career high.
	   Mark Sweeney of the Padres went 4-for-4 with two doubles, a walk
and a
 &UR; Astros 3, Braves 2
	   In Houston, Mike Hampton (10-6) struck out a career-high 12 and
got his first victory since July 31 as Houston won its fifth
straight.
	   Houston stopped Atlanta's four-game winning streak and moved
within 4{ games of the Braves for the best record in the NL.
	   Carl Everett broke a 2-all tie in the sixth with an RBI double
off Kevin Millwood (14-8). Billy Wagner struck out the side in the
ninth for his 25th save.

three games.
	   Ramirez singled, doubled twice and hit a 432-foot homer, missing
only a triple in his bid to become the first Cleveland player in 20
years to hit for the cycle.
	   The Indians won for the sixth time in nine games and scored
seven runs with two outs.
 &UR; Twins 4, Devil Rays 1 &QC; 
	   In St. Petersburg, Florida, Frankie Rodriguez, starting because
Minnesota traded Mike Morgan earlier in the day, pitched 7 2-3
shutout innings to lead the Twins over Tampa Bay.
	   Rodriguez (4-2), who had been scheduled for long relief since
beating the Yankees last week, allowed five hits, struck out eight
and walked two. He was pressed into action after Morgan was sent to
the Chicago Cubs for cash and a player to be named.
	   Pat Meares hit a solo homer in the fifth off Rolando Arrojo
(11-11), and David Ortiz and Marty Cordova hit solo shots in the
sixth.

Sydney wakes up to another water contamination scare

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ For the second time in a month, Sydney
residents Wednesday awoke to warnings that the tap water in the
city that will host the 2000 Olympics is unfit to drink.
	   In a city that considers itself one of the world's most modern
and urbane, water fountains in school playgrounds were shut down
and signs put up in office blocks warning people not to drink the
water unless it had been boiled for at least one minute.
	   The warning was issued by the New South Wales state Health
Department, which said testing in the past two days found that high
levels of the dangerous microscopic parasites giardia and
cyptosporidium had reappeared in the city's water system.
	   The warning went out to almost all of Sydney's suburbs, and
applies to the vast majority of Sydney 3.7 million residents.
	   Residents should boil water before drinking, cleaning teeth,
gargling, washing uncooked foods such as salads and making ice, the
department said. Schoolchildren should take bottled water to
school.
	   The outbreak is the second water contamination scare within four
weeks. For more than a week from late July, Sydney residents were
instructed to boil their water or risk serious illness from the
parasites.
	   Giardia, normally spread through human or animal fecal matter,
can cause diarrhea and other gastrointestinal problems.
Cryptosporidium is spread in similar fashion. It causes flu-like
symptoms and can kill people with weak immune systems, including
the very young and the elderly.
	   The outbreak caused severe embarrassment for Australia's largest
city, as the international spotlight intensifies in the lead-up to
the Olympics. The earlier scare also came the day U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright and Defense Secretary William Cohen
attended top level meetings in the city.
	   State Health Department Director-General Mick Reid on Wednesday
said the latest test results indicated the levels of
cryptosporidium were higher this time than during the previous
scare.
	   ``I'm terribly concerned. This is a major decision to advise a
large component of Sydney residents to boil their water. This is
not an issue which is attractive to anyone,'' Reid told Australian
Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   He said heavy rainfall in the Sydney catchment area in recent
weeks may be responsible for the contamination.
	   ``Sydney has experienced unprecedented rainfall over the last
month, and our dams are full and that may have contributed to it,''
he said.
	   Cryptosporidium got into the water supply of Milwaukee, Wis., in
1993, killing about 100 people. More than 400,000 others were
sickened.
	   No cases of illness were reported after the earlier Sydney
outbreak.
	   An inquiry is still underway into its cause. Theories include
that dead dogs found in waterways leading to a water treatment
plant contaminated the system.
	   The plant was cleaned up and the city's water system flushed
with clean water. An Australian dollars 35 million (U.S. dlrs 21
million) upgrade of the city's water supply was announced.
	   Two senior executives of Sydney Water have resigned from the
utility since the previous scare.

Police patrol Indonesian city after clash at party congress

 &UR; Eds: One name only for Soerjadi is correct &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Security was tight and some shops were
shut Wednesday in a northern city amid fears of more violence after
police battled protesters outside a political party congress.
	   Seventeen people were injured in the Sulawesi island city of
Palu on Tuesday when supporters of pro-democracy leader Megawati
Sukarnoputri tried to disrupt a congress held by a rival party
faction.
	   Protesters hurled stones and police fired warning shots and tear
gas.
	   On Wednesday, delegates gathered at the congress but there were
no reports of violence.
	   Megawati was ousted as head of the minority Indonesian
Democratic Party in a 1996 party congress sponsored by the
government of former President Suharto, then Indonesia's autocratic
leader.
	   Soerjadi, the government-backed candidate who replaced Megawati,
opened a congress this week in Palu to pick a new leader of the
party, known by its Indonesian acronym PDI.
	   Fighting broke out when 1,000 Megawati backers converged on the
building where the congress was being held, claiming that Soerjadi
had been illegally installed as chief of the party.
	   Megawati is the eldest daughter of Sukarno, Indonesia's founding
president. She is seen as a strong candidate for president in
elections scheduled next year.
	   Suharto quit in May amid riots and student protests. His
successor, B.J. Habibie, is implementing democratic reforms in the
nation of 202 million.
	   Megawati was ousted as PDI leader because she called for greater
democracy.
	   Her ouster triggered riots in Jakarta on July 27, 1996,
following the storming of the party's headquarters by police and
Soerjadi's supporters.
	   At least five people were killed and more than a dozen are still
missing from the rioting.

Rafter averts upset in opening round

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Rios-Kuerten match &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   COMMACK, New York _ Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil won a South
American showdown Tuesday night, upsetting Marcelos Rios of Chile
6-3, 7-6 (7-4) in the opening round of the Hamlet Cup.
	   Rios, the tournament's top seed, lost his second match in as
many days. He lost his ranking as the top-ranked player in the
world on Monday.
	   Rios has lost three of his last four matches since parting with
Larry Stefanki, his coach.
	   Rios was ranked No. 1 for six weeks earlier this year.
	   Kuerten said he was looking forward to playing Rios.
	   ``People asked me if I was disappointed that I drew him in the
first round,'' Kuerten said, ``but I really wanted him. The talent
on this level is very high and you should want to play the great
players. That's why we're out here.''
	   Rios said he was ``bothered by an allergy and my entire body is
weak. Maybe I need a rest to get ready for the U.S. Open.''
	   The tournament's No. 2 seed, Patrick Rafter of Australia,
flirted with defeat as well Tuesday. Rafter, one of the hottest
players on the ATP Tour over the last 10 weeks, broke Javier
Sanchez's serve in the final game of a 6-2, 4-6, 6-4 victory over
the Spaniard.
	   Rafter, who returned from a weekend break in Bermuda after his
career-best 11-match winning streak was snapped by Guillaume Raoux
last week, used a strong backhand to overtake Sanchez, who is
ranked 101st, for the decisive point.
	   The Australian, the third-ranked player in the world, returned
serve with his backhand and the ball hit the top of the nwet and
flew past Sanchez. It was the second such point in the set and
third in the match that he won in like manner.
	   Rafter, 25, is 22-3 with three tournament titles over the last
10 weeks, with five matches won over top 10 opponents, including
Pete Sampras.
	   Rafter, who had seven aces to four for Sanchez, has a 41-16
match record this year with four championships.
	   ``I hit the ball well in the first set but was very flat in the
second,'' Rafter said. ``I felt there was no use pushing myself, so
I went through the motions determined that I could get a second win
in the third set.
	   ``That's what happened. This is the quickest court I have played
on all summer, but I'll get adjusted to it once I get match sharp.
I hadn't played a match since New Haven and just got away from
tennis while in Bermuda.
	   ``My mistake was letting Sanchez back into the match. He got
stronger as we went along. There was one point in the match when I
wondered if I could get back, but make no mistake about it ... the
energy is back. I want to go all the way here and be even better in
the U.S. Open.''
	   Felix Mantilla, another Spaniard who is seeded eighth,
eliminated countryman Sergi Bruguera 6-4, 6-4 and Felix Dewulf of
Belgium outlasted doubles standout Mark Woodforde of Australia 6-4
(7-6 (8-6). Woodforde smashed his racket in frustration.
	   ``I wasn't proud of that,'' he said. ``Losing this match ticked
me off. Not once did I come close to breaking serve. Smashing the
racket isn't going to make me win, good tennis will. I want to stay
in singles until 2000 and be in the Olympics since they are in our
country.''

Duval, Furyk win Fred Meyer, Arnie gets the applause
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: RECAPS to SUB 16th graf to CORRECT holes to 16 and 17. &QL; 
 &UR; By LANDON HALL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ALOHA, Oregon (AP) _ David Duval and Jim Furyk won the punch
bowl and denim jackets. Arnold Palmer, however, was the star of the
final round of the Fred Meyer Challenge on Tuesday.
	   Palmer, who next week will begin seven weeks of daily radiation
therapy related to his prostate cancer surgery, said he may return
to competition before the treatment is completed.
	   ``I think the doctors will let me do what I want to, whatever I
feel like doing,'' Palmer, 68, said. ``Hopefully, this is just a
momentary delay.''
	   Duval and Furyk, who began the day two shots off the lead in the
best-ball, 24-player charity tournament, had five birdies in the
first seven holes and ran away with the tournament and dlrs 150,000
in prize money.
	   The pair shot 11-under par for the day, finishing at 18-under
126. Craig Stadler and Steve Elkington, who led after Monday's
first round, tied for second with Paul Stankowski and Scott
McCarron at 14-under 130.
	   Three teams _ Brad Faxon and Billy Andrade, Stewart Cink and
Steve Jones, and Fuzzy Zoeller and John Daly _ were five strokes
back. Faxon had eagles on Nos. 15 and 16.
	   Palmer and his partner, Challenge founder Peter Jacobsen,
finished nine strokes back.
	   Players all over the Reserve Vineyards and Golf Club were still
talking about Palmer's first-round 69. They also spoke about his
long list of accomplishments in a way that almost sounded like a
going-away party.
	   ``Arnold's the king, the king of golf,'' Stankowski said. ``You
can't say he's done a lot for the game _ he's done everything for
the game.''
	   ``We don't think of Arnie as being one of the older guys on the
senior tour. He's one of the young guys out here,'' Zoeller said.
	   Duval rebounded from a terrible showing in the PGA Championship
two weeks ago, in which he failed to make the cut after finishing
second in the Masters, 11th in the British Open and seventh in the
U.S. Open.
	   ``The golf course and I didn't agree. We're not on speaking
terms,'' said Duval, who is second on the PGA Tour money list
behind Vijay Singh. ``I didn't see a lot of putts going in the hole
the past couple weeks, but I saw a lot of putts going in the hole
these last two days.''
	   He and Furyk led Cink and Jones by just one stroke after nine
holes, but Furyk and Duval birdied Nos. 10-13 to pull away. They
got away with pars on the par-5 16th and 18th.
	   ``It was just kind of our day,'' said Furyk, who with Duval was
presented a crystal bowl and twin denim jackets.
	   The day also was kind for the perpetually troubled John Daly.
Earlier this month, Daly said he wouldn't play another PGA Tour
event this year, then withdrew from the Sprint International in
Denver.
	   Daly, wearing a jacket despite the 80-degree heat, looked
relaxed playing alongside Zoeller. The two friends smoked
cigarettes, chatted with the galleries and made a run at the
leaders before faltering with pars on Nos. 16-17.
	   ``He's going to play,'' Zoeller said, dismissing Daly's vow to
sit out the rest of the tour season. ``Sometimes you have to say
some negative things to yourself to motivate yourself.''
	   Daly didn't speak to reporters, but during the awards ceremony
thanked Jacobsen and the other pros for supporting him as he
continues to recover from alcohol addiction.
	   ``I just want to thank from the bottom of my heart the players.
You guys know what I'm going through.''

Bjorkman easily wins first-round match

<TEXT>
	   BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) _ Top-seeded Jonas Bjorkman posted an easy
6-2, 6-3 first-round victory Tuesday over Arnaud Clement in the MFS
Pro Tennis Championships at Longwood Cricket Club.
	   Things didn't go as well for the No. 2 seed, however, as Karol
Kucera of Slovakia had problems with his serve and was eliminated
by Jeff Tarango, 6-2, 6-3.
	   Bjorkman, who is ranked 12th on the ATP Tour computer, needed
only 65 minutes to dismiss Clement, a qualifier from France.
	   ``I played aggressive tennis today _ maybe I pressured him into
making mistakes,'' said Bjorkman, a semifinalist at last year's
U.S. Open. ``Every time I win, it gets my confidence up.''
	   The Swede had breaks in the fifth and seventh games of the first
set and lost his serve only once in the match.
	   The unseeded Tarango, who entered the tournament with a No. 66
ranking, beat Kucera in the long baseline battle. Kucera held his
serve only twice in the two sets.
	   ``The light was bad and the wind also hurt my serves,'' Kucera
said. ``The conditions were poor and I couldn't concentrate.''
	   Playing under the lights and in the wind didn't seem to bother
Tarango.
	   ``I've been waiting for a win like this all summer,'' he said.
``It was one of my best wins in a while. I think I threw him off by
hitting so hard and deep.''
	   Fourth-seeded Michael Chang shook off some first-set problems
before overcoming Andrei Pavel of Romania 7-5, 6-2.
	   Chang had to overcome a set point at 3-5 in the first set before
surviving. Once he got to deuce with an ace, he started his
comeback, taking the last four games of the set and he was in
complete control in the second set.
	   Also Tuesday, Jiri Novak of the Czech Republic beat
seventh-seeded Andrea Gaudenzi of Italy 4-6, 6-1, 6-1 and
Paraguay's Ramon Delgado, who ousted Pete Sampras from the French
Open, was eliminated by Lionel Roux of France, 6-4, 6-2.
	   In other matches, Paul Haarhuis of the Netherlands beat Lucas
Arnold of Argentina 6-1, 6-3; Andrew Ilie of Australia stopped
Franco Squillari of Argentina 6-4, 6-2; and Galo Blanco of Spain
outlasted Hernan Gumy of Argentina 3-6, 6-1, 6-4.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The man known as Thailand's Eliot Ness
was promoted to deputy commissioner of police in the department's
sweeping annual reshuffle, a government press release said
Wednesday.
	   Police Gen. Seri Temeyaves was elevated from chief of the
Central Investigation Bureau to one of six deputy commissioners,
the second most powerful posts in the department. He leaped over 10
other officers with more seniority.
	   Seri has been compared to former U.S. lawman Eliot Ness, made
famous by the Hollywood movie ``The Untouchables'' for his battles
against Chicago crime boss Al Capone.
	   Seri has also battled Thailand's top mob godfathers, but is best
known for fighting corruption within the police department and
among politicians.
	   He has been involved in some of Thailand's most high profile
criminal cases.
	   Seri claims to have never taken a bribe, a statement that would
be considered outlandish for many Thai policemen.
	   During his career, Seri has made many enemies among police and
politicians. In the early 1990s, his office was bombed, although he
escaped injury. He has said he believes crooked police were the
culprits.
	   During the previous administration of former Prime Minister
Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, Seri was transferred to a teaching post at a
police college.
	   His career was revived when the government of Prime Minister
Chuan Leekpai, generally regarded as more honest than its
predecessor, came to power in November 1997.
	   Seri first rose to prominence in the early 1980s when he fought
against communist insurgents in Thailand's northeast. He combined
tough tactics with projects to help poor communities, which helped
blunt the appeal of the rebels.

South Korea's largest auto parts maker idled by labor dispute
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Hyundai Motor Co. resumed production
Wednesday after a month-long strike, but may have to halt its auto
assembly lines again because of a lack of parts.
	   Hyundai officials said the company had only a five-day stockpile
of parts supplied by Mando Machinery Corp., which was idled by a
strike 10 days ago.
	   ``If Mando's strike does not end quickly, our assembly lines
will have to stop again,'' said Min Kyong-hwan, a Hyundai
spokesman.
	   Mando is a monopoly supplier of air conditioners, heaters,
alternators and other key components for Hyundai, South Korea's
largest automaker.
	   A 36-day strike at Hyundai ended two days ago with a
government-mediated compromise. After a one-day test run, Hyundai
reopened its assembly lines Wednesday.
	   Mando's trouble began Aug. 17 when its 7,000-member union struck
to protest the company's plan to lay off 300 workers. The company
said the layoffs were necessary because Hyundai and other
automakers have been operating at far less than capacity.
	   On Wednesday, some 100 Mando union leaders staged a rally in
front of Mando's headquarters in Kunpo, 23 kilometers (14 miles)
south of Seoul, demanding that the company cancel its layoff plan.
	   Mando is a subsidiary of the Halla group, South Korea's 12th
largest conglomerate. Halla defaulted on dlrs 220 million in debts
last December.
	   Halla plans to sell off an undisclosed amount of stock in Mando
to foreign investors in September. So far, Ford, General Motors and
a few other foreign carmakers reportedly have shown interest.
	   Mando sold 1.4 trillion won (dlrs 1 billion) worth of car
components last year, 80 percent of them to Hyundai.

Rahlves coming home after hurting hip
</HEADLINE>

	   LOM, Norway (AP) _ Olympic skier Daron Rahlves reinjured his
right hip in training on a Norwegian glacier and is heading home
for further tests, the U.S. Ski Team said Tuesday.
	   Coaches said Rahlves, 26, of Truckee, California, went down
Monday while skiing on the Juvass Glacier above this town 120 miles
(190 kilometers) northwest of Lillehammer. He was helicoptered off
the glacier and, with team Dr. Mel Boynton alongside, was taken to
a hospital in Lillehammer. After X-rays, he rejoined the team at
its hotel.
	   On Tuesday, he and coach Ueli Luthi left for Oslo. Rahlves was
to fly back to the United States on Wednesday and was expected to
undergo further medical examination. It was not known how long he
would be sidelined.
	   Rahlves dislocated his right hip in a fluke accident while
training in New Zealand during late summer of 1996 when his right
ski became caught in soft snow. He also underwent surgery a year
ago to stabilize a problem in his left shoulder.
	   ``I was standing there beside him two years ago when he was
injured in New Zealand and now he went down right by me again,''
U.S. coach Martin Andersen. ``Because this happened before, Daron
said he knew what was going on and this seemed much easier.
	   ``He said it wasn't even close to the pain he had in New Zealand
two years ago.''
	   Rahlves decided to focus fulltime on ski racing after winning
the 1993 Jet-ski Expert Class world title. He's the top super-G
skier on the U.S. team and scored his first World Cup points in
downhill last season. He also has won two U.S. giant slalom
championships.
