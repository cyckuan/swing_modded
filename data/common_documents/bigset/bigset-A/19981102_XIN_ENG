<HEADLINE> Egypt, Syria Hold Summit Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
held talks Sunday with visiting Syrian President Hafez al-Assad on
regional issues of common interest and bilateral relations,
particularly Mideast peace process and the stalled Syrian-Israeli
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The talks in the Red Sea resort Sharm el Sheikh centered on the
latest developments in the Middle East peace process following the
signing of a new agreement by Palestinians and Israel in
Washington last month, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
After nine-day's tough negotiations in the United States, the
Palestinians and Israel signed on October 23 the interim accord.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, Israel will withdraw from another 13.1 percent
of the West Bank and the Palestinians step up crackdown on Islamic
extremists. The two sides also agreed on some other key issues.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders are also expected to discuss the stalled
Syrian-Israeli negotiations and the possibility of resuming the
peace talks, according to the news agency.
</P>
<P>
The talks between Syria and Israel came to a standstill in
early 1996 due to disputes over the future of the Golan Heights
captured by Israel from Syria in the 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
The report said the talks are expected to touch on the
Syrian-Turkish relations in light of an agreement signed by
Damascus and Ankara following intensive Egyptian mediation aimed
at defusing tensions between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has accused Syria of sheltering its outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK) and threatened military actions against
Syria, sparking fear of a regional conflict.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to successful mediation by Egypt and Iran, Syria and
Turkey signed a deal on October 20, under which Syria agreed to
close PKK camps on its soil and in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa
Valley in Lebanon. Syria also agreed not to allow PKK to launch
cross-border attacks on Turkey's targets.
</P>
<P>
During the summit meeting, which Syrian Ambassador in Cairo
Eissa Darwish said is part of the regular meetings between Mubarak
and al-Assad, bilateral relations are also among the topics of
discussion.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian president arrived in Egypt earlier for a one-day
visit.

<HEADLINE> Global Congress on Immunology Opens in New Delhi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The global Congress on
Immunology opened here Sunday with a call by Indian President
Kocheril Raman Narayanan to free mankind from the scourge of
diseases.
</P>
<P>
Narayanan urged scientists of all countries in the world to
work together and share their knowledge and experience to achieve
this goal.
</P>
<P>
Over 2,600 scientists from 67 countries are attending the
week-long conference which is held once every three years.
</P>
<P>
Narayanan lamented that neither antibiotics nor the new
vaccines reach the poorest sections of the society who need them
most and asked scientists, industrialists and the governments to
"join hands so that fruits of research can be made available to
the common man with minimal delay at affordable cost".
</P>
<P>
This is the last global conference of immunologists in this
century and the millennium and also the first held in a developing
country.
</P>
<P>
The conference is organized by the International Union of
Immunological Societies with the Federation of Immunological
Societies of Asia and Oceania and the Indian Immunological Society
as sponsors.
</P>
<P>
The nine earlier meetings had been held in the developed world,
the last one at San Franciso of the United States in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing tenth conference will provide a forum for
discussions of the latest advances in immunology in six plenary
lectures, 25 symposia and 86 interactive workshops covering a wide
array of topics including the emerging technology of edible
vaccines for infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>
Novel vaccines from plants, gene therapy, new methods for
control of AIDS and the latest research on allergic diseases like
asthma are among the topics to be discussed during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 500 distinguished scientists are scheduled to speak on
their fields of work in the symposia, workshops and the plenary
sessions, making it one of the greatest scientific events.

<HEADLINE> Southern African States Set to Get Normal Rains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 1 (Xinhua) -- As the rain season approaches,
most of southern African countries are set to receive normal
rainfall, the Sunday Mail reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Weather experts at a recent southern African regional climate
outlook forum meeting in Harare discussed likelihood of rainfall
distribution in southern Africa based on probabilities. The
climate outlook forum was convened to formulate consensus
guidance for the October 1998 to March 1999 rainfall season in
southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
A statement of the forum said: "the highest probabilities for
above normal rainfall are in the south-eastern part of the
sub-continent while the north-eastern part of the region should
expect normal to below normal rainfall conditions during the
period October this year to March next year."
</P>
<P>
The meteorologists agreed that October this year to March next
year constitute an important rainfall season over southern
Africa.
</P>
<P>
The forum predicted that there is a high probability of below
normal rainfall over eastern Tanzania over the period from
October to December. West and central Tanzania, northern Zambia,
the northern half of Malawi and Mauritius have high probabilities
of normal to below normal rainfall. The same is expected over
the northern part of Mozambique, southern half of Malawi and
central Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Southern Zambia, the southern half of Malawi, central
Mozambique and most of Zimbabwe have enhanced probabilities of
near normal rainfall. The south-western portion of Zimbabwe,
Botswana, the southern part of Mozambique, Swaziland, central and
eastern South Africa and northern Namibia have enhanced
probabilities of normal to above-normal rainfall.
</P>
<P>
Between January and March next year, the rest of the
sub-continent, excluding parts of Tanzania, is expected to have
normal to above-normal rainfall.
</P>
<P>
Last year, most farmers in the region either delayed their
planting or reduced their hectarage after the widely publicized
El Nino phenomenon that usually brings drought to the region.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean, Namibian, Angolan Leaders Meet in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of Zimbabwe, Namibia
and Angola will hold a one-day summit Sunday in Lubumbashi of
Democratic Congo (DRC) to review the situation in the central
African country, the Zimbabwe News Agency Ziana reported.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, Namibian President Sam
Nujoma and Angolan President Eduardo dos Santos are expected to
attend the summit as they have now arrived in the second largest
city of Lubumbashi in southern Congo (K).
</P>
<P>
The three countries have deployed troops to assist Congolese
President Laurent Kabila in fighting a three-month rebellion led
by minority Congolese Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
Sources said the meeting had been called by Nujoma to review a
hasty advance into eastern Congo where rebels claim control of a
third of the country and look set to fight on following collapsed
peace efforts recently in Lusaka, Ziana reported.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe, together with the other allied forces has already
indicated that they will deploy more troops to help Kabila win
back the east especially the recently captured strategic town of
Kindu.
</P>
<P>
After the Lusaka talks on Congo (K), Mugabe has said the only
way toward bringing peace and stability to Congo is to intensify
the activities of the allied forces.
</P>
<P>
"The way forward is to continue to defend the DRC vigorously,
which we are doing, and knock sense into the minds of those who
are intransigent," Mugabe said, referring to Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Kabila and his three allies accuse Kigali of invading to back
the Congolese Rebels to occupy large tracts of territory in
eastern Congo, but Rwanda denies direct involvement.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe recently sent reinforcement of 2,000 troops to Congo
and it is now estimated to have more than 6,000 soldiers in Congo
(K).

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Swedish King Carl XVI Gustaf
and Queen Silvia Gustaf XVI will start a four-day visit to
Mozambique Tuesday at the invitation of Mozambican President
Joaquim Chissano, an official from Swedish Embassy said here.
</P>
<P>
The King told reporters the other day in Stockholm that he
wanted to see with his own eyes the recent changes in Mozambique
after it gained peace in 1992.
</P>
<P>
He said, Mozambique had been a friendly country with Sweden in
the colonial times, especially after 1964 when the Mozambican
people started their struggle for national independence.
</P>
<P>
The two countries established official bilateral relations
after Mozambique gained independence in 1975.
</P>
<P>
Sources from Swedish Foreign Ministry said Mozambique is the
number one country which Sweden aids. In 1997 Sweden granted
about 52.56 million U.S. Dollars to Mozambique. This year the
aid will reach 67.14 million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Sweden is aiding 13 projects in the southern
African country which covers mainly education, agriculture,
energy, industry, culture and public administration sectors.

<HEADLINE> 27 Hutu Militia Die in Attack on Kigali Rural </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Thirty people, 27 armed Hutu
infiltrators and three civilians were killed in a prefecture in
Kigali Rural last Sunday following an attack on a local camp of
displaced persons (IDPs), and a health center.
</P>
<P>
"The incident took place in Rushashi and Musasa commune, about
60 kilometers north of the capital Kigali,'' Gasamagera (one
name), an official in the area, told Rwanda News Agency (RNA)
this Sunday.
</P>
<P>
At Musasa, a large group of armed Hutu militiamen who had
crossed from Ruhengeri into Rushashi, tried to raid a camp of
IDPs at Coko trading center, RNA quoted him as saying in a
special report to Xinhua based here in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
The infiltrators killed three civilians and looted the local
health center, and tried to return to where they come from. But
the IDPs alerted villages from neighboring villages who
immediately started a hot pursuit of the militiamen.
</P>
<P>
The villagers, without any help from the army reportedly
succeeded in encircling the attackers. The angry mob killed 27 of
the militiamen, and captured a good number of others, Gasmagera
claimed.
</P>
<P>
State-run radio Rwanda reported that six assault rifles were
also seized by the villagers.
</P>
<P>
"This is a sign that the population is disassociating
themselves from the extremists,'' Gasamagera claimed, adding that
in Rushashi commune, about 200 residents who were collaborating
with the infiltrators in acts of insecurity including killings,
burning houses and vehicles in the past, have surrendered to
government officials.
</P>
<P>
The sous-prefecture of Murambi under attack has been in the
the past the scene of bloody raids by armed Hutu extremists which
since July has claimed the lives of nearly 200 people, and
destroyed many economic infrastructures, the RNA report said.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Calls for Battle Against Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At a special memorial service in the Knesset (Parliament),
Netanyahu said that there should be no room for violence of any
kind in Israel's political life.
</P>
<P>
He said it was no secret that he disagreed with the government
of Rabin over the Oslo peace accords, but stressed that both their
goals were to achieve lasting peace for Israel.
</P>
<P>
The most important thing, he emphasized, was that disputes
over political issues should be resolved without violence.
</P>
<P>
Peace must first be made between "brothers," Netanyahu said in
the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
The Knesset memorial service was a part of nation-wide
activities to pay tribute to Rabin, who was murdered by a
rightist Jew in 1995, two years after he signed the historic Oslo
Accords with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
National flags were lowered to half mast in government
institutions and military bases. University students halted
demonstrations which have lasted for several days over tuition
fees, and a state memorial service was held at Mount Herzl, where
the slain prime minister lies in rest.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's appeal echoed his earlier remarks made in a weekly
cabinet meeting, in which he called on all political wings of
Israel to battle violence.
</P>
<P>
Many people note that since the assassination of Rabin three
years ago, the political atmosphere in Israel has not changed
much. The country is still widely divided, and the elements of
extremism still exist as demonstrated by recent wild incitement
campaigns against Netanyahu after he signed a land-for-peace deal
with Arafat last month.
</P>
<P>
Recent polls have showed that more than 60 percent of the
Israelis believe that no lessons have been learnt from the
tragedy of Rabin, and almost half of the Israelis said there is a
high chance for another political assassination.

<HEADLINE> Israel Urged to Halt Settlement Activity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian chief negotiator
Saeb Erekat on Sunday urged Israel to halt housing construction in
Ras Al-Amud in East Jerusalem and give peace a chance.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh, Erekat
said the attempt to start housing construction in Ras Al-Amud by a
group of Jewish people is a blatant violation to the signed peace
agreements which prohibit unilateral measures.
</P>
<P>
Erekat called for immediate measures by the Israeli government
to stop the settlement activities in Ras Al-Amud, reported
Jerusalem Media and Communication Center, a Palestinian media
center based in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, a group of Jewish people tried to start housing
construction in Ras Al-Amud, a Palestinian Arab quarter in East
Jerusalem. Their activities were stopped by Jerusalem police amid
protests by representatives of Israel's peace group Peace Now and
other Palestinian officials.
</P>
<P>
Conflicts also erupted on Sunday at the scene when a number of
Peace Now members tried to move away the fence set up days ago by
a group of Israeli Knesset (parliament) right-wing members. As a
result, three Peace Now members were arrested by police.
</P>
<P>
Israel's Prime Minister's Office said Sunday that although
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not issue his permit for
housing construction in Ras Al-Amud, the fence placed there is
legal and nobody is allowed to move them.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side has strongly opposed such a move, stating
East Jerusalem is part of the occupied territory and the Israeli
side has no right to build any house there.
</P>
<P>
Some four months ago, Israel's Jerusalem municipality issued
permits to build 132 departments for Jewish housing on an empty
plot in Ras Al-Amud, which is said to be owned by American
millionaire Irving Moskowitz.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Deputy PM Meets Russia's Zhirinovsky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz met here Sunday with Vladimir Zhirinovsky, chairman of
the Russian Liberal Democratic Party, the Iraqi News Agency (INA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
Zhirinovsky arrived here Sunday with a Russian Duma (low house
of parliament) delegation led by Duma Vice-Chairman Mikhail
Gutsiriyev.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Aziz lauded the stand taken by the Russian
government and Duma on the Iraqi issue and stressed Iraq's desire
to promote relations with Russia, said INA.
</P>
<P>
Aziz praised Zhirinovsky for supporting Iraq's demands of
lifting the United Nations embargo imposed on Iraq after its
invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Affirming his full support for Iraq, Zhirinovsky called on the
Russian government and "all the fair people" to work for the
lifting of the eight-year-old embargo.
</P>
<P>
INA reported on Friday that the Russian Duma delegation would
discuss with Iraqi officials on means of helping lift the embargo.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi leadership on Saturday decided to halt all forms of
cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) for
disarmament in Iraq until the U.N. Security Council considers the
lifting of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council on Saturday unanimously condemned
the Iraqi decision and urged Iraq to rescind the decision
"immediately and unconditionally."
</P>
<P>
The embargo cannot be lifted until U.N. arms inspectors verify
that Iraq has eliminated all its weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has long blamed the United States and "its agents" in
UNSCOM for blocking the lifting of the sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Warns Against Connecting Cyprus Problem to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Foreign Minister
Ioannis Kasoulides has warned that any effort to associate a
settlement to the Cyprus problem with the republic's European
Union (EU) accession course would make a Cyprus solution
impossible.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides made the remarks Sunday at Larnaca Airport prior to
his departure for Athens, the first stop in his tour of European
countries to discuss Cyprus' efforts to join the EU and
developments in the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on efforts by some EU member states to associate
the Cyprus question to its EU course, Kasoulides said that "any
connection of the Cyprus problem to the accession course will
signal the end of efforts to settle the Cyprus issue."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unresolved despite the
international community's peace efforts in the past 24 years.
</P>
<P>
"If the Cyprus problem and the EU accession course are
officially associated, this would constitute an invitation to
Turkey not to allow a settlement," Kasoulides explained.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister added that in the meantime, such a stance
would not facilitate EU efforts to bring Turkey closer to Europe.
</P>
<P>
"As the EU itself has stated, the Cyprus issue is one of the
important obstacles in forging closer ties with Turkey," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus submitted its application for EU membership in 1990. The
EU started accession talks with Cyprus in March this year.
</P>
<P>
On his scheduled meeting in the Greek capital of Athens with
Greek Foreign Ministry officials, Kasoulides said it is to be held
within the framework of regular contacts between the two
governments.
</P>
<P>
He said that he will discuss "the situation in the Cyprus
problem and Cyprus' EU accession course" with Greek officials.
</P>
<P>
After his meeting in Athens, Kasoulides will visit Spain and
Britain. On November 8, he will fly to Brussels where he will
represent the Cypriot government in the start of substantive
accession talks with the EU.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's Trade Deficit Up This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's trade deficit surged by
33.89 percent in the first seven months this year compared with
the same period of 1997, an official report said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The report issued by the Cabinet Information and Decision
Support Center said the deficit was 24.18 billion Egyptian pounds
(7.11 billion U.S. dollars) this year, 6.12 billion pounds (1.8
billion dollars) more than that from January to July last year.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the deficit rise to the drop in exports
and increase in imports.
</P>
<P>
Egypt exported 6.13 billion pounds (1.8 billion dollars) worth
of goods in the first seven months this year, registering a fall
of 1.61 billion pounds (474 million dollars), while the imports
rose by 17.48 percent to 30.31 billion pounds (8.91 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Exports of manufactured and semi-manufactured goods were 3.459
billion pounds (1.02 billion dollars), compared with 3.604 billion
pounds (1.06 billion dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
Raw materials and cotton exports amounted to 774 million pounds
(228 million dollars), 2 million pounds (588,000 dollars) less
than those in the same period last year.

<HEADLINE> CBI Survey Highlights Risk of Taking UK into </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BIRMINGHAM, November 1 (Xinhua) - Many British companies are
more confident about their own prospects than they are about the
UK economy as a whole, according to a survey of economic
conditions carried out by the Confederation of British Industry
(CBI).
</P>
<P>
The overwhelming majority also believe the Monetary Policy
Committee (MPC) should cut rates on Thursday, with over half
wanting a cut of 0.5 percent, the CBI said.
</P>
<P>
The survey, released at the CBI's National Conference here
Sunday afternoon, covers macro-economic conditions and business
attitudes to recent labor market legislation.
</P>
<P>
When asked if they were more optimistic or pessimistic for
their own businesses in 1999 as compared with 1998, 19 percent
said they were more optimistic while 47 percent said they were
more pessimistic.
</P>
<P>
And at least a quarter of firms indicate that they plan to
increase their number of employees, and their levels of
investment, next year.
</P>
<P>
But when asked the same question for the UK as a whole, only
two percent said they were optimistic, while 83 percent thought
the UK economy would perform worse next year.
</P>
<P>
Introducing the results, Adair Turner, CBI Director-General,
said: "The fact that so many more firms are concerned about the
overall economy than for their own prospects highlights the danger
of talking too much about recession."
</P>
<P>
"Many people clearly believe things will get worse but not for
them - perhaps because they are alarmed by media hype about global
meltdown," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, Turner admitted: "This is clearly a very difficult
time for some key sectors and we do expect a sharp economic
slowdown."

<HEADLINE> Labor Government Must Avoid Burdening Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BIRMINGHAM, November 1 (Xinhua) - Tax and administrative
burdens on companies have risen over the past year and are hurting
business competitiveness at a time when the economy is facing a
downturn, according to the Confederation of British Industry
(CBI).
</P>
<P>
Chancellor Gordon Brown must not add to them in his next budget
and where possible should look to cut business taxes to promote
innovation and entrepreneurship, it argues.
</P>
<P>
In its recommendations to the Chancellor in advance of the
Pre-Budget Report on Tuesday, the CBI states that taxes on
business have been pushed up by over 5 billion pounds a year
during 1997/8 - 2001/01, due to the part two budgets, and by over
8 billion pounds a year as a result of successive budgets since
1993.
</P>
<P>
Added to this the cost of complying with tax and other business
regulations increasingly a major cause of concern, the CBI adds.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the start of the CBI's National Conference Sunday
afternoon, Clive Thompson, CBI President, said: "There is a real
danger that the burden of all this tax and regulation will move
business further away from its real business - wealth creation."
</P>
<P>
"The sheer volume of tax - 20 billion pounds over the next four
years - and the administrative burden created by complex tax
proposals, are adding both to uncertainty and workloads," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Another senior official from the CBI also said: "It is essential
that no additional tax or administrative burdens are placed on
business if we are to avoid a further reduction in our
effectiveness."

<HEADLINE> Sound Public Finances Underpin Spending Plans for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BIRMINGHAM, November 1 (Xinhua) - The Government's
Comprehensive Spending Review plans are not under threat from
short term economic pressures, according to the Confederation of
British Industry (CBI).
</P>
<P>
But there is still the challenge of developing a long-term
strategy for coping with rising demands on key public services, it
adds.
</P>
<P>
The CBI believes the UK public finances are in a fundamentally
sound condition, following five years of sustained fiscal
consolidation. The public/debt GDP ratio is at a reasonable
sustainable level, and the public deficit close to balance.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the CBI's National Conference here Sunday
afternoon, Kate Barker, Chief Economic Advisor, said: "This sound
position is not put at risk by the public spending increase
announced for the next three years."
</P>
<P>
However, she stressed: "The Government must ensure that value
for money is obtained for the extra spending granted to
departments."
</P>
<P>
The principal concern is the longer-term trend. Public spending
as a percentage of GDP is set to rise and it is essential that
this trend does not go any further, with pressure for improved
health and education likely to continue, said, Kate Barker.
</P>
<P>
"Of more concern is the need for the Government to demonstrate
it will 'think the unthinkable' in order to contain long term
public finances," she added.

<HEADLINE> Blair: It Is Time to Improve British-German Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 1 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
has declared that London would grasp the opportunity of the recent
power change in Bonn to foster new political relations between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
In an article contributed to the German Sunday newspaper Welt
am Sonntag ahead of a visit to London by Germany's new chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder, Blair noted that Germany, not the Commonwealth
or the United States, was now the most important trading partner
of Britain.
</P>
<P>
"The politics follows the trade... Therefore I believe that it
is time to change the political relations between our two
countries in order to match it with the increasingly closer
economic relations as well as personal contacts," Blair said.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the similarity between the policies pursued Germany's
new Social Democratic government under Schroeder and his Labour
government, Blair said that what Schroeder called "the New Center"
and what he called "the Third Way" was "a modernized Social
Democracy which combines efficiency and entrepreneurship with
social justice and fairness".
</P>
<P>
"With the election of Schroeder a new generation has taken over
power in a new center-left Europe," Blair declared.
</P>
<P>
Taking care not to arouse fears from Paris, Blair stressed that
Britain was determined to be a leading partner in Europe, but
would not in the meantime threaten the relations between Germany
and France.
</P>
<P>
"We want to enrich the European Union (EU) and show what
contributions can be made by a Britain that oriented itself
positively towards Europe," Blair said.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder, who just took office last week to replace the
conservative government under the veteran chancellor Helmut Kohl,
will meet Blair on Monday on his first official visit to Britain
as German chancellor.
</P>
<P>
According to Blair, he and Schroeder would discuss how London
and Bonn could better cooperate on European issues such as
fighting unemployment, EU reforms and its eastward enlargement.
</P>
<P>
They would also discuss how Europe could play a bigger role in
international affairs, Blair said.
</P>
<P>
"The NATO should remain as the foundation of the collective
security in Europe. But in the meanwhile, Europe, as a supplement
to the alliance, should be in a position to act credibly under its
own initiative even at times when the United States do not support
us," the British leader said in the article.

<HEADLINE> Tunis Stock Exchange Index Rebounds Last Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The main indicators of the Tunis
stock market last week were characterized by a general retreat on
the one hand and rebound of the price index after a slump in the
previous week.
</P>
<P>
The turnover last week stood at 3.7 million dinars (about 3.2
million U.S. dollars), less than a quarter of 17.8 million dinars
(about 15.48 million dollars) in the previous week.
</P>
<P>
The number of shares that changed hands went down also to
200,000 shares from 900,000 shares due to the absence of major
exceptional transactions and the weak trading level at the bourse,
according to the weekly bulletin of the exchange.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the share prices of many firms last week were better
than the previous one. The improvement reflected on the main price
index that rose by 0.25 percent last week to close at 464.63
points, compared with 463.48 in the previous week that lost 7
points.

<HEADLINE> Syria Ready to Resume Talks With Israel: Mubarak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
said Sunday that Syria is willing to resume talks with Israel by
picking up from where they left off.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after meeting with visiting Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad, Mubarak blamed Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu for rejecting Syria's offer.
</P>
<P>
He called on Netanyahu to "create the right atmosphere for
confidence-building" in a bid to dispel Syria's distrust of his
Likud government.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli talks came to a halt in early 1996 due to
disputes over the future of the Golan Heights captured by Israel
from Syria in the 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
Syria argued that the former Israeli Labor government has
agreed to a pullback from the Golan Heights and that the
negotiations should be resumed from that point. But Netanyahu
insists that the talks start from zero.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak also urged Syria and Turkey to continue solving
disputes through negotiations now that they have settled some of
the problems.
</P>
<P>
Ankara threatened military actions last month to stop what it
denounced as Damascus' support for the Kurdish rebels seeking an
independent state in the southeast of Turkey, sparking fears of a
regional conflict.
</P>
<P>
Mediated by Egypt and Iran, Syria agreed on October 20 to stop
sheltering the Kurdish rebels and not to allow cross-border
attacks on Turkey by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
On the recent interim peace accord between the Palestinians and
Israelis, Mubarak said that Egypt has no objection to the deal as
long as the Palestinians have accepted it. He called for full
implementation of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Netanyahu signed the
agreement on October 23 in Washington on Israeli further pullback
from the West Bank and the Palestinians' crackdown on Islamic
extremists.
</P>
<P>
Al-Assad arrived in the Egyptian Red Sea resort Sharm el Sheikh
in the day for a regular coordination of stances on regional
issues with Mubarak. He left for home after the summit.

CAIRO, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Egypt ordered Sunday the remand
of 28 members of the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood for 15 days
pending investigations, Egypt's Middle East News Agency (MENA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
The arrestees will face charges of association with an illegal
group, possession of written materials against the state and
inciting anti-government demonstrations, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
They were also accused of trying to revive activities of a
banned organization and reshape its secret structures in several
governorates.
</P>
<P>
The defendants include a physician, a pharmacist, two civil
engineers and an unemployed university graduate.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt's largest Islamic fundamentalist
group, was banned in the 1950s, but was tolerated until 1995 when
the government began to crack down on it.
</P>
<P>
The group advocates an Islamic state in Egypt, but says it does
not believe violence is the way to bring that about.

<HEADLINE> Iran Concludes Maneuver on Afghanistan Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian army on Monday
concluded its biggest ever military maneuver on the country's
eastern border with Afghanistan, the official Islamic Republic
News Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the end of the maneuver, the army commander Major
General Ali Shahbazi termed the Zulfaqar-2 military exercises as
"fruitful and positive."
</P>
<P>
He said that in the final stage of the exercises which was
launched Monday morning, fighter bombers of the air force zeroed
in on the positions of the mock enemy and the infantry and armored
units supported by air forces achieved pre-determined targets.
</P>
<P>
Shahbazi said that clearing operations by the chemical units
and installation of suspended bridge for the passage of tanks
were also among exercises completed in the war games.
</P>
<P>
Following the fighters raid on positions of hypothetical enemy
and assault of the infantry and armored units, strongholds and
equipments of the mock enemy were destroyed and bellows of smoke
covered the sky of operational theater, IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
Brigadier General Fazlollah Shahinrad, head of the board for
monitoring and evaluating the maneuvers, also told IRNA that all
stages of the military war games were conducted timely and
precisely according to pre-arranged schedules.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the maneuver, he cautioned border dwellers of the
security of the region and warned smugglers and "agents of global
arrogance" that they would be faced with strong reaction of the
Iranian army in case of any provocative measure.
</P>
<P>
Shahinrad said that as long as the concern of acts of
sedition and lack of security in the region exists, the forces
deployed during the maneuver will remain on eastern borders.
</P>
<P>
The Zulfaqar-2 maneuver with the participation of 200,000
troops was kicked off Saturday night in an area of 5,000 square
kilometers along Iran's eastern border with Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The maneuver was scheduled to be held at the end of September
amid tensions between Iran and the Afghan Taliban militia, who
killed eight Iranian diplomats and a reporter in northern
Afghanistan in August.
</P>
<P>
The war game was postponed after the United Nations Secretary
General's special envoy on Afghan affairs launched a mediation
mission to defuse the tensions between the two neighbors.

European Union in the Pak-India dialogue process to bring about a
lasting and durable peace in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the first Pak-German dialogue at the Institute of

sincerity of purpose, has resumed the dialogue process with India
for the resolution of all outstanding problems including the core
issue of Kashmir, according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
The Kashmir issue has been bedeviling bilateral relations
between the two countries as well as vitiating environment of
peace and security in South Asia, Wasim said.
</P>
<P>
"If only India could be persuaded by third parties to show a
flexible and innovative attitude on the core issue, I have no
doubt that we can then move easily to expand ties in other fields
as well," said the chairman.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to emphasize our resolve for peace and security
in the nuclearized South Asia," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that "we appreciate the understanding of the
European Union towards the compulsions which led to our nuclear
tests and growing realization of an urgent need for an early
resolution of the Kashmir issue."

WASHINGTON, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The NBA lockout entered its
fifth month with both sides ready to resume bargaining on the
week the regular season was supposed to begin.
</P>
<P>
League and union lawyers are to meet in New York today, with
the full negotiating teams to meet Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The season was supposed to begin Tuesday night, but the first
month of the schedule has been wiped out because of the work
stoppage. More cancellations are certain if an agreement isn't
reached by next weekend.
</P>
<P>
"This thing is pretty much in David Stern's hands, and I'm not
unduly optimistic," said agent Steve Kaufman, a member of the
union's agents advisory committee.
</P>
<P>
The sides made more progress last week than they had in the
previous 4 1/2 months, agreeing on a loose framework for a
collective bargaining agreement.
</P>

<P>
DHAKA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh Foreign Minister Abdus
Samad Azad Monday said at a press briefing that the second summit
of the D-8 will be held in Dhaka sometime in March next year.

<HEADLINE> Canadians Oppose Trafficking in Personal Information </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Nine in 10 Canadians strongly
disapprove of companies traficking in information about their
private lives, according to a survey published Monday.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether it is acceptable for companies to sell,
trade or share detailed lists of personal information to other
organizations, 23 percent respondents said it is "not very
acceptable" and 65 percent said it is "not at all acceptable."
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that 80 percent of the respondents think
personal data should be kept strictly confidential, unless the
information is needed for medical emergencies or to enforce the
law.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted between July 15 and 21 by polling firm
Angus Reid Group, has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.5
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
At present, there is no law in Canada that ensures consumer
privacy and regulates how information about consumers is collected
and used in private sector, according to the Globe and Mail
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the government proposed a federal privacy bill that
outlines how organizations should deal with personal consumer
information.
</P>
<P>
The bill is expected to be fast-tracked through the system as
concerns about electronic privacy continues to mount, the paper
said.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Approves Draft National Water Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's National Water
Resources Council (NWRC) Monday approved the country's first ever
draft national water policy which envisages appropriate use of
water without jeopardizing the interest of any member of society,
the official BSS news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The approval was given at NWRC's 4th meeting held with Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina in the chair.
</P>
<P>
As a riverine country the importance of water resource is
immense in the national life, Hasina said. "Water is resource for
us and at the same time a cause of sorrow and grief also," she
said, adding that through proper harnessing, storage and
utilization, "we have to ensure the best and optimum use of these
precious resources."
</P>
<P>
She particularly underlined the importance of protecting the
natural water reservoirs so that the local condition and
environment are not disturbed.
</P>
<P>
The draft policy was totally enunciated by the local water
resource persons and water experts without any help from foreign
consultants, Water Resources Minister Abdur Razzak said while
presenting the policy.
</P>
<P>
The policy, which will act as a future guideline for proper
water management, incorporates all aspects of availability,
storage and utilization of rain water, surface water and ground
water and their sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
Besides, it has also laid emphasis on both public and private
actions for ensuring optimal development of water resources that
benefits both individual and society at large, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The main objectives of the policy are to redress issues related
to the harnessing and development of all forms of surface water
and ground water and management of these resources in an efficient
and equitable manner and ensure the availability of water to all
sections of society.
</P>
<P>
The highlights of the policy are: to develop a state of
knowledge and capability that will enable the country to design
future water resources management plans by itself with economic
efficiency, gender equality, social, justice and environmental
awareness and to facilitate achievement of the water management
objectives through broad public participation.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Police Shoot Rioting Youth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Zambian police Monday morning
shot dead a youth in Luansha, a mining town about 360 kilometers
north of Lusaka, to squelch a rioting over miners' salaries and
housing allowance.
</P>
<P>
This was the first death recorded since the rioting began last
Tuesday at Roan Antelope Mining Corporation of Zambia (RAMCZ)
based in Luansha.
</P>
<P>
The boy was shot by police at the back of his head and the
brain was splashed on the spot in the city centre, the Zambia
News Agency ZANA reported.
</P>
<P>
Most of the youths from the mine township had a running battle
Monday morning with the police and shifted the war from the
townships to the town center.
</P>
<P>
The strike at the mining company entered its six day with the
miners vowing that they would not resume work until their demands
to get their September salaries, 25 percent housing allowance and
to remove their land rates being charged by the mines, are met.
</P>
<P>
The tense situation in Luansha resulted in shop owners closing
their shops for fear of looting and parents going to schools to
fetch their children.
</P>
<P>
By 11:00 hours (local time), the town was abandoned and only
police vehicles were patrolling the area, said ZANA.
</P>
<P>
In the past days, hundreds of miners accompanied by their
wives and children have looted the mine police office, destroyed
a number of clubs and smashed several vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Management at RAMCZ Sunday resolved with the union officials
that the miners get back to work and be paid their salaries, but
the uncompromising workers refused to budge.
</P>
<P>
In a response to the strike, Zambian Deputy Minister of Mines,
Kaunda Lembalemba, threatened Sunday that the government would be
forced to intervene in the wrangling at the mining company if the
union and the management could not resolve their dispute within
48 hours.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Print More Money Against Millennium Bug Panic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Canada plans to
print extra bank notes in the coming year, anticipating a run on
cash by people living in fear of the year 2000 computer bug.
</P>
<P>
A number of banks are expecting that nervous customers will
sock away more bills than usual as the new millennium approaches.
</P>
<P>
"I think people might think it is prudent to hold a bit more
cash," a Bank of Canada spokesman said. "We are, as other central
banks, looking ahead and saying there could be some additional
demands as Y2K (the year 2000) approaches."
</P>
<P>
The bank said it is still in the "early days" of determining
how much money will be needed.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian central bank is not alone in its decision to print
more money as Y2K approaches. It was reported that the Bank of
England will run off extra cash in the run-up to January 2000.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Federal Reserve Board also announced last month it
will have an extra 50 billion U.S. dollars in cash on hand, just
in case there is a run on money.
</P>
<P>
The computer problem posed by the arrival of the year 2000 is
that the systems have no way of expressing a date past year-end
1999. It will particularly pose substantial risks to all financial
institutions.

CAIRO, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel's foreign currency reserves rose 129
million U.S. dollars in October to 21.94 billion dollars, the
Bank of Israel said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The foreign currency market was very active in October as the
shekel depreciated 10.5 percent against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel's internal revenues will this year show an
8 billion shekels (1.84 billion U.S. dollars) shortfall "at the
very least," officials from the Finance Ministry said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, some 4.7 billion shekels (1.08 billion dollars) is
offset by a reduction in government expenditure in the wake of
the economic slowdown, while the remainder is principally the
result of a lack of activity in the construction industry and a
substantial fall in the number of vehicle imports.
</P>
<P>
JEDDA -- Well-informed sources anticipate that the four
principal electricity companies in Saudi Arabia will merge,
together with other companies and the General Electricity
Authority, into one holding company under the name of "Saudi
Arabian Electricity Company" before 1999.
</P>
<P>
The four principal companies are the "Central," the "Western,"
the "Eastern" and the "Southern" companies.
</P>
<P>
RABAT -- The World Bank has granted Yemen 14 million dollars
in subsidy to finance part of the projected restoration of the old
city at Fez which the UNESCO classifies as world human heritage,
its history dating back to the 18th century.
</P>
<P>
A World Bank official told the Arabic newspaper Al Hayat in an
interview published Monday that a similar subsidy will go to the
old city at Soweira overlooking the Atlantic Ocean to preverve its
heritage.

<HEADLINE> IBF To Question Indonesian Shuttler in Doping Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The International Badminton
Federation (IBF) will meet world doubles champion shuttler Sigit
Budiarto of Indonesia in Singapore in a investigation about a
doping charge against him, an IBF spokesman told reporters here Mo
nday.
</P>
<P>
Justian Suhandinata, the IBF vice president, said the meeting
would take place in the mid-November in Singapore where the IBF
would be represented by amongst others Jeff Robson, Punch Gunalan
and Dr. Myalaysin while Sigit would be accompanied by Agus
Wirahadikusumah, MF Siregar and Dr. Michael Triangto.
</P>
<P>
Sigit allegedly took a forbidden drug before playing in a
Singapore Open event.
</P>
<P>
The meeting would be a follow-up on the evaluation the IBF had
made on the results of a doping test conducted on Sigit at a
laboratory in Beijing, China, on October 22 last year.
</P>
<P>
"The test showed a sample of Sigit's urine to positively
contain nandrolone", Justian said, adding that at the meeting in
Singapore, Sigit would among other things be asked where or from
whom he had obtained the drug.
</P>
<P>
About the punishment Sigit could receive, Justian said it
would be a maximum of two years' suspension, but extenuating
circumstances could be considered to lighten it.
</P>
<P>
"Sigit's punishment could be reduced, for instance, if he
confesses to have unintentionally taken the drug, or if it's
proven the IBF had failed to properly inform athletes on what
drugs fall within the doping category," he said.

BEIJING, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The Balanced Fertilization
Project funded by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP)
has helped targeted areas in China increase grain output by 2.42
million tons and raise farmers' total income by 1.52 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The project, initiated in 1992, has been carried out on 600,000
hectares of farmland in seven provinces, according to an
international balanced fertilization seminar which opened today in
the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in targeted areas are paying greater attention to the
scientific and efficient use of fertilizers. Statistics for 1997
show that the fertilizers use rate in the areas stood at 37.3
percent, up 8.2 percentage points on the 1992 level, equivalent to
increasing the use of fertilizers by 28.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The project has also provided valuable experience for spreading
technology. In 1995, the Ministry of Agriculture listed balanced
fertilization program as one of 10 key technology projects for
introduction nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Balanced fertilization has been introduced to over 20 million
hectares of farmland nationwide.

<HEADLINE> Guinea Bissau Peace Deal Signed in Abuja </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Opposing sides in Guinea
Bissau's five-month civil war have signed an agreement to end the
conflict in the West African country, official source in Abuja
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The peace deal was signed late Sunday night after talks in the
Nigerian capital between Guinea Bissau President Joao Bernardo
Vieira and the rebel leader Ansumane Mane.
</P>
<P>
The agreement calls for both parties to adhere to the
cease-fire signed in August, withdraw all foreign forces and
introduce a West African peace-keeping force.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, a government of national unity will be formed
within 10 days and presidential elections will be held no later
than March 1999.
</P>
<P>
Talks between the two sides started Thursday in Gambian
capital Banjul and restarted in Abuja where President Vieira was
attending the 21st Summit of the Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) from October 30-31.
</P>
<P>
The talks were brokered by Gambian President Yaya Jammeh.
</P>
<P>
Mane, former Chief of Army Staff, led a rebel against Vieira
in June after he was sacked for involvement of army officers in
arms smuggling.
</P>
<P>
Neighboring Senegal and Guinea sent troops to Vieira's aid,
but the rebel forces gained control over most of the country.
</P>
<P>
The conflicts have resulted in the displacement of about half
of Guinea Bissau's one million population.

<HEADLINE> China Anticipates New Securities Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The widely anticipanted first
securities law is expected to win the approval of China's highest
legislative body within this year, according to a renowned Chinese
economist.
</P>
<P>
Li Yining, a member of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress (NPC), participated in drafting the law and
pointed out that members of the NPC Standing Committee reached a
consensus on major issues following heated rounds of serious
debates and discussions. Li made the comments during a Monday
interview with the Xinhua News Agency and added the legislature
will quite likely pass the law during its December session.
</P>
<P>
He pointed to the securities market as an indispensable part of
China's socialist market economy, and noted that timely
promulgation of the law is needed to ensure the healthy
development of both the economy and market itself.
</P>
<P>
The first draft of the law was submitted to the NPC Standing
Committee for deliberation in 1993 and had simply been tabled for
four years prior to this year's current committee session.
</P>
<P>
Li, who also serves as deputy director of the NPC's Economic
and Financial Committee, stressed that differences of opinion
largely center on issues concerning the securities management
system, the range and scope of the law, spot and futures
transactions, and business lineages of securities companies.
</P>
<P>
Most legislators agree that the securities management system
should be subject to the dual leadership of the central and local
governments.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that the draft fails to cover futures trading.
However, according to Li, "that is in no way tantamount to a ban
on futures trading."
</P>
<P>
He admitted that the draft law is far from perfect since the
securities market is highly complicated, and it is extremely
difficult to establish concrete guidelines for various activities
such as off-market trading and the approval system for companies
intending to float shares.
</P>
<P>
China's securities law should eventually be in line with the
laws of other countries, "but the proper conditions do not as yet
exist," said Li.
</P>
<P>
He warned that bad debts held by banks, the decline in the
quality of listed companies and illegal fund-raising activities
are posing grave challenges to the country's young securities
market.
</P>
<P>
"The Securities Law will, at least to some extent, help reduce
market risk, but will in no way solve all existing problems," said
Li.

<HEADLINE> Mongolian Parliament Group Proposes Constitutional Amendment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, November 2 (Xinhua) -- A major parliamentary group
of Mongolia proposed Tuesday an amendment to the constitution to
end months of government crisis.
</P>
<P>
The group made the proposal in discussing a recent ruling made
by the constitutional court.
</P>
<P>
As set forth by the ruling, which analysts believed will fuel
the government crisis, it is illegal for the parliament members to
serve in the government.
</P>
<P>
However, under the parliamentary group's proposal, a provision
would be added to the constitution to allow members of the State
Great Hural, or parliament, to serve in the government.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia's constitution does not allow members of the Great
Hural to take positions other than those in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The MDU followed the rule in forming the government in 1996,
but argued later that it is essential for parliament members to
serve in the government, so as to secure the leading status of the
State Great Hural in the nation's political life.
</P>
<P>
The parliament therefore passed a constitutional amendment on
January 15, allowing its members to serve in the government.
</P>
<P>
The legislature then approved a government formed by all
parliament members and led by Tsakhiya Elbegdorj. But it dismissed
the government on July 24, starting months of government crisis.

<HEADLINE> Fighting Resumed in Somali Town of Kismayu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Heavy fighting resumed early
Monday morning in southern Somali town of Kismayu between the
Marehan clan militiamen and those of the Majerten dominating
forces loyal to General Mohamed Saeed Hirsi Morgan, said reports
from Kismayu.
</P>
<P>
According to VHF radio reports, the Majerten militiamen of
General Morgan Monday launched the attack against the positions
of the advancing Marehan fighters outside Kismayu after three
days of calmness in the area.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that General Morgan was forced to initiate
the aggression after the Marehans have captured two key new
positions near the airport and outside the northern end of the
town in the past two days.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Marehans said they have deployed 10 battle
wagons and nearly 300 strong militiamen near the airport in an
effort to ban all in and outgoing flights of the town.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Kimsmayu, flights carrying
militiamen from the central region of Mudug have been arriving in
Kismayu on small Cesna planes for restrengthening the Majerten
militiamen of General Morgan in Kismayu.
</P>
<P>
According to confirmed reports, two battle wagons belonging to
the Marehans have been captured by the Majerten clansmen as the
fighting got close to the entrance of Kismayu, some five km north
of the town.
</P>
<P>
Unconfirmed reports said the Marehans have captured four
battle wagons from General Morgan's side after the fighting has
escalated.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people mainly women and children were reported to
have fled their houses becuase of the fighting.
</P>
<P>
The fighting for the port of Kismayu, 500 km south of
Mogadishu, began two years ago after serious dispute has erupted
between the two Darod subclans of Marehan and Majerten over the
power sharing in the control of the main installations of
Kismayu, the air and seaports.
</P>
<P>
In a serious battle early May, the Marehan clansmen were
dislodged from their bases in and outside Kismayu by General
Morgan's mainly Majerten militiamen. After five months long
perparations, the Marehans now seem to be well organized and
determined to regain their positions.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Speaker Proposes to Cancel Rabin's Memorial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Knesset (Parliament)
Speaker Dan Tichon on Monday asked lawmakers to agree to cancel
the Knesset special memorial session for late Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin next year.
</P>
<P>
Tichon said in his proposal that Rabin's assassination has to
be remembered, but it was sad that the Knesset special session for
Rabin has been turned into a gathering of mutual attacks among
political parties.
</P>
<P>
Rabin, who inked the Oslo accords with the Palestinians, was
assassinated on November 4, 1995 in Tel Aviv by a right-wing
extremist opposed to the peace process. Various memorial
ceremonies were held across the country each year.
</P>
<P>
"The Knesset is a place for promoting democracy and a forum for
members from different parties to voice their concerns and views
which could be conducive to national interests and unity, but what
happened during Sunday's special session for Rabin deepened the
rift between the parties," Tichon was reported as saying.
</P>
<P>
During Sunday's Knesset session for Rabin, political party
leaders tried to send a message of unity, but their words were
drowned by their political division.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the session, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from
the right-wing Likud urged for national unity, but said that he
did not agree with Rabin on the Oslo accords, the cornerstone of
the Israeli-Palestinian peace making.
</P>
<P>
Labor Party leader Ehud Barak said the first lesson that
should be learned about Rabin's assassination is that "words can
kill," referring to what was called Netanyahu's anti-Rabin
incitement before the murder took place.
</P>
<P>
Meretz leader Yossi Darid delivered an emotional speech, in
which he accused the Netanyahu government of rejecting the Oslo
accords.
</P>
<P>
Leah Rabin, widow of the late prime minister, refused to have
any reconciliation with Netanyahu because the right-wingers are
still smearing Rabin for what they called the "terrible Oslo
accords."

<HEADLINE> Fresh Water Crisis Looming in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The swelling population in
Nigeria has forced the increase in water supply as water
availability is projected to shrink by more than half within the
next three decades, The Guardian newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Water supply in Nigeria is predicted to drop from 2,506 cubic
meters per year each person three years ago to 1,175 cubic meters
by the year 2025, when the population is estimated to increase
from 111.7 million in 1995 to 238.4 million.
</P>
<P>
The fresh water shortage in Nigeria is mainly caused by the
shrinkage of water supply in Lake Chad which is one of the
major fresh water sources in the West African country, according
to the paper.
</P>
<P>
Studies now confirm that Lake Chad on Nigeria's northeastern
tip has shrunk from a surface area of 25,000 square kilometers to
just 2,000 square kilometers due to over-use and drought over the
last three decades.
</P>
<P>
An international study conducted by the U.S.-based John
Kopkins University this year ranked Nigeria among countries which
could run out of water within the next three decades.
</P>
<P>
By 1995, the study said, some 31 countries with a combined
population of more than 458 million people were facing some
measure of water crisis.
</P>
<P>
The study noted that the number of people facing water crisis
is expected to swell to about 2.8 billion people spreading over
48 countries or up to one third of projected world population.
</P>
<P>
Three key factors are mainly blamed for the shrinking water
sources, namely, the swelling population, increased demand by
substantial growth in industrial, agricultural activities and
mass urbanization, and widespread of population of available
water resources, the paper said.

The administration also plans to spend the next two months in
an intensified effort to achieve this year's target for increasing
industrial and commercial tax revenues to 100 billion yuan (about

<HEADLINE> Israeli Soldiers Attack PNA Official in East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli soldiers on Monday
attacked a Palestinian cabinet minister and his body guards at
Ras Al-Amud of East Jerusalem, sources here said.
</P>
<P>
Faisal Husseini, Palestinian National Authority (PNA) minister
in charge of Jerusalem Affairs, and his body guards were staging a
sit-in at Ras Al-Amud against the construction there by a group of
Jewish people. Israeli soldiers beat them in an attempt to remove
them.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Israeli police at Ras Al-Amud prevented the Jewish
house builders from leveling the grounds there. But the builders
said on Monday that they have already received permission from the
Prime Minister's Office for house construction.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat on Sunday sent a
letter to Israel's Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh, urging Israel
to halt housing construction in Ras Al-Amud and give peace a
chance.
</P>
<P>
Erekat said in the letter that the planned construction in Ras
Al-Amud by a team of Jewish people is a blatant violation not only
of the Wye River Memorandum signed late last month, but also of
the Oslo Accords and the transitional agreements which stipulate
halting unilateral measures.
</P>
<P>
Conflicts also erupted on Sunday at Ras Al-Amud when several
members of Israeli Peace Now group tried to move away the fence
set up several days ago by a group of Israeli Knesset (parliament)
right-wing members. As a result, three Peace Now members were
arrested by police.
</P>
<P>
The planned housing construction in Ras Al-Amud has caused
another political dispute between the Palestinians and Israel. The
Palestinian side has strongly opposed such a move, stating that
East Jerusalem is part of the occupied territory and the Israeli
side has no right to build any house there.
</P>
<P>
Some four months ago, Israel's Jerusalem municipality issued
permits to build 132 departments for Jewish housing on an empty
plot in Ras Al-Amud, which is said to be owned by American
millionaire Irving Moskowitz.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Police Chief Orders Crackdown on Outlaws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Chief of the Indonesian Police
Lt. Gen. Roesmanhadi Monday ordered a crackdown on those who
commit unconstitutional acts that could undermine the country's
integrity.
</P>
<P>
The police will not take any risk by allowing outlawed groups
to carry out their actions, Roesmanhadi said in a written speech
read in Palembang, capital of South Sumatra province, before
security personnel tasked to safeguard this province during the
special session of the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR).
</P>
<P>
The MPR is scheduled to hold a special session on November 10
to 13 in Jakarta to discuss next year's general, presidential and
vice presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Various parties in the country have been at odds over the need
for the event, with some demanding that it be canceled. Student
protests flared again in the capital last week, demanding the
resignation of President B.J. Habibie and saying the special
session of MPR should not go ahead.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Roesmanhadi said the economic crisis has led to
a rise in the incidence of crime and social unrest in many parts
of the country.
</P>
<P>
However, such crimes as killings, kidnappings and riots, which
have caused huge losses, were not purely triggered by the crisis,
he was quoted by Antara News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that these destructive actions can never solve the
country's economic difficulties but will only make the people
suffer all the more.
</P>
<P>
The country must thus find constructive solutions to the
crisis, he added.

<HEADLINE> Chinese NPC Chairman Meets With Belgian Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese top legislator Li Peng,
during a meeting with visiting Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc
Dehaene here today, said that China values the role of the
European Union (EU) and is ready to further its ties with EU on
the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-Existence.
</P>
<P>
Li, chairman of China's National People's Congress (NPC)
Standing Committee, said that China and Belgium have maintained a
good momentum of development in bilateral relations over the past
years, with fruitful results achieved in bilateral cooperation in
the fields of politics, economy, science, technology and culture.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that Dehaene's present China tour would
further boost bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Dehaene said that Belgium and China are cooperating in many
areas and there are broad prospects for the two countries'
relations.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that EU-China relations have also witnessed
progress in recent years. The fact that a number of leaders of
European nations and EU visited China recently demonstrated EU's
willingness of reinforcing its ties with China.
</P>
<P>
To increase the cooperation between EU and China would be good
to the stability of the world and the development of economic
globalization, Dehaene said.
</P>
<P>
Li said China is happy to see that the exchange between the
parliaments of the two countries have grown in recent years, which
has helped increase the mutual understanding and friendship
between the two sides. The close contacts between the two
parliaments would help promote the development of Sino-Belgian
relations, he added.
</P>
<P>
He told Dehaene that he is in favor of more active exchanges
and cooperation between the NPC and Belgian parliament.
</P>
<P>
Li also briefed Dehaene on NPC's position and role in China's
political life, as well as the building of the democratic and
legal system in China.
</P>
<P>
Dehaene expressed his appreciation for China's achievements in
building its democratic and legal system.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Delays Implementation of Interim Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The latest interim accord
between Israel and the Palestinians saw the first delay Monday in
its implementation as Israel said the deal would not go into
effect before being ratified by the cabinet and the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that according to
Israel's legal constraints, the accord became effective only after
it was approved by the cabinet and the Knesset, Israel Radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
This means that the implementation of the agreement, which
should begin Monday according to the time line agreed upon, would
be delayed for at least several days.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who postponed a cabinet voting on the agreement
last week, is expected to present the accord to the cabinet for
ratification Tuesday and to the Knesset next week.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) endorsed the agreement
in a cabinet meeting last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said that he would make effort to make sure the delay
in the implementation would be short. Reports said Washington has
accepted Israel's position on the delay.
</P>
<P>
Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, however, stressed
that the implementation should start Monday as scheduled in the
agreement, signed by Netanyahu and PNA Chairman Yasser Arafat on
October 23.
</P>
<P>
The agreement stipulated that it would come into force 10 days
from its signing regardless of ratification.
</P>
<P>
Erekat told Israel Radio that he was sorry that Netanyahu was
preparing grounds for not honoring the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, who was to
meet with Palestinian negotiator Mohammed Abbas (Abu Mazen) Monday
to discuss interim matters, canceled the meeting Sunday night
citing illness.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. senior officials in
charge of the Mideast affairs will visit Lebanon next week in an
effort to revive the stalled peace process, the Daily Star
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
A source with the Foreign Ministry said that the officials are
Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk and Middle East peace
envoy Dennis Ross.
</P>
<P>
The source said the specific date for the tour has yet to be
set and the officials may pay unscheduled visit to Lebanon as they
did before due to security reasons.
</P>
<P>
The officials are also expected to visit Syria, Israel and the
Palestinian self-rule territory, the source said.
</P>
<P>
They will go to Israel and the Palestinian territory to oversee
the implementation of the newly-signed peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Israel will pull back its troops from 13.1
percent more of the West Bank while the Palestinians intensify
their crackdown on Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
In Syria and Lebanon, the U.S. officials will hold talks with
the two countries' leaders to discuss the prospects of resuming
the peace talks with Israel, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between Syria, Lebanon and Israel have been
stalled since Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came to
power in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Israel is occupying Golan Heights that it captured from Syria
in the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
It also carved out a self-declared security zone in southern
Lebanon in 1985 with the aim of protecting its north from
cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Refugees Blamed for Rise of Crimes in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Gu Ming)
</P>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has blamed that
unlawful foreign refugees are causing more and more incidents of
robbery, rape and arson in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Kagera Region in the northwest, which borders Rwanda,
Burundi and Uganda, is one of the areas that bears the brunt of
attacks by illegal refugees.
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months of this year, the region recorded 375
cases of robbery, compared to 337 during the same period last
year. Meanwhile, rape cases increased from 138 to 154 and arson
cases went up sharply from 43 to 151.
</P>
<P>
During January and September, the region also registered 152
murder incidents and 180 cases of cattle rustling.
</P>
<P>
The figures were revealed by Regional Commissioner Mohamed
Babu during a recent tour to the region.
</P>
<P>
For unknown reasons, a lot of refugees who were repatriated at
the end of 1996 had recently come back in thousands especially
from Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
At present, more than 4,400 Rwandans are taking shelter at
refugee camps in the Karagwe District while 110,585 Burundian
refugees are accomodated at the Ngara District.
</P>
<P>
Some of the refugees are collaborating with local bandits in
committing crimes such as armed robbery and ambush of vehicles.
Last Monday, an armed gang in an attack on four vehicles at
Nkenge area on the Kyaka-Bukoba road, robbed passengers of
properties and raped a 30-year-old woman.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Babu has appealed to the government to provide funds
to launch a special crackdown on the rampant bandits.
</P>
<P>
At present, the regional government has no option but to ask
the police to escort vehicles travelling on roads haunted by
bandits and order vehicles not to travel after 7:30 pm on those
roads.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Prime Minister Frederick Sumaye last week described
the problem of refugees as a headache to the government as they
not only caused economic burden but also worsened social security
and environmental situations.
</P>
<P>
At present, the country plays host to more than 300,000
refugees, mostly from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC),
Burundi, Rwanda and Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The refugees are mainly accomodated in Kagera and Kigoma
regions. The Kigoma Regional Commissioner, Ukiwaona Ditopile
Mzuzuri, has also complained about armed banditry incidents
caused by refugees.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Tanzanian Foreign Minister Jakaya Kikwete urged
the international community to help Tanzania solve the problems
of refugees.
</P>
<P>
Recently, ambassadors of the United States, Japan, Denmark,
Britain, Germany and France, as well as U.N. representatives,
toured the Kigoma to see the situation of refugees there.
</P>
<P>
The trip, organized by the United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees and World Food Program, was aimed at winning
financial assistance from major donors to solve problems
related to refugees.

<HEADLINE> Namibian Govt Unearthes Secession Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The Namibian government
Monday claimed to have unearthed a plan, led by former opposition
leader Mishake Muyongo and Mafwe tribe chief Boniface Mamili, to
launch a rebellion to secede Caprivi, South African Press
Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Namibian Army Chif of Staff General Martin Shali said the
government had been monitoring the group.
</P>
<P>
He said there was no room for "terrorists" in Namibia and that
the Namibian Defense Force will deal with the "terrorists" in the
same way it was dealing with rebels in the Democratic Republic of
the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Namibian troops are in the DRC to help President Laurent
Kabila fight rebel forces.
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday, 92 armed Namibians were arrested and detained in
Botswana after illegally entering the country, reportedly seeking
asylum.
</P>
<P>
Another 12 crossed into Botswana last Thursday, saying they
needed protection.
</P>
<P>
They were being held at Kasane on the border between Namibia
and Botswana.
</P>
<P>
The Mafwe are one of five tribes living along the Zambezi and
Kwando riverbanks to the northeast of Namibia.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Turnhalle Alliance, of which Muyongo was
leader, has previously distanced itself from secession attempts.

<HEADLINE> ARATS Sends Letter of Inquiry to Taiwan-Based SEF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) today sent a letter to the
Taiwan-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) inquiring about the
status of Lim Por-Yen, chairman of the Kong-based Lai Sun Group.
</P>
<P>
ARATS noted receipt of letter from Lim saying that he has been
prohibited from leaving Taiwan for 10 months due to an unsettled
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
Lim's letter claims that the failure to settle the case has led
to infringements on his rights.
</P>
<P>
Lim, 86, explained that he suffers from high blood pressure and
simply wants to return to Hong Kong to be with his family and
attend to the business affairs of six listed companies.
</P>
<P>
Lim has applied for the right to return Hong Kong to await
summons from the Taiwan court and pledged to return immediately
upon issuance of the document.
</P>
<P>
The ARATS called on the SEF to coordinate with the relevant
departments and urge them to fully consider Lim's health and
business responsibilities, in addition to instructing the related
departments to make proper arrangements for his timely return to
Hong Kong in view of humanitarianism.

<HEADLINE> S. African Troops Begin Withdrawal From Lesotho </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 2 (Xinhua) -- South Africa began
withdrawing its troops from Lesotho Monday morning, with the
first 500 soldiers having returned to South Africa, South African
radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,400 of the 3,500 troops deployed in Lesotho will pull
out of the mountain kingdom by Wednesday, operation acting
commander Jimmy Masisi was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
South African National Defense Force chief General Siphiwe
Nyanda announced the withdrawal last weekend. He said the
improved situation in Lesotho required the reduction of forces in
Lesotho.
</P>
<P>
Some 600 lightly armed South African soldiers will be sent in
to relieve the 1,400 troops.
</P>
<P>
South African and Botswanan troops entered Lesotho on
September 22 under the auspices of the Southern African
Development Community to help the Lesotho government quell rising
unrest in the country.
</P>
<P>
Trouble in the mountain kingdom started after the Lesotho
opposition protested against the results of the May 23 general
election, claiming that they were rigged in favor of the ruling
Lesotho Congress for Democracy.
</P>
<P>
The unrest boiled up to a major political crisis in
mid-September when junior military officers launched a mutiny and
forced senior officers, including Lesotho Defense Force chief
Makhule Mosakeng, to resign at gun point.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Celebrates Water Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The Water Festival, a week
long celebration centering around three days of interprovincial
boat races, opened here Monday.
</P>
<P>
King Norodom Sihanouk, who had just celebrated his 77th
birthday, and Queen Monineath Sihanouk watched the races with many
senior government officials and distinguished guests, as well as
hundreds of thousands of ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
About 313 boats will take part the competition this year from
November 2 to 4. Among them are 8 women teams. Races began at the
Japanese Bridge and wind their way 1,700 meters to the shores in
front of the royal palace.
</P>
<P>
Victors can get some spoils. First-place winners receive
500,000 riel (105 U.S. dollars), second place receives 400,000
riel (83 dollars), third place gets 300,000 riel (62 dollars) and
fourth place gets 250,000 riel (52 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Boat races and a procession of illuminated floats, very popular
to Cambodians, feature activities of the Water Festival which
falls in the 12th month of the lunar calendar, or late October or
early November.
</P>
<P>
Under the impact of the economic crisis, the Water Festival
budget comes in lower than in past years, at 200,000 U.S. dollars.
The hope to get more racers to wear traditional outfit while
racing was also hurt by the economic crunch and provincial
drought. Boaters who found corporate sponsors would wear shirts
with company logos.
</P>
<P>
Police tightened security check and set up roadblocks at many
important entrances.
</P>
<P>
The much-loved fireworks display will be repeated, using
locally produced as well as Chinese fireworks. In the past, all
the fireworks came from China.
</P>
<P>
The Water Festival is a spectacular event across the country as
it signifies the end of the rainy season of the year, marks the
reversing of the water current in the Tonle Sap river and ushers
in the fishing season.
</P>
<P>
At the height of the rainy season starting from May, the water
in the Mekong River flows with such power that it backs up into
Tonle Sap, forcing the Tonle Sap to reverse its current and begin
flowing northward to the Great Lake which swells to three times
its dry season size.
</P>
<P>
As rainfall decreases and the water level in the Mekong River
drops, Tonle Sap begins to subside and its water current reverses
tying itself into the Mekong River.

<HEADLINE> HK Government Committed to Curbing Air Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government has
stressed the need to combat air pollution and is committed to
improving the region's air quality.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Planning, Environment and Lands Bureau
noted on Sunday that Hong Kong's overall air quality is about the
same as many other major metropolis such as London and New York.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said: "our main problem is the very high density
of motor vehicles and the high diesel vehicle mileage that have
caused air pollution and nuisances at the roadside."
</P>
<P>
The government's proposal is to require a mandatory use of
liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) taxis as from the end of 2000 and
encourage all diesel taxis to be phased out within a 5-year
period.
</P>
<P>
Replacing diesel taxis by LPG taxis can reduce 30 percent of
the respirable suspended particulates emitted from motor vehicles.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the spokesman said the government is exploring a
package of new measures to deal with vehicle air pollution in a
comprehensive manner.
</P>
<P>
"We are also stepping up vehicle inspection and looking into
the feasibility of extending the use of LPG or other clean
alternative fuel vehicles to replace diesel vehicles," he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the government has begun to address the
issue of air pollution together with adjacent cities in the long
term.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has agreed with the Guangdong authorities to put up a
 joint study to look into the air pollution problem in a regional
perspective as well as to consider joint action and plans to stop
the air quality from deterioration, he added.

<HEADLINE> Mainland-HK Trade Enjoys Comprehensive Growth: Chinese Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The economic and trading
relations between China's interior and Hong Kong have enjoyed a
comprehensive development during the 20 years since China pursued
the policy of opening to the outside world, a Chinese official
said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Wang Hui, director-general of the Department of Taiwan, Hong
Kong and Macao of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation (MOFTEC) of China, said that the trade volume between
the interior and Hong Kong increased from 2.607 billion
U.S. dollars in 1978 to 50.771 billion U.S. dollars in 1997, which
 represented an 18-fold expansion.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the China Business Update Conference held Monday at
Hong Kong's Grand Hyatt Hotel, Wang said that in the first nine
months this year, the volume of export and import between the
mainland and Hong Kong amounted to 34.94 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The volume of the export from the mainland to Hong Kong was
30.12 billion U.S. dollars while the import from Hong Kong to the
mainland was 4.82 billion U.S. dollars, Wang said. Hong Kong is
now the third largest trading partner of the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hong Kong has become the most important source of
overseas investment for China, Wang added.
</P>
<P>
There had been 170,000 Hong Kong invested projects in the
mainland by the end of 1997 while in the past nine months this
year, 5,948 more Hong Kong funded companies had been approved by
authorities of the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Also at the conference, Shao Ning, director general of the
Department of Enterprises of the State Economic and Trade
Commission, said that the reform of China's state-owned
enterprises will provide more and more opportunities for overseas
investors to participate in China's economic development.
</P>
<P>
At present, Shao said, China's state-owned enterprises have set
up over 10,000 joint ventures with overseas investors and the
purchase of state-owned enterprises by overseas companies will
face no policy barriers at all.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of government officials, businessmen and scholars from
 China's mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan as well as foreign
countries attended the one-day conference.

<HEADLINE> Northern Vietnam Reaping Autumn Rice Crop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in Vietnam's northern
provinces harvested a total of 707,000 hectares of autumn rice, 60
percent of the cultivated area, by the end of October, Vietnam
News Agency (VNA) reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in the Red River Delta have brought in 59 percent of
their planted area, VNA quoted the Ministry of Agriculture and
rural Development (MARD) as saying.
</P>
<P>
Officials predicted that Thai Binh province, located more than
100 km southeast of Hanoi, would produce between 5.3 and 5.4 tons
of rice per hectare.
</P>
<P>
This year foodstuff output for Thai Binh province, including
spring rice, autumn rice and other foodstuff crops, is a record
1.025 to 1.05 million tons.
</P>
<P>
This is the fourth year the province has harvested over 1
million tons of crops.
</P>
<P>
Along with harvesting their autumn rice, farmers in northern
provinces have also planted about 347,000 hectares of winter
crops.
</P>
<P>
As rainfall nationwide has only been 50 percent of the usual
yearly level, the MARD foresees a shortage of water throughout the
country, particlarly in northern and central regions.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has asked all localities to use water thriftily
and protect water resouces such as rivers, lakes, ponds and
reservoirs.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Exports 3.25 Million Tons of Rice by October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Rice volume loaded on board in
October was expected to be 200,000 tons, bringing Vietnam's total
export in the first ten months to 3.25 million tons, the Saigon
Times daily reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The English-language daily in Ho Chi Minh City quoted a
government official as saying that the rice export now is mostly
to fill a major deal with Indonesia and old contracts.
</P>
<P>
"New contracts have not been signed as Vietnam's export prices
are still high compared to falling prices in the world market,"
the official said.
</P>
<P>
Currently 25 percent broken grade is quoted 272-274 U.S.
dollars per ton F.O.B. Saigon Port, while in Bangkok quotations
of the same grade are at around 265-267 U.S. dollars a ton.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, five percent broken grade is offered at 287-290
dollars a ton, down from 295 dollars last week, the Saigon Times
daily said.
</P>
<P>
Local traders are now keen on the export of high-grade rice, as
they find trading of 25 percent broken grade too expensive due to
mounting domestic prices.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam plans to export 3.7-3.8 million tons of rice in 1999.
Up to 80 percent of the year's quotas will be allocated early with
20 percent by the end of the third quarter.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Congress Could Pass 1999 Budget Before </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The Estrada administration
expressed its confidence Monday that the congress can pass the
proposed 579.5 billion peso (14 billion U.S. dollars) national
budget for 1999 before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
In a report published here Monday, Secretary Benjamin Diokno of
the Department of Budget and Management said that the close
coordination between the executive department and the congress
would likely lead to the swift passage of the national budget for
1999.
</P>
<P>
He said the swift passage is likely as the Senate started
hearings even before it formally received the proposed budget from
the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
"When we resume (congressional deliberations on the budget) on
November 9, the moment the budget is submitted to us, then we will
already have a head start and we expect to use up less time in
order to act on the budget," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The House (of Representatives) passed the budget proposed by
President (Joseph) Estrada virtually intact, so we can see here
the close coordination between the executive and the congress,"
Diokno said.
</P>
<P>
The House of Representatives approved on second reading on
October 24 the proposed 1999 budget without making major changes
to the Estrada administration's proposal.
</P>
<P>
The House will approve the proposed budget on third and final
reading when it resumes session next week.
</P>
<P>
The budget proposal will then go to the Senate for further
deliberations and approval.
</P>
<P>
"So we are hopeful that it will be approved before the
Christmas break on December 23," Diokno said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The Estrada administration will
undertake a major overhaul of the farming sector to make the
Philippines' small farmers more globally competitive, a senior
official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting here, Secretary Horacio Morales Jr. of
the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) said that he and President
Joseph Estrada discussed over the weekend the importance of
orienting the farmers on the need to meet the demands of global
competition.
</P>
<P>
He said that Estrada stressed the need to make farmers
understand the magnitude of the economic crisis the country is
facing and the great demands of global competition.
</P>
<P>
"It would be better to put emphasis on the reorientation of
farmers, to make them aware that they cannot compete globally
unless they achieve higher productivity," Morales said.
</P>
<P>
"We will reorient the present farming methods that we're doing
and the way we develop the countryside," he added.
</P>
<P>
President Estrada has repeatedly vowed to give utmost priority
to agricultural modernization in line with his administration's
centerpiece program to attain national food security and combat
rural poverty.

at present 3,458 elementary schools and almost half of the
secondary schools in the country have no principals or even head
teachers to supervise academic functions.
</P>
<P>
According to Gonzalez, only 24 percent or 8,637 of the
country's 35,516 elementary schools are headed by full-fledged
principals.
</P>
<P>
The shortage of principals is worse in secondary schools as
only 53.44 percent or 2,089 of 3,909 schools have principals, he
said.
</P>
<P>
To resolve this shortfall, he said, his department has proposed
the adoption of the following schemes:
</P>
<P>
-- the appointment of a school-based head for big central
schools;
</P>
<P>
-- the designation of a non-school-based head, such as cluster
heads and district supervisors, for small schools in remote areas;
and
</P>
<P>
-- the integration of an elementary and a secondary school
under the concept of integrated schools.
</P>
<P>
He said that his department has appealed to the congress to
uphold the Estrada administration's proposal giving the education
sector the lion's share of the 1999 budget.

<P>
COLOMBO, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka will launch a trial
project to generate electricity from wood to overcome an
anticipated electricity shortage, according to the Forest
Department Monday.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Iranian Army Starts Final Stage of Grand Maneuver </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian army started the
final stage of the Zulfaqar-2 military war games Monday morning
along the country's eastern border with Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The official news agency IRNA reported that the war games
were launched in the Zabol operation zone, the southeastern
province of Sistan-Baluchestan which borders Afghanistan and
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Some 200,000-strong forces, hundreds of tanks and armored
personnel carriers as well as tens of fighters and helicopters
took part in this stage of the military exercises, IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
Air attack of air-force fighters and helicopters and that of
armored and infantry forces on the positions of the mock enemy
are parts of the final stage of the maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
The Zulfaqar-2 maneuver, the biggest one launched by the
Iranian army since the Islamic Revolution in 1979, was kicked
off Saturday night after a month-long delay.
</P>
<P>
The maneuver was scheduled to be launched by end of September
in an area of 5,000 square kilometers amid tension between Iran
and the Afghan Taliban militia who killed nine Iranian diplomats
and reporter in northern Afghanistan in August.
</P>
<P>
It was postponed after the U.N. Secretary General's special
envoy on Afghan affairs Lakhdar Brahimi succeeded in persuading
the Taliban to repatriate the remains of the killed Iranians and
release 51 Iranian hostages.

<HEADLINE> Currency Trading, Root Cause of Financial Crisis: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad Monday described currency trading as the root
cause of the present financial crisis, saying unless this is
recognized corrective action cannot be taken to solve the
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"If currency trading cannot be done away with, then it should
be properly supervised and regulated," he said in a keynote
address at a luncheon held in conjunction with a two-day
international conference on "Managing the Asian Financial Crisis:
Lessons and Challenges" which opened here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said currency trading in the present form was not
essential even though exchanging one currency for another was
necessary for world trade.
</P>
<P>
"There is no reason why the world cannot act in concert to
regulate currency trading," said Mahathir, who is also the first
finance minister.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said, "This is possible if the big rich economic
powers are willing to cooperate, to enact laws and rules and to
enforce them."
</P>
<P>
He said the rules and regulations and laws would obviously
prevent the traders from making the kind of profit they were used
to making.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that currency trading must be forced into the
open and the world must act in concert to prevent money
laundering.

<HEADLINE> Iran Slams Arafat for Signing Accord with Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 2 (Xinhua) -- A senior Iranian official has
lashed out at Palestinian Leader Yasser Arafat for signing the
latest peace deal with Israel, local daily Tehran Times reported
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement is 100 percent in favor of Israel," deputy
foreign minister for Arab and African affairs, Mohammad Sadr, said
 in an interview with the conservative-prone newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Sadr said Arafat has become a policeman charged with ensuring
the security of Israel as a result of the agreement, signed in
Washington on October 23 after nine days of marathon negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, Israel will withdraw from 13.1 percent of the
West Bank in three months while Palestinians convene the
Palestinian National Council to revoke anti-Israeli clauses in its
National Charter and crack down anti-Israeli terrorist activities.
</P>
<P>
The accord broke a 19-month deadlock of the Palestinian-Israeli
peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Now, after signing this agreement both Arafat and Israel have
united for the Israeli security and for cracking down on the
genuine struggle against oppression," Sadr was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the agreement also creates a gulf among Palestinian
forces and allows Arafat to silence any voice against Israel. "It
has become the duty of Arafat to destroy all the movements for the
liberation of Palestine," Sadr said.
</P>
<P>
The security would not be for the region, but only for
Israel, he added.

KATHMANDU, November 2 (Xinhua) -- A four-member parliamentary
team of Nepal left here Monday for Bhutan for an official visit
which aims to create a conducive atmosphere for solving the
problems between the two Himalayan kingdoms including the refugee
issue.
</P>
<P>
Hiranya Lal Shrestha, chairman of the Lower House Foreign

PARIS, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers on Monday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The acts of violence by youngsters living in suburbs are now
moving toward the center of big French cities, as was shown by the
violence in the demonstration of high school students last month
in Paris. Paris has been the primary target of violent acts by the
youngters, as is shown through the increasing damage teenage riders
done to public transportation facilities.
</P>
<P>
-- Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov is now walking on a
central line between that of the International Monetary Fund and
the policy of the past state control. In a speech made last
Saturday, Primakov vowed to restore economic order through state
intervention mainly with the relaunching of its social policy and
supporting of national industry.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- One week after the signing of the Wye River agreement aimed
at relaunching the Middle East peace process, an Israeli
mechanical shovel began to collect rubbles Sunday morning in
preparation for the construction of a new Jewish settlement of 132
apartments in the Arab district of Ras al-Amud in East
Jerusalem. This action is putting fire on the powder among the
11,000 Palestinian residents in the district facing the Esplanade
of Mosques.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. president Bill Clinton is expecting limited damage to
come down from the mid-term election of the two houses of the
Congress. While certain to maintain majority in the two houses,
the Republicans are no longer certain about a large victory over
the Democrats. Thirty-three seats out of 100 of the Senate, all
the 435 seats in the House of Representatives and 36 out of 50
seats of governors are open to the competition from the candidates
of the two parties.

ANKARA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Turkish newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sabah (Morning)
</P>
<P>
-- Speaking at a mass rally in Ankara Sunday, Murat Bozlak,
chairman of Turkey's People's Democracy Party, called on the
government to try to solve the Kurdish problem through dialog and
talks and change its policy on the Kurdish problem.
</P>
<P>
Turkish troops have been carrying out military operations in
the southeastern region since 1984 in an effort to wipe out the
militants of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National)
</P>
<P>
-- In order not to anger Turkey, the Russian government has

<HEADLINE> Hamas Officials Deny Threatening Arafat's Reign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Senior officials of the
Islamic militant group Hamas have denied that its military wing
has threatened to turn its guns towards the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA), local radio and TV reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted a senior Hamas official in Gaza as denying
Sunday night that a leaflet faxed to some news organizations
carrying the warning earlier in the day came from the military or
political wing of Hamas.
</P>
<P>
A Hamas spokesman in Hebron, Abdel Khalek Natshe, also denied
the leaflet was authentic and accused Israel of fabricating it to
press the PNA to crack down further on the militants.
</P>
<P>
The leaflet, signed by Hamas' military wing, Izzedine al Qassem
Brigades, threatened violent retaliation against the PNA if it
continued to press its campaign against Hamas.
</P>
<P>
If the leaflet was true, it would be the first time that Hamas
has made a direct threat against the PNA. The militant
organization has said that it wanted to avoid confrontation among
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The extraordinary warning followed a roundup by Palestinian
security forces of Hamas' leadership and activists, launched last
week after PNA Chairman Yasser Arafat signed a land-for-peace deal
on October 23 in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The agreement calls for tougher Palestinian measures to fight
terrorism in exchange for further Israeli withdrawal from the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The crackdown was intensified after a failed suicide bombing in
Gaza on Thursday. More than 100 Hamas activists have been rounded
up and Hamas founder and spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin has
been put under house arrest by Palestinian security forces.
</P>
<P>
The leaflet accused Arafat of having "reached the point of
treason" by moving against Hamas, calling for an immediate end to
the ongoing crackdown in order to spare Palestinians "the
horrors ... of civil war."
</P>
<P>
Palestinian security officials took the warnings seriously and
issued some of their own in response.
</P>
<P>
"We have only one authority in this land, which is the
Palestinian National Authority," Palestinian police chief Ghazi
Jabali said. "We are going to take all measures to control the
situation."
</P>
<P>
Tawfik Tarawi, head of the Palestinian general intelligence
service in the West Bank, also said that "I hope that it (the
leaflet) isn't true, but if this is Hamas' method we will react
strongly against any attempt to assault any security or police
officer."

<P>
TOKYO, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices in Tokyo posted a

<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange advanced 388.24 points to end

First Section issues, gained 30.24 points or 2.92 percent to
1,065.84.

million shares being traded, almost unchanged from Friday.

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

signs that more large Japanese banks are seeking to trim their
overseas operations in order to beef up their capital.

importer of Japanese cars and electronics goods, posted an
annualized 3.3 percent rise in gross domestic product for the
July-September quarter, surpassing analysts' forecasts.
</P>
<P>

decision among the Group of Seven industrialized nations to create
a 90 billion U.S. dollar safety net to contain the crisis in
the emerging economies.

<P>
Of the issues listed on the First Section, gainers outnumbered
losers 837 to 237, with 193 issues remaining unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Commemorating Forerunner of China's Science, Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 2 (Xinhua) -- A group of Chinese scientists
gathered here today at prestigious Qinghua University to
commemorate the 180th anniversary of birth of Xu Shou, forerunner
of China's modern science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Xu, a native of Wuxi in east China's Jiangsu Province, was born
in 1818 and died in 1884, a period during which China was
suffering from invasion by imperialist powers.
</P>
<P>
Xu was a chemist, a munitions expert, a translator and an
educator. He devoted himself wholeheartedly to the natural
sciences for the purpose of making China more prosperous and
powerful.
</P>
<P>
Xu had a good command of languages, mathematics, physics,
chemistry and machinery, and stressed the importance of learning
from the advanced technologies of the Western countries.
</P>
<P>
Under Xu's guidance, China's first steamship, the "Huanghu,"
was launched at Nanjing in 1865.
</P>
<P>
He also guided the production of China's first group of warships
and first steam engine.
</P>
<P>
Participants at today's gathering also praised Xu's contributions
to introducing Western scientific and technological methods.
</P>
<P>
Most of Xu's descendants were also engaged in scientific
research. Xu's second son, Xu Jianyin, was a famous military
industry expert of modern China, who died experimenting with
smokeless gunpowder in 1901.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: One China Principle Is Undoubted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The diplomatic ties established
today between China and Tonga marks new progress for relations
between China and the countries of the South Pacific region, and
indicates the willingness of an increasing number of countries to
normalize ties with China under the One China principle.
</P>
<P>
Tonga recognizes that there is only one China, and the People's
Republic of China is the sole legitimate government representing
the whole of China, and Taiwan is an inalienable part of China,
according to a joint communique signed by the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Along with Tonga, there are now 11 countries of the 16-member
South Pacific Forum which have forged diplomatic links with China.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Cook Islands in the South Pacific, the Bahamas and
St. Lucia in the Caribbean, as well as South Africa, the Central
African Republic and Guinea-Bissau in Africa have all formed or
restored diplomatic relations with China since last year.
</P>
<P>
To date, there are 163 countries which have diplomatic
relations with the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
The normalization of relations between China and Taiwan's so-
called allies in these three regions shows that the One China
principle is undoubted, and that bilateral relations of
mutual benefit with China under the One China principle has become
a trend.
</P>
<P>
"St. Lucia has proceeded in a direction which the majority of
the countries of the world has already trod by establishing
diplomatic links with the People's Republic of China," said
St. Lucia's Prime Minister Kenny Anthony.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice Premier Qian Qichen, in meeting with Koo Chen-fu,
chairman of Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation, two weeks ago,
said the fact that Taiwan's so-called international space is
narrowing is an inevitable result of the current situation,
and that the trend is ongoing.

<HEADLINE> No Blanket Amnesty in South Africa: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 2 (Xinhua) -- A senior South African
official has reiterated that there will be no general amnesty for
those who have been found responsible for gross human rights
violation during apartheid era, local daily Sowetan reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The South African government has "never considered blanket
amnesty because we believe it is not in the interest of the
people of South Africa", Justice Minister Dullah Omar was quoted
as saying Sunday.
</P>
<P>
However, Omar indicated that some important government
officials like Winnie Madikizela-Mandela and Mangosuthu
Buthelezi, who have been fingered in the TRC report for human
rights violations, might escape prosecution.
</P>
<P>
Madikizila-Mandela, normally called Winnie, is ex-wife of
South African President Nelson Mandela. Buthelezi, chairman of
the biggest black opposition party Inkatha Freedom Party,
currently is minister of home affairs in the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to be reckless because some of the people
mentioned, like Mrs Madikizela-Mandela and Dr. Buthelezi, are
important people who have played a significant role in this
country," Omar said.
</P>
<P>
He said the matter will be referred to the cabinet which will
develop guidelines on the matter.
</P>
<P>
Winnie and Buthelezi are but two in a long list of high
profile politicians who may be liable for prosecution. These
include the two apartheid era's presidents, P W Botha and F W De
Klerk.
</P>
<P>
Both Botha and De Klerk have not applied for amnesty.
</P>
<P>
In its 3,500-page final report issued last Friday, the Truth
and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) also said that the ruling African
National Congress should be responsible for gross human rights
violations in its struggle against apartheid both indisde and
outside the country.
</P>
<P>
President Mandela has accepted the report, but his deputy
Thabo Mbeki, who is also chairman of the ANC, described the
report as "wrong and misguided", and demanded for correction.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Buthelezi lauded the ANC for its legal action
against the TRC, saying the party was within its right to
challenge the contents of the report.

<HEADLINE> Retired President Benefits Bill Not Law Yet: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The bill passed by the Ugandan
Parliament on the reduction of benefits of retired presidents is
not a law yet, the Public Relations Officer of the Parliament
Kagole Kivumbi told Xinhua in a telephone interview Monday
morning.
</P>
<P>
Kivumbi said: "According to the Consitution, a bill becomes a
law if the president gives consent to it. Usually, the president
will sign it within 30 days after it is passed by the
legislature."
</P>
<P>
When asked for the reasons for the slashed benefits for the
retired presidents, he said it should be based on the economic
situation of the country.
</P>
<P>
It should not be taken to mean that the economy does not
perform as well as in the past. It is a result of rationization,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The East African weekly reported that the Ugandan Parliament
passed a law reducing the retirement benefits of ex-presidents
and restricting movement and free education of the incumbent
president's offspring.
</P>
<P>
The decision was a result of debate on the Presidential
Emoluments and Benefits Bill tabled by Public Service Minister
Nuwa Amanya Mushega.
</P>
<P>
According to the bill, presidents who cease to hold office
other than for abuse of office or misconduct should get 2 million
Shillings (1,481 U.S. Dollars) per month on top of a fully
furnished house, government-paid chauffeur-driven car and free
medical treatment for self and immediate family.
</P>
<P>
Under the passed bill, retired presidents are now to get a
furniture allowance of 20 million shillings (14,815 Dollars)
every five years.
</P>
<P>
The legislature also endorsed 300,000 Shillings (222 Dollars)
per month as medical allowances for family and another 500,000
Shillings (371 Dollars) per month for utility costs.
</P>
<P>
If a retired president dies, the immediate family is entitled
to allowances equivalent to half of what the deceased president
is earning for six months onwards only.
</P>
<P>
However, the report said, the parliament did not change the
provision of the bill which entitles the head of state to a
monthly salary of 3.6 million Shillings (2,667 Dollars).

<HEADLINE> Zambia Pursues Tight Monetary Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's central bank, the Bank
of Zambia (BOZ), has pursued a tight monetary policy to withdraw
excess funds from the public to curb the speculative demand and
unnecessary demand pressures on the foreign exchange supply.
</P>
<P>
This was confirmed by BOZ spokesman Kabinga Pande at the
weekend, state-controlled Times of Zambia reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
This policy, explained Panda, aimed to resolve the
contradiction between demand and supply on the country's forex
market and check the continuous depreciation of the local
currency Kwacha.
</P>
<P>
The local Kwacha has depreciated by more than 60 percent in
the past year from one U.S. Dollar against 1,300 at the end of
1997 to 2,100 Kwacha at present.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman attributed this to a number of factors like the
suspension of the balance of payments support by donors and the
low sales of the Zambian Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM), the
country's main foreign currency earner, as well as the seasonal
factor of increased demand of foreign exchange by the public as
the year end approaches.
</P>
<P>
Pande said that Zambia's export earnings have dropped due to
global El Nino effects which have adversely affected the
country's non-traditional exports.
</P>
<P>
External shocks such as the financial crisis in Asia is one of
the factors that have contributed to the falling of the local
currency on both the local and international markets, he added.
</P>
<P>
The combination of the low demand of copper and the reduced
prices on the world market have contributed to low foreign
exchange earnings, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the demand remains high on the local foreign exchange
market and the falling of the local currency has also seen the
rising of inflation, said the BOZ official.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Mayor Trial Opens in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The trial of the Kampala City
Mayor Nasser Sebaggala opens Monday in the new federal district
court of Massachusetts, the United States.
</P>
<P>
According to a New Vision report Monday, the trial
proceedings will be presided over by an African-American judge,
Regnald Lindsay and is expected to take up to three weeks.
</P>
<P>
The embattled mayor, who has been held in the U.S. since June
13, is represented by a team of lawyers led by Paul Kelly and
Eliot LLP.
</P>
<P>
The mayor is charged with eight counts, with four of which
related to alleged fraudulent checks, two to transportation of
false securities and two of false declarations to U.S. Customs.
</P>
<P>
The Prosecution alleged that the accused has a grand scheme to
defraud Bank Boston, a federally insured financial institution,
by means of false and fraudulent pretenses, representations and
promises.
</P>
<P>
The wife of the mayor, who is also the deputy speaker of the
city council, has flown to the U.S. to hear the trial.
</P>
<P>
She had reportedly threatened a Bank of Uganda official, who
is to testify against the mayor, with death, a charge she denied
immediately over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan authorities said earlier that Sebaggala had committed
some economic crimes also in Uganda, making his future as mayor
more uncertain.
</P>
<P>
Though democratically elected mayor of the capital in April,
he has been accused by opponents of lacking an A level
certificate required by the post.

financial bonds to cater to the needs of a variety of investors.
</P>
<P>

and management systems in recent years, enabling the bank to
maintain a high bond-repayment record.

JERUSALEM, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Some 60,000 Palestinian
workers and 21,000 businessmen were allowed to enter Israel as of
Monday morning as the closure imposed on Gaza and the West Bank
was completely lifted.

The closure was imposed by Israeli army on September 11
following the Islamic Resistance Group (Hamas) vowed to avenge the
killing by Israeli soldiers of its two senior members. It has been
gradually eased since the end of the Jewish holiday of Sukkot, or
Feast of Booths, about three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
On Monday morning the number of Palestinians allowed to enter
Israel was restored to the level before the seal.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials have said that the blanket closure has
caused millions of U.S. dollars of losses every day to Palestinian
economy.

<HEADLINE> Archeologists Discover Ancient Great Wall in Mu Us Desert by Zhou Jianwei and Wu Xiaojun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists have
discovered a section of the Great Wall dating back
over 1,400 years on the edge of the Mus Us Desert, China's
third largest desert, some 700 kilometers west of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Wang Huimin, an authority on the Great Wall from the Ningxia
Institute of Archeology, told Xinhua today after completing a
two-month field investigation with his colleagues that this
25-kilometer-long section of the Wall, built in the Sui Dynasty
(581-618 A.D.), is located in Yanchi County in northwest China's
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
He said traces of the Sui Great Wall were firstly spotted in
a photo taken from a U.S. space shuttle during a Sino-U.S. joint
research program on the ancient Great Wall and Silk Road in the
deserts of western China.
</P>
<P>
As this section was buried under the desert for a long time, it
was not discovered until desert control efforts dispersed the
sands, inch by inch, and it rose higher and higher above the
ground over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the Sui Great Wall is totally different from other
parts of the Great Wall in color and architectural structure.
</P>
<P>
He said most of other parts of the Great Wall were either
light yellow in color or blue-grey.
</P>
<P>
This newly discovered section is made of red sandy soil and
purple siltstone, is about 1 to 2.8 meters high and 5 to 13 meters
wide, with a ditch 0.6 to 1.5 meters high on the outer side.
</P>
<P>
The Sui Great Wall lies parallel to a 178-kilometer-long
section of the Wall built in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644 A.D.).
</P>
<P>
Wang said most parts of the Great Wall built in other
dynasties were made of packed-down soil or bricks.
</P>
<P>
He said the Sui Great Wall, buried under the desert from
hundreds of years, was discovered thanks to the planting of
shelter forests at the edge of the desert by local farmers over
the past dozen years.
</P>
<P>
The number of rural households around the Sui Great Wall has
grown from only one a dozen years ago to 200, since the curbing of
desertification and the creation of more cultivated farmland.
</P>
<P>
According to historical records, the total length of the Great
Wall, built over many dynasties, is some 6,000 kilometers, and the
Sui Great Wall stretches over 350 kilometers from Suide in Shaanxi
Province to Lingwu in Ningxia.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that most of what is called the Sui Great Wall was
rebuilt during the Ming Dynasty, and the newly discovered section
is the only part found thus far that was actually built during the
Sui Dynasty.

<P>
JERUSALEM, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The Palestinian-Israeli agreement signed in Washington does
not go into effect Monday as scheduled because it has not yet been
ratified by Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said
Sunday that the accord will be presented to the cabinet for
ratification on Tuesday, with the understanding that the
Palestinians will have presented their security working paper by
then.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. believed that it obtained a verbal understanding
from Netanyahu at the Washington summit that Israel would not
build at Har Homa soon, nor would it engage in "substantial"
expansion of existing settlements, senior U.S. diplomatic
officials said.
</P>
<P>
But Netanyahu's spokesman denied that the prime minister had
made such verbal commitments, saying natural growth of the
settlements can continue.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon will suggest in his
talks with Palestinian negotiators that the final-status agreement
between Israel and the Palestinians be implemented in a period of
20 years.
</P>
<P>
He will present his idea to U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright next week.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Extends Insured Loans for Car Buyers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, November 2 (Xinhua) -- A local bank and an insurance
company in Guangdong Province have jointly introduced insured
loans for car buyers in a bid to prod the automobile
market.
</P>
<P>
Under this new procedure, potential car buyers are obliged to
buy a loan repayment commitment insurance policy from the
Guangzhou Branch of the China Pacific Insurance Company as a
mortgage applied to car-buying loans from the Guangdong Branch of
the Agriculture Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
The insured car loan will be about 10 percent lower than
a purchase by installment offered by a local car dealer, local
source said.
</P>
<P>
A survey shows that as many as 26.8 percent of the residents of
Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong Province, want to purchase cars by
the installment plan, making the car-buying market second only to
the housing market in the province.

<HEADLINE> More Chinese Tourists in Scandinavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 2 (Xinhua) -- "Chinese tourists have
accounted for almost half of the Asian visitors in Scandinavia,
and we are most interested in the Chinese market," said Pirkko
Hannula, spokeswoman for a Scandinavian tourism promotion bureau.
</P>
<P>
Hannula is here attending the '98 China International Travel
Mart. According to officials at the department of tourism,
Scandinavian countries such as Denmark, Finland and Sweden have
shown a great interest in China's tourism market as Chinese
visitors to Scandinavia reached 100,000 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Tourism committees in these countries plan to set up offices in
Beijing and Shanghai next year to promote international travel, as
they have done in Singapore, Seoul, Bangkok and the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
The Scandinavian countries are famous for their fairy tales,
Santa Claus and pop music, and are also renowned for their
beautiful scenery, advanced pollution-treatment technologies and
effective social welfare systems. So these days, more and more
Asian tourist are travelling to this part of the world.

<HEADLINE> SADC Allied Forces to Launch Offensive in Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The allied forces of the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) have resolved to
embark on an offensive campaign in the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC) aimed at clearing rebels backed by Rwanda and Uganda
from the eastern parts of the DRC.
</P>
<P>
This was announced Sunday by Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe in Lubumbashi of southern DRC at the end of an urgent
meeting called to review the may forward in view of the collapse
of peace talks in Lusaka last week, the Daily Herald reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting in Lubumbashi was attended by presidents Sam
Nujoma of Namibia and Laurent Kabila of the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of the allied forces, Mugabe said they had
decided to go on an enemy clearance mission in search of lasting
peace.
</P>
<P>
Angolan President Eduardo dos Santos did not attend the
meeting, but was said to be in agreement with the allied forces'
resolution to flush rebels out of the DRC, the third largest
country on the African continent.
</P>
<P>
"What we are going into is the third phase of the struggle
aimed at protecting the sovereignty of the Congo. We are going
on the clearance of the enemy (rebels and their backers) from the
territory," Mugabe said.
</P>
<P>
He would not give operational details on how the onslaught
would be launched but confirmed that forces from the three
countries -- Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe -- had already been
deployed in the east, following a resolution taken in Harare
prior to the failed Lusaka summit and aimed at halting conquest
moves in the eastern parts of the vast Great Lakes country.
</P>
<P>
The allied forces have already taken their position and are
expected to launch a heavy offensive against rebel-held positions
any time this week. The attacks will be aimed at retaking the
captured towns and flushing rebels and their backers out of the
DRC.
</P>
<P>
"During the second phase of the struggle, we decided to go
east. As we were discussing in Harare, preparations were going
on. That decision has since been implemented. We now have
troops in towns like Bujimayi, among others," said Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
"We were disappointed by the stance taken by Rwanda during the
recent Lusaka meeting, denying that it had any of its troops in
the Congo. That did not make it possible to discuss any peace
accord," he added.

<HEADLINE> Guilin: China's Model for Sustainable Development of Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
GUILIN, November 2 (Xinhua) -- In a recent environmental
assessment of 46 key Chinese cities conducted by the National
Administration of Environmental Protection, the city of Guilin led
the list in environmental quality.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that this famous tourist Mecca has found the right
road to sustainable growth for its tourist industry by protecting
its environment.
</P>
<P>
Located along the Lijiang River of South China's Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region, this city of 500,000 people is known
worldwide for its natural scenery and cultural heritage. In 1997
alone, the city played host to more than 7 million overseas and
domestic travelers.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1970s, however, the poetic Lijiang River was
contaminated by industrial pollution. When Deng Xiaoping, who was
in charge of the country's industrial production at that time,
visited Guilin, he saw that an overwhelming amount of foul smoke
and wastewater was about to turn the people's fond memory of the
city into a thing of the past, permanently.
</P>
<P>
"We will lose more than we get if we pollute the Lijiang
River, no matter how fast we develop industries," he said. And
under his directions, the State Council made a decision for
"Restoring and Protecting the Environment of Guilin."
</P>
<P>
Environmental protection is now a 10-year-old national policy
in China. Guilin, in order to maintain its natural beauty and
promote the balanced growth of tourism without endangering the
environment, has beefed up pollution-control efforts and
investment in environment-friendly industries.
</P>
<P>
It has closed 49 factories and mills in recent years and built
142 foul-water processing systems to ensure a clean Lijiang River,
and more than 200,000 yuan (24,000 US dollars) of special funds
has been allocated annually for planting trees along the river
banks.
</P>
<P>
Despite financial turmoil in southeast Asia, Guilin continues
to attract tourists at a record rate. According to official
sources, the city's income from international travelers reached
1.18 million yuan in 1997, 11.9 percent more than 1996. Tourism
revenue now accounts for 15.14 percent of the city's GDP value.

<HEADLINE> Desert Control Unveils Ancient Great Wall in Northwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Bai Chunlan, a farmer living
on the edge the Mu Us, China's third largest desert, was greatly
surprised when an archaeologist told him that the dirt wall in
front of his courtyard is a section of the Great Wall built over
1,400 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists say that a two-month field investigation proves
that this 25-kilometer section of the Great Wall is the remains of
a 350-kilometer Great Wall built in the Sui Dynasty (581-618
A.D.), the only section of the Great Wall dating to the Sui
Dynasty discovered.
</P>
<P>
This new discovery coincides with historical records on the
Great Wall.
</P>
<P>
Differing from other sections of the Great Wall, this part is
of a dark-red color and built of piled-up soil.
</P>
<P>
The newly discovered section is about 1 to 2.8
meters high and 5 to 13 meters wide. It also has a protective
ditch beside the outer portion of the Wall.
</P>
<P>
Bai, a Shabian Village farmer in Yanchi County in the Ningxia
Hui Autonomous Region, said he never dreamed that the tree
planting and crop growing done by his family, the only household
in the area for over a dozen years ago would result not only in
harvests, but in helping to unveil a part of the Great Wall buried
in the sand for many centuries.
</P>
<P>
Helped by scientists, Bai's family planted 16,000 trees and
grass over vast desert areas during the past decade. Together with
the efforts of other farmers, the one-tree village has turned into
an oasis.
</P>
<P>
The local government also funded the building of irrigation
channels along the edge of desert.
</P>
<P>
Bai's family also used ground water from a well to irrigate
wheat and maize.
</P>
<P>
The Great Wall surfaced from the ground gradually with the
enlargement of the shelter forest and the growing of crops.
</P>
<P>
The Great Wall has a total length of around 6,000
kilometers. Archeologists believe that most of the remains of the
ancient Great Wall in northwest China has been sleeping under the
desert.
</P>
<P>
China has serious desertification problems and the desert land
in the country expands by 2,460 square kilometers each year.
</P>
<P>
To curb the expansion of deserts, China has built a
4,480-kilometer-long shelter forest or so-called "Green Great
Wall" in the past 20 years in provinces and autonomous region in
northern China.
</P>
<P>
Lei Renze, Director of the Ningxia Regional Bureau of Cultural
Relics, said that although the newly discovered section of the
Great Wall is only a small part of the Wall, it is a good
beginning for more discoveries and the bureau has drawn up a
detailed plan for protecting the Great Wall.

HAIKOU, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Exports from this island
province in south China rose 7.4 percent to reach 666 million
U.S. dollars in the first three quarters of this year.
</P>
<P>
A local trade official cited four major reasons for the
increased exports:
</P>
<P>
Reform of the existing foreign trade management system was an
important factor, leading to a multi-lateral market operation.
</P>
<P>
Exports of eight major items including fish, prawns, beef and
jellyfish were increased because of greater production.
</P>
<P>
Processing trade developed rapidly, with contract value rising
36.6 percent in the first half of the year.
</P>

Exports from the state-owned sector increased dramatically.

<HEADLINE> Ethnic Region Renews Land Contract System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in 9,326 villages, or 89
percent of the total number in north China's Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region, have renewed the land contract system with
local governments.
</P>
<P>
With farmland expanded to 4.7 million hectares, Inner Mongolia
is now a rising grain producer. Since the region introduced the
initiative-based land contract responsibility system in 1979, it
has become more than self-sufficient in grain, and on average has
supplied 3 billion kilos of grain annually to other parts of China
over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the central-government policy, at the
beginning of this year the regional government began to sign
renewed land contracts for another 30 years with farmers wishing
to do so.
</P>
<P>
The practice aims at stabilizing the household responsibility
contract system and arousing farmers' initiative for growing grain
crops.
</P>
<P>
With contracts renewed, farmers are willing to invest more in
contracted plots, and many raised funds to drill water wells,
improve soil and build irrigation canals and river dams.

<HEADLINE> Indian Firms to Be Allowed to Buy Back ECBs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 2 (Xinhua) -- India's Union Finance
Ministry is likely to allow selected corporations to buy back the
outstanding external commercial borrowings (ECBs) at an attractive
discount, official sources said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
As a safeguard against net outflow of foreign exchange, the
ministry would restrict the usage of this facility only to
corporations which have sufficient export receivables to finance
such deals.
</P>
<P>
Spreads are inversely proportional to the price of the bonds.
Accordingly, if the yields go up, there is a commensurate decline
in the price of the bonds - precisely what happened after
international investor sentiment turned adverse following the
Southeast Asian currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
In January, the Finance Ministry had briefly permitted
corporations to repurchase outstanding foreign loans. A
Mumbai-based industrial house had taken the opportunity to put out
an offer to repurchase over 300 million U.S. dollars of its
outstanding loans. It had sought to finance the deal by floating a
syndicated loan.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry later discontinued the facility in the
wake of rising pressure on the rupee (local currency).
</P>
<P>
In recent months, however, the spreads have widened further,
rendering repurchase of the outstanding bonds attractive.
</P>
<P>
The new ECBs facility has been restricted only to structural
loans or bonds and debentures, and not allowed for syndicated
loans, the sources added.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Foreign Investment Back on Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The first three quarters of
this year saw 1,100 new foreign investment projects launched in
Shanghai despite the impact of the Asian financial crisis,
according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
The contractual foreign investment in Shanghai between January
and September amounted to 5.1 billion U.S. dollars, about equal to
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
International giants such as Unilever, Volkswagen and Intel
have increased their investment by 1.26 billion dollars, said an
official in charge of Shanghai's foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, more than half the world's top 100 industrial
enterprises have projects in Shanghai, indicating rising
foreign-investor confidence in China over other Asian countries
and regions, some analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Figures show that about 3.68 billion U.S. dollars went to the
manufacturing sector, a 2.2-fold increase over the same period
last year, while the service sector, especially in properties,
declined due to adjustments in the investment structure made by
the municipal government.
</P>
<P>
Investment from the Asia-Pacific Region in the first nine
months decreased by 57.8 percent on an year-to-year basis, and
that of Japan was down 80 percent, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
However, the United States and Europe markedly expanded their
investment, and the U.S. and Germany have become the
major investors in Shanghai, accounting for 60 percent of the
city's total foreign investment.

<HEADLINE> Dental Diseases Prevalent in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Dental diseases are becoming
prevalent in the Tibet Autonomous Region, according to a recent
survey conducted by the Hunan Medical Sciences University in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
A medical examination to 477 Tibetan children between the ages
of seven and sixteen in Nyalam and Yadong counties in the
autonomous region showed that more than 60 percent of these
children suffer from dental caries.
</P>
<P>
According to survey director Cao Jin, the incidence of caries
in the region has reached the level of many modern cities in
China, and is on the rise.
</P>
<P>
Cao explained that with improved living conditions, Tibetans in
the richer areas have changed some aspects of their diets and now
consume more sugar. But they know little about dental protection
and are more vulnerable to dental diseases.
</P>
<P>
The incidence of dental fluorosis, however, usually
found in poorer regions, has greatly dropped to 25.86 percent and
17.18 percent among children in the two places surveyed, compared
with over 70 percent in the less developed regions of Tibet, said
Cao.
</P>
<P>
Experts have advised related departments to enhance medical
knowledge of residents in the autonomous region and help Tibetans
form good health habits.

<HEADLINE> Fiji's Economy Remains in Recession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Fiji's economy remains in
recession with output expected to contract by between three
percent and four percent this year, the Dominion reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Wellington-based newspaper quoted a latest news statement
issued by the Reserve Bank of Fiji in Suva as saying the cause of
the recession has been the eight-month-old drought which sees
sugar production fall this year by about 50 percent to the lowest
level in 30 years. The drastic reduction of sugar production has
affected other sectors of Fiji's economy.
</P>
<P>
Another cause is the impact of global economic conditions,
which have deteriorated sharply with many countries now either in
recession or with falling growth rates.
</P>
<P>
Fiji usually earns almost 150 million U.S. dollars from sugar,
the backbone of its economy, but industrial sources in Fiji
expect this would be halved this year because the prolonged
drought has destroyed thousands of hectares of sugar cane.
</P>
<P>
But, despite this, Fiji's foreign exchange reserves remains
strong, the Reserve Bank of Fiji said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the main features of Fiji's economy in
the past six months were the economy staying in recession:
foreign exchange reserves were strong; the exchange rate remained
competitive; consumption was weak and fell; wage increases were
moderate; and the agricultural sectors was weak but the tourism
and garment industries performed well.

<HEADLINE> Unemployment Rate in New Zealand Keeps Rising </HEADLINE>

<P>
WELLINGTON, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The unemployment rate in New
 Zealand rose from 7.7 percent in June to 8.1 percent in September
and is expected to peak at 8.8 percent in the middle of next year,
the Evening Post reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Wellington-based newspaper quoted a local economist as
saying that a weak domestic economy, troubled offshore markets
and tariff cuts are the main reasons for the lengthening jobless
queue.
</P>
<P>
According to the figures for June released by New Zealand's
Household Labor Force Survey, 140,600 New Zealanders were out of
work, WestpacTrust economist Paul Gardiner said. Data from the
latest survey for September, due to be released on Thursday, will
show unemployment has risen above eight percent to 147,600, he
added.
</P>
<P>
"Such a result will see the unemployment rate rise from 7.7
percent in June to 8.1 percent in September, the highest level
since the 1991 recession," Gardiner said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the labor market tends to lag behind economic
activity and therefore he expected the unemployment rate to move
higher in the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
"We expect the unemployment rate to peak at 8.8 percent in the
middle of next year," Gardiner said.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate in New Zealand would fall to 7.5 percent
by March 2000, according to the WestpacTrust economist.

<HEADLINE> Planning Commission Cuts Growth Targets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 2 (Xinhua) -- India's Planning Commission
has cut growth targets for some sectors in the Ninth Five-Year
Plan (1998-2002) due to the industrial slowdown in the country,
Business Standard Monday quoted official sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The growth target for the manufacturing sector during the
period has been slashed from an annual average growth of 9.7
percent to 8.5 percent. This means much reduced growth in
1998-2002 compared with the Eight Five-Year Plan period, when
manufacturing sector crossed the targeted 9.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The final draft of the plan envisages a reduction in the growth
target of gross domestic product (GDP) from 7 to 6.7 percent per
year. The commission has also changed the growth projections for
the transportation industry and savings by the public, household
and private corporate sectors. The biggest cut is in the growth
target for public sector savings - from 2.8 to 1.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The plan panel has decided to decrease the growth target of
10.6 percent for electricity, gas and water marginally. But it
will keep the agriculture growth target of 4.5 percent intact.
"Though agriculture has not done as well as was expected, this
sector is capable of bouncing back and showing much higher growth
rates in the next three years," said an expert.
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission is expected to submit the draft for
approval by the Union cabinet in the second week of this month.
The reasons for revising the GDP target are the recent salary
hikes of central and State government officials and the industrial
slowdown of 1997-98. "The rate of industrial growth was 5 percent
last year and is expected to be 5.5 percent this year. We do not
expect a dramatic improvement in the next three years of the Ninth
Five-Year Plan," a plan panel expert said.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka to Discuss Trade Imbalance with Bangkok </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Trade imbalance against Dhaka is
expected to top the agenda for the forthcoming meeting of
Bangladesh-Thailand Joint Commission (JC) to be held in Thai
capital of Bangkok, press reports here said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Bangladeshi Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad will leave here
for Bangkok Tuesday as head of a team to the sixth meeting of the
JC established in 1982.
</P>
<P>
Azad and his Thai counterpart will review the entire spectrum
of bilateral relations as well as regional and international
issues of common concern, officials were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
They are expected to exchange views on the areas of cooperation
of the BIMSTEC (Bangladesh-India-Myanmar-Sri Lank-Thailand
Economic Cooperation), a new regional grouping launched in Bangkok
in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
The JC meeting would discuss the overall bilateral trade,
paying special attention to a huge gap in the two-way trade, they
said.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Bangladesh imported goods worth 135.86 million U.S.
dollars from Thailand and exported items valued at 14.57 million
dollars to that country.
</P>
<P>
Bangladeshi side is likely to request Thailand to purchase more
commodities from the country in a move to remove the imbalance in
trade in phases.
</P>
<P>
The commodities Bangladesh can export to Thailand in larger
quantum include tea, jute goods, shrimps, frozen fish, crabs,
tortoise, leather, jute yarn, twin and readymade garments.
</P>
<P>
The two sides may discuss ways for increasing trade through
private sectors.
</P>
<P>
Matters relating to fish projects and investment in Bangladesh
will also come up for discussion in the meeting, they said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the meeting agenda will include liquefied petroleum
gas project, maritime, cooperation and civil aviation affairs,
they added.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Ranks First in Coffee Export in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has become the biggest
coffee exporter in Asia and ranks second in Asia in terms of
coffee production, local media reports said.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam exported over 390,400 tones of coffee beans in the
1997-98 crop, earning more than 594 million U.S. dollars. The
annual coffee crop lasts from October to September of the
following year.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's coffee exports increased by 13 percent in quantity
and 43.5 percent in value compared with the previous crop.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's coffee has been shipped to 52 countries worldwide
with 82 percent going to the United States, Germany, Spain,
Britain, Italy, Poland, France, Austria, the Republic of Korea and
Japan.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Vietnam has about 300,000 hectares of coffee and
plans to expand the acreage to 350,000 hectares by 2005 to bring
the national coffee output to 420,000-450,000 tones per crop.
</P>
<P>
The reports said this year's prolonged drought may cause losses
of 80,000-100,000 tones of beans in the coming 1998-1999 crop.
However, coffee growers still cherish a hope to harvest
380,000-400,000 tones of beans and export 560 million dollars of
coffee in the 1998-1999 crop.

<HEADLINE> Astronauts Put Sun-Gazing Satellite Into Space </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Two U.S. astronauts Sunday
released the sun-gazing Spartan satellite into space,
accomplishing a job left over from last year.
</P>
<P>
Spartan, on its second shuttle flight in less than a year,
was supposed to spend two days studying the sun last November in
an orbit near the shuttle, but a series of mistakes by astronauts
rendered it useless, and two astronauts had to go out to get it
back.
</P>
<P>
NASA said that that mistake will not happen again, as they have
improved the computer software for Spartan and the directions for
its release from the shuttle.
</P>
<P>
Astronaut Stephen Robinson used the 50-foot robot arm to drop
the satellite into space, with help from Dr. Scott Parazynski on
the computers.
</P>
<P>
The 3,000-pound satellite did a pirouette as it entered space,
suggesting that everything was working properly. Discovery then
slowly backed away. The release took place at 340 miles (547
kilometers) over Baja, California.
</P>
<P>
The 11 million U.S. dollar satellite will collect images of the
sun's outer atmosphere, the corona, and charged particles
streaming from the sun out into the space.

<HEADLINE> German Parties Form State Coalition Governmet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Both the German Social
Democratic Party and the Party for Democratic Socialism (PDS) have
endorsed a pact reached on Saturday to form a coalition government
in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania State.
</P>
<P>
The endorsement of the pact by the two parties has cleared all
hurdles for the PDS's return to the state-level government since
Germany's reunification in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The Social Democrats approved the pact Saturday at a conference
in the eastern German state, with 61 of the 91 delegates attending
the conference voted for the pact.
</P>
<P>
The PDS endorsed the pact with a two-third majority in its
conference at Parchim. A hundred out of the 114 delegates at the
conference voted in favor of the deal.
</P>
<P>
The PDS is the successor to the former Communist Party in the
former East Germany before the fall of the Berlin Wall.
</P>
<P>
Harald Ringstorff, Social Democrats' Minister-President nominee
in the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, expressed his
satisfaction over the voting.
</P>
<P>
The agreement on a coalition government with the PDS includes
"unprecedented social democratic policies," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ringstorff is expected to be elected Minister-President of the
new state government on Tuesday by the state legislature.
</P>
<P>
Gregor Gysi, leader of the PDS group in German parliament,
described the pact's approval as a "historic turning point," which
set a precedent in the political process in the eastern part of
Germany.
</P>
<P>
But the PDS is still an opposition party in the federal
republic as a whole, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Social Democrats seized 27 and the PDS 20 of the 71 seats
in the state legislature in the September 27 state legislature
election. The two parties jointly enjoy an overwhelming majority
in the newly elected state legislature.

<HEADLINE> Round-Up: Myanmar Strives to Develop Tourism Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar government has been
taking various measures for the development the tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is rich in scenic beauties and cultural heritage. It
boasts of many tourist attractions including the world known
Shwedagon Pagoda, Mandalay royal city and Bagan, a city of
pagodas.
</P>
<P>
Despite its rich resources, Myanmar's tourism industry remained
undeveloped due to various reasons after the country regained
independence in 1948.
</P>
<P>
During the 40 years between 1948 and 1988, the number of
foreign tourists to the country was 30,000 annually, bringing the
country less than 10 million U.S. dollars of foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
After the Myanmar State Law and Order Restoration Council
(SLORC),  the present State Peace and Development Council (SPDC),
took over the state power in late 1988, it carried out a major
reform in its economic policy including that of tourism.
</P>
<P>
First it extended the period of stay for foreign visitors in
Myanmar from seven days to 14 days in May 1989. In 1993 the period
of tourist visa was further extended to 28 days. The moves were
aimed at giving foreign travelers sufficient time to stay in
Myanmar and thus helping the country earn more foreign exchange
from their spending.
</P>
<P>
In June 1990, Myanmar promulgated its first Tourism Law since
independence to govern and guarantee the tourism business.
</P>
<P>
A new Ministry of Hotels and Tourism was set up in September
1992 to oversee the tourism business, which used to be run by a
company of hotels and tourism under the Ministry of Trade. The
formation of the new ministry has strengthened the macroscopical
direction of tourism activities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government also encourages the local private
sector and foreign entrepreneurs to involve in the tourism
industry. Before 1988, tourism was monopolized by the state. After
that year, the government has allowed both local and foreign
private sectors to do business in tourism, which has helped create
more job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
By the end of April this year, licenses have been issued to 449
hotels, motels and inns, of which more than 20 hotels are run with
foreign investment from companies of Singapore, Thailand, Japan,
Malaysia and China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
There are now one foreign travel agency, 626 local and 15
local-foreign joint ventures operating in hotel and tourism in
Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment in the sector, with Singapore in the first
place, amounted to 1.1 billion dollars in 40 projects by the end
of June this year, compared with the country's total foreign
investment of more than 7 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has also opened to tourists more new sites such as
Sittwe, Mrauk Oo, Kyaikhtiyo, Myitkyina, Pathein and Chaungtha
Beach.
</P>
<P>
Yangon as the capital is no longer the only gateway to Myanmar
and entry by land has been allowed through border points with
China such as Bhamo, Namkham, Muse, Kyuhkok, Kunlong, Mongla and
those with Thailand such as Tachilek, Phaya Thonzu, Myawaddy and
Kawthoung.
</P>
<P>
To improve the tourism environment, Myanmar has renovated the
Yangon International Airport and built two more international
airports -- the Hanthawaddy airport in Bago, 80 kilometers from
Yangon, and the Mandalay airport, 680 km from the capital.
</P>
<P>
As part of its endeavors to promote the tourism industry,
Myanmar has established more aviation links with capital cities of
other countries, especially in 1995 and 1996 before the country's
first tourist year campaign was launched.
</P>
<P>
In these two years, Myanmar was able to open air links with
Brunei, Bhutan, India, Japan, Laos, Malaysia and Pakistan in
addition to those with Bangladesh, China, Singapore and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's domestic private airlines have also extended their
flights to border towns of neighboring Thailand, and Thai charter
planes are allowed to land at Myanmar's tourist sites since 1993.
</P>
<P>
The country has built more hotels to bring the total hotel
number to 523 with 14,714 rooms, compared with 39 hotels with
1,240 rooms in 1988.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the above measures, more than 200,000 foreign
travelers visited Myanmar annually in the last few years by air,
while the number of visitors entering through border points
exceeded 300,000.
</P>
<P>
Although the number of international visitors and high-class
hotels has increased, Myanmar still lacks trained personnel in the
industry.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore Tourism Board and Singapore Hotels and Tourism
Education Center have been helping Myanmar in training more than
1,100 local students under a tourism cooperation agreement between
the two countries, and have turned out 38 diploma holders in hotel
management for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Myanmar initiated accords on cooperation in tourism
with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and Thailand in
January and July respectively.
</P>
<P>
To attract more tourists from major tourist supplying
countries, Myanmar launched travel shows in Singapore and Thailand
successively in August and September.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian students have
received the bulk of scholarships from an emergency scholarship
fund provided by the British government for Asian students
affected by the region's economic crisis, a national daily
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The fund, which awarded scholarships amounting to 2.8 million
British pound (4.704 million U.S. dollars) to needy students from
selected Asian countries for the 1998-1999 academic year, has
disbursed a sum of 1.35 million British pound (2.268 million U.S.
dollars), almost half of the total amount, to Malaysian students
whose education has been affected by the economic crisis, the
local English Daily "New Straits Times" said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,583 Malaysian students pursuing undergraduate and
postgraduate studies in the United Kingdom got the awards from the
scholarship fund set up by the British government in May to assist
students from Malaysia, Indonesia, South Korea and Thailand who
were unable to continue their studies because of the economic
crisis at home, according to the leading national daily.
</P>
<P>
There are about 7,000 Malaysian students in the United Kingdom,
of whom some 4,000 are privately sponsored, it said.

<HEADLINE> French Pharmaceutical Company Walks Away from Tianjin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Fierce competition has forced
Russel-Uclaf, a French multinational pharmaceutical company, to
withdraw from the China dexamethasone market that it dominated for
two decades.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned Tianjin Pharmaceutical Corporation (TPC) in
Tianjin, north China's port city, broke into the European market
last year after 20 years of bitter competition with the French
counterpart.
</P>
<P>
"My company started to have a leading role in China in 1994,
and Russel-Uclaf lost millions of dollars in the price war that
occured afterward. Russel-Uclaf's attempt to regain its previous
market share also turned out be a Waterloo," said Shi Chunsheng,
president of the Tianjin company.
</P>
<P>
However, the Tianjin company, the largest Chinese producer of
dexamethasone, was kicked out of the game by Russel-Uclaf in 1982
and had to shut down its production lines.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, Tianjin Pharmaceutical Corporation resumed production
of the product, after having introduced advanced production lines
from abroad.
</P>
<P>
Now, TPC has more than a 90 percent share of China's
dexamethasone market, and five percent of the total Asian market,
said Shi Chunsheng, president of Tianjin Pharmaceutical
Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Shi said that TPC's output value will reach one billion yuan
annually by the year 2000.

<P>
MANAGUA, Nicaragua, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Over 1,000 people
were confirmed dead in Central America Sunday after heavy rains
brought by hurricane Mitch ripped through the area.
</P>
<P>
Official reports have put the death toll at 254 in Honduras,
696 in Nicaragua, 144 in El Salvador, 21 in Guatemala and seven in
Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
Across Nicaragua, flood waters cut off many roads and bridges
and destroyed thousands of homes.

<P>
A lake in a volcano crater in northern Nicaragua overflowed on
Friday and sent mud and rock roaring down on villages below.
</P>
<P>
By Sunday, over 400 people were reportedly confirmed dead in
the flooded areas.
</P>
<P>
In Honduras, officials appealed for emergency relief supplies
for the more than 1.5 million people evacuated or stranded by the
storm.
</P>
<P>
Authorities throughout the region called for aid as rescue
workers struggled to bring food and medical supplies to the tens
of thousands of people left homeless by Mitch.

<P>
HAIKOU, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Sanya, a beach resort on the
provincial island of Hainan, is becoming greener.
</P>
<P>
With its blue waters and silky beaches, Sanya at the southern tip
of the Hainan Island is known as the "Hawaii of the Orient" and
is one of the most popular tourist destinations in China.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show that by June the city had had 790
hectares of trees and 830 hectares of green areas, with forest
cover approaching 50 percent and per capita public greenery
reaching 10 square meters.
</P>
<P>
The city has accelerated its afforestation drive in recent
years. Last year, over 4,000 coconut trees were planted to form a
"Coconut Tree Dream Corridor" along the major beach front, in
addition to 30,000 square meters of lawns and over 6,600
hectares of trees planted on the surrounding mountains.

<HEADLINE> Hainan Starts New Round of Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Southernmost China's island
province of Hainan has unveiled a new round of moderate economic
growth, coming after bubbles in the local economy erupted in the
early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xiaofeng, governor of Hainan, said that the province's
gross domestic product (GDP) reached 29.4 billion yuan in the
first nine months of this year, considerably above the country's
average.
</P>
<P>
This figure was also a 7.7 percent gain over the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
Hainan will be able to realize the goal of maintaining an 8
percent economic growth rate this year because the province's
industrial structure adjustment measures have taken effect, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Hainan's economy has ended a low-growth period that began
in the early 1990s when speculation in the local real estate
sector ran away from the island," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the province's economic growth rate reached a
record low, 4.3 percent, in 1995, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, investment in the local real estate industry resumed
growth in the past three quarters this year, and industrial
enterprises have seen profits as a whole after three successive
years of losses.
</P>
<P>
Investment in fixed assets also began to rise again, Wang said,
adding that the economy of Hainan has moved onto the right track
of healthy development.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Rice Imports May be Cut by 50 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia will be able to halve
its huge rice imports next fiscal year, beginning on April 1999,
if rice production meets the target, the Jakarta Post Monday
quoted Minister of Agriculture Soleh Solahuddin as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We can reduce our imports by 50 percent if our rice (unhusked)
production could reach 52 million tons next fiscal year," the
minister said in South Sumatra provincial capital of Palembang on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The unhusked rice could be processed into 31 million metric
tons of milled rice. Indonesia's rice consumption is expected to
reach 32 million tons next year.
</P>
<P>
This year, domestic consumption is predicted at 31 million
tons, while the country's unhusked rice production could only
reach slightly over 46 million tons (28 million tons of milled
rice) due to the poor harvests.
</P>
<P>
To make up for the shortage, the government plans to import as
much as 4.1 million tons for the fiscal year ending in March 1999.
</P>
<P>
The central Bureau of Statistics in its latest report estimates
that the country's unhusked rice production this year will reach
46.44 million tons, slightly higher than its earlier prediction of
46.29 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The figure is still six percent lower than the 49.38 million
tons last year.
</P>
<P>
The State Logistics Agency earlier predicted that the country
would have to import at least 3.42 million tons of rice in
1999/2000 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Soleh said the government had conducted special efforts to
increase the size of the rice cultivation areas in a bid to boost
production.

<HEADLINE> Telephone Installation Fee Drops in Hainan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Telecommunication authorities in
Hainan Province have decided to dramatically cut the fee charged for
opening up a telephone line.
</P>
<P>
As of November 1, urban telephone users will pay 1,000 yuan
(120.48 U.S. dollars) for their first telephone line, as compared
with the present 2,000 to 2,500 yuan. The cost to users in rural
townships and villages will drop from 1,500 to 600 yuan.
 The fee for setting up a mobile phone line will be cut from 1,500
to 1,000 yuan, but this price can fluctuate within a range of 20 to
30 percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, telephone availability averaged 8.3 lines for every
100 person in the island province. The past five years have seen
an additional 130,000 mobile-phone users and 430,000 pager
users.

<HEADLINE> Northeastern China Cracks Down On Electricity Theft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, November 2 (Xinhua) -- An official with a glass fibre
factory in the city of Benxi in northeastern China was recently
detained when he instructed electricians to steal electricity by
tapping into public power lines.
</P>
<P>
This was just one of the 9,796 cases of electricity theft
exposed during a major crackdown campaign launched recently by
electricity management in northeastern China where power theft
has cost the Northeastern Electricity Group (NEG), the regional
major power producer and supplier, over 300 million yuan (about
37.5 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
To reduce production costs, some enterprises resort to this
practice, and according to NEG officials, about half of companies
in the service industry such as restaurants, hotels, and ballrooms
are engaged in electricity embezzlement. Some simply plug into the
transformers.
</P>
<P>
NEG officials have allocated some 80 million yuan to reinforce
crackdown efforts and close loopholes. They have set up special
inspection units across the region, probing into major cases in
collaboration with the local police, and plan to install meters on
all transformers by the end of the year.

<HEADLINE> Jakarta Markets See Nervous Week, Says Analysts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The Jakarta money and stock
markets expect thin trading with political concerns sidelining
players this week, the Indonesian Observer Monday quoted analysts
as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Players will adopt a wait-and-see attitude, watching the
political developments. They are worried that the condition will
heat up ahead of the MPR (People's Consultative Assembly) special
session," money market analyst Farial Anwar said.
</P>
<P>
The MPR will begin its special session on November 10 and
conclude it November 13. During the meeting a date will be set for
next year's general election.
</P>
<P>
"People won't sell their U.S. dollars because they think that
once the political tension worsens, the U.S. dollar will rise
again," Farial said.
</P>
<P>
A massive student demonstration last week sent the markets
reeling as investors took a back seat after cashing out. The
protesters asked President B.J. Habibie to immediately hand over
power to a transitional government and reiterated their rejection
of the MPR special session.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the possibility of larger student protests keeps
the sentiment weak on both the rupiah and the stocks.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody dares short selling on dollar. Although the rupiah does
have the potentials to strengthen, nobody has the guts to take a
short dollar position at this level because of political
uncertainties," Farial added.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah closed at 7,700/7,750 to the greenback on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jakarta stocks are expected to see a bearish week
with investors taking a back seat.
</P>
<P>
Dominant political factors will result in a market correction
this week, fund manager Ario Adhikari told the Indonesian
Observer.

<HEADLINE> Thai Opposition ready to Grill Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BANGKOK, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The Thai opposition claims it
has plenty of ammunition to grill the government at a censure
debate planned for late this month.
</P>
<P>
Chalerm Yubamrung, deputy leader of the New Aspiration Party,
was quoted Monday by the Bangkok Post as saying that his party has
told its MPs to gather information to grill heavyweight ministers
involved in shady deals.
</P>
<P>
However, it has yet to decide whether it should censure the
entire cabinet or individual ministers.
</P>
<P>
"now, we have a list of targeted ministers. We have already
delegated duties to our debaters. During the debate, we will show
the public how these ministers have been involved in shady deals,"
Chalerm said.
</P>
<P>
"the economic problems remain unresolved. The export volume is
low. There is no foreign investment. How can our baht become
strong? This show that the government doesn't know how to handle
the economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the opposition wanted to inspect the work of the
government, not to overthrow it.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, New Aspiration Secretary-General Sanoh Thienthong
said both options--grilling the entire cabinet or individual
ministers in the censure debate--will affect Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai, in his capacity as head of the coalition.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Pete Sampras became the man with
a mission going into the Paris Open Indoor tennis tournament
which started off here today.
</P>
<P>
If he successfully defends his title, the current world number
one will move a step forward to his dream of ending the year in
the top spot for a record sixth consecutive time.
</P>
<P>
Last year, after clinching the Paris Open and the following
ATP Tour world championship title, Sampras tied the record set by
his fellow American Jimmy Connors through 1974-1978 of occupying
world number one spot for five years in a row.
</P>
<P>
Sampras had already lost chances to boost his computer points
by crashing out of the Eurocard Open semifinals last week. But to
his comfort, two major rivals Chilean Marcelo Rios and Australian
Patrick Rafter, currently second and third in the world
respectively, also failed to win.
</P>
<P>
The three-horse battle for the men's top ranking will continue
this week at the Paris Open and may only be decided at the
season-ending world championship starting on November 23 in
Hanover, Germany.
</P>
<P>
Sampras has a tricky start on his defending rout, with his
first round opponent Thomas Johansson of Sweden. He is drawn to
meet Rafter in the quarterfinals, and waiting for him in the
semifinals will be either Rios or Dutchman Richard Krajicek, who
ousted him at the Eurocard and preserves a career edge over him.

YANGON, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar Investment
Commission (MIC) has prohibited enterprises doing business in the
country from re-selling their motor vehicles imported with tax
relief or tax exemption.
</P>
<P>
A latest issue of the local Myanmar Business News, published by
the Union of Myanmar Chamber of Commerce and Industry, quoted a
directive of the MIC as warning that the motor vehicles in
question will be confiscated and entrepreneurs will be fined
unless the directive is followed.
</P>
<P>
The directive said that the enterprises are required to apply
to the MIC in case of re-sale of the vehicles and then pay the
prescribed customs duty and taxes as well as import of new ones.
</P>
<P>
The companies are to abide by the decision of the MIC passed
for individual cases for payment of duty and taxes, the directive
added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Myanmar authorities have also banned use of cars
imported under the transit trade system since September 1997,
saying that cars imported under the system could only be
transported across Myanmar to a third country.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, in 1997-98 fiscal year which
ended in March, the number of motor vehicles operating in Myanmar

<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Geologists have discovered a
rare white marble forest more than 400 million years old in
Guangling County in northern China's Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The white marble forest, unique in China, is located on a
2,175-meter-high mountain about 250 kilometers from Taiyuan, the
provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
Qian Fan, a specialist from the Chinese Academy of Geological
Sciences, said after field investigations with his colleagues that
the forest is several hundred meters long and dozens of meters
wide.
</P>
<P>
He said the highest pillar-shaped white marble group is over a
dozen meters and the lowest about two meters high.
</P>
<P>
Qian said the white marble reserve is 9.96 million cubic
meters, making it the third largest of its kind in the world.
</P>
<P>
Geologists said the discovery of the white marble forest also
proves late Chinese leading geologist Li Siguang's inference that
Datong Prefecture, where the marble forest is located, witnessed
large earth-crust movement during the glacier age.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Citizens Withdrawing from the Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai citizens, once
enthusiastic stock investors, are gradually withdrawing their
money from the stock market and increasing deposits in local
banks, according to local sources.
</P>
<P>
According to a report, deposits in local banks increased by an
average of 1,400 yuan per person in the first half this year, 4.5
times that for the same period last year. However, money invested
in buying securities dropped to around 1,300 yuan, down 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
A local official said that local citizens are very sensitive to
the negative impact the Asian financial crisis has had on the
stock market and tend to invest their money in safer ways. At the
same time, people are showing less interest in instant
consumption, which also accounts for the increase in local bank

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Rejects Territory Claims by Russian Deputies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry
Sunday rejected territory claims by some Russian State Duma
(parliament) deputies, saying that the demands were not conducive
to mutual confidence and understanding of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
In a statement the Foreign Ministry referred to claims made by
some Russian deputies over Ukraine's Crimea and Sevastopol when
the State Duma met on October 23 to review a Russian-Ukrainian
agreement on early warning systems for missile attacks and
space-monitoring system.
</P>
<P>
The statement complained that a number of deputies make the
same claims from time to time when the State Duma discusses
Russo-Ukrainian relations.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministry said it hoped the Russian executive branch
would make appropriate responses to the anti-Ukraine remarks.
</P>
<P>
It also expressed puzzlement and concern over the State Duma's
delay in ratifying the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and
Partnership signed by Russian President Boris Yeltsin and his
Ukrainian counterpart Leonid Kuchma on May 31, 1997.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Calls For More Patience </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie Sunday reminded the country of the need for patience and
direction as the country nears the special session of the People's
Consultative Assembly (MPR).
</P>
<P>
Addressing the national conference of the Indonesian Islamic
Propagation Council here, the president called on religious
leaders to understand and lend direction to what he called
"people's dynamism."
</P>
<P>
He said the country is facing several important political
events, including the special session of the MPR, the general
election in mid-1999 and the presidential election in late
December 1999.
</P>
<P>
In the run-up to these national events, the political
temperature normally tends to rise, national newspapers Monday
quoted the president as saying.
</P>
<P>
While Habibie and some 400 members of the council gathered at
the State Palace on Sunday, over 5,000 members of the Islamic
Supporters of the Constitution staged a pro-Habibie rally in
Central Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
The gathering followed a large anti-Habibie protest held last
Wednesday when 8,000 students demonstrated outside the Parliament
House, demanding the establishment of a transitional government.
The demonstrators also rejected the coming special session of the
MPR, the country's highest legislative body.
</P>
<P>
The MPR will begin its special session on November 10 and
conclude it November 13. During the meeting a date will be set for
next year's general election.
</P>
<P>
Various parties have been at odds over the need for the
session, with some demanding that it be canceled.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian political observers have warned that conflict among
political forces may lead to unrest during the upcoming special
session of the MPR.
</P>
<P>
"Collisions between various mass groups before the special
session could lead to bloodshed and the paralysis of all state
systems, unless the government take concrete steps to prevent it
happening," Merdeka daily Sunday quoted former home affairs
minister Rudini as saying.
</P>
<P>
Rudini suggested that the government establish a national
consensus involving leading figures from the political
establishment and the opposition as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Muslim scholar Nurcholish Madjid and politician Mochtar Buchori
raised the issue of possible unrest in a discussion held on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Nurcholish said the special session could be marked with unrest
if there were indications that the event was contrived only to
maintain Habibie's position in power.
</P>
<P>
Habibie, however, could avert the catastrophe with fair and
open play, and by keeping his promise to hold the general election
in May next year as scheduled, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mochtar said physical clashes could take place given that many
parties have already begun to trade threats.
</P>
<P>
He said Indonesians must learn how to establish a civil society
in peaceful ways. "We are still learning. So I would not be
surprised if there was unrest because of the many interests
involved," he added.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Minister of Security and Defense and Armed Forces
Commander Gen. Wiranto said that the Armed Forces is ready to
safeguard the special session from any effort to disrupt the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Regarding demonstrations, he said recent rallies staged by
various parties were actually shows of force which could lead to
anarchy.
</P>
<P>
"It is not forbidden to stage protests, but they must abide by
the regulations," he added.

<HEADLINE> Farmer Detained for Illegal Tree Felling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The forestry police in the city
of Mianyang in southwest China's Sichuan Province have detained a
farmer suspected of illegal tree felling.
</P>
<P>
The forestry police said that Zhong Dailin has been detained
for illegally cutting down 71 trees which protect the Yangtze
River and running a lumber processing factory for large profits.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan is located at the upper reach of the Yangtze and
the forests there play an important role in preventing
soil erosion, one of the factors responsible for the heavy
flooding on the river this past summer.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan possesses one of China's three largest forest areas.
</P>
<P>
The police said his actions violate the regulations adopted by
the State Council.
</P>
<P>
They are now investigating the case, and if the alleged facts
prove true, Zhong will be punished under the law.
</P>
<P>
The province imposed a tree-felling ban in its primitive
forests on September 1, and the Provincial People's Congress
adopted a law to punish offenders.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Riot Team to Announce Findings Tuesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian
government-sponsored fact-finding team investigating the country's
May riots is scheduled to submit its executive report to the
government on Tuesday, the Indonesian Observer Monday quoted the
team leader as saying.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview with the paper on Sunday, the Joint
Fact-Finding Team leader Marzuki Darusman said the team will "most
likely" deliver their executive report to the government at the
Ministry of Justice.
</P>
<P>
The team was formed on July 23 under a joint decree by the
Defense and Security Ministry, Justice Ministry, Attorney
General's Office, and the ministries of women affairs, home
affairs and foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
"Five officials have confirmed they will attend the meeting...
with the exception of (Home Affairs Minister) Syarwan Hamid who
will not be present due to an out of town official trip," Marzuki
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the team has never received an opportunity "as big as
this one" for an official meeting with the government's
representatives.
</P>
<P>
Mandated to report to the government on October 23, the team
has been twice delayed in the announcement of their findings due
to a conflict in the schedule for a final meeting between the six
government representatives.
</P>
<P>
Marzuki has dismissed reports of an internal rift between
members of the team, saying that the postponement "was not a
result of a split within the team."
</P>
<P>
"The delays have taken place due to the team's (difference of
opinions) in the 'designing' of the report's final draft," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The 18-member team was entrusted with the task of investigating
and, if possible, unveiling the instigators and perpetrators of
the May riots, which some say were organized.
</P>
<P>
The team is also investigating claims made by human rights
groups that there were rampant sexual assaults and rapes during
the riots which killed 1,200 people and led to the downfall of
former president Soeharto.

WASHINGTON, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Kenya swept the top two
spots in the New York City Marathon on Sunday with John Kagwe
edging Joseph Chebet in the final strides with a time of two
hours eight minutes and 45 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Kagwe, the hot pre-race favorite, geared up to beat his rival
to defend his title in the second-closest finish in the race's

Chebet finished only three seconds in Kagwe's wake, repeating
the same rankings last year. Zebedayo Bayo of Tanzania placed

half saw 1996 Olympic champion Josie Thugwane of South Africa and
1997 world champion Abel Anton of Spain lead the field.
</P>
<P>
But with 22 kilometers to go, five runners from Kenya
controled the race. In the final stage, Kagwe, Chebet and Bayo
dropped the other runners for good, and had a tough battle among
themselves.
</P>
<P>
Kagwe and Fiacconi each collected 50,000 U.S. dollars for the
first prize.
</P>
<P>
In the women's event, Franca Fiacconi of Italy took the title

<HEADLINE> Gascoigne Booked on Return after Rehab </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Paul Gascoigne, ending his life
in a rehabilitation clinic, had a yellow card in Middlesbrough's
1-1 draw with Nottingham Forest in an English Premier League
match on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Less than a month after he started treatment for stress,
alcohol problems and depression at the clinic, the England
midfielder returned to action as his team were shocked by a
dramatic late Forest equaliser.
</P>
<P>
Middlesbrough seemed to be heading towards three points when
Gascoigne was substituted in the 78th minute. But an 89th minute
goal from Forest teenager Marlon Harewood cancelled out the home
side's 22nd minute goal by Brian Deane.
</P>
<P>
Gascoigne looked delighted to be back, smiling and joking with
some of Forest's players in the tunnel before running out on to
the pitch. He played a largely reserved first half, showing just
a few touches of his passing skills.
</P>
<P>
But the midfielder, who spent 16 days in the clinic in
mid-October and will continue to be treated, was booked early in
the second half for a poor tackle on Scot Gemmill, before being
substituted.
</P>
<P>
After dominating the first half, Middlesbrough, promoted to
the top flight last season, seemed to lose direction in the
second half against Forest, 18th in the 20-team league.
</P>
<P>
Deane, who joined Middlesbrough from Benfica last month, took
his goal well, firing the ball into the right-hand corner from
close range after a superb long pass from Andy Townsend, who
upstaged Gascoigne in midfield.
</P>
<P>
But Harewood turned well in the area to fire in a vital
equaliser and went close to scoring a dramatic winner in the
dying seconds.
</P>
<P>
Despite the draw, Middlesbrough moved up to fourth with 17
points from their first 11 games, three points behind
third-placed Arsenal and five points behind leaders Aston Villa.

<HEADLINE> World's First Global Satellite Telephone, Paging Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 1 (Xinhua) -- A Bermuda-based U.S.
company announced Sunday that its hand-held, global satellite
phone and paging system, the world's first, is now commercially
available to customers.
</P>
<P>
Iridium World Communications said in a statement that it offers
satellite voice, cellular roaming and calling card and other
services 24 hours a day and seven days a week by using its
constellation of 66 low earth orbit satellites. Phones are being
produced and shipped to the regional Iridium Gateways by Motorola
of the U.S. and Kyocera of Japan. Global page service will
commence in mid-November.
</P>
<P>
Whether their phone is in satellite or cellular mode, the
company said, an Iridium customer will be reachable at a single
phone number, anywhere they happen to be. If their phone is turned
off, they can be contacted on their Iridium pager.
</P>
<P>
Iridium satellite service is authorized in more than 120
countries and regions, with 200 markets expected by year-end, the
company said. More than 270 distribution agreements have been
negotiated worldwide, with service providers and roaming partners,
which provide Iridium access to over 105 million wireless
telephone customers in 125 countries.
</P>
<P>
Customers can select the communication options among services
including satellite, cellular, paging and landline.
</P>
<P>
A direct satellite link to a handheld satellite phone provides
incoming and outgoing communications in remote areas, poorly
covered regions and other locations where terrestrial networks are
not available.
</P>
<P>
Its roaming service allows customers to roam across previously
incompatible terrestial wireless networks, enabling them to keep
one telephone number and receive one telephone bill for calls made
anywhere.
</P>
<P>
Iridium pager service will provide global alphanumeric
messaging to belt-worn pagers. When combined with the voice mail
option, callers can reach the customers worldwide, including on
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Its calling card enables customers to make phone calls from
public and private wireline and wireless phones in 58 countries.
</P>
<P>
The company said that it had worked for 11 years before being
operational. "Iridium will open up the world of business,
commerce, disaster relief and humanitarian assistance" with its
service, the company said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton says All Options Open to Deal with Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Sunday said Iraq's decision to suspend cooperation with U.N. arms
inspectors violated its commitments to the United Nations and all
options remained open for dealing with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also said he was pleased that the U.S. Security Council
had strongly condemned Iraq's action. He made the remarks in an
interview with the American Urban Radio network.
</P>
<P>
"It's a clear violation of the commitments that he (Iraq
President Saddam Hussein) made, a clear violation of the U.N.
Security Council resolutions," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"I personally am very pleased that the U.N. Security Council,
including some people that I think have been a little tolerant
with him in the past, strongly condemned what he did," the
president said.
</P>
<P>
"From my point of view, we should keep all our options open,
examine the nature of the action and where we are, and then do
what's best for the integrity of the United Nations and the
interest, the security interests of the people of the United
States," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he had received a couple of briefings on the
issue, and that his national security team was meeting late on
Sunday afternoon for further discussions.
</P>
<P>
Also on Sunday, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen returned
to Washington after cutting short an Asian tour.
</P>
<P>
"I think everybody is getting weary of dealing with (Iraqi
President) Saddam Hussein," Cohen told reporters at Andrews Air
Force Base.
</P>
<P>
He said Washington would prefer any action against Iraq to be
taken in concert with the United Nations and allies, but a
unilateral U.S. attack "has always been an option that we could
pursue."
</P>
<P>
"He (Saddam) continues to flout the rules. He continues to
break agreement after agreement, and I think that we are concerned
about this," Cohen said.
</P>

PRISTINA, Yugoslavia November 1 (Xinhua) -- Two Yugoslav
journalists have been sentenced to 60-day imprisonment by a
martial court of the ethnic Albanian rebels, a Serbian official
said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Radovan Urosevic, Director of the Pristina Media Center, told
Xinhua that the two reporters for Tanjug, the Yugoslav news agency
was sentenced on Saturday by the court of Kosovo Liberation Army
for disobeying KLA order while driving in its controlled area.
</P>
<P>
Tanjug said that its journalists disappeared on October 16 when
they were covering the Kosovo Crisis.
</P>
<P>
Urosevic said that by sentencing the two journalists, KLA
wanted to show to the world that it was a major factor in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"It is unbelievable that the Western countries have turned a
blind eye to such illegal act", which constituted a breach of the
agreement on Kosovo reached by Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic and U.S. Special Envoy Richard Holbrooke, he said.

<HEADLINE> Turnout Considered Key in Close Races in Tuesday Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Voter turnout, traditionally
low in midterm elections, could have significant impact on the
results of those close races in the November 3 midterm elections
in the United States, lawmakers said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Higher turnout is usually seen as helping Democrats, although
Republicans predicted their final-week campaign commercials,
including spots linking Democrats to the Clinton-Lewinsky matter,
would help attract more voters sympathetic to Republican
candidates.
</P>
<P>
"Our Republicans are energized," said Representative John
Linder, head of the House Republican campaign effort.
</P>
<P>
Both sides said turnout would be crucial in close races.
Representative Martin Frost, Linder's Democratic counterpart, said
many House districts will be decided by 1,000 or 2,000 votes.
"We're working turnout very hard. They are working turnout very
hard," he said on ABC's "This Week with Sam Donaldson and Cokie
Roberts."
</P>
<P>
House Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt said the 1996 House
elections came down to about 10,000 voters around the country and
"if people will get out and vote, then we will have a great
outcome on Tuesday."
</P>
<P>
But Republican Representative John Kasich, on NBC's "Meet the
Press" with Gephardt, predicted that the Republican would pick up
eight to 12 seats in the House.
</P>
<P>
Republicans now maintain a 228-206 advantage in the House, with
one Democratic-leaning independent. Republicans lead in the Senate
55-45.
</P>
<P>
Senator Bob Kerrey, a Democrat, who is leading the Senate
campaign drive, said on CBS' "Face the Nation" that voter turnout
will be critical in determining whether Democrats can keep
Republicans from gaining the 60 seats needed to nullify the
minority party weapon of blocking legislation through filibusters.
</P>
<P>
Curtis Gans, director of the non-partisan Committee for the
Study of the American Electorate, said he expected a typical
midterm turnout of between 36 percent and 38 percent of eligible
voters, although voter reaction to the Monica Lewinsky affair
could have an unpredictable effect.
</P>
<P>
While voter registration is up, Gans said, voter interest is
down, with a record low 17.5 percent of eligible voters
participating in statewide primaries this year.
</P>
<P>
Civil rights leader Jesse Jackson, on CNN's "Late Edition,"
predicted that the Democrats' "basic coalition of
African-Americans, labor, Hispanics and women, that core
coalition, is going to vote in big numbers."
</P>
<P>
But on the other side, Christian Coalition Executive Director
Randy Tate foresaw a big turnout from religious conservatives. He
said conservatives, with help from 36 million election guides the
Christian Coalition sent out Sunday, "could be the deciding vote
in probably two dozen House races, and a half-dozen Senate races."
</P>
<P>
Senate Republican Campaign Committee chairman Senator Mitch
McConnell told CBS that both sides "are doing everything they can
to motivate their own people." But, he added, "frankly, we don't
know what's going to happen. We'll find out Tuesday night."
