NEW DELHI, May 22 (Xinhua) -- India Monday accused Pakistani
troops of having indulged in "wanton shelling" across the Line of
Control (LoC) in Kashmir for the past one week, which it said had
caused civilian casualties and property damage on the Indian side.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani troops had been heavily shelling Poonch, Gulmarg,
Baramullah and Kupwara sectors of India-controlled Kashmir,
hitting villages and civilian installations, the Press Trust of
India (PTI) quoted an army spokesman as saying here Monday.
</P>
<P>
In response to accusations of the Pakistani Foreign Office that
India had targeted civilians in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, the
spokesman told the PTI: "We don't target civilians." "In fact, our
villages in Kashmir are at the receiving end."
</P>
<P>
He also accused Pakistani troops of using heavy shelling as a
cover for its "mercenaries" to infiltrate into India-controlled
Kashmir, the PTI added.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Court Sentences 143 Ethnic Albanians to Prison Terms for Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 22 (Xinhua) -- A district court in the Yugoslav
province of Kosovo Monday sentenced 143 Kosovo Albanians to prison
terms ranging between seven and 13 years on terrorism charges, the
Yugoslav news media reported.
</P>
<P>
The Pechi District Court in Niss, about 200 kilometers south
of Belgrade, ruled that the group of ethnic Albanians from the
southeastern Kosovo town of Djakovica were members of the outlawed
"Kosovo Liberation Army" (KLA) and took part in terrorist attacks
on federal police during NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in April and
May last year.
</P>
<P>
Three federal policemen were killed and more than 10 wounded
in those attacks, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The Tanjug news agency quoted the judge, Goran Petronijevic,
as saying that all the convicted were proven to have joined the
KLA during the NATO bombing in April and May 1999.
</P>
<P>
Petronijevic was quoted as saying that the sentences were
based on testimonies by military and police who were called as
witnesses by the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
Through a series of strict legal procedures, 49 of the
convicted were sentenced to 13 years in prison, 51 were sentenced
to 12 years, 20 were sentenced to 10 years, 11 were sentenced to
nine years and 12 were sentenced to seven years, according to
Tanjug.

ISLAMABAD -- Afghanistan's northern alliance forces Monday
launched a major counter-offensive against the ruling Taliban
militia, the Afghan Islamic Press(AIP) reported.
</P>
<P>
The counter-offensive was aimed at recapturing the territory
they lost to the Islamic militia in the Hindukush range of
Afghanistan over the weekend, said the Pakistan-based agency.
</P>
<P>
According to initial reports, six soldiers were killed and
eight wounded from both sides.
</P>
<P>
Heavy artillery and tanks were being used by both sides in the
fierce fighting in the Salang area of Baghlan Province,said AIP.
</P>
<P>
The two factions have been fighting each other for the past
several years. After the winter's short peace, fighting erupted
again this year following the advent of summer in northern
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
AIP said the Taliban controlled the Salang-Baghlan highway
while the fighters loyal to opposition commander Ahmad Shah Masood
had occupied the heights of Hindukush overlooking the highway. (

NEW DELHI -- More than 70 Tamil rebels were killed in a face-to-
face battle with government troops who used aircraft and artillery
to repulse fresh assaults by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
(LTTE) in Sri Lanka's Jaffna peninsula, the Press Trust of India (
PTI) reported from Colombo, the Sri Lankan capital, Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan Army claimed to have successfully repulsed two
more attempts by "well-armed guerrillas" to break through the
defenses on the outskirts of Chavakachechri, a small but strategic
town which the rebels claim they captured from the army Saturday
evening, the PTI reported.
</P>
<P>
The rebels were killed in fierce fighting with the troops at
Sirasali, about five kilometers east of Chavakachechri, the PTI
quoted a Sri Lankan government spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time that the LTTE suffered such a major
loss since it launched its new offensive to recapture Jaffna on
May 10, the PTI said.
</P>
<P>
The PTI also reported from Colombo that the Sri Lankan
government Monday said it had decided to explore "diplomatic means
" to invite India to join the mediation process toward a

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Govt Urged to Assess Impact of US Garment Export Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and
Exporters Association (BGMEA) Monday urged the government to
assess the impact of a just-ratified U.S. law which will affect
the country's garment export to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Briefing reporters here, association president Anisur Rahman
Sinha said that besides drawing a strategy to face the
consequences of the law on garment exports to the United States,
the government should immediately resolve the issue over trade
union rights in the country's export processing zones (EPZs).
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton last Saturday signed the Trade and
Development Act of 2000 that opens U.S. markets to more goods from
poor African, Caribbean and Central American nations, some of whom
are Bangladesh's rivals in the garment sector.
</P>
<P>
Sinha, who has just returned home after attending a seminar in
the United States, criticized the Bangladesh mission in Washington
for "not monitoring and alerting the government about passage of
the law."
</P>
<P>
He proposed that the government send a high-level delegation to
the United States to seek duty-free access for Bangladesh products.
</P>
<P>
He said the BGMEA will be active now to help resolve the labor
union issue in the EPZs on the basis of discussions among the
government, investors, labor representatives and the U.S.
government since the settlement of the issue is important for
market access of garment products to the United States.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has been pressing Dhaka to grant the
workers in the country's EPZs the freedom of association since
June last year. However, foreign investors in the EPZs, mainly
from South Korea, China's Hong Kong, Japan and Malaysia, have
opposed the idea of introducing trade union activities in their
industrial zones, saying they had invested in the EPZs because
trade unionism was legally prohibited in those areas.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez al-Assad on
Monday held a telephone conversation with his French counterpart
Jacques Chirac on the Middle East peace process and the Israeli
pullout from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders exchanged views on the peace process and the
tense situation in south Lebanon, the Arab-Syrian News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
During the conversation, Assad reasserted his country's support
for Lebanon and its fair demands, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Chirac called for an immediate session of the international
monitoring committee, formed in 1996 by representatives of Lebanon,
Syria, Israel, the United States and France, to discuss the
escalating tension in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The situation in south Lebanon and northern Israel has become
even more tense, as the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army (SLA)
abandoned on Monday all the outposts in central security zone and
two outposts in the western sector.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of local Lebanese Shi'ite Muslims, some of them
Hezbollah activists, reportedly poured into the abandoned outposts
and nearby villages.
</P>
<P>
Israeli helicopters opened fire and killed at least two local
Lebanese civilians, apparently trying to scare them from entering
the abandoned places.
</P>
<P>
Israel invaded and occupied south Lebanon in 1978 and set up a
security zone there in 1985 with a self-claimed aim of protecting
its northern settlements from cross-border guerrilla attacks.

It is possible now that the redeployment will advance to early

<HEADLINE> Ghana Calls for Protection of Cocoa Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Ghanaian experts Monday warned that
the declining cocoa prices on world market and world trends to
substitute cocoa butter with vegetable fats in producing chocolate
might discourage farmers from growing cocoa trees.
</P>
<P>
The world market prices of cocoa have hit an all-time low in 27
years, the Ghana News Agency quoted John Henry Newman, the Chief
Executive of the Ghana Cocoa Board as saying at the opening of a
five-day regional workshop on Sustainable Tree Crops Program
(STCP) in Ghana's capital Accra on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The workshop is being attended by about 150 participants from
Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire, Nigeria, Guinea, the United States, Britain,
France and representatives of chocolate manufacturers, purchasers
and research institutions.
</P>
<P>
Newman said if the present farmers in Africa, who produce about
80 percent of the world cocoa are to be motivated to support the
cocoa industry, then they must be assured of returns for their
produce.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Edouard Koume, executive director of International
Cocoa Organization called for sustained financing of the cocoa
industry, saying without quality cocoa there would be no quality
chocolate.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Leader Urges Civilians in South Lebanon to Stay Calm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Amid mounting tensions in south
Lebanon, Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah Tuesday
afternoon urged Lebanese civilians living in the regions still
under Israeli control to stay in shelters in future days.
</P>
<P>
Civilians in Marjeyoun and Hasbaya need not be afraid of further
developments of the situation, Nasrallah was quoted as saying by
Central News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The Hezbollah leader also reiterated Lebanon's claim over the
controversial Shebaa Farms, saying Hezbollah will not cease fire if
the region still under Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah guerrillas attacked Israeli positions in Shebaa Farms
on Sunday for the first time since 1989 when the guerrillas killed
four
Israeli officers in Jabal Lus in the region.
</P>
<P>
The fertile Shebaa Farms are located on the Lebanese side of
Mount Hermon, now under Israeli occupation. Israel said the farms
belong to Syria, and that a withdrawal from the area would be
considered in its peace talks with Damascus.
</P>
<P>
According to a British-French agreement on the Lebanese-
Palestinian border in 1923, the Shebaa Farms were not included in
the Lebanon side. But Lebanon claimed that the area was bequeathed
to Beirut in an agreement between Lebanon and Syria.
</P>
<P>
At the same time he criticized U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan's report to the Security Council, which played down the
inclusion of the farms within Israel's withdrawal list.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah guerrillas and Lebanese villagers have reclaimed about
one 10th of the Israeli self-styled buffer zone in south Lebanon
within days, which could bring the 22-year Israeli occupation to a
quicker end, ahead of the deadline of July 7 set by Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Official Briefs Mubarak on Peace Talks With Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Public Security Minister
Shlomo Ben-Ami met Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak here on Tuesday
and briefed him on the Stockholm peace talks between Israel and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"There are still fundamental differences between the Israeli and
Palestinian positions, and we need to create an appropriate
atmosphere so our leaders can meet at the end of June in the United
States to take difficult decisions at the right moment," Ben-Ami
told reporters after talks with Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
"Mubarak is a conciliator in the peace process, and we feel he
is ready to keep playing that role," said Ben-Ami, who is leading
the Israeli delegation at the peace talks launched recently in
Sweden with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami said upon arrival in Cairo Monday night that Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak "saw the need to inform President Mubarak
and the Egyptian government about this moment in the peace
process."
</P>
<P>
The region has also been hit by a wave of deadly Israeli-
Palestinian violence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip over the past
week.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami also said he discussed with Mubarak the overnight
pullout of hundreds of Israeli soldiers from the zone it has
occupied for about two decades in south Lebanon, but gave no
details.
</P>
<P>
Barak recalled Ben-Ami and negotiator Gilad Sher from Stockholm
on Monday because of the surge of violence in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip over the past week.
</P>
<P>
However, reports said the talks were expected to resume this
week.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians have been holding back-door talks in
the Swedish capital in a bid to forge a framework for a final peace
deal after decades of conflict.
</P>
<P>
The existence of the parallel channel was revealed on May 14,
the day just after the two sides missed the second deadline for the
framework deal, and the current round of the talks started last
Thursday.

deliberations on the U.N. Security Council Resolution 1284, which
is aimed at resuming the arms inspections on Iraq suspended since
December 1998 when the U.S. and Britain launched the four-night air
strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Aziz reiterated Iraq's rejection of the U.N.
resolution approved last December, claiming that it will neither
provide a solution to the Iraqi issue, nor lead to the lifting of
the U.N. sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Terming Russia as a friendly country, Aziz appreciated the stand
of Russia which has been calling for the lifting of the sanctions
on Iraq, the INA said.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Khorotzeiv said Russia is willing to develop
relations with Iraq and will continue to make efforts to put an end
to the sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Russia, a close ally and important trading partner of Iraq, has
been vying for a larger market share of Iraq under the U.N. oil-
for-food program, launched in the late 1996 to alleviate the
sufferings of the Iraqi people who have been under crippling
sanctions since Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Russian officials recently visited Baghdad and expressed
readiness to provide Iraq with spare parts, equipment and
machinery, of which Iraq is in dire need for its dilapidated
industries.

<HEADLINE> 1,000 SLA Militiamen Surrender to Lebanese Army </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Some 1,000 South Lebanon Army (SLA)
militiamen have surrendered to Lebanese army, Hezbollah guerrillas
or Amal Movement since the beginning of May, the local radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
About 800 militiamen surrendered this week when the Israeli-
allied militia collapsed with Israel's withdrawal from south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Since Israel began its withdrawal from south Lebanon earlier
this month, dozens of SLA militiamen have deserted, many of whom
surrendered to the resistance guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
As Israel promised to pull out all its forces from south Lebanon
by July, the fate of the SLA militiamen has drawn more and more
world attention. Both the Lebanese government troops and Hezbollah
have announced that they will not forgive the militiamen who
betrayed their country and will bring them to trial.
</P>
<P>
The SLA, funded and trained by Israel, helps the Jewish state
patrol its self-proclaimed security zone it carved out in south
Lebanon in 1985. The militia has 3,000 members, 70 percent of whom
are Shiite Muslims.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wants Orderly Takeover of Southern Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Tuesday that it wanted Lebanese army to take over southern Lebanon
in an orderly way after Israel pulls its troops back from the
occupied area.
</P>
<P>
"The Lebanese people have wanted to be in charge of their
country. This is their opportunity and to have the Lebanese army
be able to do it in an orderly way would be good," Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Albright made the remarks following her telephone conversations
with leaders and officials in the region and in other interested
countries, including Syria, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and France.
</P>
<P>
"We've been urging restraint and its important for the
international community to help throughout this whole process and
to make sure that the withdrawal is done in as orderly way as
possible," she said.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Washington had been
concerned over violence that erupted as Israeli troops started
moving out of the area.
</P>
<P>
"I think we've expressed some concern over the last two days,
but this is a situation that's in progress. And I think the U.N.
has an important mission ahead of it, and we plan to support that,
" Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council has endorsed a plan put forward by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to verify the Israeli withdrawal and
helping Lebanon restore its authority in the region, which will
involve beefing up the U.N. force there.

<HEADLINE> UK's House Prices Near Top, Says Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 23 (Xinhua) - Britain's housing market has reached
a peak and will fall sharply next year, a leading group of
forecasters has warned.
</P>
<P>
Across Britain, price rises will be 12 percent this year before
falling back to 5 percent in the following year, according to a
new report by Cambridge Econometrics.
</P>
<P>
House prices in the capital are now higher in relation to
incomes than at any time since 1988, with Londoners having to pay
the equivalent of 4.78 times average incomes to secure a home,
against a ratio of 3.03 percent five years ago.
</P>
<P>
The ripple effect from London has pushed prices up throughout
the South East, taking the house price to income ratio from 2.82
percent five years ago to 3.94 percent.
</P>
<P>
The picture in the North and Midlands is mixed, with some
regions enjoying modest growth but others seeing slowdowns, to
less than 3 percent in the case of northern England.
</P>
<P>
The report said several factors would halt the boom market. "
Levels of lending are expected to fall, interest rates are
expected to increase further and the exceptionally high growth in
prices in recently years has made property much less affordable."
</P>
<P>
Cambridge Econometrics expects housing activity to slow fastest
in London and the South East.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Zambia Launches National Program to End Child Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Zambia on Tuesday launched a
National Program on Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labors
to combat the worsening child labor problem in the country.
</P>
<P>
The move places the southern African country into a network of
some 60 nations around the world, which have committed themselves
to the lofty cause of the International Program on the Elimination
of Child Labor (IPEC).
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the number of child labors has kept surging
both in Zambia and Africa due to the deepening poverty in the
continent.
</P>
<P>
According to an estimate of the International Labor
Organization (ILO), an IPEC co-sponsor, about 80 million children
between the ages of five and 14 are working in Africa, out of a
total of some 250 million in the world.
</P>
<P>
In Zambia, a government sponsored survey in 1999 showed that
the total number of full-time and part-time child labor aged
between five to 17 amounts to 563,044. This is indeed a alarming
figure in a country with a population of about 10 million.
</P>
<P>
The grave child labor problem compounds the already severe
school dropping-out situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that about 40 percent of the working kids have
never attended school and most of the rest have had only limited
schooling. The statistics further indicate that, in the age group
between 5 and 9, about 55.3 percent have never attended school at
all.
</P>
<P>
The child labors in Zambia are involved in a wide span of
employment from domestic chores to prostitution. But fortunately,
Zambia has been spared from the evil of child soldiers, which were
commonplace among some of the country's neighbors.
</P>
<P>
To tackle the problems, Zambia has been active in netting in
international help.
</P>
<P>
Zambia have long ratified both the United Nations Convention on
Child Labor Article 32 and the ILO Minimum Age for Admission to
Employment Convention No. 138 of 1973, and is to ratify the new
Worst Forms of Child Labor Convention adopted on the ILO
International Labor Conference last June.
</P>
<P>
Under the latest Convention, the rectifying nations must take
measures to prohibit and immediately eliminate the worst forms of
child labor, and arrange for the child labors' rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
To this end, Zambian government and the ILO have signed a
memorandum on cooperation. The United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF) has also pledged an amount of 175,000 U.S. dollars and
the ILO some 300,000 dollars to fund the country's drive.
</P>
<P>
With the help, Zambia plans to implement, starting from July
this year a program to prevent, remove and rehabilitate children
from hazardous work in commercial agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Under the just launched national program, Zambia will target
over 1,400 child labors countrywide in its first two years to
provide them the access to education, training, counselling,
health services and recreational activities.
</P>
<P>
Addressing Tuesday's launching ceremony of the program,
Zambia's Minister of Education Godfrey Miyanda said that a step
by step approach will be adopted in the country's combat against
child labor.
</P>
<P>
The government will do whatever possible to withdraw children
from exploitative and hazardous work, and provide them and their
families with viable alternatives. For those who still have to
remain in working, the government will make efforts to improve
their working conditions, which will serve as a transitional step
toward the elimination of child labor, said the minister.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Punish Parents of School Droop-outs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria will punish the parents who
prevent their children from attending schools under the new
Universal Basic Education Program (UBE).
</P>
<P>
The UBE Coordinator, Pai Obanya Tuesday said in the country's
capital Abuja that the move was aimed at obligating parents,
guardians and communities to free the children to take full
advantage of the opportunities offered by the program, according
to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
He noted that most parents had cited in the past the high cost
of education the reason for not sending their children to schools.
</P>
<P>
But he said the UBE program, aimed at providing "universal,
free and compulsory" education to all school-age kids, would be
funded mainly through governmental budgetary provisions.
</P>
<P>
This meant poverty would no longer be an obstacle to any child
or adolescent intending to receive basic education, he said.

<HEADLINE> Second Euro-Med Parliamentary Conference Opens in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The Euro-Mediterranean countries
kicked off on Tuesday their second parliamentary conference in the
Egyptian Mediterranean port city of Alexandria to discuss regional
peace and stability and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said in a keynote speech that a
comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East is a key
element for the security and stability in the Mediterranean region
and to guide the European march of cooperation with Mediterranean
countries.
</P>
<P>
In the speech read by Speaker of the Egyptian People's Assembly
Fathi Sorour, Mubarak said the Mideast peace process must be based
on the land-for-peace principle and the relevant international
resolutions, which are aimed at securing equal rights for all
nations in the region.
</P>
<P>
He called on the European Union (EU) and Mediterranean countries
to exert joint efforts to help push forward the peace talks between
Arab countries and Israel.
</P>
<P>
"It is important for European and Mediterranean states to seek
to declare the Middle East and the Mediterranean areas free of
weapons of mass destruction," Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
This will provide a key step to curb arms race in the two
regions and the dangers that arms race will bring to the security
of Europe and the Mediterranean, he added.
</P>
<P>
The 15 EU member states and 12 Mediterranean countries decided
in 1995 during a meeting in Barcelona, Spain, to start a process
aimed at forging close cooperation in the political, economic,
social and security fields.
</P>
<P>
The Euro-Med cooperation march is facing many challenges that
need to be addressed before a mature relationship is attained to
fulfill the aspirations of the people in the region for mutual
development, prosperity and peace based on rights and justice that
all the Euro-Med countries will enjoy, Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
He, in the meantime, called for close cooperation among the
Euro-Med countries in fighting against terrorism, organized crime
and drug trafficking, which endanger the countries' security and
stability.
</P>
<P>
What the parliamentary conference must take into account is
national political stability which is essential for economic
cooperation and development and for attraction of investments to
the Mediterranean countries, the Egyptian leader said.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak maintained that economic cooperation and growth, in
turn, will enhance political stability. "This requires the
translation of the Barcelona Declaration principles to specific
programs and projects aimed at promoting sustained growth," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The two-day Euro-Med parliamentary conference will focus on
discussion of issues related to economic cooperation, regional
security and cultural exchange.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Judiciary Orders Closure of Reformist Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Iran's conservative judiciary has
ordered a reformist Persian daily to stop publication after
publishing only one issue, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the Domestic Media Department of the Ministry of
Culture and Islamic Guidance, Tehran's Justice Department ordered
the paper to stop publication until further notice, according to
Saeed Haqi, publisher of the daily Mellat (the Nation).
</P>
<P>
The first issue of the paper only hit stands on Monday. Haqi
said ahead of the publication that the paper aimed to reflect the
voice of the "silent majority."
</P>
<P>
Iran's conservative judiciary had ordered the closure of 17
reformist papers and journals in April for so-called reasons of
violating Islamic principles and advocating American-style reforms.
</P>
<P>
The measure was part of a stepped-up conservative effort to
crack down on the country's reformist campaign fostered by
President Mohammad Khatami since he took office in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Khatami's reformist allies won an overwhelming victory in the
parliamentary election in February, ending the long-time
conservative control of the legislative body.
</P>
<P>
The result, however, annoyed the conservative hardliners, who
have since taken tough measures to undermine the reformist
influence and strengthen their control of the Islamic regime.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Asks Syria Not to Make Provocation During Israel Pullout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 23 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
Tuesday urged Syria not to make any provocation during the on-
going Israeli pullout from southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In a statement made in Standarder, Spain, where he was
attending a French-Spanish summit meeting, Chirac said that each
side in southern Lebanon should now remain calm and cool-minded.
</P>
<P>
"Syria should understand that it is in its interest to do
nothing which can be interpreted as a provocation," Agence France-
presse quoted Chirac as saying.
</P>
<P>
Syria has 35,000 troops permanently deployed in Lebanon and
supports the Shiite guerrilla group Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that the Lebanese government should have the full
capacity to deploy necessary means in and take over the territory
liberated from Israeli occupation, as well as to run its border.
</P>
<P>
He also called on Israel to "respect letter by letter the
demand made by the United Nations Security Council in Resolution
425, which called on Israeli to withdraw from southern Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
As for a United Nations plan to deploy its peacekeeping force
in southern Lebanon, Chirac said that will examine "in a very open
and comprehensive way" any demand to be made by the U.N. for a
French participation in such a mission.
</P>
<P>
"All that goes in the direction of peace in the Middle East
wins the support of the French government," he said.
</P>
<P>
France has 250 soldiers serving in the United Nations Interim
Force in Lebanon (UNIFL), which has been deployed since 1978 after
an invasion by Israel into Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan has suggested a reinforcement
of the UNIFL from 4,500 men to 7,935 and to redeploy it in the
former Israeli-imposed security zone.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian-Moroccan Trade Summit Sees Six Accords Signed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
Moroccan King Mohammed VI held trade talks here Tuesday on the
sidelines of a meeting of the two countries' joint higher
committee, during which six agreements were signed.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa told reporters that the two
leaders discussed "ways of dealing with some basic shortcomings
regarding the balance of trade."
</P>
<P>
Since Egypt and Morocco formed the joint higher committee, their
trade volume has risen by 85 percent to 37 million U.S. dollars in
1999 from 20 million dollars in 1996. The two countries hope to
enhance the volume to an annual 100 million dollars in light of the
free trade agreement signed in April, 1999. They have a vision to
raise the trade volume to 1 billion dollars in 2010.
</P>
<P>
One of the six cooperation agreements signed Tuesday committed
the two countries to expand the list of tariff-free goods exchanged
within the framework of the free trade agreement, Egypt's Minister
of Economy and Foreign Trade Youssef Boutros Ghali told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Other accords were on cooperation in the fields of housing,
environment, quality specifications and the sea ports of Alexandria
in Egypt and Casablanca in Morocco.

<P>
The two leaders also discussed Arab cooperation and solidarity
in political and economic spheres, Moussa said.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The approval of Jerusalem municipality
to build a Jewish settlement in Abu Dis, an Arab village near
Jerusalem, is a fatal blow to the Palestinian-Israeli peace
process, a top Palestinian official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The continuation of Israeli settlement activities will
undermine the peace process that is needed for more efforts
to push it forward, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's adviser
Nabil Abu Rdainah told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He asked the Israeli government to stop all settlement
activities and land confiscation and show more seriousness in the
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian chief negotiator in the interim talks
Saeb Erekat condemned the Israeli move and deemed it a fatal blow
to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Erekat told the Egyptian "Voice of Arabs" radio that the
possibility to reach a Palestinian-Israeli framework agreement on
the final status in time depended on Israeli political decisions.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government move, aimed to please the Jewish
extremists, is an illusion and making light of the peace process,
he pointed out.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Israeli Withdrawal from S. Lebanon Receives Mixed Reactions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Israel's withdrawal from south
Lebanon early Tuesday sparked mixed reactions in the country with
the government defending its decision and the opposition accusing
it of stirring up chaos inside the security zone.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ehud Barak said earlier Tuesday the withdrawal
from south Lebanon is a right decision that the government has
made.
</P>
<P>
The government did the right thing in deciding to bring the
Israeli troops back from south Lebanon, Barak said, adding that by
implementing the United Nations Security Council Resolution 425,
Israel will receive extensive international backing.
</P>
<P>
This will make it possible to raise the level of Israeli
reaction if there are any Hezbollah guerrillas attack against
Israel after Israel's withdrawal, Barak said.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Likud party, which strongly urged the government
to pull out the Israeli troops from south Lebanon in the past, now
sounded a different tone by accusing the Barak government of
bringing about chaos to the security zone.
</P>
<P>
Some of the Likud key members, including Silvan Shalon and Moshe
Arens, urged the government to delay the pullback.
</P>
<P>
They also called on Barak to take tough military actions against
Hezbollah and Lebanese targets before making further withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
President Ezer Weizman said the pullout is a very difficult
decision that the government has made and urged all the Israeli
political parties and people to support it.
</P>
<P>
Weizman said the quickly changing situation in south Lebanon is
within expectation and there is no need for the northern residents
to be panic.
</P>
<P>
B'tselem, the Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the
Occupied Territories, welcomed the Israeli pullout from south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The peace group said in a statement that "this comes out after
many years of occupation which resulted in severe human rights
violations against Lebanese civilians."
</P>
<P>
But it urged Barak not to make "harsher response" in case of
possible military attacks against Israel after the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Israel evacuated the Bint Jubeil outpost in the security zone
earlier Tuesday and 120 Israeli soldiers returned to Israel along
with their equipment, marking the beginning of the large-scale
withdrawal from the security zone, which Israel set up in 1985 with
a self-proclaimed purpose of protecting its northern security.

<HEADLINE> Arabs Demand Israel's Full Withdrawal from Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League on Tuesday demanded
Israel's full withdrawal from south Lebanon after the overnight
retreat of what security sources said was three quarters of its
troops in the region.
</P>
<P>
"Serious intentions are required to achieve peace in the
region," Muhab Muqbil, the league's assistant secretary general for
media affairs, told reporters at the Cairo-based 22-nation pan-Arab
organization.
</P>
<P>
"But we're still waiting for the first indications from Israel
of such intentions, especially considering the current unreassuring
situation, with Israel continuing its tyrannical shelling of areas
in south Lebanon," Muqbil said.
</P>
<P>
Several hundred Israeli soldiers pulled out of south Lebanon
overnight after their allied militia, the South Lebanon Army (SLA),
collapsed in the face of advances by Shiite Muslim guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, five Lebanese civilians were reportedly killed and
more than 30 wounded as Israeli forces artillery and warplanes
tried to prevent former residents, accompanied by guerrillas, from
returning to their villages.
</P>
<P>
Muqbil said the continuation of Israeli attacks on Lebanon
will "only serve to escalate the brave and heroic Lebanese
resistance" and he called on the international community to "
intervene immediately to force Israel to halt the aggression."
</P>
<P>
The strategic goal of the Arab states is to achieve a just and
lasting peace in the region, said the official.
</P>
<P>
"But the withdrawal will not be complete until Israel has
withdrawn unconditionally from all occupied Arab lands including
the Golan Heights, the West Bank, Jerusalem and south Lebanon,"
Muqbil said when asked about Israel's partial withdrawal Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied the Golan Heights from Syria, the West Bank and
East Jerusalem in the 1967 Arab-Israeli War. The Jewish state has
yet to resume peace talks with Syria on the return of the strategic
plateau. Its negotiations with the Palestinians for a final peace
agreement on the thorniest issues, including the fate of Jerusalem,
have made little progress.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian-Moroccan Trade Summit Sees Six Accords Signed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
Moroccan King Mohammed VI held trade talks here Tuesday on the
sidelines of a meeting of the two countries' joint higher
committee, during which six agreements were signed.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa told reporters that the two
leaders discussed "ways of dealing with some basic shortcomings
regarding the balance of trade."
</P>
<P>
Since Egypt and Morocco formed the joint higher committee, their
trade volume has risen by 85 percent to 37 million U.S. dollars in
1999 from 20 million dollars in 1996. The two countries hope to
heighten the volume to an annual average of 100 million dollars in
light of the free trade agreement signed in April, 1999. They have
a vision to raise the trade volume to one billion dollars in 2010.
</P>
<P>
One of the six cooperation agreements signed Tuesday commits the
two countries to expand the list of tariff-free goods exchanged
within the framework of the free trade agreement, Egypt's Minister
of Economy and Foreign Trade Youssef Boutros Ghali told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The rest five agreements cover bilateral cooperation in housing,
environment, quality specifications and other fields.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also discussed Arab cooperation and solidarity
in political and economic spheres, Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and Mohammed VI, who arrived in Cairo Monday evening for
a three-day visit, were co-chairing the Egyptian-Moroccan joint
higher committee devoted to upping their trade and promoting the
free trade zone.
</P>
<P>
The Moroccan monarch visited Egypt in April to attend the first
Africa-Europe summit.

<HEADLINE> AL Chief Calls For Lifting of Sanctions on Iraq: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) Secretary
General Ahmed Esmat Abdel-Meguid has called for the lifting of the
sanctions imposed on Iraq since 1990 to alleviate the plight of the
Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
According to a report received here on Tuesday, the AL chief
said that it is unacceptable for the decade-long U.N. sanctions to
continue indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
However, He urged Iraq to cooperate with the U.N as a gateway to
the lifting of the sanctions, the report said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed deep concern over the sufferings of the Iraqi
people and called for a united Arabic position to ease Iraq's
humanitarian crisis as a direct result of the crippling sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq claims that nearly 1.3 million people, mostly children and
the elderly, have died of curable diseases due to the "genocidal"
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
AL "totally rejects" the almost-daily aggressions made by the U.
S. and British warplanes over northern and southern Iraq, he said,
adding that these aggressions have no legitimacy and represent a
violation of Iraqi airspace.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's sovereignty and territorial integrity must be respected,
said Abdel-Meguid.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has repeatedly protested to the AL and the U.N. over the U.
S.and British aggressions on Iraq, demanding their intervention to
pressure the U.S. and Britain to stop such aggressive acts.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and British planes have been enforcing the two no-fly zones
in northern and southern Iraq, set up after the 1991 Gulf War, and
bombing targets inside the air exclusion zones.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has never recognized the zones, which are not authorized by
any U.N. resolution.

<HEADLINE> EU Survey Finds Excessive Bank Fees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 23 (Xinhua) -- People transferring money from one
euro zone country to another are paying much more than they do
within one country, a study has found.
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted by a consumer institute for the European
Commission and published Tuesday, found that sending 100 euro (91
U.S. dollars) from one euro zone country to another costs on
average a bank fee of 17 euro (15.4 dollars).
</P>
<P>
A domestic transfer of the same amount costs less than 1 euro (
0.91 dollars).
</P>
<P>
David Byrne, EU commissioner for consumer protection, described
the finding of the study as "disturbing."
</P>
<P>
"The results of this survey are disturbing, particularly in
terms of widespread double charging," said the commissioner
together with Frits Bolkestein, EU commissioner for internal
market.
</P>
<P>
The two commissioners, however, said that there was little the
European Union can do in that it has been left to the market to
find rates at which banks charge their fees for money transfers.
</P>
<P>
The survey was carried out in the 11 EU member states that have
joined the single currency mechanism on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The 11 countries have linked their currencies to a value of the
euro that will have become the common tender by 2002. By doing so,
these countries have removed all exchange rate fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
During the survey, four investigators in each euro nation made
eight transfers to two other euro zone countries and they also
received eight transfers from a euro nation. All transfers were of
the amount of 100 euro.
</P>
<P>
The survey found out that the costliest transfer fee was that
from Italy to Austria, costing 46.76 euro (42.55 dollars) and the
cheapest transfer fee was that from Luxembourg to France, costing
1.98 euro (1.8 dollars).

<HEADLINE> Security Council Backs Annan's Intention to Reinforce U.N. Mission in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council Tuesday voiced its strong support for the intention of U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to reinforce the U.N. mission in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The move came after the Security Council held consultations
Tuesday morning on Annan's report on Lebanon in which the U.N.
chief recommended that the total troop strength of the United
Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) for carrying out the
tasks related to confirming the withdrawal of Israeli troops from
southern Lebanon be increased from the present level of 4,513 to
approximately 5,600.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief also recommended that once the Israeli
withdrawal is confirmed and if the security situation permits, the
force of the UNIFIL be immediately increased to 7,935 personnel.
</P>
<P>
In a presidential statement, the Security Council welcomed the
U.N. chief to take all necessary measures to enable the UNIFIL to
confirm whether a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from
Lebanon has taken place in compliance with U.N. Resolution 425 of
1978, and to take all necessary steps in order to deal with
possible eventualities.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council fully endorsed the list of requirements put
forward by the Secretary-General for confirming Israeli withdrawal
from southern Lebanon in compliance with Resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council welcomed the decision by the Secretary-
General to send his Special Envoy back to the region immediately
to ensure that the requirements put forward by the Secretary-
General are met and ensure the commitments of all parties to
cooperate fully with the United Nations in the complete
implementation of its resolutions 425 and 426 of 1978.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council called upon the States and other parties
concerned to exercise utmost restraint and to cooperate with the
UNIFIL and the United Nations to ensure a full implementation of
its resolutions 425 and 426.
</P>
<P>
The Council took this opportunity to express its appreciation
and its full support for the continuing efforts of the Secretary-
General, his Special Envoy to the region and his staff.
</P>
<P>
Israel informed the United Nations in April that it would
withdrawal all its troops from southern Lebanon by July. The
withdrawal began early this month. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak has ordered their withdrawal hastened in the face of
advancing Hizbollah guerrillas.

<HEADLINE> Greece Hopes for Turkish Initiatives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Greece hopes that Turkey will
undertake initiatives to reach settlements that will consolidate
even more the cooperation in the region.
</P>
<P>
"Athens hopes for initiatives by Turkey, so we can proceed to
adjustments that solidly consolidate regional cooperation," Greek
Prime Minister Costas Simitis said after meeting with President
Costis Stephanopoulos Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Greece's Foreign Minister George Papandreou said in
an interview with BBB radio Tuesday that the relations between
Greece and Turkey had entered a new phase. "A phase wherein we
proceed to the enforcement of the mutual decisions which have been
documented in nine agreements, " he added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the next step in the relations between the
two neighboring countries would be the development of the
Confidence-Building Measures (CBMs) and possibly other measures
that would ease tensions in bilateral relations and would promote
good neighborliness.
</P>
<P>
As for the Cyprus problem, Papandreou described the issue as
an international one, but he expressed the hope that they would
soon reach their resolution.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, have nearly gone to war
three times in the past 26 years because of their territorial
disputes in the Aegean Sea and the Cyprus problem, but the two
long-time rivals have since last June taken actions to improve
their strained relations with the holding of several rounds of low-
level talks and the signing of a number of bilateral cooperation
pacts.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, a total of 12 Turkish F-16s jet fighters were for
the first time allowed to landed at a central Greek Air Force base
since 1974, and the Turkish fighters, along with Greek fighters,
are now participating in a major NATO military exercise, which
began on May 20 and will end on June 10.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Tuesday called upon Ethiopia and Eritrea to agreed to "an
immediate cease-fire" and resume the peace talks in a bid to
restore peace at an early date in the Horn of Africa region.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read to the press, the president of the
Security Council, Wang Yingfan of China, said that "we urge both
parties, Ethiopia and Eritrea, to agree to an immediate cease-fire
" in accordance with relevant U.N. resolutions, adopted since the
May 12 outbreak of the fighting between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"The Council members agreed on the need to reconvene the
proximate talks as soon as possible under the OAU (Organization of
African Unity) auspices," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, in a statement issued by
his spokesman here Monday, called for an immediate cease-fire
between the two neighboring countries, saying that he was "
immediately saddened" at the resumption of the "increasingly
incomprehensible" war.
</P>
<P>
"There can be no justification for such large-scale death and
suffering, especially at a time when both countries are wracked by
drought and hunger," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that Ethiopia and Eritrea had already
agreed to settle their conflict through restoring the status quo
as of May 6, 1998 and through the delimitation and demarcation of
their border with U.N. help, and that they had already agreed on
the sequence of mutual withdrawal from occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
"That is why the Secretary-General has repeatedly stressed
that the differences between the two countries cannot justify in
any way the great loss in human lives they already suffered and
stand to suffer further," the spokesman said. "History will not
easily understand or forgive if there is any further killing and
unnecessary humanitarian suffering."
</P>
<P>
Annan expressed his full support for the current mission of
Ahmed Ouyahia, the special envoy of Organization of African Unity
Chairman and Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika and for the
efforts of other peace envoys, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the governments of Ethiopia and Eritrea to seize this
opportunity and "give peace a chance," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Some 20,000 Eritrean refugees had fled into Sudan since the
middle of last week, crossing four entry points as Ethiopian
forces pushed into Eritrea, said the U.N. High Commission for
Refugees (UNHCR). The agency also said that its staff in the
Eritrean capital of Asmara were trying to gain access to more than
500,000 people displaced by the Ethiopian offensive.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia and Eritrea renewed their border war on May 12 after
a year's lull and the breakdown of peace talks in Algeria under
the OAU auspices.

<HEADLINE> France Urges Israel to Avoid Provocative Acts Over Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 23 (Xinhua) -- France called on Israel Tuesday to
avoid making any action of provocation which could aggravate the
situation in southern Lebanon, as the Jewish state is accelerating
its pullout from there.
</P>
<P>
"France calls on all sides to exercise the biggest restraint
and demand that the Israeli pullout be done in good order while
security for civilians is guaranteed," said French Foreign
Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that Israel restrains from any action in the nature of
provocation which can aggravate the situation," she said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli troops are pulling out of southern Lebanon after
occupying it for 22 years, leaving behind a vacuum of power and
leaving the United Nations totally unprepared.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman said that France is studying the new situation
resulting from an accelerated pullout of Israel, but nothing has
been decided yet on a United Nations peacekeeping operation in
southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
She said that in the first step, the United Nations should "
certify" the withdrawal of Israel, which she said should be "total
" and should go beyond an operational line around a frontier drawn
in 1923 between France and Britain, two powers which controlled
Lebanon and Palestine at that time.
</P>
<P>
France has asked United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan to
send his envoy for the Middle East, Norwegian diplomat Terje Rod
Larsen, to Israel, Lebanon and Syria this week to talk to the
leaders of these countries on the new situation in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"We don't want vague commitment.... We want Mr. Rod Larsen to
obtain a certain number of guarantees in terms of security for the
follow-up period," said the spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
France also wants a total disarmament of the Israeli-backed
South Lebanon Army, a self-defense force consisting of Christians
and Druses operating as a proxy army for Israel since 1978, she
said.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman said that the attitude of the Hezbollah
guerrillas will be a major factor in evaluating the situation when
the U.N. decides whether to launch a peacekeeping mission in
southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"All options are possible. We should not forget that the U.N.
Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFL) is an intermediary force in
charge of helping the Lebanese government ensure the restoration
of its efficient authority in the region of southern Lebanon,"
said the spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Secretary General has suggested a reinforcement of the
UNIFL from 4,500 men to 7,935 and redeploy it in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
France has 250 soldiers participating in the UNIFL.

<HEADLINE> Canada Pays Record Legal Fees to Win Tobacco Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Canada has spent a record 3.76
million Canadian dollars (about 2.51 million U.S. dollars) in a
bid to win a tobacco lawsuit of 1 billion U.S. dollars in New York
State.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian government may have to pay millions more to
Chicago law firm Bartlit Beck Herman in legal expenses against the
RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company since it launched the unprecedented
civil fraud suit last December, the Ottawa Citizen newspaper said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Citing Canada's Department of Justice information, the
newspaper said the fees are the highest legal tab ever run up by
the federal government in a single fiscal year and there is no end
in sight.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian government is accusing RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company,
five related companies and the Canadian Tobacco Manufacturers
Council of aiding and abetting the smuggling of tobacco products
from the U.S.
</P>
<P>
The government claims it was defrauded of more than 1 billion U.
S. dollars in foregone taxes, duties and other costs from 1991 to
1994.
</P>
<P>
If the Canadian government wins its civil case in U.S. District
Court, it would be awarded 3 billion U.S. dollars, which triple
the amount of proven damages.
</P>
<P>
Both the plaintiff and the defendant have already hired a
phalanx of top-flight U.S. lawyers to fight a tough and, probably,
lengthy legal battle.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department is also dedicating a five-lawyer, in-
house team to the tobacco smuggling litigation, said the newspaper.

<P>
OTTAWA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian Defense Department is
launching a 12-page survey, asking the country's 2,500 women
soldiers what their requirements will be for a combat bra.
</P>
<P>
The department confirmed to local media Monday that about half
the women soldiers filled out the survey mailed in February, an
unusually high response rate.
</P>
<P>
The survey will be used to determine how military women feel

Canadian dollars (about 123 million U.S. dollars) to update
clothing and gear used by the 60,000-strong Canadian forces.
</P>
<P>
The Clothe the Soldier section of the department is upgrating
24 pieces of clothing and gear, mostly designed decades ago.
</P>
<P>
The survey about developing the world's first combat bra is
expected to last several more weeks.

new ways of managing its water resources to avoid being affected
by floods and droughts, Rural Resources and Water Development
Deputy Minister Cain Mathema said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mathema, who was launching the Zimbabwe National Water
Partnership in Harare, said that water resources management was
the only solution to floods and droughts which were common in
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
He said floods which lashed the country recently destroyed the
gains made in rural sanitation and left many people exposed to
water-related diseases.
</P>
<P>
Despite the many projects that have been undertaken to manage
water resources, he said, there had not been effective mechanism
to coordinate the activities at the national level.
</P>
<P>
The unavailability of information on water, he said, was the
reason that strongly affected the effective and sustainable
management of water resources.
</P>
<P>
"Yet the experiences of one country or community might hold
valuable and applicable knowledge for other areas," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said unless such information was shared, Zimbabwe faced the
problem of failing to effectively manage its water resources.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the launching of the partnership would provide a
forum for the exchange of ideas and experiences in water
resources management.
</P>
<P>
He appealed for the active participation of the private sector
in water resources management.
</P>
<P>
"It is only through networking that we shall be able to obtain
 information that is not sufficiently available," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe National Water Partnership would be responsible
for establishing the principles of sustainable water resources
management.

<HEADLINE> Burundian Government to Meet Rebels in July: Mandela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The Burundian rebel leaders
and government officials are expected to finally meet face to face
in July, chief mediator Nelson Mandela said in Johannesburg on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Commendable" progress had been made toward solving the
seven-year-old civil war in Burundi, Mandela told reporters at his
Houghton home.
</P>
<P>
The exact date for the next round of negotiations had not been
set, Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
"A number of Heads of State said they are keen to come," he
said. "But I will not say who".
</P>
<P>
At the next round of talks, expected to be held in Arusha,
Tanzania, the parties were expected to comment and make
recommendations regarding the draft proposal drawn up at previous
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said although a meeting had been scheduled for June, it
had been postponed because of the late entry into negotiations by
two of the major rebel factions.
</P>
<P>
He said the two groups had appealed for more time to study the
draft proposals.
</P>
<P>
Under a power-sharing agreement envisaged by Mandela, the Hutu
rebels would be integrated into the army and free elections for
parliament and the presidency be held after the period of
transition.
</P>
<P>
On Monday and Tuesday Mandela held discussions with
representatives from the various warring parties at his home.
</P>
<P>
These included: the Forces for the Defence of Democracy, the
National Liberation Front, the National Council for the Defence of
Democracy, the Party for the Liberation of the Hutu People and the
Front for National Liberation as well as representatives of the
Burundian government.
</P>
<P>
Mandela refused to disclose details of the discussions, saying
he did not want to jeopardize the process. However, he said he
had sought the assurances from each of the parties that they would
accept the final proposals, once they were drafted.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone must accept the final proposals," the former South
African president said.
</P>
<P>
He said he mentioned this to the leaders confidentially and had
told them that some of their recommendations regarding the draft
agreement would be accepted and others rejected.
</P>
<P>
They unanimously agreed to accept the final agreement, said
Mandela, but he warned there would be no going back once the final
agreement was in place.
</P>
<P>
Mandela took over as chief mediator of the Burundi conflict
after the death of former Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere.
</P>
<P>
Civil war broke out in Burundi in 1993 when Tutsi paratroopers
assassinated the country's first democratically elected president
Melchior Ndadye. The war has so far claimed more than 200,000
lives.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Organization Cautions Danger of Toxic Waste Landfill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 23 (Xinhua) -- A Mozambican environmental
organization Tuesday warned that the government's approach to
burry toxic waste in one of its selected landfill sites may still
pose threats to the environment.
</P>
<P>
Mauricio Sulila, secretary-general of the "Livaningo", a non-
governmental organization in the country said his organization was
to carry out a study to assess the feasibility of the method after
the finial site had been chosen by the government.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican Environment Ministry announced on Monday that it
intended to bury, in one place among Boane, Boquico or Beluluane
in the country's southern Maputo Province, part of the about 850
tons of obsolete pesticides.
</P>
<P>
Livaningo had in the past vetoed the government's decision to
incinerate the pesticides, saying that the pesticides contain
heavy metals, therefore too dangerous to be incinerated.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Government Refuses to Deal With Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Defense Minister Kundi
Paihama has reiterated Angolan government's position that it will
not make a deal with the rebel leader Jonas Savimbi, accusing him
of going back on his previous commitment.
</P>
<P>
Paihama told officials attending the meeting of defense
ministers of the Community of the Portuguese-speaking Countries
(CPLP), which was underway in Luanda, that the government will
maintain the position, despite different voices from some national
and international groups.
</P>
<P>
The 1991 Bicesse (Portugal) and 1994 Lusaka accords were not
respected by Jonas Savimbi, leader of the rebel National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), who "chose war as the
only way to subvert the democratic order in the country", said
Paihama.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, it was "imperative" for the
international community to join the Angolan government's efforts
to isolate Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
He said that after the "Restauro Operation" which ended last
January, the government troops had been pursuing the rebels all
around the country, while the rebels had scattered into small
groups and hidden in some forest areas.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Pledges to Ensure Drug-Free Certification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's National Drugs Law
Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) will ensure that Nigeria is certified
drugs free after the scheduled assessment in November this year,
the agency's Chairman Iliya Lokadang said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing his maiden press conference since assuming office on
May 4, Lokadang said that the NDLEA was working very hard toward
achieving certification, adding that the goal will be met with the
co-operation of all Nigerians.
</P>
<P>
Lokadang said that his agency was facing such problems as the
earlier order barring them from exercising its duties at the
seaport and decreasing its personnel from 190 to 30 at the airport
without adequate equipment.
</P>
<P>
He noted that he had taken the problems to the National
Assembly and he hoped that they would be reviewed by both the
National Assembly and the federal government.
</P>
<P>
He said the NDLEA had recently arrested two suspects at the
Murtala Muhammed International Airport in Lagos, one with
possession of 6.8 kg of heroin and the other with 2.5 million fake
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
He, therefore, called for the co-operation of banks, bureau de
change and other financial houses to provide necessary assistance
to crack down the money laundering.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Concerned over Detaining of Refugees by Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR)'s regional office in Lusaka Tuesday expressed
concern about the fact that Zambia has detained a large number of
refugees in the past few weeks on a charge of residing in the
capital city of Lusaka without being authorized.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR representative Oluseyi Bajulaiye told a press conference
here Tuesday that the on-going verification exercise conducted by
Zambia's immigration authorities has led to anxiety among refugees
in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions he said that he could not say exactly how
many refugees have been detained but said he believed there are
hundreds.
</P>
<P>
He said UNHCR acknowledges that the Zambian government has
expressed its reservation on the freedom of movement of refugees
in the country when acceding to the Convention on Refugees and
therefore could not be challenged when advocating for refugees to
reside in the designated settlements.
</P>
<P>
"However, we are concerned about the manner in which this
exercise has been conducted which, regrettably, resulted in the
death of two refugees while in detention," said Bajulaiye.
</P>
<P>
Two refugees from the Democratic Republic of the Congo died of
illness without medical attention two weeks in detention,
according to Bajulaiye.
</P>
<P>
Following a high level intervention with the authorities by
UNHCR, a committee will be instituted at the ministry of home
affairs of the country, with the participation of UNHCR, to review
current procedures, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said UNHCR's main objective is to ensure the protection of
bona fide refugees and to safeguard their treatment in line with
international conventions.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime he urged the refugees residing in urban areas
of the country without permit to adhere to the regulations of the
country and to proceed to designated settlements if requested to
do so.
</P>
<P>
According to UNHCR, refugees are unfortunately often perceived
to belong to the same category as illegal immigrants, despite the
fact that they have been formally recognized by the the
government.
</P>
<P>
"Refugees have fled from persecution in their countries of
origin and they deserve our understanding and sympathy," said
Bajulaiye.
</P>
<P>
There are a total of about 220,000 refugees in Zambia, most of
whom come from war-torn Angola and the Democratic Republic of
Congo. About 14,000 refugees are staying urban areas of Zambia.

<HEADLINE> India Ready to Evacuate Sri Lankan Troops Trapped in Jaffna </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 23 (Xinhua) -- India is prepared to evacuate an
estimated 30,000 Sri Lankan troops trapped in Jaffna peninsula
provided there is a formal request from Colombo and "proper
conditions" exist for it, Indian National Security Advisor Brajesh
Mishra said here Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
"If it comes to evacuation, there will have to be proper
conditions for it... If evacuation is desired, obviously there
should be proper conditions for it," Mishra was quoted as saying
by the Press Trust of India (PTI).
</P>
<P>
However, Mishra ruled out any Indian military intervention in
the ongoing conflict in Jaffna, saying: "India is not going to
intervene in the conflict. What we are talking about is
humanitarian assistance."
</P>
<P>
Mishra made this announcement following two rounds of meeting
of India's Cabinet Committee on Security on the evolving situation
in Sri Lanka, which were chaired by Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee, who canceled a domestic visit earlier in the day for the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Indian Defense Minister George Fernandes and three service
chiefs of the armed forces also attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Mishra also told the press that so far there has been no formal
request from Colombo for any humanitarian assistance including an
evacuation.
</P>
<P>
Asked if a cease-fire between the Sri Lankan troops and the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) would be a precondition
for any evacuation by India, Mishra said: "I am not going to spell
it out."
</P>
<P>
In an earlier report on Tuesday, the PTI quoted government
sources as saying Norwegian mediators now in Sri Lanka were in
touch with the LTTE for a safe passage for the evacuation mission.
</P>
<P>
Asked about what will be done in case there was firing, the
sources said ground rules for self-defense during peace missions
were clearly laid down by the United Nations and the Indian Armed
Forces, the PTI reported.

<HEADLINE> Annan Reports Calm Situation in Southern Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 23 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Tuesday said the Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon
continues and the U.N. troops are able to move to the new area
that the Israelis have withdrawn from and things are quiet.
</P>
<P>
"The civilians and masses have not moved in there. I am also
grateful to the president and prime minister of Lebanon whom I
spoke to and asked that they work with us to manage this in an
orderly manner," Annan told the press.
</P>
<P>
"We are coordinating our efforts with both the Israeli and
Lebanese authorities and I hope that the withdrawal can continue
in an orderly manner," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"We are demanding cooperation from State and non-State actors,
including the Hizbollah," the U.N. chief said.
</P>
<P>
"As I have said, we demand cooperation from all. What is
happening on the ground today is encouraging and I would expect
that to continue," he added.
</P>
<P>
Israel informed the United Nations in April that it would
withdraw all its troops from southern Lebanon by July. The
withdrawal began early this month. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak has ordered their withdrawal hastened in the face of
advancing Hizbollah guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Annan recommended to the United Nations Security Council
Monday that the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon be
reinforced in order to carry out the tasks related to confirming
the withdrawal of Israeli troops and to supervise the situation
there.

<HEADLINE> Romania's Exports to Be Affected by Euro Depreciation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Romania's exports will be
adversely affected if the European single currency euro continues
to depreciate, the Ziarul Financiar daily quoted a top banker as
saying on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Cristian Popa, Vice-President of the Romanian National Bank,
said that leu, Romania's national currency, has depreciated by 9.
83 percent against the U.S. dollar since the beginning of this
year, while euro fell only 7.52 percent against dollar.
</P>
<P>
If euro's depreciation continues, it will affect Romanian
exports, of which 65 percent go to the European Union, Popa told
foreign investors at a meeting held during the annual session of
the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development.
</P>
<P>
The euro's current exchange rate is 0.89 to one dollar.
</P>
<P>
Romanian exports are expected to pass the 10 billion dollar
mark for the first time this year, Popa said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Romania's current account had a surplus of 50
million U.S. dollars in the first quarter of this year, comparing
to an annual deficit of 1.3 billion U.S. dollars in 1999.
</P>
<P>
However, the central bank has not revised its forecast of a 1.4
billion U.S. dollars current account deficit for this year because
of the appreciation of leu against euro.

CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands -- The trial of two Libyans suspected
in the bombing of a Pan Am flight in 1988 was adjourned again on
Tuesday soon after it was resumed after a 12-day adjournment.
</P>
<P>
The court had to adjourn again after a technical hitch
developed over the courtroom transcription system that uses state-
of-the-art computers and voice dictation system as court
stenographers.
</P>
<P>
Presiding judge Lord Sutherland said: "It is extremely
regrettable that this should have occurred and the court can only
apologize that the arrangements are not as satisfactory as they
should have been."
</P>
<P>
The court, which was built in a former United States air force
base in central Netherlands, had to be adjourned for 12 days to
allow the prosecution extra time to re-arrange its case after an
out-of-the-court agreement was struck between the prosecution and
the defense team to skip time-consuming court hearings on
undisputed facts.
</P>
<P>
Maintenance work carried out in the courtroom during the
previous adjournment may have otherwise affected the transcription
system though exact cause was not immediately known, the court
spokesman said. (Netherlands-Lockerbie Trial)

<P>
BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- A leading official in the city of
Pingdingshan, central China's Henan Province, received the death
sentence today for his involvement in a hired-killing and bribery
scheme, according to sources from the Supreme People's Court.
</P>
<P>
Li Changhe, former secretary of the political and law committee
of the city, has also been stripped of his political rights for
life by the Intermediate People's Court of Anyang City, Henan
Province.
</P>
<P>
Court investigations showed that in his capacity as the
committee's secretary, Li hired two hit-men to murder Lu Jingyi,
deputy head of a township of Pingdingshan City.
</P>
<P>
Li suspected that Lu was responsible for organizing township
farmers' numerous visits to higher authorities to complain about
the city's illegal collection of fees from farmers.
</P>
<P>
On the evening of June 18, 1999, the two hired killers broke
into Lu's home, fatally stabbed Lu's wife and seriously injured Lu.

The investigations also showed that Li had taken bribes worth
of 138,000 yuan (about 16,000 U.S. dollars) while he was the

<HEADLINE> OAPEC Expects Higher Global Oil Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of Arab
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC) on Tuesday predicted the
world oil demand will reach 77 million barrels per day (bpd) by the
end of this year, up by 1.7 million bpd from last year's 75.3
million bpd.
</P>
<P>
But even with an increase of 2.2 million bpd from the 1999
level, the world will only be able to supply 76.2 million bpd by
the yearend, the OAPEC said in its monthly newsletter.
</P>
<P>
On the world crude demand during the second quarter, the OAPEC
projected a rise of 2.1 million bpd from the same period last year
to reach 75.3 million bpd.
</P>
<P>
According to OAPEC, the world consumed 77.2 million bpd in the
first quarter, rising by 0.9 million bpd compared to the
corresponding period last year.
</P>
<P>
But world oil supply during the first three months of this year
was only 74.9 million bpd, because of a slight drop of 0.2 million
bpd compared with 1999.
</P>
<P>
On world crude demand during the third quarter this year, the
OAPEC expected a hike of 2.3 million bpd from the same quarter last
year to hit 76.8 million bpd.
</P>
<P>
The world's daily consumption of crude in the last quarter of
this year is likely to grow by 1.8 million bpd to reach 77 million
bpd, the OAPEC said.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Fight Illegal Blood Transfusion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government plans to
put in jail for five years those charged with illegally procuring
and distributing blood, blood elements and materials required for
blood transfusion or fine them 50,000 taka (960 U.S. dollars) or
both.
</P>
<P>
In a "Draft Legislation Safe Blood Transfusion-2000," a working
group of the Health and Family Welfare Ministry recommended that
the government give one-year imprisonment or fine 10,000 taka (190
dollars) or both for those responsible for illegal blood
transfusion.
</P>
<P>
The draft policy recommends tougher action against those
responsible for any grave accident or death caused by illegal
transfusion. They should be put in prison for five years, or fined
50,000 taka or both, it suggests.
</P>
<P>
After the introduction of the policy, professional blood donors
will have to get identity cards from the hospitals or
organizations specified by the government.
</P>
<P>
The identity cards will contain the detailed blood donation
status of the donors. Anyone who uses fake identity card, or other
professional blood donor's identity card, will get six months of
imprisonment, or be fined 10,000 taka or both.

JOHANNESBURG, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Sales of passenger cars in
South Africa increased by 27.1 percent to 55,385 units in first
quarter 2000 compared to the same period last year, the National
Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa (NAAMSA)
said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to a report on motor industry manufacturing
conditions prepared by the NAAMSA, commercial vehicle sales for
the same period also increased by 10.2 percent to 27,894 units
over the first quarter 1999.
</P>
<P>
The report added during the first quarter 2000, vehicle
exports were adversely affected by industrial disruption at
Volkswagen South Africa's Uitenhage plant with only 11,633 units
exported in comparison to 59,583 units in the same period of
1999.
</P>
<P>
The NAAMSA said the outlook for growth, based on "prevailing
economic fundamentals", in new vehicle sales during 2000 remains
positive and that an increase of 15 percent for the year as a
whole is expected.
</P>
<P>
However, component companies and assemblers will face "further
 fundamental restructuring to improve international
competitiveness in terms of production costs, service levels,

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Concerned over Detaining of Refugees by Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR)'s regional office in Lusaka Tuesday expressed
concern about the fact that Zambia has detained a large number of
refugees in the past few weeks on a charge of residing in the
capital city of Lusaka without being authorized.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR representative Oluseyi Bajulaiye told a press conference
here Tuesday that the on-going verification exercise conducted by
Zambia's immigration authorities has led to anxiety among refugees
in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions he said that he could not say exactly how
many refugees have been detained but said he believed there are
hundreds.
</P>
<P>
He said UNHCR acknowledges that the Zambian government has
expressed its reservation on the freedom of movement of refugees
in the country when acceding to the Convention on Refugees and
therefore could not be challenged when advocating for refugees to
reside in the designated settlements.
</P>
<P>
"However, we are concerned about the manner in which this
exercise has been conducted which, regrettably, resulted in the
death of two refugees while in detention," said Bajulaiye.
</P>
<P>
Two refugees from the Democratic Republic of the Congo died of
illness without medical attention two weeks in detention,
according to Bajulaiye.
</P>
<P>
Following a high level intervention with the authorities by
UNHCR, a committee will be instituted at the ministry of home
affairs of the country, with the participation of UNHCR, to review
current procedures, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said UNHCR's main objective is to ensure the protection of
bona fide refugees and to safeguard their treatment in line with
international conventions.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime he urged the refugees residing in urban areas
of the country without permit to adhere to the regulations of the
country and to proceed to designated settlements if requested to
do so.
</P>
<P>
According to UNHCR, refugees are unfortunately often perceived
to belong to the same category as illegal immigrants, despite the
fact that they have been formally recognized by the the
government.
</P>
<P>
"Refugees have fled from persecution in their countries of
origin and they deserve our understanding and sympathy," said
Bajulaiye.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR regional office said that it together with partner
organizations and the Zambian government is preparing a
contingency plan for a possible refugee influx from neighboring
Zimbabwe, where.....( editors: please add some background,
thanks).
</P>
<P>
There are a total of about 220,000 refugees in Zambia, most of
whom come from war-torn Angola and the Democratic Republic of
Congo. About 14,000 refugees are staying urban areas of Zambia.

<HEADLINE> Tragedies Reported Over Canada's Long Weekend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- At least eight people died during
Canada's Victoria Day long weekend, traditionally a time to mark
the coming of summer.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Lockerbie Trial Adjourned Again Upon Resumption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The trial of two
Libyans suspected in the bombing of a Pan Am flight in 1988 was
adjourned again on Tuesday soon after it was resumed after a 12-
day adjournment.
</P>
<P>
The court had to adjourn again after a technical hitch
developed over the courtroom transcription system that uses state-
of-the-art computers and voice dictation system as court
stenographers.
</P>
<P>
Presiding judge Lord Sutherland said: "It is extremely
regrettable that this should have occurred and the court can only
apologize that the arrangements are not as satisfactory as they
should have been."
</P>
<P>
The court, which was built in a former United States air force
base in central Netherlands, had to be adjourned for 12 days to
allow the prosecution extra time to re-arrange its case after an
out-of-the-court agreement was struck between the prosecution and
the defense team to skip time-consuming court hearings on
undisputed facts.
</P>
<P>
Maintenance work carried out in the courtroom during the
previous adjournment may have otherwise affected the transcription
system though exact cause was not immediately known, the court
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The Lockerbie trial was adjourned six days after it went
underway almost 12 years after a mid-air explosion of the
commercial aircraft killed 259 people over Scotland and another 11
on the ground in the Scottish town of Lockerbie.
</P>
<P>
Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah were
suspected in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 on December 21, 1988.
</P>
<P>
If found guilty, Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa
Fhimah would be sentenced to life imprisonment and would serve
their jail term in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
If found not guilty or the court could not prove the case
against them, the two accused would be set free.
</P>
<P>
The long-awaited trial is expected to last at least a year and
the court holds sessions almost daily except for a summer recess
between July 28 and August 22.

<HEADLINE> Russia Criticizes NATO-Proposed Unipolar World Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Russia expects a constructive
relationship with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
with the latter's strict commitment to the Russia-NATO Founding
Act, said Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
When addressing the Moscow Institute of International Relations,
Ivanov warned the unipolar world order proposed by the United
States and its NATO allies will lead to NATO-centrism.
</P>
<P>
He said the unipolar world order, implying "the development of
the international security system around a single military-
political alliance," ignores the interests of non-NATO countries
and contradicts the idea of a single democratic Europe accepted by
the West itself.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov also criticized the idea of humanitarian interference
and the underestimation of national sovereignty, saying that any
attempts to "force all countries to adopt single civilized
standards are hopeless."
</P>
<P>
"The Kosovo crisis demonstrated the results of the
implementation of such one-sided ideas of unipolar world order,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"The alternative we are proposing is to develop a democratic
multipolar system of international relations," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ivanov said the Russia-U.S. summit scheduled for
June in Moscow will focus the issues of strategic stability, the
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) and the Anti-Ballistic
Missile (ABM) treaty.
</P>
<P>
"The destruction of the 1972 ABM treaty will unavoidably force
Russia to take adequate measures to guarantee its own national
security, even to withdraw from START," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia will continue to hold active dialogue with the
United States to try to find solutions "to the most complicated
problems."

<P>
URUMQI, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Wang Zhaoguo, vice-chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), has stressed here today the importance of
upholding the political system of multi-party cooperation and
political consultation.
</P>
<P>
Wang, also head of the United Front Work Department of the
Chinese Communist Party (CPC) Central Committee, noted that it is
imperative to recognize the advantages of the system and create a

</P>
<P>
Wang made the remarks at a recent meeting here with leaders of
the non-Communist parties and the federation of industry and
commerce of northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The key to evaluating a political system's success or failure
is to see whether the system conforms to the specific condition of
the country, and whether it is conducive to the country's
stability, to the unity of the nationalities and to the economic
development,
</P>
<P>
China's political system under the CPC leadership has been
playing a bigger role in the country's political life and

drive, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Wang also spoke highly of the achievements
made by the region's non-Communist parties, the personages without

<HEADLINE> Thailand Denies Allegation of Shelter for Myanmar People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has denied a recent
allegation made by a state-run Myanmar newspaper that Thailand has
provided shelter for Myanmar's displaced ethnic Karen persons for
political and economic interests from illicit trade.
</P>
<P>
In response to the allegation of the New Light of Myanmar
published on May 9, a press release of the Thai Embassy here
quoted the Thai Foreign Ministry as saying the problem of
displaced persons from Myanmar, mostly ethnic Karens, is one of
the problems arising from Myanmar's internal situation.
</P>
<P>
These problems, which Thailand has been facing, include illegal
workers,displaced persons, students and political asylum-seekers
and crimes, the embassy said.
</P>
<P>
The press release, available here on Tuesday, charged that
these problems originated from the economic and political
situation in Myanmar over the past 15 years and they have spilled
over into Thailand.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are about 102,000 Myanmar displaced persons
in Thailand's five provinces bordering Myanmar, it said.
</P>
<P>
It is impossible for Thailand to gain any benefit in terms of
economy from the displaced persons, mostly women, children and the
elderly who fled the fighting between the Myanmar government
troops and anti-government forces and sought sanctuary in Thailand,
the press release said.
</P>
<P>
"On the contrary, Thailand has to bear the burden and adverse
repercussions caused by giving shelter and looking after these
displaced persons," it complained.
</P>
<P>
The press release said Thailand aspires sustainable progress,
development and peace in neighboring countries, hoping that all
Myanmar displaced persons seeking shelter in Thailand will
finally be able to return to their homeland in safety and dignity
to participate in their national development.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Negotiator Meets Abu Sayyaf Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- A Philippine government negotiator
working for the release of 21 mostly foreign hostages held by the
Abu Sayyaf in the southern Philippines met with two high-ranking
commanders of the extremist group Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
According to the Philippine News Agency, Sulu Governor
Abdusakur Tan met with Ghalib Andang, alias Commander Robot, and
Commander Mujib Susukanat at about 3:30 p.m. in Patikul, some 12
kilometers northeast of Jolo, capital of Sulu Province.
</P>
<P>
Tan said the two Abu Sayyaf commanders presented their written
demands to him in a closed-door meeting, the first face-to-face
meeting between government negotiators and Abu Sayyaf leaders
since the beginning of the hostage crisis on April 23.
</P>
<P>
However, the Sulu governor didn't elaborate on the demands with
due respect to chief government negotiator Secretary Robert
Aventajado who left Jolo for Manila Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"Secretary Aventajado is expected to arrive here tomorrow(
Wednesday) for the final talks," Tan said in Jolo, adding that he
will inform the National Flagship Project adviser about the
hostage-takers' demands Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
The hostages being held in the hinterlands of Patikul town by
the Sulu-based Abu Sayyaf were taken from a diving resort in
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf leaders refused to appear Monday in Patikul for
a meeting with Aventajado allegedly due to the security
arrangement which was without proper coordination.
</P>
<P>
Aventajado said Tuesday that he is willing to face the leaders
of the Abu Sayyaf alone as a gesture of goodwill and that he hopes
the hostage takers would consider it favorably.
</P>
<P>
"I guess I have to be a little bit bolder. Perhaps I should
really go in alone, and that's what I intend to do next time," he
said in Manila after meeting with President Joseph Estrada in the
Presidential Palace.
</P>
<P>
He also voiced optimism that the Abu Sayyaf will release ailing
German hostage Renate Wallert, adding that the government is
likely to agree to a reported proposal that Wallert be released to
the media.
</P>
<P>
Aventajado said he expects to meet with the hostage-takers'
leaders some time this week, after the initial meeting scheduled
for Monday failed to materialize.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Signs Banking Act </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
signed into law Tuesday the General Banking Act that aims to
safeguard the integrity of the banking system and give the Central
Bank of the Philippines more power to supervise financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the signing ceremony in the Presidential Palace,
the president expressed confidence that the act would play a key
role in sustaining and accelerating the progress of the Philippine
economy.
</P>
<P>
"I see this new law as very significant in our efforts to
sustain the positive growth of our economy in the new millennium,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The act provides for the regulation of the organization and
operations of banks, quasi-banks and trust entities and for other
purposes.
</P>
<P>
The new law also enhances the supervisory capability and
enforcement powers of the central bank and raises prudential
standards to international norms.
</P>
<P>
It further fosters greater competition in the banking system,
the president pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Under the new law, the banking industry can promote
competitiveness by updating the classification of banks,
simplifying the citizenship of banks and ownership by related
interest and reducing minimum Filipino ownership in banks to 60
percent of voting stock.
</P>
<P>
The banking industry can also improve prudential standards by
strengthening provisions against overexposure of a bank to
director,officer, stockholder and related interests loans, said
the president.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, the law allows qualified foreign banks to own 100
percent of the total voting stock of a distressed bank and gives
the central bank the power to issue, revoke, suspend, or annul
authority to engage in banking.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa Urges Talks Between Ethiopia, Eritrea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 23 (Xinhua) -- South Africa urged Ethiopia
and Eritrea to resume peace talks under an agreement brokered by
the Organization of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
Briefing reporters in Pretoria on Tuesday after meeting
Ethiopian envoy Kisle Wodajo on renewed fighting between
Ethiopia and Eritrea, Deputy Minister of South African Foreign
Affairs Department Aziz Pahad said: "We are very concerned. It
adds to a very alarming intensity of Afro-pessimism. "
</P>
<P>
Talks between the two countries on a two-year-old border
dispute broke down on May 4 in Algiers after Ethiopia accused
Eritrea of setting preconditions.
</P>
<P>
The two countries renewed clashes along borders eight days
later, which prompted the United States to evacuate U.S. citizens
and some diplomatic staff from Eritrea's capital of Asmara.
</P>
<P>
Pahad said he has also been briefed by Eritrean Ambassador to
South Africa Girma Asmerom on the new outbreak of violence.
</P>
<P>
"My message to both sides was that hostilities should end and
that talks should resume to resolve the dispute within the
framework of the OAU agreement," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will interact with the OAU and give our support to its
initiatives to bring an end to this border dispute." Pahad
added. Continued conflict in several African countries is
increasing pessimistic attitudes about the future of the
continent,
</P>
<P>
Pahad said South Africa is not only worried about the
breakdown of peace in the Horn of Africa but also about conflict
in Sierra Leone, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Angola and
developments in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
"We have determined that this should be the African century.
All conflict adds to Afro-pessimism and loss of investor
confidence, making it more difficult to achieve sustainable
development," he said.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Lycos Seeks Stronger Partnership in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 23 (Xinhua) -- About two years ago, it was a
rare thing that people in Beijing talked about the Internet, but
now everybody is talking about it, said Eric Gerritsen, the U.S.-
based Lycos vice-president for international business development.
</P>
<P>
"In a very short period of time, it's all started to happen,"
Gerritsen said, sharing his recent experience in China's Internet
development.
</P>
<P>
He told Xinhua on Tuesday that it is of strategic importance
for Lycos to have a strong business in China.
</P>
<P>
Gerritsen's last trip to China was seven months ago. And now he
is in Hong Kong this week for the launch of the Lycos Hong Kong
site. On Monday, Lycos Asia, a 50-50 joint venture founded last
year between Lycos and Singapore Telecommunications, launched its
Hong Kong, Taiwan and mainland sites.
</P>
<P>
"We have been eager to participate in China's web market and
seek stronger partnership in the country since it has a massive 80
million Internet audience in the country," Gerritsen said.
</P>
<P>
"It is quite a different country today in many ways compared
with 14 yeas ago when I made first trip there, and from a
commercial point of view, things are getting better all the time
in China," the Lycos vice-president said.
</P>
<P>
The environment for Internet industry investment has been
improved greatly in China since the Internet made a start in the
country a few years ago, Gerritsen said, adding that China's
coming entry into the World Trade Organization will help that
situation dramatically.
</P>
<P>
Gerritsen said he is pretty confident about his company's
competence in China's market since it is a market big enough for
international players to do business.
</P>
<P>
"I think that there is a large new breed of architectural
talent and intellectual capital, but the access to capital remains
a challenge," Gerritsen said. Probably over a period of time, Hong
Kong will continue to play its role in raising money for Internet
ventures in the region, he added.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on China's policy on the Internet industry,
Gerritsen said every country has its own reasons to do the things
it does. "We take a similar approach in all 29 countries around
the world where we operate business, and as we do business in that
environment we must meet the environment," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Gerritsen expressed his wish that his company would provide the
Chinese people with world-class, localized services in the same
way they have done in 29 other countries. He said they expected to
get the official business license into China and set up their
offices there within two months.
</P>
<P>
Lycos Asia, as the third biggest powerhouse for Internet
content, offers a full spectrum of web services, including news, e-
mail, chat, message and different types of vertical content and
information, such as fashion, sports, women issues, children and
programming.
</P>
<P>
Reportedly, the recent merger between Lycos and Spain's Terra
Networks will result in a global Internet company with 3 billion U.
S. dollars in cash and ambitions to dominate the world portal
market.

<HEADLINE> Global Gold Demand Remains Strong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Global gold demand remained
strong during the first quarter of the year, registering a total
of 795.2 tons, according to the World Gold Council in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Publishing its quarterly survey, Gold Demand Trends, Tuesday,
the World Gold Council said the January-March period of this year
maintained level of the first quarter of 1999, when demand went on
to set a record for the full year.
</P>
<P>
Demand for jewelry was 701 tons, 7 percent above the first
quarter of 1999 and a record for the period. Consumption was
buoyant in many countries, helped by the improving global economy,
according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
The volatility in the gold price prompted consumers in some
countries to defer jewelry purchases, but the World Gold Council
indicated that improving economic prospects should support healthy
demand over the remainder of the year.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that Turkey, countries in Southeast Asia,
Brazil, Mexico and Britain registered outstanding gains in jewelry
consumption during the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
The demand for gold as an investment was 94.2 tons, 29 percent
below the level of a year ago, with a sharp fall in sales of new
coins in the United States, accounting for almost all the decline.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Experts See Bright Future of China's Stock Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. securities experts
participating in an ongoing international symposium on stock
market regulation and development here said that China's stock
markets have a bright future.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 15 years, China's stock markets have achieved
notable progress, especially in their supervision and building of
the legal structure, said Robert D. Strahota, deputy director of
the Office of International Affairs of the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes that China's stock markets have good
development prospects.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Robert W. Hillman from a university in California has
conducted an in-depth study of the legal foundation of China's
stock markets. He said that China's Securities Law has left a deep
impression on him.
</P>
<P>
Hillman suggested that China establish independent accounting
rules as soon as possible so as to ensure the standardization of
the check of accounting.
</P>
<P>
While speaking highly of China's achievements in stock markets,
David Berger, a noted American attorney, also criticized the lack
of information available about the stock market.
</P>
<P>
Many large Western firms and groups want to invest in China,
but they are skeptical of the accuracy of information available on
the market. Therefore, they are forced to find information through
their own channels, which hikes up their investment costs, Berger
said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. securities experts suggested that China set up a
arbitration agency soon for the protection of the interests of
stock market investors.
</P>
<P>
The three-day symposium is jointly sponsored by the China
Securities Regulatory Commission, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and
Duke University of the United States.

<HEADLINE> Pak Vows to Maintain Nuclear Deterrence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan said Tuesday that it
will maintain credible nuclear deterrence to prevent any
aggression against it.
</P>
<P>
"We will act according to our best national security and
national interest," Pakistan's Foreign Office spokesman Iftikhar
Murshid said at a press conference here while answering a question
about reported possible further nuclear tests by India.
</P>
<P>
"Our nuclear policy is to maintain credible nuclear deterrence,
" he added.
</P>
<P>
In a statement he made on behalf of Pakistan's Foreign Minister
Abdul Sattar, the spokesman regretted the position taken by the
Sixth Review Conference on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (
NPT) toward the nuclear tests conducted by India and Pakistan in
May 1998.
</P>
<P>
"We did not initiate the induction of weapons capability into
the region. Nor was Pakistan the first to conduct nuclear
explosive tests," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It accused India's nuclear tests of destabilizing the security
environment in South Asia, saying Pakistan's tests "restored the
strategic balance."
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, the distinction between the nuclear ambitions of
India and the compulsions of Pakistan must be acknowledged and
preserved," it said.
</P>
<P>
The sixth NPT review conference, which Pakistan "decided not to
attend because of the changed nuclear realities in South Asia,"
ended in New York on May 20.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan expressed its appreciation of the conference's call
for the observance of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT),
describing it as "a positive contribution to the strengthening of
the no-test norm."
</P>
<P>
"Having voted for the CTBT in 1996 and declared a unilateral
moratorium on further tests in 1998, Pakistan will maintain its
policy of responsibility and restraint," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Neither Pakistan nor India has so far signed the CTBT, which
will not gain effect until all the 44 countries concerned sign and
ratify it.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Improve Education Management Systems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Education Minister Godfrey Miyanda disclosed this at a
symposium on learning achievement at the middle basic level in
Lusaka on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The minister said by improving the education provision, the
government is also making investments in the assessment systems
that would independently assess learning outcomes free of
prejudice but based on verifiable data.
</P>
<P>
"We have successfully put in place a system that is able to
provide information on the levels of learning achievement at a
particular time, for a given grade and within a prescribed
context," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the national assessment would be based on
specific objectives, among them, to provide information on the
provision of educational imputs that are seen as impacting on
learning outcomes in order to increase access and participation.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the government would hold nothing back in
striving to improve the delivery of the education system as
articulated in the national educational policy.
</P>
<P>
"We are implementing the policy in a methodical manner and in
phased strategies," Miyanda said. "We shall be as transparent and
as objective as is humanly possible in our effort to improve our
education delivery system," he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on all citizens to desist from using their party
political spectacles and help in the re-shaping and reconstruction
of the education sector in the country in order to address this
serious national problem.

<P>
TOKYO, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Foreign Minister Yohei Kono
on Tuesday blasted Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara for his recent
remarks attacking Chinese leader and suggested that Japan will not
allow a visit by Taiwan's Lee Teng-hui.
</P>
<P>
"As foreign minister, I must say the remarks (made by Ishihara)
were extremely deplorable," Kono told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The governor, as a person in public service, breached a code of
respect toward the head of a nation, Kono added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Ishihara's comment made in Taiwan last Saturday
that "one China, one Taiwan will do", Kono said, "His remarks are
completely different from the (Japanese central) government's
position."
</P>
<P>
The Japanese foreign minister stressed that Japan will continue
to respect Beijing's "one-China" policy under the 1972 Japan-China
joint communique.
</P>
<P>
As for Lee Teng-hui's reported plan to visit Japan, Kono
expressed caution over such a trip in view of Lee's "political
influence."
</P>
<P>
"We can't say that he is a private figure if he still has
political influence," Kono said, suggesting that Japan will not
allow the visit.

<HEADLINE> HK Registers Drop in Industrial Accidents in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong reported a drop of 16.4
percent in industrial accidents in 1999 to 35,986, compared with
43,034 in the previous year, Matthew Cheung Kin-chung,
commissioner for labor of Hong Kong, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The accident rate per thousand workers had also come down from
64.7 in 1998 to 55.1 last year, a drop of 14.9 percent, he added,
noting that these figures demonstrate a steady improvement in the
safety performance of the industrial sector.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department and the Occupational Safety and Health
Council signed the Occupational Safety Charter with the Chinese
Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the signing ceremony, Cheung said the safety
charter, though not a legal document, projected the very important
message of "shared responsibilities" by employers, employees and
the government.
</P>
<P>
He noted that employers should shoulder the primary
responsibility of providing a safe workplace while employees
should render full cooperation to ensure their safety and that of
others.
</P>
<P>
The government, for its part, would also promote occupational
safety and health with legislative support, publicity activities
and training, he added.

<HEADLINE> HK Consumer Prices Down 4.4 Percent in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Consumer prices of Hong Kong in
overall terms registered a year-on-year rate of decrease of 4.4
percent in April 2000, smaller than the 5-percent fall in March
this year, according to the Census and Statistics Department of
Hong Kong Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Releasing the Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures for April 2000,
the department indicated that the smaller year-on-year decreases
in the CPIs in April were mainly attributable to lesser declines
in the prices of basic foodstuffs and certain durable goods, as
well as in the charges for miscellaneous services due to higher
charges for package tours and a reduced decline in charges for
long-distance calls.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, there were larger increases in the costs of
fuel and light and in the prices of miscellaneous goods, mainly
due to a lower base of comparison in April last year caused by a
rebate in electricity charges by a power company and a cut in the
prices of some newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Taking the first four months of 2000 together, the Composite
CPI dropped by 4.9 percent as compared with the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
A government secretariat spokesman noted that the lesser
declines in consumer prices revealed lately went together with a
continued distinct pickup in retail business in the more recent
months.
</P>
<P>
There was also some renewed price pressure from external
sources affecting local consumer prices, upon a distinct rebound
in world commodity prices and the earlier appreciation of the
Japanese yen, the spokesman added.

<HEADLINE> HK Transport Advisers Discuss Railway Development Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Six new railway projects that
will cost a total of 80 billion to 100 billion HK dollars (10.2
billion to 12.8 billion U.S. dollars) in 1998 prices have been
planned in Hong Kong's new railway development strategy, according
to the Transport Advisory Committee (TAC) of Hong Kong Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Discussing the railway development strategy, TAC members noted
that six projects scheduled for completion between 2008 and 2016
would help expand Hong Kong's present network by at least 70
percent to more than 250 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
By then, more than 70 percent of Hong Kong's total population
and 80 percent of the employed would be within walking distance
from the railway stations and it would also help reduce vehicle
emissions of some 600 tons of air pollutants and 160,000 tons of "
greenhouse" gas a year, members said.
</P>
<P>
"The government had formulated a new railway development
strategy based on the findings of the Second Railway Development
Study. The TAC fully supports the strategy as railway is the more
efficient and environmentally-friendly mode of transport which
suits Hong Kong's needs," said Cheng Hon-kwan, chairman of TAC.
</P>
<P>
"The new railway development would serve Hong Kong's needs
arising from our continued economic development and increases in
population growth and cross-boundary activities for the next two
decades.
</P>
<P>
"The expanded network would boost the rail share to about 45
percent of the public transport system and function as the
backbone of the transport system to serve the transport needs of
the community in a sustainable manner," he said.

<HEADLINE> China Issues Rule on JV Hospitals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- China has renewed administrative
measures governing Sino-overseas joint-venture (JV) hospitals and
clinics, hoping the sector's sound development can provide people
a wide range of health care services.
</P>
<P>
According to a rule newly-published by ministries of health and
foreign trade and economic cooperation, overseas hospitals and
firms can launch joint ventures in China after they get permission
from the two ministries.
</P>
<P>
Solely overseas-funded hospitals are still not allowed in China.
</P>
<P>
A JV hospital should be internationally advanced in equipment,
technology and management, and should be able to provide service
that local hospitals can not give, stipulated the rule which goes
into effect on July 1.
</P>
<P>
Investment in a JV hospital should not be less than 20 million
yuan (about 2.4 million U.S. dollars), stock shares of the Chinese
side should not be less than 30 percent, and the term of JV
hospitals should not exceed 20 years.
</P>
<P>
However, exceptions may be made for hospitals opening in China'
s central and western regions, as well as remote and poor areas.
</P>
<P>
Investors from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan will have to obey
this rule when launching JV hospitals in the mainland.
</P>
<P>
China is reforming its hospitals by dividing them into not-for-
profit and for-profit categories, and will exercise different fee-
charging and taxation policies. Most JV hospitals are expected to
fall into the for-profit classification.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that there are about 200 JV hospitals and
clinics in 19 Chinese provinces; however, only 18 hospitals and
some 60 clinics have official permits.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Ministry of Health (MOH) said the rule
aimed to "create a healthy environment for development of this
sector."

<HEADLINE> Israeli FM, U.S. Ambassador Discuss Israeli Pullout  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Israel's troop withdrawal from
south Lebanon has been carried out in line with the United Nations
Security Council Resolution 425, said Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters after his meeting with U.S. ambassador to
Israel Martin Indyk in which the two discussed Israel's pullout
from south Lebanon, Levy said Israel has close contacts with U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan on this issue and the two sides had
coordinated over the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Israel welcomes the U.N. decision to send peacekeeping forces
into vacated areas in south Lebanon, but Israel also has the
capability to defend its northern territory after the pullout, Levy
added.
</P>
<P>
Levy said Israel's redeployment from south Lebanon early Tuesday
has put Israel in a better position to face the changes of
situation in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel will strike sharply at any targets in Lebanon if it was
attacked during or after the withdrawal, he warned.
</P>
<P>
Israel has informed the Syrian and Lebanese governments about
this policy through certain channels and it hopes that the two
governments understand this, Levy said.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian government has the responsibility to rein in Lebanese
military groups such as Hezbollah to prevent them from taking any
military actions against Israel, Levy said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Israel will provide all kinds of assistance to the
South Lebanon Army (SLA) militiamen and their families who choose
to enter Israel from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Reports from northern Israel said that around 1,600 SLA members
and their family members have already crossed the borders into
northern Israel till Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Israeli militia has a total of 2,500 members and over
10,000 family members.
</P>
<P>
Indyk reportedly told Levy during the meeting that the United
States fully supports Israel's withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. also urged Syria to take measures to help the Lebanese
government implement the U.N. resolution regarding Israel's
pullout, he said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has informed the
Syrian government of the Israeli withdrawal and warned that Syria
should bear the consequence of any further attacks against Israel
by Lebanese groups during or after the pullout, Indyk said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli troops evacuated from the Bint Jebeil outpost in the
central sector of the security zone early Tuesday, marking the
beginning of a full-scale troop withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ehud Barak said Tuesday that Israel would
complete the troop withdrawal within the next few days, more than a
month ahead of the initially scheduled July 7 deadline.

<HEADLINE> Fiji's Indigenous Chiefs Reject Coup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Fiji's powerful chiefs Tuesday
night rejected coup leader George Speight's claims to power and
demanded he set free the nation's prime minister and cabinet who
were taken hostage last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Great Council of Chiefs also declared its support for
President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara's own plans to "return Fiji to
normalcy," former Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka announced.
</P>
<P>
"They do not approve of what Mr. Speight has done, although
they have a lot of sympathy for the views expressed by his
supporters," Rabuka said after chairing the meeting of the
influential, hereditary chiefs.
</P>
<P>
The chiefs' decision appears to have destroyed Speight's hopes
of winning popular indigenous Fijian support for his armed bid to
overthrow Mahendra Chaudhry, Fiji's first ethnic Indian prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
But Speight Tuesday tonight remained defiant, accusing Mara of
misleading the chiefs to protect his own power base.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Speight demanded Mara to reassess his position
and stand down as president "before the situation escalates and
becomes uncontrollable."
</P>
<P>
Seized at gunpoint last Friday, Chaudhry and up to 20 hostages
Tuesday night remained imprisoned by Speight's men at parliament
house in capital Suva.
</P>
<P>
Chaudhry was reportedly suffering serious injuries after a
brutal assault by his masked captors.
</P>
<P>
The Great Council of Chiefs will on Wednesday examine Mara's
proposed solution to the political crisis, which may involve a
call on Chaudhry to stand down as leader to make way for an
indigenous Fijian prime minister.
</P>
<P>
"That is a possibility," agreed Rabuka, who led two military
coups in 1987 to depose an Indian-dominated government.
</P>
<P>
He said options included Chaudhry dissolving parliament to hold
new elections, or recommending that someone else in his government
be appointed prime minister to pacify indigenous Fijians unhappy
with the administration.
</P>
<P>
"Those are the constitutionally sustainable moves that can take
place," Rabuka said.
</P>
<P>
The council of chiefs is a key institution for indigenous
Fijians. While its role is theoretically advisory, council
agreement is deemed crucial for most major political decisions in
Fiji.
</P>
<P>
The chiefs will also discuss whether Speight should be granted
an amnesty, although Rabuka said he personally expected the coup
leader to be arrested for treason.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Stricter Protection of World Heritage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SUZHOU, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese officials and experts
attending a national conference here today called for stricter
protection of world heritage.
</P>
<P>
"Greater efforts should be made to protect world heritage sites
and ban the construction of facilities that are not in harmony
with these sites," said Ma Zishu, deputy director of the State
Administration of Cultural Heritage, at the National Working
Conference on World Heritage which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
The three-day meeting, co-sponsored by the China National
Commission for UNESCO, the State Administration of Cultural
Heritage, and the Ministry of Construction, is focusing on delving
into urgent problems to protect world heritage sites.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xuezhong, secretary general of the China National
Commission for UNESCO, said that China has made significant
progress in protecting its rich cultural heritage.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that 23 of the country's scenic spots and
historical sites, such as Mount Taishan and the Imperial Palace,
have been put on the World Heritage list.
</P>
<P>
China now ranks fourth in the world in terms of the number of
world heritage sites, following Italy, Spain and France.
</P>
<P>
Applications for more places of historic interest and scenic
beauty to be listed as world heritage sites are subject to the
approval of UNESCO.
</P>
<P>
However, China and many other countries, face problems such as
excessive logging and inappropriate construction at world heritage
sites.
</P>
<P>
Yang Luyu, Vice Minister of Construction, said that laws and
regulations should be further improved to ensure the protection of
these sites. Measures must be taken to increase the public
awareness of the importance of world heritage protection, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released in January this year, there
are 630 world heritage sites in 116 countries.

<HEADLINE> Small Hydro-Electric Power Projects Benefit Rural China (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Distributed in 1,500 poor counties across the country, the
potential generating capacity for small hydro-electric power
projects may top 100 million kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
More than 800 of these counties have constructed small hydro-
electric power stations, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting attended by hundreds of energy experts
from 20 countries and regions worldwide, Tian said that small
hydro-electric power projects are in many ways superior to large
power plants or water-control projects. These small projects will
not cause environmental pollution, he said, adding that there will
be no need to resettle large numbers of residents to other areas.
</P>
<P>
There are still 75 million rural residents who do not have
access to power supply. Sixty-five million poor rural residents
depend on burning foliage as their daily fuel. They use 600
million tons of foliage as fuel each year, he said.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, plant burning also damages the environment
and results in soil erosion, and in some cases, leads to flooding,
" he added.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 20 years, China has also carried out a series of
favorable policies to encourage the construction of small hydro-
electric power projects in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
This will help China build a comprehensive network of power
grids to boost economic development in these vast rural areas, the
official said.

<P>
GUILIN, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Small hydro-electric power stations
have provided about 300 million farmers in western China's rural
area with electricity.
</P>
<P>
About half of China's rural areas and 25 percent of rural
residents now have electricity. They no longer depend on
traditional rosin resources for fuel thanks to the country's
effort in building small hydro-electric power stations,
</P>
<P>
A senior official with the Ministry of Water Resources (MWR)
said at the World Energy Council aession, which opened here in
Guilin today, in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, China built 43,000 small hydro-
electric power stations in rural areas, providing an annual total
of 72 billion kwh, said Tian Shen, deputy director of the MWR
Hydro-Electric Power Bureau.
</P>
<P>
These stations generated an annual income of 30 billion yuan,
playing an important role in local economic development, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
China spends on average 13 billion yuan in building small hydro-
electric power projects every year, Tian said. By 2005, the
projects will have a combined annual power generating capacity of
30 million kilowatts and will provide rural areas with 132 billion
kwh of electricity.

<HEADLINE> One-China Principle Is Not Saddled on Taiwan: Xinhua Commentary (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Xinhua News Agency today published
a signed commentary, entitling "One-China Principle Is Not Saddled
on Taiwan", criticizing the May 20 speech by new Taiwan leader for
his not recognizing the One-China Principle.
</P>
<P>
It indicates that the new Taiwan leader does not want to
improve cross-Straits ties.
</P>
<P>
"Is it so difficult to recognize the One-China Principle?" the
commentary asks.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has been part of China since ancient times, though it was
ceded to Japan in 1895 by the Qing dynasty (1644-1911). The
victory of the War of Resistance Against the Japanese Aggression (
1937-1945) enabled the Chinese government to recover the island
province.
</P>
<P>
The facts that there is only one China, that Taiwan is part of
China, and that the people of Taiwan are part of China have never
been changed.
</P>
<P>
The commentary noted that since 1949, the Taiwan Authorities
had for long adhered to the One-China Principle, which had been
recorded in Taiwan's "constitutional" documents and speeches of
all former Taiwan leaders including Lee Teng-hui.

<HEADLINE> One-China Principle Is Not Saddled on Taiwan: Xinhua Commentary (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Insistence on the One-China Principle on both sides of the
Straits has ensured cross-Straits peace and exchanges, the
commentary said, noting that Taiwan people, though having doubts
about immediate reunification due to a number of factors, widely
agree with the principle.
</P>
<P>
The commentary condemns Lee Teng-hui for abandoning the
original stance of the Taiwan Authorities and gradually betraying
and denying the One-China Principle. Lee attempted to separate
Taiwan from China radically by proposing the "two-states" remarks,
it said.
</P>
<P>
The commentary quotes the May 20 statement by the Taiwan Work
Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (
CPC) and the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council as saying
that the mainland is willing to hold cross-Straits talks and
negotiations based on the One-China Principle and realize visits
by leaders of the two sides.
</P>
<P>
"So long as the Taiwan authorities make a clear commitment that
it will not accept the 'two-states remarks,' and that it will
adhere to the consensus reached between the Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) and Taiwan's Strait
Exchange Foundation in 1992 that the two sides will express in
their own way that 'the two sides of the Straits both adhere to
the One-China principle,' we would like to authorize ARATS to
contact and hold dialogues with organizations or persons
authorized by the Taiwan side."
</P>
<P>
The commentary stressed that "Taiwan independence" is a road to
destruction, reiterating that the Taiwan issue cannot continue to
be unresolved indefinitely.

BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Experts from the Taiwan Institute
of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences today criticized the new
Taiwan leader for his blurry and evasive remarks on the One-China
Principle in his speech on May 20.
</P>
<P>
They blamed him for lacking sincerity and goodwill for
improving and developing cross-Straits ties and urged him to
follow historical trends, stop advocating secessionist views, and
return to the One-China Principle.
</P>
<P>
The speakers showed their firm support for the May 20 statement
jointly issued by the Taiwan Work Office of the Central Committee
of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the Taiwan Affairs
Office of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Separatism and "Taiwan independence" in any form will never
succeed and will not be tolerated by the Chinese people including
the people of Taiwan, the experts agreed.
</P>
<P>
They urged the new Taiwan leader to join cross-Straits talks
and negotiations under the One-China Principle so as to push
forward the development of the cross-Straits relations.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Conduct Census in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Central Bureau of
Statistic (BPS) announced here Tuesday that it will conduct a
population census in June 2000.
</P>
<P>
The bureau predicted that Indonesian population within the
current year would grow by 1.46 percent but expected the growth
rate to decline to 1.36 percent in the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
"The census in the year 2000 will be carried out on June 1-30
nationwide. All inhabitants living in the country, including
expatriates living here and Indonesian nationals living overseas,
will be counted, " BPS head Suwito told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
But he added that diplomatic members will be excluded from the
census target.
</P>
<P>
Suwito predicted that the number of Indonesian population in
June 2000 will reach 208 million.
</P>
<P>
"That is why we have prepared at least 300,000 well-trained
census takers to make the program successful," he said.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that initial result of the first census in the third
millenium could be announced by mid August this year while the
final result will be publicly announced by April 2001.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government has provided at least 305.8 billion
rupiah (44 million U.S. dollars) to finance the census.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has so far taken four censuses. The first one was
carried out in 1961 and the last in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Anwar Files Appeal on Mahathir's Testimony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's former Deputy Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim Tuesday filed his petition of appeal
against the High Court's ruling not to call Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad as a witness in his sodomy trial.
</P>
<P>
The petition, filed by one of his counsel, Sankaran Nair, at
the Court of Appeal registry here, contains 10 grounds of appeal,
Bernama news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The petition was filed together with a certificate of urgency
that the matter should be heard as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Anwar's sodomy trial has been postponed indefinitely after High
Court judge Arifin Jaka allowed Anwar to appeal against his
decision pertaining to Mahathir's testimony.
</P>
<P>
Justice Arifin ruled that to call Mahathir to testify in the
trial would be an abuse of the court process and it was his duty
to refrain such thing from happening.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, 52, now serving a six-year jail sentence upon conviction
on four counts of corrupt practice of interfering in police
investigations into allegations of his sexual misconduct, is
jointly tried with his adopted brother Sukma Darmawan Sasmitaat
Madja, 39, on separate charges of sodomizing his former family
driver Azizan Abu Bakar.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, also former finance minister, was sacked from the
Cabinet on September 2, 1998.

<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen
left here Tuesday with a government delegation to participate in
the Consultative Group (CG) meeting to be held in Paris from May
24 to 26.
</P>
<P>
The delegation includes Foreign Minister Hor Namhong, Finance
Minister Keat Chhon, Minister of Council of Ministers Sok An and
other senior government officials.
</P>
<P>
At the fourth CG meeting, the government is seeking an
estimated 1.5 billion U.S. dollars in aid for next three years and
it is optimistic that they will be able to obtain the funds.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, the government will present its report on what has
been achieved in reform process and the reason for the
shortcomings, and donors will judge Cambodia's performance to
decide how much aid to give. From 1992-98, Cambodia received 2.7
billion dollars from the donors, according to an October report by
Finance Minister Keat Chhon.
</P>
<P>
A total of 17 donor countries and seven international finance
organizations will participate the three-day meeting hosted by the
World Bank.
</P>
<P>
At the last CG meeting held in February 1999 in Tokyo, Cambodia
got 470 million dollars in aid, exceeding Cambodia's 450 million
dollars request.
</P>
<P>
In return, Hun Sen promised to undertake such reforms as
downsizing the armed forces, cracking down on illegal logging and
corruption. He also agreed to allow donor nations to check on the
progress of reforms every three months.

<HEADLINE> Former TNI Chief Undergoes Questioning Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- As a follow up of last week's
investigation, the Indonesian Attorney General Office (AGO) on
Tuesday examined again former Indonesian Military (TNI) Chief Gen.
ret) Wiranto as a witness in human rights abuse case in East Timor
which took place last year.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by members of the TNI's legal defender team,
Wiranto appeared at the AGO at around 09:00 a.m. local time, and
has not left the AGO as of 04:00 p.m.
</P>
<P>
Chandra Motik, a member of TNI's lawyer team, said that Wiranto
is grilled in connection with his policies as a TNI chief when the
riots took place in East Timor in 1999.
</P>
<P>
But she said in an interview with Xinhua Tuesday afternoon that
"I don't think that Wiranto will be declared as suspect in human
rights abuse case in East Timor. There are no evidences leading to
such a direction."
</P>
<P>
Another member of the TNI's lawyer team, Ruhut Sitompul, said "
There are no specific questions in the course of today's
investigation. Everything is running well."
</P>
<P>
Wiranto was suspended from his duties as Coordinating Minister
for Politics and Security Affairs by President Abdurrahman Wahid
in February this year on the charges of his involvement in the
human rights abuse in East Timor in which hundreds of people were
killed.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto has said that he would formally resign from the post
and cooperate with the prosecutors to uncover "the real truth"
about what happened in East Timor in 1999 after the territory
voted in favor of independence through a U.N.-sponsored direct
ballot.

<HEADLINE> Riot Breaks Out Again in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Sectarian riot broke out again in
the Poso city, Indonesia's Central Sulawesi province, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Antara News Agency quoted witnesses as saying that three
persons have died, two on site and one at the hospital, and 15
others have been injured. But the local police said there was only
one casualty.
</P>
<P>
The police refused to disclose the reason for the clash but
local people told Antara that it erupted after an unidentified
group of people attacked a security post in a Muslim area.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Poso, about 2,000 kilometers northeast of
Jakarta, was still tense as about a dozen houses and places of
worship in Sayo and Mo Engko Baru villages were on fire.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people, mostly women and children, have fled to
safer areas, including to military and police stations, Antara
added.
</P>
<P>
It was the third riot to hit Poso since January this year. The
city is vulnerable to sectarian riots, as residents living in the
northern area clashed many times with those in the south.

<HEADLINE> SADC yet to Decide on Boycott of Lome Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The Southern Africa Development
Community (SADC) is yet to decide whether or not to boycott the
summit of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), if it takes
place in the Togolese capital of Lome.
</P>
<P>
This was reported by the daily paper "Noticias" on Tuesday,
which cited a source in the Mozambican Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Angola, a SADC member country, has called for a SADC boycott,
unless the venue is changed.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that the Togolese government was cited in a
United Nations report as being among the supporters of the rebel
National Union for Total Independence of Angola (Unita) in
violation of sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
The summit is scheduled for mid-July. Theres is thus still time
to switch it to another city, possibly to Addis Ababa, where the
OAU is headquartered. Angola said that the OAU should respect the
U.N.-imposed sanctions, and punish Togo for violating them.
</P>
<P>
According to Belmiro Malate, director of the Mozambican Foreign
Ministry' s department for economic relations, the issue is still
"on the negotiating table", and SADC has not yet taken any
decision.
</P>
<P>
He said it is still "untimely to make any analysis, because
this is an issue still under debate and the conclusion will be
made public in due course".
</P>
<P>
Some SADC sources said that the organization is still
consulting with other regional groupings before taking any
decision, so as to avoid a possible split within the OAU.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Angolan Foreign Minister Joao Miranda came to Maputo
as part of his tour of SADC to try and persuade the member
countries to boycott the Lome summit.
</P>
<P>
He said, then, that Togolese President Gnassimbe Eyadema "is in
no moral condition" to lead the OAU, because of his cooperation
with Unita.

<HEADLINE> Russian Military: Key Chechen Warlord Killed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev said Tuesday that Russian elite troops killed Abu
Movsayev, one of well-known Chechen rebel field commander, in a
recent special operation.
</P>
<P>
"The federal units have carried out several special operations
to eliminate rebel formations over the past two days. In a direct
clash, they killed ten rebels, including infamous rebel field
commander Abu Movsayev," Sergeyev told reporters in the
Belarussian capital of Minsk, where he arrived Tuesday to attend a
summit of the Customs Union of the Commonwealth of Independent
States.
</P>
<P>
"This information needs to be confirmed by documents," he said,
adding that there are only two things the rebel leaders can do: "
stop resistance and surrender, or die."
</P>
<P>
Early Tuesday, acting Russian presidential aide Sergei
Yastrzhembsky told the press in Moscow that Movsayev's body has
been found in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Movsayev, 41, a key ally of Aslan Maskhadov who is the
president of the breakaway republic of Chechnya, and another
Chechen rebel field commander Shamil Basyaev participated in a
world-shaking raid on the town of Budyonnovsk in Russia's
Stavropol territory in June 1995.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, he was appointed as head of the Security Department of
the alleged Chechen Republic of Ichkeria. Since October 1998, he
has served as chief of the Chechen military commandant's special
department.
</P>
<P>
Monday, Kremlin aide Yastrzhembsky denied media reports that
the most prominent Chechen field commander Basayev had died of
gangrene a few days ago at a rebel base in the mountains of south
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
"The reports of the death of Basayev are a canard, and I cannot
confirm it," he told a news conference in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Basayev was wounded in the leg when his groups broke out of
Chechen capital Grozny in February and the injury developed into
gangrene later. Several successive amputations were performed on
his leg.
</P>
<P>
However, it seems doctors have failed to halt the process,
which gives reason to believe that Basayev has probably died of a
deadly infection.
</P>
<P>
Chechnya's separatist government also refuted the reports of
Basayev's death, quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying that
Basayev did contract gangrene in the leg after it was partially
amputated and had another operation, but his condition is now "
satisfactory."

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The presence of the world's
leading tyre makers including Michelin, Bridgestone, and Goodyear
has made Liaoning the nation's top tyre production base.
</P>
<P>
Before the Shenyang Tire Factory joined Michelin in France in
1995, it was on the brink of bankruptcy. In 1998 and 1999,
however, the joint venture exported tyres valued at 22.65 million
US dollars and 27 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Liaoning produces almost all of the world's namebrand tyres
today," local residents said.
</P>
<P>
The Shenyang Tyre Factory today boasts an annual tyre
production capacity of 4.78 million units.
</P>
<P>
More investment is expected to flow into Liaoning with the
initial success achieved by these top tyre makers. Michelin in
France, for instance, set up three more joint ventures in Shenyang
in 1997.

<HEADLINE> China Combats Fake Plugs, Sockets, Switches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Three leading Chinese electric
appliance makers have been waging large-scale promotion activities
for their new brand-name commodities throughout the country's
major cities.
</P>
<P>
The promotions are conducted by TCL International Electric
Appliances, Qisheng and Songben, three famous companies that
manufacture quality plugs, sockets and switches. The activities
are designed to curb fake and shoddy plugs, sockets and switches
on the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
Wen Shanglin, General Manager of TCL International Electric
Appliances, believed that promoting brand-name commodities may
help to curb fake and shoddy products on the market.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that annual sales of plugs, sockets and
switches are around six billion yuan. High-grade commodities only
make up one billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
An official with the State Technical Quality Control Bureau
said the big profits in the plugs, sockets and switches business
is an important factor behind the reason that many businessmen may
break the laws and regulations and engaged in the making fake and
shoddy products.
</P>
<P>
Some of these products are made from low-quality materials.
However, there are quite a number of these products are made by
smaller and poorly-equipped businesses according to orders placed
by big companies which later repackage the products by pasting
their own corporate labels.
</P>
<P>
China now has 1,500 businesses engaged in making plugs, sockets
and switches, but only one third of them have been given permits
to produce these products.
</P>
<P>
Fake and shoddy plugs, sockets and switches are blamed for
causing about 80 percent of fire across the country.

business system, according to the CDB's Governor Chen Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Global Internet Financial Services Conference
which opened here today, Chen said that the bank has drafted a
three-year plan for the construction of a computerized bank.
</P>
<P>
He said that the CDB has successfully developed the "enterprise-
bank system," being promoted as a foundation to Bank's e-banking
business. The accounting system has already started operation,
the enterprise payment system and office automation system are
being implemented, while credit risk management, basic database
and off-site auditing systems are being built and will be finished
this year.
</P>
<P>
To date the headquarters of the CDB and its 28 branches have
all built computer rooms and structured cabling, with 800 PCs at
the head office and 1,200 PCs at its branches to meet on-line
banking demands.
</P>
<P>
He said the CDB has developed a "counter forward" system in
which the CDB will install a terminal at the borrower's site to
connect the bank's own system. The borrower can process project
loan applications, payment, temporary borrowing, financial and
project reports and also access information.
</P>
<P>
The successful operation of the system will not only improve
the quality of financial services, but can also save 1.156 billion
yuan for the CDB and 48 million yuan for borrowers annually.
</P>
<P>
He said that with the assistance of advanced electronic
technology, the CDB aims to become a modern wholesale bank which
will satisfy the needs of the market economy, encourage financial
innovations and operate in accordance with international standards.

<P>
BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- China's bamboo industry is playing
an increasingly important role in China's economy, with its annual
output value exceeding 17 billion yuan, according to figures from
the State Forestry Administration.

Bamboo products are now popular in a wide range of sectors
including architecture, paper-making, food, furniture, package,
transportation, medicine and tourism.

<HEADLINE> NPT Review Conference: Success in General, FM Spokeswoman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue said here today at a press conference that
China regards the recently-concluded Review Conference of the
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) as a success in general.
</P>
<P>
"The conference on the whole is a successful one which ended in
passing the final document by discussion and consensus, and making
arrangements for nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament
efforts in the next five years, which will exert positive impacts
on further reviewing and implementing the NPT, as well as on
promoting the non-proliferation and disarmament process," she said.
</P>
<P>
China welcomes the final document passed by the conference,
although the document failed to comprehensively reflect the
reality of the current world situation and to make positive
efforts in urging the solution of some fundamental problems
undermining international strategic balance and stability and
obstructing the process of nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear
disarmament, she pointed out.
</P>
<P>
She made the pledge that China will continue to honor its
commitments and obligations according to the Treaty, and to make
efforts in promoting nuclear non-proliferation, nuclear
disarmament, as well as the peacefully utilization of nuclear
power.

<HEADLINE> China Launches Emergency Sand-Harnessing Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Compelled by the frequent sandstorms
that have blown across north China, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region initiated an emergency project to tackle the sandbank
endangering the Chinese capital of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
According to the project worked out by the central government,
the autonomous region in north China will try to improve the
environment in three key areas to reduce possibility of sandstorms.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the project is expected to harness 1.2
million hectares of sand in three years. The central government
will pay 100 yuan (12 U.S. dollars) per mu (15 mu = one hectare)
of land to be enclosed from grazing in order to protect grassland.
</P>
<P>
The three projected areas, occupying 48.2 million hectares with
some 10 million population, are close to Beijing and its
neighboring municipality of Tianjin. A sandlot in the areas is
moving towards Beijing at an annual pace of 1.8 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile 10 seed bases will be established in the autonomous
region.
</P>
<P>
This spring, at least 11 sandstorms have swept through the
autonomous region, which used to be prairie stretching across the
horizon. Beijing alone has been hit by nine sandstorms during the
season.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that China's sandstorm damage results in
economic loss of 54 billion yuan (6.5 billion U.S. dollars) each
year.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Draws Plan for Peace With Greece in Aegean Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Former Turkish Naval Forces Commander
Guven Erkaya has drawn up a four-page action plan for Prime
Minister Bulent Ecevit aimed at realizing peace in the Aegean Sea
and bolstering Turkish-Greek relations, local press reported
Tuesday. Erkaya, one of the prime minister's chief advisers,
said Turkey should solve its problems with Greece by 2004 in the
course of its European Union accession process.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and its neighboring Greece have long been locked in
disputes over the Aegean Sea and Cyprus. But relations between the
two countries have improved since last year when they rushed to the
aid of each other following massive earthquakes in both countries.
</P>
<P>
According to the peace plan, Turkey might consider abolishing
its 100,000-strong Aegean Army as a goodwill gesture to contribute
to the continuation of the rapprochement between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Turkish officials said, however, that it would be difficult to
implement the step if the Greek side did not take concrete measures
on disarmament of the Aegean islands, recognition of a six-mile
territorial waters limit and solution of continental shelf without
resorting to the International Court of Justice.
</P>
<P>
Ankara established the Aegean Army as the country's fourth army
on May 20, 1975 after it sent troops to Cyprus in 1974 to quench a
coup in Nicosia seeking union with Greece. The army's first and
second commanders, Turgut Sunalp and Kenan Evren, later became
Turkish presidents.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it was reported that Athens had agreed to discuss the
disputes between the two sides through bilateral negotiations,
backing away from its previous position on taking the disputes to
the International Court of Justice.
</P>
<P>
But officials from the Turkish Foreign Ministry said they have
not received such proposals from the Greek side, which they said
would help improve bilateral relations.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian PM to Persuade Transport Minister to Stay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said Tuesday he would try and persuade Ling Liong
Sik, the transport minister who announced his decision to quit
from the cabinet Monday, to reconsider his decision.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir told reporters after opening the Third Asia-Africa
Forum here that he had not received any official letter of
resignation from Ling who is the president of the Malaysian
Chinese Association (MCA) the largest Chinese-based party in
Malaysia, and the MCA president could still attend the weekly
cabinet meeting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said he would ask the MCA chief to
reconsider but it was up to Ling.
</P>
<P>
To a question on whether there will a cabinet reshuffle if Ling
sticks to his decision, Mahathir said: "No, I will just fill up
that post because the ministry is an important one."
</P>
<P>
However, he said that he would need to do some adjustment
because the post had to be filled by an experienced person.
</P>
<P>
To another question on whether the Transport Ministry post
would stay with the MCA or be given to other parties, Mahathir
said it was not a permanent post for the MCA.
</P>
<P>
He said there is a need to make an assessment as to who is
suitable to hold the post. This is because the post is an
important one as there are big plans to further upgrade the
transport industry.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that he would first study the recommendation by
Ling that MCA vice-president Chan Kong Choy take over the
Transport Minister's post.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that the MCA will not be given any additional
post in the cabinet so as not to upset other Barisan Nasional (BN)
(National Front) component parties.
</P>
<P>
The MCA, the second largest BN component party, reportedly
asked for an additional cabinet post prior to the surprise move by
its president Ling Liong Sik Monday to announced his decision to
resign as Transport Minister, a post he has held for 14 years.
</P>
<P>
Ling announced his decision during the party's presidential
meeting here and later said he would not change his mind. But he
did not give the reasons for his resigning from the cabinet except
saying "my turn to go has come."

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Philippine stocks were still lower
Tuesday as investors continued to unload key stocks wary that the
civil unrest may persist in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
The 33-share composite index shed 7.42 points to close at 1,404.
67. The broader all-share index also dropped by 3.95 points to 593.
93.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said a number of issues, such as the Mindanao crisis,
the bomb scare in Metro Manila, the higher interest rates, and the
weak corporate results n the first quarter, prompted investors to
avoid the equities market.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Long Distance Telephone was Tuesday's most actively
traded issue. The New York-listed telecom firm ended higher.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts feared the political and civil unrest, coupled
with expectations of higher budget deficit this year could
continue to weigh down the composite index of the Philippine Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, the Philippine peso broke the resistance level
of 42 pesos to one U.S. dollar and averaged 42.048 pesos against
the green back. It was weaker compared to Monday's close of 41.915
pesos against the dollar.

<HEADLINE> 167 Burundian Hutu Combatants Arrested in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Police in Tanzania's western
Kigoma Region have arrested a total of 167 Burundian combatants of
Hutu origin who fled from three refugee camps.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian newspaper quoted the Kigoma Regional Police
Commander Placid Chaka as saying on Tuesday that the 167 Burundian
refugees were arrested by police at Makere village in Kibondo
District last Thursday midnight.
</P>
<P>
All the combatants residing in Kibondo, who were travelling in
two vehicles, claimed they were going to Burundi to join their
colleagues in the National Council for Defense of Democracy-Forces
for Defense Force (CNDD-FDD), a major rebel group in the Burundian
civil conflict.
</P>
<P>
During interrogations, the combatants, including 24 children
whose ages ranging from 13 to 18 years, said they intended to
cross the Burundi- Tanzania border so that they could attend
military training being offered by CNDD-FDD in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
However, according to the regional police commander, neither
firearms nor uniforms or any type of weapon were found on the
Burundian combatants.
</P>
<P>
The regional police commander said Jamal Msafiri, whose father
is a Tanzanian and mother a Burundian and who had been living with
his mother in Burundi before fleeing to Tanzania, recruited the
combatants and hired the two vehicles.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the refugees were brought before the Kigoma Regional
Court to face a charge of unlawfully deserting refugee camps. They
are remanded in custody at Ilagala prison. The case will come up
for mention on June 5.
</P>
<P>
Chaka has warned all Burundian refugees to refrain from
preaching military politics in refugee camps.
</P>
<P>
He said Tanzanian Police Force will not hesitate to take stern
measures against any refugee found spreading military politics
inside the camps.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Past War Against China Was Aggressive: Mori </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori
said Monday that Japan's 1937-1945 war against China was an act of
aggression.
</P>
<P>
"From a stance to reflect on the past unfortunate history, I
clearly acknowledge that the past war against China was an
aggressive war," Mori told a session of the Settlement
Administrative Supervisory Committee of the House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
Mori's remarks, made in response to a question from an
opposition lawmaker asking whether Japan's past war against China
was an aggressive war, revised his early vague explanation on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
Mori said on April 24 that views on war depend on different
historic backgrounds, and whether Japan launched an aggressive war
against China in the past should be judged by people in the
process of history.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Continue Falling in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices continued falling in
Tokyo Tuesday due to weakness in high-priced information and
technology issues, with the two key stock price indexes rewriting
new closing lows for the year.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost 67.28 points, or 0.41
percent from Monday's close to end at 16,318.73, hitting this
year's closing low for the third straight trading day.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, dropped 2.65 points or 0.17 percent to 1,519.
84.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section edged up to 614.58 million shares
from Monday's 609.64 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Nippon Steel was the day's volume leader.
</P>
<P>
Individual investors have become reluctant to actively buy
stocks after seeing recent declines in information and technology
issues, a dealer said.
</P>
<P>
The recent sluggish stance by foreign investors, the major
driving force in the Tokyo stock market, was another factor urging
domestic investors to sell stocks, the dealer said.
</P>
<P>
High-priced information and technology issues were damaged by
weakness on Wall Street, where both the Dow Jones Industrial
Average and the Nasdaq composite index closed lower Monday.
</P>
<P>
Losers included brokerages, wholesalers and drugmakers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, electric power and gas firms, oil distributors and
rubber makers enjoyed large gains.
</P>
<P>
Of the issues listed on the First Section, gainers outpaced
losers 710 to 541 despite the falls in the Nikkei and TOPIX, with
132 issues closing unchanged.

BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua)-- Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman
Zhang Qiyue said at a regular press conference here today that
China supports the Cambodian government and people in making

</P>
<P>
In response to a question concerning Cambodia's strong
displeasure over the pressure and interference imposed by some

is the internal affairs of Cambodia, and the international

independence of Cambodia, instead of imposing the will of an
individual country on the Cambodia government and people."
</P>
<P>
"We support the legitimate demands of the Cambodian government,

The pressing task facing Cambodia, Zhang added, is to continue

concentrate its efforts on economic development, and improve the
living standards of its people.
</P>
<P>
Any attempt to trigger national conflicts in Cambodia again
runs against the fundamental interests of the Cambodian people,

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Israeli newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) is preparing for a speedier
withdrawal from the security zone in south Lebanon following what
appears to be a breakdown of its ally, the South Lebanon Army
(SLA).
</P>
<P>
Israel's security cabinet was still meeting urgently on the
matter late Monday night, but in view of Monday's developments,
with the collapse of SLA's Shiite brigade and the nearly unopposed
takeover of villages in the central sector of the security zone by
the Hezbollah, the likelihood of a rapid withdrawal increased.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said that
Israel's response to any attack on its citizens and soldiers after
the IDF withdrawal "will be very painful and will not necessarily
take place in the villages of the security zone."
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Long lines of cars streamed south from Kiryat Shemona Monday,
as thousands of northern Israelis close to leave the northern city
rather than spend a night in bomb shelters and security rooms,
given what they perceived as a deteriorating security situation.
</P>
<P>
During early afternoon hours, the IDF ordered the residents of
northern towns to enter the bomb shelters following the
announcement that two Lebanese civilians were killed by IDF tank
fire.
</P>
<P>
Scours of Kiryat Shemona residents have reportedly put their
homes up for sale and many families have delayed registering their
children for kindergarten and first grade, apparently because they
are unsure they will still be living there in the coming September.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Just a week after the government approved the handover of Abu
Dis and two other villages just outside Jerusalem to full
Palestinian control, the municipal planning committee Monday
approved plans to build a new Jewish housing project on privately
owned Jewish land in Abu Dis.
</P>
<P>
The project still needs to win approval from the district
planning committee and then needs to be authorized by the interior
minister.
</P>
<P>
The new neighborhood of some 200 homes is to be called Kidmat
Zion and is slated to be built on 70 dunams (about seven hectares)
in the part of Abu Dis which falls within Jerusalem's city limits.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- In a breakthrough in the impasse between Shas and Meretz,
Shas acknowledged Monday that they know of Finance Ministry and
Education Ministry plans to establish an orderly system to transfer
additional funds to the religious party's education system.
</P>
<P>
Shas officials were summoned to a meeting Monday night to review
the revised agreement. According to it, Shas will receive some 20
million shekels (about 5 million U.S. dollars) for their education
system.
</P>
<P>
Some future disagreements are likely, as Shas considers the gap
between the proposal they will be offered and the 51 million
shekels (about 12.75 million dollars) they have requested.

<HEADLINE> Barak Says Withdrawal from Lebanon to End within Days </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
said on Tuesday that Israel would complete its accelerated troop
withdrawal from south Lebanon within a few days.
</P>
<P>
"We will redeploy in the next few days on the international
border," Barak told the army radio, hours after his security
cabinet empowered him to speed up a pullout from Israel's
occupation zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"The Lebanon tragedy is over," Barak added.
</P>
<P>
Around 120 Israeli troops pulled out from the Bint Jubeil
outpost in the so-called security zone in south Lebanon and
returned to Israel overnight.
</P>
<P>
They were the first batch of Israeli troops who officially quit
south Lebanon entirely along with their equipment, ahead of the
target date of July 7 for a full Israeli withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
The pullout marked the beginning of the large-scale withdrawal
from south Lebanon, due to the collapse of the pro-Israeli militia
South Lebanese Army (SLA) and the advance of Lebanese Hezbollah
guerrillas to snatch up the outposts, turned over by Israeli troops
to the SLA but abandoned by them almost immediately.

<HEADLINE> 75 Percent of Israeli Occupation Forces out of Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Three quarters of the Israeli
occupation troops have withdrawn from south Lebanon and the
remaining quarter is expected to leave within this week, Voice of
Lebanon radio reported Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The larger part of south Lebanon has been freed, including the
border towns of Bint Jebeil and Sweida, both of which were vacated
by Israeli troops overnight, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
The main Israeli concentrations are now in the Beaufort Castle
and the town of Marjeyoun in the eastern sector of south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The radio also reported that about 80 pro-Israeli South Lebanon
Army militiamen surrendered to Lebanese authorities overnight.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah guerrillas Tuesday morning captured the Christian
village of Ain Lbil after Israel and the SLA abandoned it. The
village was the first Christian village in south Lebanon to be
taken by the Muslim guerrillas in two days of advances deep into
the territory previously held by Israel and the SLA.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Encourages Hi-Tech Electronic Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is encouraging high-
tech electronic products for which attractive incentives are being
offered to promote investments and reinvestments in technology and
capital intensive projects.
</P>
<P>
In a seminar on "Business Opportunities in Malaysia" held
Monday in Portland, capital of the U.S.'s Oregon state,
International Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz said that
Malaysia offers investment opportunities in information technology
(IT and multimedia sectors with the development of the Multimedia
Super Corridor (MSC).
</P>
<P>
The minister, who is in the U.S. from May 18-25 at the head of
an investment mission, encouraged IT and software companies in
Oregon to explore investment opportunities in the MSC in sectors
such as in software &AMP; content development, internet-based business,
systems integration, telecommunications and networking business,
education and training, according to Bernama News Agency on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Rafidah said Malaysia is promoting the continued
diversification of its industrial base towards high-end and
integrated manufacturing as well as development of the value-added
sector.
</P>
<P>
As by April 25, 2000, 323 companies were approved with MSC
status, of which 134 are with foreign majority holdings.
</P>
<P>
Total bilateral trade between Malaysia and the United States
stood at 7.2 billion U.S. dollars during the January-March period
this year against 29.9 billion dollars for the whole of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is Malaysia's largest trading partner, accounting for
19.9 percent of its global trade of 150 billion dollars last year.

<HEADLINE> Indian Navy on 72-Hour Alert for Jaffna Evacuation: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At a meeting of the Indian Cabinet Committee on Security on
Monday, the Indian armed forces conveyed the assessment that the
hold of the Sri Lankan forces over Jaffna town is precarious and
it could fall to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in
the coming days, the Hindustan Times quoted "highly-placed sources
" as saying.
</P>
<P>
If Jaffna falls to the Tamil rebels, there are three possible
ways of evacuation for the nearly 30,000 Sri Lankan troops trapped
in the peninsula: the first is that the LTTE could allow the
troops to withdraw to Palaly airbase for aerial evacuation; the
second is that the LTTE could give a safe passage to the trapped
troops; and the third and most possible way is that the Sri Lankan
government would ask India to assist in the evacuation, said the
Hindustan Times report.
</P>
<P>
Indian defense officials feel that the first two ways of
evacuation are just a "remote possibility" given the trust levels
of the LTTE, said the report.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the newspaper said, the Indian navy has been
placed on an alert notice in case Sri Lanka makes a formal request
in this regard.
</P>
<P>
However, the newspaper also noted that quite a few Indian
defense officials feel Jaffna might not fall after the Sri Lankan
forces changed battlefield tactics last week.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Bangalore in south India last week, Sri
Lankan Chief of Defense Staff General Rohan De'Silva Daluvatte had
a meeting with top Indian military officials, during which the
Indian side briefed the Sri Lankan general and his team on LTTE
tactics, intelligence, battlefield leadership and guerrilla
warfare, the Hindustan Times again quoted "highly-placed
government sources" as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Indian side suggested the beleaguered Sri Lankan troops try
to change the ground situation in the Jaffna peninsula by adopting
various offensive or defensive strategies, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Other major national newspapers, such as the Hindu, the Indian
Express and the Times of India, carried reports similar to that of
the Hindustan Times. However, there was no government announcement
or confirmation about the Indian navy being placed on alert on
Tuesday, while the semi-official Press Trust of India also
remained silent on this issue.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Thailand, S'pore Joint War Game Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PATTANI, Thailand, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The armed forces of
Thailand, Singapore and the United States ended the Cobra Gold
2000 joint military exercise here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At the closing ceremony, U.S. Ambassador to Thailand Richard E.
Hecklinger described the exercise as "innovative and invaluable,"
adding that the skills trained during the exercise can be used to
deal with real-world contingencies.
</P>
<P>
For the first time, this year's exercise, the 19th of the Cobra
Gold series, focused on peacekeeping and peace enforcement
operations and conducted a joint noncombatant evacuation operation
(NEO).
</P>
<P>
The organizer said the NEO helped focus the training toward
possible contingencies other than major theater war, and make the
exercise more "realistic."
</P>
<P>
It addresses a more likely contingency and adds a crisis action
planning dimension for the staff to deal with.
</P>
<P>
Cobra Gold 2000 is one of the largest exercises involving U.S.
forces in the Pacific region this year. About 13,000 U.S. army,
marine, air and other forces participated in the operation.
</P>
<P>
The number of Thai and Singaporean participants are 7,100 and
29, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Singapore was invited for the first time to take part in the
exercise, which has been carried out annually by the United States
and Thailand for the last 18 years.
</P>
<P>
Australia, Malaysia and the Philippines also sent observers to
this exercise.
</P>
<P>
A senior U.S. marine officer said at the press conference after
the closing ceremony that this exercise is "open" to all countries
in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. can't afford doing bilateral military exercise
with all countries, and multilateral exercise is more efficient.
</P>
<P>
Before the closing ceremony, the U.S. and Thai marines
conducted a beach landing operation in Pattani, about 750
kilometers south of Bangkok.

<HEADLINE> Australia Threatens to Sanction Fiji if Chaudrey Toppled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Australia Tuesday warned of tough
diplomatic and economic sanctions against Fiji if gunman George
Speight succeeded in his push to topple Fiji's government.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Alexander Downer made it clear that Australia
would not accept any compromise on the hostage crisis which does
not protect the democratically elected government.
</P>
<P>
"We are outraged at what has happened," Downer said, adding
that Australia would help build international support to try to
urge Fiji to maintain its democratic system.
</P>
<P>
"I think that if Fiji abandons the path of democracy and
abandons its constitution in an unconstitutional way, this will be
a disaster for Fiji's engagement with the international community,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
"All Fijians will suffer unless there is a return to
constitutional government," Downer noted.
</P>
<P>
However, Downer played down the possibility of Australian
military intervention to support the government of Prime Minister
Mahendra Chaudhry, who is being held hostage by Speight in Fiji's
parliament.
</P>
<P>
"I can't see that there's any value of Australia getting
somehow militarily involved," Downer told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Fiji's Great Council of Chiefs began meeting Tuesday to try to
find an end to the four-day-old hostage crisis in Fiji.
</P>
<P>
Fiji's President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara has not ruled out
replacing Chaudhry with another prime minister to break the
impasse.
</P>
<P>
The country's Education Minister Pratap Chand, the most senior
member of Fiji's government to meet Downer since the attempted
coup, said he was encouraged by Australia's continuing support for
the constitutional government.
</P>
<P>
He said he had not sought any practical assistance from
Australia at this stage.
</P>
<P>
"He (Downer) has been in touch with the president and he is
continuing to see how best Australia can assist in any way that
would resolve the crisis in Fiji," Chand told reporters after the
meeting.

<HEADLINE> Uganda, Rwanda to Pull Troops out of Kisangani, Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Uganda and Rwanda will withdraw
their troops on Thursday from Kisangani, a northeast city of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Ugandan Army spokesman
John Kaitirima told Xinhua on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We have finally agreed to move our armies out of Kisangani in
our directions, and our two nations and armies have made a strong
commitment not to clash again," said Kaitirima.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan and Rwandan troops fought each other last August and
this May in Kisangani, the third largest city of the DRC, where
they have their armies stationed to back rival rebel factions
fighting against the DRC President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
The troops withdrawal from the city is scheduled to end on June
10, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kaitirima said that both the Uganda People's Defence
Forces and the Rwanda Patriotic Army have started to reduce their
troops from the command border areas.
</P>
<P>
"The reduction of troops at the border areas is nearly
completed," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and his Rwandan counterpart
Paul Kagame agreed in their recent summit to demilitarize the
Kisangani city and reduce the amassing troops at the order to the
minimum.

<HEADLINE> IATA Calls for Better Air Traffic Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The unreasonable air traffic
controls around the world will cause huge damage on airlines this
year, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) said here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The IATA estimated that flights will experience over 27 million
minutes of delay in the year. At the same time, the cost of delays
will bring the estimated total cost to airlines and passengers to
over 8 billion euros.
</P>
<P>
Pierre J. Jeanniot, director general of the IATA, said that
many air traffic control centers are expected to cause delays,
including Marseilles, Padua Rheims, Geneva, Karlsruhe, Zurich,
Maastricht and the Prague. London will still face significant
delays even though it is forecast to achieve better-than-target
values.
</P>
<P>
Jeanniot said that governments must ensure that capacity is
ahead of traffic, instead of consistently lagging behind demand.
</P>
<P>
Traffic flow forecasts are published well in advance and
capacity planning is agreed yearly, but many countries do not
implement the plans, which make passengers and airlines suffer
delays, Jeanniot added.
</P>
<P>
"The solutions are clear and possible - for the sake of the
consumer, let's make it happen," he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmer Makes Fortune by Planting Trees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, May 23 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese farmer living in a
village in northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region has
become a millionaire by planting trees and growing medicinal herbs.
</P>
<P>
Shi Pinfa, a villager in Guyuan, one of the poorest counties in
China, has made more than one million yuan (125,000 US dollars) by
selling saplings and herbs in the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Twenty years ago, Shi tried planting some Beijing poplar in his
3 mu (0.2 hectare) of land, earning 5,000 yuan (602 dollars) by
the year's end. In the following seven years, he made more money
by expanding the planting area and increasing the variety of trees.
</P>
<P>
In 1989, Shi planted 100,000 Chinese pines in all his 36 mu (2.
4 hectares) of land after he found them both easy to grow and
lucrative way to make money.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, he leased some land from his neighbor to grow
medicinal herbs, and soon struck it rich.
</P>
<P>
Shi is concerned with the environment in his village, where
excessive logging has made a nearby hill barren. He has a plan to
plant trees on the hill and make it green again.

<P>
BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The Red Flag Publishing House is
soon to publish a book on China's top leader Jiang Zemin's
instruction on the Communist Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
In his recent study tour of south China's Guangdong Province,
Jiang emphasized that the CPC always earnestly represents the
development requirements of China's advanced social productive
forces, the progressive course of China's advanced culture, and
the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the
Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Entitled "The Aim for Establishing the Party, the Foundation
for Governing the Country, and the Source of Power -- A Study on
Comrade Jiang Zemin's Important Instruction on the Party," the
book has hailed Jiang's above instruction as inheritance and new
development of Marxist theory on Party building, a scientific
summary of the 80-year old CPC and a great guiding principle for
Party building in the new century.
</P>
<P>
Editors from "Seeking Truth," a leading theoretical magazine in
China, have worked on the book, together with experts from central
departments of the CPC.

<HEADLINE> Israel Begins Troops Withdrawal From South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Israeli troops left
south Lebanon under the cover of darkness early Tuesday morning
amid reports that Israel will end its 22-year occupation of south
Lebanon within days.
</P>
<P>
Security sources in Lebanon said the predawn withdrawal involved
some three-quarters of the Israeli forces in the security zone in
south Lebanon, which Israel set up in 1985 with a self-claimed
purpose of protecting its northern security.
</P>
<P>
The Israel Defense Force (IDF) cleared the Bint Jubeil outpost,
the second largest outpost in the zone, and around 120 IDF officers
and soldiers have withdrawn to Israel overnight, an army statement
said.
</P>
<P>
It added the withdrawal was orderly. "The IDF redeployed in the
security zone in line with the new situation in the sector."
</P>
<P>
Reports from the Israeli-Lebanese border said that convoys of
the IDF soldiers drove out of Lebanon at daybreak Tuesday in tanks
and jeeps.
</P>
<P>
The move followed an emergency Israeli cabinet meeting Monday
night at the Defense Ministry in Tel Aviv empowering Barak to speed
up the pullout.
</P>
<P>
This was in view of the faster-than-expected collapse of the
pro-Israeli militia South Lebanon Army and the advance of Lebanese
Hezbollah guerrillas to snatch up the outposts, turned over by
Israeli troops to the militiamen but abandoned by them almost
immediately.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah guerrillas and Lebanese villagers have reclaimed about
one 10th of the Israeli self-styled buffer zone in south Lebanon
within days, which could bring Israeli occupation to a quicker end.
</P>
<P>
The army radio quoted high-ranking army officers as saying the
pullout from south Lebanon would be over within the next few days.

<P>
MANILA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Philippine manufacturing production,

<HEADLINE> Manila Attributes Peso Decline to Global Trend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Tuesday that the drop in the value of the peso vis-a-vis the U.S.
dollar reflects the global trend sweeping international markets as
a result of steps taken by the U.S. Federal Reserve to hike
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Rafael Buenaventura, governor of the Central Bank of the
Philippines, said in a radio interview that currencies worldwide,
including the British pound and the Swiss franc, dropped in
reaction to the Federal Reserve's move.
</P>
<P>
He said that the ongoing conflict in Mindanao in the southern
Philippines may have had a slight effect on the peso but stressed
that this was not the key factor for the slide.
</P>
<P>
"Other countries are also adjusting their interest rates and
this is also what we have been doing. Unfortunately, this
development was accompanied by bad news on the peace and order
situation in Mindanao," Buenaventura said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that since December 31, 1999, when the United States
bared plans to hike interest rates, the peso has slid by 3.72
percent vis-a-vis the .S. dollar, while the Singapore dollar
dropped by 3.52 percent and the Thai baht by 3.82 percent.
</P>
<P>
Even the relatively strong Euro sunk by 10.6 percent,
Buenaventura added, with the Swiss franc and the British pound
dropping by 7.7 percent and 8 percent, respectively. The Japanese
yen also slid by 4.12 percent.
</P>
<P>
The central bank governor expressed confidence that given the
economy's strong fundamentals, the peso, which fell to 41.92
against the dollar on Monday, would normalize soon.
</P>
<P>
Buenaventura also noted that the country's gross international
reserves remain at a record-high of 16 billion U.S. dollars, which
he expects would be maintained with the entry of new investments.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Political Conditions to Dhaka-EU Accord Raise Concern in Bangladesh  By Pan Xiaozhu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Economists and politicians from both
the government and the opposition in Bangladesh voiced concern
over the political conditions attached to the new cooperation
agreement between the country and the European Union (EU) signed
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The new agreement was signed in Brussels to replace the
Bangladesh-EU commercial cooperation agreement signed in 1976.
</P>
<P>
According to an EC press release published here Tuesday, unlike
the past one, the new agreement is comprehensive and has strong
political elements as the guiding force behind it.
</P>
<P>
The new agreement has made development assistance and conduct
of trade conditional on good governance, human rights and other
issues.
</P>
<P>
In a seminar organized here by the Center for Policy Dialogue (
CPD) on the eve of the signing of the new agreement, all
participants rejected political conditions in the agreement,
saying that it would infringe on the nation's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the seminar titled "Bangladesh-EU Development
Partnership: Emerging Challenges in the Context of Globalization,"
economists and politicians of the country stressed that political
interference should not come under the cover of cooperation
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Former diplomat Waliur Rahman suggested that there should not
be any interference in Bangladesh's domestic developments in the
name of human rights protection.
</P>
<P>
His view was shared by senior official of the Foreign Ministry
Anwar Hashim, who said the donor countries should not link human
rights and labor issues with trade and investment matters.
</P>
<P>
Presenting a paper on Bangladesh-EU Development Relationship,
Mustafizur Rahman, research director of CPD, pointed out that a
major departure of the new cooperation agreement is that many new
issues have been brought "within the ambit of bilateral
development relationship."
</P>
<P>
These include such diverse issues as compliance with the trade-
related intellectual property rights, labor rights, human rights
and governance, he said, adding that "the experience of the least
developed countries over the past years has been that such issues
have often been used to support protectionist measures aimed at
denying market access."
</P>
<P>
Rejecting conditions and interference in the country's
political system and pointing to donors' conditions, former
Finance Minister Saifur Rahman said he was once an ardent believer
in globalization but the way it had so far moved "had only proved
painful for the developing nations."
</P>
<P>
EU share in total grants received by Bangladesh during last
five years had come down from 37.7 percent in 1993-94 to 28.7
percent in 1998-99. Foreign aid to the country now only accounts
for 2 percent of the country's fiscal deficits.
</P>
<P>
Economists here are in favor of establishing trade relations
instead of aid relations with the donor countries, particularly
with the EU nations, since the country has turned out to be a
development partner from primarily an aid-recipient country.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Capital Faces Severe Water, Power Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Residents in Kenya's capital
Nairobi will have to experience a major water and power crisis as
a water dam faces imminent closure due to the prolonged drought.
</P>
<P>
The East African Standard Tuesday quoted city water officials
as saying that the level of water in the Sasumua Dam has
dramatically gone down as the catchment basins continued to suffer
from the longest drought in over five years.
</P>
<P>
Acting General Manager of the City Water and Sewage Department
J.P. Kimani said that city councillors will have a tour of the dam
Tuesday to assess the situation.
</P>
<P>
Due to falling water levels in hydro-electric dams caused by
the failure of the rain seasons, Kenya Power and Lighting Company
announced Monday that power rationing will worsen from six hours a
day for three days a week to 12 to 18 hours a day for four days a
week from next week.
</P>
<P>
The Meteorological Department Director Evans Mukolwe has warned
that the current drought might be most severe in the past 16
years.
</P>
<P>
The power rationing, which started last September, and water
shortage have hampered the industry sector and brought
difficulties to daily lives of ordinary people in the east
African country.

<P>
NAIROBI, May 23 (Xinhua) -- More than 20 percent of the
students aged between 15 and 19 are HIV-positive in the east
African country of Kenya, according to new statistics by the
Education Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's Daily Nation quoted Education Minister Kalonzo
Musyoka as saying that the disease threatens to wipe out all the
gains made in education since independence.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, so many teachers are dying of AIDS that many schools
will become under staffed, Musyoka said.
</P>
<P>
However, he was not able to give the number of teachers
suffering from the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
The minister called for concerted efforts to promote AIDS
awareness in schools to reverse the trend.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, the Teachers Service Commission instructed
head teachers to submit a list of HIV-positive teachers, but
received stiff resistance and was forced to withdraw the order.
</P>
<P>
About two million people in the country are currently infected
with the killer virus with two thirds of them aged under 25.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Seeks 200 Million U.S. Dollars to Fight HIV/AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Uganda is seeking 300 billion
shillings (200 million U.S. dollars) to fight against HIV/AIDS for
the next five years, said a senior Ugandan official on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Uganda needs this sum of money to cover the HIV/AIDS awareness
campaign and education program, and in HIV/AIDS prevention, care,
service provision and planning," David Kihumuro Apuuli, director
general of Uganda AIDS Commission (UAC), told Xinhua in a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
Apuuli expressed the hope that various countries including the
United States, China and Japan would fund Uganda's campaign
against HIV/AIDS in the 2000-2005 period.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 20 million Ugandans, nearly two million people are
infected with AIDS/HIV while 1.8 million have died of the
pandemic, according to Apuuli.
</P>
<P>
Uganda currently has about 1.7 million orphans whose parents
died of AIDS, he added.
</P>
<P>
The national AIDS prevalence rate was as high as over 30
percent in late 1980s and early 1990s. Up to date the rate has
dropped to 10 percent due to the government's increasing efforts
against the disease and great enhancement of people's awareness in
this regard.  Uganda is one of a few African
countries where AIDS prevalence rate is dropping, and it aims to
reduce the rate from the current 10 percent to 7.5 percent by the
year 2005.

<HEADLINE> Intel Plans Shipping One Billion Flash Memory Chips By 2002 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Intel Corp., the world's
largest chip maker, said Monday it had sold one billion flash
memory chips since 1988 and expected to sell another billion over
the next two years.
</P>
<P>
Flash memory, used in cell phones, set-top boxes and other
appliances for storing data and applications, has emerged as one
of the fastest growing semiconductor markets in recent years.
Analysts said that flash revenue for the industry as a whole grew
from 2 billion U.S. dollars in 1998 to 4.5 billion dollars in 1999
and to a projected 10 billion dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
Intel has an estimated 25 percent share of the market of flash
chips. At a press conference at Santa Clara, California, the
company's headquarters, Intel executives said they were planning
to increase the manufacturing of the devices amid a booming market
for flash memory used in wireless devices.
</P>
<P>
Intel said it plans to produce four times as many flash
megabytes in 2001 as in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources say that Intel rival Advanced Micro Devices
Inc. is the second-largest maker of flash memory chips, with about
15 percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
Intel plans to invest more than 2 billion dollars over the next
few years into flash memory and expand its product lines in an
effort to capitalize on the exploding demand for the flash memory
chips, the company said.

CANBERRA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Japanese judo star Ryoko Tamura,
bidding for an Olympic gold medal at this summer's Sydney Games,
said Tuesday in Sydney she has set her sights on defending her
world title next year and at the 2004 Olympics in Athens as well.
</P>
<P>
"I think I'll try my best to compete in the next Olympics (in
Athens) again. Thinking this is the last one makes me less

The 24-year-old Tamura has stayed in Sydney for one week after
being named to the Japanese Olympic team following her 10th

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Shenzhen, in south China's
Guangdong Province, has set a goal of reaching economic
development standards in developed countries by 2030.
</P>
<P>
The target was suggested by Zhang Gaoli, secretary of Shenzhen
City Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), in a report
delivered at the city's third CPC congress opened yesterday.
</P>
<P>
According to Gao, Shenzhen will achieve an annual growth rate
of ten percent in its gross domestic product (GDP) in the next
five years.
</P>
<P>
By 2005, the city's GDP will reach 280 billion yuan ( about 33.
7 billion U.S. dollars), while added value from the service trade
will contribute 53 percent to the city's GDP. High-tech
commodities will make up a half of the city's total industrial
output value.
</P>
<P>
Disposable income for residents will be 35,000 yuan (about 4,
216 U.S. dollars), per capita living space will be 18 sq m, and
the average mortality rate will be 77 years of age.
</P>
<P>
The party secretary said that greater efforts should be made to
improve the socialist market, attract more overseas investment,
improve economic cooperation with Hong Kong and Taiwan, and
promote the development of high-tech industries.
</P>
<P>
The reform and opening-up of the past two decades has turned
Shenzhen into a prosperous modern city. Last year, the per capita
disposable income of urban residents exceeded 20,000 yuan (2,409 U.
S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
More than 20 billion U.S. dollars has been invested in the city.
Exports make up one seventh of the country's total.

<HEADLINE> Project Launched to Improve Ecology Along Yellow River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- A project has been launched in the
Qumalai County in northwest China's Qinghai Province, at the
source of the Yellow River, costing 13 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to radically change ecological
conditions of the source of the Yellow River, and put a stop to
serious soil erosion in the area.
</P>
<P>
Spanning two years, the project will include adopting a logging
ban to increase vegetation coverage areas and improve the
grassland eco-system by controlling pests such as mice as well as
planting grass on the more than 1,000 hectares of land.
</P>
<P>
Located at the Qingzang Plateau, the county is known for its
adverse climate and fragile ecology. Almost half of the county is
desert, with 35 percent of grassland exposed to mice and other
pests.

<HEADLINE> China Merges Intermediate Businesses(2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China now has 35 kinds of specialized intermediate agents. In
contrast, there are only two major categories of intermediate
agents in the west, namely lawyer offices and certified accountant
offices.
</P>
<P>
Xiang said that the intermediate agents are so specialized in
certain areas that they are no match for international consulting
companies in terms of business diversity and services.
</P>
<P>
Vice Minister of Finance Zhang Youcai blamed this state of
affairs on excessive government intervention in business sectors.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in the past, various government departments have
used their administrative power to set different standards and
regulations for specific intermediate agents. By creating and
controlling a specific category of intermediate business, they
obtained their own sphere of influence in the market.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the past, most government departments have set
up one or more intermediate agent companies to turn administrative
power into economic returns.
</P>
<P>
The central government has decided by the end of the year, all
these intermediate companies have to be independent of their
government protectors in terms of personnel, finance, business and
titles. All intermediate companies such as accountant offices
will become independent and self-governed.
</P>
<P>
Xiang said that this is a major step forward by the government
to stop intervention in companies. He said that the intermediate
agent sector will develop independently. The power and authority
of professional associations will also be greatly expanded.

<HEADLINE> On-Line Banking Enjoys Great Prospects in China (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Governor of CDB Chen Yuan said that as China makes significant
progress in WTO membership negotiations, full-scale competition
from foreign banks are also imminent. China's banks face both
encouraging opportunities and tough challenges.
</P>
<P>
"On-line banking is a critical part of e-commerce," he said. "
The financial sector plays a pivotal role in the Chinese economy,
therefore, it is also in a best position to impose an impact on
the process and level of e-commerce application in other sectors.
Banks should become the most active participants and promoters of
e-commerce."
</P>
<P>
He said that China's banks have placed increasingly greater
emphasis on the construction of electronic banking and most major
commercial banks have recently opened on-line banking services.
</P>
<P>
However, China's on-line banking business is still at a primary
stage, he said, adding that existing on-line services are
basically the extension of traditional businesses, while banks
still lack new services that can coexist with the Internet. As a
result, China's banking industry should draw on the experiences of
developed countries in e-commerce development.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jing, director of payment and IT department of the People'
s Bank of China, said that the central bank has played an
important role in the country's development of e-commerce. Since
the beginning of 1998, the Bank has worked out a number of tasks,
including establishing a financial certification center, a study
group on the role of the central bank in e-commerce and a liaison
and study group on e-commerce in the financial industry.
</P>
<P>
He said that the central bank plans to establish a financial
certification policy management committee, build financial
certification management, set up a study group on on-line banking,
establish guidelines on on-line banking licensing and supervision
procedures, a study group on on-line payment and solve problems on
the on-line payment system.

BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- China has merged the administration
of three major intermediate businesses to provide fair competition
for both Chinese and foreign practitioners, said Minister of
Finance Xiang Huaicheng today.
</P>
<P>
He said that the former China Association of Certified Assets
Appraisal Agents, the China Association of Certified Taxation
Agents and China Association of Certified Accountants have already
merged and are under the supervision of the China Association of
Certified Accountants.
</P>
<P>
The merger will affect 300,000 professional and tens of
thousands of agent companies around China.
</P>
<P>
The merge followed China's successful attempt to merge auditing
services with the certified accountant sector. China is also
planning to reshuffle appraisal services and legal services.
</P>
<P>
Xiang said that the Ministry of Finance will release a report
on the future development of intermediate companies in China by
the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
These move is aimed to develop an intermediate service sector
that is in line with international practices, and is objective and
fair.

BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and overseas experts
attending the Global Internet Financial Services Conference opened
here today said that China's on-line banking business is facing
great development opportunities and has enormous potential.
</P>
<P>
The conference, jointly sponsored by the China Development Bank
(CDB) and the United States' Lehman Brothers, attracted nearly 100
Chinese and overseas financial and IT experts. They discussed the
global on-line banking developments, present and future prospects
of on-line banking businesses in China, and exchanged views on
various related issues.
</P>
<P>
Jarett Wait, chief executive officer of Lehman Brothers Asia,
said that China has been a pioneer in the Asian on-line financial
services sector and has made great progress in this area. China
is in a unique position to accelerate its economic growth by
continuing to embrace the Internet and the technology revolution.
</P>
<P>
He said that China can benefit from the experience of the U.S.
and Europe, as well as benefit from examining the developments in
the marketplaces of some Asian neighbors such as Japan and the
Republic of Korea. Internet users in China have exceeded 10
million, providing a potentially huge market for on-line financial
services.
</P>
<P>
"By 2003, there will be over one million users of on-line
brokerage services in China, accounting for over five percent of
the total trading volume with an annual growth rate of over 230
percent," he said.

<HEADLINE> Pollutants Found on Mount Everest: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Scientists have found
pollution on Mount Everest, the world's highest mountain peak.
</P>
<P>
According to a comprehensive survey on Qinghai-Tibet Plateau,
samples of ice and snow, water, soil and living things collected
from the Everest and Himalayas in 1990s were reported to contain
various kinds of pollutants.
</P>
<P>
Scientists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) obtained
the first group of such samples from the top of Everest to the
northern slope 4,300 meter above sea level and southwest slope 2,
300 meter above sea level in 1975, which indicated a basically
uncontaminated environment.
</P>
<P>
Following expeditions were made by Chinese scientists in 1980
and in 1990s. They found that the oil field burning during the
Gulf War in 1990-1991 contaminated Mount Everest and its northern
slope.
</P>
<P>
Scientists also found that the ice cubes collected from 7,100
meter above sea level on Qinghai-Tibet Plateau recorded oil
burning as well.
</P>
<P>
The ice cubes contains more than 120 types of organic compounds.
</P>
<P>
This is the largest number of such compound scientists have
ever found in a mountain ice cube, which shows that pollution
caused by humans has even reached areas as remote as mountains on
the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

<HEADLINE> 507 Kg Smuggled Ivory Seized in Shenzhen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Custom officials have seized over
500 kilograms of African ivory in China's southern city of
Shenzhen, which borders Hong Kong, according to the Beijing-based
"Legal Daily".
</P>
<P>
This is the first ivory-smuggling case ever exposed in
Shenzhen, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The ivory was discovered on May 16, when officials from the
Tongle Custom, attached to the Shenzhen Custom, carried out a
routine check on an expressway linking Guangzhou, capital city of
Guangdong province, and Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
During the check, the officials found a truck from Shenzhen
carrying ten containers of goods that resembled white columns,
which turned out to be African ivory.
</P>
<P>
The ivory, totaling 507 kilograms, were cut into pieces
measuring about one meter in length, with the thickest one
measuring 20 centi-meters in diameter.
</P>
<P>
"Legal Daily" didn't specify where the ivory came from and
what the local authorities would do with it.
</P>
<P>
The ivory has been passed on to police for further
investigation, together with two suspected smugglers, one of whom
is from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
As China has signed a treaty to protect rare animals, ivory
smuggling is a crime in China, who forbids ivory trade of any kind.

BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists will carry out a
ten-year monitoring project to keep a close eye on Mount Everest's
environment and its environs.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the project will benefit research on global
environmental changes and provide studies for environmental
protection in the development of China's western regions.
</P>
<P>
Like North Pole and South Pole, Mount Everest is regarded as
one of the most uncontaminated areas in the world. But in recent
years, the Himalayas has also become polluted.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) made environmental
surveys in the area in 1975, 1980, 1992, 1994, 1995 and 1997, but
no long-term monitoring project has ever been launched.
</P>
<P>
According to sources from CAS, scientists will build an
autonomous monitoring system, fly sky exploring balloons, and
collect environment samples, as well as water and meteorological
material.
</P>
<P>
They will also provide reports on the environment in the
Himalayas and the ozone hole above the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau each
year.
</P>
<P>
Before "International Environment Day" on June 5th, scientists
will set off for Mount Everest and its neighboring areas to
conduct environmental surveys.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Soldiers Begin Pullout from South Lebanon: Army </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSELAM, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Israeli soldiers pulled out from
an outpost in the so-called security zone in south Lebanon and
returned to Israel overnight, the army confirmed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This seemed to be the beginning of a large-scale Israeli
withdrawal from south Lebanon where they had occupied for 22 years,
ahead of the deadline of July 7 set by Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
The Israel Defense Force (IDF) cleared the Bint Jubeil outpost,
the second largest outpost in the zone and around 120 IDF officers
and soldiers have withdrawn to Israel, an army statement said.
</P>
<P>
It added the withdrawal was orderly. "The IDF redeployed in the
security zone in line with the new situation in the sector."
</P>
<P>
The move followed an emergency Israeli cabinet meeting Monday
night at the Defense Ministry in Tel Aviv empowering Barak to speed
up the pullout.
</P>
<P>
This was in view of the faster-than-expected collapse of the
pro-Israeli militia South Lebanon Army and the advance of Lebanese
Hezbollah guerrillas to snatch up the outposts, turned over by
Israeli troops to the militiamen but abandoned by them almost
immediately.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah guerrillas and Lebanese villagers have reclaimed about
one 10th of the Israeli self-styled buffer zone in south Lebanon
within days, which could bring Israeli occupation to a quicker end.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the Israeli-Lebanese border said that convoys of
Israeli soldiers drove out of Lebanon at daybreak Tuesday in tanks
and jeeps.
</P>
<P>
The army radio quoted high-ranking army officers as saying the
pullout from south Lebanon would be over within next few days.

<HEADLINE> Nepal GDP Grows 3.4 Percent in 1999: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 23 (Xinhua) -- In the resurgence of Asian and
the Pacific economies which recorded a GDP growth of 5.6 percent
in 1999, Nepal saw a moderate growth of 3.4 percent in the same
year, according to a survey.
</P>
<P>
The 3.4 percent GDP growth from 2.6 percent the previous year
was due primarily to recovery in the agricultural sector, said the
Economic and Social Survey of Asia and the Pacific-2000, available
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The agriculture sector grew by 2.4 percent and non-
agricultural sector by about 4.0 percent in 1999," said the survey,
which was prepared by the Economic and Social Commission for Asia
and the Pacific of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Nepal's official economic data are expected to be released in
June this year.
</P>
<P>
As a proportion of GDP, gross domestic savings rose by one
percentage point to 10.6 percent in 1999 while investment fell
noticeably for the fourth consecutive year to 17.3 percent, the
survey said.
</P>
<P>
Inflation saw a downturn in 1999, with the consumer price index
in urban areas going down to 9.6 percent from over 10 percent the
previous year, it said.
</P>
<P>
Although Nepal's trade deficit stood high in 1999, it was
bridged by surplus in services transactions, notably tourism
receipts and the transfer account, including overseas assistance
and workers' inward remittances.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, "the foreign exchange reserves increased
considerably to 1.1 billion U.S. dollars (11 months of import
cover) in 1999, from 700 million U.S. dollars (seven months of
import cover) in the previous year," it said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment in Nepal came primarily from China, India,
Japan and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The survey predicted that the aggregate output is expected to
remain on an upward trend, rising by 4.0 percent in 2000, as a
result of further improvement in agricultural production, an
upturn in exports and higher foreign investments.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Appointment of New CEC Ends Speculation, Confrontation Remains  By Chen Jian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Nominated by Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina, M.A. Syed, chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, was appointed Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) by
President Shahabuddin Ahmed Monday, ending the fortnight-long
speculation over the key post which had been left vacant for two
weeks since former CEC Mohammad Abu Hena resigned on May 8 for
health reasons.
</P>
<P>
But it does not end the bitter confrontation between the ruling
party and the opposition alliance. A few hours after the
appointment, the four-party opposition alliance led by the
Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) unanimously rejected the "
unilateral" appointment of the new CEC, saying it ignored the
opinions of all political parties.
</P>
<P>
BNP Secretary General Abdul Mannan said that it once again
proved the government was never sincere in discussion regarding
the appointment of a new CEC acceptable to all parties.
</P>
<P>
To protest against the appointment, the four-party alliance
will stage demonstrations in Dhaka Tuesday and across the country
on May 24, and a protest rally will also be held in Dhaka Tuesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The government, however, has hailed new CEC M.A. Syed as an "
honest, efficient and hardworking" person, competent to conduct
national elections fairly.
</P>
<P>
"I believe the controversy over the CEC will now end and the
new CEC will be acceptable to all who believe in democratic and
constitutional rule," Principal Secretary to the prime minister
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the appointment, Prime Minister Hasina had written two
letters to the Leader of the Opposition, Khaleda Zia, inviting her
to hold talks over the appointment. But Khaleda insisted on
talking to the president, saying he was the appointing authority.
</P>
<P>
The effort to initiate a dialogue between the government and
the opposition went bust after the BNP chairperson on May 14 told
a public meeting that the CEC would be appointed in consultation
with the political parties only after Hasina resigns and hands
over power to a caretaker government.
</P>
<P>
The man at the center of the controversy, Syed, put a brave
face on his appointment. In an interview with the official
Bangladesh News Agency, when asked if he considered the job of the
CEC risky, Syed promptly replied that somebody would have to take
risk.
</P>
<P>
Describing the task of the CEC as "most important," Syed said
that after assuming the office of the CEC, he would talk to all
parties and undertake reforms to further modernize the activities
of the Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he would resign from the post once the opposition
demands his resignation, Syed said he had no dispute with the
opposition, and expressed his confidence that he would be able to
earn the trust of the Leader of the Opposition, as he had the
experience of working with Khaleda Zia as her home secretary.
</P>
<P>
Syed identified lack of transparency as the biggest problem in
ensuring free and fair elections, saying transparency must be
everywhere in the Election Commission, political parties and all
other related agencies involved in the election process.
</P>
<P>
While Syed showed much confidence in his acceptability and was
termed as a "senior, honest and dedicated officer" by the
government, the political problem centering on the Election
Commission would persist and the new appointment would escalate
the existing political confrontation in the country, since the
appointment was not done on the basis of a consensus, observers
here said.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President Criticises Officials on Kisangani Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
criticised officials of his country and Rwanda, saying they are
making inflammatory comments about the Kisangani issue, the New
Vision daily reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Museveni said that both sides had shown a lack of restraint in
their statements, and these officials had no right to inflame the
situation with their statements.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan and Rwandan troops went into clashes on May 5 and 8 in
Kisangani, the third largest city in the Democratic Republic of
the Congo (DRC), where they have their armies stationed to support
rival rebel factions fighting against the DRC President Laurent
Kabila.
</P>
<P>
"These officials are making chauvinistic statements instead of
seeking restraint," the president was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The problem in Kisangani originally starts with different
methods of business, but even so there was no need for this
shooting," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The objective interests of the two countries dictate that we
must resolve these issues amicably. Even if there is a
fundamental difference on how to handle matters in the DRC, the
way to resolve it is not by violence," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Museveni and his Rwandan counterpart Paul Kagame agreed to
demilitarize the Kisangani in a recent summit. Chiefs of their
armies have also reached a consensus that both sides will withdraw
their troops 100 kilometers outside of the city center.

<HEADLINE> Lakers Lose At Home, First In Playoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Los Angeles Lakers Monday
night was beaten by the Portland Trail Blazers 106-77, losing at
home for the first time in eight playoff games and the second time
in 26 games since losing to the Blazers on Jan. 22. Los Angeles is
43-6 at home.
</P>
<P>
Rasheed Wallace, on his best behavior after being ejected from
Game 1 for getting two technical fouls, had playoff career-highs
of 29 points and 12 rebounds Monday night for the Blazers, which
evened the best-of-seven Western Conference finals 1-1.
</P>
<P>
Wallace had 11 points and five rebounds in the third quarter,
when the Blazers outscored Los Angeles 28-8, tying the Lakers'
playoff low for that quarter and just two short of the NBA-record
low set by Atlanta against Boston on May 6, 1986.
</P>
<P>
Scottie Pippen had 21 points and 11 rebounds for Portland. He
scored 17 points in the first half as the Blazers took a tenuous
48-45 lead. Steve Smith scored 24 for the Blazers, who are 3-3
against Los Angeles this season and the only team to win twice on
the Lakers' court.
</P>
<P>
Shaquille O'Neal, averaging 30.8 points in the playoffs, had 23
points and 12 rebounds, but 14 of his points came in the fourth
quarter, when the Lakers never got closer than 18.
</P>
<P>
Kobe Bryant was the only other Los Angeles player in double
figures with 12 points, but was only 2-for-9 from the field.
</P>
<P>
The Lakers made just two of 15 shots in the third quarter and
were outrebounded 14-5, even though O'Neal played the entire 12
minutes.
</P>
<P>
Game 3 is scheduled Friday in Portland.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that winner of the Western Conference finals
will be almost certain the NBA champions this year, no matter
which team comes out from the Eastern Conference finals.

<HEADLINE> Toshiba Against Chinese Consumer Rights Law (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Referring to the no-address policy
of Japanese electronic giant Toshiba toward its laptop computer
glitch, a consumer rights official has said that Toshiba has
violated Chinese law by depriving consumers of their rights.
</P>
<P>
Dong Jingsheng, deputy secretary-general of the government-
sponsored China Consumers Association, was quoted as saying in
today's "China Youth Daily".
</P>
<P>
In a press briefing held here Monday, Toshiba reiterated that
it refuses to compensate Chinese customers who have purchased its
laptops if they malfunction.
</P>
<P>
Defects are common to all Toshiba notebooks manufactured before
November. The major problem is data loss.
</P>
<P>
According to Chinese law, Toshiba must notify all Chinese users
in Chinese language about its computer glitch, the official with
the CCA said.
</P>
<P>
"But it didn't, nor did it post such messages on its webpages
until the Chinese media reported the matter," he said, stressing
that by doing so, "the electronic giant obviously broke the
Chinese law."
</P>
<P>
"The China Consumers Right Association is going to resolutely
protect the rights and interests of consumers and will keep a
close eye on the development of the Toshiba issue," he said.
</P>
<P>
Toshiba said that they would not compensate Chinese users as
they had in the US because China does not have as stringent
consumer protection laws as the United States.

<P>
Toshiba's vice-president Masaichi Koga, who just arrived in
Beijing Monday to deal with the problem, told reporters that its
glitch will not cause any loss of data under normal use.
</P>
<P>
The problems could possibly lead to data loss under some
extreme conditions when a laptop is overloaded, but the "chances
of this happening are slim," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked if it was fair to compensate US consumers but not Chinese
customers, Koga replied that under US laws Toshiba was obligated
to compensate its American customers one billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
"But in other parts of the world, including China and Japan, we
need not pay anything in compensation for damage potential," said
Koga. He insisted that Toshiba did not lose its US case, saying
the compensation was just an amicable settlement.
</P>
<P>
Koga said that Toshiba will do everything to help its Chinese
laptop purchasers except providing compensation.
</P>
<P>
Toshiba has sold more than 15 million laptop computers
worldwide, and not one customer has had data loss problem, he said.
</P>
<P>
A Beijing-based news website, 21DNN, broke the Toshiba story on
May 8, and the news soon spread nationwide via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese media has been covering the Toshiba story for the
past two weeks against the company's "discrimination" against
Chinese consumers.

<HEADLINE> China Develops New Field Stretcher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- China has developed a kind of multi-
functional field stretcher that can be used by the army, air force
and navy.
</P>
<P>
Different from the traditional ones, these stretchers can be
used as an operating table, a sledge, a hovercraft, a one-man
trailer or a trunk in field conditions.
</P>
<P>
The stretcher was designed by Chen Donggang, a dentist from No.
222 Hospital of the Shenyang Military Area Command.
</P>
<P>
The stretcher is equipped with wheels and could be pulled by
one man. Traditional stretchers are usually manned by two people.
</P>
<P>
Chen said it could be also unfolded to become an operation
table when necessary and can float on water when filled with gas.
It can also be hung vertically under a helicopter when carrying
the wounded.
</P>
<P>
The General Logistics Department of the People's Liberation
Army has applied the stretcher on a trial basis by military
command troops in Shenyang, Chengdu and Lanzhou.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Cancer Element Produced in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have produced a
kind of chemical element through artificial synthesize which can
fight tumor cells.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time in the world the element has been produced
through artificial synthesize since foreign scientists discovered
the anti-cancer function of saponin, which is separated from a
South African plant.
</P>
<P>
Saponin is much more stronger than the other medicines
currently used to treat cancer, according to Yu Biao, a research
professor with the Shanghai Research Institute of Organic
Chemistry under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
</P>
<P>
Since saponin needs large amount of raw material and
complicated methods to abstract it from natural plants, scientists
have decided to produce it through artificial synthesize.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, under the guidance of Hui Yongzheng and Yu Biao,
Doctor Deng Shaojiang and other researchers at the institute began
experiments on producing such element and succeeded to produce
more than 20 milligrams of saponin.
</P>
<P>
"Over the past few years, our research group has discovered
methods which can be used to abstract element similar to saponin,"
said Prof. Yu.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists are now trying to improve the molecular
structure of saponin to raise its ability in treating cancer.
American scientists are now using samples provided by Chinese
scientists in anti-cancer research.

<HEADLINE> Israel Soldiers Pull Out from South Lebanon Outpost: Army  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSELAM, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Israeli soldiers pulled out from
an outpost in the so-called security zone in south Lebanon and
returned to Israel overnight, the army confirmed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
They were the first batch of troops who quit south Lebanon
entirely along with their equipment, ahead of the target date of
July 7 for a full Israeli withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
The Israel Defense Force (IDF) cleared the Bint Jubeil outpost
and around 120 IDF officers and soldiers have withdrawn to Israel,
an army statement said.
</P>
<P>
It added the withdrawal was orderly. "The IDF redeployed in the
security zone in line with the new situation in the sector."
</P>
<P>
The move followed an emergency Israeli cabinet meeting Monday
night at the Defense Ministry in Tel Aviv empowering Prime Minister
Ehud Barak to speed up the pullout.
</P>
<P>
This was in view of the faster-the-expected collapse of the pro-
Israeli militia South Lebanon Army and the advance of Lebanese
Hzebollah guerrillas to snatch up the outposts, turned over by
Israeli troops to the militiamen but abandoned by them almost
immediately.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah guerrillas and Lebanese villagers have reclaimed about
one 10th of the Israeli self-styled buffer zone in south Lebanon
within days, which could bring the 22-year Israeli occupation to a
quicker end.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Signs New Cooperation Agreement With EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- A new cooperation agreement was
signed between Bangladesh and European Union (EU) in Brussels
Monday to intensify decades-old relations between the European
Commission and Bangladesh, The Daily Star newspaper reported here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Commerce Minister Abdul Jalil, who now leads a 3-member
delegation in the Belgian capital, signed the accord on behalf of
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
"This agreement will give new impetus to our relations with
Bangladesh, including our political dialogue and marks a maturity
in our relationship," said Commissioner for External Relations
Chris Patten who signed the agreement on behalf of the European
Commission.
</P>
<P>
The objectives are more comprehensive than those in the old
agreement, and are in line with the EU's policy, Patten said,
adding that the new agreement now includes a "human rights clause"
as a reflection of the importance both the EU and Bangladesh
attach to the issue.
</P>
<P>
EC Commissioner for External Development and Humanitarian Aid
Poul Nielson said the agreement, covering both economic and
development cooperation, will strengthen the partnership to work
for lifting millions of people out of poverty over the coming
years.
</P>
<P>
The EU accounts for 45 percent and 10 percent of Bangladesh's
exports and imports respectively. Bangladesh is the second largest
EU aid recipient in Asia and is on top of the EC's global list of
food aid recipients.
</P>
<P>
EC Ambassador to Bangladesh Antonio de Souza Menezes said in
Dhaka Monday that he hoped the new agreement will take the EU-
Bangladesh relations considerably beyond the limited objectives of
commercial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In the coming months, Menezes said, he will be engaged with the
government of Bangladesh in a series of contacts to identify
priorities under the new treaty.

<HEADLINE> Li Ruihuan Ends Successful Four-nation Trip of America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), concluded his four-nation trip of America with
"complete success," CPPCC secretary-general Zheng Wantong said
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The official goodwill visit, from May 8 to 21, was the first
ever by a CPPCC National Committee chairman to Canada, Venezuela,
Trinidad and Tobago and Peru, said Zheng, who accompanied Li
during the trip.
</P>
<P>
"As one of the most important visits made by top Chinese
leaders so far this year, the trip attained its goal of improving
mutual understanding, enhancing friendship, expanding common
ground and promoting cooperation. The trip ended with complete
success," Zheng told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Zheng said that the four governments had paid great attention
to Li Ruihuan's visit.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Li held talks with leaders of the four
countries on bilateral ties and other issues of common interest,
including ways to promote exchange and cooperation on trade,
culture, science and technology.
</P>
<P>
On China's reform and economic growth, Li told leaders of the
host countries that all achievements made in the past 20-odd years
are attributable to the principle of emancipating minds and
respecting realities. Leaders of the four countries highly praised
the success of China's economic reform, according to Zheng.
</P>
<P>
During his trip, Li elaborated on many important occasions
China's peaceful foreign policies. He pointed out that the Chinese
people cherish and long for peace because they have suffered a lot
in the last 100 years during which many wars broke out. China
needs peace for its development and wants to establish and develop
friendly cooperative ties with all countries in the world on the
basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence.
</P>
<P>
During talks with leaders of the four countries, Li said China
advocates that all countries, big or small, rich or poor, strong

their differences in the social system, cultural traditions or
values. They should respect each other, treat each other equally,
and get on well with each other, and seek common ground on major
issues while reserving differences on minor ones.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC chairman also pointed out that China attaches great
importance to maintaining wide contacts with people of other
countries, their leaders in particular. "We stick to seeking
common ground and reserve differences and strengthening our common
understanding during our contacts. We maintain that we should seek
mutual benefit and cooperation, learn from each other to make up
for deficiencies, and advance side by side. We hope we will have
more friends, the more the better," Zheng quoted Li as saying.
</P>
<P>
Through Li's elaboration, the leaders of the four countries
have further understood China's peaceful foreign policies, Zheng
said. They all expressed on separate occasions that they are
willing to develop friendly cooperative relations with China.
</P>
<P>
During his visits to the four countries, Li also introduced
China's system of cooperation among the multiple parties under the
leadership of the Communist Party of China and the status,
functions and role of the CPPCC, according to Zheng.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Opposition Parties to Submit No-confidence Motion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Japan's four opposition parties
agreed Tuesday to jointly submit a no-confidence motion against
Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori's cabinet over Mori's recent
controversial remarks that Japan is a divine nation with the
emperor at its center.
</P>
<P>
Secretaries general of the four parties -- the Democratic Party
of Japan (DPJ), the Japanese Communist Party (JCP), the Liberal
Party (LP) and the Social Democratic Party (SDP) -- agreed to
cooperate on the motion during a meeting earlier in the day,
officials of the parties said. They will meet in the early
afternoon to discuss the issue further.
</P>
<P>
Mori has been under fire for the "divine nation" remarks he
made on May 15. The remarks are for many a disturbing echo of
Japan's militarist past, when Japanese troops invaded Asian
countries in the name of the emperor.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties said Mori's remarks also run counter to the
separation of politics and religion as enshrined in Japan's
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Public disapproval rating for Mori's cabinet jumped above 54
percent in May after his remarks, surveys published Tuesday by two
leading Japanese newspapers showed.

SHANGHAI, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The American XEROX company will
produce state-of-the-art digital copying machines in China by the
latter half of next year, according to Carlos Pascal, XEROX's
deputy executive president.
</P>
<P>
XEROX is among the earliest multinational corporations to
invest in China since the country opened to the outside world in
the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
The company has opened joint-ventures in Shanghai, Suzhou and
Wuhan, and a solely-funded enterprise in Shenzhen. Its products
have since dominated the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
However, it later began to lose market shares for technology
and customer services reasons.
</P>
<P>
XEROX now is adjusting its development strategy by expanding
capital investment and strengthening technological research in a
bid to give customers a better product.
</P>
<P>
Expecting to face fiercer competition after China enters the
World Trade Organization (WTO), XEROX plans to build its sixth
research and development center in China, Pascal said.

Arab Emirates under the arrangement of the country's Labor
Department and the Overseas Employment Company, the New Light of

BUCHAREST, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Romania decided to draft an
afforestation program for the next five decades, enlarging its
forest coverage of two million hectares, the Ministry of Water,
Forestry and Environmental Protection announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
A ranking official from the ministry said Monday, "It's a grand
program. It means at least 40,000 hectares of trees will be
planted in the wasteland and land with poor soil per year."
</P>
<P>
The government is preparing to set up a national afforestation
committee that will consist of meteorological and forestry experts,
which will work out a national strategy for improving depleted
land by September, He said.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, a fourth of all the land in Romania
is rapidly deteriorating and experts suggest the best way to
change the situation is to plant trees.
</P>
<P>
Romania's current forest coverage rate is 27 percent, but it
has been declining recently because of deforestation.

<HEADLINE> Annan Sends Envoy to Assess Situation in Fiji </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 22 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, concerned about Fiji rebels' resort to unconstitutional and
violent actions indented to bring about a change of government,
urged Monday the release of the hostages and the restoration of
democratic rule in the Oceanic country.
</P>
<P>
He decided to designate Sergio Vieira de Mello as his Special
Envoy for Fiji, and asked him to proceed to visit Fiji as soon as
possible, Annan's spokesman said in a press statement Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Vieira de Mello, currently Annan's Special Representative for
East Timor, will assess the situation in Fiji and express Annan's
concerns to the government and leaders of political parties there,
the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Annan's spokesperson Marie Okabe confirmed that Vieira de Mello
will leave Tuesday, without giving further details of his visit.
</P>
<P>
Rebel gunmen led by Fiji businessman George Speight stormed the
parliament Friday, announcing that they had seized power.
</P>
<P>
The rebels have since held cabinet members led by Prime Minster
Mahendra Chaudhry as hostages and the situation at the parliament
house has become increasingly tense, according to reports from
Fiji.
</P>
<P>
Speight declared himself the country's interim prime minister
after being sworn in Saturday. But on Monday he said he will "
retire" if the country's tribal chiefs do not support his attempt
to seize power.
</P>
<P>
The gesture was seen by political analysts as a signal of
Speight's weakening resolve to take control of the country and his
intention to consider a way out of the situation.

<HEADLINE> Le Jingyi's Olympic Hope in Vapor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JI'NAN, May 23 (Xinhua) -- To be a third-time Olympian was a
dream for Chinese swimmer Le Jingyi, but now her hope of making a
berth in the national squad was scorched by her poor performance
at the national selection meet.
</P>
<P>
After a two-year lay-off, Le competed for the first time in Ji'
Nan, the last chance for Chinese swimmers to qualify for the
Sydney Olympic Games and showed a rusty 50 meters freestyle with
26.08 seconds.
</P>
<P>
"I am upset that I loss my chance to meet the Olympic standard
and complete my dream of being a third-time Olympic swimmer," said
the disappointed Le, who placed a distant sixth while her younger
teammate Xu Yanwei took the crown in 25.64
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old Le, 100m freestyle gold medalist in Atlanta and
a member of 4X100m freestyle runner-up in Barcelona, had plagued
by hepatitis in 1998 and resumed training just for three months.
</P>
<P>
"I am always confident about myself, but this time I have to
say I am not ready enough for the Olympic trial," she said.
</P>
<P>
Le, former world record holder in the women's 50m and 100m
freestyle, blamed hepatitis for obstructing her third Olympic ride.
Le spent two months in the United States, said her technical form
was coming back, but not her strength.
</P>
<P>
"If I was fully prepared I would have qualified for the Sydney
Games. However, I am glad I tried my best to make my dream come
true."
</P>
<P>
Le said she will probably quit the sport, but remain the
possibility to compete the ninth National Games next year as soon
as her hometown team Shanghai calls for her.

<HEADLINE> Local Lawmakers Trained for Legislation Law (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- China's National People's Congress
(NPC) opened its second training program here Monday to promote
the faithful implementation of the Legislation Law which will take
effect on July 1 this year,
</P>
<P>
The program is designated for local officials in charge of
legislative affairs in provinces, regions, and major cities.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Chunyun, vice-chairman of the NPC Standing Committee,
told those attending the program that the new law is significant
to regulate lawmaking activities, and to ensure that laws are of
the people and the unity of China's legal system be maintained.
</P>
<P>
Since 1978, which marked the beginning of China's reform and
opening up, the top legislature has promulgated 375 laws, in
addition to formulating the nation's fourth Constitution in 1982
and amending it three times.
</P>
<P>
With another 800 administrative regulations formulated by the
State Council and more than 7,000 local legislative items, a legal
framework with Chinese characteristics has come into being over
the years.
</P>
<P>
Jiang told the local officials that "there are still many
problems such as contradictions between different laws and
regulations, and irresponsible law-making out of considerations
for local interests."  more

<TEXT>
<P>
"These problems not only undermine the integrity and dignity of
laws and regulations enacted but also give rise to disputes in law
enforcement," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The legislation law provides basic principles in law-making,
detailed stipulations on the limits of authority of laws and
regulations, the process of legislation and applicable rules.
</P>
<P>
To solve conflicts and confusion arising from conflicting laws
and regulations, the law also establishes special procedures for
examining laws and regulations to be drafted, and the NPC Standing
Committee is authorized to repeal any regulations that contradict
the Constitution and related laws.
</P>
<P>
According to the law, local legislation must never contravene
the Constitution and the national laws.
</P>
<P>
Jiang asked local officials to study the new law carefully and
relate it to their own legislative work, in a bid to check
specific problems and improve their quality of legislation.
</P>
<P>
The training program was orchestrated by the Legislative
Affairs Commission of the NPC Standing Committee, and attended by
120 persons with provincial and municipal legislatures and
governments across the country.
</P>
<P>
The first five-day training program was concluded on May 15.

<HEADLINE> Inspection on Rural Enterprise Law Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The Standing Committee of China's
National People's Congress (NPC) has concluded inspection tours to
provinces on enforcement of the law on rural enterprises starting
from May 8 to 22.
</P>
<P>
According to today's People's Daily, the inspection teams,
headed by Buhe, vice-chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, had
been to the provinces of Henan, Shaanxi, Zhejiang, Jiangxi,
Shandong, Liaoning, Hunan, and Chongqing Municipality over the
past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Standing Committee also asked the standing committees of
provincial people's congresses of Jiangsu, Sichuan, Gansu and
Yunnan to carry out the same inspections and report to it.
</P>
<P>
Rural enterprises mainly involve those collectively-owned
enterprises in the countryside that enjoy some preferential tax
policies. They are also responsible for supporting local
agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
The law, effective on January 1, 1997, was made to support the
growth of rural enterprises and regulate their operation,
</P>
<P>
Officials and experts say that healthy development of rural
enterprises is needed for the smooth operation of the national
economy.
</P>
<P>
The inspection focused on how the local authorities implement
the law, regulate operation of the rural enterprises and protect
the legitimate rights of the enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that in 1999, there were 20.71 million rural
enterprises across the country with 127 million employees. The
rural enterprises produced an added value of 2488.3 billion yuan
and paid 179 billion yuan in taxes.
</P>
<P>
However, some problems have emerged during the development of
rural enterprises. For instance, their profits are on the decline,
their product quality is generally poor and some have become the
major polluters in their localities.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Passes Ali Boxing Reform Act </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The proposed Muhammad Ali Boxing
Reform Act, a first step in Congress' attempt to bring financial
reform to the sport, passed the U.S. House by voice vote Monday.
</P>
<P>
The bill targets promoters and sanctioning bodies, placing
limits on one-sided contracts that often favor the promoter, and
on the complex, conflict-of-interest-marred money trail that often
accompanies big-time fights.
</P>
<P>
The bill's key reforms would:
</P>
<P>
-- place a one-year limit on the length of a contract between a
promoter and boxer;
</P>
<P>
-- prohibit a promoter from having a financial interest in the
management of a boxer, and prohibit the manager from having a
financial relationship with a promoter;
</P>
<P>
-- prohibit improper payments from promoters or managers to
sanctioning bodies, such as the WBA, WBC and IBF;
</P>
<P>
-- require the sanctioning bodies to establish objective and
consistent criteria for ranking boxers.
</P>
<P>
The Senate passed the bill in 1998, but the House didn't take
up the measure before that congressional term ended.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Abdurrahman
Wahid Monday congratulated the Thomas Cup team that had
successfully retained the cup and encouraged the women to strive
harder.
</P>
<P>
Greeting the Thomas and Uber Cup teams here, the president said
the failure of the women's team in the Uber Cup championship was
normal in sports but hoped they would do better in the future.
</P>
<P>
He said it was necessary to give a special attention to the
very popular sport branch to improve performance for the future
and hoped future progress in economic conditions could help
improve sports facilities in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian men thrashed China 3-0 to retain the Thomas Cup
for the fourth successive time and their 12th victory since 1958.
The Indonesian women lost 0-3 to China in the Uber Cup semi-finals.
China retained its title with a 3-0 win over Denmark.
</P>
<P>
The chief of the Indonesian Badminton Association Subagyo
Hadisiswoyo said the success of the Thomas Cup team as well as the
failure of the Uber Cup team would be evaluated and efforts would
be made to improve them for the upcoming Olympic Games in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
He said the men's players needed to fine-tune their skills
before the Olympics in September.
</P>
<P>
"We already know the individual strengths of our rivals. Based
on this observation, we can measure our shuttlers' strengths and
weaknesses so we can sharpen them before the Olympics," he was
quoted by the Jakarta Post Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Taufik Hidayat's win over Ji Xinpeng, the Japan Open champion,
boosted the hope of the 18-year-old player for the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"I'm eying a gold in the Olympics men's singles. The most
dangerous contenders are definitely Chinese shuttlers," he said.
</P>
<P>
The teams will hold a victory parade in Jakarta on Tuesday,
starting from the National Sports Council's office in Senayan,
Central Jakarta, and ending at the National Training Center in
Cipayung, East Jakarta.

<HEADLINE> Drought Threatens Summer Harvest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The severe drought in northern
China and parts of the south threatens the summer grain production,
also leaving less water for millions of residents and livestock,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
At least 12.66 million hectares of crop land have had less rain
than usual, the State Flood-Control and Drought Prevention Office
was quoted by today's China Daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
The lack of rainfall has caused a temporary shortage of
drinking water for 15.6 million people and 13.1 million livestock.
</P>
<P>
The situation has prompted the agriculture and water resources
ministries to issue an urgent circular over the weekend to prod
local governments into taking every possible measures to find
other sources of water and expand irrigation areas.
</P>
<P>
Continuous dry weather, coupled with strong winds in most of
north China since February, has dramatically reduced soil moisture.
</P>
<P>
"The widespread, severe drought has occurred in the country's
major areas for summer crops," said the notice, adding that it
happened at the critical moment for the crop's growth.
</P>
<P>
In the past decade, droughts have affected more than 20 million
hectares of Chinese farmland each year, reducing grain output by
more than 30 million tons a year, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
The circular also required that limited water resources be
first used to ensure drinking water and then for irrigating fields
that supply seeds and grain for farmers.

<HEADLINE> Fiji's Council of Chiefs Starts Meeting on Coup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Fiji's Great Council of Chiefs
began a meeting Tuesday to consider a solution to the armed coup
that deposed the country's Indian-dominated government four days
ago, reports from Suva said.
</P>
<P>
More than 40 traditional chiefs from the island nation met
behind barbed wire at an army barracks 6 km outside the capital.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, chaired by former prime minister Sitiveni Rabuka,
began as shots were heard in the country's parliament buildings
where Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry and members of the cabinet
continue to be held.
</P>
<P>
Coup leader George Speight was not expected to address the
Great Council of Chiefs, although President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara
was attending and was expected to outline his plan to end the
current crisis to his fellow chiefs.
</P>
<P>
Speight told the media in the early hours Tuesday morning that
he would not attend the chiefs' meeting out of respect, but other
reports said he was not attending because he hadn't been invited
and had been warned by police he could be arrested if he walked
out of the Parliamentary complex.
</P>
<P>
Speight and a group of armed supporters occupied Fiji's
parliament building on Friday, saying they wanted to return power
to ethnic Fijians.
</P>
<P>
Many Fijian businesses closed on Monday, most in support of a
general strike called in support of the Chaudhry government.
</P>
<P>
Speight has demanded a full and immediate abrogation of the
1997 constitution, the resignation of President Mara and a legal
framework installed to safeguard the interests of indigenous
Fijians.

WASHINGTON, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The State Patrol on Monday
arrested the 43-year-old man believed responsible for the wrong-
way crash that killed swingman Malik Sealy of the National
Basketball Association's Minnesota Timberwolves, according to
reports from Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
Investigators have until noon Wednesday to present the case to
the Hennepin County Attorney's Office for formal charges against
Souksangouane Phengsene, of Minneapolis, who remained under guard
at Hennepin County Medical Center, where he's being treated for
serious injuries.
</P>
<P>
Investigators said Phengsene was driving the wrong way on a
highway early Saturday morning when his pickup smashed into Sealy'
s sports utility truck in the Minneapolis suburb of St. Louis Park,
fatally injuring the popular player who was returning from
teammate Kevin Garnett's 24th birthday celebration.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Timberwolves coach Flip Saunders attended a memorial
ceremony for mentor Bill Musselman, who coached him at the

HARBIN, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Suifenhe, a Chinese city bordering
Russia, has become the most bustling city for foreign trade in
northeast China's Heilongjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
It had earned 184 million U.S. dollars in foreign trade during
the first three months of this year with a growth rate of 52.4

Suifenhe has earned 2.59 billion U.S. dollars over the past

</P>
<P>
Local officials in charge of foreign trade attribute the
healthy growth to the positive foreign trade policies mapped out
by the central government. These policies require lower tariffs,
and diversified export commodities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Suifenhe exported more high value-added products
such as TV sets, refrigerators, and vacuum cleaners to its

<HEADLINE> China Launches Emergency Sand-Harnessing Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Compelled by the frequent sandstorms
that have blown across north China, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region initiated an emergency project to tackle the sandbank
endangering the Chinese capital of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
According to the project worked out by the central government,
the autonomous region in north China will try to improve the
environment in three key areas to reduce possibility of sandstorms.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the project is expected to harness 1.2
million hectares of sand in three years. The central government
will pay 100 yuan (12 U.S. dollars) per mu (15 mu = one hectare)
of land to be enclosed from grazing in order to protect grassland.
</P>
<P>
The three projected areas, occupying 48.2 million square
kilometers with some 10 million population, are close to Beijing
and its neighboring municipality of Tianjin. A sandlot in the
areas is moving towards Beijing at an annual pace of 1.8
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile 10 seed bases will be established in the autonomous
region.
</P>
<P>
This spring, at least 11 sandstorms have swept through the
autonomous region, which used to be prairie stretching across the
horizon. Beijing alone has been hit by nine sandstorms during the
season.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that China's sandstorm damage results in
economic loss of 54 billion yuan (6.5 billion U.S. dollars) each
year.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Tianjin, a transportation hub in
north China, will spend nearly 10 billion yuan (1.2 billion U.S.
dollars) by the year 2010 to improve traffic infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The municipality neighboring Beijing is inviting foreign
investment to initiate six major projects.
</P>
<P>
It planned to construct two wharves for cargo-passenger
carriers in Beijiang Port of the municipality with 500 million
yuan (60 million U.S. dollars). The two wharves are designed to
enable the large liners to berth as well as to handle containers.
</P>
<P>
Another five wharves to be built for containers' loading and
unloading will cost three billion yuan (361 million U.S. dollars)
in total.
</P>
<P>
The port city is also working on a new lock crossing the Haihe
River. The lock will help ships with 100,000 tons of capacity to
navigate between the Haihe River and the Chinese interior Sea of
Bohai. The project is expected to be completed in three years at a
cost of 335 million yuan (40.4 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The traffic hub will devote four billion yuan (482 million U.S.
dollars) building a cargo distribution center, occupying 12 square
kilometers of land near the port.
</P>
<P>
The lower reaches of Haihe River will be constructed into a
multi-functional economic zone. The docks along the banks also are
expected to be built with foreign funding.

<HEADLINE> Diplomat Sees Chaos in Fiji if President Removed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- There would be chaos in Fiji if
President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara was removed from power, the
Fijian High Commissioner in Australia said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Well I'm hoping that the Council of Chiefs is going to be wise
and support Ratu Mara because then the rule of law will still
prevail," Ratu Isoa Gavidi told Channel Nine TV.
</P>
<P>
"One can only hope that wisdom will prevail and Ratu Mara will
still be in control because if we lose him we will have chaos in
Fiji," he said.
</P>
<P>
While he understood some of coup leader George Speight's
sentiments, Ratu Isoa Gavidi said the indigenous Fijians would
suffer in the end.
</P>
<P>
He said the Fijian economy had been developed by the Indians
and they would not be the ones to suffer from the coup attempt.
</P>
<P>
"Also we can see already in Fiji that there are some
differences between the Fijians, I can see that there could be
even strain between the Fijians, Fijians versus Fijians and Fiji
could degenerate into something that you see on television
everyday," he said.
</P>
<P>
"So in the end nobody will win," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The head coach of the German
National Football Team Erich Ribbeck offered his 22-player squad
for Euro 2000 on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The German squad is as follows:
</P>
<P>
Goalkeepers: Oliver Kahn (Bayern Munich/30 years/23 caps), Jens
Lehmann (Borussia Dortmund/30/11), Hans-Joerg Butt (SV Hamburg/25/
0)
</P>
<P>
Defenders: Markus Babbel (Bayern Munich/27/47), Thomas Linke (
Bayern Munich/30/13), Lothar Matthaues (New York MetroStars/39/146)
, Jens Nowotny (Bayer Leverkusen//26/17), Marko Rehmer (Hertha BSC
Berlin/28/9)
</P>
<P>
Midfielders: Michael Ballack (Bayer Leverkusen/23/5), Sebastian
Deisler (Hertha BSC Berlin/20/1), Thomas Haessler (1860 Munich/34/
97), Dietmar Hamann (Liverpool/26/22), Jens Jeremies (Bayern
Munich/26/22), Carsten Ramelow (Bayer Leverkusen/26/7), Mehmet
Scholl (Bayern Munich/29/24), Dariusz Wosz (Hertha BSC Berlin/30/

him because he has vast experience."

<HEADLINE> Keegan Brings in Barry for Wilcox  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 22 (Xinhua) -- English soccer team manager Kevin
Keegan has drafted Aston Villa defender Gareth Barry into their
provisional Euro 2000 squad after Jason Wilcox withdrew through
injury.
</P>
<P>
Barry had originally been placed on stand-by along with Frank
Lampard last week when Keegan announced his provisional 28-man
squad for Euro 2000.
</P>
<P>
He was due to join the under-21 squad leaving for their own
European Championships in Slovakia later this week until he
received the call from the senior party.
</P>
<P>
Keegan said: "Jason has had a knee injury for the last two or
three weeks at Leeds. I had him down yesterday, the medical
people have checked him out and have sent him back to Leeds."
</P>
<P>
"We don't feel he had any chance of getting back for a place in
the 22. I'm disappointed, he was devastated - I think that's the
second time that had happened to him," added Keegan.
</P>
<P>
"With Jason pulling out, it had to be Gareth because he is a
left-footed player. He is used to playing in big games now."
</P>
<P>
Wilcox, who would definitely have travelled to Holland and
Belgium according to Keegan, admitted: "I'm bitterly disappointed.
"
</P>
<P>
"When I spoke to the specialist he made it clear that there was
no other option and that surgery was required immediately," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Keegan also revealed that Andy Cole is due to see a specialist
later this week after training for the first time in three weeks.
</P>
<P>
"Touch wood he'll be okay," he added.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Military Rules Out "Goodwill Gesture" to Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish military on Tuesday
dismissed the widely-spread speculation that Turkey may take the
initiative to dismantle its Aegean Army as a "goodwill gesture" to
Greece.
</P>
<P>
"In recent days, certain press organizations have been
publishing news and comments to the effect that the General Staff
views the dismantling of the Aegean Army as a positive step," said
a statement, adding that "Chief of General Staff General Huseyin
Kivrikoglu has not exchanged views with anybody over abolishing the
Aegean Army."
</P>
<P>
The sternly-worded statement declared that "There is no subject
on the General Staff's agenda to dismantle the Aegean Army."
</P>
<P>
Turkey and its neighboring Greece have long been locked in
disputes over the Aegean Sea and Cyprus. But relations between the
two countries have improved since last year when they rushed to the
aid of each other following massive earthquakes in both countries.
Over the past two days the Turkish press have devoted much of
their space to speculation that former Turkish Naval Forces
Commander
Guven Erkaya has drawn up a four-page action plan for Prime
Minister Bulent Ecevit aimed at realizing peace in the Aegean Sea
and bolstering Turkish-Greek relations.
</P>
<P>
As one of the Prime Ministry's chief advisers, Erkaya allegedly
advocated in his report that in the course of the European Union
accession process, Turkey should solve its problems with Greece by
2004.
</P>
<P>
The report presumed that Greece was definitely not considering
to extend its territorial waters in the Aegean to 12 miles. In the
context of negotiations for a way out of the Aegean Crisis, Greece
is likely to wait Turkey to renounce its standing threat to use
force against Greece.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, by dismantling the Aegean Army as a
first concrete step, Turkey may demonstrate its flexibility and
sincerity in solving the hardcore issues that have strained the
relations between the two NATO allies for decades.
</P>
<P>
There have been no reports on how the government evaluates the
retired general's suggestions.
</P>
<P>
The Aegean Army was established as the country's fourth army on
May 20, 1975, after the Turkish troops invaded and occupied the
northern part of Cyprus in 1974 in the wake of a short-lived pro-
Athens coup in Nicosia. The army's first and second commanders,
Turgut Sunalp and Kenan Evren, later became Turkish presidents.
</P>
<P>
The 100,000-strong Aegean Army's order of battle is six brigade
command staffs, four regimental command staffs, nine battalions,
air
defense units, anti-air artillery batteries and logistical support
units.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Reiterates Adherence to "One China" Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Deputy Prime Minister Youssef
Amin Wali reiterated on Tuesday that Egypt adheres to the "one
China"
policy.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with visiting Chinese State Councillor Wang
Zhongyu, Wali said there is only one China in the world and Taiwan
is a part of China.
</P>
<P>
Both Egypt and China are countries which have ancient
civilization, Wali said. The two countries have maintained friendly
relations since they established diplomatic ties in 1956, he added.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin traveled to Egypt's Mediterranean
port city of Alexandria in April within a regional tour for a
special meeting with his Egyptian counterpart Hosni Mubarak, Wali
said, adding that this demonstrated the friendly bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhongyu, who arrived in Cairo on Monday, expressed
gratitude to the Egyptian government for its constant adherence to
the "one China" position.
</P>
<P>
He briefed Wali on the great achievements made by China in the
economic reforms and opening to the outside world during the past
two decades.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese official, who led a delegation of the Chinese
Central Auditing Agency, called for cooperation with Egypt in the
field of auditing in a bid to help promote the economic and social
development of the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Annan Calls for Specific Solutions from Morocco, Polisario on W. Sahara </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 23 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Tuesday called on Morocco and the Polisario Front to come up
with specific solutions to problems that have delayed a referendum
on the future of Western Sahara for more than eight years.
</P>
<P>
Annan, in his written report to the U.N. Security Council,
said face-to-face talks held on May 14 in London under the
auspices of his special envoy, former U.S. Secretary of State
James Baker, only reinforced the U.N. assessment of "their widely
divergent positions."
</P>
<P>
Also, "neither side offered any constructive suggestions on
the way forward" at their first direct talks conducted by Baker
since 1997, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has long been trying to organize a
referendum to decide whether Western Sahara should be incorporated
in Morocco, which controls most of the former Spanish colony, or
become independent, as sought by the Polisario Front.
</P>
<P>
But the referendum, first set for January 1992, has been
repeatedly postponed due to differences over who should be
eligible to vote.
</P>
<P>
Referring to another round of talks that might be held some
time in June, Annan said he strongly hoped that, as requested by
Baker, "the parties will come forward with concrete proposals at
the proposed meeting."
</P>
<P>
"Given the difficulties over the years in bridging their
recurrent differences, and the fact that no enforcement mechanism
was envisaged in the (U.N.) settlement plan, it would be essential
that the parties now offer specific and concrete solutions to the
multiple problems relating to the implementation of the plan, that
can be agreed to," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Alternatively, they should "be prepared to consider other ways
of achieving an early, durable and agreed solution of their
dispute" over Western Sahara, he said.

<HEADLINE> Failure of Voice Recording Box Hampers U.S. Investigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The charter airplane's cockpit voice recorder is blank, said
George Black, a National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)
investigator.
</P>
<P>
Nineteen people were killed as the plane crashed in overcast
conditions on May 21 as it approached the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton
International Airport in Pennsylvania State.
</P>
<P>
"There are no sounds from the cockpit on the tape," Black said.
"This seriously hampers the investigation, let's face it."
</P>
<P>
He said the device had an improper power supply; an inverter
that would have allowed the recorder to operate on the plane's
power had not been installed. NTSB officials were investigating
whether some other modification had been done to allow the
recorder to get power.
</P>
<P>
The plane did not have the other type of "black box" recorder,
the one that takes down flight data such as speed and altitude,
because it was not required for the model of airplane, a Jetstream
31.
</P>
<P>
Investigators hoped to begin removing wreckage from the site
Tuesday. But rainfall since the crash has muddied the ground,
complicating efforts to get heavy equipment into the area deep in
the northeastern Pennsylvania woods.
</P>
<P>
With no data recorder information, investigators will rely on
that wreckage, witnesses, radar data and a conversation between
the two pilots and air traffic controllers. The pilots said they
had lost both engines as they made their second approach to the
airport.
</P>
<P>
Evidence at the scene showed that both engines were not running
at the time of the crash, Black said.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, May 23 (Xinhua)--Two Colombians died Tuesday
after the fall of the light aircraft in which they traveled at San
Fransico Los Ecuentros village, west Guatemala, said police.
</P>
<P>
Guatemalan authorities didn't report if this air disaster
caused fatal victims on land, due to the plane falling upon a
dwelling, according to reports reaching here from Guatemala's
capital and received in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman from Department of Antinarcotic Operations (DOAN)
of Civil National Police (PNC) identified deceased Colombians as
Julio Fernando Arango and Hector Calderon.
</P>
<P>
This spokesman didn't specify causes of the plane's
plummeting nor the route it was following.
</P>
<P>
DOAN agents are investigating if the airplane is related to
drug trafficking, although right now traces of drugs haven't been
found in the apparatus's remains.
</P>
<P>
Last week, two light aircraft fell to ground in different
places of Guatemala, one on a mountainous area and another on a
city farm in Coban, Alta Verapaz department, resulting in nine
killed.

<HEADLINE> CIS Customs Union to Become International Economic Forum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The summit of the Customs Union of
the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), which opened Tuesday
in Belarus capital of Minsk, reached a decision to turn the union
into an international economic forum this Autumn.
</P>
<P>
This decision will give strong impetus to the union and lead to
the deepening of ties among the former soviet republics, Russian
President Vladimir Putin told reporters after the summit of the
union, which unites Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and
Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
All participants of the meeting want to see the union become a
more credible organization, which will be named "the Euroasian
Customs Union," Putin noted.
</P>
<P>
The decisions made in Minsk will encourage the legislative and
executive authorities of the union's member-states to work toward
closer integration, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Inter-State Council of the union decided to instruct the
governments and the integration committee of the five countries to
form a working group in charge of transforming the union into an
international economic organization.
</P>
<P>
The organization will deal with the problems related to entry
into the World Trade Organization, demarcation of the common
customs space outer limits, uniform foreign economic policy,
tariffs and prices.These functions will give the future
international economic forum a common market status.
</P>
<P>
The council also discussed the last steps of forming a free
trade zone.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the five countries intend to conclude a document
on establishing a full-scale free trade zone as the main stage to
the development of a common customs territory of the union.
</P>
<P>
The goal is to create favorable conditions for the operations
of the states' manufacturers and to raise the competitiveness of
their output as well as to promote mutual trade.
</P>
<P>
Customs Union leaders mulled the harmonization of the customs
laws of their countries, a necessary step to standardize the free
movements of commodities, capital and services among member-
countries.
</P>
<P>
Putin and Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov flied to
Minsk on Tuesday to attend a session of the inter-state council.
</P>
<P>
The prime ministers of the five countries also meet in Minsk
the same day to approve steps to implement the agreement on legal
guarantees of the formation of the Customs Union and a common
economic space.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, Minsk will host a session of the CIS collective
security council which unites the countries of the Customs Union
and Armenia.
</P>
<P>
Putin is expected to hold several bilateral meetings with the
heads of other participating countries.

MEXICO CITY, May 23 (Xinhua)-- Mexican authorities declared
Tuesday alert at Acapulco tourist port, where three bathers died
this Tuesday due to strong waves caused by tropical storm "Aletta".
</P>
<P>
According to National Meteorological Service (SMN), Aletta is
the first tropical storm of the season and is found 320 kilometers
southeast of Mexico's capital.
</P>
<P>
In a few hours, the phenomenon will intensify the strength of
its winds while it moves at 10 kilometers an hour upon Mexico's
Pacific coasts.
</P>
<P>
Acapulco authorities considered possible the fall of rains
after this Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It was forbidden for tourists to go into the sea because in
certain areas waves rose up four meters high, they added.
</P>

disappeared and 5,000 victims in the state of Guerrero.

<HEADLINE> Trimble Plan Faces New Challenge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble
's plan to return to a Northern Ireland power-sharing government
is expected to be challenged by dissidents within his party.
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Donaldson, a member in the British parliament, revealed
Tuesday that anti-Good Friday Agreement activists in the party
were working on their own plan for devolved government.
</P>
<P>
He said this will be put to the Ulster Unionist Council before
Saturday's crucial vote over whether to return to a power-sharing
executive.
</P>
<P>
But Donaldson would not be drawn on the full details of the
proposal.
</P>
<P>
He said their package would deal "with the issue of arms and
the issue of government".
</P>
<P>
Donaldson's announcement would appear to be an attempt to
counter comments by Trimble that anti-Agreement unionists have no
alternative to the decommissioning and devolution deal.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Trimble and his supporters were engaged in a series
of phone calls and background strategy meetings at Stormont ahead
of the 860-member ruling council's vote.
</P>
<P>
The IRA's political wing Sinn Fein also warned Britain on
Tuesday that concessions to Protestant majority in the province
had angered Roman Catholic republicans at a crunch time in the
region's peace drive.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams, speaking 24 hours after his
party said the Irish Republican Army might withdraw a key offer on
arms inspection, said the IRA offer still remains on the table.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly the IRA have not withdrawn their initiative, so it
obviously remains on the table," Adams told BBC.
</P>
<P>
"What I'm trying to deal with is a backlash from the republican
base, which is something which I have never experienced in all my
years of engagement with the republican base in terms of its
intensity," he said.
</P>
<P>
His warning came in the run-up to a crucial vote on Saturday by
the 860-strong executive council of the divided Ulster Unionist
Party (UUP) on whether to go back into power-sharing government
with Catholics.

<HEADLINE> Millennium Dome Chief Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ayling stepped down as chairman of the New Millennium
Experience Company (NMEC) at a board meeting on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
His departure was one of a number of conditions imposed by the
Millennium Commission in return for granting the Dome a further 29
million pounds (46.4 million U.S. dollars) from National Lottery
funds.
</P>
<P>
The Dome has been dogged by lower than expected attendances.
Current projections forecast that seven million visitors will pass
through its doors - rather than the 12 million originally
predicted.
</P>
<P>
The attraction has already received 509 million pounds (824.4
million dollars) of lottery money.
</P>
<P>
The Millennium Commission said it had "serious reservations"
about bailing out the Dome for a second time and imposed "
stringent conditions" on the grant.
</P>
<P>
It was the second major shake-up at the Dome: Jennie Page
stepped down as head of the attraction in January and was replaced
by Pierre Yves Gerbeau.
</P>
<P>
Former TV executive and NMEC board member, Michael Grade, is
now tipped to replace Ayling.

<HEADLINE> Worldwide Knowledge Management Spending Expected to Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Knowledge management is picking
up momentum and getting ready to leave the early adopter stage
behind, according to a report released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report by U.S. market research firm International Data
Corporation (IDC) said that no longer is technology driving
interest in knowledge management. Instead, the desire to meet
business goals is creating the enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
According to IDC, this desire will spark a spurge in spending,
and by 2003 knowledge management services will be a worldwide
market of more than 8 billion U.S. dollars, up from 1.3 billion
dollars in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Knowledge management is an umbrella term for making more
efficient use of the human knowledge that exists within an
organization. IDC defines knowledge management as a formal process
that evaluates a company's organizational processes, people and
technology, and develops a system that leverages the relationships
between these components to get the right information to the right
people at the right time to improve productivity.
</P>
<P>
"Today, the most common reasons companies initiate knowledge
management projects are for growing revenue and profit, retaining
key talent and expertise, and improving customer services," said
the report.
</P>
<P>
Another indication of knowledge management's importance,
according to the report, is the change in the person deciding to
initiate these types of projects. Formerly, the decisions were
driven by information technology departments; today, senior
managers are initiating these projects.
</P>
<P>
To achieve their business goals, the report said, organizations
implementing knowledge management initiatives are focusing on
applications involving knowledge sharing, best practices and
customer relationship management.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Ex-President Urges African Leaders to Embrace Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Former Zambian President Kenneth
Kaunda has urged African leaders to find ways of minimizing the
suffering of their people by avoiding conflict and civil wars,
reported the Ghana News Agency Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a pre-departure interview in Ghanaian capital Accra
after a two-day private visit to Ghana, Kaunda said African
leaders should think about the suffering of their people by
planning effectively and strategically about their progress.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted Kaunda as saying that Africa continues to
experience turbulent periods of political and economic development
at a time the continent should be competing with the world
economy.
</P>
<P>
"The world is not waiting for us and therefore we must do
everything possible to build a stable environment on which the
people will be free to lead a peaceful and enjoyable life," said
the veteran leader.
</P>
<P>
He also mentioned sources of the numerous conflicts on the
continent as " land disputes which were bequeathed to us during
the period of demarcation by the colonial masters".
</P>
<P>
There is no magic wand in building a stable society, he said,
adding that it is only achieved through love for each other and
the avoidance of tribalism.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Internet Dominance Fading in Asia, Says Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 23 (Xinhua) -- China and India will outpace
Japan in Internet growth in the near future, according to
predictions made by a U.S. research firm providing statistics and
demographic data about Internet users.
</P>
<P>
China's active Internet user base will grow from 2.5 million in
1999 to 21 million by 2003, an increase of 750 percent, said
eMarketer in its eAsia report. India's active Internet use will
reach 9 million in 2003, from just 270,000 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, the report said, Japan which currently
dominates the Asian Internet will see its Internet base increase
from 10.3 million in 1999 to 31 million by 2003. But Japan's
percentage as Asia's leading Internet market will decrease from 48
percent to 32 percent over the same period.
</P>
<P>
It will be alternative forms of Internet access, such as cable
modem and wireless access which could drive China and India to the
forefront of the Internet marketplace, the report said. Today,
areas of the two countries are not properly wired for traditional
phone access. They boast two of the largest cellular phone and
cable television markets in the world and that alone may allow
them to become the next Asian Internet powerhouses, eMarketer said.
</P>
<P>
While representing more than 50 percent of the global
population, the report said, Asia represents only 16.6 percent of
the world's Internet users. This percentage will increase
significantly over the next several years. By year-end 2000,
active adult Internet users in Asia will number 38 million, and by
2003, this figure will grow to 95.85 million online users, or 25.7
percent of the world's total.
</P>
<P>
A great disparity exists in Internet penetration rates
throughout Asia, according to the report. Approximately one half
of Asian countries have penetration rates of less than 3 percent,
while Singapore boasts a rate of almost 40 percent. Men represent
78 percent of all users in Asia, compared to the United States
where males represent the remaining 49 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report also notes that Asia's e-commerce growth will
increase to 88 billion U.S. dollars in 2003 from 6.6 billion
dollars at year-end 1999, and B2B will represent 87 percent of the
region's total.
</P>
<P>
In online advertising spending, the report said, Asia will soon
equal the United States as a percentage of total advertising. In
1999, the Asia-Pacific region spent 230 million U.S. dollars in
online advertising, or 5.3 percent of the worldwide total. By 2003,
this number will increase to 2.61 billion dollars, or 10 percent
of the worldwide totals.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Republicans Agree on Package to Spur Development in Poor Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton and
House Speaker Dennis Hastert on Tuesday jointly announced a
multibillion-dollar package of tax breaks and other benefits to
attract investment and jobs to poor areas.
</P>
<P>
"We have achieved an agreement that will allow us to give every
family in every community a stake in the prosperity Americans have
worked so hard to build," Clinton said at a White House ceremony
announcing the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The White House and Republicans led by Hastert agreed Monday
night to blend competing plans for boosting the economic status of
places that have not enjoyed America's current boom.
</P>
<P>
White House economic adviser Gene Sperling estimated the
program would cost 5 to 7 billion U.S. dollars over five years,
but would leverage that much or more in new investment and
economic power.
</P>
<P>
"If we can put our ideas together and the best ideas together,
I think we can create a better America," Hastert said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has made several trips to inner cities, Indian
reservations and patches of rural America to promote his economic
growth ideas for what he calls "new markets" at home. Clinton's
plan features tax credits, loan guarantees and other inducements
for businesses to invest in these places.
</P>
<P>
Hastert has championed a plan with similar aims. In 40 proposed
"renewal communities," tax credits and other lures to new
investment are coupled with a capital gains tax cut.
</P>
<P>
An existing program of empowerment zones, also designed to help
economically distressed areas, would be expanded under the
bipartisan program.
</P>
<P>
Supporters expect the House to vote on the new package this
year. There is no similar unified package before the Senate.
