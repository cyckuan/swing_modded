<HEADLINE> World Gold Demand Rises 17.1 Pct in Half Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- World gold demand rose by 17.1
percent to a record 2,028 tons in the first half of this year,
according to the Gold Fields Mineral Services (GFMS) consultancy
today.
</P>
<P>
In its latest gold market update, the GFMS said that there was
also an increase in mine output in spite of low gold prices
although it was only 1.4 percent compared with the same months of
1996 at 1,161 tons.
</P>
<P>
It suggested that producer hedging, private sales and disposals
by central banks from their reserves helped to fill the growing
gap between newly mined gold and demand in the half year.
</P>
<P>
The consultancy estimated that forward sales and option hedging
by producers added 192 tons to gold supply in the first half of
this year whereas not one ton was made available in this way
during the same period in 1996.
</P>
<P>
There were an estimated 220 tons of net central bank sales,
including 200 tons of central bank gold whose sale has still to be
announced.
</P>
<P>
The gold market review said that the first half witnessed the
largest-ever shipment of physical gold to the Asian markets, above
all to the Middle East and India, with almost all of this being
destined for private sector purchases.
</P>
<P>
However, it added that the flow of gold from central banks,
private sellers and producer hedging is not likely to be enough to
push the gold price below present levels for any length of time.

<HEADLINE> Mortgage Rates Fall in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The cost of long-term
mortgages in Canada dropped today to their lowest level since
1965, local reports said.
</P>
<P>
The five-year mortgage rate drops to 6.85 percent, down 15
basis points, the lowest long-term rate available in Canada since
1965.
</P>
<P>
Loans of up to 25 years drop by as much as a quarter of a
percentage point, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The latest cuts will be a boon for first-time buyers who tend
to favor longer-term loans to have predictable carrying costs,
said a top official at Toronto-Dominion (TD) Bank.
</P>
<P>
The rate reduction came on the heels of a bond market rally
that has trimmed 15 to 20 basis points from bond yields in the
past two months.
</P>
<P>
Bond yields are a benchmark for mortgage rates because they
reflect the cost of funding the loans.
</P>
<P>
Royal Bank of Canada was the first on Monday to announce the
reduction of 15 to 25 basis points for terms of four years to 25
years.
</P>
<P>
Other commercial banks, such as TD Bank, Bank of Montreal and
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, quickly matched the move.

<HEADLINE> Ghana's President Calls on Africans to Live </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Ghanaian President Jerry
Rawlings has called on Africans to live modestly although there
may be no legal sanctions against the display of affluence and
materialism.
</P>
<P>
"We all have a fundamental duty to live modestly, given our
continent's turbulent historical fight against corruption,"
Rawlings said in Accra, capital of Ghana, on Monday at the
opening of the 5th African conference of ombudsmen.
</P>
<P>
The four-day conference, themed "the importance of
administrative justice in the democratization process in Africa",
is being attended by delegates from 17 African countries,
according to a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Rawlings told the participants that the ordinary citizen's
conformity to law and order "depends on the transparency of the
public official's integrity".
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the arbitration role of traditional councils
must be given the chance to reduce the volume of court cases,
saying: "I sincerely believe that there is need and room for our
traditional process of arbitration to contribute to our
democractic process and delivery of social justice."
</P>
<P>
According to Rawlings, Africa's modernization has seen the
erosion of traditional values and practices which in the past
provided protection for both the individual and community.
</P>
<P>
"In the past, taboos and moral edicts were sufficient
deterrents for various crimes. Today, neither our elaborate
criminal codes nor court punishments against social malpratices
have deterred their occurrence. Rather, they are on the
increase," Rawlings said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that democracy and administrative justice are,
therefore, guaranteed not only by formal institutions, some of
which tend to be alien to African culture, but also require the
responsibility or good will of the individual.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Won's New Low Against Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean won today
plunged to a new low against the U.S. dollar after three days of
consecutive decrease, threatening to break the 915-won level.
</P>
<P>
The won fell in today's trading to as low as 914.50 won against
one dollar, the lowest since the nation introduced an average
market rate system in March 1990.
</P>
<P>
The nation's top bank official argued that such changes in
foreign exchange rate have not reached a worrisome level and the
situation would be stable soon.
</P>
<P>
The main reason to the depreciation was the massive buying of
dollars by local traders.
</P>
<P>
The won-dollar parity rate has been down by 7.6 percent since
the end of last year, when the figure was 844.20 won against one
dollar.
</P>
<P>
Despite the central bank's strong intervention, market
participants predict that the won's declination would last until
the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
However, Lee Kyong-shik, Governor of the Bank of Korea,
indicated that the situation is all right, saying that though the
won has inched down continuously lately, the declining pace is
almost the same as that of Japanese yen against the dollar.

<HEADLINE> Qian Meets With South African Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier
and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen met with South African Foreign
Minister Alfred Nzo here today, with both sides appreciating the
smooth development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
It was very appreciable that President Nelson Mandela and the
South African government decided to establish diplomatic relations
with China under the principle of "One China," said Qian, who is
attending the 52nd session of the United Nations General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Establishment of diplomatic relations was in accordance with
the fundamental interests of the people of the two nations and
will provide necessary conditions for the two sides to conduct
cooperation in various fields, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Qian also appreciated Nzo's efforts in pushing forward the
normalization of relations between China and South Africa and his
positive attitude on the "One China" principle.
</P>
<P>
Qian noted that South Africa has an important role in the
regional and international affairs. After the establishment of
diplomatic relations, the two countries could conduct cooperation
in many areas, and enhance consultations and cooperation
in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Nzo said that the decision of the South African government to
establish diplomatic ties with China can never be changed. After
the normalization of the bilateral relations, he said, the
potentials of cooperation can be brought into full play, bringing
lots of benefit to the people of both countries.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are being engaged in economic and trade
exchanges, which can be promoted to a bigger scale after the
establishment of the diplomatic links, according to Nzo, who added
that the two countries can have effective cooperation in the
affairs of the United Nations and on other international arenas.
</P>
<P>
He said that China is a reliable friend of Africa. For a long
time, China has been in sympathy with and support the African
people. South Africa hopes to continue to develop its cooperation
with China.

functioning of a democratic system," he said.
</P>

independent electoral commission, made a visit to France on Monday
to seek advice from French government on the election.
</P>
<P>
It is for the Camerounian government to decide whether the
regularity of voting will be better ensured by the presence of a

</P>
<P>
He stressed that France considers it necessary for Cameroun to
find a "lasting consensus to implement the democratic system."

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The ninth session of the
Russian-U.S. joint commission on economic and technical
cooperation (Chernomyrdin-Gore commission) wound up here today
with more than 15 inter-governmental and inter-departmental
agreements signed.
</P>
<P>
According to the Itar-Tass news agency, both Russian Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and U.S. Vice President Albert Gore
were satisfied with the results of the session.
</P>
<P>

development of investment cooperation, assistance in Russia's
integration into the world economy as well as international
economic and financial bodies, the report said.

times in the first half of this year. Now they make one third of
the overall foreign investments in the Russian economy, according

<HEADLINE> Military Situation in Angola "Quiet" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Joint Committee for
Angolan Peace process said today that the military situation in
Angola is basically quiet,
</P>
<P>
The committee made the conclusion at a meeting on national
situation.
</P>
<P>
The meeting mainly discussed issues concerning the
re-establishment of national authoritative institutions in areas
occupied by the former rebel movement UNITA and the registration
and disarmament of UNITA's remaining militiamen.
</P>
<P>
The committee expressed satisfaction over the re-establishment
of national authority in 79 regions occupied by UNITA. Both the
government and UNITA agreed that regional governments will be
established in Uige and Lunda-Norte provinces on September 29 and
30.
</P>
<P>
It is disclosed at the meeting that up to now, 3,341 UNITA
fighters have participated in registration. They have also handed
over 3,031 pieces of various weapons.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the committee was worried about the competence of
the militiamen and quality of their weapons.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that the Angolan government and the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) are accusing
each other of small-scale military operations in some provinces,
situation in the whole country is basically "quiet".
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Council of European Union Backs Annan's Reform Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Council of
European Union welcomed U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's
wide-range proposals for the reform of the United Nations, the
council's President Jacqure F. Poos said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 52nd session of the General Assembly, the
president said the secretary-general's ambitious proposals were
aimed to transform the organization into high-achieving, efficient
instrument at the service of all the people of the world.
</P>
<P>
"We need an organization that can carry out its mandate to
preserve peace and security in a faster and more effective way,
while building better capacities for actions in the fields of
preventive diplomacy, peace-keeping and peace-making and, has
more effective capacities of contributing to rehabilitation and
reconstruction after a conflict," said the president.
</P>
<P>
"We need an organization that is able to respond more
adequately to one of its fundamental objectives, which is
promoting economic and social progress, eradicating poverty and
ensure the widest possible participation in an expanding world
economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed, "We need a UN system that offers a credible
response to the complex problems of human assistance and
emergency situations, which include conflict prevention,
peace-keeping, rehabilitation and transition towards development."
</P>
<P>
The president said that to obtain the objectives, the
organization would have to be able to rely not only on the
commitment of the secretary-general and the cooperation of the
member states, but on the support of all sectors of the
international society, and in particular on the non-governmental
organizations.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Council of European Union did not intend to
press for the fine points of its own positions to be taken into
account in each of the proposals or recommendations which were on
the table. But it hoped the other countries would approach this
exercise in a similar spirit, and they could agree to put the
general positive trust of the package of proposals before the
satisfaction of their individual demands.
</P>
<P>
On the financial crisis of the organization, the president said
it could not be solved until all the member states had agreed to
meet their obligations under the United Nations Charter in fully,
by discharging the arrears which they owe and by paying on time
and without conditions the full amount of their mandatory
contributions to the organization's regular budget and to the
budget of peacekeeping operation.

<HEADLINE> Somali Faction Leader Returns to Mogadishu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The delegation led by
Abdurahman Ahmed Ali Tuur, deputy president of Somali faction
leader Hussein Aidid, reached the capital Mogadishu, late this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, which according to the authority of the break
away republic of Somaliland, have been deported today, consisted
of six cabinet ministers of Hussein Aidid's unrecognized
government.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after his arrival, Tuur, who looked very tired, made a
brief statement at his residence in south Mogadishu, saying his
tour in the northwestern regions of Somalia was completed as
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Tuur, who smoked one cigarette after another, told Xinhua that
his delegation have attended a luncheon with more than 60
ministers (of the break away republic), intellectuals and
traditional elders from Hargeisa and discussed with them about
the federal system for the first time.
</P>
<P>
They also talked about the security in the northwestern
regions.
</P>
<P>
Tuur said the delegation had planned to return to Mogadishu
today, and Egal (president of the break away republic of
Somaliland) himself knew about the departure plan.
</P>
<P>
"We were shocked by the news broadcast by Radio Hargeisa
telling my delegation to leave within 24 hours," said Tuur, who
admitted that he and his delegation were warmly received in
Hargeisa, adding that "We were seen off warmly".
</P>
<P>
This move by Egal, according to Tuur, is not any different
from an earlier death sentence he made against me and Jama
Mohamed Qalib, foreign minister of Hussein Aidid's self-crowned
government.
</P>
<P>
"The death sentence became impossible and so this will be," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Asked about whether he will again go back to Somaliland, Tuur
said, "Of course this will not be my last visit and more visits
will follow."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Tuur said the statement made by Egal last night will
only mess the security situation in those regions.
</P>
<P>
"We are working towards the pacification of our regions and
Somalia in general," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> EU Publishes Sustainable Development Indicators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Most European Union
countries have to rely heavily on non-renewable resources of
energy, which is predicted to be unsustainable in the long term.
</P>
<P>
The prediction was made today by Eurostat, the statistic arm of
the 15-nation union. The agency said that EU consumption of
renewable energy accounts for a mere 5 percent of total energy
consumption.
</P>
<P>
The consumption of renewable energy is comparatively high in
Finland, Austria and Sweden, all new members to the union, whereas
it is low in such older member states as Britain and Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Sweden leads the consumption chart of renewable resources of
energy with 24 percent while Britain is at the bottom of the chart
with 0.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Over the last decade, the use of natural gas is up 50 percent
and 55 percent more electricity is consumed due to the boom in
electrical appliances.
</P>
<P>
European Union-wide, each person consumes an average 2,388
kilograms of oil equivalent a year as the survey showed.
</P>
<P>
The result of the EU's pilot sustainable development indicator
study, as recommended by the United Nations Commission on
Sustainable Development, showed that estimated life of EU coal
reserves is 209 years, as compared with the worldwide figure of
147 years.
</P>
<P>
Ireland's coal will last 14,000 years whereas France's will
last for only 15 years.
</P>
<P>
The estimated life of coal reserves in the United States is 126
years and it is 117 years for Japan.

</P>
<P>
At next Monday's session, Boueiz will address the assembly

Boueiz will mention in his speech the Israeli aggression of
Lebanon's south and western Bekaa area, which has caused
material and human losses.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he will urge Israel to implement the
U.N. resolution 425 which demands Israel withdraw from Lebanon
unconditionally, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The issue of Lebanese detainees held in jails in Israel or in
Israeli camps in south Lebanon occupied by Israel will also be
raised in Boueiz's speech.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in New York, the foreign minister will meet
his counterparts from 15 countries. But the report did not say if
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy will be included.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has
announced in her maiden trip to the Middle East that she had made
arrangements for the meeting in Washington next week between
Israeli and Palestinian officials and she will meet senior

<HEADLINE> Primakov Calls for Solutions to UN Financial Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign
Minister Yevgeni Primakov today called for a quick solution to
the serious financial problems faced by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"Reform of the U.N. with an eye on its increase efficiency
would, of course, be inconceivable without overcoming financial
problems faced by the organization," Primakov said in an address
to the 52nd session of the U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The annual 52nd session opened last Tuesday with its general
debates focused on the reform of the largest international
organization.
</P>
<P>
The Russian foreign minister said that the U.N. financial
problems unfortunately "have become chronic." The debts owed by
some member states total 2.3 billion U.S. dollars, according to a
press release by the United Nations Informations Department.
</P>
<P>
The United States reportedly owes some 1.5 billion U.S. dollars
to the world body.
</P>
<P>
"It should be emphasized that all member states are responsible
for the UN financial health and that all of them must pay their
dues properly," Primakov stressed.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the widely-discussed reforms of the United
Nations, Primakov said that Russians "are in favor of expanding
the Security Council membership."
</P>
<P>
But he cautioned that such an expansion should not "render our
organization less efficient."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council now consists of 15 members, five of
which are permanent ones. Several proposals have been put
forward for the reforms of the council.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said that he hopes the U.N. reform will take place
against the background of an ever increasing role of regional
organization. Such a reform would be "logical process," he added.
</P>
<P>
"We see the U.N. in the 21st century as a highly efficient
organization free from bureaucratic constraints, as a pro-active
organization capable of swiftly responding to the challenges of
the contemporary world," he noted.

Speaking at the general debates of the 52nd session of the U.N.
General Assembly, Primakov said, "It is essential to create
conditions that would bring stability to a new world order."
</P>
<P>
He said that in the present-day world, no country in the world
should hold a monopoly on any conflict resolution effort.
</P>
<P>
"This fully applies to the longest standing conflict in the
Middle East where the settlement process has been stalemated," the
Russian foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes that "broad-based international efforts
are needed" to undo the tight Middle East knot.
</P>
<P>
"As one of the co-sponsors of the peace process launched in
1991 in Madrid, Russia is prepared to cooperate actively with
everyone to attain this goal," said Primakov.
</P>
<P>
He said that a synergy of efforts will provide the shortest cut
to the resolution of both long-standing and relatively new
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Primakov indicated that Russia will work together with the
United States to complete demolishing the hurdles of the past and,
above all, the legacy of the decades-long massive arms race.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the two strategic arms reduction treaties
reached with the United States, Russia is ready to move ahead
towards greater reduction, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Next on our agenda is the involvement of all nuclear powers in
systematic efforts to reduce their nuclear arms," he said.
</P>
<P>
But Primakov said that the stability of a multipolar world can be
assured not just by ending the nuclear arms race of the past.
</P>
<P>
Urgent measures are needed to prevent the proliferation of
nuclear weapons to other countries beyond nuclear powers, he said.

<HEADLINE> Suspected Lassa Fever Case Arouses Fears in Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 23 (Xinhua) -- German health authorities have
put about 100 people under medical supervision after they were
found to have come into contact with a Ghanaian man suspected of
dying of a deadly disease, Lassa fever, in Germany Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The 37-year-old Ghanaian died Saturday in the western German
city of Mainz after admitting himself to a local hospital.
</P>
<P>
He was suspected of having been infected with the Lassa virus
which regularly hits regions of West Africa and could claim the
lives of up to 40 percent of those infected. The virus is
transmitted through rat urine or human body fluids including
sweat.
</P>
<P>
German health authorities said today that no further cases of
the disease had been found so far among the about 100 people,
including hospital staff and friends of the Ghanaian, who had
contact with him. Even the first case was still to be confirmed by
laboratory tests Wednesday or Thursday, they added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, German investigators disclosed that the Ghanaian
patient had been deported from Germany in 1993 but returned
illegally on August 7 this year. He had stayed in the city of
Duesseldorf until September 9 before taking the train to Mainz.
</P>
<P>
The incubation period of the Lassa fever ranges from three days
to three weeks. Reports said the disease could be treated
effectively if diagnosed in the first six days.

<HEADLINE> Russian Missile Manufacturer Denies Deal With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- A Russian industrial company
denied today that it will sell anti-aircraft missiles to Turkey,
the semi-official Anatolia News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted Yevgeni Moskalenko, spokesman for the
Russian state-controlled Rosvoorouzhenie company, as saying that
the reports about the alleged Turkish-Russian missile deal are
"groundless."
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that the Turkish government is holding
contacts with the Russian company to buy S-300 missiles.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has not said that it wants to purchase the S-300
missiles, Moskalenko said, adding, however, that his company likes
to make such a deal with Turkey if the latter wishes.
</P>
<P>
The Russian company is among more than 200 Turkish and
international firms which are here to participate in the Third
Defense Industry and Civil Aviation Fair on September 23-26.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus signed an agreement with the Russian company to buy
hundreds of the S-300 missiles in an unannounced date around the
beginning of the year, causing a wave of tension between the small
island country and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Both Turkey and Turkish Cypriots criticized the Cypriot
government for the missile deal, describing it as a "provocative
move."
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government has said that it will use all necessary
means to block the transfer of the Russian-made missiles to the
Greek Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot South and Turkish
Cypriot North since 1974 when Turkish troops landed and took over
the northern third of the island following a failed coup seeking
union with Greece by some Greek Cypriots.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Surveys Minerals for Neighboring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has completed the
compilation of the geology and mineral resources of its neighbors of
Benin, Niger, Chad and Cameroon under a regional cooperation policy.
</P>
<P>
The exercise, according to Solid Minerals Development Minister
Kaloma Ali, was carried out through his ministry, the News Agency of
Nigeria reported today.
</P>
<P>
Ali also disclosed that the ministry was also cooperating with the
geological survey department of South Africa in the training of
staffers of the ministry in map production and publication of
geological map sheets for use by the Nigerian public and for the
benefit of mineral prospectors.
</P>
<P>
The minister was speaking today at the 15th Conference of Ministers
of the Association of Tin Producing Countries underway in Abjua,
capital of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
He said that a team of the staff would in due course be sent to
Pretoria for training, during which they would produce geological maps
of Nigeria using South African facilities and under the guidance of
the staff of geological surveys of that country.
</P>
<P>
But "subsequently, all such maps will be produced here at home," he
said.
</P>
<P>
In consonance with global realities, he said, the Nigerian
government had put in place liberal policies and attractive mining
laws to create conducive environment for the active participation of
private investors for sustainable development of the industry.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, priorities have been given to some of
the country's mineral resources for immediate rehabilitation and
development to meet the requirements of local industries.
</P>
<P>
They include gold, bitumen, baryta, kaolin, gypsum and rock salt.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa Builds Satellite Station for African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The construction of a
satellite station to bring telecommunications to all Africans
started at Hartbeesthoek, west of Pretoria today.
</P>
<P>
Laying the foundation stone for the station, Telecommunications
Minister Jay Naidoo said the new system could bring Africa within
easy reach of the global community.
</P>
<P>
"What we are witnessing here today is the first step in what
promises to be a communications revolution," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Hartbeesthoek station, which costs 30 million U.S.Dollars,
is one of 12 being erected world-wide.
</P>
<P>
The huge project is a result of an agreement signed earlier
between South African Telcom and Ico Global Communications, an
international satellite communication company.
</P>
<P>
South African Telcom Chairman Dikgang Moseneke, who attended
the ceremony, said the satellite station would play a significant
role in improving communications among the people in African
continent.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that satellite phones have the power to change
lives," he said.

<HEADLINE> US-Japan Defense Cooperation Guidelines Published </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The United States and Japan
today published the Guidelines for U.S.-Japan defense cooperation
in an effort to enhance their military alliance.
</P>
<P>
This was announced at a joint press conference here by U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Defense Secretary William
Cohen and their Japanese counterparts, Keizo Obuchi and Fumio
Kyuma, after a bilateral Security Consultative Committee (SCC)
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, also dubbed two plus two, discussed "a variety of
important issues of bilateral concern," including the review of
the Guidelines, according to a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 Guidelines address U.S.-Japan defense cooperation in
three areas: under normal circumstamces; "in response to an armed
attack against Japan and in response to situations in areas
surrounding Japan that have an important influence on Japan's
peace and security."
</P>
<P>
The concept "situations in areas surrounding Japan" "is not
geographic but situational, based on the nature and concept of a
particular contingency rather than its location," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
The revised Guidelines made substantive changes to the 1978
version for cooperation under normal circumstances and during
situations in areas surrounding Japan.
</P>
<P>
During peacetime such items include: peacekeeping, humanitarian
relief and increases in military exchanges, officials of both
countries confirmed.
</P>
<P>
During "situations in areas surrounding Japan," their
cooperation will cover noncombatant evacuation, minesweeping,
search and rescue, rear area support and inspection of ships to
ensure enforcement of economic sanctions, the Guidelines said.
</P>
<P>
The SCC has agreed to start bilateral work immediately under
the new Guidelines by completing basic work for bilateral defense
planning, among others.
</P>
<P>
The geographic areas "surrounding Japan" that the new
Guidelines will cover remain obscure.
</P>
<P>
The enhancement of U.S.-Japan bilateral defense cooperation is
a new development in the post-war era. Other countries in Asia and
the Pacific are watching with concern how the two major military
powers will act to implement their Guidelines.

<HEADLINE> Qian Qichen Meets ROK Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen exchanged views with his Republic of Korea
(ROK) counterpart, Yoo Chong-Ha, today on relations between their
two countries and on regional and international issues.
</P>
<P>
China and the ROK have experienced a rapid development of
relations in the past years thanks to the concern shown by the
leaders of the two countries and the geographical and cultural
links, said Qian when meeting with Yoo at the United Nations
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders are attending the 52nd session of the U.N.
General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Closer relations between the two countries could play an
important role in safeguarding peace and stability in the Korean
Peninsula. China will continue its efforts to promote further
cooperation with the ROK in various fields including economy and
trade, he added.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Yoo said the just concluded 15th National Congress
of the Communist Party of China has laid a strong foundation for
the nation's long-term development.
</P>
<P>
He said the convening of the congress and China's resumption of
exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong have laid a strong basis
for Asian atability which will also give an active impetus to the
development of relations between the ROK and China.
</P>
<P>
On the four-party talks on the Korea issue, Qian noted that it
will conform to the interests of all the parties to establish,
through talks, a peace mechanism and maintain peace and stability
on the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
China hopes that all the parties concerned will continue their
patient consultations to find ways for a settlement of disputes.
</P>
<P>
Yoo said that it is the goal of the ROK government to maintain
peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
China plays a constructive role in the four-party talks, he
said. He hoped China will continue to do so.

<HEADLINE> Automobile Association Calls for Measures to Protect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The American Automobile
Association (AAA) today called for more driver education and
restricted licenses for beginners to reduce the accident toll that
claimed the lives of more than 6,000 teen-age drivers last year.
</P>
<P>
The AAA launched a Licensed to Learn campaign in an effort to
get states to tighten driving requirements for those just
learning.
</P>
<P>
People aged 15 to 20 account for just 7 percent of all drivers,
but they are involved in 14 percent of fatal crashes and 20
percent of all accidents, the association reported. The number of
teen-agers is expected to increase by 25 percent by 2012.
</P>
<P>
Most of those accidents, the AAA said, are caused by
inexperience, poor driving skills, risk-taking and poor
decision-making.
</P>
<P>
Overall, some 6,300 drivers of this age group were killed in
crashes last year in the United States -- one every 84 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The AAA said that studies show the risk of having an accident
declines sharply after someone has three to four years of driving
experience.
</P>
<P>
Some states already have their graduated licensing programs,
but most have not.
</P>
<P>
Graduated licensing programs allow youths to gain experience
and maturity while reducing risk by limiting the situations in
which they can drive.
</P>
<P>
The program urged by the AAA has three stages.

<HEADLINE> 4 Suicide Bombers in Jerusalem Bombings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister's
Office announced here this evening that four of the five suicide
bombers in the Jerusalem bombings have been identified.
</P>
<P>
The announcement said that with the help of the Biology
Laboratory of Forensic Medical Institute of Israel, Israeli
security services have identified four of the five suicide
bombers who conducted the bombings in Jerusalem on July 30 and
September 4.
</P>
<P>
The two bombing attacks claimed 25 lives, including the five
bombers.
</P>
<P>
The security services' evaluation is based on intelligence
data and DNA tests, the announcement said.
</P>
<P>
It gave three bombers' names as Mahmoud Ahmad Jarara, Mahmoud
Asad Zoualha and Ali Mahmoud Yassin. The fourth Bomber, named as
Yosef Ahmad shouli, is still being checked.
</P>
<P>
All the four suicide bombers were residents of the village
Aziraa Shamaliya near Nablus in West Bank, the announcement said.
</P>
<P>
The four were wanted by Israel General Security Services for
their involvement in the shooting attack at vehicles of Israel
Defense Forces near Nablus in 1996, during which an Israeli army
doctor and a soldier were wounded, it said.
</P>
<P>
They were arrested by the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) in 1996, but escaped from prison in Nablus the same year.
</P>
<P>
The announcement said that the four were included in the list
of 88 Hamas and Islamic Jihad (two Palestinian Islamic

<HEADLINE> British Foreign Secretary on UN Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 23 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook urged here today the United Nations to take
more aggressive steps to make itself more efficient,
representative and properly funded.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during the general debate of the 52nd session of the
General Assembly, Cook said that the United Nations should have a
bigger role than ever before. It must modernize. It must be able
to confront the new global challenges all its members face. "It
will need flexibility, competence and efficiency to meet the
complex needs of the 21st century," he said.
</P>
<P>
The British foreign secretary said that his country supports
the commitment of the U.N. secretary general to reform and
modernization. "Without modernizing, the U.N. will lose its
legitimacy and its effectiveness," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that making the U.N. efficient means that the
international organization does the most it can with what it has
got. The members wish to see that the U.N. no longer spends 150
million U.S. dollars producing 2,500 tons of documents every year.
"We thoroughly welcome the secretary-general's commitment to
reduce the number of documents by 25 percent by next year," he
said.
</P>
<P>
On the representativeness, the foreign secretary mainly
referred to the expansion of the Security Council, saying more
countries should be included in the council because the world has
changed. Most of the countries represented here today did not even
exist when the U.N. was formed, he added.
</P>
<P>
Cook also urged the U.N. finances to be put on a sound basis.
"It is not equitable that some members pay their contributions
while others do not. Britain pays in full and on time. Britain
expects every country, however large or however small, to do the
same," he added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the institutional reform, Security Council reform
and financial reform are critical to the U.N.'s future.
</P>
<P>
The British official also called on the international community
to continue the efforts to promote sustainable development,
prevent conflict and combat organized crimes.

NICOSIA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus and Greece today
agreed that Greek navy and air force will join their Cypriot
counterparts in the planned military exercises, code-named
"Nikiforos '97.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at a meeting between the defense
ministers of Cyprus and Greece in Greek capital Athens today,
according to a press release by the official Press and Information
Office.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot Defense Minister Costas Eliades and his Greek
counterpart Akis Tsohatzopoulos exchanged views on initiatives
taken within the framework of an existing defense cooperation
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus and Greece signed in 1993 the defense agreement under
which the Greek armed forces will provide Cyprus with assistance
in case the island is attacked.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers also discussed the details of the exercises
due to be launched in October in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The press release said the military exercises will take place
irrespective of the peace talks, expected to start Friday, between
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed coup by the Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared in 1983 a breakaway "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus" recognized only by Turkey, which
deploys 35,000 troops in northern Cyprus.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Takes Part in Consideration of UN Reform Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria would actively
participate in the consideration of the UN reform plans proposed
by Secretary-General Kofi Annan, said Tom Ikimi, foreign minister
of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, here today.
</P>
<P>
But the foreign minister stressed the outcome of the reform
should encompass and take on board the views and interests of all
member states.
</P>
<P>
He said the reform of the UN would be incomplete without a
corresponding reform of the Security Council. A reform of the
Security Council would entail a restructuring and expansion of its
membership in both categories to take account of the interested
membership of the organization and the need to reflect the
interests of all the constituent region.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said there was now abroad agreement on the
need for the expansion of membership of the Security Council in
both categories. With almost a third of the membership of the
United Nations, Africa should have adequate representation in an
expanded Security Council.
</P>
<P>
He said that at the 33rd Summit of the Organization of African
Unity held last June, leaders of Africa reaffirmed the need for
the region to have two permanent seats with full veto powers, and
Nigeria considered this demand legitimate and well deserved.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said there were conflict situations in
Africa which had threatened the security and stabilization and the
economic development of the region.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that urgent demands of socio-economic development
could not be effectively tackled without peace and stability, and
peace as well as stability in Africa would facilitate the
channeling of its limited resources into the critical areas of
political, social and economic development.

WASHINGTON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- A newly unsealed grand
jury indictment in Sacramento, California, charges 16 men with
operating a drug ring in the Far West.
</P>

<P>
Eight of the 16 defendants have pleaded guilty in the case, and
all of them face maximum sentences of life imprisonment if
convicted, with a mandatory minimum of not less than 10 years.

JERUSALEM, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Palestinian
students held a demonstration in East Jerusalem today to protest
against the Jewish settlement in the Ras Al-Amud area in the city.
</P>
<P>
The protesters threw stones at Israeli police and were then
dispersed. No one was hurt.
</P>
<P>
Three Jewish families occupied two houses in Arab-dominated Ras
Al-Amud area ten days ago and left last Thursday after reaching
agreement with the government amid uproar by Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Then ten Jewish seminary students moved into the houses and
were joined at night by ten security staff as per the arrangement
by the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
But local Arab residents are still against this move, saying
the nature of replacing the Jewish settlers with students is just
the same, that is to reinforce Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Several Palestinian and Islamic institutions made a joint
decision here today to establish a central committee to monitor

<HEADLINE> Most European Shares down on Dull Wall Street </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
ended mixed Tuesday, with both London and Paris losing all their
early gains and closing down, depressed by a dull Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 index in London had climbed to 5,095.1, within a
whisker of the 5,095.3 August 7 life high, before ending sharply
down near the session's lows as weakness on Wall Street weighed on
sentiment. The index closed at 5,027.5, down 48.2 points.
</P>
<P>
Fears of another rate rise also depressed the market following
the release of stronger-than-expected UK GDP growth rate in the
second quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
French shares in Paris once again fell below the key
3,000-point level as profit-taking spread across the market
following Monday's gains, with the CAC-40 index down 21.64 points
lower at 2,995.81.
</P>
<P>
However, in Frankfurt, Shares ended firmer but off highs as the
market failed to sustain its advance above the 4,100-level.
</P>
<P>
The DAX-30 index was 9.28 points up at 4,098.20 by the close. A
firmer dollar boosted chemical and auto stocks.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Official Meets Ross on Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- A senior Israeli official
held talks on Tuesday with U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross
ahead of an Israeli-Palestinian meeting in Washington for a
possible solution of recent crisis in the region.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh told reporters after his
talks with Ross that they came to Washington to seek to "put the
peace process back on track."
</P>
<P>
Naveh will meet Palestinian officials here at the State
Department late this week.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian talks on peace process were deadlocked
since March when the Israeli government, violating peace accords
agreed both by Israel and the Palestinians, decided to build
Jewish housing units in Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright took a trip to the Middle
East early this month, trying to re-vitalize the peace process,
and returned with nothing settled concerning the crisis.
</P>
<P>
But she has arranged for Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy
and Palestinian negotiator Mahmoud Abbas to meet in New York next
week, hoping the two sides could re-open their peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Naveh, did not mention the real cause for the recent crisis in
the region, and what responsibility should be taken on the Israeli
side. He only blamed the Palestinian Authority for its slackening
of effort in fighting "terrorism."
</P>
<P>
"We don't see there are real results from (Palestinian leader
Yasser) Arafat's fight against terrorism. Since Secretary
Albright's trip there has been a deterioration in his efforts," he
complained.
</P>
<P>
Israeli diplomats in Washington said a joint U.S.-Israeli
committee on counter-terrorism would discuss the situation at
a meeting here on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> German Post Workers Protest against Liberalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 23 (Xinhua) -- About 10,000 employees of
Germany's state-run post company, the Deutsche Post AG, laid down
their jobs today in protest against a government plan to
liberalize the post services.
</P>
<P>
According to the German trade union for post workers DPG,
million of letters and parcels had not been delivered today across
Germany due to the protests. In many cities, counters of post
offices had also been kept closed on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the liberalization plan proposed by German Post Minister
Wolfgang Boetsch, the Deutsche Post AG would only be able to
retain its monopoly of post deliveries of up to 100 gram until
2002. After that deadline, private operators would be allowed to
compete with the state-run company in all post services.
</P>
<P>
The trade union however fears that the initiative would lead to
about 10,000 job cuts.
</P>
<P>
Although the new post law is still under discussion in Bonn,
Boetsch said he was confident that it would be approved by the
German parliament within this year and would come into effect
on January 1, 1998.

BONN, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Expanding domestic demand would
replace exports as the primary driving force for Germany's
economic growth next year, a leading German economic research
institute predicted today.

<HEADLINE> France Reacts With "Abomination" to Massacres in Algeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- France reacted to the latest
massacres in Algeria with "abomination" and the French society was
struck with horror on learning the massacre of more than 200
civilians in Bentalha south of Algiers Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Personalities from both the ruling Socialist Party and the
central-right UDF opposition party of France expressed their
feeling of horror over the massacre and said the international
community and the European Union should break their silence over
Algeria.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine today expressed his
"feeling of revulsion in front of the horrors suffered by the
Algerian people and a feeling of profound solidarity" toward the
Algerian people.
</P>
<P>
"After so many atrocities and intolerable crimes committed in
Algeria, this new act of barbarity greatly upset us and struck us
with horror," said French Foreign Ministry spokesman Yves
Doutriaux.
</P>
<P>
The latest killing in Bentalha is the second most bloody in
Algeria since 1992, after the massacre of 300 civilians in Sidi
Rais on August 29. The Algerian government gave much smaller
accounts of victims.
</P>
<P>
"In front of these tragic events, the French society expresses
its entire solidarity with the Algerian people. It reacts with
abomination to the violence and the terrorism which have plunged
Algeria into mourning," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Algerian people have the "legitimate right to
be protected," and repeated France's stand that the conflict in
Algeria should be solved through political means by Algerians
themselves.
</P>
<P>
On the latest announcement by the Islamic Salvation Army, the
armed wing of the Islamic Salvation Army, to start a cease-fire
with the government from October 1, the spokesman said that the
French government is yet to "study it."
</P>
<P>
The French government has been carrying out a "minimalist"
policy toward Algeria by refraining from making official comments
on the violence in the country, out of fear of terrorist attacks
in France.
</P>
<P>
French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said in a recent interview
with the daily Le Monde that "in the official field, the French
government is restrained in its expression" about Algeria.
</P>
<P>
The daily Le Figaro said that both the presidential advisors in
the Elysee Palace and the Foreign Ministry are strictly for a low
profile policy by France toward Algeria.
</P>
<P>
About 60 French nationals have been killed in Algeria since
1992 and the French capital of Paris and the central city of Lyon
were subjected to a wave of terrorist bombings in 1995, assumably
by Islamic extremists.
</P>
<P>
A French diplomat noted that the historical and close relations
between France and Algeria and the 600,000-strong Algerian
community in France call for a very careful policy by France.
</P>
<P>
Extreme-right National Front (FN) leader Jean-Marie Le Pen said
today that "Arab and Muslim countries are more qualified" to
interfere in Algeria than France, if there is a need to interfere.

<HEADLINE> Time for India, Pakistan to Forget Past: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The time has come when
India and Pakistan should forget the past, sink their differences
and come to an agreement for lasting peace, the Press Trust of
India today quoted an Indian official as saying.
</P>
<P>
The money and energy being spent in both countries due to
continuous hostility could be saved and utilized for the welfare
of the people, India-held Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Farooq
Abdullah said on Tuesday while addressing a group of senior army
officers of the National Defense College in Srinagar.
</P>
<P>
The group, which also include officers of various countries,
are touring the country.
</P>
<P>
People of both countries have suffered immensely due to
hostility, Abdullah said.
</P>
<P>
India and Pakistan have fought three wars since their
independence in 1947, of which two were over the disputed Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
However, the two countries have intensified their efforts to
solve their differences this year.
</P>
<P>
At the end of March, they resumed the foreign secretary-level
talks, which had been stalled for nearly three years, and three
rounds of talks have been held since then.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the Indian and Pakistani foreign ministers held two
rounds of informal talks here in April and their prime ministers
also met for talks in May and September.
</P>
<P>
Both sides have expressed their determination to continue their
dialogue so as to normalize their ties.

Provinces only, has dropped dramatically to just over
1,000.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Car Makers Plan Production Boost in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Two Japanese automakers
plan to build additional factories in North America to increase
pressure on U.S. car manufacturers, The Wall Street Journal
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. each plan to build an
assembly plant in the United States or Canada but potential sites
were not disclosed, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Toyota also intends to double its capacity to 200,000 vehicles
a year at a truck factory still under construction in Indiana.
</P>
<P>
If the plans are realized, the Japanese automaker would be able
to produce 1.5 million cars and small trucks in the U.S. per year
early in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
Toyota's capacity in the country had increased to about 785,000
vehicles annually by last year.
</P>
<P>
Honda, meanwhile, plans to increase production by about 100,000
vehicles a year, the Journal reported. Honda's capacity in North
America is now about 790,000.
</P>
<P>
The added production by both companies would make their
combined North American annual output about 2.5 million vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Toyota executives said they are simply responding to dealer
pressure for more cars. But a Honda spokesman denied claims by
sources who told the Journal about the company's North American
expansion plan.
</P>
<P>
In the first eight months of this year, the share of Japanese
vehicles in the U.S. market increased to 23.9 percent from the
22.5 percent in the same period of last year. While the share of
the Big Three in the U.S. declined to 71.3 percent from 73.2
percent in the eight months of 1996, according to the auto
statistics released earlier this month.

<HEADLINE> Rising Sea Levels Assessed on European Coastline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The European Union
publication European Report today issued an assessment report on
rising sea levels based on several European community research
projects.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that the rising sea levels are likely caused
by melting glaciers in the wake of global warming. It warned that
three Celsius degrees' up in the year of 2070 could result in an
average increase of 40 centimeters in sea levels.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary to develop instruments for constant and
accurate monitoring of sea levels, the report claimed.
</P>
<P>
As many as 68 million Europeans living along the coastline may
be threatened by rising sea levels that go up at a rate of one to
1.5 millimeters a year.
</P>
<P>
Changes in sea levels are considered to exert tremendous
influences on the development of coastal areas in Europe,
particularly on regions where the social and economic
repercussions are likely to be most important.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Steps Up Efforts to Cope With Haze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia has stepped up
efforts to cope with the haze from forest fires raging in several
islands in the country, a senior official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The efforts include the evacuation of haze victims and the use
of information technology as well as meteorological and
geophysical data to help extinguish the fires, State Minister for
Environment Sarwono Kusumaatmadja said.
</P>
<P>
"Now it is not the time to blame each other. It is important to
realize that if we ignore environment-related information, the
consequences could be fatal," he said, referring to the disaster.
</P>
<P>
A prolonged drought and the slash-and-burn method used by many
plantation companies to open land have triggered forest fires in
Kalimantan, Sumatra, Irian Jaya, Bali and Sulawesi, producing the
haze that has already reached neighboring countries like Malaysia
and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Forestry Minister Djamaloedin Suryohadikusumo said Indonesia
has allocated funds amounting to 3.1 billion rupiah (1.07 million
U.S. dollars) and mobilized 8,437 skilled people for efforts to
put out the fires.
</P>
<P>
Data showed that more than 400,000 hectares of forest areas had
been destroyed in the fires between mid-August and September 19,
the minister added.
</P>
<P>
The government is using the satellites of the U.S. National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Outerspace
and Aviation Agency in its effort to detect fire spots.
</P>
<P>
"The government has information on the location of fire spots
throughout Indonesia and we send it twice a day to all provinces
so that the local governments could act quickly to extinguish the
fires," an official of the Environmental Impact Management Agency,
Gempur Adnan, said.
</P>
<P>
Minister Sarwono further said other preventive measures could
be the evacuation of people to safer areas.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, there have been offers of assistance from
abroad in combating the haze.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,200 Malaysian firefighters and paramedics arrived
in separate locations Tuesday in Riau, Jambi, South Sumatra, East
Kalimantan and West Kalimantan provinces to join their Indonesian
counterparts in fighting the raging fires.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said the haze has exposed 20 million people to
the danger of respiratory problems in the country and in Malaysia
and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Two persons have already died of respiratory ailments blamed on
the haze.

BONN, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion Boris Becker
was ousted from the Grand Slam Cup tennis tournament when he lost
to Swden Jonas Bjorkman 6-3, 6-2 in Munich on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Becker lost a 3-1 lead in the opening set and was never able to
get back into contention against the 25-year-old Scandinavian, who
now ranks at 13th in the world.
</P>
<P>
Despite a lack of Grand Slam results in 1997, organisers gave
the 29-year-old Becker a wild card entry into the 16-man field,
mainly as a crowd-puller.
</P>
<P>
But his hopes were dashed in just 68 minutes as Becker lost the
first set and went down and out by losing serve three times in the
second, error-plagued set despite an early break-back against the
Swede.
</P>
<P>
Australia's new US Open champion Pat Rafter, meanwhile, came
though in straight sets to oust Austrian Thomas Muster 6-2, 6-3
for a quarter-final spot.

<HEADLINE> Indigenisation Urged to Reduce Poverty in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 24 (Xinhua) -- A Zimbabwean minister of
state today underscored the need to use the indigenisation of the
economy as an effective tool of reducing poverty in the country.
</P>
<P>
Cephas Msipa, state Enterprises and Indigenisation Minister,
said economic empowerment of the majority should be treated as a
national program to improve the lives of people who were
discriminated on racial grounds by previous colonial governments.
</P>
<P>
"Indigenisation is a crucial and indeed an almost
indispensable aspect in poverty reduction in Zimbabwe," he said.
</P>
<P>
Msipa was addressing more than 50 participants here at an
indigenisation and poverty reduction seminar organised by the
Zimbabwe Institute of Development Studies.
</P>
<P>
Increased economic growth through the creation of more
enterprises would translate into more national income which, if
distributed equally, would be key in poverty reduction, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Let us all dedicate ourselves to pursue all strategies that
will result not only in the reduction but elimination of poverty
in Zimbabwe," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, poverty was very high in both rural
and urban areas, a situation "politically and socially
unacceptable particularly in a country which is endowed with an
abundance of resources."
</P>
<P>
Msipa noted that efforts by entrepreneurs in the informal
sector to break into big business were hampered by reasons
ranging from financial to restrictive laws and by-laws.
</P>
<P>
The government was promoting other initiatives such as
affirmative action in its procurement of goods and services,
sub-contracting and employee stock ownership plans, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister said these programs should be aided by
easy access to information for people intending to start
businesses.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, the government, in conjunction with other
business organisations, was considering establishing business
information centers in all major towns and rural centers.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier, Kazakh President Hold Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA-ATA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng and
Kazakh President Nursultan Abishevich Nazarbayev held talks here
today, pledging joint efforts in furthering bilateral relations,
particularly economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Li, who is here on a working visit, said the success of China
National Petroleum Corporation in the bid in two petroleum
projects in Kazakhstan marks the start of major economic and trade
cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
As long as the two countries work closely together, their
cooperation in petroleum sector can make progress and set an
example for the cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual
benefit.
</P>
<P>
Li and Nazarbayev expressed satisfaction over the "smooth
development" of bilateral relations since the two countries
established diplomatic ties five years ago, saying that such
relations have entered a "brand new period" and seen "immense
potentials."
</P>
<P>
Li said the two countries have had frequent exchanges and
cooperation in all areas and maintained the exchange of high-level
visits, thus increasing mutual understanding.
</P>
<P>
China and Kazakhstan signed several documents including a joint
declaration, an agreement on confidence-building in the military
field and an agreement on disarmament in the past years, Li said.
</P>
<P>
These documents demonstrate the friendly relations between the
two nations, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two countries can use their geographical and
mutually-supplementary advantages to gradually raise their
economic cooperation to a high level.
</P>
<P>
Nazarbayev said Kazakhstan highly values the visit of Premier
Li. He described the oil agreement signed by the two countries as
a "cross-century" document which is of "great importance" to the
development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Nazarbayev also extended congratulations on the smooth return
of Hong Kong and the successful convening of the 15th National
Congress of the Communist Party of China.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing was present at the talks.

<HEADLINE> Developing Nations Favor Gradual Capital Liberalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from
developing countries today called on the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) to adopt a manner of gradual progress in promoting the
liberalization of capital movement so as to prevent possible
financial crises in these countries.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Massad, governor of the Fund for Chile, told the World
Bank /IMF Annual Meetings here that the representatives of the
Latin American countries had clearly expressed their willingness
to extend the IMF's mandate to enable it to promote liberalization
 of capital accounts in its member countries.
</P>
<P>
But Massad quickly added that precipitate liberalization would
create new financial crises with a spillover to other countries
resulting from the contagion effect.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement adopted by the Interim Committee of
the IMF on September 21, the jurisdiction of the IMF was extended
to enable it to promote the liberalization of capital movement.
</P>
<P>
One of the most important aspects of the future regime is the
treatment of prudential measures, Massad said.
</P>
<P>
"Owing to the structural characteristics of the economies of
our region -- mostly small open economies requiring external
resources and with insufficiently diversified exports -- they are
highly vulnerable to external shocks," he said.
</P>
<P>
At the meetings, an Egyptian representative, on behalf of the
Arab countries, said the recent financial problems in many
emerging markets are largely the result of the increased
globalization of these markets.
</P>
<P>
In order to obtain the maximum benefit from globalization and
to minimize its negative effects, many developing countries have
implemented a series of sound economic reforms, accompanied by
comprehensive structural reforms, said Atef Ebeid, the Egyptian
privatization minister.
</P>
<P>
But these measures alone are not sufficient, as recent
developments in Southeast Asia have shown, he added.
</P>
<P>
Even countries that follow sound economic policies are not safe
from effects of financial disturbances in the region, Ebeid said.
</P>
<P>
It is important for the IMF and World Bank to provide technical
assistance to developing countries to support their efforts aimed
at integrating themselves into the new world order, he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Aircraft to Help Put Out Indonesian Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian government
has decided to send Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF) aircraft such
as "Charlie" to help put out the fires in Indonesia, a Malaysian
official said today.
</P>
<P>
National Disaster Relief Management Committee Chairman Mohamed
Rahmat said the RMAF had been informed of this duty and the
aircraft would be sent immediately.
</P>
<P>
"The aircraft will be equipped with the necessary equipment to
enable them to release water from the air on the burning areas,"
he was quoted by the Malaysian national news agency Bernama as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,200 Malaysian firefighters are already in Sumatra of
Indonesia to help extinguish the forest fires which have resulted
in thick haze affecting neighboring Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei
and now the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed said more firefighting personnel would leave for
Pontianak and Balikpapan in Kalimantan early next week.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's efforts to help Indonesia control its forest fires
has received the support of nine companies involved in land
development in Sumatra and Kalimantan, he said.
</P>
<P>
Due to the haze, the air quality over the Malaysian city of
Kuching on the Kalimantan Island remained far above the hazardous
level today while elsewhere in the country it was at very
unhealthy or unhealthy levels, according to a statement by the
Environment Department.

<HEADLINE> Iran Able to Locate All Air Violations: Officer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Iran's lookouts are now fully
prepared to identify and locate enemy aircraft even if they fly at
low altitude and blind spots, an officer said today.
</P>
<P>
Qasem Rahimian, head of the State Air Observation, told the
press that lookouts have been stationed at blind spots, where
aircraft can not be detected on radar, to check low-level air
operations of enemies.
</P>
<P>
Rahimian, an officer in charge of the observation post at
Zulfaqar region, about 150 kilometers south of Tehran, said that
such observation posts should be permanently stationed along
border areas where natural barriers prevent radar from detecting
and locating aircraft.
</P>
<P>
He said that vessel traveling, air flights and launching of
long-range missiles of the enemy were detected by the lookouts
during the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq War.
</P>
<P>
The officer also underlined the need for collaboration of
academic centers, adding that mutual cooperation could pave the
way for improving the operations of observation, radar and air
defense systems.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the English language daily Tehran Times today
commented that the maneuvers being held in the Zulfaqar area aims
to keep the effectiveness of the Iranian armed forces as high
as possible.
</P>
<P>
It noted that enhancing Iranian army combat readiness should
not be seen as a threat to Iran's friends and neighbors, adding
that "Iran will never be the first country to fire the first
bullet toward its neighbors, but will always be ready to face the
aggressors with an Iron fist."
</P>
<P>
The maneuvers held by the Iranian army, together with Iranian
naval and air forces in the Gulf and Caspian Sea are in honor of
the Defense Week starting from September 22, which commemorates
the Iran-Iraq War.

CANBERRA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The Australian government
today said it has called on Hong Kong authorities to investigate
three containers of potentially hazardous Australian computer
scrap seized by Hong Kong customs.
</P>
<P>
The government has asked Hong Kong's Environmental Protection
Department to examine the containers allegedly shipped from Sydney
without a permit, a spokesman for Environment Minister Robert Hill
said.
</P>
<P>
Environment watchdog Greenpeace claimed that HiTechnology Metal
Recyclers (HMR) exported the scrap aboard the freighter Zim Sydney
on September 12, the Australian Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
The shipment showed that Australia was still dumping hazardous
material on developing countries despite insisting that stringent
laws had stopped the practice, Greenpeace charged.
</P>
<P>
It said the scrap contained lead cadmium, barium, mercury and
polychlorinated bophenyls (PCBs).
</P>
<P>
But HMR Assistant Manager Guy Channery denied his company had
shipped the load to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that HMR had sold some "material" to another
company, which he refused to name and which he said had shipped
the material overseas to a "destination we don't know."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the government had not yet been notified by
Hong Kong as to whether the load was hazardous.

situation has begun to improve, and called for more foreign
investments.
</P>
<P>
The country's financial market remains stable and very strong,

"We estimate that the (economic) situation has begun to

<P>
Chubais stressed that his country welcomes a flow of long-term
capital to be started in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Russia has gold-currency reserves of about 800 million
U.S. dollars, and the Russian government is capable of controlling
the currency's exchange rate, he said.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation between Russia and the World Bank and the IMF has
improved significantly with good prospects, he stated.
</P>
<P>
"We are satisfied with the IMF-World Bank interaction in the
area of structural reforms," he said, adding that the cooperation
"helps to restore economic growth and to maintain macroeconomic
stability" in Russia.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the recent financial turmoil in Southeast Asia,
Russian Central Bank Chief Sergei Dubinin stressed the need at the
 news conference for every country to enhance its own financial
system.
</P>
<P>
He said that Russia is eager to strengthen its control over the

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Central Government
departments agree that taking Deng Xiaoping Theory as the
guiding ideology, an important part of the 15th National Congress
of the Communist Party of China (CPC), is the will and common
aspiration of the Party and the people.
</P>
<P>
A campaign to study the Congress documents has been started in
central government departments. At the General Office of the State
Council and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Party members and
officials say that the theory about the primary stage of socialism
is the cornerstone of Deng Xiaoping Theory.
</P>
<P>
The reform of state enterprises remains a major topic among
departments officials, who say that General Secretary Jiang
Zemin's report at the Congress states that public ownership can
and should find expression in diverse forms, and that the
distribution system allows and encourages the use of capital and
technology to become involved income distribution.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the State Science and Technology Commission and
Education Commission say that they were encouraged by Jiang's
emphasis on invigorating China by means of science and
education, something that clearly defines the status of education
as a developmental priority.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Supreme People's Court, the Supreme People's
Procuratorate, the Ministry of Public Security, and the Ministry
of Justice expressed a determination to help introduce a socialist
legal system, to govern the country according to the law, and to
make a contribution to China's stability.

Theory as the guiding ideology of the CPC. It also elected a new
CPC leadership with Jiang Zemin at the core.
</P>
<P>
He said that China's armed forces are determined to hold high
the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory and to unite more closely
around the CPC Central Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core, to

Party National Congress which defined the direction of China's

<P>
BEIJING, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Gen. Chi Haotian, China's
vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission and defense
minister, meeting today with Gen. Dennis Reimer, US Army Chief of
Staff, said that the upcoming Sino-US summit in Washington will be
the focus of the world.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin's visit, scheduled for October, is an
important event in Sino-US relations, Chi said, noting that
 the meeting between President Jiang and President Bill Clinton
last November brought Sino-US ties to a new development period.
</P>
<P>
The US is the largest developed country and China the largest
developing one, the two are playing an important role in the world

of the people of both countries, and will help safeguard peace and
stability in the world, he said.
</P>
<P>
With the development of Sino-US ties, relations between the two
armed forces have become stronger, he said, adding that he
believes that Reimer's visit will contribute to the further
development of relations.
</P>
<P>
Reimer said that the visit will help him to forge closer ties
with his Chinese counterpart and better understand China.
</P>
<P>
He had a frank and in-depth discussion with Kui Fulin, deputy
Chief of General Staff of the PLA, yesterday, and that the two
sides agreed that there is more in common than the differences
between them.
</P>
<P>
The two armed forces should continue the exchange of visits, he
said, to enhance understanding and build on this common
ground. The two sides should make more efforts to help make the
world safer, he added.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Uganda Becomes No. One Coffee Producer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has surpassed Cote
d'Ivoire to become Africa's leading coffee producer, harvesting
about 4.2 million bags (60 kilos per bag) of coffee in the
1996/97 season.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Managing Director of the Uganda Coffee
Development Authority (UCDA) T.N. Bucyanayandi here on Tuesday
while briefing the Parliamentary Committee on Trade and Industry
about the coffee sector in relation to the national budget.
</P>
<P>
And this (1996/97 coffee season) is the second year that
Uganda exports over 4 million bags of coffee, he said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 4.15 million bags were exported in 1995/96 coffee
season, compared to 2.79 million bags in the previous year, he
added.
</P>
<P>
With last year's production, Uganda took the lead from Cote
d'Ivoire which produced 2.7 million bags in 1995/96 and about 3.7
million bags this coffee season.
</P>
<P>
Coffee has been Uganda's biggest foreign exchange earner
covering 65 percent of the country's export income.
</P>
<P>
The significant rise of coffee production or exports in recent
years is attributed to a number of measures taken by the Ugandan
government in a bid to promote its coffee production.
</P>
<P>
The government has set up three task forces to review coffee
production, marketing and export systems, and based on their
recommendations, the UCDA has revised its relevant regulations
concerning coffee production and export so as to make them more
responsive to coffee industry.
</P>
<P>
Privatization of the coffee nurseries has been initiated to
increase the production of coffee seedlings so as to speed up
replacement of low yielding coffee trees at reasonable costs to
farmers.
</P>
<P>
With the introduction of the prolific clonal coffee, Uganda's
coffee production has increased by a wide margin. The clonal
coffee has an yielding capacity of three tons per hectare
compared to the robusta coffee with an yield of 1.2 tons per
hectare.
</P>
<P>
The coffee retention system introduced by the world's coffee
producing countries in October 1993 and the liberalization of
export system have also contributed to the sharp rise of coffee
earnings in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The retention system has helped the rise of coffee price from
84 U.S. Cents to 2 Dollars per kilogram since African coffee
producers adopted in August 1993 a new policy which stipulates a
20 percent reduction of coffee exports.
</P>
<P>
Liberalization of the export system has removed export
monopoly of the Coffee Marketing Board Ltd. and over 80 companies
in the country have been licensed to export coffee.
</P>
<P>
As a result, farmers in Uganda can earn between 60 percent and
70 percent of the world price, or about 1.4 Dollars per kilogram
from a mere 20 percent before liberalization.
</P>
<P>
The Uganda Coffee Farmers' Association has decided to double
the country's current annual coffee production of 4.2 million
bags during the years 1996-2001 and introduce appropriate
measures to this end.

<HEADLINE> Free Capital Flow, No Blame for Currency Crisis: Singapore Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's Finance
Minister Richard Hu said here today that the flow of capital
should not be blamed for the recent currency turbulence in
Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
"The greatest lesson Asia can learn from the financial turmoil
is the opening up of the world capital market," said Hu, who is
here attending the 1997 Annual Meetings of the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua at the Hong Kong Convention and
Exhibition Center today, the Singaporean official said: "There are
pluses and minors in opening the capital market."
</P>
<P>
The negative side is volatility while the positive picture is
the inflow of foreign investment, explained Hu, who has been
working in the Finance Ministry for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
"The solution is not to close the markets completely," he said,
adding that the way-out is how to use the money efficiently to
generate income.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Thailand, which was hit hardest in the Southeast
Asia currency crisis, Hu said: "Don't blame entirely on the
capital market. The capital market allowed this (crisis) to
happen, but if you cut it off, you also cut off the advantages."
</P>
<P>
In his view, the reason behind the collapse of the Thai
currency market is that all the economic fundamentals became weak
at the same time -- declining export competitiveness, large
current account deficit, insufficient infrastructure, too much
short-term external loans being put into unproductive projects.
</P>
<P>
The IMF has launched a rescue package of 17.2 billion U.S.
dollars to bail out the beleaguered Thai economy. "It is a
question of restoring the fundamentals," said Hu.
</P>
<P>
The Singaporean minister did not think that the currency
turmoil would put an end to the "Asia Miracle", a term
describing the region's up to ten percent annual GDP growth over
the past decade.
</P>
<P>
"The Asian fundamentals have not changed. The trouble is that
they have been going a little fast without slowing down to provide
the infrastructure which is necessary to sustain long growth," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Asia has natural resources, well-educated labor, high savings,
market-oriented and opening policies, and all it needs is a good
and necessary pause to regain strength, he went on. "This slowdown
in fact may be good for Asia."

MOSCOW, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak completed his three-day official visit to Moscow today

documents on cooperation in the political, economic,
legal, investment and other spheres.

BEIJING, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Fu Quanyou, chief of the
general staff of the People's Liberation Army, meeting today with
Mauro Cesar Rodrigues Pereira, Brazil's Naval Minister, said that
Pereira's visit will play an active role in promoting friendly
exchanges and co-operation between the two countries' armed forces.
</P>
<P>
He said that during the recent 15th National Congress of the

and a concrete action of China to safeguard stability and peace in
the region and the world.

China's armed forces will resolutely carry out the decision, he
said, and will implement Deng Xiaoping's ideas on developing the
army and follow Jiang Zemin's general requirements for
building the military.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Weather Currency Storm Sooner: Ramos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- President Fidel Ramos
expressed confidence here today that the Philippines will weather
sooner than expected the currency turbulence which swept across
Southeast Asia for the last few months.
</P>
<P>
The country not only continued to attract investors, but also
retained businessmen's confidence in the country's economy despite
the devaluation of the peso in the last few months, Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
According to a report to the president, investments in the
country reached 587.9 billion pesos (18.4 billion U.S. dollars) in
the first eight months this year, exceeding the 550 billion peso
(about 17 billion dollars) target for the whole year.
</P>
<P>
The revenue of the export sector soared to 13.77 billion
dollars from January to July this year with an average growth rate
of 22.1 percent per month, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Buoyed by the positive developments in the economy, especially
the continuing influx of investments and the satisfactory
performance of exports, Ramos said the country would soon weather
the currency woes also hitting Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The value of the peso has fallen by 28 percent to the present
level of 33.63 pesos to one U.S. dollar since the central bank
allowed the currency to float within a wider band on July 11.
</P>
<P>
To cushion the impact of the currency meltdown, Ramos today
created a special task force to undertake consultations.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said the creation of the task force was only one of the
many issues discussed at a cabinet meeting on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Other decisions reached by the cabinet included: to reduce the
current account deficit, to ensure a balanced monetary and
exchange rate policy, to continue prudent fiscal management and to
close the gap between private savings and investments, he said.

<HEADLINE> Developed Nations Urged to Increase Aid to Developing World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Developing countries today
urged the industrialized nations to honor their commitment to
increase official development assistance (ODA) to the developing
world.
</P>
<P>
"We deeply regret the steady decline in official development
assistance," Ethiopian Finance Minister Sufian Ahmed told the
annual meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund
(IMF).
</P>
<P>
"This decline makes it difficult for our countries to
successfully complete the ambitious reform programs being
implemented in the priority areas of our economies," he added.
</P>
<P>
At the meetings, Pakistan also expressed its concern about the
sharp decline in the net official flows to developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz said it was unfortunate
the ODA target of 0.7 percent of GNP set some two decades ago
remains a far cry and that in case of many donor countries there
is a persistent decline in their share of GNP devoted to
assistance to developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Private capital flows are no substitute for concessional
assistance because the former are directed towards profitable
commercial ventures in fast growing economies, while the latter is
needed for building human capital and for alleviating poverty in a
large number of low-income nations, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Quality growth can not be achieved and sustained without more
rapid progress in social sectors, he said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim said that it is
disturbing to note that ODA to developing countries continues to
decline despite evidence of rising poverty in many countries.
</P>
<P>
"I therefore urge donor countries to renew their commitment to
ODA through a smart partnership between donors and recipients," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Group of 24 composed of developing countries said in a
communique issued here that the percentage of ODA of the GNP in
the developed countries had been in steady decline over the past
50 years and hit its nadir last year.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the amount of ODA dropped to 41 billion U.S. dollars,
a reduction of 20.7 percent compared with the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Okinawa Officials Criticize New Japan-U.S. Guidelines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Government officials in Japan's
Okinawa Prefecture criticized today the new guidelines for
Japan-U.S. defence cooperation and demanded a reduction of the
U.S. bases in the island, Kyodo reported.
</P>
<P>
There are fears about the effect of the U.S. use of the
prefecture's air and sea ports on the economic activities and
people's life and property in the prefecture, Okinawa Governor
Mashihide Ota said.
</P>
<P>
Under the new guidelines, Japan will allow the U.S. military
forces to use its civilian air and sea ports in case of emergency
near Japan.
</P>
<P>
Ota made it clear that he will continue asking Washington to
restructure and reduce the bases, and to prevent them from being
made permanent.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Naha Mayor Kosei Oyadomari said that the
inclusion of Naha, capital of Okinawa, in the list of civilian
facilities to be used by the U.S, forces, had shocked his city.
</P>
<P>
Okinawa Mayor Shusei Arakawa said the review of the 1978
guidelines for Japan-U.S. defence cooperation was in effect a
review of the Japan-U.S. security treaty, which not only secures
the continued presence of the U.S. bases but also "leads to a
substantial strengthening of the bases of Japan's Self-Defense
Forces."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, "It is necessary to have a national debate
on the guidelines."
</P>
<P>
The new guidelines, issued in New York on Tuesday, have spurred
wide criticism from the Japanese opposition.

<HEADLINE> Two Aussie Ministers Quit Over Travel Allowance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The Australian federal
government today plunged into its deepest crisis with two key
ministers forced to resign over revelations about travel allowance
claims.
</P>
<P>
Transport Minister John Sharp and Administrative Services
Minister David Jull resigned less than 24 hours after it was made
public that Sharp had secretly paid back 6,292 U.S. dollars in
questionable claims.
</P>
<P>
Sharp, who repaid the money after voluntarily correcting his
claims for travel allowance, said he quit to avoid embarrassing
and distracting the government.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "I believe there was no impropriety."
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Howard, who accepted their resignations,
ordered an urgent inquiry into Sharp's claims and Jull's
no-questions-asked acceptance of the repayment when details of
claims were about to be tabled in the parliament in May, the
Australian Associated Press (AAP) reported.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said he acted swiftly, after first learning
of the issue last weekend, to uphold the high standards he
promised at the last election.
</P>
<P>
Howard said he had no alternative, even though he did not
believe the two men acted improperly or dishonestly.
</P>
<P>
The resignations have brought to six the number of ministers
and parliamentary secretaries forced to quit under a cloud since
the Howard government won office in March 1996.
</P>
<P>
Records show that in 1994 and 1995 Sharp consistently claimed
travel allowance for staying in Canberra on Sunday and Thursday
nights at the start and end of parliamentary sessions.
</P>
<P>
Most of the repaid claims for 1996 were also for Sunday and
Thursday nights, with Sharp admitting that he could not be sure
whether he was actually at home.
</P>
<P>
Two other ministers were also revealed today to have repaid
some travel allowance claims after records were made public in
May, AAP said.
</P>
<P>
Veterans Affairs Minister Bruce Scott has repaid 1,234 U.S.
dollars and Science Minister Peter McGaruan 4,550 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said he was satisfied with the explanations
from the two ministers.
</P>
<P>
Three former government ministers -- Geoff Prosser, Jim Short
and Brian Gibson -- have been forced to resign over the past 18
months, all falling foul of conflicts between private interest and
public duty. There was no suggestion of impropriety.
</P>
<P>
Senator Mal Colston was also forced to quit as deputy president
of the Senate earlier this year for the same reason.

<HEADLINE> UEFA Decide on New Arbitration Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, September 24 (Xinhua) -- European soccer's governing
body UEFA voted unanimously on Wednesday for some of its disputes
to be decided by a Swiss-based arbitration panel to keep them out
of the jurisdiction of the civil courts.
</P>
<P>
In a major departure from the past, delegates from UEFA's
51-member countries agreed at their eighth Extraordinary Congress
here that non-sporting disputes should be settled by the Court of
Arbitration for Sport (CAS), based in Lausanne.
</P>
<P>
Executive Committee member Dr Joseph Mifsud of Malta said the
arbitration panel would not deal with sporting disputes but with
issues such as doping, club suspensions or fines and other matters
of a pecuniary nature.
</P>
<P>
"If it is a dispute of a sporting nature like whether a red
card or player's suspension is valid or not, then we shall deal
with it through our own disciplinary procedures as before," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"But where there is a dispute of a pecuniary matter, or of a
doping case which cannot be resolved by UEFA, then the appellant
can take the case to CAS who will take the final decision, " he
added.

TOKYO, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Tokyo prosecutors today
arrested Atsuo Miki, former president of Yamaichi Securities Co.,
in connection with the brokerage's alleged payoffs of some 79
million yen (660,000 U.S. dollars) to a corporate racketeer.
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office suspects that Miki
approved illegal compensations to the suspected racketeer Ryuichi
Koike for securities trading losses, in violation of the
Commercials Code and the Securities and Exchange Law.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors today searched Miki's home and his Yamaichi
Securities head office.
</P>
<P>
Five former and current executives of the brokerage house were
already arrested in connection with the case on September 17.
</P>
<P>
Miki, who resigned as president of Yamaichi in August over the
scandal, is suspected of planning the illegal compensations
together with other executives.
</P>
<P>
Koike, who is in custody and has been indicted in similar
payoff scandals involving Nomura Securities Co., and Dai-Ichi
Kangyo Bank, was served a fresh arrest warrant September 17 in
connection with the case.
</P>
<P>
According to investigation sources, Koike opened an account at
Yamaichi in June 1994 through a real estate company owned by his
younger brother and asked the brokerage to undertake illegal
discretionary trading on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
He demanded compensation from Yamaichi in December the same
year after the discretionary trading resulted in losses totaling
some 30 million yen (250,000 U.S. dollars)
</P>
<P>
Yamaichi reimbursed Koike for the losses with the use of
profits garnered through investments on futures trading on the
Singapore International Money Exchange.
</P>
<P>
Payoff to Sokaiya are banned under Japan's Commercial Code,
while both the reimbursement of stock transaction losses and
discretionary securities trading are prohibited under the
Securities and Exchange Law.

<HEADLINE> FM Spokesman on Guidelines for Japan-US Defense Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Defense cooperation between
Japan and the United States, a bilateral arrangement formed under
certain historical circumstances, should be strictly limited
within the bilateral scope in order to prevent arousing unrest
amongst Asian nations and bringing unnecessarily complicated
factors to the regional security situation.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang made the
remarks today in response to a question raised by Xinhua
concerning the recently introduced guidelines for Japan-US defense
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the practice of strengthening military
alliance and expanding military cooperation run counter to the
trends in the situation in the Asia-Pacific Region which is
witnessing relative political stability, sustained economic growth
and active security dialogue," said Shen.
</P>
<P>
"We have consistently urged Japan and the United States to
proceed cautiously concerning the defense cooperation issue,
including reviewing guidelines, practicing restraint rather than
expanding the scope of cooperation under their alliance, and
refraining from actions which might in any way arouse concern
amongst neighboring countries."
</P>
<P>
Shen also pointed out that due to historical reasons,
orientation of Japan's defense policy has always been a very
sensitive issue to neighboring Asian nations. Shen expressed the
hope that Japan draws lessons from history and firmly follow the
path of peaceful development.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that an important reason China is concerned about
the guidelines for Japan-US defense cooperation rests with its
relationship to the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
As everyone knows, Taiwan is an inseparable part of China. "The
Chinese government and people will never accept violations of or
interference in China's sovereignty by either directly or
indirectly including the Taiwan straits in the scope of Japan-US
defense cooperation, Shen said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that both Japan and the US will honor their
commitments to China concerning the Taiwan issue, respect the
solemn stance of the Chinese side in this regard, and refrain from
doing anything which will in any way harm China's interests or
hurt the feelings of the Chinese people."

<HEADLINE> French Fashion Designer Sees Expanding Chinese Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Fashion designer Daniel
Tribouillard, who is here as a guest of the Shanghai International
Fashion and Culture Festival, said here today that he would like
to present the charm of Chinese culture to the rest of the world
through his work.
</P>
<P>
He added that he is confident about his business in China.
</P>
<P>
This is Tribouillard's fifth visit to China's largest
commercial center.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the oriental sentiments that permeate his work
have contributed to the designer's success. Evidence of the
architecture of Beijing's Forbidden City, the designs of blue
porcelain, the frog buttons of traditional Chinese gowns, and
flowers like the chrysanthemum, plum blossom, and cymbidium can be
found in his designs. He has even used Chinese folk songs as
background music for some of his fashion shows.
</P>
<P>
"There is so much to be learned from Chinese culture. It has
fascinated me and every now and then gives me inspirations,"
Tribouillard commented.
</P>
<P>
He has brought about 100 items that caused quite a stir in
Paris last April with him to this festival, whose theme is "Best
Wishes to China" His work reflects oriental refinement and
elegance while retaining modern elements and advanced design
techniques.
</P>
<P>
The audience are touched, he said, because they see their own
tradition and culture in it.
</P>
<P>
He opened his first shop in Shanghai two years ago and now has
high hopes for the Chinese market, and says that his company,
Lenonard, will focus on Asia, as the demand for fashion increases
with the standard of living.
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to let Asian people, especially the Chinese people,
know that Leonard's designers can make them look more beautiful,"
he explained.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Backed Agriculture Project in Heilongjiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, September 24 (Xinhua) -- A new agriculture development
project, backed by the World Bank, began to be undertaken today in
Heilongjiang Province in northeast China.
</P>
<P>
The 240-million-US-dollar project is one of the largest in the
country, according to Yu Fei, director of the Provincial
Agricultural Development World Bank Loan office. Half of the funds
will come from the World Bank, and the rest from local governments.
</P>
<P>
It has some 80 sub-projects in animal husbandry, aquatic
products breeding, and farm products processing, in 31 counties
and cities, and is expected to be completed in five years.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Agriculture says that 7.74 billion dollars of
the 28 billion dollars in loans the World Bank has extended to
China are in agriculture development. The bank has backed 184
projects in the country.
</P>
<P>
After a careful study of the province, John Stemp, World Bank
project manager, said that the province is rich in agricultural
resources, with its vast stretches of grassland and inland waters.
</P>
<P>
"The project is aimed at improving the overall economic
efficiency of agricultural development by increasing the output of
animal husbandry and aquatic products industry and importing new
technology and equipment to process farm products," Stemp noted.
</P>
<P>
Sun Kuiwen, vice-governor of the province, said the province
produces 30 billion kilograms of grain annually, more than 60
percent of which is sold directly at market, and the project will
bring in more profits by introducing advanced food processing
equipment and technology.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that the project can bring total output of 25
billion yuan and 5.4 billion yuan in profits over the next
decade.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Calls for Respect for Court's Ruling on PIRMA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- President Fidel Ramos today
called on the Filipinos to respect the Supreme Court decision on a
people's initiative to amend the country's constitution.
</P>
<P>
In a statement he read at his weekly press conference in the
Presidential Palace, Ramos said he viewed the court's decision as
a "clear verdict that citizens can not avail of the people's
initiative as a means to effect changes in our constitution at
this time because of the inadequacy of the law."
</P>
<P>
"I called on everyone to respect the High Court's decision just
as I welcome the announcement of the pro-people's initiative
group, the People's Initiative for Reform, Modernization and
Action (PIRMA), to abide and be guided by it," Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court junked the third petition filed by the PIRMA
to change the charter in a vote of 13:0 on Tuesday, effectively
ending a campaign by Ramos' supporters to have him run for a
second term.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said the ruling should lay to rest "any remaining
unfounded speculations about my own position" on the matter of
charter changes as categorically enunciated in his recent
statements.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the president has made it clear that he would not seek
a second term and that changes to the charter can only be made
after the May 1998 elections by the way of a constitutional
convention.
</P>
<P>
In the past few months, charter change moves seeking to extend
the term of President Ramos has caused political uncertainties in
the country, prompting half a million people to attend a protest
rally held in Manila on September 21.
</P>
<P>
The country's constitution allows Ramos to serve only a single
term of six years. As required by the charter, Ramos should step
down when his term ends in June next year.

LONDON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Women who are aggressive may
be suffering from elevated testosterone levels, a recent American
study on female prisoners has found, the Daily Telegraph reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The results of the study, carried out by scientists from
the Georgia State University on 90 female prisoners, show that those
whose crimes involved violence have higher testosterone levels
than the others,
</P>
<P>
High testosterone level is also present in women who are
aggressively domineering.
</P>
<P>
The study finds that the aggression dwindled with age as the
testosterone levels fall. But older inmates, who still have high
levels of the hormone, are just as aggressive or dominant as when
younger.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 24 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim
Young-sam formally resigned as head of the ruling New Korea Party
(NKP) today, paving the way for party presidential candidate Lee
Hoi-chang to take the helm of the troubled party.
</P>
<P>
Kim submitted his resignation to the NKP head office via his
senior secretary for political affairs Cho Hong-rae this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Lee is expected to become party leader in a national convention
to be held September 30, with Kim as an honorary president of the
party.
</P>
<P>
Cho said Kim asked his party members to be united in their
support for Lee.
</P>
<P>
The practice of handing over party presidency is aimed at
bolstering the political power of the presidential candidate
before the December presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Lee's candidacy is facing a grave crisis due to his low public
support and intraparty conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Some critics within the NKP openly demand the replacement of
Lee's candidacy and members of a NKP faction loyal to Kim are
threatening that they may "take group action" unless Lee's
popularity rebounds soon.
</P>
<P>
Lee is now in the third place trailing opposition leader Kim
Dae-jung and Rhee In-je, former Kyonggi governor, in the
presidential campaign.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Israeli's urban
wage-earning families' average net monthly income in 1996 remained
virtually the same as in the previous year, Israeli Central Bureau
of Statistics (CBS) announced today.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the monthly income averaged 7,200 shekels (about 2,050
U.S. dollars), which in reality was equal to that of 1995 by
taking inflation into consideration.
</P>
<P>
With inflation rate at 10 percent in 1996, the averaged net
monthly income of 6,527 shekel (about 1,865 dollars) in 1995 had
no real increase in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The CBS said the data was based on a survey of 4,581
wage-earning households. Further details of the study are to be
released in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
Gross monthly income of these families last year averaged 9,250
shekels (about 2,643 dollars), before deductions for income tax,
National Insurance Institute payments and health tax.
</P>
<P>
This figure was 0.1 percent lower in real term than the 1995's
8,417 shekels (about 2,405 dollars) considering inflation rate,
the CBS said.

for East Asian countries to make a success of their reforms which
the bank has long advocated.
</P>
<P>
Wrapping up discussions on East Asia at a series of seminars
over the past week at a press briefing here, Severino said that
another issue on top of the agenda of the seminars is the
situation in Southeast Asia, on which much of the discussions was
focused.
</P>
<P>
He said the World Bank will actively participate in the efforts
of Southeast Asian countries and strengthen its supply to its
clients there.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank will also strengthen its activity in Southeast
Asia to probe the causes of the financial crisis which has swept
the region in the past months, he said.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Well Curbed in Brazil: Finance Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The expected rate of
inflation for the year 1997 is between five and six percent, the
lowest Brazil has seen since the early 1950's, Brazilian Finance
Minister Pedro Malan said here today.
</P>
<P>
This year will be the fourth consecutive year of declining
inflation since 1993, a most important achievement of Brazilian
society in recent years, he told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the country's inflation stood at nine to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Curbed inflation has laid foundation for achieving the other
two macro-economic objectives of the Brazilian government --
sustained growth and more social justice, said Malan, who is here
attending the annual meetings of the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
The year 1997 will also be the fifth consecutive year of
sustained growth of per capita GDP of Brazil, he said. The average
growth rate in the past five years is over four percent in real
terms.
</P>
<P>
But Brazil's economy would grow faster as favorable conditions
are created through privatization, productivity increases and
investment in education, he said.
</P>
<P>
Millions of Brazilians had been lifted out of poverty, but much
more remains to be done in the area which requires a medium- and
long-term view, he said.
</P>
<P>
There are two major challenges facing Brazilian macroeconomic
policy -- the current account deficit and public sector deficit,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's current account deficit rose from 2.5 percent of GDP
in 1995 to 3.3 percent last year, and to 4.3 percent in the 12
months ending on August 31, he said.
</P>
<P>
But about half of the current account deficit has been financed
by foreign direct investment in 1997, he noted. Brazil will
continue to tap the international capital market by issuing
longer-maturity instruments, he said.
</P>
<P>
In order to further bring down the public sector deficit, which
has dropped to five percent of GDP, he said, fiscal reforms and a
tight budget will be adopted.
</P>
<P>
The Federal government has entered into legally binding
agreements with 20 of the 27 states on their fiscal adjustment and
privatization programs for the next few years, he said.

<HEADLINE> Aboriginal Health National Shame for Australia: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The health status of
Australia's indigenous people is a national shame, a leading
medical adviser told the World Health Organization's Western
Pacific Committee meeting in Sydney today.
</P>
<P>
Aboriginal infant mortality rate is about three times higher
than that of non-indigenous Australian infants and life expectancy
of Australia's 300,000 Aboriginal men and women are 15 to 20 years
below that of non-indigenous Australians, Dr. Ian Anderson told
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Anderson, a medical adviser to a governmental agency in charge
of Aboriginal health services, told delegates from more than 30
countries that blindness occurs up to 10 times more frequently in
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people than among other
Australians.
</P>
<P>
A 1994 study showed one-third of indigenous Australians
suffered from a long-term health condition, Anderson was quoted
today by the Australian Associated Press as saying.
</P>
<P>
Anderson noted that the effects of substance abuse,
particularly alcohol and tobacco, malnutrition and poor child
health are typical conditions facing indigenous Australians, who
live 20 years less on average than non-indigenous people.
</P>
<P>
"High unemployment, a lack of adequate housing and community
structure particularly in remote rural areas of Australia,
compound the disadvantages of indigenous people that contribute to
... (their lower) health status."
</P>
<P>
"Quite bluntly the lower status of indigenous people,
especially if you compare it to the wider Australian community, is
a matter of national shame," Anderson said.

<HEADLINE> Ma Man Kei on 15th CPC National Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Ma Man Kei, vice-chairman of
the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC), recently noted that the 15th
National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) drafted
strategic plans for China's development well into the next century.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin's report contained an explicit explanation of the
Macao question and greatly increased the confidence of the
majority of Macao compatriots on their future, said Ma, who also
serves as president of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce of
Macao.
</P>
<P>
Ma, 77, who attended the 15th CPC National Congress as a
special nonvoting delegate, said it was an honor for him and he is
excited about having been present at such a significant meeting.
</P>
<P>
China's comprehensive national strength has increased rapidly
over the past decade and the living standards of the people have
improved significantly under the direction of Deng Xiaoping
Theory, said Ma.
</P>
<P>
The 15th Party Congress defined Deng Xiaoping Theory as a great
banner, said Ma, adding that the move complies totally with the
requirements of the times and the will of the people.
</P>
<P>
Ma also noted that the 15th Party Congress has made
arrangements for political reform, building a democratic legal
system and cultural progress. He said that strengthening the rule
of the country according to law and ensuring ethical and cultural
progress represented a major achievement of the congress.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's report emphasized that the Party will never allow
corrupt people to hide in the party. Jiang also noted that
anti-corruption represents a decisive political struggle related
to the life and death of the Party and the country.
</P>
<P>
Ma, a resident of Macao since the 1940s, said the 15th CPC
National Congress has greatly bolstered Macao's social stability,
economic development and the forthcoming smooth transition.
</P>
<P>
He said the "one country, two systems" principle advanced by
Deng Xiaoping has been implemented smoothly in Hong Kong, a fact
which shows that the Communist Party of China and the Central
Government will keep their promises.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin noted that Macao's return to the embrace of the
motherland in 1999 will be yet another significant event for the
Chinese nation, said the confident Ma, adding that Jiang's report
portends "bright prospects for Macao".

BEIJING, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Luo Gan, a state councillor
and secretary-general of the State Council, meeting with Sok An,
the Cambodian minister in charge of the Cabinet, today, said that
the Sino-Cambodian friendship was established through the joint
efforts of Chinese leaders of the old generation and King Norodom
Sihanouk, and that it has withstood the test of time and
international changes.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government attaches great importance to its
relations with Cambodia, he said, and expressed the conviction
that Sok An's visit will further promote bilateral ties,
especially economic and trade relations.
</P>
<P>
Sok An congratulated China on the successful conclusion of the
15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, and said
that the purpose of his visit is to increase bilateral
co-cooperation in economic, trade and other areas.
</P>
<P>
Sok An and his party are here as guests of Wu Yi, the minister

<HEADLINE> Some 190 Iranians Drowned in Caspian Sea in Summer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Parviz Fallah, head of the Public Relations Department of the
Mazanderan Provincial Law Enforcement Forces, was quoted by the
agency as saying that a few of them were drowned in the rivers in
the province.
</P>
<P>
The official said that most of the victims were visitors who
were not familiar with swimming or had ventured to swim in
prohibited areas.
</P>
<P>
He said statistics show that the youngest drowned was
two-year-old and the oldest 57.
</P>
<P>
Last year, a total of 252 people were drowned in the Caspian
Sea and the rivers in Mazanderan province. The death toll stood
at 287 in the previous Summer.
</P>
<P>
Some local people attributed the high death toll to the
separation of women and men in the swimming areas due to the
Islamic code.
</P>
<P>
Every year in summer hundreds of thousands of tourists,
particularly from the capital of Tehran, go to the Caspian
Sea coastal areas for a relief in the summer resorts.
</P>
<P>
However, the Islamic law prohibits men and women from
swimming together not only in the swimming pools but also in
the sea no matter they are married or unmarried, old or
young.
</P>
<P>
Armed policemen even patrol along the beach. Those who
swim together regardless of sex should be put into jail and
be punished. Thus, a couple and a family have to swim in
different and distant zones without protection by their friends
and other experienced swimmers.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the female can not swim with the swimsuit, they
have to go into the sea with long clothes covering the whole
body. This is also one of the causes for high death toll of the
sea-going tourists.

<HEADLINE> State Owned Enterprises Privatized in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The Privatization Board (PB) of
Bangladesh has so far completed the process of privatizing 32
State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) since the present government came
to power in June 23 last year, it was learned here today.
</P>
<P>
Of the 32, PB Chairman Kazi Zafarullah said, three industries
had already been handed over to new owners, letter of intent for
six had been issued and 20 would be put on sale immediately.
</P>
<P>
He added that three out of the 32 SOEs could not be handed over
on the order of the court despite payment by new owners.
</P>
<P>
The PB had identified 54 SOEs to divest in the current fiscal
year (starting from July 1, 1997), he stated.
</P>
<P>
The PB chairman urged donors' representatives to come forward
with financial assistance so that the government could pay the
proper dues of the workers, arrange retraining program for wishful
workers and bear the long-term liabilities of the privatizing
companies.
</P>
<P>
The chairman said that the PB off-loaded government shares in
nine companies since he assumed the office five years ago.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that five SOEs would be put under the management
of the workers and employees of the respective industries on trial
basis at the instruction of the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The PB was now holding talks with the labor leaders and
identifying five factories, he said, adding that the government
was very much conscious about the protection of interest of
workers of privatizing SOEs.

<HEADLINE> India's Export Affected by Volatile Currency Exchange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Variations in currency
exchange rates affected India's export growth in 1996-97, the
Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said today.
</P>
<P>
Shifts in the pattern of consumer preference and spending in
major export destinations like the United States, Japan and
countries of the European Union also inflicted a major blow to
Indian exports during 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
Demand for major items of export basket such as clothing,
footwear and leather accessories slackened in these developed
nations and contributed largely to the decline in the overall
exports from India, the RBI said in its annual report for 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
Adding to the problems were the imposition of anti-dumping
duties on imports of textiles by the European Union and the
maintenance of import licensing requirements for a variety of food
and agricultural products in countries like Canada, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Issues relating to environment and child-labor raised during
the year under review also adversely affected the export of items
such as leather products and carpets, the report further said.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin's Speech at Russian Federation Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Russia has already crossed the
"main line," with a free economy taking its root and a reversion
to the past impossible, said Russian President Boris Yeltsin here
today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Russian Federation Council, Yeltsin said
Russia's industrial downturn has stopped and production increase
has continued this year, reported the Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
Russia's recent accession to the Paris Club, he noted, "will
help expedite the payment of foreign debts, which run at 140,000
million US dollars."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin added that a reform in the housing-and-utilities system
and other social welfare sector is under way. The State will play
a greater role in the matter but not reverse to the Soviet-style
planning by establishing common rules for businessmen and not
interfering in their legitimate activities.
</P>
<P>
Debts concerning pensions and money allowances to the
servicemen and law enforcement personnel have been repaid, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Yeltsin acknowledged that there are problems still to
be resolved not only in the economy, but also in law-making
practices.
</P>
<P>
He proposed to lift the numerous taxes on agricultural
producers except on land, and to sell more land to private
citizens.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary to speed up the anti-corruption drive and to
block the "insolent creeping" of crimes into politics, Yeltsin
warned.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Turnaround in Thai Baht Expected Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 24 (Xinhua) -- International bankers here
are generally of the view that the Thai currency Baht is likely to
continue its downward trend in the coming months before picking up
gradually next year.
</P>
<P>
The Baht dipped to its new lows against the U.S. dollar this
week, reflecting that it takes time to restore market confidence,
according to participants at the ongoing annual meetings of the
World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) here.
</P>
<P>
Although the international community and the Thai government
have reacted to rescue the currency, months of assaults on it have
led to damages to market confidence, bankers said.
</P>
<P>
While excessive speculative trading has been blamed for the
weakening of the Baht, cumulative problems in the Thai economy and
banking sector have stood behind the turmoil, Michael Mussa, IMF
Research Director, said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's economic situation has been deteriorating in recent
years and become increasingly vulnerable since 1993, Mussa said.
</P>
<P>
Figures show that the current account deficit peaked at eight
percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) last year as a result of a
sharp slowdown in exports. The situation was also accompanied by a
high external debt equaling to 50 percent of GDP, of which about
40 percent was short-term.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, capital inflows have concentrated on property
development instead of a reasonable distribution in industrial
structure, making economic bubbles swelling.
</P>
<P>
As banks lent heavily to real estate industry, non-performing
loans expanded and banking risks grew, giving rise to inability
of the banking sector to deal with possible crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Thai Baht crisis, which also dragged down currencies of
other Southeast Asian countries, has aroused serious attention of
the international community. A rescue package of 16 billion U.S.
dollar emergency funds has been in place to help Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government has designed a medium-term policy framework
to restore market confidence and economic stability, consisting of
a wide range of measures including structural readjustment, export
promotion, public expenditure cut, tax increase and reform of the
banking sector.
</P>
<P>
Under the framework, the current account deficit is expected to
fall to five percent of the GDP this year and three percent of
the GDP next year, while economic growth will keep at 2.5 percent
this year and 3.5 percent next year.

The Thai government has strongly committed itself to the
adjustment program, with endorsement and support from the
international community, and implementation of the program is now
under way, Joseph Stiglitz, chief economist of the World Bank,
said.
</P>
<P>
"There should be confidence that the Thai economy will
eventually return to a sound track," he said.
</P>
<P>
But international bankers also noted that the devaluation of
Baht is a market correction to its previous over-valued status
and the market will not move to chase it until recognizing an
improvement in Thai economic situation.
</P>
<P>
"What's important for the market now is when the efforts will
produce substantial results," said Quentin Hills, Citibank's
regional head for Asian capital market business. "If positive
signs can be spotted by the year's end, a turnaround in market
confidence will most probably occur sometime next year."

<HEADLINE> Fresh Community Clash Kills 10 in S. Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- At least 10 persons have been
feared dead in a new wave of bloody clash between two rival
communities in south Nigeria's Osun state since Monday, the New
Nigerian reported today.
</P>
<P>
The renewed clash between the people of Ile-Ife and Modakeke
communities, which started early Monday, also resulted in the
burning down of about eight houses with an unidentified number of
people injured, the official newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The two communities went into hostilities last month over the
relocation of the local government headquarters from Modakeke to
Oke-Ogbo in Ile-Ife.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of people were killed while more than 100 others were
injured, with houses, vehicles and other properties set on fire.
Anti-riot police has since been deployed and the situation began
to calm down.
</P>
<P>
But the fragile peace in the area for the past weeks was
broken after the anti-riot police was sent to a neighboring area
to quell another riot triggered off by the reinstatement of a
local government chairman formerly removed by the election
tribunal.
</P>
<P>
The people of Ile-Ife and Modakeke communities reportedly
launched attacks on each other on Monday morning following the
re-deployment of the police, and the clash later turned into a
free for all fight.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, the August clash could better be
described as a child play to the present fracas as youths from
both sides were more militant in their approach this time around.
They often engaged themselves in face to face battle using both
modern weapons and "juju".
</P>
<P>
The state police commissioner has moved into the "war zone"
with his men to restore peace to the area, while armed soldiers
have also been sent there.
</P>
<P>
However, the situation in the area still remained unchanged as
youths from the two communities have vowed not to give up the
fight, the report said.

ATHENS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Greek professional football
players threatened Wednesday to have a strike to protest at an
increasing influx of foreign players.
</P>
<P>
The players' union made the threat in a statement following a
move by the Greek football federation to allow clubs to field six
non EU-players rather than four as previously.
</P>
<P>
Howls of protest immediately followed with players threatening
to stop playing for ten minutes during Sunday's matches prior to a
general strike on October 5.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Poverty Alleviation Project
(PAP) in the first 22 districts in Uganda received reciprocate
more than 1.1 billion Uganda Shillings (some 1.1 million U.S.
Dollars), ''the New Vision'' reported today.
</P>
<P>
The sum of the African Development Bank (ADB) funded program
represents 74 percent recovery rate, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Wilson Wamatsembe, the national project analyst, told the
paper that most beneficiaries have used their loans fruitfully
and now they are paying back.
</P>
<P>
But still, there are some districts where the PAP project
performance is undesired due to the security reason. He gave
Bundibugyo district in the west as an example where the recovery
rate is only 57 percent.
</P>
<P>
Richard Wanderema, the Bundibugyo project officer, explained
that some local population left their homes since the Allied
Democratic Forces rebels invaded into the district.
</P>
<P>
The soft loans provided by PAP project have been utilized by
local people in small scale business such as farming, bakery and
music/video production activities.
</P>
<P>
PAP project was started three years ago in 22 districts and
now it is set to cover whole the country.

<HEADLINE> British Defense Minister Ends Visit to Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 24 (Xinhua) -- British Defense Minister
George Robertson ended his three-day official visit here today
after concluding a Sea Skua missile deal with the Kuwaitis.
</P>
<P>
Robertson announced the sale to Kuwait of British Sea Skua
anti-ship missile systems on Tuesday, saying the contract was
signed between the British Defense Ministry and the Kuwaiti
government.
</P>
<P>
He did not disclose the value of the contract, but independent
sources said the contract is worth about 150 million U.S. dollars
in two stages.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Britain will supply the missiles worth 72
million dollars and the Skua launchers and installation worth
about 78 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Robertson also held lengthy discussions with Kuwaiti
officials on several potential defense deals for British
contractors, diplomatic sources said.
</P>
<P>
Among the outstanding contracts are a contract to provide AS90
self-propelled artillery mobile guns and a contract to upgrade
some 12 Hawk jets Kuwait bought in 1986.
</P>
<P>
Robertson tried to convince the Kuwaiti leaders of the quality
of the mobile guns which he said were deployed in Bosnia and
described "deterrent and effective."
</P>
<P>
The British minister arrived in Kuwait Monday for the first
visit to the region by a British Cabinet minister since the Labor
Party won power in last May.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Kuwait, Robertson also held talks with
Kuwaiti Amir Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, his Kuwaiti
counterpart Sheikh Salem Sabah Al-Salem Al-Sabah and other senior
Kuwaiti officials on ways to boost bilateral military cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have reiterated their determination to
strengthen defense cooperation in all fields. They signed a
defense cooperation agreement in 1992 following the 1991 Gulf
War.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Alerts of Ukrainian Ships in S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Defense Headquarters
confirmed today that two Ukrainian ships have been seen on the
territorial waters of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
But a defense spokesman said the mission of the ships,
reportedly to be in the troubled country since last week, is
unknown so far.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone is now under the economic embargo endorsed by its
west African neighbors who want the military junta to return
power to the legitimate government it overthrew in the May 25
coup.
</P>
<P>
The west African peace-keeping force known as ECOMOG is there
to enforce the embargo. ECOMOG has warned that it will attack any
vessels and aircraft trying to enter Sierra Leone without the
force's approval.
</P>
<P>
Lt. Col. Sam Tella, the defense spokesman, told Xinhua this
morning that investigations are underway to find out the
objective of the Ukrainian ships.
</P>
<P>
However, he ensured that "as soon as the result of the probe
is out, we will definitely let the public know".
</P>
<P>
As for the reported presence of a British warship in Sierra
Leone, the spokesman said he has no fears because Britain has
been supportive on the issue of reinstating democracy in Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman reiterated that ECOMOG troops, mainly Nigerian
soldiers, are not fighting Sierra Leone but only out to enforce
the economic sanctions imposed by west African leaders to force
the junta out.
</P>
<P>
He rejected reports of ECOMOG bombardment of power plants and
hospitals, saying that they are lies "being perpetrated by the
junta as part of its propaganda against the Nigerian government
and ECOMOG".

<HEADLINE> SE Asian Nations Urge IMF to Help Prevent Future Crises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Southeast Asian countries
today urged the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to take measures
 in preventing future currency crises.
</P>
<P>
"The Fund could devise a framework to enable countries to adapt
and cope more effectively with market excesses associated with
destabilizing capital flows," said Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's
Deputy Prime Minister.
</P>
<P>
"International rules" should apply not only to IMF members, but
also to "capital market participants", including rules and
principles on "ethical and professional standards," Anwar, who is
also Malaysian Minister of Finance, said at the annual meetings
of the World Bank and the IMF at the Hong Kong Convention and
Exhibition Center.
</P>
<P>
"The contagion effect of the financial crisis which began in
Thailand but spilled over to its neighbors, have reached an
intensity beyond our expectations," Anwar said.
</P>
<P>
Southeast Asian economies have been affected by a currency
crisis sparked by Thailand's devaluation of the Baht on July 2 due
to a huge current account deficit and the disclosure of massive
bad debts in the banking sector.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said that the recent depreciation of the region's
currencies illustrated that sound policies are no guarantee
against speculative activities and highlighted the problems faced
by countries with less sophisticated financial systems.
</P>
<P>
But it had provided the impetus to form a forum to discuss
regional issues as well as explore remedial policy action.
</P>
<P>
This forum now provides a basis for the establishment of a
facility to enhance the IMF's efforts towards economic and
financial stability to support macroeconomic adjustments, Anwar
said.
</P>
<P>
The IMF must be prepared to view the predicament of emerging
economies and the effort to deal with the effect on their markets
caused by speculators, he added.
</P>
<P>
Also at the annual meetings, the Philippines urged the IMF to
take a "more aggressive role" in helping member countries regulate
the financial sector to prevent future currency crises.
</P>
<P>
Finance Secretary Roberto de Ocampo said "volatile capital
inflows will continue to be a challenge" in the years to come,
stressing the answers are not in a return to controls but in
managing these flows better.
</P>
<P>
There must be room for the multilateral institutions to play a
more aggressive role in preventing such crises, he told the WB/IMF
annual meetings.
</P>
<P>
The IMF needs to reinvigorate its surveillance functions and
improve its data dissemination, he said.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting today, Indonesia also expressed its concerns
with the excessive volatility of many currencies which undoubtedly
creates uncertainties in the business community, and in turn could
lead to an economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
"In this regard, I would urge the IMF to take an active role
according to its mandate," said Mar'ie Muhammad, Indonesia's
Finance Minister.
</P>
<P>
Since excessive volatility of currencies can hinder the world
economy, "we warmly welcome any regional or global initiatives to
stabilize currencies," he added.
</P>
<P>
Currency turmoil in Southeast Asia has enhanced Vietnam's
awareness of the need to speed up reform, State Bank of Vietnam's
Deputy Governor Le Duc Thuy said.
</P>
<P>
"Recent developments in the region help to enhance Vietnam's
awareness of the importance of accelerating the reform process,
thus improving efficiency in the use of resources, raising
domestic savings and investment rates, and reducing vulnerability
to external shock," he said.

<HEADLINE> Transparency Critical to Avoiding Financial Crisis: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 24 (Xinhua) -- What Mexico learned from
the financial crisis in 1995 is that there should be "much more
transparency in terms of information flow", Mexican Secretary of
Finance and Public Credit Grillermo Ortiz said here today.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the lessons generated from the crisis, he said,
Mexico is now publishing figures of current balance and reserves
regularly. In addition, conferences are held to brief investors
and analysts on the latest developments of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference here today that, from Mexico's
experience, when a crisis breaks out, the first thing to be done
is to diagnose the situation and try to assess the extent of the
damage.
</P>
<P>
At the outset of the crisis, he said, the government should
tell its people that the situation is a delicate one and that
strong measures are needed to redress this situation, because
"otherwise it will be very difficult to explain the harshness."
</P>
<P>
"In our experience, it's much better to confront directly the
problem," said the Mexican Official, who is here attending the
Annual Meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question on what Latin America can learn from
the Asian experience, he listed long-term high growth and strong
domestic savings, among others, which contribute to the strength
of Asian economies, as things to be learned.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the current financial crisis in Thailand, he said
that with the assistance of the World Bank and the IMF and other
economies in East Asia, "I think the Thai crisis will be easing
off soon."
</P>
<P>
Talking about the Mexican economy, he said, growth in 1997 is
projected to be 6 percent, or perhaps higher.
</P>
<P>
The recovery is based basically on investment, which increased
over 21 percent in the first six months of this year, pointing to
a consolidated growth through 1998, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mexico expects 15 to 16 billion U.S. dollars in capital inflows
for 1997, of which 75 percent is foreign direct investment, he
added.
</P>
<P>
And not only Mexico, but also the whole Latin American region,
will brace a consolidated process of sustained growth forward, he
said.

</P>
<P>
The Financial Times:
</P>
<P>

The Independent:
</P>
<P>
-- Senior industrialists will today tell Prime Minister
Tony Blair that business is being hurt by the strength of

Whitehall.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>

<P>
PARIS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Northern Ireland's Protestant Unionists and Sinn Fein
republicans sat face to face at the negotiating table Tuesday for
the first time since the partitioning of Ireland in 1921. But the
Ulster Unionist Party used the encounter to demand the expulsion of
Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA. But their chances of being
listened to by Prime Minister Tony Blair are zero, as the British
government intends to win a negotiated solution with Sinn Fein which
represents 41 percent of the votes of the Catholic community in
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- A study by the state statistics and economic institute INSEE
said that inheritance remains the most sure way to become rich in
France today, and the chances for a well-paid and hard-working
salary-owner to make a fortune are almost zero. There are 200
million households regarded as ``rich'' with about 10 million francs
(1.7 million US dollars) of heritage.
</P>
<P>
-- With its finger burnt by terrorist attacks in France launched
by Islamic extremists of Algeria, the French government maintains
the minimalist policy made by former Prime Minister Alain Juppe
toward Algeria, which limits its reaction toward violence in Algeria
to expressing regret.

<HEADLINE> American Doctors Suggest All Boys To Be Circumcised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- An American science team
suggest in a British journal published here today that
universal circumcision of all newborn boys should be brought
in as a public health measure.
</P>
<P>
The paper published by the British Medical Journal says
that it would prevent disease and save money. Not only would
circumcision give protection against HIV, but it would also
reduce cancer and limit infections.
</P>
<P>
Uncircumcised boys are ten times more likely to suffer
from urinary tract infections and potentially permanent
kidney damage, it says.
</P>
<P>
The author, Edgar Schoen of the Kaiser Foundation
Research Institute in Oakland, California, says
uncircumcised heterosexual men are four times as likely to
become infected with HIV, while only ten of the 50,000 cases
of penile cancer in the U.S. since 1930 have involved
circumcised men.
</P>
<P>
But in the same journal, Angus Nicholl of the British
Public Health Laboratory Service says there is a small but
persistent risk of complication from male circumcision and
the public health value of a routine circumcision policy has
not been proved. He calculates that circumcision for non-HIV
sexually transmitted diseases would not be cost-effective.

<HEADLINE> Algeria's Islamic Salvation Army Declares Ceasefire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The Islamic Salvation Army (AIS),
the armed wing of the outlawed Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) of Algeria,
today announced a ceasefire with the government from October 1,
according to a communique by the armed group.
</P>
<P>
In the communique, which was signed by AIS National Emir Madani
Mezerag on September 21 and faxed to Agence France-Presse (AFP)
Bonn bureau today, AIS called on other armed Islamic groups in
Algeria "attached to Islam and the nation" to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
But it finger-pointed the Armed Islamic Group (GIA), which is
believed to be the most radical and bloody armed group in Algeria,
as "a criminal group".
</P>
<P>
This communique was apparently prepared before the latest
massacre took place in Bentalha south of Algiers, in which around
200 civilians, most of them women and children, were killed from
Monday night to Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
AIS said that to "arrive at a just and legitimate solution,
the National Emir of the Islamic Salvation Army orders all the
chiefs of the combatting companies under its command to stop
combat operations from... October 1, 1997."
</P>
<P>
AIS "calls on all other groups attached to the interests of
the religion and the nation to respond to this appeal in order to
expose the enemy who hides behind the abominable massacres and to
isolate the criminals of the GIA (Armed Islamic Group) and those
who hide behind them," said the communique.
</P>
<P>
The communique was issued several weeks after Abassi Madani, the
former FIS chief who was released from jail three months ago, said
he would appeal for a ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
AIS said that "after contacts which have been going on for
a long time" with unspecified Algerian institutions, it decided
to "put the enemies of yesterday and today before their
responsibilities" to "encourage the sons of Algeria to take
initiative to act together for the return of security and
stability to let the country go out of the crisis."
</P>
<P>
It said that the release of Madani had "pushed the enemies of
yesterday and today to manipulate the pawns in the game to fan the
flame of fire of disorder and foil all susceptible project to
animate the country and motivate the citizens."
</P>
<P>
It described the massacres of civilians as "abominable carnages
rarely seen in the modern history of humanity" which remind one of
the "dreadful scenes lived by our people on the eve of
independence" from France in 1962.
</P>
<P>
It calls on Algerians to "unite their efforts" as the
"situation is dangerous and the conspiracy is great".

<HEADLINE> Zambia Ranks Fourth in HIV/AIDS in Africa: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Zambia is the fourth highest
country hardest hit with HIV/AIDS in Africa, with 25 percent of
the population being HIV/AIDS positive.
</P>
<P>
Opening the seventh national AIDS conference here Tuesday,
Vice-president Brigadier-general Miyanda said one in every four
adults in Zambia is infected with the disease, making the country
rank 4th in HIV/AIDS infection following Kenya, Uganda and South
Africa, according to "The Post" paper today.
</P>
<P>
"Zambia is at the butt of Africa's AIDS bed which stretches
from Kenya through Uganda down to South Africa," Miyanda was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He told the conference whose theme is collaboration in the
fight against HIV/AIDS that infection is prevalent between the
ages of 20-30 in females and 30-40 in males.
</P>
<P>
Miyanda disclosed the number of orphaned children as a result
of the HIV/AIDS pandemic has increased and is now between
300,000-500,000.
</P>
<P>
During 1995 alone, between 600,000 to 700,000 Zambians were
estimated to be HIV/AIDS positive and between 40,000 to 50,000
people were said to have died of the disease, according to an
earlier report by a state-owned newspaper Times of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Statistics based on computer projections for HIV/AIDS released
last week show that the rates of infection in Zambia will peak at
about 27 percent of the adult population by 1998 and the rates
will continue to rise rapidly toward the end of this decade and
possibly into the next.
</P>
<P>
In referring to some claims that safe sex methods have been
introduced in the Zambian market, Miyanda stressed that there is
need to stop casual sex instead of encouraging it because the
country is at the center of the AIDS belt.
</P>
<P>
"Don't go out to experiment with methods of prevention which
are not fool proof," Miyanda added.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president challenged the participants including
delegates from Zimbabwe and South Africa to come up with serious
conclusions that will help check the problem of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
He stated that the Zambian government is ready to work with
non-governmental organizations in the fight against AIDS and is
in the process of formulating an AIDS council whose secretariat
would be based at his office.
</P>
<P>
At the three-day meeting, Elizabeth Mataka, Zambia National
AIDS Network chairperson, blamed the rapid spread of AIDS on the
incidence of sexual abuse of children and called on the
government to stiffen the law against child abuse.
</P>
<P>
She said the child abuse is not only "traumatic" to the
victims but posed a real danger in the spread of HIV/AIDS.

<HEADLINE> Taylor No More Wanted in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Liberian President Charles
Taylor can now visit the U. S. without fear of being arrested,
following the dismissal by an American district magistrate's
court of the extradition charges filed against him 13 years ago.
</P>
<P>
A press report said today that Liberia earlier this month sent
a note to the U.S. authorities, saying that it had "withdrawn its
request for the extradition of Mr. Taylor".
</P>
<P>
Once a senior official with President Samuel Doe's government,
Taylor was charged with corruption and escaped to the U.S. in
1984.
</P>
<P>
He was arrested in Boston in May of the same year, but later
mysteriously broke the jail before he was extradited to Monrovia
as requested by the then Liberian government.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after he was elected the president last month, reports
quoted a U.S. court as saying that Taylor will be arrested if he
dares into U.S., because the extradition charge is still there.

</P>
<P>
Wu extended a warm welcome to Youla, who is on his first visit

Sino-Guinean relations.
</P>
<P>
Wu noted China's satisfaction with the smooth development of

</P>
<P>
He said China attaches great importance to Sino-Guinean

</P>
<P>
Wu went on to say that Youla's current visit here will
strengthen the development of bilateral friendship and cooperation.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Recidivism Rate Low in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The recidivism rate among
imprisoned criminals in China has been kept under eight percent
during the past 30 years -- the lowest of any country in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Ministry of Justice attribute this to the
modern and civilized methods used in Chinese prisons and
reform-through-labor institutes to educate inmates.
</P>
<P>
The ministry launched a project to build modern and civilized
prisons and reform institutes in January 1994. Five prisons and five
reform institutes have been cited as outstanding examples.
</P>
<P>
The project has proved effective in promoting the scientific
management system, improving the re-education methods in prisons
and reform institutes, and as a result reducing recidivism.

LONDON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Bright orange fireballs
in the sky panicked people across Scotland on Tuesday, The
Daily Telegraph reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The fireballs with explosions and "wooshing" sounds may
have been a broken-up satellite re-entering the atmosphere,
the British Defense Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Coastguards, police and the Royal Air Force (RAF)
received many calls from people who saw or heard a flaming
object crash, rattling windows from the north-east of
England to the Western Isles.
</P>
<P>
The British Geological Survey in Edinburgh said that its
seismometers, planted at 40-mile intervals across Britain,
had picked up an impact that broke the sound barrier.
</P>
<P>
RAF chiefs contacted NASA, the American space agency,
which said it was not aware of any incidents involving
satellite re-entry into the atmosphere that could have been
responsible. After hours of checking data, scientists in
Edinburgh said the cause was likely to be a meteor.
</P>
<P>
But the Defense Ministry said last night that the flashes were
most likely to be from "an old satellite which broke up in space
last week".

<HEADLINE> IMF Official on Capital Account Liberalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The process of the capital
account liberalization must be paced in accordance with the actual
circumstances of each country, a senior official of the
International Monetary Fund IMF) said here today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Chinese reporters covering the World
Bank/IMF annual meetings being held in Hong Kong, Manuel Guitian,
director of the Monetary and Exchange Affairs Department of the
IMF, said that the IMF believes that the liberalization of capital
flows is important because it can increase the efficiency in the
use of savings and the welfare of all member countries.
</P>
<P>
"However, we are also aware that a very open and very
liberalized system of capital movement can cause problems for
these countries," Guitain added.
</P>
<P>
The interest of the IMF in free capital movement is not
associated just in liberalization itself, but in its being
implemented and sustained, Guitian stressed.
</P>
<P>
So, it is not enough to achieve a liberalization of capital, he
said, adding that it has to be achieved in a way that it can be
sustained.
</P>
<P>
This is a very important subject because in today's very
integrated international economy, no country can afford to isolate
itself and exist.
</P>
<P>
The challenge is that there is no way to benefit from the
opportunities that the capital flows provide without being exposed
to the risks.
</P>
<P>
The process of China's capital account liberalization will have
to be paced to the speed with which the domestic reforms can be
undertaken, he added.

<HEADLINE> Fewer Farmers Pin Hopes of Prosperity on Having Sons (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Village officials in charge of
family planning in the Dabie Mountain area, one of the poorest
regions in central China, are now welcomed into the homes of the
farmers who for years turned away authorities urging them not to
have more children.
</P>
<P>
Until a few years ago, China's family planning workers spent
most of their time persuading poor farmers to abide by the
country's one-child policy, which many of the farmers believe
violates the old Chinese belief that sons are a sign of prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Now, family planners work to help poor farmers out of poverty
by offering incentives to stick to the one-child policy.
</P>
<P>
In Chinese cities, a couple is allowed to have only one child;
in rural areas, if a farmer's first child is a girl, the parents
may have a second child.
</P>
<P>
Poverty-stricken mountainous areas have the biggest problems
with family planning, according to officials. The birth rate in
these areas is higher than the country's average.
</P>
<P>
Dabie Mountain is located at an area where Anhui, Hubei and
Henan provinces meet.
</P>
<P>
Li Xianguo, a farmer with two daughters in Madian Village,
Jinzhai County of Anhui Province, said that three years ago
family planners in the village asked him not to have a third
child. Li said he became so fixated on the idea of having a son
that he was unable to do his job. His family lived in a straw hut,
and he earned less than 300 yuan (36 dollars) a year.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Bao, a county magistrate, learned of Li's situation during
an inspection tour of the village. Determined to help Li's family,
Zhao bought more than 100 kilograms of tea seeds and over 100
Chinese chestnut saplings for the poor farmer.
</P>
<P>
Li has so far planted 0.13 hectares of tea and 0.23 hectares of
Chinese chestnuts. He expects to earn 1,100 yuan (about 140
dollars) this year.
</P>
<P>
The 34-year-old father has already given up the idea of having
a son, and is applying to contract more uncultivated mountain land
to grow Chinese chestnuts and traditional Chinese medicine.
</P>
<P>
Li is among 10 million farmers in the Dabie Mountain area who
have changed their thinking about having big families.
</P>
<P>
Yu Yunxiu, deputy director of Jinzhai County's family planning
commission, said that convincing the farmers to follow the
one-child policy takes a lot of time and effort.

<P>
But the job has become simpler, as the primary task for family
planners now is to seek loans and arrange relief projects for
farmers, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Hong, a farmer with two girls, had a vasectomy at the
urging of local family planning workers. When he needed funds to
run a furniture factory, the village officials offered him 3,000
yuan (360 dollars).
</P>
<P>
His factory earned 200,000 yuan (26,800 dollars) in profits
last year, and Jiang said he would not have been able to borrow
the necessary funds if his did not become a model family-planning
household.
</P>
<P>
In a sign of support for family planning, all 23 workers at
Jiang's factory are from poor households that strictly observe the
family-planning regulations. The workers' annual income has
reached 6,000 yuan, three times higher than the country's average
in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Jinzhai County annually allocates more than five million yuan
in special funds to support poor farmers who observe the
family-planning policy. Each of the households which abide by the
policy can receive an average of 1,000 yuan (120 dollars) in
poverty relief and 400 yuan (48 dollars) in pension insurance.
</P>
<P>
So far, the county has built 82 old folks homes and bought
pension insurance for 12,000 parents who abide by the family
planning regulations.
</P>
<P>
Zhao, the magistrate, said that apart from offering funds for
aid-the-poor projects, the county government has also stipulated
that school children from one-child or two-daughter families can
remit their tuition or enjoy free education, and will be given
priority consideration for receiving Hope Project donations.
</P>
<P>
Zhao said the yearly income of families in his county who abide
by the state family planning policy will exceed 2,500 yuan (304
dollars) by 2000. The country's average income level in rural area
last year was 1,900 yuan.
</P>
<P>
In the past 20 years, the Dabie Mountain area has given six
million less births.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the State Family Planning Commission showed
that from 1979 to 1996, the birth rate in China had dropped nearly
50 percent, or giving about 300 million people less births.

<HEADLINE> Painters Should Drink Deep of Native Culture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Ding Shaoguang, a famous
Chinese painter living in the United States, has called on fellow
painters to take a deep drink of Chinese culture to gain higher
status in the international painting arena.
</P>
<P>
During a recent symposium held in this capital of north China's
Shanxi Province, Ding said his 18-year stay in the US renewed his
interest in the traditional culture of his motherland, and that
for most Chinese painters who live in the US or Europe, the
Chinese culture has become the heart of their artistic creation.
</P>
<P>
His achievement as a painter abroad is greatly due to the
influence of ancient Chinese painters, even the patterns on the
crudest ancient painted pottery and paper-cut works, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Only after fully understanding Western art and comparing it
with the Chinese culture have I realized the long-lasting appeal
of my mother culture," Ding remarked.
</P>
<P>
He told participants that more and more Western painters are
turning to oriental cultures, especially the traditional Chinese
culture, for new inspiration. The combination of ancient and
modern, abstract and concrete, Eastern and Western art forms is
becoming the dominant trend on the world painting arena, he
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Born in Yuncheng in Shanxi Province, Ding studied painting at
the Central Institute of Arts and Crafts in Beijing. On three
occasions, his works were selected by the United Nations as
designs for commemorative stamps.

<HEADLINE> Tourism Creates Thousands of Jobs in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of new tourism jobs
will be created as Zimbabwe Sun Company builds new hotels and
runs joint venture of safari camps with local businessmen, local
daily "The Herald" reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the company will build six new hotels

<HEADLINE> Artificial Rainfall Helps Relieve Drought in Northwest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Cloud-seeding and other
techniques for making artificial rain have helped to relieve
drought in this arid land of northwest China.
</P>
<P>
Since early this year, Gansu Province has sent 28 planes,
flying a total of more than 30,000 kilometers, to produce 700
million cubic meters of artificial rainfall through a process
known as cloud-seeding, in which chemicals are released into the
clouds to produce rain.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another technique which uses artillery shells to
melt hailstones in the sky, has been used more than 1,000 times,
to prevent crop damage from hail and increase the amount of rain.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Gansu was hit by a serious drought which covered a
large part of the province and lasted for months. The local
government sent 43 planes for cloud-seeding in the spring, summer
and autumn, and created 890 million cubic meters of rain.
</P>
<P>
In Yongchang County, where the drought had lingered for 75
days, the water supply in the country reservoir in 1995 was
increased by 12 million cubic meters through artificial
rainfall. The country's grain output rose by eight million kg in
the year.
</P>
<P>
Located in northwest China, Gansu is often plagued by drought
and hailstorms, said Xie Jinnan, director of the province's
meteorological bureau.
</P>
<P>
In the past six years, 51 of the province's 86 counties have
been benefited from the artificial rainfall, which guaranteed the
good harvests in these years.

<HEADLINE> French Press Condemns Massacre of Civilians in Algeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- French press today condemned
the massacre of more than 200 civilians in Bentalha south of
Algiers Monday night, and many papers carried on the front page
the picture of women grieving after their family members were
killed.
</P>
<P>
The daily Liberation said that the international community should
send neutral investigators to Algeria to see what is really going on
there, while the daily Ouest-France said that one ``becomes
criminal'' if he closes his eyes before the atrocities in Algeria.
</P>
<P>
The daily La Provence said that when violence in Algeria enters
this stage, one can no longer say they are killings but should call
them genocide.
</P>
<P>
The daily La Depeche du Midi criticized the international
community for maintaining ``a silence of death'' over Algeria.
</P>
<P>
The daily L'Yonne Republicaine said that the war in Algeria has
turned into a fratricide carried on by the military-industrial
ruling complex of Algeria which refuses to yield anything.
</P>
<P>
According to latest reports by Algerian newspaper El Watan, the
number of people killed in Bentalha was from 200 to 250, while the
Algerian daily Tribune quoted hospital sources as saying that 178
people were killed.
</P>
<P>
The Algerian government said 85 people were killed in the
massacre and ``categorically'' denied the figures reported by
foreign press, which put it at around 200.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 100,000 people have been killed in Algeria since
1992, when the country was plunged into violence.

<HEADLINE> IMF's Debt Relief Plan Beyond Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Kenya will not benefit from
a joint World Bank-International Monetary Fund (IMF) initiative
to help heavily-indebted developing countries because it is able
to service its foreign debts, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's external debt up to December 1996 was estimated to
total 6.2 billion U.S. Dollars, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
IMF resident representative in Nairobi Raimer Carstens was
quoted as saying that the initiative to assist heavily-indebted
poor states would be discussed during the IMF-World Bank annual
meeting in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"Kenya is not on the preliminary list of this initiative
because its external indebtedness is not that bad. The country is
still in a position to service its debts, which may increase the
confidence of investors and donors," said Carstens.
</P>
<P>
The initiative, endorsed by the two institutions last year, is
intended to reward countries which have a good record in economic
reforms by offering them easy debt relief.
</P>
<P>
He said that only Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire and Uganda has
been considered in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Bolivia is the only non-African country to benefit from the
initiative, Carstens added.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan President Moi complained last week that donors were
imposing extremely harsh conditions before giving aid to Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The IMF suspended a 205-million-Dollar aid package to Kenya in
July after accusing Nairobi of not doing enough to combat high
level corruption.
</P>
<P>
However, "the IMF hopes that this recent show of commitment by
the Kenyan government will pave the way for the second enhanced
structural adjustment facility to proceed without a hitch and
that Kenyan's economic growth will pick up after the elections,"
Carstens said.
</P>
<P>
"The IMF is only reiterating the conditions of restructuring
economy" of this east African country, he said.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Has Most Maternal Deaths in South Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Nepal accounts for the most
maternal deaths among the South Asian countries with 515 deaths
among every 100,000 women every year, the official RSS news agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
These women die from unprotected abortion and infection caused
hereby, the agency quoted the Family Planning Association of Nepal
(FPAN) as saying.
</P>
<P>
Poverty, illiteracy, lack of public awareness and social
pressure are the main reasons behind illegal abortion practices,
the FPAN said.
</P>
<P>
Almost 71 percent women in Nepal are ignorant that most
maternal deaths are caused by unsafe abortions, the FPAN said.
</P>
<P>
Nepal bans abortion and 75 percent of women behind bars were
jailed for undergoing illegal abortions, the association said.
</P>
<P>
The FPAN has introduced a fetus protection bill in the Upper
House as a non-governmental bill to deal with the problem.
</P>
<P>
The bill stresses the protection of the reproductive rights of
women and it is believed that the bill will help reduce the
maternal death, the RSS said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the FPAN has provided free family planning services
to couples in 33 districts and planned to extend the services to
all the 75 districts in the country, the agency added.

<HEADLINE> Wu Yi Stresses Trade Relations with Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Wu Yi, Chinese minister of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation today reaffirmed China's
emphasis on economic and trade cooperation with Cambodia and noted
the favorable conditions and great potential for further
development.
</P>
<P>
Wu pointed to the fact that China and Cambodia forged
diplomatic ties over 40 years ago and have since closely
coordinated economic and trade activities.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remarks during talks with Sok An, visiting
Cambodian minister in charge of the Cabinet of Ministers.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that China is satisfied with the quick recovery of
bilateral trade and economic relations, especially since the
proclamation of the government of the Kingdom of Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Statistics for the first half of this year show a bilateral
trade volume of 62.7 million US dollars, a dramatic 91 percent
rise on the corresponding period in 1996. Statistics also show a
record trade volume of 70.3 million US dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
China and Cambodia are currently facing similar tasks related
to economic development, and upgrading the living standards of
their people, said Wu, adding the Chinese government is ready to
push bilateral economic and trade ties up to a new plateau based
on the principle of equality and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
China hopes to expand personnel exchanges between business
sectors in the two nations, and encourages strong Chinese
enterprises to either invest or establish joint ventures in
Cambodia, said Wu.
</P>
<P>
Some 50 Chinese enterprises have established resident agencies
in Cambodia, while others have earmarked a total of 70 million US
dollars for investments in the country.
</P>
<P>
Sok An said it is a necessity for both countries to tighten
economic and trade relations to ensure mutual economic
development, protect the interests of their people, and to promote
the potential of the region as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Chinese enterprises are welcome to invest in Cambodia in
sectors such as petroleum, natural gas, and hydropower, as well as
export-oriented processing and industrial bases, said Sok. He also
pointed out that Cambodia has adopted preferential policies to
encourage related cooperation.

<HEADLINE> African Languages Face Crisis in Future: Lecturer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 24 (Xinhua) -- A Zimbabwean scientist has
warned that African languages face extinction unless governments
stop sidelining them in favor of foreign ones.
</P>
<P>
Lecturer of National University of Science and Technology Temba
Dlodlo predicted Tuesday that if nothing was done about the use of mother
tongues as official languages, then 100 years from today, the only
thing to remain African about the people of the continent would be
their blackness.
</P>
<P>
''Our language and cultures will be extinct, while our situation
will be like that of black Americans who now call themselves
Afro-Americans although their only link with the continent is the
color of their skin,'' Dlodlo said in a presentation to the
Scholarstica 97 Conference which started Tuesday in the country's
second largest city of Bulawayo.
</P>
<P>
He said while blackness might be considered a necessary
characteristic requirement for being African, it was not sufficient
as it had to come with the embracing of the languages and cultures of
the indigenous Africans that constitute the Africaness.
</P>
<P>
He said the use of mother tongue as language of instruction in
Africa would result in more pupils taking up science and technology
courses at colleges and universities, particularly those from rural
communities where the command of English language was inadequate.
</P>
<P>
''More African scientists would be produced which will result in
their making contributions in research, which will bring about the
spread of science and technology on the continent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
This would also create, Dlodlo said, a high degree of self-worth
and self-respect which were currently lacking because of the feeling
of inadequacy that most people have when they cannot communicate in
English in the right accent.

DAR ES SALAAM, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's retired
president Julius Nyerere has stressed that concerted efforts
should be taken by the government and Tanzanians in general to

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Kenya, Tanzania and
Uganda have been urged to enhance cooperation among them in
health sector, the local newspaper "Daily News" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Countries in the east African region should cooperate in the
prevention and control of communicable diseases, especially
the sexually transmitted ones, like AIDS, Deputy Executive
Secretary of the East African Cooperation (EAC), Fulgence Kazaura
said at an east African health sector conference in Arusha,
northern Tanzania, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He noted that communicable diseases impose the heaviest burden
on health systems in the three east African countries.
</P>
<P>
"The areas of cooperation designated under the health sector
will, therefore, broadly involve cooperation in the control and
prevention of diseases with emphasis on HIV/AIDS," said Kazaura.
</P>
<P>
He also cited other areas of cooperation, such as specialized
training, manpower development, production and procurement of
health learning materials, equipment, pharmaceutical and medical
services.
</P>
<P>
Kazaura stressed, "investment in health services is investment
in a more productive population."
</P>
<P>
It is the first meeting of the health sector under the
auspices of the EAC and is expected to identify health programs
that have regional character and discuss networking system for
strengthening existing health capacity services.

<HEADLINE> Guidelines Need Parliamentary Approval, Opposition Parties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Japanese opposition parties
today demanded that the government should gain parliamentary
approval for the just finalized review of the 1978 Guidelines for
Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The opposition New Frontier Party (NFP),the Democratic Party of
Japan (DPJ) and the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) said the new
guidelines need parliamentary approval.
</P>
<P>
Some of the proposed Japan-U.S. joint actions under the new
guidelines would go against the Japanese Constitution, the NFP
said.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the JCP Criticized the new guidelines as
creating a mechanism under which Japan will automatically be
involved in war when the United States starts military
intervention in the Asia-Pacific region under the pretext of
dealing with an emergency in areas surrounding Japan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Asahi Shimbun, a leading Japanese newspaper,
called for steps to prevent the new guidelines from becoming a
system that automatically drags Japan into U.S.-led wars.
</P>
<P>
"Real civilian control under politics based on sound security
views" will be required to prevent such a scenario, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The paper also said Japan's support for the U.S. military in
areas surrounding Japan as proposed in the new guidelines could
violate Japan's Constitution, which bans the exercise of the right
to collective self-defense and the use abroad of military force.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of (Japanese)politicians have not freed themselves from
the Cold War-era idea that Japan's security and interests can be
maintained only if Japan follows U.S. leadership in the
(bilateral military) alliance," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Japan and the United States adopted the new guidelines in New
York on Tuesday, drastically expanding the scope of Japan's
support for U.S. forces in the event of emergencies around Japan.
</P>
<P>
The new guidelines stipulate 40 items pertaining to
Japan-U.S. cooperation in the event of emergencies surrounding
Japan. Some of the items lack a clear legal basis in Japan,
defense experts said.

<HEADLINE> New Surgery for Unclogging Arteries Successful in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Doctors at the No. 1 Hospital
of the Harbin Medical University have cured a patient with clogged
arteries to the heart through a series of angioplasty operations.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time the new technique was used in China.
</P>
<P>
Jin Songlin, a worker from Wandashan Pharmaceutical Plant in
Mishan City, northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, experienced
numbness in his legs and had difficulty in walking about three months
ago.
</P>
<P>
When Jin was admitted to the hospital, renowned cardiologist
Dr. Meng Fanchao found that more than 90 percent of Jin's
abdominal aorta was blocked, and only a tiny stream of blood was
flowing to his lower limbs.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Meng decided to try angioplasty, in which a small balloon
is passed through the patient's arteries to dilate them. As the
operation progressed, Jin felt the warmth return to his legs and
his pain was diminished.
</P>
<P>
Several days later, he was up and walking and was soon
discharged.
</P>
<P>
Chinese doctors usually treat clogged arteries by artificial
bypass, which can easily cause coronary thrombosis. This
technique puts patients at high risk, due to the repeated opening
of the abdominal cavity to stop the thrombosis.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that the new technique may become more
popular in treating the artery ailment than the former.

<HEADLINE> Yunnan Effectively Protects Wetlands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Local sources report that
effective protection has been introduced to the Beihai Wetlands,
Tengchong County, the only natural reserve of its kind in
southwest China's Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
Wetlands, which are natural ecosystems with various species of
flora and fauna, are noted for their great capacity to purge
sewage and conserve water, according to experts. Wetlands are thus
ideal natural reserves and habitats for many rare species of wild
plants and waterfowl.
</P>
<P>
The Beihai Wetlands Reserve covers about 2,000 hectares and is
divided into two major sections -- Beihai Marshland and Qinghai
Lake, a freshwater lake used for irrigation.
</P>
<P>
The reserve is home to a wide variety of precious plants and
bird species, and is the winter home for well over 1,000 migratory
birds.
</P>
<P>
The Beihai Wetlands were placed under state protection in 1992,
and Tengchong County has established a special agency and issued
wide-ranging regulations to protect the area.
</P>
<P>
Planned afforestation has been carried out in the reserve and
surrounding areas in recent years, with strict regulations in
place to prohibit poaching. The local governments at all levels
have also extended great efforts to teach people to cherish the
natural environment and protect wild animals and plants.

<HEADLINE> Malawi's Biggest River Drying Up: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Malawi's biggest river, which
supplies water for the country's hydro-electric power plants and
major industrial city Blantyre, is shrinking and may dry up
entirely as a result of falling water levels in Lake Malawi.
</P>
<P>
Zambia News Agency quoted Richard Watts, Professor of
Hydrology at the University of Malawi, said Tuesday that the
Shire river is already very shallow and the declining water level
of Lake Malawi, can gradually dry the river up.
</P>
<P>
Unless the shallow strip between the Shire river and Lake
Malawi is dredged to increase its depth or large pumps are
installed to pump water into the river, hydro-electric schemes in
southern Malawi will be seriously affected, Watts warned.
</P>
<P>
The Shire river, which originates from Lake Malawi, the third
largest lake in central Africa with an area of 28,678 square
kilometers, runs about 500 kilometers from the north to the
south. On the middle of the river, three hydro-electric power
plants have been set up and they account for 76 percent of hydro
capacity in the country.
</P>
<P>
Blantyre, the country's major industrial city, and sugar
plantations on the lower Shire in southern Malawi, also get their
water supply from the Shire river.
</P>
<P>
Hydrologists say the level of Lake Malawi has been dropping
over the past five years and will drop to about 473 meters above
the sea level by October this year.
</P>
<P>
Historical records show that water level of the lake once fell
to 469.9 meters at the beginning of the 20th century, which led
to the complete drying up of the Shire river.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the British Institute of Hydrology who recently
conducted a study on Lake Malawi also warned that problems could
occur if the water level dips too low.
</P>
<P>
The possibility of a return to historically low levels is of
great concern to hydrologists and engineers, particularly in
relation to the maintenance and planning of future hydro-power
developments, the institute said in a report.
</P>
<P>
The serious effect in the future of the Shire river's drying
up has made Malawi's electricity supply authorities map out
contingency plans to avert power cuts.
</P>
<P>
Raynold Duncan, Chief Executive of the Electricity Supply
Commission of Malawi (ESCOM) disclosed that the commission plans
to build a dam to control the flow of water in the Shire river
and studies are underway to explore the use of coal in power
generation.
</P>
<P>
ESCOM is also discussing importing power from Mozambique,
Duncan added.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 24 (Xinhua) -- South Korea urged the United
States and Japan Wednesday to maintain transparency in coming up
with any "joint military operation strategies" and "cooperation
plans" under the New Defense Guidelines.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the Foreign Ministry paid attention to the parts of
the new guidelines that call for the observation of the basic format
of the U.S.-Japan security alliance, engagement in activities only for
defensive purpose under the Japanese Constitution and the principle of
denuclearization.
</P>
<P>
It hoped that Tokyo and Washington will continue to closely
consult with Seoul on issues which involve South Korea's
sovereignty in connection with the implementation of the new
defense guidelines which was agreed upon on Tuesday to replace the
1978 guidelines.
</P>
<P>
The new guidelines allow Japanese forces to operate in emergency
situations in surrounding areas in support of American troops,
triggering concerns over the expanded role of the Japanese military
among Asian neighbors, which suffered from Japanese militarism during
and before World War II.

<HEADLINE> Sydney Olympics to Avoid "Commercial Feeding Frenzy" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- International Olympic
Committee marketing chief Michael Payne said in Sydney that he was
confident Sydney would avoid a "commercial feeding frenzy" seen in
Atlanta which was worse than the IOC could have imagined.
</P>
<P>
Payne, the IOC's Worldwide Marketing Director, said the city of
Atlanta had worked "actively against the organizing committee" but
Sydney would be guarded from that because of its partnership
between government and business.
</P>
<P>
Payne, in Sydney to attend a sponsor's workshop for the next
four Olympics, summer and winter, talked of the problems of ambush
marketing, where advertisers try to cash in on the Games without
paying for rights.
</P>
<P>
Payne said:"You're here as the host city, you want to put your
best foot forward to the world, you don't want to confuse the
presentation, and we found that the city turned it into a
commercial feeding frenzy outside of the official sponsors.
</P>
<P>
"That's what the world saw and that was a serious problem which
sadly, a year before the Games, the IOC had already identified.
(But) even in our wildest dreams we didn't think it would be that
bad."
</P>
<P>
He added:"If you want to talk about ambush marketing, the city
ambushed itself -- that was the biggest ambush incident in
Atlanta."

<HEADLINE> Huge Tumor Removed from Baby Boy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 24 (Xinhua) -- A tumor bigger than a table
tennis paddle has been removed from the facial area of a
five-month-old baby boy in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The tumor, weighing 1,500 grams or one fourth of the baby's
total weight, had grown around his common carotid artery,
hypoglossal nerve and vagus nerve, making the surgery complicated
and dangerous, according to surgeons with the No.9 People's
Hospital of Shanghai, in east China.
</P>
<P>
The baby boy, named Li Lancheng, was born with the tumor, which
at the time of his birth was as large as his head, his parents
said. They said they did not allow him to sleep on his back
for fear he would strangle.
</P>
<P>
Surgeons completely removed the tumor in a six-hour operation
on August 26. Baby Li was discharged and is recovering at home,
according to hospital sources.

<HEADLINE> India Needs More Time to Fully Float Rupee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 24 (Xinhua) -- An earlier three-year
schedule for implementing full convertibility of the rupee is
likely to be stretched to five years in India, a government
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
A delayed time-table is being considered due to growing concern
within the Finance Ministry over sporadic export growth and the
extreme volatility of the rupee.
</P>
<P>
A high-level committee headed by Finance Secretary Montek Singh
Ahluwalia reportedly favors deferring all major measures for
introducing full convertibility till the government is convinced
that the country is on track for sustained and robust export
growth, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Export growth in the country has been sporadic during the first
five years of liberalization, with 1991-93 witnessing average
annual growth of less than five percent. From 1993-94 to 1995-96,
however, exports grew at an annual average of 20 percent. Export
growth again slumped to 1.8 percent in April-July this year, he
further said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Finance Ministry has been concerned about
the rupee's volatility on the foreign exchange front in the
country. The post-budget months saw the appreciation of the rupee
while it has depreciated substantially after August 21. The
government had to move in with policy measures to "soft land" the
rupee.

<HEADLINE> 11th World Meat Congress Opens in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The 11th World Meat Congress
convened here Tuesday, the first of its kind ever hosted
by the International Meat Secretariat in an Asian country.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing attended the opening ceremony
of the three-day event, which attracted 600 deputies from 35
countries.
</P>
<P>
With a theme of improving the quality of meat products to
ensure customers' satisfaction, participants will discuss issues
ranging from prospects for the international meat trade, the
development of the meat trade in the Asian-Pacific region and the
opportunities for import and export of meat.
</P>
<P>
Participants will also study the economic, legal and
environmental aspects of meat production, processing, technology
and trade, and exchange production experience.
</P>
<P>
In his address at the opening ceremony, the vice premier said
that the congress provides a good opportunity not only for people
from other countries to learn more about China's meat production,
but also for Chinese meat production enterprises to enter the
world market.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the Chinese central government has launched a
nationwide "vegetable basket" scheme aiming at improving the
supply of non-staple foodstuffs for urban residents. It has also
worked to develop meat, poultry and egg production, which has
played a positive role in stabilizing prices in the non-staple
food market, said the vice-premier.
</P>
<P>
At present, rural and urban markets are full of a variety of
goods. Per capita availability of meat products, poultry and eggs
has exceeded the world average, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier said that the Chinese government would
continue to support enterprises to expand cooperation with
their overseas partners and jointly explore the international meat
market.

<HEADLINE> Qian: Jiang's U.S. Visit Will Boost Sino-U.S. Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin's state visit to the United States this fall will boost
Sino-U.S. relations to a new stage of development, Qian Qichen,
Chinese vice premier and foreign minister, said here today.
</P>
<P>
Before meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
this evening, Qian told a joint news conference that he would
discuss with his U.S. counterpart preparations for the visit.
</P>
<P>
"We will review the achievements both countries have made in
the recent past and will continue the exchange of views on matters
concerning the impending visit," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Qian, who is here to attend the 52nd session of the United
Nations General Assembly, said he would discuss with Albright a
number of other matters during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese government is ready to work with the
U.S. government to achieve greater progress.
</P>
<P>
He suggested the two countries find ways to settle their
differences in promoting good relations.
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to point out that the question of Taiwan has always
been an important issue in Sino-U.S. relations, and that is also
the issue of utmost concern to the Chinese," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the U.S. will take real actions to honor the principle
enshrined in the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques, handle the
question of Taiwan with prudence, and no longer allow this
question to interfere with the progress and growth of
Sino-U.S. relations," said Qian.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes his meeting with Albright could contribute
to the further improvement of relations between the two countries
and create favorable conditions for President Jiang's visit to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Albright said progress has been made in preparation for the
Chinese President's visit. "We will continue to lay the
basis for a sound and constructive relationship between the United
States and China."
</P>
<P>
Albright stressed that such a relationship will conform to the
interests of the American people.

<HEADLINE> Food Insecurity to Appear in Nepal: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Nepal will face a situation
of food insecurity within five or six years as the country's
agricultural sector has not been able to keep pace with population
growth, a report warns.
</P>
<P>
Despite Nepal's best efforts, performance in the agricultural
sector has been below the expected level, said the report issued
by the Special Program on Food Production in Support of Food
Security in Nepal (SPIN).
</P>
<P>
And the country's population is expected to reach about 24
million by 2002/2003, while the food production will experience a
deficit of 251,120 metric tons, today's newspapers quoted the
report as saying.
</P>
<P>
"To contain this situation, priority must be on improving the
capacity of the higher potential agricultural land to support the
expanding population of the country," said the report.
</P>
<P>
S.B. Mathema, team leader of the SPIN, said Nepal has the
potential to increase food grain production and the suitable
technologies are available within the country.
</P>
<P>
"Food security is not achieved mainly because of lack of
dissemination of recommended package of technologies in larger
areas," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali Ministry of Agriculture and the UN Food and
Agriculture Organization jointly launched a pilot project of the
SPIN in October 1995 to boost food production so as to meet
growing demand and help eradicate food insecurity.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government will made
a further cut of 50-60 billion baht (1.4-1.7 billion US dollars)
from its 1997-1998 fiscal year budget, a senior Thai official
said.
</P>
<P>
The budget was drafted to meet a requirement of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), Thai Deputy Finance Minister
Chaturon Chaisaeng was quoted as saying by local newspapers today.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government earlier had cut 59 billion baht (1.7
billion dollars) from its 1997-1998 fiscal budget of 984 billion
baht (28.1 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The additional budget cut reportedly was made as the country's
tax revenues are expected to fall short of the target.
</P>
<P>
The axe will mainly fall on projects of low priority, which use
foreign currencies or are carried out in subsequent years,
Chaturon said.
</P>
<P>
The budget for education and public health will remain intact,
he added.

<HEADLINE> Western Countries Urge India to Relax Import Curbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The United States and
European countries, India's major trading partners, have urged
India to further ease its import curbs, official sources said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The western countries have indicated they would ask for a
dispute settlement panel to be set up if India did not revise its
offer on the removal of import curbs.
</P>
<P>
While India has offered to remove almost 50 percent of the US
priority items during the first phase over a period of three
years, the US has been seeking removal of 1,680 tariff lines which
constitute 61 percent of the priority items.
</P>
<P>
India has proposed to remove its import curbs in six to seven
years. The developed countries are insisting that India must
indicate a year-by-year time schedule which lists out when each
tariff line will be put on the open general license list. India
has so far refused to say when exactly the items will be freed.
</P>
<P>
The trading partners have said that they would ask for the
setting up of a dispute panel on the issue unless India comes
forward with a new revised offer. After the filing of a request
for such a panel, another 30 days are allowed for the country to
appeal against the setting up of the panel.

<HEADLINE> Artificial Rainfall Helps Relieve Drought in Northwest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Cloud-seeding and other
techniques for making artificial rain have helped to relieve
drought in this arid land of northwest China.
</P>
<P>
Since early this year, Gansu Province has sent 28 planes,
flying a total of more than 30,000 kilometers, to produce 700
million cubic meters of artificial rainfall through a process
known as cloud-seeding, in which chemicals are released into the
clouds to produce rain.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another technique which uses artillery shells to
melt hailstones in the sky, has been used more than 1,000 times,
to prevent crop damage from hail and increase the amount of rain.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Gansu was hit by a serious drought which covered a
large part of the province and lasted for months. The local
government sent 43 planes for cloud-seeding in the spring, summer
and autumn, and created 890 million cubic meters of rain.
</P>
<P>
In Yongchang County, where the drought had lingered for 75
days, the water supply in the country reservoir was increased by
12 million cubic meters through artificial rainfall.
</P>
<P>
The grain output of the county was rose by eight million kg,
which meant that for each yuan spent in making artificial rain,
grain output volume increased by more than eight million kg.
</P>
<P>
Located in northwest China, Gansu is often plagued by drought
and hailstorms, said Xie Jinnan, director of the province's
meteorological bureau.
</P>
<P>
In the past six years, 51 of the province's 86 counties have
been benefited from the artificial rainfall, which guaranteed the
good harvests in these years.

<HEADLINE> Italy Promises New Boost for Ties With Latin America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Italy is ready to lend new drive
to further political, economic and cultural relations with Latin
American countries, Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi said today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting of some 20 Latin American ambassadors to
Rome, who gathered for the new quarters of the Italian-Latin
American Institute (ILA), Prodi said his government was aware that
relations with Latin American countries failed to fulfill their
potentialities in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Latin America is now at the center of attention in North
America and Europe and is not from a "colonialist" point of
view. Thus, a new era for these relations can be spoken of, the
premier said.
</P>
<P>
Recalling that Latin American nations have given rise to four
common markets and nine free trade treaties, Prodi said he
believed that the impressive economic development now visible in
Latin America would lead to "prolonged growth over time because it
is based on relations of cooperation among the states and
especially on democracy."

<HEADLINE> Doctors House Calls,  New Trend in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Responding to an emergency
medical call, doctors and nurses rushed to the home of 90-year-old
Li Boliang, who had slipped into a coma caused by a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to their speedy reaction, the "angels in white" were
able to revive the elderly man.
</P>
<P>
More and more doctors in Shanghai are making house calls, a new
trend which Chinese experts say is the result of the people's
increasing demand for better medical services and their
higher living standards.
</P>
<P>
And a group of medical service stations have opened in the
country's commercial center to deliver medical treatment right to
a patient's doorstep.
</P>
<P>
Hospitals in the Jingan District recently organized a
first-aid team and published their pager numbers. Over the past few
months, doctors and nurses shuttling between hospitals and
patients' homes have provided services to more than 300 patients,
including a 109-year-old man and a two-month-old baby.
</P>
<P>
Medical service contracts have also become popular in the east
China city. Some 250 families in one residential quarter have
signed agreements with medical facilities nearby.
</P>
<P>
"We pay 40 yuan per year, then each member of my family may
have a free medical examination in the year," said a housewife,
adding that doctors will come to her home a few times a year to
give health care advices.
</P>
<P>
The city said that some 200 additional medical stations are
expected to open by the end of this year, offering treatment
as well as information on disease prevention and health care, and
psychological counseling.

<HEADLINE> Russia, U.S. Cooperation Improved: Yeltsin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris
Yeltsin said here today that cooperation between Russia with the
United States has been markedly improved in the areas of concern
established at this year's Russia-U.S. summit.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin made the remark while meeting with visiting
U.S. Vice-President Al Gore, who arrived in Moscow on Sunday and
attended the ninth meeting of the Russia-U.S. Economic and
Technological Cooperation Commission on Monday, according to the
President Press Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president praised the commission, saying that
bilateral trade has doubled since the commission was established
four years ago.
</P>
<P>
The joint research program on space is a symbol of the new
relationship between the two countries, Yeltsin added.
</P>
<P>
However, Yeltsin went on to say, the fact that U.S. laws do not
recognize Russia as a market-oriented country, as well as the
harsh conditions set for Russia to join the World Trade
Organization (WTO) have hindered the development of more favorable
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
It is not acceptable that certain Americans intend to announce
some areas of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) as
"U.S. special interests region," and force Russia out of them, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Gore said the U.S. did not want to set up its own spheres of
influence, or try to force Russia away from the region while
developing relations with other members of the CIS.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. is preparing to consolidate the stability and
peace in CIS hot areas with Russia and to pave the way for
mutually beneficial trade in the region.

<P>
JAKARTA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Two people have died after
suffering respiratory problems caused by haze, which has been
choking dozens of towns in Sumatra and Kalimantan, Indonesia, an
official said.
</P>
<P>
The two deaths were the first officially recognized fatalities
related to the haze menace, but the official from the Ministry of
People's Welfare declined Tuesday to give details about the
victims, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Suyono, a secretary of the ministry, said more than 32,000
people in Sumatra and Kalimantan have been afflicted with severe
respiratory problems in the last two months by the haze which came
from forest fires there.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said that at least 15 forest concession areas
or 400,000 hectares were being razed by fires and 12,000 hectares
were in serious blaze.
</P>
<P>
They estimated that about 20 million people are in danger of
respiratory problems in the country as well as in Malaysia and
Singapore which have also been affected by the haze.
</P>
<P>
Suyono said the government has decided to ask people living
near forest fires to wear a mask to prevent possible diseases.
</P>
<P>
He said people were also requested not to bring children below
ten years old outside their homes while haze was thick.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's four leftist
parties in the ruling People's Alliance government have called on
the main opposition United National Party (UNP) to support the
government's peace proposals, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Lanka Equal Society Party, the Sri Lanka People's Party,
the National Liberation People's Party and the Communist Party
held a joint demonstration in Colombo on Tuesday calling for an
end to the ethnic war and the speedy implementation of the
devolution package.
</P>
<P>
Under the package, more autonomy would be given to Northern and
Eastern provinces, where the Tamil rebels have been fighting a
guerrilla war for a separate state since 1983.
</P>
<P>
The parties urged the UNP to carefully study the proposals and
give their support. The devolution proposals need to win a
two-thirds majority in the 225-seat parliament. The UNP, which
holds 94 parliament seats, hasn't expressed its support yet.
</P>
<P>
The leftists believe that the devolution bill was the only way
to end the ethnic crisis and ensure amity among different
communities.

<HEADLINE> China to Aid More Poor College Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, September 24 (Xinhua) -- China will step up efforts to
establish an efficient system for giving financial aid to poor
college students.
</P>
<P>
The central government has allocated 100 million yuan (12
million US dollars) this year to aid poor students in
ministry-managed colleges and universities, Yang Zhoufu, an
official of the State Education Commission (SEC), was quoted by
today's China Daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
Most local educational departments, colleges and universities
have also taken measures to help poor students, Yang said at a
national conference on aiding poor students being held in central
China's Wuhan city.
</P>
<P>
According to a report released at the meeting, most provinces
and cities have started setting up aid funds including
scholarship, loans, subsidies, work-for-study programs and
tuition-reduction or exemption schemes.
</P>
<P>
The report said that loans will be provided to less well-off
students by the colleges and universities, at an average of 2,000
yuan (240 US dollars) each year.
</P>
<P>
The loans will be awarded on a zero-interest basis with
guarantees. A national loan fund will be established in Beijing to
supervise the administration of the loans.
</P>
<P>
Twenty percent of college students will benefit from the loans,
Yang said.
</P>
<P>
China has 2.8 million college students on campus. Twenty
percent of them are in financial difficulties, and seven percent
of them live in remote and poor areas where annual family incomes
are below 1,000 yuan (120 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The tuition payment system has been thoroughly introduced to
colleges from this autumn's semester, replacing the former
tuition-free system. Students are required to pay 10 to 20 percent
of all education fees.

<HEADLINE> Panama Begins Cattle Exportation to Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Panama sent its first
shipment of young bulls to Colombia today, initiating a cattle
exportation program to its southern neighbor.
</P>
<P>
Virgilio Samaniego, president of the "Azuero" slaughter house,
told reporters that in Panama's central provinces there is a
surplus of young bulls waiting to be exported to Colombia, where
there is a strong demand for beef and breeders are well paid and
earn a good profit.
</P>
<P>
The exports could eventually provide some assistance in helping
the country's economy to recover, Samaniego said.
</P>
<P>
He added that in recent years, Panama's cattle industry has
faced many problems. One of the most serious problems affecting
the country this year is the late drought, which is occurring in
many Panamanian provinces. Farmers and forecasters are blaming the
problem on the weather phenomenon called 'El Nino.'
</P>
<P>
"We asked the government to provide us with 300,000 tons of
cane to feed some 400,000 head of cattle to help ease the crisis,
but we did not receive any support from them," Samaniego said.
</P>
<P>
He added, however, that by using some of the funds from
exportation-related income, the country's agriculture and cattle
sectors have finally managed to ease the crisis.

<HEADLINE> World Food Program Praised for Success of Projects in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 24 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese senior official
Tuesday praised the support of the World Food Program (WFP) as
significantly contributing to China's efforts to alleviate
poverty, Today's China Daily said.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the cooperative projects with WFP are successful,"
said Gao Hongbin, director-general of the State Council Leading
Group Office for Poverty Alleviation and Development.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar sponsored by WFP China, Gao emphasized
the role of the WFP in China's campaign to eradicate poverty in
rural areas by the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
"By reducing poverty among the population of China, WFP's
programs also contribute to the world," Gao said.
</P>
<P>
At present, the WFP has carried out 59 food-aid programs in
China totalling 768 million US dollars. The recipients cover 184
of China's municipalities and counties, with a total population of
more than 22.3 million.
</P>
<P>
Although, as a result of China's 15 years of work to alleviate
poverty, only 7.1 percent of the rural population are living in
poverty, the existing 58 million people living at or below the
poverty line still pose an arduous task. Almost all these people
are in the central and western parts of the country, living in high
or rocky mountainous areas, deserts, or on the Loess Plateau --
often in ethnic minority regions.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the international poverty level set at a per
capita income of 365 US dollars annually (3,030 yuan), China's
poverty level is 500 yuan (60 US dollars). The per capita income
of China's 800-million rural population reached 1,500 yuan (181 US
dollars) last year.

<HEADLINE> Program Launched to Help Poor Farmers in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Since the economic miracle of
the early 1980s enriched millions of farmers, China has turned its
attention to the 58 million needy people in rural areas, reported
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Civil Affairs, China offers
800 million yuan (96 million US dollars) for social relief every
year.
</P>
<P>
The country last year implemented a program to ensure a minimum
cost of living for the impoverished. The program has, up to now,
covered 3.38 million poor farmers in 450 counties throughout the
country.
</P>
<P>
No national minimum standard of cost of living has been set,
due to the gap in economic growth between eastern and western
regions. The standard varies from area to area, said Liao Hong, an
official from the Ministry of Civil Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The western area, where the destitute is concentrated, needs
more financial aid from both the central and local governments.
</P>
<P>
With limited funds, county governments were quite strict in
identifying needy individuals. Farmers must apply to the village
committees and get approval by the local township governments
before they are granted a card for receiving relief.
</P>
<P>
People who become deficient because of gambling, extravagance
in building houses or wedding and funeral ceremonies are not
allowed to benefit from the program.
</P>
<P>
Local governments also exempted the agriculture tax and offered
free health care and education to cash-trapped people.
</P>
<P>
Farmers who have children in the army and are unable to take
care of themselves also enjoy the preferential policy.
</P>
<P>
As part of the program, China offers two billion yuan (240
million US dollars) for disaster relief every year.
</P>
<P>
People who suffer from a sudden natural disaster can hope to
receive help to meet their basic needs.
</P>
<P>
An old-age pension, as part of an overall rural social security
system sponsored by the government, will be set up to help aged
people, who most likely become poor when they cannot till the
land.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Civil Affairs, one-fifth of people
aged between 20 and 60 in rural areas have now bought an old-age
pension.

<HEADLINE> Changyu Wine Listing A Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 24 (Xinhua) -- China's biggest wine maker
was listed in Shenzhen Tuesday on the B-share market, designed to
attract overseas investors, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Despite weak market interest, shares in the Changyu Pioneer
Wine Co. made a satisfactory debut, rising 0.45 to 3.70 HK dollars
from their issue price of 3.25 HK dollars.
</P>
<P>
Fear of the accelerated expansion of Chinese stock markets
announced at the 15th National Congress of the Chinese Communist
Party caused share prices in Shenzhen to fall sharply, losing 13
percent in the first two trading days of the week.
</P>
<P>
Even in such an unfavorable market environment, Changyu shares
reached a high of 3.90 HK dollars after opening at 3.60 HK
dollars, and were the most actively traded with 12.05 million
shares changing hands.
</P>
<P>
In anticipation of a bright future for China's wine industry,
the company's 88 million B-shares had attracted active interest
from overseas investors when they were issued at the beginning of
September.
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from the issue, amounting to 280 million yuan (33.7
million US dollars), would be used to fund the company's expansion
program to raise wine production to 73,000 tons by 1999 from the
current level of 40,000 tons, said company president Sun Liqiang.
</P>
<P>
The company plans to raise further funds for expansion by
listing on the A-share market -- which is for domestic investors
-- next year, he said.

<HEADLINE> "El Nino" Effects May Last Until 1998: Peruvian Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The weather effects as a result
of the "El Nino" climatic phenomenon may last until June 1998,
Peruvian experts have predicted.
</P>
<P>
The extension of such effects are accumulating a huge mass of
warm water in the sea, Pablo Lagos, Director of the Peru Institute
of Geophysics (PIG) was quoted as saying by the local press today.
</P>
<P>
The scientist said this abnormality is caused by sudden
west-to-east changes in the direction of trade winds in the
western Pacific.
</P>
<P>
Such a fact could be increasing a phenomenon called
"Thermoclimate," or hot water strips, which are getting
progressively deeper and raising the temperature not to a normal
of 4 or 5 degrees Celsius, but 6 or even 7 degrees Celsius.
</P>
<P>
Lagos said heavy rains are expected in north of Peru, from next
November on and also in the "Sierra Central" zone. He urged
competent authorities to take necessary actions to to counter
possible problems.
</P>
<P>
For his part, PIG president Ronald Woodman said the 1998 "El
Nino" phenomenon would be as intense as the one which occurred in
the 1982-1983 period.
</P>
<P>
He said that as a result of such a phenomenon, overwhelming
rains are expected over the northern coast of Peru.

<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian soccer club
Vitoria Tuesday suspended the wages of the striker Bebeto and
accused him of indiscipline.
</P>

Club president Paulo Carneiro said Bebeto was in Rio de Janeiro
and refused to return to the club, which is based in the
North-Eastern city of Salvador.
</P>

The furious club president said that they also thought of
suspending the contract with Bebeto.

Bebeto, 33, who help Brazil to the World Cup title in 1994
together with Romario, has 62 full international caps and has
scored 32 goals for Brazil.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rica to Combat Deadly Hanta Virus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Costa Rican government
is planning a series of preventive measures to combat the Hanta
Virus, which is the cause of a highly contagious disease that has
resulted in death in nearly 50 percent of the cases reported, the
Health Ministry reported today.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Minister of Health Fernando Marin said the ministry will
provide special training for physicians that will enable them to
detect the virus and infected individuals.
</P>
<P>
He called on all Costa Ricans to improve their health habits
and to try and improve their living conditions, such as washing
their hands before meals, making sure that food is cooked properly
and thoroughly before eating, and to make sure that food is
properly stored.
</P>
<P>
This year the government says it will provide medical equipment
capable of detecting the presence of the virus in individuals if
and when they enter Costa Rican territory, said Marin.
</P>
<P>
According to the Pan American Health Organization, the virus is
transmitted by rodents, primarily from their droppings, and also
rotten food.
</P>
<P>
The disease causes fever, breathing difficulties, headache and
stomach ache, internal hemorrhaging and vomiting.
</P>
<P>
It is possible that the Hanta Virus could spread over all Latin
American countries if it is not controlled.
</P>
<P>
An outbreak of the virus took place in a Chilean rural area
called Arica, which borders Peru and Bolivia; one person
reportedly died from the infection.

<HEADLINE> Former Coal Miners, Now Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Some 1,500 laid-off coal
miners in Central China's Hunan province are now busy farming on
local barren hillsides.
</P>
<P>
Since most of Hunan's coal mines are located in remote hilly
land, the province has encouraged laid-off workers there to switch
to agriculture to earn a living.
</P>
<P>
The Luota Coal Mine, located in the western part of the
province, called on its staff to grow Chinese chestnuts, ginger
and tobacco on 85 hectares of land on barren hillsides.
</P>
<P>
They also raised more than 800 goats.
</P>
<P>
"We are working hard for a good harvest," said one
miner-turned farmer.
</P>
<P>
Some coal mining companies have also joined hands with villages
nearby for agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
The Zixing Coal Mining Administration signed a contract with a
local feed-processing company to co-produce fodder. They rented a
piece of land from the city government to grow sweet potatoes,
which has given 900-plus laid-off workers new jobs.
</P>
<P>
The administration also rented a reservoir for its 100 laid-off
workers to raise 200,000 fish and 6,000 ducks, and the output
value is expected to hit 2.6 million yuan this year.

<HEADLINE> Overseas-Funded Firms Playing Bigger Role in North Chinese City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Tianjin, in north China, has
over 10,000 foreign-funded enterprises with a total investment of
20 billion US dollars and uses more than five billion US dollars
in overseas funds annually.
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, however, it was less than two billion US
dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
The city has 90 large overseas-funded enterprises with ten
million US dollars in investment each, nearly three times the
figure five years ago. Annual exports of the foreign-funded firms
have risen to two billion US dollars in five years, from only 200
million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, 74 enterprises added 365
million US dollars to their projects. The firms are expected to
account for 53.15 percent of Tianjin's total exports this year.
</P>
<P>
Many internationally-known brands are produced in Tianjin, like
Dynasty wines, Otis elevators, Motorola communications equipment,
and Shell oil. Overseas-funded firms are mainly involved in
electronics, engineering, and chemical and medical industries, and
employ more than 200,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 4,000 of the city's overseas-funded firms are in the
Tianjin Economic Development Area in the Binhai New Area, an
integrated development area involved in international trade and
transportation, export industry, and finances.
</P>
<P>
The zone now accounts for 60 percent of the total industrial
output value and export volume in Binhai.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that Tianjin's economic development will
largely depend on the zone in future and the foreign-funded firms
are expected to play an even greater role in the local economy.

<HEADLINE> OCA Decides Thailand Continue to Host 1998 Asian Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Executive Board of
the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) today decided to continue give
the chance of hosting the 1998 Asian games to Bangkok, Thailand,
although concerns over the preparations for the games still
remain.
</P>
<P>
President of OCA, a Kuwaiti Prince, Ahmad Fahd Al-Sabah told a
press conference after a four hour meeting of the Executive Board
that this is the final decision concerning the hosting right of
Bangkok which was made 14 months ahead of the games to be held in
December 1998.
</P>
<P>
He said the members of the board examined and discussed the
situation in Bangkok and the progress of the preparations for the
game and a Memorandum of Agreement was reached.
</P>
<P>
He added that a meeting of the OCA would be held on December 15
to be followed by meetings of all sub-committees to carry out
examinations of various aspects of the games preparations.
</P>
<P>
Bangkok won the right to hold the games seven years ago. But
OCA officials said there had been very little progress in
preparing for the event and that there was major disorganization
in the organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
The OCA called the emergency meeting last month last month
amid growing doubts over the success of the games following a
spate of resignations of the Bangkok Asian Games Organizing
Committee (BAGOC), unsigned sponsorship contracts and accusations
of political meddling in the games organization.
</P>
<P>
A 43-member delegation arrived in Kuwait well before the
meeting was held this afternoon to convince the board members on
Thailand's ability and readiness to host the 1998 Asian games.
</P>
<P>
The BAGOC has given new assurance to the OCA that the
preparations in all respects would be completed three months
ahead of the games schedule.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sabah said that "as OCA, we will keep following the
preparations of the Bangkok Asian Games Organizing Committee if
they are ready to solve all the problems" surrounding the
preparations.
</P>
<P>
He also said "I feel more comfortable and more trust in
Bangkok to continue the preparations for the games."
</P>
<P>
Bangkok hosted three previous Asian games in the past with the
first being in 1966, the second in 1970 and the third in 1978.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sabah hopes the Bangkok Asian games would reach the level of
last Hiroshima games which he thought was one of best games held

<HEADLINE> Child Gun Toll Down in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The number of children and
teen-agers killed by guns dropped in 1995 for the first time in
more than a decade, according to government statistics released
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The information was released by the Children Defense Fund and
confirmed by the National Center for Health Statistics. The
statistics were available in July but had not been broken down to
focus on Americans aged 19 and under.
</P>
<P>
Overall, 5,285 people aged 19 and under were killed by guns in
1995, a 9.4 percent drop from 1994.
</P>
<P>
But there are still 14 children and teen-agers killed by guns
each day, on average.
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to take too much joy in that, but 14 is better than
16," said Kim Wade, assistant general counsel of the fund.
</P>
<P>
The number and rate of gun deaths have been climbing since
1983, when just under 3,000 children and teens were killed by
guns.
</P>
<P>
Six in 10 of the deaths are homicides, which have fallen two
years in a row. But the drop in 1995 was dramatic -- 9.2 percent
-- driving the overall death rate down to seven deaths out of
every 100,000 Americans under 19, said Lois Fingerhut, an analyst
with the government's statistics office.
</P>
<P>
The homicide rate has been dropping for adults, as well.
</P>
<P>
Suicides dropped 7.3 percent to 1,450 in 1995, and
unintentional deaths dropped 14.1 percent, to 440.
</P>
<P>
Also Tuesday, children's hospitals announced a campaign to
highlight accidental deaths that occur when a child finds a
parent's gun. Public service advertisements are set to appear in
30 national magazines, and children's hospitals in more than 100
cities will ask local television stations to run them.

BONN, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia
blew past former French Open champions Spaniard Sergi Bruguera
with two straight sets at the Grand Slam Cup tennis tournament on
Tuesday in Munich, Germany.
</P>
<P>
Russian Kafelnikov, who won on the Paris clay last year,
crushed Bruguera, who triumphed in the French capital in 1993 and
1994, 6-4, 6-3 in 73 minutes.
</P>

The quick, synthetic surface of Munich's Olympia Halle gave
Kafelnikov advantage to use his powerful groundstrokes to make the
match a one-side affair.
</P>
<P>
Kafelnikov, who made sure of 250,000 U.S. dollars in prize
money, will face either Briton Greg Rusedski or Australian Todd
Woodbridge for a place in the semi-finals.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Government Lay Out Plans for the Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government said
today that it's time to start reinvesting in the future now that
it has almost won the battle against the deficit.
</P>
<P>
In a throne speech to open the 36th parliament, the government
laid out its plans for the next few years.
</P>
<P>
"Stimulating job creation and economic growth has been,
remains, and will continue to be a major objective of the
government of Canada," said the speech, which was read in the
Senate by Governor General Romeo LeBlanc on behalf of Jean
Chretien's government.
</P>
<P>
The government will continue its present course and take
further action to encourage new investment, to create new jobs,
and to generate the national wealth.
</P>
<P>
It also predicted that the budget will be balanced "no later
than fiscal year 1998-99", that is, no later than March 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
"The government has regained the ability to address priorities
of Canadians while living within its means," the speech declared.
</P>
<P>
"It is now in the position to take strategic investments in our
children and our youth, our health, our communities, and our
knowledge and creativity while continuing to improve the nation's
finances," it said.
</P>
<P>
The government promised today to eventually double the 850
million dollars (610 million USD) in federal tax credits for poor
families.
</P>
<P>
And a "children's agenda" promised in the June election will be
put together in collaboration with the provinces.
</P>
<P>
On the medicare front, the government will bring in legislation
cementing a promise to stabilize health funding for the provinces.
</P>
<P>
It will also work with the provinces on promises to expand
medicare by setting up pharmacare and home care pilot projects.
</P>
<P>
The government also promised an effort to boost high-tech
industries like aerospace, pharmaceuticals and telecommunications
and to help small businesses.
</P>
<P>
On the touchy issue of national unity, the government said it
will "take a very broad and encompassing approach to promoting and
strengthening our unity."
</P>
<P>
"The government will bring frankness and clarity to any debate
that puts into question the future existence or unity of Canada,"
and will ensure Quebecers have a better idea of "the true
complexity and difficulty" with respect to separation.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts here say that the throne speech emphasized the
"stay the course" approach adopted by the ruling Liberals in the
Spring campaign, and contained few new ideas.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, British Foreign Ministers Talk over Links </HEADLINE>

the transition of Hong Kong's sovereignty earlier this year. Both
sides expressed the willingness to further the bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
He said that now the two countries are preparing for the

such exchanges between China and Europe.

adding that the smooth hand-over of Hong Kong was made possible by
the cooperative efforts. He said that the bilateral economic and
trade relations are showing a good development trend and
potentials for further expansion.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Blair and other ministerial officials and he
himself are all looking forward to the China visit at an early
date. He agreed on Qian's view that countries should replace
confrontation with cooperation and dialogues in international
affairs.
</P>
<P>
On the reform of the United Nations, the Chinese foreign
minister said that reform should U.N. reform should reflect the
will of developing countries and the needs of different regions.

states, and serve the two goals of peace and development.
</P>
<P>

finance and navigation and other international issues of common
concern.

<HEADLINE> White House Says no Change in U.S. Bosnia Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The White House, after a
senior official stresses the need for a further stay of
peacekeepers in Bosnia beyond next Summer, today said that the
United States will not change its policy on Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and other nations must stay in Bosnia for a further
period after the current peacekeeping mission ends in Bosnia next
June to ensure peace takes hold, White House national security
adviser Sandy Berger said earlier today.
</P>
<P>
After Berger's speech at Georgetown University, White House
Michael McCurry said his address wasn't meant to signal change in
U.S. policy on Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
"He has not shifted the ground on the president's determination
to meet the timetable" for withdrawing current troops, said
McCurry, who explained the speech was aimed at the "cut-and-run
crowd."
</P>
<P>
"It's a direct response to those that have said somehow or
other we can walk away from this international tragedy and leave
it to others to continue to do the work of rebuilding civil
society in Bosnia-Herzegovina in the aftermath of the worst ethnic
and military conflict in Europe since World War II," McCurry told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
In the major speech at the Georgetown University, Berger
cautioned that an early pullout could risk war in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The Stabilization Force (SFOR) in Bosnia, led by the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), will end its mission in June
1998 as scheduled, Berger said.
</P>
<P>
But Berger emphasized what President Bill Clinton and Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright have indicated for months that "the
international community's engagement will continue" beyond the
deadline.
</P>
<P>
However, he failed to point out how long the multinational
forces should stay in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Berger acknowledged that "progress is painfully slow on many
fronts."
</P>
<P>
"Less than two years after Dayton (Agreement was signed) and
after so much devastation, the job is far from done," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Bosnia still stands on a tightrope, inching towards a better
future but still not past the point of danger," Berger added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the prominent indicted war criminals "remain at
large," large majority of refugees remain unable to return home,
the Bosnian Serbs are "in the grip of an intense struggle and the
media isn't independent; and economic reconstruction is spotty.
</P>
<P>
"We should not give up on justice and reward aggression,"
Berger said. "Partition also would be wrong because it would send
the message to ethnic fanatics everywhere that the international
community will allow redrawing of borders by force."
</P>
<P>
Ending the commitment in the region could undermine NATO and
lead to more bloodshed in Bosnia and beyond, Berger said.
</P>
<P>
"If (the) Dayton (peace agreement) fails, Bosnia will almost
certainly slide back into conflict, potentially leading to a wider
war in Southeastern Europe," Berger said.
</P>
<P>
"It would undermine NATO's credibility at a critical moment
when the alliance is preparing for new members and new missions,"
he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier
and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and Nepalese Foreign Minister
Kamal Thapa today expressed their satisfaction over growing
friendly relations between the two neighboring countries and
stressed the importance for continued mutual support in broad
fields.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that Chinese President Jiang Zemin's visit to Nepal
last year was of great importance to the consolidation of
bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-Nepalese friendship has a long history and there is no
any problem between the two neighbors, Qian said, but both sides
have been enjoying fruitful cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
Qian expressed the thanks to Nepal for its support to China on
the issues of Taiwan, Tibet and human rights.
</P>
<P>
He noted that it is necessary for the developing nations to
extend mutual sympathy and support in their common efforts to
safeguard stability and development.
</P>
<P>
Thapa extended to Qian his congratulations to the successful
convention of the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of
China which concluded last week.
</P>
<P>
Thapa said, Nepal is China's friendly neighbor and the Nepalese
people closely follows China's development and appreciate China's
progress.
</P>
<P>
The Nepalese foreign minister reiterated that the Nepalese
government will adhere to a "one China" policy, and will never let
any one to use the Nepalese soil to carry out activities aiming to
split China.
</P>
<P>
Nepal also will continue to stand by China on the human rights
issue, he stated.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers hold that the two countries will have
greater opportunities in expanding their economic cooperation with
the economic growth in their nations.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the two governments should encourage and support
their enterprises to actively join such cooperations, they
noted.

<HEADLINE> German Researcher Warns against Aid Vaccine Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 23 (Xinhua) -- A German researcher today warned
a Chicago doctors' group not to realize its plan to conduct AIDS
vaccine test on human bodies, saying that the experiment is
nothing more than a "suicide".
</P>
<P>
Under a plan of the Chicago-based group, 50 volunteers, 39 of
them are doctors themselves, would be injected with a live but
weakened strain of the AIDS virus HIV to prove that the strain
could serve as a vaccine that would train the human body's immune
system to resist full-strength HIV.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the German MDR radio today, Dr. Reinhard
Kurth, who head Germany's Robert Koch Institute, criticized the
volunteers as "a suicide squad" who are needlessly going to put
their lives at risk.
</P>
<P>
Kurth admitted that the vaccine test did have achieved some
effect on monkeys, but he also pointed to the fact that some young
monkeys had also developed AIDS during the tests.

<HEADLINE> U.S.-Japan Military Ties to Be Enhanced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 23 (Xinhua) -- With the new defense
cooperation guidelines going into effect, military relationship
between the United States and Japan will be enhanced, officials of
both countries reaffirmed.
</P>
<P>
The 16-page guidelines, revised on the basis of the 1978
version, was made public here today.
</P>
<P>
"It is really based upon mutual collaboration trying to device
the mechanisms whereby we can have greater coordination of
activities," said U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen at a joint
press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
The press conference followed a U.S.-Japan Security
Consultative Committee (SCC) meeting which adopted the guidelines.
</P>
<P>
Representing the U.S. at the meeting was also Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright while Japan was represented by Cohen's
counterpart Fumio Kyuma and Albright's counterpart Keizo Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines will "reinforce our security alliance which is
crucial to our common security and foundation of all our bilateral
ties," Albright told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"Our partnership with Japan is central to many of the issues
we'll be working on this week in New York, from nuclear
non-proliferation and United Nations reform to protecting
environment and promoting development in Africa," she said.
</P>
<P>
"U.S. policy in Asia Pacific has several pillars: cooperation
with Japan, engagement with China, eventual peace on the Korean
Peninsula and the presence of 100000 U.S. troops in the region,"
Cohen said at the press conference.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi said that "with the new guidelines, I trust Japan-U.S.
defense cooperation can proceed in a closer manner."
</P>
<P>
Kyuma also emphasized that the guidelines clarify cooperation
in the areas and roles that the two countries will play in the
post-war era.
</P>
<P>
Both countries have ensured that the new guidelines "are not
aimed at any third country".
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing country-specific or geographically specific"
in the guidelines, Albright said, declaring that "it does not
change our one-China policy".
</P>
<P>
According to a joint statement issued at the end of the SCC
meeting, both the U.S. and Japan "shared the view that it is
extremely important for the stability and prosperity of the
region that China play a positive and constructive role, and in
this context, stressed the continued interest of both countries in
furthering cooperation with China.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and Japanese officials expressed their intention to
"explain" the guidelines to China, South Korea and other countries
in the region to alleviate their concerns about the impact of
enhancement of U.S.-Japan military ties when approaching the 21st
century.

certainly slide back into conflict, potentially leading to a wider
war in Southeastern Europe," Berger said.

<P>
"It would undermine NATO's credibility at a critical moment
when the alliance is preparing for new members and new missions,"
he added.

<HEADLINE> Japan Supports U.N. Reform Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Japan today pledged to
take actions to support the reform of the United Nations and
voiced backing to the reform package put forward by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during the general debates of the 52nd session of the
U.N. General Assembly, Japanese Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi said
that the purpose of reforming the world body is to strengthen its
functions to further enable it to fully accomplish its tasks.
</P>
<P>
"We earnestly hope that the reform of the United Nations as a
whole will gather momentum" through Annan's proposals, Obuchi
said.
</P>
<P>
He warned that if the U.N. was unable to reform itself to meet
the demands of the coming age, but simply engages in an aimless
repetition of detailed arguments in which each member states
pursue its own interests, the confidence of the international
community in the organization would be severely undermined.
</P>
<P>
"We must be aware that at this moment we were standing at a
crucial crossroads. It is the very moment at which we must summon
the political will to decide on the outlines of U.N. reform," he
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi's speech indicated that Japan has joined a majority of
member states in expressing support to the reform efforts by Annan
who became the head of the U.N. administration on January 1 this
year.
</P>
<P>
He said that Japan believes reforms relating to the Security
Council, finance and development are the "three pillars" of the
U.N. reforms.
</P>
<P>
Referring to current financial crisis of the largest
international organization, Obuchi said that Japan wanted to
emphasize again that it is the obligation of member states to pay
their assessed contributions in full, and that member states in
arrears should make every effort to eliminate them.
</P>
<P>
Dues owed by member states to the United Nations have totaled
2.3 billion U.S. dollars. The United States alone reportedly owes
nearly 1.5 billion U.S. dollars.
