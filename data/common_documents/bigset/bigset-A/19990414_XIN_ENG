<HEADLINE> Referendum Constitutional: Ugandan President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni
has said the coming referendum is constitutional and will be held
as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks Tuesday afternoon at the closing ceremony
of the national executive meeting of the ruling National
Resistance Movement (NRM) in Jinja town, 80 kms east of the
capital city Kampala.
</P>
<P>
Museveni, who is the chairman of NRM, said the resolution to go
ahead with the referendum was reached bearing in mind the fact
that the ultimate decision about how the country should be
governed must be made by the people of Uganda in their entirety.
</P>
<P>
The meeting rejected a proposal that seeks to avoid the
referendum by going for an automatic extension of the Movement
system of governance up to the year 2006 and an automatic return
of multi-parties thereafter.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the press after the meeting, Museveni informed the
public that the laws concerning the referendum have already passed
cabinet level and will soon be tabled in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Under the constitution of the country, a referendum should be
held in 2000 to decide by the people on the political system they
prefer.

<HEADLINE> Uganda's Ruling Party Sets New Goals for Itself </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The four-day meeting of the
National Executive Committee of Uganda's ruling National
Resistance Movement (NRM) has concluded Tuesday afternoon with new
goals set for the coming years.
</P>
<P>
A 15-point program was passed at the meeting, stressing
environment protection, modernization of agriculture, poverty
eradication, creation of employment and training of the public
service.
</P>
<P>
A proposal for a new strategy in the financing of
infrastructure whereby the government will borrow substantial
funds from the public through issuance of government bonds. This
is aimed at enhancing national independence by not confining
government borrowing activities only to foreign borrowing.
</P>
<P>
The National Executive Committee also adopted a proposal that
the government open up infrastructure development to private
entrepreneurs guided by clear regulations to prevent exploitation
of the public by the private entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the NRM will embark on serious mobilization of the
public to inculcate a culture of saving and to discourage the
prevalent culture of extravagance.
</P>
<P>
The NRM came to power in 1986 and there was a 10-point program
guiding the ruling party before this new program was mapped out.

<HEADLINE> China on Guidelines on Conventional Arms Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 13 (Xinhua) -- In working out practical
guidelines on conventional arms control/limitation and disarmament
to consolidate peace, it was essential that such measures be in
line with local condition and be taken within an appropriate
time-frame, China stressed here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 1999 session of the United Nations Disarmament
Commission, Chinese Ambassador for Disarmament Affairs Li Changhe
said that given the different national conditions and complicated
causes of conflicts, it was very difficult to come up with a set
of guiding principles that was applicable to all countries or
regions.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Li said China hoped that the current session, within
its mandate, would focus on the consolidation of peace in
post-conflict regions while avoiding duplication of review on
peace keeping and humanitarian issues which had already been taken
by other UN mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
Li said China maintained that in building and consolidating
peace in conflict-inflicted regions, it was essential to follow
the purpose and principles of the United Nations Charter and the five
principles of peaceful co-existence, and it was essential to
take into account the relevant principles and proposals adopted
by the United Nations Disarmament Commission.
</P>
<P>
In formulating and implementing practical disarmament
measures, it was imperative that the legitimate self-defense
requirements of countries concerned be taken into full account
and in accordance with agreements freely arrived at among the
parties involved in conflicts, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Countries outside the regions but with influence in parties
to the conflicts should undertake special responsibility and
obligations in promoting arms control and disarmament and in
building and consolidating peace in the regions concerned, Li
added.

<HEADLINE> China on Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The establishment of
nuclear-weapon-free zone should be in line with the purposes and
principles of the United Nations Charter as well as the
internationally accepted norms of international law, China said
here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 1999 session of the United Nations Disarmament
Commission, Chinese Ambassador for Disarmament Affairs Li
Changhe said China had all along respected and supported the
efforts by non-nuclear-weapon states to establish
nuclear-weapon-free zones on the basis of arrangements freely
arrived at among themselves.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Li said China had undertaken unconditionally not
to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against
non-nuclear-weapons states or nuclear-weapon-free zones, and
China supported the efforts by the South East Asian countries to
establish nuclear-weapon-free zone in the region.
</P>
<P>
Li pointed out that the geographical scope of the
nuclear-weapon-free zones should not cover continental shelves and
exclusive economic zones, nor should it cover areas of dispute
between the states parties to the nuclear-weapon-free-zone
treaties and the neighboring states over the territorial
sovereignty and maritime rights and interests.
</P>
<P>
The existing security arrangements should not, in any way,
prejudice the status and character of nuclear-weapon-free zone,
and the states parties to the treaty should not exempt themselves
from their treaty obligations under whatever pretexts, including
those based on their membership in a military alliance, Li added.

<HEADLINE> China on Fourth Special Session of GA on Disarmament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 13 (Xinhua) -- It was appropriate to
convene the fourth special session of the Uninted Nations General
Assembly on disarmament when the mankind was about to enter a new
millennium, China said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 1999 session of the United Nations Disarmament
Commission, Chinese Ambassador for Disarmament Affairs Li Changhe
said the three previous special sessions on disarmament had played
a positive role in guiding and promoting international disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Li said while it was true that certain remarkable
progress had been achieved since the end of the cold war between
the east and west, it had, nevertheless, unfortunately been
coupled with some practices which were not conducive to achieving
the objective and fundamental purpose of international
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Li was responding to the development, deployment and
proliferation of anti-missile systems and the attempt to amend and
even pull out from the agreed arms control treaties which had
helped maintain global strategic balance.
</P>
<P>
Such new developments have turned the outer space into a
battle field, and this would inevitably produce a far-reaching
negative impact on international security and stability and
trigger off a new found of arms race, thus severely hampering or
neutralizing the efforts committed to international nuclear
disarmament and non-proliferation, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The fourth special session of the General Assembly on
disarmament could be a chance to review all relevant issues,
including the above mentioned developments so as to work out the
objectives and orientation for the international arms control and
disarmament in the next century.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Write off Part of African Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton has
promised that his government will make efforts in writing off part
of African countries' debt to the United States.
</P>
<P>
"English-Speaking Youths' Friends Club", a Luanda-based youth
club, made the announcement Tuesday at a press conference here,
saying that Clinton made the promise in a letter to the club.
</P>
<P>
It is said that Clinton has applied to the congress to write
off about 237 million U.S. dollars of African debt, adding that
the figure will reach 245 million if the debt due this year is
included.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also apologized for not visiting Angola during his
African tour, saying that his visit schedule was too full to cover
such a big continent.
</P>
<P>
Members of the club said that their club had sent a letter to
Clinton, demanding Clinton write off Africa's debt to the U.S. as
a compensation for its four-century long slave trade.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made an apology to African people for the "dirty trade"
during his African tour last year, but the Angolan youth club said
in their letter to Clinton, that "an apology of words without any
action makes no sense."
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Angola has a total foreign debt of 12
billion U.S. dollars, with over five billion to the Soviet Union,
1.7 billion to Portugal and one billion to the U.S.

<HEADLINE> NATO Chief Explains Train Damage Case in Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 13 (Xinhua) -- NATO's Supreme Commander in
Europe, Wesley Clark, said here Tuesday a NATO pilot unintendedly
hit a passenger train on Monday when he was carrying out a mission
of strike against "military targets" in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The NATO military chief told reporters that "We don't want to
hurt innocent people, innocent civilians in this campaign, so we
are working very hard to prevent collateral damage."
</P>
<P>
"One of the things we are doing is we are using precision
weaponry. This campaign has the highest proportion of precision
weaponry which have ever been used in any air operation anywhere,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Clark said that in Monday's case, the pilot was "assigned to
strike a railroad bridge that is a part of the integrated
communications supply network in Serbia."
</P>
<P>
"He launched his missiles from his aircraft that was many miles
away, he was not able to put his eyes on the bridge. It was a
remotely directed attack," he told a news briefing at NATO
headquarters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Clark also said the mission was to take out the bridge, and the
pilot realized when the incident happened that he did not hit the
bridge, what he hit was the train.
</P>
<P>
At least 10 people were killed reportedly when the missiles hit
the No. 393 train from Belgrade to Skopje at about 11:45 Monday
morning.

<P>
The French emissary said that it is compulsory that stability
be promoted in south-eastern Europe, that this Balkan region be

our Romanian friends, as well as by other states concerned" about
a region "long struck by history".

<HEADLINE> NATO Military Chief Sums Up Air Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 13 (Xinhua) -- NATO's Supreme Commander in
Europe, Wesley Clark, said here Tuesday that the alliance during
its three-week air strikes against Yugoslavia canceled 50 percent
sorties in ten days due to weather impact.
</P>
<P>
Despite unfavorable weather conditions, Clark told reporters
that the NATO sent a total of 5,924 sorties, of which 1,687 are
strike sorties, in the three-week period.
</P>
<P>
During the last 24 hours, 165 strike sorties from a total of
446 sorties had flown, Clark told a news briefing at the NATO
headquarters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Now the number of NATO aircraft for this campaign increased to
550 from 400 in March 24, when the western allies started air
strikes against Yugoslavia, according to the U.S general.
</P>
<P>
Clark said what the NATO "precisely intend to do" is "attack,
disrupt, degrade, deter further Serb actions, and keep it going
and further degrade Serb military potential."
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, we are going after in a way more strategic
target sites, that have to do with forces that are possible to be
used to reinforce basis of supplying the integrated air defense
systems, which protect the entire array of targets around the
country, and also higher level of command and control, petroleum
and many other factors of this military and security juggernaut,"
the NATO military chief added.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Says Airstrikes Diminishing Yugoslav Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Tuesday that the NATO airstrikes are "diminishing and
grinding down" Yugoslav military capabilities.
</P>
<P>
Clinton offered his assessment after a two-hour meeting at the
White House with House and Senate members, many of whom urged him
either to use ground troops or to preposition them in Europe for
possible use. He ignored a question about ground troops.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the Rose Garden, Clinton said, "Our campaign is
diminishing and grinding down Mr. Milosevic's military
capabilities. We have weakened Serbia's air defenses and
command-and-control. We have reduced his ability to move, sustain
and supply the war machine in Kosovo. We have damaged his
refineries and diminished his capacity to produce ammunition. We
are striking now at his tanks and at his artillery and have
destroyed half of his advanced MiG-29 aircraft."
</P>
<P>
"Now we are taking our allied campaign to the next level, with
more aircraft in the region, with a British carrier joining our
USS Roosevelt and a French carrier in the area," the president
added.
</P>
<P>
He said he would ask Congress soon for an emergency
supplemental appropriation to pay for the war costs.
Administration and congressional officials have estimated the
costs at 2.5 billion to 3 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
NATO's military commander, Army Gen. Wesley Clark, said Tuesday
he had requested about 300 more U.S. aircraft as well as more air
power from NATO allies, although he did not say how many. Defense
Secretary William Cohen was expected to give quick approval, said
defense officials, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Early, senior officials said that the Pentagon plans to send
another 300 warplanes into the fight against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The reinforcements would be in addition to the 500 U.S.
aircraft already part of the 700-plane NATO force.
</P>
<P>
If hundreds more American planes are sent to Europe for the
Yugoslavia mission, it is highly likely that Cohen would ask
Clinton to give him authority to call up members of the National
Guard and Reserve.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the Clinton administration was pressing its
insistence that the conflict in the Balkans could be resolved by
air power alone, despite a movement in Congress to arm Clinton
with the ground troop option.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Sets Aside Over $3M for Road Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
has set aside a total of 59.3 billion shillings (about 3.59
million U.S. dollars) for the rehabilitation and construction of
more than 600-kilometer-long roads in central and northern parts
of the country.
</P>
<P>
John Magufuli, deputy minister of Works, said this at the
National Assembly Tuesday in the central town of Dodoma when
answering questions raised by members of parliament.
</P>
<P>
The road projects in Dodoma and three other regions will be
financed by the World Bank, European Union (EU) and the African
Development Bank, Magufuli said.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has allocated 50 million U.S. dollars for the
construction of the 110-kilometer Singida-Shelui road, he said,
adding that the survey contract and preparation of tender
documents are expected to be signed this month.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the standard tarmac road will commence during
the next fiscal year starting July 1, Magufuli said.
</P>
<P>
The government, he said, has set aside 30 million U.S. dollars,
a loan from Africa Development Bank, for tarmacking the
108-kilometer Shelui-Nzega road. The survey work has been carried
out.
</P>
<P>
As for the emergency repair of the 135-km Dodoma-Manyoni road,
the government has set aside 1.47 billion shillings, using a World
Bank loan.
</P>
<P>
Floods resulted from El Nino rains last year have damaged nine
trunk road corridors in Tanzania. The government said more than
110 million U.S. dollars are needed to restore the damaged
infrastructure facilities and services.

<HEADLINE> UK Aids Infection Reaches Record High in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 13 (Xinhua) -- New HIV infections in the UK
reached their highest annual toll in 1998 with nearly 2,900 people
diagnosed with the disease, according to a poll released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Terrence Higgins Trust charity, which published the
statistics, said the incidence of new infections was alarming and
showed a need to continue general education about HIV and to
target certain groups.
</P>
<P>
Since 1982, at least 40,000 people have been infected with HIV
in the UK and around 13,000 have died from Aids.
</P>
<P>
However, as drug treatments continue to slow the onset of
full-blown Aids, the number of people in the UK infected with the
HIV virus was expected to increase by 50 percent to some 27,000 by
the year 2003, the charity warned.
</P>
<P>
Another poll published on Tuesday by the charity on attitudes
towards sex also showed that many people in the UK remained
ignorant of the hazards of HIV infection posed by unprotected sex.
</P>
<P>
The survey of over 2,000 adults in England aged 15 and over
showed that around one in 14 is having unsafe sex when they start
a new relationship.
</P>
<P>
The survey suggested that education needs to be targeted more
at younger age groups, who may have missed out on publicity drives
in the 1980s.

BONN, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The parliamentary fraction leader of
German left-wing opposition Democratic Socialism Party (PDS),
Gregor Gysi, had left for Belgrade with Kosovo peace proposals,
his office said Tuesday in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
Gysi's peace bill to be presented in Belgrade included both
NATO and the Yugoslav side immediately stopping use of force, and
the United Nations initiating direct negotiations.
</P>

Gysi planned to meet Yugoslav Prime Minister Mimor Bulatovic

remained to be seen whether he would meet President Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
The trip makes Gysi the first German lawmaker to visit Belgrade
since NATO launched air campaign against Yugoslavia last month.
</P>
<P>
A similar visit was cancelled in March when Milosevic indicated
he did not want to meet Gysi.
</P>
<P>
Gysi's PDS, formerly the communist party in East Germany, is
the only political party in the German parliament that hit
Germany's participation in NATO strikes.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Opposition to Hold Constitutional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The National Constitutional
Assembly (NCA) of Zimbabwe Tuesday decided at an extraordinary
meeting to convene a people' s constitutional conference next
month to find ways of breaking deadlock with the government over
the drafting of the new constitution.
</P>
<P>
NCA chairman Morgan Tsvangirai said as a result of the impasse,
the NCA, a group of churches, civic groups and trade unions, had
resolved to educate the people on the constitution even without
the participation of the government, the Zimbabwe News Agency
Ziana reported.
</P>
<P>
He said NCA members who had been approached by the government
to participate in the proposed commission of enquiry into
constitutional reforms to be appointed by President Robert Mugabe
should recuse themselves.
</P>
<P>
"The government is adamant over the issue and the NCA is not
going to participate in a constitution which only involves the
ruling ZANU-PF (Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front)
party," he said.
</P>
<P>
NCA spokesperson Welshman Ncube said the assembly had also
decided to stand aside while the government drafted its
constitution which, however, would not represent the interests of
Zimbabweans.
</P>
<P>
Minister Without Portfolio Eddison Zvobgo, who is also
ZANU-PF's secretary for legal affairs, has announced that Mugabe
would soon appoint a commission of inquiry into the drafting of a
new constitution.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the government would take the issue on its
own if other parties concerned were not willing to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is making strides to draft a new constitution to
replace the British-authored Lancaster House document signed in
1979 which many people felt did not represent the interests of
Zimbabweans.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Army Recovers Major Positions Near Central </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- A source from the Angolan army
announced here Tuesday that in the past 48 hours the government
forces have recovered two important positions near Kuito, capital
city of Bie Province in central Angola, thus expanding the defense
lines for the highland city.
</P>
<P>
The source from the Defense Ministry said after "fierce
fighting", the army recovered Cunhinga City, 34 km to the north of
Kuito, and Chipeta Village, 25 km east of Kuito.
</P>
<P>
The two places had been captured twice by the rebel National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) forces since
the civil war renewed in mid-November of last year, with the
latest taking place in March.
</P>
<P>
The recovery of the two "strategic" areas has great
significance for safeguarding Kuito city, according to the
military source. Chipeta Village which is near the Kuito airport
could be re-opened for airlifting food and military goods once the
UNITA forces are purged. Cunhinga City, on the other hand, hosted
UNITA's long-range cannon base, which had attacked Kuito City and
its environs.
</P>
<P>
During the fighting, said the source, a large number of UNITA
soldiers were killed. Meanwhile, weapons and ammunitions were
obtained including a T-55 tank, a D-33 gun and a ground-to-air
missile.
</P>
<P>
However, the source did not reveal the loss on the side of the
government army.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian government
spokeswoman Selome Taddesse Tuesday denied recent reports that
heavily-armed Ethiopian defense forces have entered Somalia,
saying they are "unfounded".
</P>
<P>
In fact, said the statement issued here by the spokeswoman, in
recent years Ethiopia has been facilitating peace efforts between
the factions in Somalia by providing a peace forum through which
the factions could try to resolve their differences.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia has at all times maintained that it is up to the
Somali factions themselves to find a way forward, said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia's foreign policy is based on non-interference in the
internal affairs of neighboring states and this fundamental
principle has been adhered to in Ethiopia's relations with
Somalia, it noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the spokeswoman announced here that Ethiopian
authorities detained at the weekend Somali nationals who attempted
to smuggle explosives into Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
The authorities are in possession of the explosives which come
from different countries of origin, she said, adding "further
details will be made available."

<HEADLINE> Association Set Up to Retrieve Ethiopian Treasures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- An association which aims at
retrieving Ethiopian treasures looted by British expeditionary
forces from Magdala, northern Ethiopia, in 1868 was formally
established here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Professor Andreas Eshete, chairman of the Association for the
Return of the Magdala Ethiopian Treasures, said the association
seeks to restore treasures forcibly taken from Ethiopia to Britain
to the rightful owner.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian News Agency, a British-Ethiopian,
Edward Ullendorff, has written that 400 manuscripts were taken
from the library of the church of Medhane Alem when the British
expeditionary forces invaded Magdala.
</P>
<P>
"Apart from this official collection no fewer than 150-200
manuscripts were brought to Britain by individual members of the
expeditionary forces," Ullendorff was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The loot from Magdala included an infinite variety of gold,
silver and brass crosses as well as heaps of royally illuminated
parchments, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"Our first task will be to sensitize Ethiopians and the British
public alike on what had happened on Magdala 131 years ago,"
Andreas said, adding "the association will then make headway to
the cultural committee in the House of People's Representatives so
that a formal request be made to the British government to hand
back the looted treasures."

<TEXT>
<P>
At 9:30 a.m. EST, Zhu opened the market places, which operate
through Nasdaq system across the United States.
</P>
<P>
Voicing his warm welcome to the visit by Premier Zhu, Frank Zarb,
chairman and chief executive officer of the National Association of
Securities Dealers (NASD), said that this visit came at an important
time when China and the United States are seeking strengthened economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Alfred Berkeley, president of the Nasdaq Stock Market, told the
visiting premier, "We believe there are many things that the Nasdaq and
the Amex can do together with you to promote capital formation and
job creation. We hope this meeting is the beginning of a process and
continuing relationship."
</P>
<P>
John Wall, Nasdaq international president, briefed the Chinese
leader on the operation of the electronic stock market, saying that
the Nasdaq Market Site is "the public's window on the Nasdaq Market,
it provides investors with second to second financial information
wherever and whenever it occurs."
</P>
<P>
Nasdaq was the first major stock market in the world to be
totally screen-based. Unlike the traditional stock market, it has no
centralized trading floor, but rather more than 500 separate trading
floors linked together. "This is Nasdaq's power, the accumulation of
capital," Wall said.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq Stock Market is home to more than 5,000 companies of
which about 10 percent are non-U.S. based. Nasdaq companies are
among some of the fastest growing and are frequently leaders in
their field.
</P>
<P>
The host and the guest exchanged gifts. Presenting a sculpture of
a strong bull to the Nasdaq president, Zhu said he hopes the Nasdaq is
"always bull market."
</P>
<P>
Just before the end of his visit, Zhu wrote on the visitors'
book, saying the Nasdaq is "the link between science and
technology and finance, (and) the cradle for fortune and success."
</P>

Zhu arrived in New York on Monday night to continue his official
visit to the United States. He will fly to Boston, the last leg of

<HEADLINE> WHO, EU to Jointly Sponsor Meeting on Mental </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) and the European Union (EU) are jointly organizing a meeting
on mental health in Europe next week in Brussels, Belgium,
announced WHO here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first-ever joint collaboration between WHO and
the EU in the field of mental health, WHO said.
</P>
<P>
Mental problems are among the most important contributors to
the global burden of disease and disability, according to WHO.
Five of the 10 leading causes of disability worldwide are mental
health problems.
</P>
<P>
However, WHO said, in contrast to the dramatic improvements in
physical health this century, the mental component of health has
not improved.
</P>
<P>
To address this, participants from 38 European countries and
several international organizations will look to establish a
consensus on how to improve the promotion of mental health in
Europe during the meeting on April 22-24.
</P>
<P>
WHO expects the meeting to come out with an agenda defining
priorities for the promotion of mental health which WHO and the EU
can incorporate into their respective work programs and which can
serve as a basis for joint action between the organizations.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Govt Army Ready for Counter-attack: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for the Headquarters
of the General Staff of Angolan armed forces has said the
government army is still in firm control of the situation in the
country and is ready for large scale counter-offensives on UNITA
forces.
</P>
<P>
Jose Manuel "Jota", the spokesman, made the remarks in Benguela
City in the central region, the Angola News Agency reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Jota admitted that since the rebel National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) overpowered the government
army in weapons and other facilities, the current situation in
Malanke Province in the north and Huambo and Bie provinces in the
central part is "very tense" with "extremely fierce fightings"
going on.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted the UNITA forces have lost the strategic
intentions to occupy the capitals of these provinces, and have
been weakened gradually.
</P>
<P>
In other regions of the country, Jota said the government army
has " contained the movements of (Jonas) Savimbi's guerrilla
forces." Even in areas where fightings are still on, life in
Huambo and Kuito, capitals of Huambo and Bie provinces, has been
practically restored, except that Malanje City is still constantly
under the UNITA gunfires.
</P>
<P>
This has made it possible for the government army to shift from
 defensive to offensive, said the spokesman, who added that the
army's strategy is to besiege the Savimbi forces in some major
fighting areas before launching powerful military counter-attacks
and finally "completely destroy his war machines."
</P>
<P>
Analysts here indicated that to avert its disadvantage at the
war front, the government army, in addition to continuing its
tenacious defensives, is purchasing advanced weapons in large
numbers from the international market to get prepared for a
decisive battle in May when the rainy season ends.
</P>
<P>
Since the civil war renewed in mid-November of last year, the
Angolan government army had once turned to offensive. However,
with setbacks in fightings for UNITA headquarter in central Andulo
in March, the table turned once again in favor of UNITA.
</P>
<P>
Military sources revealed that the UNITA movement has been
newly equipped with T-62, T-55 tanks, and various types of middle-
and long-range cannons. It has also used Russian-made
ground-to-air missiles to contain the air advantage of the
government army, which shows that UNITA is ready for large- scale
regular warfares.
</P>
<P>
The renewal of the civil war in Angola has brought great losses
to its people. The military spokesman admitted that at present
about 1,000 people die every day. The number of refugees have
increased by 800,000, to the current 1.5 million. People living
in the besieged Huambo and Kuito cities are now on the verge of
hunger.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Sells 20 Tons of Ivory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 13 (Xinhua) -- A substantial amount of money was
raised from all the 20 tons of Zimbabwean ivory sold by auction to
Japanese buyers here Tuesday, according to Willas Makombe,
director of the Zimbabwean National Parks and Wildlife Management.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference that the auction went well in
accordance with discussions held with Japanese buyers Monday.
</P>
<P>
"All lots were purchased and we are happy with the conduct of
the auction from the Zimbabwean view point and from the
auctioneer's view point.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is now beginning preparations for the ivory to be
shipped to Japan," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the director would not release the prices, which were
denominated in U.S. dollars, as Botswana had not auctioned its
ivory. Prices would be released within the next six months.
</P>
<P>
Makombe noted that the auction opened the concept that existed
in Zimbabwe of the utilization of natural resources for
sustainable development of the people.
</P>
<P>
"A significant amount of funds has been provided through the
auction to the conservation programs in Zimbabwe not just for the
conservation of the African elephant, but to the whole
infrastructure of conservation efforts in Zimbabwe," said Jim
Armstrong, deputy secretary-general of the Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES).
</P>
<P>
Tamotsu Ishibashi of the Japanese Ivory Association also

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Sells 20 Tons of Ivory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 13 (Xinhua) -- A substantial amount of money was
raised from all the 20 tons of Zimbabwean ivory sold by auction to
Japanese buyers here Tuesday, according to Willas Makombe,
director of the Zimbabwean National Parks and Wildlife Management.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference that the auction went well in
accordance with discussions held with Japanese buyers Monday.
</P>
<P>
"All lots were purchased and we are happy with the conduct of
the auction from the Zimbabwean view point and from the
auctioneer's view point.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is now beginning preparations for the ivory to be
shipped to Japan," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the director would not release the prices, which were
denominated in U.S. dollars, as Botswana had not auctioned its
ivory. Prices would be released within the next six months.
</P>
<P>
Makombe noted that the auction opened the concept that existed
in Zimbabwe of the utilization of natural resources for
sustainable development of the people.
</P>
<P>
"A significant amount of funds has been provided through the
auction to the conservation programs in Zimbabwe not just for the
conservation of the African elephant, but to the whole
infrastructure of conservation efforts in Zimbabwe," said Jim
Armstrong, deputy secretary-general of the Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES).
</P>
<P>
Tamotsu Ishibashi of the Japanese Ivory Association also
expressed satisfaction with the auction and said the tusks would
be inspected by the CITES Secretariat and the government of Japan
which would then register it so as to track down its use and
proper handling.
</P>
<P>
He said Japan would adhere to the conditions stipulated by the
CITES that it would not re-export the ivory from the three

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Politicians Urged to Save Peace through </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland Secretary Mo
Mowlam on Tuesday urged politicians in the province to make
compromise to save the peace deal which was hit hard by the row
over decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
"If they fight just their own corner, then progress cannot be
made. It is important that they understand and realize that they
have to look broader than that," Mowlam told reporters in the
provincial capital Belfast just before the discussions resumed.
</P>
<P>
Mowlam said that without some compromise there would not be a
breakthrough which would enable the executive -- the proposed
cabinet for the Northern Ireland Assembly -- to be formed.
</P>
<P>
But as soon as the discussions began, Sinn Fein Chairman
Mitchel McLaughlin formally rejected the declaration by British
Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Irish counterpart Bertie Ahern,
dealing a new blow to the Northern Ireland peace process.
</P>
<P>
The sticking point in the Northern Ireland peace process
continues to be the battle between Sinn Fein and the Ulster
Unionists over when decommissioning should begin.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland's First Minister and Ulster Unionist leader
David Trimble insist the Irish Republican Army, or IRA, must hand
over weapons before Sinn Fein can take up two ministerial posts in
the 12-seat executive.
</P>
<P>
But Sinn Fein points out no such obligation exists in the Good
Friday Agreement and accuses Trimble of erecting new barriers.
</P>
<P>
Blair and Ahern have made it clear they are ready to join the
latest round of talks later in the week if significant progress is
made at the talks.

<HEADLINE> WHO Presses for Coordinated Fight Against AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Embraim Samba, World Health
Organization (WHO) regional director for Africa, said here Tuesday
there is a need for coordinated efforts in the fight against
HIV/AIDS at regional level to curb its spread.
</P>
<P>
"What is now needed in the fight against AIDS is coordinated
efforts by member countries to achieve much progress," he told the
Zimbabwe News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He urged countries to disclose more information on AIDS to
their populations, saying there was no need of denying the
existence of the disease since it had affected many people in the
region.
</P>
<P>
"WHO will assist countries with the technical knowledge in
tackling the AIDS epidemics," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the AIDS menace was more prevalent
in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region partly
because of cross border travelling which resulted in the spreading
of the disease.
</P>
<P>
Of the 30.6 million adults and children living with AIDS in the
world, 20.8 million were in Africa and every day 7,500 new HIV
infections occurred in the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
WHO had greatly improved in the eradicating of polio in the
region because of immunization programs which were carried out in
affected countries like Angola and the Democratic Republic of
Congo, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a WHO African regional meeting aimed at discussing
important issues related to health on the continent entered into
its second day Tuesday in Harare.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was being attended by experts from 46 African
countries.

<HEADLINE> Greece Denies Press Reports Over Macedonia's Name Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Greece denied Tuesday that it
would sign with Macedonia an agreement later April to resolve the
thorny name issue of Greece's northern neighbor.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas said that there was no agreement about to be
signed.
</P>
<P>
He added that Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov had requested
a meeting with Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis on April 25,
but the name issue had not been cited as the reason for the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Describing as positive that Macedonia considered Greece to be a
"strategic partner" in the Balkan region, the spokesman noted that
the name dispute had not stopped the two countries from forging
good bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Local press had recently speculated that the two neighbors
appeared to settle their dispute over the name issue of Macedonia
by signing the necessary agreement in New York on April 25 when
Gligorov and Simitis meet there.
</P>
<P>
Greece would reportedly recognize Macedonia under the name of
Republic of Macedonia-Skopje.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, Macedonia declared its independence from Yugoslavia,
but Greece has expressed its opposition to the use of the name
"Macedonia" by Skopje, saying that it implied territorial
ambitions over its own northern region of Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, Greece imposed a trade embargo over Macedonia and
claimed that relations between the two countries could not be
normalized until the name issue was resolved.
</P>
<P>
Trade ties between Greece and Macedonia have in recent years
been improved remarkably, with Athens now becoming the largest
direct investor in Macedonia.

<HEADLINE> Clinton and Congress Try to Work Out Costs in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Congress and the White
House Tuesday began working out details of an emergency funding
package to pay the cost of the U.S. bombing campaign in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
U.S. House of Representatives Republican Leader Dick Armey, who
and other congressional leaders met with Clinton on Monday, said
Clinton has asked the Republican leadership to fund the package on
an "emergency" basis, which would not require cutbacks, or
offsets, in government spending to cover the military costs.
</P>
<P>
Armey said the leadership has yet to settle that critical
issue. If Republicans demanded cutbacks, the Kosovo funding
package could stall while lawmakers sparred over what government
spending programs to cut.
</P>
<P>
House and Senate aides involved in the appropriations process
said the White House request could total as much as 3 billion U.S.
dollars. That would cover the military cost of the air campaign to
date, estimated at 500 million U.S. dollars by private analysts,
and some future costs related to the mission.

JOHANNESBURG, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Health Minister of Swaziland
Phetsile Dlamini has appealed to launch new strategies to
enlighten men on the importance of family planning.
</P>
<P>
Southern African Broadcasting Association Tuesday quoted
Dlamini as saying that women in Swaziland had generally accepted
teachings of birth control, but men were still left behind.
</P>
<P>
She said that it was useless when the subject was understood by

Dlamini said the Swazi government was committed to supporting
family- planning activities, especially fighting AIDS and its
virus, HIV.

<HEADLINE> PNC to Meet on Statehood Declaration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National Council
(PNC) is scheduled to convene a special meeting on April 27 in Gaza
city to decide on the issue of declaring an independent Palestinian
state, PNC Speaker Salim Za'anoun told the Voice of Palestine Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The planned meeting will have the say on the statehood issue.
</P>
<P>
Before the meeting, the Executive Committee of the Palestinian
Liberation Organization (PLO) and the Palestinian Legislative Council,
will also hold meetings to discuss the issue, Za'anoun said.
</P>
<P>
The PNC will review the outcomes of Palestinian consultations with
leaders of various countries in the world, discuss a report prepared
by the PLO Executive Committee and then make a final decision on the
date of declaring an independent Palestinian state, he added.
</P>
<P>
The invitations to all PNC members, including those living abroad,
will be distributed on Saturday, he said.
</P>
<P>
The declaration of an independent Palestinian state is the number
one issue for the Palestinians, he said, adding that it is almost an
unanimous position among PNC members and other Palestinian factions
that an independent Palestinian state must be declared at the end of
the five-year transitional period under the Oslo Accords signed in
1994.
</P>
<P>
For this purpose, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has travelled to
many European, Asian and African countries to seek their advise and
support during the last two months.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has repeated on many ocassions in the past that he will
declare an independent Palestinian state on May 4 this year, when the
five-year transitional period of the Oslo expires.
</P>
<P>
However, Israel has opposed the idea, threatening to annex parts of
the West Bank now under its control.
</P>
<P>
Countries in Asia and Africa that Arafat visited have already
expressed their support to this cause of the Palestinian people. And
the European Union also adopted a resolution in March, saying that the
Palestinian people do have the right of self-determination for this
purpose.
</P>
<P>
But the United States, the major player of the Mideast process, has
been siding with Israel. It advised Arafat to delay the statehood
declaration and pledged only to help speed up the peace process in the
Mideast.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is to leave Gaza for China on Wednesday and to discuss this
issue with the Chinese state and government leaders.

<HEADLINE> Study: New Internet Users in U.S. to Be Older, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 13 (Xinhua) -- As indications of a maturing
technology, the characteristics of first-time Internet users in
the United States will begin to shift during 1999, according to
report released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Based on a survey of 16,500 U.S. households in December last
year, the report said that the number of households with Internet
access grew exceptionally fast between April and December of 1998,
reaching 37 percent of all U.S. households.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted by INTECO Corporation, a U.S. market
intelligence firm that forecasts consumer-level actions and
attitudes relative to PCs, the Internet, online services,
interactive TV and other similar technologies.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-five percent of Internet households report annual income
of 50,000 U.S. dollars or more. While upscale households continue
to dominate the Internet, INTECO said, this segment is reaching
saturation, and first-time users will soon be taking on a new
look.
</P>
<P>
The research shows that middle and lower-income households
account for 55 percent of those who intend to become Internet
users in the next 12 months. Other segments showing an upswing
include households headed by non-professionals or non-executives
and households headed by a retiree.
</P>
<P>
Growth among female users will outpace that of males. Single
female households comprise 30 percent of all households that
expect to adopt Internet usage this year.
</P>
<P>
"Internet growth is far from over," the market analysis firm
said. "There are still huge advances expected, in terms of numbers
of users as well as numbers and types of services being offered to
Internet users."
</P>
<P>
But as Internet penetration among higher-income households is
approaching saturation, the "new user" segment will become an
increasingly diverse market, the firm said.
</P>
<P>
The study also found that Internet users are increasingly
convinced of the value it delivers. Ninety-five percent of the
Internet-using households surveyed at the end of 1998 indicated
that they intended to remain Internet subscribers for the next
year.

<HEADLINE> IMF Says Indonesian Economy to Restore Growth Late </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Economy is
expected to restore positive real growth from late this year with
firm implementation of the structural reform program and the
continued strong financial support of the international community,
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Overall, (executive) directors were satisfied that policies
and developments continued to evolve as best as possible in a
manner consistent with setting the stage for economic recovery,
against a background of difficult and unsettled domestic
conditions," the IMF said in an annual report on the Indonesian
economy.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian economy was down 16 percent during 1998/99
fiscal year, which ended on March 30 this year, from the previous
year's level, due to the country's financial crisis and political
disturbances.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate was about 66 percent in 1998/99, up from 5.2
percent in 1996/1997 and 12.9 percent in 1997/98. Real wages fell
sharply and surveys indicated that the share of the population
below the poverty line rose.
</P>
<P>
"The authorities' macroeconomic framework for 1999/2000
envisages that the economy should soon bottom out, that real gross
domestic product (GDP) for the year would be broadly unchanged,
and external position should strengthen, with foreign reserves
expected to increase to around 29 billion U.S. dollars (five
months of imports of goods and services)," the IMF said.
</P>
<P>
It said that prudent monetary policy should lay the basis for
average inflation of some 15-20 percent for the fiscal year of
1999/2000.
</P>
<P>
The budget deficit is projected at nearly 6 percent of GDP to
help promote recovery, with increased provisions for targeted
social safety net outlays, it added.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the IMF cautioned that the country's
macroeconomic situation would remain difficult until the political
transition was further advanced.
</P>
<P>
"Directors also stated that policy continuity after the
elections and a clear political will for reform will be crucial to
unleash new confidence in the adjustment program and to strengthen
the country's medium-term growth prospects and its external
position," the IMF said.

<P>
LONDON, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Europe's main stock markets echoed
rise on Wall Street to close high Tuesday with London ending at a
new record.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE-100 Index rocketed ahead to close at an all-time high
of 6,513.1, gaining 71.9 points on the day. The closing record was
complemented by a mid-trading peak of 6,519.5, also setting a
record for the index.
</P>
<P>
Optimism in the City was sparked by a further improvement on
the Dow Jones Industrial Average as it opened firmly ahead in the
afternoon, consolidating the previous session's record gains.
</P>
<P>
Even the news that Barclays' new chief executive, Michael
O'Neill, was quitting because of ill health failed to dampen the
banking group as it rapidly overcame early losses to post a 46p
rise on the day to 19.18.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Xetra Dax index rose more than 1 percent on the day
as a buy recommendation on DaimlerChrysler buoyed the market.
</P>
<P>
The electronically traded Xetra Dax closed up 1.12 percent, or
57.7 points, at 5,225, while in floor trade the Dax closed up 0.78
percent at 5,199.
</P>
<P>
While French blue chip shares did not rise as much as their
counterparts in London and Frankfurt, Paris's CAC-40 index still
registered its second consecutive closing record for 1999.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Govt Accuses Opposition of Creating Chaos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government Tuesday
accused the Opposition United National Independence Party (UNIP)
led by former President Kenneth Kaunda of mounting a calculated
deformation campaign to create chaos in the country.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Newstead Zimba accused the UNIP of
adopting world-wide campaign against the ruling Movement for
Multi-Party Democracy (MMD).
</P>
<P>
Zimba, who is also the country's information minister, told the
Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation that the UNIP wants to
portray its leader Kaunda as a victim of the government.
</P>
<P>
Zimba denied any involvement by the government in alleged
assassination attempt on Kaunda's life.
</P>
<P>
He made the denial in reaction to UNIP leaders' accusations
that the government attempts to persecute and assassinate Kaunda,
who rule the country for 27 years after the country's independence
in 1964.
</P>
<P>
On the declaration made by the Ndola High Court last month that
Kaunda is stateless, Zimba reaffirmed that the declaration was
made independently from the government.
</P>
<P>
He said the judgement is based on evidence submitted.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda, who was born of Malawi parents, were barred from
running for presidency in the elections held in 1996, when a
constitutional amendment was adopted under which foreign nationals
and those with foreign parentage are prohibited from contesting.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda has vowed to contest the post in the next poll in 2001.

<HEADLINE> Arafat: Statehood Declaration is Palestinian People's Sovereign Right </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
GAZA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- "To declare an independent
Palestinian state is the sacred sovereign right of the Palestinian
people," declared Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"But, consider the stalemate the Mideast peace process faces and
the general elections will be held in Israel and other actors,we
have been consulting this matter with friendly countries in the
world including China," Arafat added.
</P>
<P>
Arafat made those remarks during an interview with the Chinese
reporters based in Israel on the eve of his working visit to China
starting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said his main prupose for visiting China is to consult with
the Chinese leaders over the issue of declaring an independent
Palestinian state andto seek their advise.
</P>
<P>
Countries in Europe, Asia and Africa and Arab nations that he
has visited recently have all unanimously expressed their support to
the right of the self-determination of the Palestinian people and
their right of establishing and independent Palestinian state free
of any pro-conditions.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the declaration adopted in March by heads of
government of the EU in Berlin. Arafat stressed that the EU
declaration reflected the basic changes among the EU nations,
because those countries and the declaration have expressed strong
support to the right of theself-determination ofthe Palestinian
people and their right to establish anindependent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
As asked to comment about thereports that the United States has
asked the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to delay its
statehood declaration while promissing only to help speed up the
peace process, Arafat said that consultation with the U.S. is still
going on this issue, hoping the U.S. could change its attitude.
</P>
<P>
Turing to the Sino-Palestinian relations, Arafat said that China
is of the countries that supports the Palestinian people's cause
since long and expressed his hope that the two sides will strengthen
further the friendly cooperations in the future.
</P>
<P>
On the current development of the Mideast peace process, Arafat
said the peace process has faced the stalemate again due to Israeli
government's refusal to further implement the principle of "land for peace."
</P>
<P>
He strongly urged the Israeli side to implement the Wye
agreement signed between the two sides last October in Washington to
move the precess forward.
</P>
<P>
The basis for moving the peace process forward is to implement
the principle of "land for peace" that has been stipulated in the
resolution 242 and resolution 338 adopted by the United Nations, and
this region could not have peace if the Israeli governmentstill
refuses to implement this principle and withdraw its troops from the
Arab lands which Israel occupied in the 1967 war, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Rejecting Israel's claims that the Palestinian side hasnot
fulfil its commitments under the Wye agreement. Arafat said the U.S.
Administration, EU and even Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Arens
have said that the Palestinian side has carried out is obligations
under the Wye, particularlyin the fields of security cooperation,
ratification of the Palestinian charter and confiscation of illegal
weapons in the territories.
</P>
<P>
The fact is that the Israeli government has refused to fulfil
its part of the obligations under the Wye, refusing to pullout its
troops from the West Bank, to release 750 Palestinian political
prisoners from Israeli jais and submit the time table for their
release, to open the safee passageways between the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, to start the construction of the Gaza port and to
implement the agreement concerning economic cooperation between the
two sides, he said.
</P>
<P>
The PNA, together with the United States and EU, is trying hard
to force Israel to implement this agreement, but the Israeli side
still rejects to do so under the pretext of holding elections in May
this year, he said, adding this is the main reason why the peace
process has faced another impasse since last December.

<HEADLINE> Bonn Offers New Kosovo Peace Initiative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The German government on Wednesday
put forward a new six-point peace proposal aiming at ending the
Kosovo conflict, expecting a swift implementation of the plan in
close coordination with the allies.
</P>
<P>
The plan has already been submitted to Germany's partners in
the European Union (EU) and NATO, Foreign Ministry spokesman
Martin Erdmann said.
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for the withdrawal of Yugoslav military and para-
military troops from Kosovo and the disbanding of the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army (KLA).
</P>
<P>
Erdmann said the plan also envisages the United Nations
Security Council to approve a mandate for the deployment of an
international peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
As soon as the peace-keepers have been deployed, aid agencies
will provide humanitarian relief to the returning refugees and
oversee the reconstruction of Kosovo. Ethnic Albanians should
return after Yugoslav troops have pulled out, he said.
</P>
<P>
The plan also foresees that a U.N.-authorised interim
government will be installed in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The German plan will form the basis of a planned peace
initiative by the foreign ministers of the Group of Eight (G-8)
nations.
</P>
<P>
The Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper said Wednesday that the plan
was discussed in Oslo between U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright and Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov.

leaders of the 15-nation EU and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
met in Brussels Wednesday to seek a political solution to the
conflict. The talks also aimed to bring Russia back into the peace
process.

WASHINGTON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Inventories at American
businesses rose a moderate 0.4 percent to a seasonally adjusted
1.09 trillion U.S. dollars in February, following no change in
January, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, business sales increased a rapid 0.9 percent to

Latin America and Russia.
</P>
<P>
The current business inventories can meet demand for 1.37
months.

<P>
MOSCOW, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Russian former Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin was appointed on Wednesday by President Boris
Yeltsin as the special presidential envoy to Yugoslavia on the
current crisis.
</P>
<P>
"It is quite logical for President Yeltsin to choose
Chernomyrdin (as the envoy), as he is a man with rich political
experience and high international prestige," a senior official was
quoted by the Itar-Tass news agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin, who is the founder and incumbent chairman of the
"Our Home Is Russia" movement, had served as prime minister for
five years before being fired last March.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin told reporters after the appointment that there
exist possibilities for Russia to stop the bloodshed in Yugoslavia
as the crisis is still at the stage without obvious winner and
loser.
</P>
<P>
Russia will continue its efforts to make NATO stop bombing
Yugoslavia and to bring the conflicting parties back to the
negotiation table, he added.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Labor Body Rules out Dialog with State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria Labor Congress (NLC) has
ruled out fresh negotiations with state governments on the newly
approved minimum wage for civil servants, media reports here said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
NLC President Adams Oshiomhole told reporters Tuesday that the
era of negotiation with states military administrators is out of
place.
</P>
<P>
He declared that nothing would be done to call off the on-going
strike unless states administrators agreed to implement the new
wages and urged all workers in the 28 states, where the strike was
ordered on Tuesday, to remain adamant until their demands were
met.
</P>
<P>
The NLC had directed its members in 28 of 36 states to go on
strike because the state governments failed to pay the new minimum
wage agreed upon at a meeting in capital Abuja on March 13 between
the federal government and labor representatives.
</P>
<P>
By the agreement, the federal government and four states of
Delta, Bayelsa, Lagos and Rivers, are to pay 3,500 naira (39 U.S.
dollars) while workers in the remaining 32 states will get 3,000
naira (about 33 dollars) each.
</P>
<P>
However, eight states, which were said to have implemented the
new salary scale, are exempted from the on-going strike.
</P>
<P>
Following its Central Working Committee meeting held last
Thursday, the NLC had issued directive to civil servants in 28
states to commence indefinite strike beginning from April 13 to
protest against the non- payment of the approved 3,000-naira
minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
As the industrial dispute began Tuesday, government businesses
were virtually paralyzed in some states while the NLC members in
some states backed out of the strike.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Military Calls for Cease-fire in E. Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian military Wednesday
called for a cease-fire between warring groups in the troubled
province of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Both pro-independence and pro-integration groups must stop
attacking one another by laying down their weapons under the
supervision of neutral parties, military spokesman Maj. Gen.
Syamsul Maarif said here.
</P>
<P>
The armed forces expect the East Timor dispute to be settled
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
"We hope for a more conducive security condition in the
province. However, we could not only stay out if we see our
members and innocent people being attacked," he said.
</P>
<P>
Fighting has escalated between pro-independence and
pro-integration groups since jailed East Timorese pro-independence
leader Xanana Gusmao called for war against the Indonesian
military on April 5.
</P>
<P>
"Since Xanana made the call, attacks against security forces
and pro-integration groups (in East Timor) have escalated. We have
to protect them by increasing our patrols," Maarif said.
</P>
<P>
He said the armed forces would appreciate it if Xanana revoked
his call in an effort to create a more peaceful situation in East
Timor.
</P>
<P>
According to Ana Gomes, head of the Portuguese Section at the
Netherlands Embassy here, Xanana will issue a written statement
within a couple of days to retract the call.
</P>
<P>
But a member of Xanana's legal team told reporters here
Wednesday that Xanana will not do so.
</P>
<P>
Xanana's statement should be seen as a reflection of the
violence that has been occurring in East Timor from January to
March this year, said Hendardi, chairman of the Indonesian Legal
Aid Institute.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President B.J. Habibie Tuesday endorsed the
establishment of an independent rights commission to disarm
warring factions in East Timor and restore peace so an
international presence would not be needed there.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, with a population of some 800,000 and an area of
15,000 square kilometers, had been a Portuguese colony until 1975
and became an Indonesian province in 1976, but the United Nations
never recognized the move.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas would present the
government's final autonomy proposal during his two-day meeting
with his Portuguese counterpart, Jaime Gama, in New York on April
21.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government has set up a Steering Committee for
the Composition of the Draft of the Autonomy Plan.
</P>
<P>
President Habibie has repeatedly stated that Indonesia will
allow East Timor to become an independent state if the people vote
to reject the autonomy proposal.

<HEADLINE> Seoul Calls for Return of U.S.-Held Properties, SOFA Revision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 14 (Xinhua) -- South Korea on Wednesday urged the
United States to return South Korean properties used by the U.S.
embassy and troops in the country and to revise the Status of
Forces Agreement (SOFA) before the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
In his speech titled "Korea-U.S. Relations in the 21st Century"
to the Korean-American Association Wednesday, Foreign and Trade
Minister Hong Soon-young said those issues should be resolved to
forge closer cooperative ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"We hope for an early closure on matters remaining unresolved
between South Korea and the United States, such as the return of
the Korean government properties used by the U.S. authorities and
the work of amending the Status of Forces Agreement," Hong said.
</P>
<P>
Such issues should not be left to stand in the way of the
development of the South Korea-U.S. partnership for the new
century, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
South Korea and the United States are reportedly seeking to
reopen talks on the SOFA this year, which regulates the
administrative affairs of 37,000 U.S. troops stationed in South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
However, the SOFA talks have made no headway since a bilateral
meeting in 1996 failed to agree on how to take judicial steps
against the crimes committed by American soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The United States is planning to return two of the seven Korean
properties, including the American Center in Pusan.
</P>
<P>
So far, the United States has used several South Korean
government properties, including the current U.S. Embassy building
and the Yongsan military complex in Seoul, for half a century
since the establishment of the U.S. military government in South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, the United States promised to return the embassy site
to South Korea in 1995, but didn't keep the promise, citing the
breakup of a commercial deal with Samsung designed to raise the
fund for the construction of a new embassy building.

TEHRAN, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Hamid Reza Asefi here Wednesday expressed concern over the escaltion
of the crisis in the sensitive Balkan region following reports of
conflict on Yugoslav-Albanian border.
</P>
<P>
If the reports on border conflict and violation of Yugoslav
military forces against northern Albania are true, the issue is a

<HEADLINE> Japan Regrets Pakistan's Missile Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Japan on Wednesday expressed regret
at Pakistan's test of an intermediate range Ghauri II missile
earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Japan "truly regrets" the missile test by Pakistan, said
Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Sadaaki Numata in a statement.
He added that it could threaten the peace and stability in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan tested the ballistic missile in response to New
Delhi's test of its own intermediate range Agni II missile over
the weekend, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Ghauri II missile was launched at 10:45 a.m. (0545 GMT)
from the Jhelum district, about 100 kilometers southeast of the
capital of Islamabad, landed eight minutes later near Jiwani in
southwestern Baluchistan province and hit a target there.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, Numata also voiced concern that the missile
tests by both India and Pakistan may heighten tension in South
Asia and reverse the trend of dialogue reflected in the Lahore
Declaration issued by the two countries in February.
</P>
<P>
Japan urges both New Delhi and Islamabad to refrain from
conducting further missile tests and "to engage in constructive
efforts to avoid a deterioration of the regional situation," the
statement said.

<HEADLINE> UK Police Given Ethnic Recruitment Targets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- British Home Secretary Jack Straw
announced on Wednesday the targets for the recruitment of black
and Asian officers for every police force in England and Wales.
</P>
<P>
Straw said he hoped that in 10 years' time, every force in
England and Wales would reflect the racial make-up of the area it
served.
</P>
<P>
"There is a real determination within the police service by
officers of every rank to put the past in terms of attitudes to
race behind them," the home secretary said.
</P>
<P>
The report on police handling of the racist murder of the south
London teenager Stephen Lawrence prompted the reform.
</P>
<P>
The Metropolitan Police in London, which investigated the death
of the black 18-year-old, faces one of the toughest challenges.
</P>
<P>
Only 3.3 percent of its officers are black or Asian, according
to Home Office figures. It will have to increase this to more than
a quarter in line with London's population.
</P>
<P>
Only four of England and Wales' 43 regional forces are on track
to meet the targets.
</P>
<P>
Home Office research also showed that black and Asian police
officers are almost three times more likely to be sacked than
their white colleagues, and it takes a black constable about 18
months longer to be promoted to sergeant than a white constable
and 12 months longer for Asian officers.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Bans Cattle From Three Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Thai News Agency (TNA) reported on Wednesday that Thailand
imposed the ban after a few different strains of a deadly cattle
virus had been found in Malaysia since last October, killing an
unspecified number of pigs, as well as 95 people.
</P>
<P>
All the found strains of the virus were carried by cattle,
especially pigs in three Malaysian states of Perak, Negri Sembilan
and Salangor, TNA quoted Vichai Chokvivat, an expert of the Thai
Ministry of Public Health, as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The Thai government, concerning the safety of local
consumers, decided to impose a temporary ban on imports of pigs,
horses, cats and pork from Malaysia after the three-typed animals
were found to be carriers of a new strain of the deadly virus," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said people could be directly infected by the new strain of
virus, called Nipha, when touching the cattle infected by the
swine disease.
</P>
<P>
The previously found strain, called the Japanese Encephalitis
(JE) that was usually found in monkeys, tigers, rats, birds, pigs,
horses, cattle and poultry, was not directly transmitted to human
beings through touching of the infected cattle or consumption of
the infected meat, but through mosquitoes that were JE carriers,
Vichai said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Public Health has called on Thai
people not to panic over the disease and said that the
multi-strained cattle virus will not spread into Thailand, as
measures to prevent the spread of the disease are effective,
including stringent border controls to stem smuggled pigs and pork
from Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
No trace of the swine disease in local markets has been found
so far from samples obtained from local slaughter houses and
imported pork.
</P>
<P>
However, since a strain of the deadly virus, called Hendra, was
found in Australia in 1994, the Thai government took cautious
preventive measures by imposing a ban on cattle imports from that
country and its close neighbor New Zealand as well.

<HEADLINE> China Enjoys Promising Prospects for Continuing Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Dr. Frank Burris, president of
the International Association for Continuing Engineering Education
(IACEE), said here today that continuing education has played a
crucial role in promoting the rapid development of the Chinese
economy, as well as the country's scientific and technological
progress.
</P>
<P>
Anders Hagstorm, assistant secretary-general of the IACEE,
pointed out that an increasing number of ordinary Chinese
employees will receive lifelong continuing education in the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
He said that they should not simply attend lectures, but should
instead improve their learning skills, "especially their ability
to use the Internet."
</P>
<P>
China's continuing education continues to grow hand in hand
with the nation's reform and opening efforts. The initial purpose
of the continuing education program was to update the knowledge
structure of technicians and management personnel in pillar
industries such as metallurgy and petrochemicals. Efforts centered
on enhancing their ability to operate imported high-tech equipment
more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
Vice Minister of Personnel Xu Songtao said that China's
continuing education program has expanded to a wide-ranging
sectors and benefited over 30 million professionals.
</P>
<P>
Reports indicate that scientific and technological progress
contribute some 30 percent of China's gross national product (GNP),
a figure much lower than the 60-80 percent level in developed
countries.
</P>
<P>
Xu said the long-term strategy for a populous country such as
China should not simply center on expanding economic growth by
consuming limited capital, resources and cheap labor.
</P>
<P>
"Incorporating continuing education into the strategy of
'using science and technology to invigorate the nation' is the
only way China can achieve sustainable and rapid economic
development," said Xu.

<HEADLINE> EU Leaders to Meet UN Chief on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) leaders
are scheduled to meet U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to discuss
Kosovo crisis during their informal summit meeting in Brussels
later on Wednesday as NATO intensified its three-week-long air
strikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Germany, the current EU presidency, put forward a
diplomatic proposal on Kosovo earlier Wednesday that offered
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic a 24-hour ceasefire of NATO
air strikes if he promises to withdraw his forces from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Foreign Minister of Germany Ludger Vollmer said in Bonn
Wednesday that he had worked out a multi-stage plan which also
permitted the return of refugees under the protection of
international peacekeeping troops.
</P>
<P>
The EU summit meeting will begin at 5 p.m. local time with a
session on Kosovo, followed by a working dinner with the European
Commission's president-designate,Romano Prodi, who will soon
replace Jacques Santer.
</P>
<P>
The brief informal summit was initially called to confirm the
nomination of Prodi as the EU executive's new president, and to
exchange views with him on necessary measures to reform the EU
institution and ensure the smooth functioning of the commission.
</P>
<P>
However, the deteriorating Kosovo crisis has overshadowed the
future of 15-nation European Union since unprecedented refugee
problems have become critical for security and stability in Europe.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, the EU leaders are also expected to
exchange views in anticipation of the NATO summit on its 50th
anniversary, and matters on a joint strategy towards Russia, in
the context of the EU's common foreign and security policy, EU
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The German presidency has claimed that the EU should stress
the need to seize any opportunity for achieving a peaceful
settlement of the Kosovo conflict. Germany also said it sees a
vital need to draw on Russia's full potential and its preferential
relationship with Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Annan is expected to meet NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana
first Before attending the EU summit, sources said.

<HEADLINE> UK's Cook Discourages Kosovo's Full Independence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook said Wednesday that full independence for Kosovo would not be
a good choice for the states in the Balkans and for the Albanians
in that region as well.
</P>
<P>
"Many of the neighboring countries would be deeply destabilized
by that nation (an independent Kosovo)," Cook told a parliamentary
committee.
</P>
<P>
Describing Kosovo as a small, landlocked area with little
indigenous wealth, Cook insisted that "the concept of total
independence ... is one that they would be wise to ponder
carefully before opting for it".
</P>
<P>
The foreign secretary said peace proposals for the region drawn
up in the Rambouillet plan in February offered a form of
international protectorate for Kosovo, with thousands of
international troops providing protection.
</P>
<P>
Under the Rambouillet Accord, Kosovo would remain a province of
Serbia within the Yugoslav Federation, but would have "substantial
autonomy." Its status would be reviewed after three years.
</P>
<P>
The Kosovo Albanians agreed to the Rambouillet plan but
Belgrade rejected it. The Yugoslav government said the deployment
of foreign troops in Kosovo strongly violated the sovereignty of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Cook called the accord a future basis for the settlement of the
Kosovo issue, but "not a Trojan horse leading to independence."
</P>
<P>
Western powers have resisted supporting Kosovo Albanians'
demands for full independence from Yugoslavia, partly because of
the fear that neighboring countries like Macedonia, with sizable
Albanian populations, would be destabilized.

both he and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright have agreed

But Russia's stand is that there should be no military action
without the agreement of the Yugoslav Federation. Otherwise, it is
not a protection of peaceful accord but a military compulsory
measure, Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov maintained that further efforts should be made to try to
find a solution to the crisis, which would both meet the needs of

<HEADLINE> Sharif Announces Successful Launching of Ghauri-II Missile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
said Wednesday Pakistan has successfully launched a Ghauri-II
medium-range ballistic missile after its successful launching of
Ghauri-I a year ago.
</P>
<P>
During a briefing in Ormara navy base in the southwestern
province of Balochistan, Sharif said Pakistan successfully
test-fired Ghauri-II, the second generation of Ghauri series, at
10:45 a.m. local time (05:45 GMT) at Tilla Jogian, Jehlum, in
northern Punjab province, about 100 kilometers southeast of
Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
The missile hit the pre-prepared target in Jewani in coastal
area of Balochistan bordering Iran after completing a flight range
of 1,150 kilometers in about 12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said the Ghauri-II missile, with a payload capacity of
1,000 kilograms, has an effective target range of 2,000
kilometers, one-third longer than the earlier version of Ghauri-I
which has a range of 1,500 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Keeping in view the lighter weight of warhead, the target range
of Ghauri-II can be further enhanced to 2,300 kilometers,
according to the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Due to the non-availability of enough depth in Pakistan
required to carry out the test to its full range, the Ghauri-II
was tested at a reduced range of 1,150 kilometers, said Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Similar to Ghauri-I, Sharif said the Ghauri-II missile can also
be launched from a mobile launching system in any part of
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"The credit of the second successful launching of Ghauri
missile goes to our nuclear scientists," said the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the News Network International, an independent local
news agency, quoted informed sources as saying that Pakistan will
carry out another Ghauri missile test-fire shortly.
</P>
<P>
The target will be in the sea to expand the range this time,
said the NNI report.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan test-fired a Ghauri-I missile on April 6, 1998, from
the same site.
</P>
<P>
The missile test-firing Wednesday is a matching response by
Pakistan to India's Agni-II test-firing last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
India announced Sunday that it launched at 09:47 local time
(0417 GMT) an Agni-II ballistic missile from Wheeler island in
Balasore District, eastern state of Orissa.
</P>
<P>
Agni-II, with a maximum range of 2,500 kilometers, can hit any
target in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the Indian announcement, Pakistani Foreign
Minister Sartaj Aziz said his country will give a "befitting
response", hinting at a tit-for-tat missile test-fire by Pakistan.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Sees Record Rice Output in 1st Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' rice and corn
harvests for the first quarter of 1999 are expected to reach the
highest levels since 1994, the Philippines News Agency said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The country's acting Agriculture Secretary William Dar was
quoted as saying rice production for the first quarter is expected
to reach 2.92 million metric tons, 31 percent more than a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
Corn output is forecast to reach 1.27 million metric tons, 62
percent higher than last year's yield for the same period, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The forecasts were based on a field monitoring survey conducted
by the Bureau of Agriculture Statistics of the Department of
Agriculture as of March 15, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Good weather coupled with sufficient rains in most parts of the
country during the last quarter of 1998 contributed to these
record yields, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to good weather conditions, such performance could
be attributed to the use of certified seeds, provision of
irrigation and adoption of appropriate production and post-harvest
technologies, it said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Strategists Put Forward New Security Concept </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- China should take immediate steps
to develop a security concept in terms of political security,
military security and economic security taking into account rising
international instability, especially that caused by the Asian
financial crisis and military conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The view was aired at a related one-day seminar which was
attended by more than 100 economists, financial experts, retired
generals and diplomats who all agreed that action should be taken
with some urgency and as a matter of national security.
</P>
<P>
Delegates were told that this is a vital move as the world
economy becomes increasingly integrated, and there is closer
economic and financial interaction globally.
</P>
<P>
The Asian financial crisis, for example, was caused by a
massive trans-national flow of capital in a short period and shook
the world's financial systems, slowing down economic growth. This
led to raging instability and as a result change of government,
violent in some cases, in a number of nations. Regional security
and international relations have thus been severely affected, the
delegates were told.
</P>
<P>
Adding to this the resurrection of the old cold-war mentality,
growing hegemony and power politics are an indication that caution
and concern are high priorities for China. Unholy military
alliances are also being strengthened across the world and "
gunboat" policies are once again running rampant.
</P>
<P>
The high level delegates were told, in conclusion, that these
situations are closely related to the new imbalance of world
economic power and are the essential reasons why China needs to
protect itself from every angle.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was hosted by Xiong Guangkai, deputy chief of
general staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and
president of the China Institute for International Strategic
Studies.

<HEADLINE> Vajpayee Government Faces New Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The Indian coalition government
led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is facing new crisis as a
major ally of the BJP withdrew support to it Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
All-India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), which has 18
MPs in the Lower House of Parliament, announced its withdrawal of
support to the government of Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee
Wednesday morning. AIADMK chief C. Jayalalitha Jayaram handed over
a letter informing of the withdrawal of support to President K. R.
Narayanan when she called on him.
</P>
<P>
Talking to newsmen after her 45-minute meeting with the
president, Jayalalitha said the opposition parties would be
successful in forming an alternative government. A non-confidence
motion against the Vajpayee government would be moved at the
Parliament when it resumes its sitting on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The crisis emerged after the Vajpayee government firmly
rejected two demands of AIADMK to dismiss Defense Minister George
Fernandes for "his involvement in corruption" and to reinstate
Admiral Vishnu Bhagwat, who was dismissed by the government
earlier as chief of the naval staff.
</P>
<P>
"We withdrew support with immediate effect because we feel it
(Vajpayee's government) is a threat to the national security and
it is simply not interested in protecting the nation's
sovereignty," Jayalalitha said.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the AIADMK decision, Congress Party President Sonia
Gandhi had an emergency meeting with several party leaders to
finalize a new strategy. The party, the biggest opposition in
Parliament, welcomed the withdrawal step and demanded that
Vajpayee resign immediately.
</P>
<P>
"With the withdrawal of support by AIADMK and (earlier
withdrawal of support of) Indian National Lok Dal, the ruling
coalition has lost its majority in the Lower House of Parliament
and the government is reduced to minority," Congress Party
Spokesman Arjun Singh said here in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The government has no moral, constitutional and political
right to continue in office," he said.
</P>
<P>
A delegation of Congress will call on the president Wednesday
evening and this was confirmed by a presidential spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Congress, other opposition parties have also urged
Vajpayee to resign following the withdrawal of support by AIADMK.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, however, Wednesday asserted that the
BJP-led government would be able to prove its majority on the
floor of the Lower House whenever required. Addressing the BJP
parliamentary party executive on the eve of the crucial parliament
session from Thursday, Vajpayee said the government had enough
support to frustrate the game plan of the opposition.
</P>
<P>
When asked about whether she would support a Congress
government with outside support of other opposition parties,
Jayalalitha said Wednesday that the question of what type of
government it would be and who would be the prime minister could
only be decided after discussions among leaders of all opposition
parties. On whether Congress was ready to form a government, party
senior leader Arjun Singh said, "if we are asking the government
to resign it is not just an empty gesture."

<HEADLINE> Private Business Boosts China's Tax Revenue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Almost half of China's annual tax
revenue now comes from the non-state-owned sector which is the
main growth area for the government's taxation revenues.
</P>
<P>
There was an increase of 100 billion yuan in tax revenue last
year and State Administration of Taxation (SAT) Commissioner Jin
Renqing said that he expects tax revenues to reach 946 billion
yuan this year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by the SAT reveal that more than 418
billion yuan (over 50 billion US dollars) of tax was generated
from the non-state-owned sector -- private companies, collectively-
owned businesses and overseas-funded enterprises -- in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The SAT says and that taxes paid by foreign-funded enterprises
have increased by more than 600 times over the past 20 years,
reaching 123.3 billion yuan (15 billion US dollars) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, taxes from share-holding companies grew at a
rate of 81.9 percent every year, while taxes from other private
businesses grew 21 percent annually. Both exceeded the annual
growth rate of China's overall taxation level, which stood at 16
percent.
</P>
<P>
SAT official Zheng Wenmin also revealed that on the other hand
the state-owned sector's tax contributions have been shrinking,
dropping from 75 percent in 1978 to 54 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
He added, "China values the non-state sector as an "
indispensable part" of the economy and is readjusting the taxation
system to give it an increasingly fair and favorable environment
in which to operate."
</P>
<P>
For example, he explained, it is restructuring the tax system
for foreign-funded companies in order to give them the same
treatment as Chinese companies.

<HEADLINE> Australia Regrets Pakistani Missile Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Australia deeply regrets
Pakistan's test of a Gharui medium-range ballistic missile on
April 14, Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan's test, following closely after the ballistic missile
test conducted by India on April 11, raises the disturbing
prospect of a missile arms race in South Asia and of nuclear
weaponization by India and Pakistan, further heightening tensions
in this unstable region of the world," Downer said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"I urge both countries to refrain from entering into a
destabilizing missile arms race," the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
"The latest actions by both India and Pakistan are particularly
regrettable given the recent positive developments in
Indo-Pakistani relations," including resumption of bilateral talks
at foreign secretary level and the visit on February by Indian
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to Lahore to meet his
counterpart, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif for an open dialogue on
bilateral issues, including security concerns, Downer said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the two countries to comply with the conditions laid
down by U.N. Security Council Resolution 1172, adopted following
the nuclear tests by the two countries in 1998.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the two countries to sign and ratify the
Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty without further delay.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Cuts Power Rate for Distressed Industries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada Wednesday announced a 45-to-55 centavo power rate
reduction for power-intensive and distressed industries in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Estrada told reporters that for distressed industries in Luzon,
the northern Philippines, and the Visayas in the middle south of
the country, power rates will be reduced by 45 centavos (about 1
U.S. cent) per kilowatt hour.
</P>
<P>
For Mindanao, the southern Philippines, the effective reduction
will match or even exceed the rate drop in Luzon and the Visayas,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The power rate cuts will be effective from May to December 31
this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the move was part of his administration's
commitment to helping industries cope with the effects of the
Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Estrada administration proposed an Economic Recovery
Assistance Program last February, hoping to reduce the production
cost for industries suffering badly from the crisis.

NICOSIA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The British aircraft carrier, HMS
Invincible, has sailed from Cyprus for the Adriatic, where it will join
in the NATO's air strikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus Mail newspaper reported on Wednesday that the 20,600-ton
Invincible is accompanied by the destroyer HMS Newcastle and the support

war machine, Need said.
</P>
<P>
Invincible, which carries seven Sea Harrier jet fighter-bombers and
10 Sea King helicopters, is expected to reach the Adriatic on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Greater Concern Urged for Juvenile Delinquency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Jiang Chunyun, a vice chairman of
the National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, recently
conducted a fact-finding tour in southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Regions and stressed the need to focus greater
attention on the issue of juvenile delinquency.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that society as a whole should exhibit greater
concern for the younger generation and called for applying the
rule of law to education and protection of youngsters and
preventing juvenile delinquency.
</P>
<P>
China's 200 million youngsters account for approximately one
sixth of the nation's total population, said Jiang, adding that
the noticeable increase in juvenile delinquency in recent years
has sparked the grave concern of the central leadership and people
from all walks of life.
</P>
<P>
Preventing juvenile delinquency requires systematic social
engineering, said Jiang, noting that Communist Party organizations
and governments at all levels should mobilize members of the
general public to create a sound social environment for prevention.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party
of China (CPC) Central Committee, called for greater efforts in
crack down on pornography, gambling and drugs which are a primary
cause of juvenile delinquency.
</P>
<P>
The NPC vice chairman visited local villages, companies and
education-through-labor institutions between April 5-13. He also
participated in a series of discussions with ordinary citizens,
local NPC deputies and legal experts concerning draft law on
juvenile delinquency.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also inspected implementation of laws governing the
organization of villagers' committees and flood control.

<HEADLINE> Mosquito Biting After 10 PM Most Dangerous: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- It is more dangerous to be
bitten by a mosquito after 10 p.m. than earlier in the night, a
study by Australian scientists has revealed.
</P>
<P>
In a major breakthrough in mosquito studies, Australian
researchers have found that mosquitoes carrying viruses are more
likely to be in search of a tasty arm or leg for a meal late at
night.
</P>
<P>
The discovery was made by researchers from the University of
South Australia's Mosquito Research Laboratory, led by Michael
Kokkinn, who are studying the Culex annulirostris or banded
mosquito, the Australian Associated Press (AAP) reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This species is the most dangerous mosquito in Australia
because it carries all of the deadly viruses in the country,
including Ross River Virus, Japanese Encephalitis and Murray
Valley Encephalitis.
</P>
<P>
Kokkinn said researchers conducted "all night biting catches",
where they sat outside for 10 minutes every hour with a small
patch of skin exposed and caught every mosquito which came to
feast on them.
</P>
<P>
They found that younger female mosquitoes fed earlier in the
night, probably because they had to eat early before finding a
mate, while the older mosquitoes who didn't need to mate came out
in force after 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
Only female mosquitoes bite and instinctively seek blood for
the development of eggs in their bodies. Male and female
mosquitoes also feed off other sources such as plant juices.
</P>
<P>
Younger mosquitoes are less dangerous because they are less
likely to have bitten an animal or bird and picked up a disease.
</P>
<P>
From 10 p.m., "you get more and more of the older girls coming
along," Dr. Kokkinn was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The trouble is if you are an older girl and you have bitten a
kangaroo for instance, you might have picked up a virus. That's
where the older girls are more dangerous".
</P>
<P>
Dr. Kokkinn said different species of mosquitoes were
attracted to different things, but generally people with warmer
bodies who have a high metabolic rate and produce lots of carbon
dioxide were the likeliest mosquito magnets.
</P>
<P>
People with smooth skin and darker complexions were also more
at risk, while mosquitoes generally disliked those with
ginger-blonde hair and dry skin.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Successfully Test-Fires Ghauri-II Missile by Wang Wei </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan successfully
test-fired a Ghauri-II (HAFT-V) ballistic missile Wednesday
morning as a tit-for-tat response to India's Agni-II ballistic
missile test-firing Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Ghauri-II missile was launched at 10:45 a.m. local time
(05:45 GMT) from Tilla Jogian, Jehlum, in northern Punjab
province, about 100 kilometers southeast of Islamabad, Captain
Muhammad Alam from the Kahuta Research Laboratory (KRL), which
carried out the test, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
According to Alam, the missile hit the target at North Jawani,
southwestern Balochistan province bordering Iran after 14 minutes'
flight over a range of 1,380 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has congratulated the
scientists who conducted the flight test, according to a press
release issued by the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Sources from KRL said the Ghauri-II ballistic missile launched
Wednesday weighted 13 tons and is capable of carrying a nuclear or
conventional warhead of 500 to 600 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
The maximum range of Ghauri-II, which can be fired from high
mobile launcher, could be extended to about 2,300 kilometers, said
the sources.
</P>
<P>
The test is "part of the research and development of Pakistan's
indigenous missile program" which is "an essential element of our
policy of maintaining deterrence in the interest of our security,"
said the Foreign Ministry press release.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan informed India about the planned missile test-firing
Tuesday, keeping in line with certain understanding reached at
Lahore between the two countries in February.
</P>
<P>
According to local media reports, preparations are underway to
test-fire another type of ballistic missile, Shaheen, in a couple
of days ahead.
</P>
<P>
Scientists and experts are currently staying at a navy base in
southern Pakistan, waiting for the greenlight for the flight test.
</P>
<P>
They are expected to leave the base by Friday, said
highly-placed official sources.
</P>
<P>
Ghauri-II, the upgraded version of Ghauri-I, is a
surface-to-surface intermediate-range ballistic missile, which has
the capability to cover the whole territory of India.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan test-fired a Ghauri-I missile, which has a maximum
range of 1,500 kilometers with a payload of 700 kilograms, on
April 6, 1998, from the same site.
</P>
<P>
The fresh missile test-firing is a matching response by
Pakistan to India's Agni-II test-firing last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
India announced Sunday that it launched at 09:47 local time
(0417 GMT) an Agni-II ballistic missile from Wheeler island in
Balasore District of the eastern state of Orissa.
</P>
<P>
Agni-II, with a maximum range of 2,500 kilometers, can hit any
target in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee compared the
test-firing to its nuclear tests in May last year, saying it is
"also a purely defensive step."
</P>
<P>
But Pakistan does not think so.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the Indian announcement, Pakistani Foreign
Minister Sartaj Aziz said his country will give a "befitting
response," hinting at a tit-for-tat missile test-firing by
Pakistan.

<HEADLINE> Highway Construction Stimulates GDP Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- China's highway construction has
boosted the growth of the nation's economy, Deputy Minister of
Communications Li Juchang said.
</P>
<P>
Every 100 million yuan of investment in highways has produced
nearly 300 million yuan of social output, which added 40 million
yuan to the gross domestic product, and provided 2,000 job
opportunities in the highway construction sector and 5,000 for
related sectors.
</P>
<P>
This means that every yuan spent on highway construction has
brought about 2.6 yuan in GDP, he said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, China spent 211.8 billion yuan constructing 37,000
kilometers of highways, including 1,487 kilometers of expressways,
increasing the total length of the country's highways to 1.26
million kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Li said that highway construction overall employed 2.53 million
workers on a monthly basis and consumed 3.06 million tons of steel
and 1.05 million cubic meters of timber in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Kodak Products, Services To Be World-Class in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Eastman Kodak Company, the
world's leading film developers, will bring its color printing
network in China up to world standard in three years.
</P>
<P>
John Tseng, vice president and general manager of the
department of consumer imaging of Kodak's greater China region,
said in an interview today that the upgrading will take place at
all "Kodak Express" film printing centers in Beijing and Shanghai
first.
</P>
<P>
"People in these two major cities will be able to enjoy world-
class service that is no different from that in the U.S.," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kodak's ambitious project is set to cover more than 3,500 Kodak
Express centers in some 350 cities throughout China.
</P>
<P>
World standards will be implemented on resolution control,
operational skills, and service quality -- the first two of which
are seen as the essential elements for printing quality.
</P>
<P>
At the ongoing China International Photograph and Electrical
Imaging Machinery and Technology Fair here, Kodak is exhibiting a
model Kodak Express in its show area, which is the largest among
all exhibitors of at the fair. "Everything in this store will be
the same as in developed countries, except for the language used,"
Tseng said.
</P>
<P>
But of course, he added, the charges in China are lower because
people here can afford less and labor is cheaper.
</P>
<P>
To tap further into China's imaging service, Kodak also
introduced digital picture post service in cooperation with
China's State Post Bureau three months ago.
</P>
<P>
This service is provided in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou,
and is the first in China to combine imaging, digital technology,
the Internet, and the postal network.
</P>
<P>
China has become a production center for Kodak film, as well.
About a year ago, Kodak announced that it would invest 1 billion U.
S. dollars in the country's imaging material industry.
</P>
<P>
The company's joint venture in the coastal city of Xiamen,
Fujian Province, is now turning out Kodak film with the "Made in
China" label, and this film is expected to be exported to other
Asian countries by next year.
</P>
<P>
China is the world's second largest imaging product and service
market, but its potential is far from fully tapped, and is
expected to move into first place by 2010 or earlier, and become a
major manufacturer in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Kodak's actual investment will exceed the committed amount of
one billion dollars, according to Tseng, and his company is
interested in more involvement in China's digital imaging industry.

<P>
NLC President Comrade Adams Oshiomhole told reporters Tuesday
that the era of negotiation with states military administrators is
out of place.
</P>
<P>
He declared that nothing would be done to call off the on-going
strike unless states administrators agreed to implement the new
wages and urged all workers in the 28 states, where the strike was
ordered on Tuesday, to remain adamant until their demands were
met.
</P>
<P>
The NLC had directed its members in 28 of 36 states to go on
strike because the state governments failed to pay the new minimum
wage agreed upon at a meeting in capital Abuja on March 13 between
the federal government and labor representatives.
</P>
<P>
By the agreement, the federal government and four states of
Delta, Bayelsa, Lagos and Rivers, are to pay 3,500 Naira (about
38.9 U.S. Dollars) while workers in the remaining 32 states will
get 3,000 Naira (about 33.3 Dollars) each.
</P>
<P>
However, eight states, which were said to have implement the
new salary scale, are exempted from the on-going strike.
</P>
<P>
Following its Central Working Committee meeting held last
Thursday, the NLC had issued directive to civil servants in 28
states to commence indefinite strike beginning from April 13 to
protest against the non- payment of the approved 3,000 Naira
minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
As the industrial dispute began on Tuesday, government
businesses were virtually paralyzed in some states while the NLC
members in some states backed out of the strike.

<HEADLINE> "Fourth Media" To Dominate in 21st Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The power of the "fourth media",
the Internet and information super-highway, will probably outweigh
the traditional media -- newspapers, radio and television within
one or two decades, delegates to an international conference on
the press were told today.
</P>
<P>
"Press communities all over the world are undergoing a major
reform," said Zhou Guangzhao, vice-chairman of the Standing
Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress and chairman
of the China Association for Science and Technology, at the
opening ceremony of the Second Asia-Pacific Symposium on the press
and scientific and social progress.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the development of the fourth media will be
a great gift for the 21st Century.
</P>
<P>
"Nowadays, reporters are able to use the Internet to cover and
write news stories all over the world, and can send out their
stories worldwide at any time," said Ellis Rubinstein, chief
editor of American's prestigious Science magazine.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Internet has provided rich information sources
and opportunities for reporters, and that the wide use of the
fourth media is gradually changing the work style of news people.
</P>
<P>
"The development of Internet techniques will have a substantial
impact on the development of newspapers in the Chinese language,"
said Wang Xuan, an academician with the Chinese Academy of
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
The growth of the Internet since 1993 has been phenomenal with
now an estimated 150 million people worldwide regularly surfing
and this is expected to double by the year 2001. This growth rate
far surpasses that of radio and television which took several
decades to reach comparable figures.
</P>
<P>
The four-day symposium, with the theme "Science and Technology
and the Development Strategy of Newspapers in the 21st Century",
is jointly sponsored by the Ministry of Science and Technology,
the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the China Science and Technology
Association, the Xinhua News Agency and the Chinese Foreign
Language Press Institute.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from more than 100 news organizations, research
institutes and enterprises in the Asian-Pacific region attended
the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Asian Nations Gear Up to Woo Visitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The crack of two ceramic bowls
before the end of a traditional Indonesian dance took the audience
by
surprise and marked the beginning of an Asian effort to bring
tourists back to the region plagued by a serious but receding
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
More than 330 international exhibitors from 37 countries and
regions are taking part in the 22nd Pacific Asia Travel
Association
Travel Market (PTM), which officially opened here on Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
Asia's once booming travel industry has suffered a severe slump

since the economic crisis first hit Thailand two years ago and
spread
to some other countries in the region later.
</P>
<P>
The four-day tourism promotion event, in which Indonesia is the

feature country, coincided with preliminary but favorable signs of
a
recovery in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The Asian exhibitors have come to the event with a hearty wish
to
win their valued customers back.
</P>
<P>
LET'S GO TO INDONESIA!
</P>
<P>
The slogan sung by Marzuki Usman, Indonesian minister of
tourism,
in his opening address at the PTM, represented a government effort
to
change people's impression of a country that had been plagued by
the
financial crisis and rocked by riots.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia experienced a negative growth in visitor arrivals in
1998, suffering a 16-percent decline from 1997.
</P>
<P>
Marzuki insisted that "It is not as bad as it looks" while
referring to the riots and political instability in the populous
Southeast Asian country.
</P>
<P>
He announced promotion measures aimed at reviving tourism and
thus
the country's troubled economy, including the opening of some
religious sites for worship tourism and visa extension for elderly

foreign visitors.
</P>
<P>
The breaking of two bowels in the welcome-to-Indonesia
performance
before the opening ceremony, said an Indonesian tourism official,
carries a message reminding the Indonesian people of the difficult

times and also of the hope to cast away the bad luck.
</P>
<P>
"AN INVITATION TO MILLENNIAMANIA PARTY."
</P>
<P>
Singapore will take the opportunity as the PTM host to sell the
country's millennial promotions, the Once-In-A-Millennium(OIM) and

MillenniaMania.
</P>
<P>
As its Indonesian neighbor, Singapore also suffered a declining

tourism last year with the number of visitor arrivals dropping by
13
percent compared with 1997.
</P>
<P>
Singapore's turn-of-the-millennium events are designed to
attract
visitors looking for a unique, exhilarating and memorable way to
mark
the occasion.
</P>
<P>
The celebrations on the advent of the new century will last for
a
15-month period, from June 1999 to August 2000, during which
Singapore will transform itself into a sensational palette of
sights,
sounds and experiences.
</P>
<P>
MillenniaMania will feature food and music festivals, sports
and
entertainment extravaganzas and celebrations, highlighting a
massive
New Year's Eve countdown street party.
</P>
<P>
The OIM program features Daily and Grand Draws which every
visitor
to Singapore between June 1999 and August 2000 will be eligible to

enter.
</P>
<P>
In addition to selling new promotions, the PTM provides
Singapore
with an opportunity to showcase itself as a prime MICE (meetings,
incentives, conventions and exhibitions) destination.
</P>
<P>
Singapore hosts about 100 trade shows each year, covering a wide

range of industries such as telecommunications, food, aerospace,
information technology and defense.
</P>
<P>
BICYCLE! BICYCLE!
</P>
<P>
Ever imagined cycling on the roof of the world and crossing an
arid desert in Tibet?
</P>
<P>
The kingdom of bicycles cordially invites you to savor an
adventurous bicycle tour from Lhasa, capital of Tibet in
southwestern
China, to Katmandu, capital of the mountainous country of Nepal.
</P>
<P>
This is only part of the colorful programs organized in Ecotour

China'99.
</P>
<P>
China, renowned for its historical and ancient sites, wants to
emphasize through the tour the country's greener side, ushering
international tourists into a China abundant with unique natural
resources.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan, Sichuan, Guangxi, Tibet and Guizhou, the five provinces

and autonomous regions in southwestern China famous for their
natural
and scenic beauty, will be open to visitors from all over the
world.
</P>
<P>
"The idea of ecotour was brought up with China and the rest of
the
world's growing awareness of anti-pollution and environment
protection." said Zhang Guangyu, an official with China National
Tourism Administration.
</P>
<P>
Although affected by the regional economic crisis last year,
China's tourism has seen a strong rebound since early 1999, with
the
number of visitors from major markets like South Korea, Japan and
Thailand soaring by 40 percent, 17 percent and 48 percent
respectively.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Six people were killed and seven
others wounded in northern Lebanon early Wednesday in a shootout
between Lebanese security forces and a suspected car thief gang.
</P>
<P>
The Voice of the People radio said that the killed were five
thieves and a passerby.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the security forces said that the clash took
place when 10 armed people in a Jeep Cherokee and a Land Rover refused
to stop for examination and opened fire at the soldiers at an army
checkpoint in the Madfoun village, about 40 kilometers north of
Beirut.
</P>
<P>
The jeeps were later confirmed stolen by the gang.

The mob shot automatic rifles and hurled hand grenades at the
soldiers, who responded immediately, the statement said.

In the exchange of fire, five thieves and a truck driver who
happened to be passing by were shot dead while five other bandits
and two soldiers were injured.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Coffee Trade Drops as Prices Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's coffee trade dropped last
week in line with falling world prices, the Saigon Times Daily
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The price for Vietnam's robusta 5 percent black and broken
grade dropped on last Friday at around 1.300 U.S. dollars a tone,
FOB Saigon Port, from 1,320-1,350 U.S. dollars previous week.
</P>
<P>
Last week's coffee price drop resulted reportedly from Colombia
preparing to devalue its currency to boost coffee exports rather
than from any bumper crops in Indonesia and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam, one of the world's top exporters of robusta, which is
widely used to produce instant coffee, plans to export 380,000
tones of coffee this year.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Vietnam, which harvests
coffee from October until the end of December or early January,
exported 102,000 tones of coffee in the first quarter of this
year, although traders said the actual amount could be as high as
200,000 tones.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Urged to Enforce Anti-piracy Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft, the world's largest
software company, has urged the Lebanese government to implement the
anti-piracy law approved by parliament last month, the Daily Star
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"When we enter a market, it is key that there should be a
copyright law," said Michel Lacombe, president for Microsoft's
European, Middle East and African Affairs.
</P>
<P>
"But that is only the first step. The next step is to implement
and enforce the law," he aded.
</P>
<P>
Under the strong pressure from international software companies,
especially Microsoft, Lebanese parliament last month approved the
copyright law on condition that those firms provide their products
on a discount of up to 90 percent to students, who can not afford
the costly original ones.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon is one of the high-piracy countries, with nine out of 10
programs being illegally used.
</P>
<P>
Many software manufacturers complained that they lost millions
of U.S. dollars each year on Lebanese market due to the rampant piracy.
</P>
<P>
Lacombe said he hoped to see the piracy rate drop to some 60
percent in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
"We will be concentrating on Lebanese government agencies and
large corporations first. That is as easy as picking fruit from the
tree," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he called on the Lebanese government to play its role
in enforcing the law.
</P>
<P>
"It's been our experience in emerging markets that enforcing a
piracy law helps the development of a local informatioln
technology market, We will be here to help the growth of this
industry," Lacombe said.
</P>
<P>
After Lebanese parliament approved the law, Microsoft decided to
open its regional office in Beirut to deal with its businesses for
Syria, Jordan and Cyprus.

SEOUL, April 14 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim Dae-jung
Wednesday said the top five family-owned chaebols --Hyundai,
Daewoo, Samsung LG and SK-- have to finish corporate restructuring
or face financial sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Expressing frustration over the slow progress in corporate
reform,Presidnet Kim said his government has waited long enough
and he is disappointed with their reform programs and want to see
concrete action, not lip service, from the chaebols.

they will face sanctions,'' President Kim said.

The remarks, seen as an ultimatum to the five conglomerates
which promised the government and creditor banks last December to
restructure their businesses within this year, were made at his
regular monthly meeting with the press at the Blue House.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached among the chaebols, the government
and banks on corporate restructuring,the chaebols have to cut
their debts, sell subsidiaries, shut down unprofitable units and
attract foreign capital on their own unless the banks will ban the
chaebols from drawing fresh credit, or if necessary, recall all
existing loans.
</P>
<P>
Kim pointed out that his government can no longer stake the
fate of South Korea on the debt-ridden and unprofitable
conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
"Without resolving this issue, Korea may face a recurrence of
the economic turmoil. I will be unflinching in my efforts to see
through the completion of the corporate restructuring, on which
the very fate of the Korean economy rests,'' Kim said.
</P>
<P>
Kim is supposed to meet the bosses of the chaebols next week to
assess the progress in their implementation of the corporate
reform agreement but he put off the meeting "unless they come out
with tangible measures acceptable to the people."
</P>
<P>
The government checks the progress of the top five
conglomerates' reform programs on a quarterly basis to determine
whether to continue extending loans to them.

<HEADLINE> PBOC Regulates Loans For Low-Cost Housing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China (PBOC),
China's central bank, today issued regulations covering loans for
low-cost housing.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the PBOC said that these are aimed at
supporting the construction of low-cost residential houses,
tighten up the management of loans for housing projects and
protect the legal rights and interests of debtors and creditors.
</P>
<P>
The term low-cost housing refers to residential properties that
are part of the state building plan and which will be sold to
urban medium and low-income families. The creditors are state-
owned commercial banks and other banks which offer housing loans.
</P>
<P>
The maximum outstanding term of such loans is three years with
strict rules for their use and specific punishments for any
misappropriation.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The Congress party, the biggest
opposition in Parliament, on Wednesday asked Prime Minister Atal
Behari Vajpayee to resign immediately following the withdrawal of
support to the government by All-India Anna Dravida Munnetra
Kazhagam (AIADMK), one of the government's major allies.
</P>
<P>
AIADMK withdrew its support to the Vajpayee Government and
handed over a letter of withdrawal support to the government to
President K. R. Narayanan when its chief Ms Jayalalitha called on
him here Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
"With the withdrawal of support by AIADMK and Indian National
Lok Dal (which withdrew support earlier), the ruling coalition has
lost its majority in Lok Sabha (Lower House of Parliament) and the
government reduced to minority," Congress party spokesman Arjun
Singh said in a statement here.
</P>
<P>
"The government has no moral, constitutional and political
right to continue in office. Therefore, Congress Party demands
that Vajpayee should step down forthwith in keeping with well
established democratic norms and traditions," he said.
</P>
<P>
A Congress delegation is meeting the President here Wednesday
evening in the backdrop of the AIADMK's withdrawal of support to
the government.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Vietnamese Senior Army Officers Confer in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua)-- Yu Yongbo, director of the General
Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA),
held talks with Phan Thanh Ngan, director of the General Political
Bureau of the Vietnamese People's Army, here today.
</P>
<P>
Yu, also a member of the Cental Military Committee, noted that
friendly contact between the two communist parties and the two
countries enjoy a long history, and in recent years friendly
relations between the two armies have been strengthened.
</P>
<P>
In the present complicated world situation, developing
friendship between the two countries not only accords with the
aspiration of the two peoples and their fundamental interests, but
also benefits the peace, stability and development of the region
and the world at large, he said.
</P>
<P>
The director noted that in recent years, under the leadership
of President Jiang Zemin and the guidance of Deng Xiaoping's
theory on army building, the PLA has placed the highest importance
in political work, emphasized the building of quality, and
stressed the increase of defensive capability through high-
technology.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the army realized three major achievements: it
gradually implemented the required cutting of 500,000 armed
personnel as put forward at the 15th National Congress of the
Chinese Communist Party; it won a historic battle against the
unprecedented flooding last summer together with the civilian; and
it has completed the transfer or cancellation of business units in
the army as required by the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Phan highly praised China's great overall achievements,
especially in army building, and also discussed Vietnam's
situation in this regard.

BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The demand for paper in China is
projected to grow by 10 percent on an annual basis in the next ten

Experts predict that yearly paper consumption will hit 40

demand for high-grade paper will climb while that for lower
quality paper will decline.

cents and Wednesday traded between 63.51 U.S. cents and 63.96 U.S.

At the close here the Australian dollar was buying 0.5905 euro

CHANGSHA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- An ancient burial ground with
tombs dating back more than 2,000 years has been unearthed in the
urban area of Changsha, capital of central China's Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
The tombs were found at a construction site, and archeologists
were soon called to the area. They estimate there are some 100
tombs, the oldest of which may date back to the periods of Spring
and Autumn and Warring States (770 BC-221 BC). The graveyard had
apparently been in use as recently as in the Qing Dynasty (1644-
1911).
</P>
<P>
Many relic were discovered in a dozen of tombs including iron
and steel swords and ancient cooking vessels suggesting the
cultural style of the Yue State, which flourished during the
Spring and Autumn Period.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists believe the finds are valuable for studying
exchanges among states and peoples of various ethnic groups at
that time, when several rival states were competing for power.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time ancient tombs have been found in the
urban area of Changsha.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan VP Appeals to Oil Companies to Lower Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Vice-President George
Saitoti has expressed hope that petroleum companies would make
adjustments in reflecting the changes arising in the international
oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launching ceremony of a new petrol station in
Nairobi's downtown area Tuesday, Saitoti pointed out that
petroleum companies in the country had failed to make due
adjustments in response to the price changes in the world market.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Kenya Times newspaper Wednesday quoted the
vice-president as saying that liberalization of the oil industry
in the east African country is yet to produce competitive prices
which can benefit the country' s consumers and economy.
</P>
<P>
He said the importance of the petroleum industry in Kenya was
immense as it was the main moving force behind the transportation
sector and most other industries.
</P>
<P>
The oil prices influenced the inflation rate in the economy and
were also important elements in the competitiveness of Kenya's
exports, said the vice-president.
</P>
<P>
Saitoti, who is also the Minister for Planning and National
Development, noted that the adoption of liberalization in the oil
industry was aimed at allowing market forces to play a leading
role in influencing resources allocation and price determination
so as to enhance efficiency for a more rapid growth of the
economy.
</P>
<P>
He said that the measures taken by the Kenyan government to
liberalize the industry included the removal of the price control
on all oil products and scrapping the crude oil quota of Kenya's
National Oil Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Saitoti added that transport modes were set free and more
dealers were recently allowed to enter the market, thus increasing
the competition in the oil industry.
</P>
<P>
Kenya introduced liberalization measures in the petroleum
sector in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Major Opposition Applauds Pak Missile Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Jamaat-e-Islami (JI), one of
Pakistan's major opposition parties, applauded the country's
successful launching of Ghauri-II ballistic missile Wednesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) quoted Liaqat Baluch,
senior JI official, as saying that Ghauri-II test-fire was
essential and need of the hour to make Pakistan's defense
impregnable.
</P>
<P>
Baluch suggested the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
should also go ahead with the planned Shaheen missile flight test.
</P>
<P>
He said, "the government should keep on the missile program
without compromising on national interest and should not succumb
to any external pressure in this regard."
</P>
<P>
According to media reports Wednesday, preparations are also
underway in Southern Pakistan to test the Shaheen ballistic
missile.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's scientists and experts are reported to have been
present at a navy base on the Arabian Sea coast and they are just
waiting for the greenlight from the government.
</P>
<P>
They are expected to leave the navy base by Friday, an
highly-placed government official revealed.
</P>
<P>
Besides the Ghauri series, Pakistan has two versions of the
Shaheen missiles, waiting in the wings to be tested.
</P>
<P>
-- Shaheen I has a range of 750 kilometers and is capable of
carrying a payload of 1,000 kilograms;
</P>
<P>
-- Shaheen II, an advanced version, has a planned range of
2,300 kilometers and is able to deliver a payload of conventional
or nuclear warhead with a maximum weight of 1,000 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan successfully test-fired a Ghauri-II ballistic missile
Wednesday morning in a tit-for-tat response to India's Agni-II
test last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Ghauri-II missile was launched at 10:45 a.m. local time
(05:45 GMT) from Tilla Jogian, Jehlum, in northern Punjab
province, about 100 kilometers southeast of Islamabad, Captain
Muhammad Alam from the Kahuta Research Laboratory, which carried
out the flight test, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
According to Captain Alam, the missile hit the target at North
Jawani, southwestern Balochistan province bordering Iran after 14
minutes' flight with a range of 1,380 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Laboratory said, Ghauri-II ballistic missile
launched Wednesday, weighted 13 tons and is capable of carrying a
nuclear or conventional warhead of 500 to 600 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
The maximum range of Ghauri-II, which can be fired on high
mobile launcher, could be extended to about 2,300 kilometers, said
the sources.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Egyptian Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading Egyptian newspapers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- On his way back from Asian tour to China, South Korea and
Japan, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak arrived in the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) Tuesday on a three-day visit for talks with UAE
leaders on boosting bilateral ties in various domains.
</P>
<P>
Al-Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. administration Tuesday informed the Congress it was
planning to sell to Egypt 24 F-16 combat jets as part of a 1.3
billion U.S. dollars deal.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Ministry of Defense announced that the deal also
includes engines of fighter jets, radar systems, aircraft testing
apparatuses and training equipment.
</P>
<P>
Al-Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
-- Egypt reiterated Tuesday night its full support for the UAE in
its dispute with Iran over three Gulf islands.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt backs the UAE claims to restore the three islands either by
negotiations between the two sides or through the International Court
of Justice," said Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, who is
accompanying Mubarak on a three-day visit to UAE.
</P>
<P>
The islands Abu Musa and Greater and Lesser Tunbs are potentially
oil rich and located near strategic shipping lanes close to the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Gazette:
</P>
<P>
-- Moussa said Tuesday that Mubarak's Asian tour produced an
array of positive political and economic results.
</P>
<P>
He said the timing of the tour was politically crucial because it
gave the president an opportunity to explain the reality of the
situation in the Middle East peace process ahead of May 4 deadline
set by the Palestinians to declare an independent state.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said the three countries Mubarak visited have deep
understanding of the economic transformation which took place in
Egypt and appeared willing to enhance their investments in the
country.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Overstocked Sugar Cleared </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To date, most of the 111,401 tons of sugar produced in the
country have been sold out, the Financial Times Wednesday quoted
the managing director of the SUDECO, Frank Kibonde, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the annual output of Tanzania's sugar factories
stands at 120, 000 metric tons while demand for sugar is estimated
at 300,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Although the demand is much higher, local sugar factories had
complained that cheap imports seriously suppressed the market for
locally produced sugar.
</P>
<P>
In January, the Tanzanian government began to intervene and
announced to increase the import duty on sugar from 30 percent to
60 percent in a bid to protect local industries.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Kibonde said Tanzania's rate of import duty on sugar
is still low compared to other countries in east Africa, like
Kenya with 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
The managing director acknowledged that Tanzania's sugar
factories are facing problems like obsolete equipment and lack of
capital.
</P>
<P>
Despite of the problems, he said, the future of Tanzanian sugar
industry looks bright as the government is carrying out economic
reform programs which will help restructure and expand the sugar
industry.
</P>
<P>
At present, Tanzania has four sugar factories, namely
Kilombero, Mtibwa, TPC and Kagera, with the first two having been
privatized.
</P>
<P>
Kilombero, which used to produce about 47,000 metric tons, may
produce between 50,000 and 55,000 tons of sugar this year and is
expected to turn out 80,000 tons next year. Mtibwa with current
production capacity of 32, 000 tons is also expected to increase
capacity next year, Kibonde said.
</P>
<P>
He said there are new partners which aims to inject capital in
the companies and transfer management and technology skills.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Tanzania exported 10,200 metric tons of sugar to the
European Union, earning over 3.6 million euros (about 3.88 million
U.S. dollars). This year, the EU quota for Tanzania was 12,300
tons and all of them were exported to the EU market in January
1999 earning 4.5 million euros.

JAKARTA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The 7th Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) Editors Conference Wednesday decided to
establish an ASEAN press institute.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the closing ceremony of the three-day conference
here, Antara News Agency Managing Director Parni Hadi said the
institute will serve as a training center for young ASEAN
journalists and will focus its curriculum on media management.
</P>
<P>
He said the conference also decided to maintain the ASEAN news

through the e-mail.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony on Monday, State Secretary/Minister
Akbar Tanjung expressed his concern over the role of ANEX, which
he said " appears to have made no progress".
</P>

"With the joining of two new ASEAN members (Myanmar and Laos),
it is time for ANEX not only to expend its news exchange network,
but also to discuss the ways and means to make ANEX more efficient
and effective," Akbar said in his speech.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Firms Awarded Water Projects in Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. consulting firms would design and
do feasibility studies for two major Jordanian water projects with a
total investment of 90 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Jordan Times reported Wednesday that Jordan would
pay 2.7 million dollars to Hazen &AMP; Sawyer Consultants and Montgomery
Watson for their involvement in the two projects.
</P>
<P>
The total investment of the two water projects will come from the
U.S. Agency for International Development, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Hzaen &AMP; Sawyer Consultants would design the 65-million-dollar
restructuring and rehabilitation of the water supply system of 16
zones of the greater Amman area to improve water distribution and
reduce water leaks and losses.
</P>
<P>
Nearly one third of the kingdom's 4.5 million population are living
in the greater Amman area, and accounted for 45 percent of the total
drinking water consumption.
</P>
<P>
However, over half the drinking water in the greater Amman area was
lost due to the worn-out water pipelines and theft, bringing a total
of 15 million dinars (21 million dollars) of financial losses to the
state treasury, official said.
</P>
<P>
The other U.S. firm would conduct the feasibility studies for
25-million- dollar expansion project of the main water plant in Aqaba,
a port city in the south of the country.

<HEADLINE> Australia Blasts U.S. and EU Agricultural Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Australian Federal Agriculture
Minister Mark Vaile Wednesday criticized the agricultural policies
of the United States and the European Union (E.U.), maintaining
they did not bode well for this year's new World Trade
Organization round of negotiations on agricultural trade reform.
</P>
<P>
Vaile told a Grains Council of Australia conference in western
Australia's coastal city of Perth that Australia was disappointed
with the E.U.'s trade actions and concerned about U.S. policies
which sent the wrong signal on trade reform.
</P>
<P>
"The government is ... concerned at signals coming from the
United States on the direction of U.S. agricultural policy," he
was quoted by the Australian Associated Press as telling the
conference.
</P>
<P>
These included the recent provision of a substantial assistance
package to U.S. farmers to ease the impact of falls in commodity
prices and natural disasters, and ongoing Clinton Administration
discussions on increasing the farm safety net.
</P>
<P>
"These developments do not send the right signals as we head
into a new round of agricultural trade negotiations," Vaile said.
</P>
<P>
The final outcome of the E.U. Commission's Agenda 2000
proposals for agricultural reform had been very disappointing
because proposals accepted were so watered down, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The E.U. continues to pay very generous and unnecessary
subsidies on grain exports. A past excuse was it had to compete
with U.S. export subsidies," he said.
</P>
<P>
Australia, as well as other members of Cairns Group that
groups small and medium-sized farm produce-exporting countries,
has been calling for the U.S. and E.U. to slash their subsidies on
agricultural exports.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Successfully Test-Fires Ghauri-II Missile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan successfully
test-fired its Ghauri-II ballistic missile Wednesday morning as a
tit-for-tat response to India's test-firing of Agni-II ballistic
missile last Sunday, said defense sources here.
</P>
<P>
The Ghauri-II missile was launched at 10:35 a.m. local time
(05:35 GMT) from Tilla Jogian, Jehlum, in northern Punjab
province, about 100 kilometers southeast of Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
The sources said, Ghauri-II ballistic missile launched
Wednesday, weighing 13 tons, had a range of 1,380 kilometers and
is capable of carrying either a conventional warhead or a nuclear
one of 500 to 600 kilograms with a maximum range of 2,300
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Ghauri-II can be launched on highly mobile launcher, said the
sources.
</P>
<P>
The missile hit the target at North Jawani, southwestern
Balochistan province bordering Iran after eight minutes' flight.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan informed India about the planned missile test-firing
Tuesday keeping in line with certain understanding reached between
the two countries in February.
</P>
<P>
Ghauri-II, the upgraded version of Ghauri-I, is a
surface-to-surface, solid-fueled intermediate-range ballistic
missile, which has the capability to cover the whole territory of
India.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan test-fired a Ghauri-I missile, which has a maximum
range of 1,500 kilometers with a payload of 700 kilograms, on
April 6, 1998, from the same site.
</P>
<P>
The fresh missile test-firing is a matching response by
Pakistan to India's Agni-II test-firing last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
India announced Sunday that it launched at 09:47 local time
(0417 GMT) a Agni-II ballistic missile from Wheeler island in
Balasore District, eastern state of Orissa.
</P>
<P>
Agni-II, with a maximum range of 2,500 kilometers, can hit any
target in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the Indian announcement, Pakistani Foreign
Minister Sartaj Aziz said his country will give a "befitting
response", hinting at a tit-for-tat missile test-firing by
Pakistan.

<HEADLINE> ABCs Of Macao SAR Basic Law (30) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Following is part 30 of a
question and answer series on the Basic Law of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (MSAR).
</P>
<P>
Who is eligible for a Macao Special Administrative Region
passport?
</P>
<P>
Article 139 of the Basic Law states that the Central People's
Government will authorize the MSAR Government to issue passports
of the MSAR of the People's Republic of China. MSAR passports that
are Chinese passports can only be issued in the MSAR to Chinese
citizens who are permanent residents of the MSAR and not to
Chinese citizens who reside on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
All the other residents of the MSAR need to apply for travel
documents to the MSAR Government. Both MSAR passports and travel
documents issued by its Government are valid for use by Macao
residents for travel to other regions and foreign countries. Both
types of documents must bear wording that makes it clear that the
bearer has the right to return to the MSAR.
</P>
<P>
After Macao returns to China, Chinese citizens who reside in
Macao but who hold Portuguese passports, if they are permanent
residents, can hold MSAR and People's Republic of China passports
issued by the MSAR Government can continue to hold a Portuguese
passport.
</P>
<P>
Based on Sino-Portuguese consultations, the Chinese have agreed
that the validity of the document now held by Macao residents will
be extended to December 19, 2001.
</P>
<P>
The Portuguese will also assist the Macao Government in making
it known internationally that it will be valid for two years in
Macao after it returns to China. So, even if Chinese citizens
holding this document do not have a passport or other document of
the MSAR before December 19, 2001, they can continue to travel. (

HARARE, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing strike of thousands of
the Posts and Telecommunications Corporation employees left many

The workers are demanding a 45 percent salary increase. The

<HEADLINE> Improved Shrub Expected to Benefit Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- China's efforts to plant improved
varieties of sea buckthorn are expected to bring marked profits to
farmers and increase vegetation on arid land in north China.
</P>
<P>
China has established five production bases for sea buckthorn
seedlings in five provinces and autonomous regions suffering from
soil and water erosion.
</P>
<P>
The bases will have the capacity to provide domestic markets
with 300,000 seedlings of improved strains of the shrub.
</P>
<P>
China plans to plant sea buckthorn on 66,000 ha of arid land in
north China during the year with improved strains accounting for a
third of the total number of seedlings.
</P>
<P>
Scientists from the Chinese Academy of Forestry and various
other forestry and water conservation research institutions have
developed eight strains of sea buckthorn. The new strains are
expected to provide farmers with total earning of 15,000 yuan (1,
800 U.S. dollars) per hectare.
</P>
<P>
The sea buckthorn genetic engineering project carried out over
10 years won the State Science and Technology Advancement Award in
1998, the highest science promotion prize.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Hanzhang, a researcher with the Chinese Academy of
Forestry, said the use of sea buckthorn will basically control
water and soil erosion along major rivers and play an important
future role in flood prevention.
</P>
<P>
The organge-red edible berries on the improved strains is five
times larger than berries found on wild shrubs and can be used as
raw materials for producing tonic wine, food, soft drinks and
pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
Experts note that sea buckthorn pharmaceuticals can be used to
treat stomach problems and cardiovascular diseases, in addition to
improving immunity and warding off senility.
</P>
<P>
Some 200 Chinese plants currently produce sea buckthorn fruit
products.

JI'NAN, Shandong Province, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Three-time
Olympic silver medalist Tan Liangde said here on Wednesday that he
hopes his disciples can fulfill his dream of winning an Olympic
gold medal.
</P>
<P>
"I only regret that I failed to win a gold medal in the Olympic
Games. I hope my students can make it," said Tan, a coach of the
Guandong Provincial diving team competing in the on-going National
Champion's diving tournament.
</P>
<P>
Tan was an unlucky man most of the time in his career because
he had to compete with all-time great Greg Louganis of the United
States, who beat Tan ruthlessly to second place in the 1984 and
1988 Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
But Tan said he cannot gurantee that he will produce an Olympic
champion in the near future even if he himself had been so good.

"There is a big difference between a diver and a coach," he
said, "Sometimes a good diver cannot became a good coach. But I

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- If the labeling of genetically
modified food becomes law in New Zealand the Government is likely
to set up a new agency under the Ministry of Agriculture and
Forestry (MAF) to enforce it.
</P>
<P>
According to the Evening Post, the agency may be called the
Food Assurance Authority and it will become, from July 1, the
sole agency to focus on food safety.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley has said consumers
have a right to know what is in the food they are eating. She
says the challenge is to find a workable system that gives
consumers faith in the food they eat without adding to its price.
</P>
<P>
The Wellington-based newspaper reported Wednesday, the proposed
 agency will integrate food administration and regulations,
protect public health and help ease the access of food products
to markets.
</P>
<P>
Andrew McKenzie, chief of MAF's regulatory authority, was
quoted as saying that the Food Assurance Authority, in
implementing Government policy on genetically modified food, will
work closely with the Australia-New Zealand Food Authority and
the Environmental Risk Management Authority of New Zealand.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Lifts Ban on Lake Victoria Fish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has lifted
the two- week ban on fishing and selling fish from Lake Victoria,
imposed following reports that some fishermen had used poisonous
substances to harvest fish.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Health Minister Jackson Kalweo announced Tuesday that
fish from the lake was "fit for human consumption" again, citing
that biological testing of the fish from Lake Victoria had
disapproved reports of poisoning.
</P>
<P>
The ban had brought Kenya's fishing industry on its knees,
leading to protests from legislators representing the fishing
communities along the lake, which borders Kenya, Tanzania and
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Kenya Times newspaper Wednesday quoted Kalweo as
saying that new measures to save the 250-million-U.S. dollar fish
industry from collapse will also guarantee fishermen not to use
pesticides to harvest fish.
</P>
<P>
The minister said a surveillance team comprising of members of
the provincial administration, police and other government
agencies had been set up to ensure banning the using of poisonous
chemicals in fishing.
</P>
<P>
On trawling, Kalweo said that the practise was illegal and
fishermen found using trawlers would face the punishment of the
law.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that a Kenyan government team will fly to
Brussels, Belgium for a regional meeting called by the European
Union, where Kenyan officials are expected to brief the Europeans
of the latest developments over the fishing issue.
</P>
<P>
On March 30, the EU announced a total ban on fresh and frozen
fish imports from Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, following reports
claiming that unscrupulous fishermen have been using insecticides
to poison fish, posing threats to food health.
</P>
<P>
The ban has dealt a heavy blow to the three east African
countries as Kenya earns some 91 million dollars annually from the
fish industry while Tanzania earns 85.6 million and Uganda earns
some 70 million dollars from the sector.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Successfully Test-fires Ghauri-II Missile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan successfully
test-fired a Ghauri-II (HAFT-V) ballistic missile Wednesday
morning, a press release just issued by the Foreign Ministry said
here.
</P>
<P>
The Ghauri-II missile was launched at 10:45 a.m. local time
(05:45 GMT) from Tilla Jogian, Jehlum, in northern Punjab
province, about 100 kilometers southeast of Islamabad, Captain
Muhammad Alam from the Kahuta Research Laboratory, which carried
out the flight test, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
According to Captain Alam, the missile hit the target at North
Jawani, southwestern Balochistan province bordering Iran after 14
minutes' flight with a range of 1,380 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Laboratory said, Ghauri-II ballistic missile
launched Wednesday, weighted 13 tons and is capable of carrying a
nuclear or conventional warhead of 500 to 600 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
The maximum range of Ghauri-II, which can be fired on high
mobile launcher, could be extended to about 2,300 kilometers, said
the sources.
</P>
<P>
The test is "part of the research and development of Pakistan's
indigenous missile program" which is "an essential element of our
policy of maintaining deterrence in the interest of our security",
said a press release just released by Pakistani Foreign Office.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan informed India about the planned missile test-firing
Tuesday, keeping in line with certain understanding reached at
Lahore between the two countries in February.
</P>
<P>
Ghauri-II, the upgraded version of Ghauri-I, is a
surface-to-surface, solid-fueled intermediate-range ballistic
missile, which has the capability to cover the whole territory of
India.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan test-fired a Ghauri-I missile, which has a maximum
range of 1,500 kilometers with a payload of 700 kilograms, on
April 6, 1998, from the same site.
</P>
<P>
The fresh missile test-firing is a matching response by
Pakistan to India's Agni-II test-firing last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
India announced Sunday that it launched at 09:47 local time
(0417 GMT) a Agni-II ballistic missile from Wheeler island in
Balasore District, eastern state of Orissa.
</P>
<P>
Agni-II, with a maximum range of 2,500 kilometers, can hit any
target in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the Indian announcement, Pakistani Foreign
Minister Sartaj Aziz said his country will give a "befitting
response", hinting at a tit-for-tat missile test-firing by
Pakistan.

<HEADLINE> Hawking Banned at Taxi Parks in Ugandan Capital to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan capital city council
has banned hawking at the new and old taxi parks in a move to
check the kind of bomb blasts that rocked Kampala last weekend.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made during a two-day closed security meeting
chaired by Resident District Commissioner Serapio Karashani at the
city council, the Monitor daily reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hawking and street trading are blamed for the disastrous bomb
blasts over the weekend in which at least four people were killed
and many others injured.
</P>
<P>
The kiosk owners are requested to remove their shops by
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, all congested places in the city are saturated with
uniformed police and plain clothed security operatives.
</P>
<P>
Bob Ngobi, police spokesman, was quoted as saying that police
are being deployed at potential targets and information is being
gathered to net the suspects who are still at large.
</P>
<P>
Another report said that a Zimbabwean man, who was alleged to
have funded the bombers, was arrested here Monday.
</P>
<P>
A security officer said that preliminary inquiries indicate
this man is a Zimbabwean but he carries a Ugandan passport.
</P>
<P>
Police records indicate that 43 people have so far been killed
and 156 injured in different places in Uganda since 1997.
</P>
<P>
About 89.5 percent of the incidents of terrorist-related
explosions have happened in Kampala. The remaining 10.5 percent
took place in the rest of the country, especially southwestern
Uganda.

<HEADLINE> Light Industry Undergoing Major Restructuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- China's light industry is
undergoing major restructuring with the focus on eight industries
within the overall sector, sources from State Administration of
Light Industry (SALI) said.
</P>
<P>
It will include the upgrading of technologies, which will last
three or five years depending on the progress made, and later
outdated equipment will be phased out enabling such enterprises to
achieve international standards.
</P>
<P>
The eight include paper-making, household electrical appliances,
plastics, chemicals, leather, ceramics, and lighting equipment.
</P>
<P>
According to an official with the SALI, the total output value
of the above-mentioned industries accounts for 80 percent of the
total sector, and much of their output takes the lead in the
international market.
</P>
<P>
She added that they are the major profit-earners in terms of
exports, and their market demand and sales are still rising.
</P>
<P>
This year China has introduced a package of policies in support
of these industries.
</P>
<P>
SALI urges relevant associations to take concrete measures to
improve the product quality and technologies and says that
brandname enterprises will be given incentives to set up factories
abroad and establish sales networks.
</P>
<P>
Hopefully, the sector will have 100 world famous enterprises
each with an annual sales volume of 2 billion yuan (240 million US
dollars) within three years.

NEW YORK, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Michelle Kwan eased to a
comfortable win but still failed to prevent the United States
squad from losing to the World Team led by a field of Russian
elite skaters in the Hershey's Kisses Pro-Am figure skating event
Tuesday night at Binghamton, New York.
</P>
<P>
Kwan was awarded two perfect marks for presentation as she beat
Maria Butyrskaya in the final matchup of the team competition,
sweetly revenging her loss to the Russian in the defence of the
world championships singles title in Helsinki last month.
</P>
<P>
But the American team was too far behind for Kwan's win to make
a difference and lost to the World team 14-13.
</P>
<P>
Maia Usova and Yevgeny Platov and the Olympic gold medalists
Oksana Kazakova and Artur Dmitriev led the World Team to a clean
win over the U.S. squad in both pairs and ice dancing competition.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. team stamped their strength mainly in the women's
singles competition where beside the comfortable win by Kwan,
Sarah Hughes, 13, defeated two-time Olympic champion Katarina Witt
of Germany and 1992 Olympic gold medalist Yamaguchi outclass Yuka
Sato of Japan.

<HEADLINE> New Way Out for Troubled State Enterprises: Economist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- China's state-owned enterprises,
half of which are suffering losses, may find their way out by
developing in certain areas, according to a renowned economist.
</P>
<P>
Dong Furen, vice chairman of the Financial and Economic
Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference, was quoted by China Youth Daily
as saying that troubled state enterprises may acquire new momentum
by focusing on some fields such as public facilities.
</P>
<P>
It may be more suitable for state enterprises to engage in
industries requiring larger investments and slower returns,
according to Dong.
</P>
<P>
These include policy-oriented institutions such as policy banks,
and grain-reserve companies, communications and transportation
facilities, infrastructure construction groups, and high-tech
firms with high risks.
</P>
<P>
While engaging in public welfare industries, state enterprises,
particularly large and medium-sized ones, may avoid some of the
competition from private firms and small and medium-sized
companies which are more flexible in catering to the market, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Australian Economy Likely to Slow Over Next Year: Treasurer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Australian federal Treasurer
Peter Costello Wednesday said he believed Australia's growth rate
would slow over the next year.
</P>
<P>
The Australian stock market had been closing at all-time
records day after day, Costello said in an interview with a
Melbourne-based radio 3AW.
</P>
<P>
But he said he expected Australian growth would slow this year.
</P>
<P>
"We're growing at four and three quarter percent, which is the
fastest growth in the developed world".
</P>
<P>
"We're outstripping the United States, all of Asia, all of
Europe".
</P>
<P>
"I don't think growth will be up to those four and five percent
levels. I think there'll be a slowing.
</P>
<P>
"But if the slowing comes back to two to three percent, that'll
be a fantastic outcome.
</P>
<P>
"Because if the Australian economy slows to two to three
percent, that means we're slowing to a growth rate in front of
Britain, France, Germany, Japan - nearly all of the developed
world, which would be a terrific outcome".
</P>
<P>
"I think what's going to be driving the world economy over the
next year is obviously the U.S. growth," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The world stock markets are stronger than they've ever been."
</P>
<P>
But the pace of Asian economy, particularly Japan, would be a
major factor in the world economy over the next couple of years,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"Japan has had, I think, five quarters of negative growth and
there is not any sign of recovery of the Japanese economy."
</P>
<P>
The situation in Japan would dictate world economic prospects
for some time, Costello said.
</P>
<P>
The treasurer, who is widely regarded as favorite to replace
Prime Minister John Howard as leader of the ruling Liberal Party
for the next federal election expected in 2001, is going to unveil
the federal budget on May 11 for the next fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> Wang Tianling Wins Title at China Diving Champion's Tourney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JI'NAN, Shandong Province, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Wang Tianling
won the men's one-meter springboard diving title on the opening
day of the National Champion's Tournament here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Wang, placed second in the edition last year in Chengdu,
Sichuan Province, led the field of 30 divers all the way and took
the win comfortably by collecting 391.50 points. Wang Feng
finished second with 359.34 and Xu Hao third with 357.
</P>
<P>
Wang Tianling, 22, who has dominated the one-meter diving since
1989, looked very confident throughout the competition and was
rarely threatened.
</P>
<P>
He grabbed two gold medals in the one-meter and three-meter
springboard events in the Naitonal Youth Games in 1989 and won the
one-meter title in the 1992 China Cup international tournament.
</P>
<P>
But his first major title came from the synchronized diving in
the 1993 World Cup with teammate Yu Zhuocheng. He took the three-
meter event in the 1994 Asian Games in Hiroshima, Japan.
</P>
<P>
He won the one-meter event in style at the National Games in
Shanghai in 1997. But plagued with an serious injury, he failed to
qualify for the Bangkok Asian Games last December.
</P>
<P>
The National Champion's Tournament, which will run until Sunday,
drew a group of world's most glittering stars including triple
Olympic champion Fu Mingxia, 1992 platform Olympic gold medallist
Sun Shuwei, world champion and Olympic silver medallist Yu
Zhuocheng and Olympic bronze winner Xiao Hailiang.

WUHAN, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Ruins of an ancient tribe that
thrived around 5,000 years ago have been found in central China's
Hubei Province in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
Covering an area of 200,000 square meters, the site is
surrounded by city walls made of earth, with a well-preserved
western wall three to five meters high, 40 meters thick at the
base, and 13 to 14 meters at the top. A ditch 2.5 meters deep and
59 meters wide runs around the ancient city.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists uncovered a number of rather large earthen houses
built and arranged as proficient structures. One of the houses has
four rectangular rooms standing in a row, each occupying 83 square
meters. The room windows are 0.9 meters high and 0.8 meters wide
facing south.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists say that this find provides valuable information
about the people who lived there more than 5,000 years ago, and
indicates that they pooled their manpower and materials for public
construction.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Successfully Test-Fires Ghauri-II Missile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan successfully
test-fired a Ghauri-II ballistic missile Wednesday morning as a
tit-for-tat response to India's test-firing of Agni-II ballistic
missile test-firing last Sunday, said defense sources here.
</P>
<P>
The Ghauri-II missile was launched at 10:35 a.m. local time
(05:35 GMT) from Tilla Jogian, Jehlum in northern Punjab province,
about 100 kilometers southeast of Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
The sources said, Ghauri-II ballistic missile launched
Wednesday, weighing 13 tons, had a range of 1,380 kilometers and
is capable of carrying either a conventional warhead or a nuclear
one of 500 to 600 kilometers with a maximum range of 2,300
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Ghauri-II can be launched on highly mobile launcher, said the
sources.
</P>
<P>
The missile hit the target at North Jawani, southwestern
Balochistan province bordering Iran after eight minutes' flight.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan informed India about the planned missile test-firing
Tuesday keeping in line with certain understanding reached between
the two countries in February.
</P>
<P>
Ghauri-II, the upgraded version of Ghauri-I, is a
surface-to-surface, solid-fueled intermediate-range ballistic
missile, which has the capability to cover the whole territory of
India.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan test-fired a Ghauri-I missile, which has a maximum
range of 1,500 kilometers with a payload of 700 kilograms, on
April 6, 1998 from the same site.
</P>
<P>
The fresh missile test-firing is a matching response by
Pakistan to India's Agni-II test-firing last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the Sunday test carried out at a new site in the
eastern Indian state of Orissa, Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj
Aziz said his country will give a "befitting response", hinting at
a tit-for-tat missile test-fire by Pakistan.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji
expressed his hope that an agreement on China's entry into the
World Trade Organization (WTO) will be reached soon.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a major speech here Tuesday, Premier Zhu said that
during his visit to the United States, he and U.S. President Bill
Clinton have held "friendly and frank" talks, which produced "
constructive results."
</P>
<P>
"We have made tremendous progress (during our talks) on China's
entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO)," Zhu said at a
dinner meeting co-sponsored by the Economic Club of New York and
the U.S.- China Business Council, and participated in about 1,500
members of the two organizations.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are getting close to complete the talks on
China's accession to the WTO, said Premier Zhu, who described that
"99 percent" of the job has been done.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu is on an official visit to the United States at the
invitation of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
He is leaving for Boston on Wednesday, the sixth leg of his U.S.
trip, after visiting Los Angeles, Washington, Denver, Chicago and
New York.
</P>
<P>
During a telephone conversation on Tuesday afternoon, President
Clinton and Premier Zhu Rongji agreed that both sides should move
intensively on negotiations towards the resolution of the
remaining issues in the talks on China's accession to the WTO.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have agreed to continue negotiations before
the end of this month in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"We hope an agreement will be reached soon," Zhu said. "It
serves not only the interests of China, but also those of the
United States."
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu said that developing friendly relations with China
is a bipartisan policy of the Republic and Democratic parties.
</P>
<P>
China and the United States established constructive strategic
partnership after the exchange of successful visits by President
Jiang Zemin and President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Such a relationship not only serves the interests of the
peoples of the two countries, but also is conducive to world peace,
Zhu noted.
</P>
<P>
Describing the existing "minor difficulties" in the bilateral
relations as "a small episode in the long river of history," Zhu
Rongji expressed his hope that "the small cloud will disperse and
bright sunshine will follow."

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Export Earnings May Fall Short of Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The poor performance of
Bangladesh's export sector during the first seven month of the
current fiscal year has signaled that the country may not be able
to achieve its export target of 5.63 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The current trend shows export earnings may hit 5-billion
dollar mark by the end of the current fiscal (between July 1998
and June 1999)," The Independent daily newspaper on Wednesday
quoted on an official of the Export Promotion Bureau as saying.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that the country fetched 2.98 billion
dollars during the July-January period, trailing the target of
3.28 billion dollars by 9 percent, and 1 percent less than the
figure of the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Primary commodity exports slumped in both volume and value, by
14 percent and 18 percent respectively, while industrial exports
marked a slight upturn.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Ministry earlier this year scaled down the export
target from 5.8 billion dollars to 5.63 billion dollars for the
present fiscal year, as the country's exports suffered a major
setback during a severe flood during July-September in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the country lost 350 million to 500 million
dollars in exports during the three-month-long flood.
</P>
<P>
A total of 2.75 billion dollars are expected from the
ready-made garment sector this fiscal, which accounts for 49
percent of the total projected earnings.
</P>
<P>
The country's export earnings stood at 5.16 billion dollars
during the previous fiscal, about 2.81 percent higher than the
targeted 5.02 billion dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Richard Krajicek of the Netherlands
eased ahead after his compatriot John van Lottum was forced to
retire following just four games for a right shoulder injury on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Krajicek, the number one seed, led 3-1 when van Lottum shook
his hand, saying that he had to give up the match as his shoulder
injury, which he picked up at the Salem Open in Hong Kong last
week, recurred.
</P>
<P>
Krajicek will meet in the quarter-finals German number 16 seed
David Prinosil who routed Cecil Mamiit of the United States 6-2,
6-3 in the second round.
</P>
<P>
Earlier local favorite Michael Chang suffered an early exit as
he was knocked out by Jens Knippschild of Germany in straight sets.
</P>
<P>
Chang, the American ninth seed, fell victim to an array of the
German's dangerous forehand as he went down 3-6, 4-6, becoming the
biggest casualty of the tournament so far.
</P>
<P>
In other action, South African number seven seed Wayne Ferreira
disposed of Dennis van Scheppingen of the Netherlands 7-6 (7-2), 6-
3 while number 10 seed Czech Daniel Vacek was upset by German Lars

<HEADLINE> ABCs Of Macao SAR Basic Law (29) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Following is part 29 of a
question and answer series on the Basic Law of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (MSAR).
</P>
<P>
Will Macao's residents have freedom of speech and freedom of
the press after Macao returns to China?
</P>
<P>
Article 27 of the Basic Law says that Macao's residents will
have freedom of speech and freedom of the press, irrespective of
their nationality.
</P>
<P>
Local and non-local newspapers and Chinese, English, and
Portuguese newspapers are published in Macao. Small as it is,
Macao has a long publishing history and has eight Chinese dailies,
three Portuguese dailies, five Chinese weeklies, and two
Portuguese weeklies providing up-to-date and an extensive
information about political, economic, cultural and other
developments and playing a key role in supervising the local
government.
</P>
<P>
After Macao returns to China, Portuguese newspapers there can
continue to circulate and Macao residents of Portuguese descent
can publish new Portuguese newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Article 27 says that Macao residents not only have freedom of
speech and freedom of the press, but also freedom to associate,
assemble, join processions, and demonstrate.
</P>
<P>
But rights and obligations always go hand in hand. In
exercising the rights and freedoms under the law, Macao residents
have the obligation to abide by the law. Macao has a law on the
right of assembly and the right to demonstrate but, in the
interest of public order, the law gives the necessary limits to
this right.
</P>
<P>
After Macao returns to China, Macao residents have to obey the
legal provisions on exercising the right of assembly, the right to
join processions, and to demonstrate.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Youngsters Develop Creativity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey of more than 2,
000 middle school and university students in Hong Kong revealed
that vast majority of respondents pay close attention to
developing creativity.
</P>
<P>
The survey, sponsored by the Hong Kong New Generation Cultural
Association, found that 60.5 percent of respondents agreed that
creativity is closely linked with human civilization and the
nation's future and destiny.
</P>
<P>
Some 10.5 percent respondents expressed a lack of interest in
creativity, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
Thomas So Chi Ki, executive director of the association, said
yesterday that 60.7 percent of respondents agreed that invention
competitions help to improve the ability of students to observe,
analyze and solve problems
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that 62 percent respondents agreed that good
scores on examinations fail to indicate levels of creativity. More
than half of respondents said they possess strong self-confidence,
curiosity and determination needed to spark creativity.
</P>
<P>
However, Hong Kong youngsters are somewhat affected by
stereotyped thinking and are likely to exhibit blind respect for
authority, according to So Chi Ki.
</P>
<P>
He noted that similar surveys will be conducted in Hong Kong
every two years to determine the level of creativity. He added
that experts will advise the government on appropriate educational
policies.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Successfully Test-Fires Ghauri-II Missile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan successfully
test-fired a Ghauri-II ballistic missile Wednesday morning as a
tit-for-tat response to India's test-firing of Agni-II ballistic
missile test-firing last Sunday, said defense sources here.
</P>
<P>
The Ghauri-II missile was launched at 10:35 a.m. local time
(05:35 GMT) from Tilla Jogian, Jehlum, in northern Punjab
province, about 100 kilometers southeast of Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
The sources said, Ghauri-II ballistic missile launched
Wednesday, weighing 13 tons, had a range of 1,380 kilometers and
is capable of carrying either a conventional warhead or a nuclear
one of 500 to 600 kilograms with a maximum range of 2,300
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Ghauri-II can be launched on highly mobile launcher, said the
sources.
</P>
<P>
The missile hit the target at North Jawani, southwestern
Balochistan province bordering Iran after eight minutes' flight.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan informed India about the planned missile test-firing
Tuesday keeping in line with certain understanding reached between
the two countries in February.
</P>
<P>
Ghauri-II, the upgraded version of Ghauri-I, is a
surface-to-surface, solid-fueled intermediate-range ballistic
missile, which has the capability to cover the whole territory of
India.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan test-fired a Ghauri-I missile, which has a maximum
range of 1,500 kilometers with a payload of 700 kilograms, on
April 6, 1998, from the same site.
</P>
<P>
The fresh missile test-firing is a matching response by
Pakistan to India's Agni-II test-firing last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
India announced Sunday that it launched at 09:47 local time
(0417 GST) a Agni-II ballistic missile from Wheeler island in
Balasore District, eastern state of Orissa.
</P>
<P>
Agni-II, with a maximum range of 2,500 kilometers, can hit any
target in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the Indian announcement, Pakistani Foreign
Minister Sartaj Aziz said his country will give a "befitting
response", hinting at a tit-for-tat missile test-fire by Pakistan.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's former Deputy
Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim was Wednesday sentenced to six years'
imprisonment by the High court here on four corruption charges
against him.
</P>
<P>
Following is a chronology of major events relating to Anwar's
case.
</P>
<P>
September 2, 1998: Anwar, 51, was removed from his cabinet
posts as deputy prime minister and finance minister.
</P>
<P>
September 3, 1998: Anwar was expelled from United Malays
National Organization (UMNO) by its supreme council after he
refused to resign as deputy president.
</P>
<P>
Police filed affidavits at the High Court, alleging Anwar
committed sexual offenses and treason.
</P>
<P>
September 11, 1998: Anwar began a series of public rallies
around the country demanding reform and defending himself.
</P>
<P>
September 19, 1998: Anwar's adopted brother Sukma Sasmitaat
Madja and his former speech writer Munawar Anees Ahmad were
sentenced to six months' imprisonment each after they pleaded
guilty to allowing Anwar to sodomize them.
</P>
<P>
September 20, 1998: Anwar was arrested at his house here under
the Internal Security Act after he led a march in Dataran Merdeka
(Independence Square), and was detained at a lock-up at the police
headquarters in Kuala Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
September 29, 1998: Anwar appeared in court for the first time
after his arrest with a black eye and pleaded not guilty to five
corruption and four sodomy charges. Anwar told a Sessions Court
judge that the police beat him unconscious and denied him medical
attention.
</P>
<P>
September 30, 1998: Anwar pleaded not guilty to an additional
sodomy charge at Petaling Jaya Sessions Court.
</P>
<P>
October 5, 1998: Anwar arrived in Kuala Lumpur High Court

after he was no longer detained under the Internal Security Act.

application to disqualify him from continuing to hear the case,
saying it was wrong in law.
</P>

Anwar while the prosecution said defense witnesses failed to
corroborate Anwar's testimony and his evidence has strengthened
its case. Trial ended.

HARARE, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government will
spend 40 million Zimbabwean dollars (over one million U.S.
dollars) funding a task force set up to coordinate activities
aimed at resolving the Year 2000 computer compliance problem.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Higher Education and Technology Ignatius Chombo

participation of key sectors such as health, energy, transport,
finance, telecommunications and water which were important for the
well being of any society, the daily Herald reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, the task force chairman Elliot Zwangobani said more
than 300 million Zimbabwean dollars (7.5 million U.S. dollars)
would be required to bring the key sectors into compliance.
</P>
<P>
The chairman said It was difficult to give the level of
preparedness nationwide and his task force was therefore
concentrating on key sectors only.
</P>
<P>
He said the task force was working hard to ensure that there
would not be major disruptions in the delivery of services.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Needs to Import Half Million Tons of Cereals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Ghana needs to import 500,000
tons of cereals, mostly wheat and rice to supplement its
requirement this year, the Ghana News Agency Wednesday quoted the
U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) as saying.
</P>
<P>
Although the overall food supply situation in Ghana is good
following the harvest of the main crops in 1998, the prevailing
seasonally droughts may hamper production in the west African
country, a FAO's publication on global food information said.
</P>
<P>
According to the publication, Ghana's aggregate cereal
production in 1998 was estimated at 1.78 million tons which was
slightly above that in 1997.
</P>
<P>
It also said that the generally favorable conditions in
Senegal, Mauritania, Mali, Niger and Chad in 1998 brought in a
record crop.
</P>
<P>
Improved security and favorable weather resulted in a good
cereal harvest in Liberia, but in neighboring Sierra Leone, the
1998 crop production was well below average and food supply
remains critical in many areas.
</P>
<P>
However, the FAO pointed out that civil strife, drought and
hurricanes were hampering food production in many countries.
</P>
<P>
Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Somalia are among
the countries where civil wars have affected food production,
while drought has pinned down output in Chile, Cuba and Jordan.

<HEADLINE> Anwar Sentenced to 6 years' Jail, But to Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian former Deputy
Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim was found guilty and sentenced to six
years' jail by the High Court here Wednesday on four corruption
charges against him, but his lawyers said they would appeal
against the sentence immediately.
</P>
<P>
Anwar was sentenced to six years' imprisonment on each of the
four charges, but the sentence would run concurrently from
Wednesday as ruled by Justice Augustine Paul.
</P>
<P>
In his judgment, Justice Augustine Paul said: "It is my
considered judgment having meticulously considered the law and
the facts and overall basis, I found the prosecution has proved
its case beyond reasonable doubt. I found the accused guilty as
charged."
</P>
<P>
Anwar's lawyers told reporters outside the court that they were
going to appeal against the conviction and sentence. "We are going
to file an appeal immediately," a lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
The judge disallowed bail pending appeal.
</P>
<P>
Outside the court and in the surrounding areas, security was
tight with heavy police contingents deployed.
</P>
<P>
Anwar's supporters demonstrated on streets close to the court
building, but without untoward incidents.
</P>
<P>
The judgment came after 77 days of Anwar's corruption trial on
four charges of corrupt practice for allegedly abusing his
positions as deputy prime minister and finance minister to
interfere in police investigations into allegations of sexual
misconduct against him.
</P>
<P>
Anwar is charged under the Section 2(1) of the Emergency
(Essential Powers) Ordinance 1970 which carries a maximum 14
years' imprisonment or a maximum fine of 20,000 ringgit (5,263
U.S. dollars), or both, upon conviction.
</P>
<P>
Anwar's corruption trial, which began on November 2 last year
exactly two months after he was sacked amid allegations of sexual
misconduct, made it the longest criminal trial in Malaysian legal
history.
</P>
<P>
During the trial, the judge listened to a total of 46 witnesses
-- 23 from the prosecution and 22 from the defense, and one known
as a court witness -- as well as the arguments from both sides.
</P>
<P>
Anwar took the stand as the first defense witness on February
8, claiming he was a victim of a political conspiracy among the
top leaders of the country to topple him.
</P>
<P>
The court, however, ruled out the political conspiracy theory,
only allowing the defense to raise police conspiracy in the trial.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution contended that Anwar ordered two senior police
officers to obtain retraction letters from Ummi Hafilda Ali and
Azizan Abu Bakar who made allegations about his (Anwar's) sexual
misconduct to the Prime Minister (Mahathir Mohamad).
</P>
<P>
The trial saw one of Anwar's nine lawyers, Zainur Zakaria,
sentenced to three months' jail after he was found guilty of
contempt of court on December 1 last year after the counsel
refused to apologize for an application he filed on behalf of
Anwar, seeking to prevent two senior deputy public prosecutors
from continuing to be involved in the case.
</P>
<P>
Zainur was never seen sitting with his colleagues throughout
the trial after he was sentenced.
</P>
<P>
During the trial, Anwar filed the notice of motion at the High
Court Criminal Division, supported by his affidavit, seeking to
disqualify Justice Augustine Paul from hearing his case as he
believed he had not been given a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
Attorney-General Mohtar Abdullah, who led the prosecution team,
said the application to disqualify the judge was not only
discourteous but also contemptuous.
</P>
<P>
Justice Augustine Paul said it was clear in law that one judge
from the High Court had no power to disqualify another High Court
judge.
</P>
<P>
The Anwar's trial drew a large crowd who were willing to queue
all night long in order to get into the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the trial, security was the heaviest in Malaysian
legal history as Anwar's supporters held unprecedented street
protests since his arrest on September 20 last year.

ISLAMABAD, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan successfully
test-fired a Ghauri-II ballistic missile Wednesday morning as a
tit-for-tat response to India's test-firing of its Agni-II
ballistic missile on Sunday, said official sources.
</P>
<P>
The Ghauri-II missile was launched at 10:35 a.m. local time
(0535 GMT) from Tilla Jogian, Jehlum in northern Punjab province,
about 100 kilometers southeast of Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the Ghauri-II ballistic missile launched
Wednesday had a range of 1,380 kilometers, and is capable of
carrying a nuclear warhead with a maximum range of 2,300
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The missile hit the target at North Jawani, southwestern
Balochistan province bordering Iran after eight minutes' flight.
</P>
<P>
Ghauri-II, an upgraded version of Ghauri-I, is a
surface-to-surface, solid-fueled intermediate-range ballistic
missile, which has the capability to cover the whole territory of
India, experts say.
</P>
<P>
The fresh missile test-firing is described here as a "matching
response" by Pakistan to India's Agni-II test-firing on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> East, West China Highlight Transfer of Technological Results (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China has emphasized the coordinated development of different
regions in recent years, with key development moving away from
coastal areas and toward the central and western parts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Central and western China have advantages in terms of land,
resources, and labor force, as well as a market with great
potential, making these areas very attractive for eastern
investors, said Lu Sanyu, a professor at Xi'an Jiaotong University.
</P>
<P>
Lu pointed out that, as a matter of fact, a large unified
market has already emerged in China, breaking down regional
barriers, and many areas have begun to share technology and
resources.
</P>
<P>
He cited four contracts that were signed at the fair for the
transfer of a laser model-making technology, invented by Professor
Lu Bingheng of Xi'an Jiaotong University, to Shenzhen, Chongqing,
Yunnan and Guizhou, involving seven million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Entrepreneurs from eastern and western China exchanged ideas
and probed new channels for scientific and technological
cooperation at the fair.
</P>
<P>
Sun Haiying, director of the Shaanxi provincial scientific and
technological department, suggested setting up companies jointly
by enterprises and scientific and technological institutions, in
an effort to optimize the distribution of technology and assets.
</P>
<P>
Technological cooperation will make it possible for
economically less-advantaged western areas to catch up to their
eastern counterparts, he noted.

TOKYO, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Michael Chang disappointed the
local crowds as he suffered an early exit at the second round of
the Japan Open tennis tournament, knocked out by Jens Knippschild
of Germany in straight sets on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chang, the American ninth seed, fell victim to an array of the
German's dangerous forehand as he went down 3-6, 4-6, becoming the
biggest casualty of the tournament so far.
</P>
<P>
Knippschild, ranked 101th, broke Chang's service twice in a row
to lead 4-1 in the first set and again jumped ahead 3-0 in the
second, hitting numerous forehand winners which found no reply.
</P>
<P>
Chang broke back in the sixth game of the first set and fifth
game of the second, but the German kept his momentum to win
another break to finish off both sets against a struggling Chang.
</P>

KUALA LUMPUR, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian former Deputy
Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim was found guilty and sentenced to six
years' jail by the High Court here Wednesday on all four
corruption charges against him.
</P>
<P>
Anwar was sentenced to six years' imprisonment on each of the
four charges, but the sentence runs concurrently.

</P>
<P>
Anwar's lawyer Pawancheek Marican told reporters outside the

effect from Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Marican said the heavy sentence is "because the position held
by Anwar is number two in the country.
</P>
<P>
"Anwar appeared shocked on hearing the judgment," Marican said.
</P>
<P>
Anwar's another lawyer told reporters: "We are going to file an

<HEADLINE> China-U.S. Talks on China's Entry to WTO Almost Complete: Chinese Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Premier Zhu
Rongji said here Tuesday that China and the United States have
almost completed negotiations on China's entry into the World
Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
"I had friendly and frank talks with U.S. President Bill
Clinton and the talks achieved constructive results, especially on
China's entry into the WTO," Zhu said at a dinner co-sponsored by
the Economic Club of New York and the U.S.-China Business Council.
</P>
<P>
In his view, Zhu said, 99 percent of the work in the
negotiations between the two countries on China's access to the
WTO has completed.
</P>
<P>
The American people are friendly to the Chinese people and they
favor Sino-U.S. friendship and China's entry to the WTO, he said
at the dinner which was attended by 1,500 people.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier said he talked with Clinton on the
telephone this afternoon. During the conversion, he said, they
agreed that both sides should move intensively on negotiations
towards resolution of remaining issues at the talks on China's
access to the WTO.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed that the two countries will continue
negotiations in Beijing by the end of this month, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that China and the United States will reach the final
agreement on China's access to the world trade body in the near
future," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that China's entry into the WTO is not only favorable
to China itself, but even more favorable to the United States.
</P>
<P>
It has been 13 years since the negotiations began on China's
resumption of the General Agreement on Trade and Tariff (GATT)
membership and later its access to the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Zhu arrived in the United States on April 6 for an eight-day
official visit to the country, the first by a Chinese premier in
15 years.

<HEADLINE> Motorola First-Quarter Net Earnings Rise 20 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Motorola Inc., one of the
world largest wireless phone and computer chip makers, said
Tuesday that its first-quarter profit rose 20.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
A report from the company said earnings rose to 171 million U.S.
dollars in the first quarter in 1999, up from 142 million dollars
for the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Motorola said its revenue for the quarter also rose 5 percent
to 7.2 billion dollars from 6.9 billion a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
"Operating results reflect increasing market share in digital
wireless telephones. The increase stems from the success of new
products, and continuing improvements in the semiconductor
business, which returned to profitability," said Robert Growney,
chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Motorola took a 1.9 billion dollar restructuring
charge, leading to an annual loss of nearly one billion dollars.
The reorganization included an 18,000 dollar reduction in
Motorola's work force of 150,000.
</P>
<P>
The semiconductor unit is the second most important source of
Motorola's revenues, behind wireless phones. The chip unit posted
a first-quarter operating profit of 47 million dollars, compared
with last year's operating loss of 58 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Christopher Galvin, Motorola's chief executive officer,
credited the company's new customer-focused strategy, cost-cutting
and improvements in the communications and computer chip areas for
improved results.
</P>
<P>
He said weak economic conditions in some regions of the world
would continue to affect growth, but the sales and profit momentum
from the first quarter was likely to continue into the second
quarter of 1999.

<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 13 (Xinhua) -- International Paper Co., the
world's largest forest and paper company, said Tuesday that its
earnings fell 70 percent in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
A report from the company, which makes products ranging from
printing paper and cartons to lumber and chemicals, said its
profits fell to 44 million U.S. dollars in the quarter, from 75
million dollars in the same period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The company reported a slight increase in revenues to five
billion dollars from 4.9 billion dollars in the same quarter last
year due to improvements in several businesses, including wood
products, food services and container board.
</P>
<P>
"Overall, business has clearly improved, and we are optimistic
that the price increases we announced will be fully implemented
during the second quarter," said John Dillion, chairman and chief
executive officer of the company.
</P>
<P>
He said that prices on several key products had started to move
up in the United States, and that some of the major Asian markets
are beginning to recover from the economic problems of last year.
</P>
<P>
But he voiced a concern for the development weakness in
European economies.

BELGRADE, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav army on Tuesday
denied reports by some foreign news agencies that Serb forces had
entered a northern village of Albania.
</P>
<P>
"These reports are absolutely absurd and groundless," said a
statement released by the information bureau of the supreme
command of the Yugoslav armed forces.
</P>
<P>
"Yugoslav frontier forces will resolutely stop any enemy
incursion. We do not want others' territory, but no one would be
allowed to occupy our territory."
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav Foreign Ministry spokesman Nebojsa Vujovic also denied
the accusations.
</P>
<P>
"Those accusations are absolutely false. Yugoslav troops did
not enter Albania. There are no Serbian troops in Albania," he
said.

In Albania, the national security and defense council held an

The council has decided to "firmly respond with fire to any

<P>
COLOMBO, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga Wednesday appealed for the dawn of peace and unity in
her ethnic conflict-torn country which is celebrating the Sinhala
and Tamil New Year.
</P>
<P>
The majority Sinhalese and the minority Tamils celebrate their
common New Year on Wednesday, the only occasion the two peoples
join to mark a traditional event.
</P>
<P>
In a message to mark the Sri Lanka traditional New Year,
President Kumaratunga said the New Year is not only a "golden
thread" that binds together all sections of society but also a
festival that portrays unity and coexistence.
</P>
<P>
She said the New Year festival which is a symbol of unity
"brings to us the message of prosperity along with new hopes and
aspirations."
</P>
<P>
"The foremost hope and aspiration of us all on this day that we
visualize the dawn of peace is to build a prosperous Sri Lanka by
overcoming all social, economic and political challenges before
us," said Kumaratunga.
</P>
<P>
She said there is no other opportunity more suitable than this
to promote national unity and strengthen it by specially promoting
mutual friendship, goodwill, understanding and respect between the
Sinhala and Tamil people.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has long been plagued by conflicts between the
Sinhalese and Tamils, the two largest ethnic groups in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam rebels have been waging a
war against the Sri Lankan government for a separate Tamil
homeland in the north and east of the country since 1983.

<HEADLINE> China to Adjust Market Control of Major Consumer Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- China is adjusting its market
control policies of major consumer goods by giving more emphasis
to the opening-up of the country's market, according to the State
Administration of Internal Trade.
</P>
<P>
Previously, the sufficient supply of major consumer goods was
stressed, but under the current buyer's market situation, equal
attention should be given to the coordination and opening-up of
the domestic market, said an official of the administration.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that the market supply of meat, vegetables, sugar
and other major products has been more than enough in recent years,
and prices for these goods have continued to drop.
</P>
<P>
To strengthen market supervision, the administration plans to
establish a computer network to release the latest information on
major goods and open "green passageways" for inter-city
transportation of meat and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
Management of stored goods will also be enhanced in accordance
with market demand and the wholesale market for farm produces will
also be further developed, according to sources at the
administration.

<HEADLINE> Intel Profits Rise 57 Percent in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Intel Corporation, the
world's largest manufacturer of microprocessor computer chips,
Tuesday reported a 57-percent surge in the first quarter net
income compared with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
A report from the Santa Clara, California-based Intel said it
earned two billion U.S. dollars in the first quater which ended on
March 27, up from a profit of 1.27 billion dollars during the same
quarter a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Intel said the increase in profits was the result of strong
demand for its new range of microprocessors, which supply the
primary brain power for computers.
</P>
<P>
Intel introduced the 450 and 500 MHz Pentium III processor in
the first quarter and expects to launch the 550 MHz Pentium III
processor in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
The company also announced a faster Celeron processor in the
first quarter for a fast-growing category of personal computers
costing less than 1,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Intel officials said the Celeron chips are starting to help the
company take back some business from rival makers of chips for
inexpensive PCs, such as Advanced Micro Devices.
</P>
<P>
However, Intel said it expects second-quarter revenue to stay
the same or fall slightly from that of its first-quarter, citing "
seasonal factors" in the microprocessor business.

<P>
PRAGUE, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Direct foreign investments in
Czech last year rocketed to 2.5 billion U.S. dollars, 92.8 percent
up from 1997, according to statistics Tuesday from the national
bank.
</P>
<P>
Figures show that investments in the service and commerce
sector topped the list with 780 million dollars, followed by that
in the finance sector, 470 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, investments made directly by foreigners in
Czech dropped considerably due to the country's deteriorating
environment.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 and 1997, foreign companies and individuals only put in
1.4 and 1.3 billion dollars respectively, far below those absorbed
during the same period by Hungary and Poland.
</P>
<P>
Set for a change, the Czech government unveiled last April a
package of favored policies to attract foreign capitals such as
five-year tax exempt for investments over 25 million dollars, tax
waive for high-tech equipment and zero-interest loan for foreign
land-users.
</P>
<P>
Czech, a small Eastern European country, has obtained a total
of 10.5 billion dollars in direct foreign investments since its
economic transformation in 1990.

<HEADLINE> East, West China Highlight Transfer of Technological Results (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, April 14 (Xinhua) -- East China's Anhui Province has
obtained more than 20 million yuan in economic profits annually
from watermelon transactions, while watermelon seeds were a
scientific and technological result of northwest China's Shaanxi
Province.
</P>
<P>
Huge profits from regional transfer of scientific and
technological results show a bright future for cooperation between
eastern and western China, analysts note.
</P>
<P>
The number of scientific and technological transfer projects
made up nearly one-third of all projects negotiated at the '99
China East-West Cooperation and Investment Trade Fair, which ended
in this capital city of Shaanxi Province on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A special science and technology hall was set up to exhibit
achievements, make transactions, and disseminate information, and
a continuous flow of business people visited the hall. Some
enterprises were surprised that their introductory materials could
be released in only one or two days.
</P>
<P>
Eastern and western provinces signed agreements on 204 projects
involving the transfer of scientific and technological fruits at
the seven-day fair, with a business volume of nearly 1.8 billion
yuan, statistics show.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 30,000 items of scientific and technological results
have been produced in China annually, but only 20 percent of them
can be applied to large-scale production, and less than five
percent are capable of fostering an entire industry, according to
an official from the Ministry of Science and Technology.
</P>
<P>
The official blamed this situation on inadequate investment for
scientific and technological development and the lack of various
information exchange activities, such as the East-West Cooperation
Fair.

and Slovak Republic in 1993.
</P>
<P>

BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- State-run museums and libraries
should alter their current procedures for collecting cultural
relics, according to today's Wenhui Daily.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper reported that a number of related institutions

<P>
For example, the Shanghai History Museum recently advertised

<HEADLINE> Caribbean Summit to Condemn U.S. Blockade Against Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTO DOMINGO, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The second Summit of the
Association of Caribbean States (ACS), to be held here Friday and
Saturday, will issue a declaration condemning the U.S. blockade
against Cuba, sources close to the summit said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to a draft document of the final declaration obtained
by Xinhua, the Caribbean countries denounce any single-sided
actions against any nation and reject the application of extra-
territorial legislation contrary to international laws designed to
protect the sovereignty of all states and international co-
existence.
</P>
<P>
Explicitly referring to the anti-Cuban Helms-Burton law imposed
by the United States years ago, the Santo Domingo Declaration
exhorts Washington to put an end to the legislation and to deal
with Cuba in accordance with UN resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The draft declaration also reviews the regional entity's
achievements of the last four years, noting that tourism in the
region has made significant progress.
</P>
<P>
It indicates that sustainable tourism has made a good response
to the challenges of increasing employment rates and foreign
currency earnings, and will ratify the adoption of a sustainable
tourism zone in the Caribbean region.
</P>
<P>
The document urges member states of the regional association to
work together for the consolidation of a wide economic area for
tourism and investment on the basis of the principles of the World
Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
The declaration, to be made public on Saturday at the end of
the Second Caribbean Summit, also emphasizes that the association
should respect sovereignty and the rules of non-intervention,
allowing each nation to peacefully construct its own political
system.
</P>
<P>
It also advocates social and economic policies oriented to the
achievement of harmonic and integral development based on social
equity and justice.
</P>
<P>
The draft declaration pledges Caribbean states' commitment to
contribute to the success of the summit of Latin American -
European Union, which will take place this summer in Rio de
Janeiro, Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The summit, to be attended by government heads of the Dominican
Republic, Jamaica, Santa Lucia, St. Vicente, Granada and Belize,
is regarded as a good opportunity to promote a concerted regional
action and preparation for the dialogue with Europe.

<HEADLINE> Health Cards for Twin Giant Panda Cubs at Beijing Zoo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The six-month-old twin giant
panda cubs at the Beijing Zoo were given health cards and
registration numbers today after a team of veterinarians concluded
tests on the young animals.
</P>
<P>
These cards symbolizes that the two cubs have met survival
standards and are growing properly.
</P>
<P>
The vets explained that that it is routine to do checkups and
testing on six-month-old giant pandas, and if they pass
successfully, to consider them healthy and issue registration
numbers.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang Jinguo, deputy head of the zoo, various
indicators suggest that the giant panda cubs are growing normally.
The twin cubs are both male and weigh 17 kilograms each. They
were born to their mother Le Le last September.
</P>
<P>
Giant pandas are an endangered species and it is estimated that
there are only about 1,000 left in the world, most of them living
in the mountains around the Sichuan Basin in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Zoo is the largest in China with 6,000 animals of
650 species, including 17 giant pandas, only one of which was born
in the wild.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment Inflow in Myanmar Plummets in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar received a total of 247
million U.S. dollars of foreign investment in 1998, accounting for
only 19.6 and 10.73 percent of that drawn in 1997 and 1996
respectively, according to the latest official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, investment in the manufacturing sector made up
the highest with 181 million dollars in 10 projects, followed by
that in hotels and tourism with 40 million dollars in one project,
the Central Statistical Organization (CSO) said.
</P>
<P>
Investment in fishery amounted to 10.82 million dollars in two
projects, mining got 7.585 million dollars in five projects and
oil and gas 7.2 million dollars in one project.
</P>
<P>
Last year, there were no foreign investment injected into other
sectors such as agriculture, construction, transport and real
estate.
</P>
<P>
The Economic Indicators issued by the CSO attributed the
falling foreign investment to the impact of the Asian financial
crisis which has lasted for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, a total of 26 foreign companies, mainly from South
Korea, Malaysia, Thailand and Japan, have pulled out of Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The statistics also show that since Myanmar adopted the
open-door economic policy, it has absorbed 7.1 billion dollars of
foreign investment from 23 countries and regions.

<HEADLINE> Video Server Market Grows in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Video servers will replace
video cassette recorders in functionality, with the added benefit
of opening new and prosperous markets in the United States, a
study released Tuesday forecast.
</P>
<P>
The video server market in the United States totaled 532
million U.S. dollars in 1998, an increase of 45 percent over 1997
revenues, according to a research study by Frost &AMP; Sullivan, a
California-based marketing company.
</P>
<P>
"The approach of the digital age is unstoppable, and soon
virtually all media created will be in digital form," the company
said. A significant part of this future includes digital video
and consequently video servers.
</P>
<P>
Video servers are uniquely poised to deliver digital video
content over a network, including broadcast and cable networks,
local area networks (LANs) and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The video server market can be broken down into hardware-
dependent solutions and independent software solutions. The former
reached 423 million dollars in revenues in 1998, an increase of 35
percent. In contrast, the independent video server software market
totaled 110 million dollars last year, an increase of 103 percent,
according to the study.
</P>
<P>
Despite restraints such as high costs of implementation, lack
of hardware industry standards and video compression standards,
the company said, the market for video servers continues to
flourish with no end in sight as the digital age grows nearer.

<HEADLINE> Bolivia to Attempt Eradication of Hoof-And-Mouth Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LA PAZ, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The Bolivian government will
attempt to eradicate hoof-and-mouth disease found among cattle
throughout the country within the next five years, a Bolivian
official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The program, financed by the Latin American Development Bank (
LADB), the World Bank (WB) and other organizations, is intended to
enable the country to export meat to its neighbors, and other
countries such as the U.S. and Europe, said Leandro Rocha,
director of the project against hoof-and-mouth disease in the
livestock department of Beni.
</P>
<P>
The LADB and the WB have promised to help with the government
plan, and in the next few days will respond to a request for a
loan of 24 million U.S. dollars to carry out the program, said
Rocha.
</P>
<P>
Foot-and-mouth disease has a high incidence rate in Bolivian
cattle. It is the main obstacle to meat exports, as the World
Health Organization (WHO) and the Panamanian Health Organization (
PHO) prohibit international sales of meat products if they are not
free from the disease.
</P>
<P>
An organization technically dependent on the PHO is in charge
of evaluating the immunization of animals in countries of the
region and grants their export.
</P>
<P>
At least 60,000 heads of cattle are free from foot-and-mouth
disease in Bolivia's San Ramon region, but this number is
insignificant compared with the 3 million cattle throughout San
Ramon, the main cattle producer in Bolivia.
</P>
<P>
The government has no specific statistics on the percentage of
cattle free from the disease in the 5 million head of cattle
throughout the country.

<HEADLINE> IAAF Dismisses Legal Action by Slaney over Doping Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The world athletics ruling body
International Amateur Athletics Federation (IAAF) made light of
the legal action taken by former world champion American Mary
Slaney and decided Tuesday to continue pursuing her doping case.
</P>
<P>
The American star filed a suit on Monday attempting to halt an
arbitration hearing against her and prevent the IAAF and U.S.
Olympic Committee using a testosterone ratio as proof of doping by
women athletes.
</P>
<P>
The IAAF received a letter from the athlete's lawyers on Monday,
which rejected the findings of a dope test and resolved to take
the matter to an Indianapolis court.
</P>
<P>
"In whichever country, civil justice does not have the right to
judge sporting rules of an international federation," said IAAF
spokesman Giorgio Reineri.
</P>
<P>
"The IAAF does not recognise the jurisdiction of Indiana in
such an affair. The arbitration hearing will take place as planned
even if Mary Slaney does not attend and the IAAF will be
represented by its lawyers at the Indiana hearing," Reineri added.
</P>
<P>
Slaney, 40, the former world 1500m and 3000m champion tested
positive during the American 1996 trials for an illegally high
level of testosterone-epitestosterone.
</P>
<P>
She was banned the following year but reinstated by the U.S.
track and field federation later even though the IAAF referred the
case to the arbitration tribunal to be held in Monaco on April 24.

<HEADLINE> Austria Backs Initiative for Southeastern Europe Stabilization Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Austria supports the initiative for
drawing up a stabilization plan on Southeastern Europe and for
holding a pan-Balkan conference after the end of the Kosovo
conflict, visiting Austrian President Thomas Klestil said here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At a joint news conference with his Bulgarian counterpart Peter
Stoyanov, Klestil said the stabilization pact will be discussed
within the European Union (EU) and may be accepted by the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
</P>
<P>
The Austrian president, who arrived here for a two-day official
visit, noted that the future stability of central and eastern
Europe is in the interests of the EU.
</P>
<P>
Agenda of the conference could include issues related to ethnic
minorities, human rights and infrastructure in the region, said
Klestil.
</P>
<P>
In response, Bulgarian President Petar Stoyanov said the
conference may also consider drafting a plan on the region's
economic prosperity, adding that although he did not like to draw
parallels, "an analogy to the Marshal plan would not be
inappropriate in this case."
</P>
<P>
He said extreme nationalist, ethnic and religious sentiments
leading to conflicts in the Balkans would fade out after people
enjoy better living standards and start feeling part of the big
European family.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Klestil is scheduled to meet with Bulgarian Prime
Minister Ivan Kostov, National Assembly Chairman Yordan Sokolov
and Sofia Mayor Stefan Sofiyanski.

<HEADLINE> China to Enhance Tourism Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- China's top tourism
administration is urging local governments and tourism departments
to enhance management of the tourism industry program.
</P>
<P>
China National Tourism Administration (CNTA) recently issued
the Provisional Regulations on the Management of the Development
Program of Tourism, which focuses on the industry's sustainable
development, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The regulations, contained in four chapters and 27 articles,
require management of the national and local tourism industry
program be guided by the CNTA and local tourism administrations.
</P>
<P>
The regulations stipulate tourism development must not be at
the expense of protecting natural resources and preventing
environment pollution.
</P>
<P>
The tourism program should generally be a five-year plan or
longer, and establish the scale, structure and rational
distribution of the industry.
</P>
<P>
It should also define the industry's role and functions within
the national economy.
</P>
<P>
The tourism program should include seven items, including a
general assessment of natural resources and basic conditions and a
long-term development strategy in line with market demands.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-four of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and
autonomous regions have made tourism one of their pillar
industries.
</P>
<P>
But some areas do not have a standard tourism program, mainly
because China did not have a unified administration or technical
specifications.
</P>
<P>
CNTA is reportedly drafting a Tourism Program General Rule (
State Standard) and detailed technical specifications for
developing tourism.

JAKARTA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia will compete in the
five-day Quadrangular Tournament for Olympic teams at Bukit Jalil
National Stadium, Kuala Lumpur, as a warmup for the soccer
prequalifying round for the Sydney Olympics next year.
</P>
<P>
All-Indonesian Soccer Federation (PSSI) secretary for the
national team John Halmahera said that PSSI would select 18 under-
23-year players from several clubs to compete in the tournament,
which will feature Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand and host Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The event will be held from April 26 to April 30.
</P>
<P>
"We have been grooming 24 players before we make selections for
a two-day tryout against the Cambodian national team on April 18
and April 20 at Lebak Bulus stadium, South Jakarta," he was quoted
by The Jakarta Post Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
PSSI secretary-general Nugraha Besoes said that Olympic
prequalification would start in May. PSSI would not set a high
target in the prequalification because of strong competition.
</P>
<P>
"We have estimated the pre-Olympics target. We are being
realistic. We are facing strong teams. We may be able to overcome
Sri Lanka and Chinese Taipei, but it will be hard to beat South
Korea and Japan," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nugraha said PSSI would develop the national team training
program to improve the players' performance.
</P>
<P>
"The improvement is not only for the short term, but also to
prepare our players to compete in the Asian Cup and the pre-World
Cup championship next year," he said.
</P>
<P>
The team also would compete in the 20th Southeast Asian (SEA)
Games in Brunei Darussalam in August.
</P>
<P>
Nugraha said that after the SEA Games, PSSI would send teams to
the Asian Champions Cup and Asian Winners' Cup and pre Asian Cup
championship.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian President Leaves to Visit Three European Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso left here Tuesday evening for Rio de Janiero from
where he will go to Europe to visit Germany, Portugal and the
United Kingdom from April 13-20.
</P>
<P>
This is the first international journey for Cardoso in his
second presidential term, which began on January 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
During his first stop in Germany from April 14-16, he will meet
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder. He will also meet numerous
businessmen and bankers to promote bilateral economic exchanges
and seek new business opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Germany is Brazil's most important commercial partner in Europe.
The bilateral trade volume reached 8.29 billion dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Germany is also the third largest investor in Brazil, with its
total investment reaching 10 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
In Portugal, Cardoso will try to strengthen political, economic,
commercial and cultural relations between the two countries. He
will also discuss details regarding the 500th year commemoration
of the discovery of Brazil by the Portuguese.
</P>
<P>
In Britain, Cardoso and Prime Minister Tony Blair will discuss
a wide range of subjects, including trade, investment, education,
science and technology, human rights, the fight against organized
crime, terrorism and participation in peace-keeping operations.
</P>
<P>
Brazil and the United Kingdom signed a Joint Action Plan in
1997 that established the Brazilian-British Association. Last year
Britain was the eighth largest destination for Brazilian exports,
which totaled 1.33 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> China's Bone Marrow Banks Seek Donations, Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua)-- China's bone marrow banks are
struggling to combat a lack of funds, today's "China Daily"
reported.
</P>
<P>
This Beijing-based English newspaper discloses that the Beijing
bank, operated by the Red Cross Society of China, cannot afford to
do blood tests for volunteers, who come every day offering to
donate bone marrow. Marrow transfusion has been proven as the most
effective way of treating leukemia.
</P>
<P>
Each test requires about 250 yuan (30 U.S. dollars of imported
serum reagents, a large sum for a charity organization such as the
Red Cross. Home-made reagents are cheaper, but their quality
cannot be guaranteed, according to Red Cross sources.
</P>
<P>
When the Beijing bank was set up in March 1992, the Red Cross
expected to gather a total of 100,000 blood samples. However,
after six years of constant struggle, the bank has only managed to
collect the modest amount of 5,000 samples.
</P>
<P>
"If our database was ten times bigger than it is now, we could
ask for a service fee from those who come to seek help. And we
could also charge them once the ideal marrow was found. Then the
bank would be able to support itself and continuously expand its
database," said Hong Junling, an official of the China Red Cross
Society.
</P>
<P>
"But at present, it is unfair to charge people who come to us,
because we have little hope to offer them."
</P>
<P>
The bank was only successful once in the past six year, finding
the right marrow for a Shanghai boy in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The marrow banks in Shanghai and Guangzhou are a bit larger
than the Beijing one, containing 7,000 and 15,000 samples each
thanks to donations by local people.
</P>
<P>
The incidence of leukemia in China is about three to four per
100,000, the paper reported.

<HEADLINE> Austrian Chancellor Says No to Joining NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima
said Tuesday he strongly opposes Austria's joining the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
Austria must remain neutral so as to mediate between the
conflicting sides related to the Kosovo issue, Klima said in a TV
interview.
</P>
<P>
The chancellor, speaking against statements by some government
members about Austria giving up neutrality and joining NATO, said
all government members should abide by the constitution which
stipulates Austria's neutrality.
</P>
<P>
The People's Party, coalition partner of Klima's Social
Democrats, argued that it's redundant to maintain Austria's
neutrality because the Cold War is over and Austria is a member of
the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Klima said Austria favors a political solution of the Kosovo
issue and its task is to carry out humanitarian mission. This
security policy of Austria is correct and important, he said.
</P>
<P>
Neutral Austria said on March 24 that in line with its normal
practice, it would ban NATO aircraft from flying through its
airspace to launch air strikes against Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> D'Alema Says No Attack Plans for Italian Troops in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Massimo
D'Alema assured parliament Tuesday that Italian troops involved in
humanitarian mission in the Balkans would not be used in any
military action against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema recalled that NATO had decided to limit its action to
air strikes and had made no provision for the deployment of ground
troops.
</P>
<P>
"We confirm that decision," he said, adding that the use of
ground forces to invade Yugoslavia was not feasible with the 8,000
NATO troops and 2,000 Italian ones now posted in Albania.
</P>
<P>
He went on to defend his government's stance during the Kosovo
crisis, denying that its allegiance to NATO had been muddied by
its support for peace initiatives from Italy.
</P>
<P>
After the speech of D'Alema in both houses, the Senate and the
Chamber of Deputies approved the government motion authorizing the
deployment of Italian troops in the Balkans exclusively for
humanitarian missions to aid refugees from the war in Yugoslavia.

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
The Philippine Post:
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
The Philippine Star:
</P>
<P>
-- The Philippine government is dropping its plan to tax the

CANBERRA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Australian newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian:
</P>
<P>
-- The Howard government is considering funding rural medical
scholarships in an effort to find a long-term solution to the
critical shortage of doctors in the bush. The "bonded scholarship
scheme is being considered as the government finalizes health
financing ahead of the May 11 budget.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald:
</P>
<P>
-- The Australian federal government believes that Jakarta has
lost control of elements of the Indonesian armed forces in East
Timor. One highly placed government source warned that massive
disruption could scuttle the proposed U.N. consultation with the
East Timorese people on their future in July.
</P>
<P>
The Age:
</P>
<P>
-- Australians have been advised to leave East Timor as the
violence there escalates. The Australian embassy in Jakarta warned
that only those with compelling reasons to stay should remain on
the island.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review:
</P>
<P>
-- The Australian economy shows few signs of slowing down and
business conditions improved from already high levels. A leading

<HEADLINE> Sino-US Ocean Science Co-operation Rewarding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Sino-US co-operation over the
past 20 years in oceanic science and technology has reaped
noteworthy achievements in three major projects which are
significant for the world's marine and atmosphere studies, today's
China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The three co-operation projects involve research on the Yangtze
River mouth area's deposition and the ocean-atmosphere inter-
relation in the tropical western Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
These projects have collected very precious data which are
indispensable for studying the world's major oceanic phenomena,
such as El Nino, according to officials with the State
Oceanographic Administration (SOA) of China.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have conducted more than 100 investigations,
research and exchange projects in oceanic data-collection, oceanic
meteorology, and marine geology, geological resources and
environment over the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
The research and investigations are carried out under the
Marine and Fisheries Protocol of the 1979 US-China Science and
Technology Agreement.
</P>
<P>
The protocol enabled the United States to become the first
country to sign inter-governmental agreements with China on
oceanic science and technology co-operation.
</P>
<P>
China is still developing oceanic resources-exploitation, while
the US is a developed country in resources exploitation and which
adopts a world perspective in oceanic development strategy. That's
why China can learn a lot from this bilateral co-operation on
oceanographic science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Coastal management, oceanic-disaster prevention and control,
and the ocean's function in global atmospheric changes, are the
priority fields for future co-operation by the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are working together on integrated coastal
management, as three marine reserves under State protection in
each country have been identified as partners so as to address
common environmental concerns.

MANILA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Socio-Economic Planning
Secretary Felipe Medalla expected the country's GDP to grow by one
percent in the first quarter which will enable the government to
meet the low-end of 1999 growth target, the Malaya newspaper said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Medalla was quoted as saying that he is hopeful that growth
will come from higher agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
He said the private sector has been slow in responding to the
government's pump-priming efforts.
</P>
<P>
Under the government's program, the gross domestic product
(GDP) is expected to grow at a range of 2.6 to 3.1 percent while
the gross national product (GNP) must grow at a range of 3.0 to
3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Although the agriculture sector has been showing some clear
signs of recovery, there is a strong need to stimulate
investments, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
In earlier reports, Medalla cited loan contraction as the "wet
blanket" for higher economic growth, the newspaper said.

BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua)-- Approximately 397,000 hectares of
Chinese farmland have been lost to economic expansion and severe
natural disasters in the past two years, according to a report
from the Ministry of National Land and Resources.
</P>

China lost some 135,000 hectares of farmland despite a "land
freeze" on land approval in 1997, and in 1998, 261,300 hectares of
farmland were lost owing to floods, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The report said that grass-roots governments are largely
responsible for approving farmland for other use and thus reducing
the amount of land available for growing crops.
</P>
<P>
About 66 percent of Chinese farmland is located in mountainous
and plateau areas, and one-fifth of the land has been polluted to

<HEADLINE> China Mass Produces Bio-Virus Pesticide for Vegetable Moths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The Huanye Biological
Pesticide Factory based in Shijiazhuang, capital of north China's
Hebei Province, recently began mass-producing a bio-virus
pesticide - Huanye No.2 - with the approval of the Ministry of
Agriculture and the State Administration of Petroleum and Chemical
Industries.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, the pesticide, developed in 1997 by a
team of biologists who had spent a dozen years on the project, has
produced an effective rate of over 92 percent when applied to
large stretches of vegetable farmland on an experimental basis in
provinces including Jiangsu, Hubei and Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
In those experiments, vegetable-growers sprayed the pesticide
on the vegetables and the virus multiplied and duplicated inside
the bodies of the moths after they had eaten the pesticide. The
moths eventually lost physiological balance, became liquefied, and
died.
</P>
<P>
A panel of expert appraisers said they believe this pesticide
is the first of its kind in the world, and various technical
indicators have met international advanced standards.
</P>
<P>
They also conclude that the pesticide is environment-friendly
and low-cost, and its application is safe, leaving no harmful
residues on vegetables and producing no harmful effects in humans,
livestock, or aquatic animals.

<HEADLINE> Britain, Iran to Renew Relations-- UK Foreign Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 13 (Xinhua) - Britain and Iran are expected to
end years of diplomatic quarrel with the imminent appointment of
ambassadors in each other's capitals, a British Foreign Office
spokesman said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We remain committed to an agreement to exchange ambassadors.
We hope to exchange ambassadors shortly," a Reuters report quoted
a Foreign Office spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
The exchange of ambassadors would formally revive the political
and economic relations between the two countries, which was
severed years ago when Iran's late leader, Ayatollah Khomeini,
issued a death decree on British author Salman Rushdie.
</P>
<P>
Rushdie was accused of blasphemy against the prophet Mohammad
in his novel "The Satanic Verses."
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Office Minister Derek Fatchett is planning a
visit to Tehran. His visit would be the first by a British minister
since the Islamic revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
"(Fatchett) hopes to visit soon but no dates have yet been
set," the spokesman said.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Brian Wilson, visiting British
Minister for Trade in the Department of Trade and Industry, Sunday
urged British companies to double their efforts to enter the Kuwaiti
markets.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait is the third largest Gulf market for British goods after
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Wilson told Kuwait
News Agency while meeting with British businessmen here.
</P>
<P>
British exports to Kuwait were around 335 million sterling
pounds(552 million U.S. dollars) last year, he said, adding the figure
only included consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
British businessmen should put into consideration that Kuwait needs
services in education, training, medical and financial sectors, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The minister, who arrived here monday to attend the "Britain in
Kuwait" exhibition, also highlighted promotion of ties with other Gulf
states to boost the British economy.
</P>
<P>
He said over 300 small and medium British firms are interested in
doing business in the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
British exports to the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states
reached some 5.3 billion pounds (about 8.7 billion dollars) annually.

<HEADLINE> Liberia Calls for U.N. Military Observers in S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The Liberian government has asked
the United Nations to send military observers to the
Liberian-Sierra Leone border, a report reaching here said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Liberian Defense Minister Daniel Chea said Tuesday that this
was the best way to prove or disprove allegations by the west
African peace-keeping force ECOMOG that Liberia is backing the
Sierra Leonean rebels.
</P>
<P>
The Liberian minister described as irresponsible a warning
last week by new ECOMOG Commander General Felix Mujakpero that
the ECOMOG force would strike at channels supplying the rebels of
the Revolutionary United Front in Sierra leone.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that the Liberian authorities were taking the
threat seriously, and were preparing to send reinforcements to
the border.
</P>
<P>
The minister pointed out that the Liberian government had
acknowledged that Liberians were fighting in Sierra leone, but
that they were doing so without official backing.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Mujakpero said in capital Freetown that the present
 tension between ECOMOG and the Liberian government was sparked
off by a massive arms shipment by Liberia on behalf of the rebels
in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
He threatened to strike at all the channels involved in the
movement of heavy arms and ammunition to the rebels by land, sea
and air.
</P>
<P>
Mujakpero specifically warned the government of President
Charles Taylor that "we will no longer watch this mischief by
supposed leaders continuing side by side with the peace efforts by
the government of Sierra Leone."

<HEADLINE> Lebanese President Hails China's Stance on Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Emile Lahoud
Tuesday praised the Chinese government's consistent support for
Lebanon's just cause and expressed the hope that more Chinese
enterprises will take part in his country's post-war reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
While meeting with Chinese Ambassador in Beirut Liu Zhentang who
assumed his position last month, Lahoud said China has been supporting
Arab just cause to safeguard territorial integrity and state
independence, especially on south Lebanon issue.
</P>
<P>
Israel is occupying a self-proclaimed security zone in south
Lebanon with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 425 two
decades ago, which called for an unconditional Israeli withdrawal from
the country.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet last year endorsed the resolution but
conditioned its implementation with a negotiated security arrangement
before any pullout.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon rejected the offer, asking the Jewish state to leave the
country without any preconditions.
</P>
<P>
China has been urging Israel to apply the resolution and withdraw
its troops to the internationally recognized border without any
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on bilateral economic cooperation, Lahoud said his country
is working on a massive reconstruction drive to rebuild the
war-devastated economy.
</P>
<P>
He called on more Chinese companies to take part in Lebanon's
reconstruction campaigns and thus enhance economic cooperation between
the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Terms Asia Tour Important, Fruitful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Terming his Aisa tour as important,
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said on Saturday that it would
benefit his country.
</P>
<P>
The tour would reflect well on Egypt within the context of
partnership and the agreements signed between Egypt and each of
China, South Korea and Japan, Mubarak told Egyptian reporters after
concluding his Asian trip.
</P>
<P>
During his tour to China, South Korea and Japan from April 5-13,
Mubarak held talks with leaders of the three countries on ways of
promoting bilateral political and economic ties and on regional and
international issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
Egypt signed scores of agreements on cooperation in trade and
investments with the three countries.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said that businessmen in China , South Korea and Japan
``were highly interested in `` investing in Egypt and promised to
probe the vistas of separate or joint investments in the country,
Egypt's Middle east News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Northwest Gulf of Suez Industrial zone and other free trade
zones in Egypt grabbed the interest of Chinese, South Korean and
Japanese investors, the president.
</P>
<P>
The economic progress that Egypt has made and its political and
economic stability have drawn the interest of the three countries,
encouraged by the friendship that binds them with Egypt, Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
Many investors of the three countries have shown keenness on
investing in the 10th Ramadan and 6th October, two newly-built
industrial towns near Cairo, he added.
</P>
<P>
``Egypt has the opportunity to proceed with its renaissance and
realize welfare if we work seriously and prepare ourselves to
shoulder this responsibilty, `` the president said.
</P>
<P>
``We present the land, location and market and they (investors)
bring along investments and technology and this is the basis of
partnership,`` he added.

<HEADLINE> Arafat: Statehood Declaration is Palestinian People's sovereign Right by Qi Deliang, Ma Xiaolin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"But, consider the stalemate the Mideast peace process faces and
the general elections (that) will be held in Israel and other actors,
we have been consulting this matter with friendly countries in the
world including China," Arafat added.
</P>
<P>
Arafat made those remarks in an interview with Chinese reporters
based in Israel on the eve of his working visit to China starting
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said his main purpose for visiting China is to consult with
Chinese leaders over the issue of declaring an independent Palestinian
state and to seek their advice.
</P>
<P>
Countries in Europe, Asia, Africa and Arab nations that he has
visited recently have all unanimously expressed their support to the
right of the self-determination of the Palestinian people and their
right of establishing an independent Palestinian state free of any
pro-conditions, Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the declaration adopted in March by heads of
governments of the EU in Berlin, Arafat stressed that the EU
declaration reflected the basic changes among the EU nations, because
those countries have expressed strong support to the right of the
self-determination of the Palestinian people and their right to
establish an independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the reports that the United States has asked the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to delay its statehood
declaration while promising only to help speed up the peace process,
Arafat said that consultation with the U.S. is still going on this
issue, hoping the U.S. could change its attitude.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the Sino-Palestinian relations, Arafat said that China
is among the countries that have long given support to the Palestinian
people's cause. He expressed his hope that the two sides will
strengthen further the friendly cooperation in the future.
</P>
<P>
On the current development of the Mideast peace process, Arafat
said the peace process has faced stalemate again due to the Israeli
government's refusal to further implement the principle of "land for
peace."
</P>
<P>
He strongly urged the Israeli side to implement the Wye agreement
signed between the two sides last October in Washington to move the
precess forward.
</P>
<P>
The basis for moving the peace process forward is to implement the
principle of "land for peace" that has been stipulated in the
resolution 242 and resolution 338 adopted by the United Nations, and
this region could not have peace if the Israeli government still
refuses to implement this principle and withdraw its troops from the
Arab lands which Israel occupied in the 1967 war, he said.
</P>
<P>
Rejecting Israel's claims that the Palestinian side has not
fulfilled its commitments under the Wye agreement, Arafat said the
U.S. Administration, EU and even Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Arens
have said that the Palestinian side has carried out is obligations
under the Wye accord, particularly in the fields of security
cooperation, ratification of the Palestinian charter and confiscation
of illegal weapons in the territories.
</P>
<P>
The fact is that the Israeli government has refused to fulfill its
part of the obligations under the Wye, which include pullout of its
troops from the West Bank, release of 750 Palestinian political
prisoners from Israeli jails and submitting of the time-table for
their release, opening of the safe passage between the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, start of the construction of the Gaza port and
implementation of the agreement concerning economic cooperation
between the two sides, he said.
</P>
<P>
The PNA, together with the United States and EU, is trying hard
to force Israel to implement this agreement, but the Israeli side
still rejects doing so under the pretext of holding elections in May
this year, he said, adding this is the main reason why the peace
process has faced another impasse since last December.
