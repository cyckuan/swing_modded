<HEADLINE> Foundation Records Record 71 Little Wars Worldwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Years after the Cold War,
people suffered from a record 71 "little wars" worldwide in 1995,
according to the National Defense Council Foundation.
</P>
<P>
The Foundation, which is sided with political conservatives
against defense cuts, lists any country where turmoil has
disrupted its economics, politics or security. By that measure,
the research and lobbying foundation counted 71 little wars last
year, one more than the year before, which was double the number
in the organization's first tally in 1989.
</P>
<P>
The foundation's listing includes bloodshed from Afghanistan to
Yemen and in lands as diverse as Comoros, which suffered an
attempted coup, and the United States, included because of drug
violence and organized crime.
</P>
<P>
About a fourth of the conflicts on the foundation list involve
drug violence. Most drug violence is not listed on other conflict
compilations.
</P>
<P>
But a CIA spokesman said the U.S. agency counted 27 conflicts
during the year, listing only those with "high levels of organized
violence between states or between contending groups within a
state or with high levels of political or societal tension likely
to erupt into violence".
</P>
<P>
The Washington-based Center for Defense Information, a research
group did a count last spring that found 20 active wars and a
dozen less intense or latent wars and political conflicts. The
group noted that several major conflicts, including those in
Bosnia, Nicaragua, Angola and Cambodia actually subsided in 1995.

<HEADLINE> State Of Emergency Declared in 5 Central Mozambican Counties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Five central Mozambican
counties have been put in a state of emergency because of the
increasing poverty.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambique Information Agency today quoted Governor of
Sofala Province Felisberto Tomas as declaring emergency
measures for the five counties including Maringue and Caia.
</P>
<P>
Tomas said on Monday that the five counties were the worst hit
during the years of civil war, which destroyed most of the
infrastructure in the area.
</P>
<P>
The thrust of the emergency measures is a preferential tax
policy aimed at attracting investment into the area.
</P>
<P>
The government will also offer subsidies to public servants
and technicians to encourage them to work in those counties.
</P>
<P>
A special fund will be allocated to the reconstruction work in
the area and other proper steps may be taken to promote
production of cotton, sunflower and other cash crops in the area,
according to the governor.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Confirms Three Nigerian Soldiers Died In Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian Defence Headquarters
has confirmed the deaths of three Nigerian soldiers in recent
clashes with fighters of a ULIMO faction in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to newsmen today, Director of Defence Information
Fred Chijuka said their bodies were flown home over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to reports that seven Nigerian soldiers were killed
in the clashes, Chijuka said the Defence Headquarters had not
received such reports.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian-led western African peacekeeping force in Liberia
has warned the Liberian armed factions to desist from such acts
capable of hindering the peace process in the war-torn naion, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Chijuka urged all the factions in Liberia to try and comply
with the provisions of the Abuja Peace Agreement they signed in
August, 1995, to end the civil war, which started in December,
1989.
</P>
<P>
The defence spokesman, however, expressed optimism that there
was still "high hopes" for the Liberian peace process in spite of
the recent clashes with the peacekeepers in Liberia.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 2 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major
is facing an infighting again in his Tory party as rival factions
blame each other for the party's problem.
</P>
<P>
The new battle between the Right and Left has been stirred up
by the December 29 defection of a former Tory parliament member
Emma Nicholson to the Liberal Democrats, the second largest
opposition.
</P>
<P>
The defector criticized the Conservative government for its
indecision and weak leadership on Europe.
</P>
<P>
She also accused the Tory party of drifting to the Right.
</P>
<P>
The Tory Right-wingers poured scorn on the defector, but caused
a strong counterattack from Left wingers.
</P>
<P>
John Redwood, who challenged Major in the Tory leadership
contest last June, rejected Nicholson's claim that the party was
drifting to the Right, saying that in fact Major's cabinet was the
most Left-wing that a Conservative prime minister has chosen in
living memory.
</P>
<P>
As a leading Eurosceptic, Redwood accused the government of
allowing more national powers to be siphoned off by Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Major's government was too afraid of being isolated in Europe
to dig in for British interests in the way that margaret Thatcher
had, he said.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Michael Portillo described Nicholson's charge
as "very silly".
</P>
<P>
He said that since Major has come to power with Michael
Heseltine as Deputy Prime Minister and Kenneth Clarke as
Chancellor of the Exchequer, "the party is probably much the same.
we have a broad breadth of opinion within the party."
</P>
<P>
However, former prime minister Edward Heath rebuffed Redwood
and Portillo, saying that the Tory party had clearly taken an
anti-European stance and that Nicholson's defection should be
heeded.
</P>
<P>
The Sun Tabloid said that Major was now plunged in a new
leadership crisis as the infighting among Tories is escalating.
</P>
<P>
And there were grim warnings that Major could face new pressure
to quit in spring unless he "gets a grip fast" to end the
squabbling, the newspaper added.

<HEADLINE> Increase In Police Budget Vital For Fighting Crime: Fivaz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 2 (Xinhua)-- An increase in the police
budget was a main factor in curbing cirme this year, South
Africa's National Police Commissioner George Fivaz said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Pretoria, Fivaz said South Africa
would risk becoming a "gangster state where hijackers,
drug-lords, muggers and other criminals would trample hard-won
democratic rights into the dust unless the South African Police
Service (SAPS) was given every means necessary to fight crime."
</P>
<P>
"If crime goes on unhindered this year, the possibility exists
that certain areas could fall into anarchy. we must avoid this at
all cost," Fivaz said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that efforts would be made to root out corruption
and racism in the SAPS and to increase the performance,
productivity and discipline of all its members.
</P>
<P>
He also appealed to the government to give the highest
possible priority to providing the SAPS with the necessary
crime-fighting resources in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"The SAPS has already geared itself, with its available
resources, to intensify the struggle against crime in 1996," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Fivaz said strengthening community confidence in the SAPS
through quality policing was important and the welfare and morale
of police members must be improved as a matter of urgency.

<HEADLINE> Most European Stock Markets Bullish At Start of 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 2 (Xinhua) -- European stock markets had a
healthy start today in the first trading day of 1996. Paris and
Frankfurt gained more than one percent, London set a new intraday
high although it ended slightly lower.
</P>
<P>
British shares had a roller-coaster. It opened in buoyant mood,
as tips on a number of shares offered by the weekend press
encouraged investors to buy. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange
index of 100 leading shares soon surged to an all-time high of
3,696.5.
</P>
<P>
But political concern over the defection of a ruling
Conservative member of parliament (MP) to the opposition forced
shares down.
</P>
<P>
The defection, which came at the year end, could lead to more
similar actions by Conservative MPs and even cause an early
general election as Prime Minister John Major's party was feared
to be reduced to the minority in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
But London shares were later boosted by a strong opening of
Wall Street, offseting some of the losses earlier and closed at
3,687.9, only 1.4 points lower than the all-time closing high of
3,689.3, reached in the previous trading day on December 29, 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Paris CAC-40 index was helped by hopes of lower interest
rates and the bullish bonds, ending up 36.41 at 1,908.38, the
highest since August 30, 1995.
</P>
<P>
The 30-share DAX index in Frankfurt closed up 30.98 at
2,284.86.

<HEADLINE> 3 Hamas Members Withdraw from Palestinian Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Three Hamas activists have
decided to withdraw their nominations for the Palestinian Council
(PC) elections due to be held on January 20, according a
Palestinian source.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Gaza today, Ismail Haniye, Khaled
Al-Hindi and Said Namrouti declared that "due to the eruption of
a state of confusion and our caution of discontinuing such a
state of ambiguity, we decided to revoke our nomination to the
elections."
</P>
<P>
Haniye, Al-Hindi and Namrouti, along with another Islamic
activist Nasser Muzaini, announced Saturday night that they were
running as independents in the upcoming PC elections.
</P>
<P>
The announcement brought the number of known Hamas officials
running in the elections to four, after Imad Falouji, editor of
the Hamas weekly Al-Watan, declared his candidacy two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
In a response to the issue, Hamas issued a leaflet Monday
dissociating itself from the three candidacies. In addition,
Falouji was "officially thrown out of the Islamic movement" by its
leader abroad soon after his decision to run in the elections.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear yet whether Falouji will also withdraw his
nomination.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Palestinian National Authority and Hamas held
reconciliation talks in Cairo to pave the way for the
participation of Hamas in the PC elections.
</P>
<P>
However, the talks failed because of the differences between
the two sides and since then Hamas has announced that it would
boycott the first Palestinian elections in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.

ALGIERS, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Algerian army troops and
security forces have managed to kill more than 100 terrorists
during crackdown operations over the past two days, said security
sources today.
</P>
<P>
The security forces also found large quantities of arms,
ammunition, as well as materials used for manufacturing grenades
and explosives, in the possession of those terrorists.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement released today by security services,
Larbi Mezrag, believed to be the second-ranking leader of the
Islamic Salvation Army, has turned himself in to the authorities
in the region of Jijel.
</P>
<P>
A security official announced recently that since the November
16 presidential elections, more than 1,000 penitent terrorists
have surrendered following the government's offer to pardon armed
militants who gave themselves up to authorities.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Salvation Army is the armed branch of Algeria's
largest opposition group.
</P>
<P>
Some 40,000 people have died in a civil war in Algeria during

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Speaker Refuses to Stop Guerrilla Attacks before Israeli Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese House Speaker Nabih
Berri stressed today a refusal to cool the atmosphere in south
Lebanon before the Israeli pullout, promising that the guerrilla
attacks in the south will stop when Israel withdraws.
</P>
<P>
In a dialogue with local reporters in his office, the Shiite
house speaker reiterated that the resistance is a result of the
Israeli occupation, and "when the occupation is terminated, the
resistance will stop."
</P>
<P>
Berri is also the Secretary General of the pro-Syrian Amal
Movement, a moderate Shiite group which launches sporadic attacks
at Israeli targets in south Lebanon, in an attempt to break a
monopolization in the resistance by Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or
Party of God.
</P>
<P>
"A suggestion to cool the atmosphere before the withdrawal
means reaching an agreement before the liberation, means stopping
our legal right of resistance before the liberation, and this is
refused." the house speaker said.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question on the prospect of the peace process,
Berri pointed to an alternation in Israel's words after the
assassination of former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin,
saying that a seriousness of these words still need more
observation.
</P>
<P>
"It is undoubted that there is a different Israeli language
after the killing of Rabin, but it is still a question how
serious this language is, and to what an extent this can be
realized," he underlined.
</P>
<P>
"For this reason what we can rely on is the resistance, no
more no less."

LONDON, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of homes throughout the
United Kingdom were flooded on Monday as the Christmas freeze gave
way to a dramatic thaw, bursting water mains and domestic water
systems.
</P>
<P>
Local press reported today that in Strathclyde, Scotland,
500,000 homes suffered burst pipes at some point over the holiday.
</P>
<P>
Although engineers worked non-stop to restore mains supplies,
many people returning from holiday breaks to flooded homes could
only switch off their supply at the street mains.
</P>
<P>
Water rationing was introduced in parts of Northern Ireland as
reservoirs ran low because of water leaks and burst pipes. More
than 100,000 homes were affected and water tankers were being used
in some areas.
</P>
<P>
Millions of gallons have been lost through burst pipes
following the coldest December on record, during which
temperatures in some areas fell below -20C.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Election Campaign Starts in West Bank, Gaza </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian Central
Election Commission (CEC) based in the West Bank town of Ramallah
this afternoon announced that the election campaign officially
started today.
</P>
<P>
The date was put ahead of schedule from January 5 following
complaints from the European Union Electoral Unit (EUEU), which is
monitoring the elections, and some candidates for the Palestinian
Council about the short election campaign period.
</P>
<P>
Candidates are asked to contact their District Election
Offices (DEO) to obtain the list of locations where the election
campaign is permitted to be conducted, Mohammad Shtayyeh, General
Secretary of the CEC, told reporters in Ramallah following an
afternoon CEC session.
</P>
<P>
He also said that candidates in Jerusalem are asked to
contact the DEO in east Jerusalem's Abu Dis, where scores
of Palestinian policemen have already been deployed.
</P>
<P>
Shtayyeh said that all these measures were taken in order to
provide candidates with every opportunity possible to launch a
successful campaign and to ensure the democratic nature of the
elections.
</P>
<P>
The exact balloting for the 88-member Palestinian Council and
its chairman will be held on January 20 throughout the West Bank
and the Gaza Strip. The voters must be 18-year-old or above.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, following the EUEU's accusations of
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) irregularities concerning
the elections, the CEC met with an EUEU delegation led by Carl
Lidbom.
</P>
<P>
Shtayyeh told Lidbom what the CEC was concerned about the
first and foremost "is the unity of the Palestinian people."
</P>
<P>
Shtayyeh explained that the PNA wanted to allow time for some
of the national and Islamic groups to reconsider participation in
the elections. Therefore, the CEC was formed only on December 22
after the PNA-Hamas negotiations in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the CEC today released the results of the
first-stage registration figures from the 16 districts from
November 12 until December 2. All Palestinians over 17 were
called upon to register as potential voters.
</P>
<P>
The registration contains a total of 1,048,756 people over
17, including 35,000 youngsters who will not reach 18 until
January 20. Therefore, the total number of eligible voters at
present stands at 1,013,235, 49 percent of whom are women.
</P>
<P>
Hebron boasts 121,983 registered eligible voters, the largest
number, followed by Gaza City with 120,483, Nablus 111,020, and
east Jerusalem 76,400.
</P>
<P>
A second phase of registration is still in progress until
January 4.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Troops Establish Bases in Northern Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE January 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. troops of the peace
implementation force (IFOR) began today to build a network of
military bases in northern Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. contingent would establish a total of 14 bases around
Tuzla, the headquarters of the 20,000-strong U.S. IFOR troops, the
commander of the U.S. division in Tuzla General William Nash said.
</P>
<P>
It will take the U.S. troops, the nucleus of NATO-led 60,000
IFOR, two more months to complete their deployment in northern
Bosnia, Tanjug news agency quoted Nash as saying.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. troops with heavy weapons are responsible for
patrolling the Serb-held areas in northern Bosnia, particularly
the sensitive Posavina corridor linking Serb territories in the
east and west.
</P>
<P>
Serbs demand that the corridor widened, which was strongly
against by the Muslim-Croat federation, and the key town of Brcko
in the corridor was subject to international arbitration.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the deployment of the IFOR troops are continuing
these days despite bad weather in the Balkans. U.S. troops
spokesman Major Tom Moyer said 50 vehicles crossed the pontoon
bridge on the Sava river on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Snow, rain and flood have slowed down the laying of the
600-meter-long pontoon which was finally completed on Sunday after
days of delay.
</P>
<P>
The bridge provides a vital link in a military corridor
stretching from U.S. supply bases in Germany to the headquarters
in Tuzla.
</P>
<P>
An officer of U.S. troops said today hundreds of troops, tanks
and armored vehicles would drive through Croatia to cross the
bridge in the next few days into Bosnia.

<HEADLINE> Peres Doubts Quick Breakthrough in Talks with Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres today expressed his doubt over a quick breakthrough in the
peace negotiations with Syria in the near future, Israel Radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting of the Labor Party's parliamentary group
here, Peres said that for the time being, the atmosphere for
resolving problems with Syria has not been achieved.
</P>
<P>
Peres suggested to wait for the return of the Israeli
negotiation team from the U.S., where it is currently engaged in
talks with the Syrians.
</P>
<P>
Peres said that he did not know if there will be concrete
results.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Syria resumed their peace negotiations on December
27 at the Wye River Conference Center outside Washington, and the
first three days of talks ended last Friday with no statement
issued.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials, however, said that "serious work has been
done in a very positive atmosphere."
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Syrian negotiation teams are due to hold their
second three-day talks Wednesday, which will be followed by
another shuttle visit by U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher between Israel and Syria on January 10.
</P>
<P>
Christopher will discuss with Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad and Peres on the results of the Israeli-Syrian peace
talks.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Manufacturing Sector Still In Trouble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The Commercial Bank of Zimbabwe
(CBZ) today said that business optimism in the manufacturing
sector is still at its lowest ebb despite recent widespread
rains.
</P>
<P>
The bank said in its economic review there were no hopes that
the manufacturing sector, which accounts for about 25 percent of
the country's gross domestic product, would recover in the
medium-term.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that the average manufacturing output during
1995 downed to its lowest level since the introduction of market
reforms in 1990.
</P>
<P>
High input costs and lack of domestic demand constituted
another major problem for the same problem, according to the
review.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the First Merchant Bank of the country said in its
own analysis that production volume statistics for the first
eight months of 1995 showed that half the manufacturing
sub-sectors saw production volumes fall to or below the levels
recorded in 1980.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 2 (Xinhua) -- One group called "Direct Action
Against Drug" admitted today that it committed the murder of a man
on Monday night in Lurgan, County Armagh, Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
According to a BBC TV report this afternoon, the 31-year-old
victim was shot in the chest while sitting in a car with his
girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
Police in Northern Ireland believed that this victim was in
connection with the illegal drug trade and that the "Direct Action
Against Drug" group was a flag of convenience for the Irish
Republic Army (IRA).
</P>
<P>
The security spokesman for the Ulster Unionist Party Ken
Maginnis condemned the IRA-style killings, claiming that the IRA
intended to return to violence.

<HEADLINE> UK Ulster Secretary Says NO Deals with Ulster Unionists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Ulster Secretary Sir
Patrick Mayhew said today that the government will make no deals
with Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), despite the Tories' dwindling
majority in the House of Commons.
</P>
<P>
On December 29, a former Tory parliament member Emma Nicholson
defected to the second largest opposition Liberal Democrats. Her
defection reduced the government's majority in the parliament to
five.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Tory government has now to rely on the
UUP which enjoys nine seats in the parliament for its survival.
</P>
<P>
And the UUP threw a crucial lifeline to the government last
weekend by declaring that they would not back the Opposition
Labour in any confidence of vote in the Commons.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with BBC TV, Mayhew said, "What we are about is
helping the people of Northern Ireland to reach a political
settlement based on consent" of the majority in the province.
</P>
<P>
He said that even-handed approach to the peace process in
Northern Ireland would continue despite the reduction in the
government's majority.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's wheat producers have
described the prevailing weather conditions in the country as
''encouraging'' but expressed cautious optimism on weather.
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive of the Zimbabwe Cereal Producers' Association
Peter Wells today said that it was still very early to gauge the
impact of the current rains on wheat production this season.
</P>
<P>
He added that there was low rainfall in some of the major
wheat-producing areas.
</P>
<P>
Before the onset of the rains, wheat production was expected
to be reduced by two thirds compared with last year mainly owing
to a lack of irrigation water.
</P>
<P>
According to last month's food security report by the Early
Warning Unit of the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC),
Zimbabwe had a wheat shortage of 242,000 tonnes in the 1995/96
season.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe may have to import over 300,000 tonnes of wheat to
augment domestic supplies, the report said. enditem

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T to Cut 40,000 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 2 (Xinhua) -- AT&AMP;T, the giant American
telecommunications company, announced today that it will cut
nearly 40,000 jobs in the process of splitting itself into three
separate companies.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, about 30,000 of the jobs will be cut through
layoffs and another 10,500 will be eliminated through voluntary
severance and divestitures. About 70 percent of the work will be
done within 1996.
</P>
<P>
The largest U.S. Telecommunications firm announced in last
September a plan to break into three pieces in an intensified
competition, spawning a company in telecommunications equipment
and a computers maker.
</P>
<P>
The communications services business, which includes long
distance, cellular service and credit-card calling, will retain
the AT&AMP;T name. Names for the others have not yet been selected.
</P>
<P>
As part of the plan, it announced in last November to buy out
77,800 of its supervisory employees, half of its supervisory
force, by January 13.
</P>
<P>
AT&AMP;T has been cutting back for 10 years. Since its first
breakup in 1984 against becoming a regulated monopoly in the
telecommunications business, its work force has shrunk to 302,000
from 373,000. However its revenues have grown from 60 billion U.S.
dollars to 75 billion dollars.

NICOSIA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government is
considering an increased foreign involvement in the drive for a
settlement of the Cyprus issue, pinning hope on Europe and the
five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council to exert
pressure on the Greek Cypriot side, a government spokesman said
today.
</P>
<P>
Yiannakis Cassoulides, the spokesman, said in his daily press
briefing that the forthcoming visit by a Chinese delegation would
be of help to the settlement.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation, led by Deputy Foreign Minister Tian
Zengpei, will arrive in Cyprus on January 3.
</P>
<P>
The visit by the Chinese delegation follows other visits by
delegations from the U.S., Britain, Russia and France.
</P>
<P>
"We believe there will be more foreign involvement and
increased efforts to help push the peace process forward," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Italian Deputy Foreign Minister Emanuele Scamacca will be in
Cyprus from January 4-6. He is expected to announce the
appointment of an European Union (EU) coordinator for the Cyprus
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides said all issues are on the negotiating table. "We
are ready to negotiate through the process of shuttle diplomacy,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
The year 1995 witnessed a stalemate in the peace talks
between the two communities on this East Mediterranean island,
which was divided in 1974 when Turkish troops invaded it following
an Athens-backed coup.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and international community are currently making
efforts to bring the two communities' leaders to a negotiation
table as a step towards a peaceful solution to the protracted
Cyprus problem.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Gangs in UK Active in Drug Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Up to 20 Turkish gangs in Britain
are running multi-million pound heroin rackets, causing increasing
concern among police and customs officers, the Independent
newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Stretching from London to Glasgow, the gangs are believed to be
one of Britain's fastest emerging organized crime groups, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Customs officers seized more than a ton of heroin -- worth 90
million pounds (140 million US dollars) -- this year from Turkish
traffickers, which is twice the quantity discovered in 1994 in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
In one raid on a warehouse in north-east London earlier this
year, 190 Kg of heroin was discovered, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The gangs are also involved in murders, smuggling illegal
immigrants, extorting money through protection rackets and
counterfeiting.

NICOSIA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- A heavy rain that lasted until
today is expected to relieve a severe drought the East
Mediterranean island had suffered.
</P>
<P>
The island experienced one of the driest Decembers on record,
which prompted Archbishop Chrysostomos to hold on New Year's eve
a special prayer for rain, a practice which is not unusual during
dry periods.
</P>
<P>
The head of the Meteorological Service, Kleanthis Filaniotis,
said that the rain, which began Monday and continued today across
the island is very beneficial to agriculture and livestock,
provided that it will continue.
</P>
<P>
The rainy weather is expected to continue until Friday
while snow is also expected to fall tonight on the highest
peaks of the Troodos Mountains.
</P>
<P>
Rainfall in December 1995 has been the lowest in the past 30

Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets announced here
today.
</P>
<P>
Soskovets told a news conference that total investments in

Soskovets said that 65 percent of the government investments
will go to housing, public health, science and culture, especially
the pharmaceutical and power industries.

MOSCOW, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Russia's presidential economic
aide Alexander Livshits said today that the new limits set by the
government on currency exchanges are necessary for the country's
economic security.
</P>
<P>
New limits of the currency exchange belt between 4,550 and
5,150 roubles against the U.S. dollar became effective as of the
New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
Livshits told the Itar-Tass news agency that the 600-rouble
spread between the lower and upper levels is very important
because consideration should be given to economic expediency and
reason.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that a currency exchange belt is a
provisional measure. "All depends on how the situation will
develop and what domestic inflation we shall have."
</P>
<P>
Russia introduced the first currency exchange belt in July 5,
1995 with a 4,300-4,900 spread against the dollar.

AMMAN, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's Foreign Minister Abdul
Karim Kabariti announced here today that King Hussein will pay
an official visit to Israel on January 10.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by Radio Jordan, Kabariti made the

<HEADLINE> Iranian Extremists Threaten to Launch Anti-US Campaign across World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Iran's extremists today
threatened to attack the U.S. interests anywhere in the world if
the U.S. continues to engage itself in any action against Iran.
</P>
<P>
Hussein Allah Karam, the leader of Ansar Hezbollah, told a
group of former veterans at an anti-US rally that if they
are granted a permission by Iran's Supreme Leader Ali
Khamenei, they would start operations against the U.S. interests
anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
Some 3,000 people today staged an anti-US rally here to protest
Washington against its 20 million dollar covert-action aimed to
destabilize the Islamic regime.
</P>
<P>
Amid slogans of "Down with USA," a young man said at the rally
"we are ready to attack US Fifth Fleet in the Persian Gulf in a
kamikaze way."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Strait of Hormuz through which two thirds of
the world's oil supply reaches markets, Karam said that the
Moslems in the world have control of the "important bottlenecks"
in the world.
</P>
<P>
"The Islamic Republic has tied our hands because it wants to
respect the international norms, but if our religious leader
allows us, we will put an end to the American domination," he
told his followers.
</P>
<P>
His emotional speech was interrupted by the crowd chanting
"The Persian Gulf is the Grave of the Great Satan."
</P>
<P>
Karam claimed that the U.S. has spent 3 billion dollars
every year to topple the Tehran government.
</P>
<P>
Ansar Hezbollah, a group of university students who are former
veterans of the war, has a radical agenda and is fiercely loyal to
Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
Karam attacked those who had a soft stance on the relations
with the United States.
</P>
<P>
The rally started from the al-Javad Mosque at 7th Tir Square at
14:00 local time, and marched four kilometers towards the
U. N. mission in Tehran in protest against U.S. interference in
Iran's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration concluded by burning an empty coffin
covered by an American flag. Karam said the coffin represented
the death of American influence around the world.
</P>
<P>
The coffin was taken to a roof-top near the UN building,
set ablaze and then thrown into the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
Student activism has played an important role in the Iranian
history. The downfall of the Shah was caused by the unrest at the
university. The taking of 52 American hostages and their 444 days
of captivity were masterminded by Tehran University students.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati wrote a
strongly worded letter to the UN against what he described as the
blatant proof of American state terrorism and asked the world body
to denounce Washington's act.
</P>
<P>
On the first day of 1996, Iran claimed it will lodge a protest
with the U.N. and the International Court of Justice if
Washington does not reject the congressional act against the
Islamic republic.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the war of words between the
Clinton administration and the Tehran government are flaring
up. The relations between Iran and U.S. are going through a
more stormy period.
</P>
<P>
However, observers and diplomats here do not predict any
likelihood of military confrontation between the two countries for
the time being.

MANILA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government today
downplayed reports on terrorist disruption or sabotage of the
forthcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting
scheduled for November in the country.
</P>
<P>
Interior and Local Government Secretary Rafael Alunan said, "We

Since January 1995, police have arrested 35 foreign nationals
who were suspected to be engaged in terrorism and other illegal
activities in the country.
</P>

Alunan said that the growing threat of transnational terrorism
must be contained within the shortest time possible.

During the APEC meeting, he said that the government's internal
security apparatus will continue to be on alert for possible
reprisals from domestic and foreign terrorists on account of their

<P>
MANILA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The Energy Regulatory Board (ERB)
announced a three-centavo (25 pesos equal 1 US dollar) increase in
the prices of all petroleum products effective at 6:00 p.m. today
</P>
<P>
The three-centavo (0.03 peso) per liter adjustment was due to
the implementation of the expanded value-added tax (E-Vat).
</P>
<P>
The ERB said that impact of the price hikes on petroleum
products, including transportation fare and charges on
electricity, will be very minimal and it will not even affect the
consuming public.
</P>
<P>
However, the increase is apart from the oil price hikes being
asked by the country's three big oil firms to replenish the oil
price stabilization fund (OPSF).
</P>
<P>
As of last October, the OPSF registered a deficit of over 6
billion pesos (240 million US dollars).

<HEADLINE> Russia's Efforts to Curb Oil Spill Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Russian workers
continue to contain a serious oil spill in southern Russia,
catching less than 15 of the 100 tons of oil leaked in the past
seven days, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The spill, 100 meters wide and three kilometers long, is moving
under the ice of the Belaya River and difficult to control.
</P>
<P>
The spill, if going on unchecked, could spread to the larger
Kama River, the Volga River and even the Caspian Sea.
</P>
<P>
Crude oil began leaking last Wednesday from an aged section of
the Nurlino-Novosibirsk pipeline, about 15 meters from the Belaya
River and near the southern Ural city of Ufa, which is roughly
1,000 kilometers from Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The spillage has polluted the drinking water in dozens of
cities and villages in the southern Ural Mountains, and water was
so badly polluted that schools in the area had to be closed.
</P>
<P>
Workers were slow to react to the disaster occurred during
Russia's long New Year's holiday, Itar-Tass said. Their work was
further held back by Britain-made machines which failed to operate
in the severe winter weather.
</P>
<P>
The Nurlino-Novosibirsk pipeline has been in operation for some
36 years. Experts said that Russia's aging pipeline network has
been plagued by leaks and accidents, the worst of which happened
in Komi in 1994.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, January 2 (Xinhua) -- School dropouts have become a
serious social problem in Romania, a local newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The daily newspaper Curierul National quoted the government's
just-released "White Paper: Educational Reform in Romania" as
saying that only 90 percent children attended school in the
1994-1995 period.
</P>
<P>
Attendance rate fell when age rose. It was 95 percent for
children aged 7-10, 89 percent for those aged 12-13, and 60
percent for the 14-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
The main reason was that some low-income families with more
children wanted their kids to start working early.
</P>
<P>
The government has taken a series of measures to reduce school
dropouts. Poor families will be entitled to welfare only when
their children are attending school, and parents will be punished
if their children remain dropouts.
</P>
<P>
Romania offers free education up to eight years for all
school-age children.

<HEADLINE> Human Rights Improvements in China Hailed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese people enjoy
improved human rights, not only economically, but also
politically, socially and culturally, Zhu Muzhi, president of the
Human Rights Society of China, said today.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on China's human rights conditions, Zhu told a dozen
reporters here that the country has made marked progress in those
areas, that there are still some problems, and that China is
exerting efforts to make more improvements.
</P>
<P>
"It is extremely unfair and vicious when some foreigners
portray China as a country with poor human rights, and denying its
great achievements in human rights," Zhu said, pointing out that
some people just take a one-sided approach to some problems or
confuse right and wrong.
</P>
<P>
He attributed China's achievements to the fact it has advocated
human rights in accord with the pressing needs and interests of
the Chinese people, who are anxious about problems of food and
clothing.
</P>
<P>
"the people are familiar with the real conditions of their own
country and their own needs to the greatest degree, so it is easy
for them to find the correct way to improve their human rights
situation," Zhu Muzhi told the reporters.
</P>
<P>
Those who call themselves human rights defenders and impose
their views or methods of human rights on others for a certain
purpose, while completely neglecting the actual conditions of a
country and the needs of its people, are virtually destroyers of
human rights, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made a point of saying that the core of political power is
democracy and that China's stable political situation and bustling
economic growth show that the government is doing things
completely in accord with the interests of the people.
</P>
<P>
As for Wei Jingsheng's case, Zhu pointed out that it is China's
sovereign right to try a criminal and guard the sanctity of the
law, and that no other country has the right to interfere. Some
people in the United States simply want to delay China's rapid
development under the guise of protecting human rights, he said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that in the future, it is imperative for China to
improve the living conditions of its people, particularly to bring
the 70 million people out of poverty, while increasing overseas
exchanges to reduce misunderstanding.

<HEADLINE> Malaysians Urged To Use Port Klang Fully </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad today urged Malaysian importers and exporters to
fully use Port Klang to reduce the deficit in the country's
balance of payment, which stood at 18 billion Malaysian Ringgit
(about 7.2 billion US dollars) in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said his government wanted to see Port Klang handling
all the imports and exports of Malaysia. Noting that Malaysia
might not be able to achieve this 100 percent, he said the country
would certainly work towards this goal.
</P>
<P>
"This has become more important today simply because the
deficit in the balance of payment is growing, and one of the
contributor to the deficit is the fact that our invisible trade
accrues largely to foreign countries and not to Malaysia," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launching of the first direct container service
from Port Klang to the United States, Mahathir said: "It is
therefore reasonable to expect us to make more use of our ports,
if possible our own ships and our own insurance companies."
</P>
<P>
"The government will do everything possible to see that
Malaysian goods are directed to Port Klang so that there will be
sufficient amount of goods and containers to fill the huge ships
so that their visits here are worthwhile," the prime minister
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the government's plan, Port Klang, about 40 km
west of the capital city of Kuala Lumpur, will be developed as the
main port of this country and even one of the biggest in the
region.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to make Port Klang more attractive, the government has
decided to make it a free port where goods can come here and be
re-exported without being taxed at all if they do not cross the
customs barrier.

<HEADLINE> Ideal Money Supply Growth Suggested at 16 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 2 (Xinhua) -- China's economic growth can
accommodate a 16 percent increase in its money supply annually,
according to Wang Tongsan, a professor with the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
"This is the proper rate that can be digested by economic
expansion and will not result in serious inflation," Wang said,
drawing the conclusion from a series of economic studies.
</P>
<P>
China's inflation averaged 6.8 percent annually, between 1980
and 1993, during which time the money supply grew 24.3 percent a
year, according to the professor.
</P>
<P>
The increase in broad money (M2), or currency in circulation
plus demand and term deposits, was about seven percentage points
higher than necessary, leaving an annualized inflation rate of 6.8
percent, he explained.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Opposition Movement Proposes Talks for  Transfer of Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 2 (Xinhua) - The National Islamic Movement
led by General Rashid Dostum has proposed to hold talks between
the Kabul government of President Burhanuddin Rabbani and the
rival warring groups for transfer of power in war-torn
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"We have proposed to representatives of Rabbani and Taliban to
hold negotiations to agree on an individual, acceptable to all
groups, to take over power from Rabbani and then hold
consultations for future mechanism," said Dostum's representative
Maulvi Turkistani here today.
</P>
<P>
He said the proposed "individual" should be "moderate and not a
fundamentalist."
</P>
<P>
The proposed person should meet representatives from across the
country to evolve a mechanism for the future government, he added.
</P>
<P>
The National Islamic Movement is part of a 4-party Afghan
opposition alliance which includes Hezb-i-Islami led by Gulbuddin
Hekmatyar, National Liberation Movement led by former President
Sibghatollah Mojaddedi and Karim Khalili's Hizb-i-Wahdat.
</P>
<P>
"In principle, none of the Afghan groups have opposed our
suggestion," Turkistani said.
</P>
<P>
He said the opposition alliance is ready to talk with the Kabul
regime "only if Rabbani resigns."
</P>
<P>
Rabbani recently sent a high-ranking delegation to
Mazar-i-Sharif, Dostum's stronghold in northern Afghanistan, to
pave the way for Rabbani's visit to the city following Rabbani's
offer to go in person to the headquarters of Dostum and the
Taliban Islamic student militia for talks.
</P>
<P>
Turkistani said that his group could not receive Rabbani in
Mazar-i-Sharif as president of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
There is a consensus among the opposition parties that Rabbani
must step down to pave the way for talks, he added.

<HEADLINE> Ideal Money Supply Growth Suggested at 16 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 2 (Xinhua) -- China's economic growth can
accommodate a 16 percent increase in its money supply annually,
according to Wang Tongsan, a professor with the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
"This is the proper rate that can be digested by economic
expansion and will not result in serious inflation," Wang said,
drawing the conclusion from a series of economic studies.
</P>
<P>
China's inflation averaged 6.8 percent annually, between 1980
and 1993, during which time the money supply grew 24.3 percent a
year, according to the professor.
</P>
<P>
The increase in broad money (M2), or currency in circulation
plus demand and term deposits, was about seven percentage points
higher than necessary, leaving an annualized inflation rate of 6.8
percent, he explained.

<HEADLINE> Wuhan Attracts More Foreign Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Foreign banks have been
enthusiastic about setting up agencies or branch offices in Wuhan,
capital city of central China's Hubei Province since the central
authorities agreed to open local financial industry to foreign
financial institutions a year ago.
</P>
<P>
One major French bank, Societe Generale, has formally applied
to upgrade its representative office in the city to an operational
branch, according to Wang Wanfei, an official with the Wuhan
Branch of the People's Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
The Hongkong-based Bank of East Asia has expressed the same
intention, Wang added.
</P>
<P>
Societe Generale's interest in opening up a branch bank in
Wuhan is partly due to the facts that Hubei Province is an
important destination of French investment in China and the
biggest existing Sino-French venture is being built in Wuhan, said
the French bank's Wuhan office representative.
</P>
<P>
However, Wuhan's strong appeal to foreign banks lies in its
geographic advantage and strategic importance, noted an official
of the Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank of Japan.
</P>
<P>
Wuhan is on the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, along
which thrives China's most promising local economies including
Shanghai and its Pudong New Area. As China switches development
focus from the east coastal areas to the central and western
parts, Wuhan as the hub of the south-north communications and
transportation can be the springboard to the central and the west.
</P>
<P>
What is more, said the Japanese bank official, the
multi-billion Three-Gorges Dam project is located in Hubei
Province, which is about to bring enormous chances to foreign
financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Over the past months, a dozen of foreign banks including
Citibank of the United States and the ABN AMRO Bank of Holland
have sent officials to Wuhan with the desire to set up
representative offices in the city, Wang Wanfei said.
</P>
<P>
Wang is optimistic about the local financial development. Up to
date, Wuhan has more than 2,000 financial institutions. Its
short-term capital market and the securities market ranks second
and the third, respectively, in China.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the Societe Generale of France, the East Asia Bank
from Hong Kong, the Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank of Japan and the
Industrial Bank of Japan have representative offices in
Wuhan.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Prices of many commodities and

KAMPALA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has worked out a
children's law to force parents to properly feed, clothe and
educate their children, said the local daily "The New Vision"

<HEADLINE> S. Africans Lack Of Nutritional Knowledge, Say Researchers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 2 (Xinhua)-- Smoking and over
consumption of alcoholic drinks made South Africans a
lack-of-nutrition people, researchers said here today.
</P>
<P>
"Most South Africans did not eat properly," said researchers
from the National Medical Research Council in a domestic survey
of eating habits of 2000 adults of different races and from both
urban and rural areas in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The survey, published in the latest version of the South
African Journal of Science, said poverty was not the main reason.
</P>
<P>
Only 13 percent of the people investigated drank enough milk
to give them sufficient calcium. Only 25 percent ate enough fruit
and vegetables. And most of them used a form of margarine which
is high in fatty acids that are believed to increase blood
cholesterol, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
The researchers found that the intake of micro-nutrients, such
as calcium, zinc and various vitamins, was low throughout the
country.
</P>
<P>
"The shortage of micro-nutrients showed up in the mixed diet
of both the white and the black people, as well as the
maize-based diet of blacks," said the researchers.
</P>
<P>
Though poverty is one of the reasons in the low intake of
milk, fruit, vegetables, over-consumption of alcoholic drinks
contributed about 15 percent of the total energy intake of urban
black adults and about 21 percent of urban colored adults, said
the report.

<HEADLINE> Strong Demand Expected for Portable PCs in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Demand for Notebook personal
computers (PCs) in domestic market in fiscal 1996 starting April
is expected to reach some 2.6 million units, an increase of about
65 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The growth will be the highest among various types, Kyodo News
Service quoted the Japan Electronic Industry Development
Association as saying today.
</P>
<P>
The association said that during the April-September period
last year, overall PC shipments were 2.43 million units.
</P>
<P>
The association predicted that domestic demand shipments reach
5.2 million units in fiscal 1995 ending in March and 7.5 million
in fiscal 1996.
</P>
<P>
Reasons for strong portable PC demand are that PC makers are
expected to unveil lower-priced, higher-performance notebook PC
models and greater use of digital mobile telephones.
</P>
<P>
The internet global PC communication network is also expected
to spur demand for easy-to-carry portable PCs, according to the
association.

<HEADLINE> First Chinese National Rules on B-Shares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The State Council today released
China's first set of national rules on the B-shares.
</P>
<P>
China previously had two separate sets of regulations on
B-shares formulated by the People's Bank of China and local
authorities in Shanghai and Shenzhen, home of the country's only
stock exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Joint stock companies, with approval from the Securities
Committee of the State Council, can issue B-shares: shares listed
domestically, denominated in Chinese currency, but traded in
foreign currencies, according to new rules.
</P>
<P>
The value of the shares is figured in yuan, but they are
underwritten and traded in foreign currencies and listed on
securities exchanges in China, according to the rules.
</P>
<P>
They also say that B-shares are available for foreign legal
persons or institutions, for individuals, legal persons, and
institutions in Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, for Chinese citizens
living outside China, and for other persons permitted by the
Securities Committee.
</P>
<P>
The Securities Committee and China Securities Regulatory
Commission are the two bodies responsible for the issuing and
trading of B-shares and for related affairs, according to the new
rules, which explain that only companies that observe state
policies on fixed-asset investment and the use of foreign capital,
are qualified to issue the shares.
</P>
<P>
The rules say that capital raised from B-shares must be used in
accordance with state industrial policies and the sponsor of
shares must underwrite a minimum of 35 percent of the total amount.
</P>
<P>
They also say that at least 25 percent of a company's total
shares should be available to the public. The figure can be
reduced to 15 percent if the capital value of the total shares
reaches 400 million yuan (about 48 million US dollars). Companies
that issue B-shares must have a foreign exchange account at a bank
inside China that is authorized to deal in foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
Dividends and other payments to holders of B-shares must be
quoted in yuan and paid in foreign currency, and can be remitted
to outside China after taxes.
</P>
<P>
The rules contain 28 clauses and cover a wide range of items
related to B-class shares.

<HEADLINE> Iran Stages Anti-US Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Some 3,000 Iranians staged here
today an anti-US rally to protest Washington's 20 million dollar
covert-action aimed at destabilizing the Islamic regime.
</P>
<P>
Amid slogans of "Down with USA," a young man said at the rally
"we are ready to attack the U.S. Fifth Fleet in the Persian Gulf
in a kamikaze way."
</P>
<P>
Addressing demonstrators, mostly university students, another
man, challenging the United States to fight, said, "The trench of
the revolution is the three islands."
</P>
<P>
He said that the Islamic Republic is not afraid of U.S. atomic
bombs.
</P>
<P>
Various organizations and associations had called on the people
to turn out in large numbers for the rally against the
U.S. subversive actions against Iran.
</P>
<P>
However, observers here noted that the number of people in the
rally is not as large as some Iranian organizations had expected.
</P>
<P>
The rally started from the Al-Javad Mosque at 7th Tir Square
at 14:00 hours local time (1030 GMT), and marched four kilometers
toward the United Nations Mission in Tehran to voice protest
against American interference in Iran's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati wrote a
strongly worded letter to the U.N. against the blatant proof of
U.S. state terrorism and asked the world body to denounce
Washington's act.
</P>
<P>
On the first day of 1996, Iran claimed it will lodge a protest
with the United Nations and the International Court of Justice if
Washington does not reject the congressional act against the
Islamic republic.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1995, Iran's Parliamentary Speaker Ali Akbar
Nateq-Nouri even called for the allocation of a budget as a
tit-for-tat measure to fight back U.S. covert-action against the
Islamic Republic.
</P>
<P>
But, he did not specify how much he wants to earmark for the
special counter measures.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the war of words between the
Washington administration and the Tehran government is flaring
up. Relations between Iran and the U.S. are going through more
stormy period.
</P>
<P>
They noted that the relations between the United States and
Islamic Republic seem to be much more intense as both sides are
preparing the presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
However, observers and diplomats here do not see any
likelihood of military confrontation between U.S. forces and
Iranian forces at present.

<HEADLINE> S. African Blacks More Optimistic About Future Than Other Groups </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 2 (Xinhua)-- South Africa's blacks are
more optimistic about the future than other race groups, a survey
said here today.
</P>
<P>
A probability study of "inflationary perceptions" showed that
more black South Africans believe that prices are lower than they
were a year ago, despite a widespread perception across the
racial divide that prices are general higher.
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted by Market Research Africa (MRA) upon 2502
urban households, represent about 92 percent of the urban adult
population, and about 53 percent of the total population.
</P>
<P>
The poll dealt with perceptions of costs and respondents were
asked to indicate whether they thought specified goods and
services were cheaper, the same price or more expensive than last
year.
</P>
<P>
The eight categories under investigation are clothes, food,
transport, education, healthcare, rent and housing, electricity
and water.
</P>
<P>
The figures indicate that only half of the black respondents
found education more expensive and 46 percent found healthcare
more expensive than last year, compared to more than 90 percent
of whites and indians. Black respondents also thought rent,
electricity and water costs were lower than last year.
</P>
<P>
However, Indian, coloured and whites interviewed did not think
rents were cheaper, whereas 10 percent of the black respondents
said rents were cheaper this year.
</P>
<P>
In total, 21 percent of black participants saw education as
being cheaper this year, compared to 1 percent of Indians and
whites, and 2 percent of coloureds.
</P>
<P>
The survey had not investigated "why" there should be these
differences between the race groups.
</P>
<P>
"While there is likely to be an element of improved living
standards among blacks, or more awareness of economic trends
among other groups due to their greater exposure to media, the
most likely explanation is simply that there is a general
perception among black South Africans of a brighter future," said
MRA Managing Director Hanna Fourie.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The pace of Britain's economic
growth will slow down in 1996 and business confidence is at its
lowest since 1992, according to two surveys published today.
</P>
<P>
Britain's gross domestic product will grow by less than 2.5
percent in 1996, compared with 2.75 percent last year, Cambridge
Econometrics, an economic consultancy, predicted in a report
released today.
</P>
<P>
The report says that an economic slowdown in the rest of the
world will depress Britain's exports this year.
</P>
<P>
Companies in the country will cut outputs as they try to sell
the stocks they built in 1995, says the report.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a survey by Lloyds Bank also shows that business
confidence is at its lowest level in Britain since the poll was
first conducted in 1992.
</P>
<P>
For the first time, the survey shows an increase in businesses
reporting cash flow problems and a decline in export orders.
</P>
<P>
Orders for goods and services continue to grow, but at the
slowest rate since the second half of 1992, according to the
survey.
</P>
<P>
All this has made companies `somewhat pessimistic' about the
country's economic prospects, the study says.

<HEADLINE> Mass Youth Unemployment Predicted for London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Young people in London will face
mass unemployment in the years ahead and that will lead to further
deepening of economic and social deprivation, a government study
said today.
</P>
<P>
Conducted by one of the government's Training and Enterprise
Councils, the study said that there will be 230,000 fewer jobs in
London by the end of the decade than in 1990 and that young people
will bear the brunt of this collapse in employment.
</P>
<P>
This is because the jobs which young people traditionally hold
are being taken by part-timers or married women returning to work,
or disappear as a result of industrial or technological changes.
</P>
<P>
London and the South East, the study noted, experienced a
deeper downturn than other regions in the recession of the early
1990s, and economic growth is expected to slow again by the end of
the decade, causing further decline in job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Calling mass youth unemployment a real danger, the study urged
the government to take urgent actions to counter the trend by
substantially increasing investment in training and work
experience for young people.

FUZHOU, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The output value of processed
aquatic products in east China's Fujian Province reached 4.5
billion yuan last year, up 27.5 percent over 1994.
</P>
<P>
According to an official with the Provincial Bureau of Aquatic
Products, local companies engaged in processing such aquatic

eel last year, earning 300 million US dollars from export.
</P>
<P>
He said that the province made 200 million yuan from selling
frozen aquatic products in 1995. Fish products, cuisine and other
frozen food enjoyed a brisk market not only at home, but also in
Japan, the United States and some other countries.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Fujian produced 60,000 tons of eel feed and 8,000 tons
of prawn feed, with total output value amounting to 600 million
yuan, or up 50 percent over 1994.

sale of oil to buy foodstuffs and medicines of which it has
suffered a severe shortage. Part of the money will also be used
to pay compensation for the 1991 Gulf war.

But Iraq has so far rejected the resolution on the grounds that
it constitutes a gross infringement on the country's sovereignty.

<HEADLINE> UK Soldier of Next Century to Become "Lethality Man" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The British infantry soldier of
the next century will become a high-tech "lethality man,"
according to a futuristic plan of the Ministry of Defense (MOD).
</P>
<P>
Under a program called Future Fighting Soldier System, the army
is working over ways in which the soldiers can take advantage of
the best military technology without acquiring a doctorate in
Physics and carrying a heavy power pack to keep all the electronic
gadgets working over long periods.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the study, which is being carried out by the Defense
Research Agency, is to ensure soldiers to be armed with the latest
technology not on a piecemeal basis, but as part of an overall
concept.
</P>
<P>
The early version of what the MOD calls "lethality man" focuses
on an integrated fighting system and the first phase of the
research is well under way.
</P>
<P>
The "lethality man" is to be equipped with a helmet-mounted
low-light camera, a head-up display behind a protective visor, and
a rifle with an image-intensifying sight and a laser aimer.
</P>
<P>
The picture in the head-up display will be able to switch
between the camera and the weapon sight.
</P>
<P>
The key element of the research is to provide soldiers in the
field with accurate up-to-date information which will allow him to
outwit the enemy.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the plan will equip the soldiers with digital
mapping and compass, and an equipment to transmit pictures back to
headquarters.

LUSAKA, January 2 (Xinhua)-- Zambian former President Kenneth
Kaunda has vowed to contest for presidency in the gerneral
elections later this year, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda, also President of the opposition United National
Independence Party (UNIP), stressed that neither President
Frederick Chiluba nor his ministers can stop him from running for
the republican presidency.
</P>
<P>
UNIP and other concerned groups will exhaust
non-confrontational methods to prevent the adoption of the draft
constitution through parliament, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He demanded a constituent assembly to adopt the constitution
and added that any other methods will be strongly resisted.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda will be "technically" disqualified to contest the top
post if the constitutional provision for a presidential candidate
to be a second generation Zambian is passed. Though Kaunda was
born in Zambia but his father was a Malawian citizen.
</P>
<P>
" I was born a Zambian, i am a free Zambian and i will die a
Zambian. I declare that nobody will stop me from vying for the
presidency of this country except UNIP," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, President Chiluba said on local television program
recently Kaunda is not a Zambian and will merely be allowed to
live in the country by his government.

<P>
JERUSALEM, January 2 (Xinhua) -- A chief European Union
observer monitoring the Palestinian elections has urged PLO leader
Yasser Arafat to "take urgent steps to try to build public and
international confidence in the election process."
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Monday, Carl Lidbom, head of the European
Union Electoral Unit monitoring the Palestinian elections, said
that irregularities by the Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
are threatening the credibility of the Palestinian elections.
</P>
<P>
Lidbom said that he was disturbed that the Palestinian Central
Election Commission (PCEC) had been set up so late (on December
22).
</P>
<P>
The chief EU observer also criticized the reduction of the
election campaign from 22 days to 14 days, saying that shortening
the campaign "without any explanation breaches the Election Law
and adds to the difficulties of independent candidates."
</P>
<P>
"Overall, the events of the past few days have created
confusion and uncertainty, and give the impression of the
arbitrary use of power to redesign the electoral architecture,"
said Lidbom.
</P>
<P>
The EU monitors believe that "the series of improvisations and
irregularities should now cease if the forthcoming elections are
to retain any credibility," he added.
</P>
<P>
So far, there has been no immediate response from the PCEC.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian Elections are set to be held on January 20.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Inaugurates Atomic Research Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani today inaugurated an atomic research center in the
capital of Tehran, Iran's official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
But the agency did not specify which country provided the
facilities for the center of research and application of new
energies.
</P>
<P>
According to IRNA, Reza Amrollahi, head of the Atomic Energy
Organization (AEO), briefed the president on the progress of AEO
projects.
</P>
<P>
He said that the first nuclear power plant of the country is to
go on stream by the end of the second five-year development plan
(1995-1999).
</P>
<P>
A senior Russian diplomat said last month that Iran's
1,000-megawatt nuclear power project in Bushehr, north of the
Persian Gulf, was postponed to 1996 from December 1995.
</P>
<P>
Georgy Matchitidze, Counselor of the Russian Embassy in Tehran,
told Xinhua in an exclusive interview that the postponement was
made due to money problem in Iran and elections in Russia.
</P>
<P>
Iran has extended only 60 million U.S. dollars to Russia for
the cost of feasibility study for the project, the diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
"We should need at least 50 million dollars more to start
construction of the project because we have to purchase equipment
and related facilities of the plant," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said Russian specialists would come to Iran start building
the nuclear power plant in January if Iran pays the money.
</P>
<P>
Most of Russian specialists had returned to Russia after they
completed the feasibility study, he said, adding that there are
now only seven to eight Russian physicists in Iran.
</P>
<P>
A well-informed source told Xinhua in November that Iran had
opened two letters of credit totaling 80 million U.S. dollars on
the nuclear power plant to be built by Russian specialists in
Bushehr.
</P>
<P>
The Russian side had threatened to pull out all 160
specialists from the Bushehr nuclear power plant if the Iranian
government did not open the letters of credit, the source said.
</P>
<P>
Under a contract, Russia will help Iran complete the Bushehr
nuclear power plant in southern Iran by supplying equipment and
facilities as well as raw materials such as fuel for operation.

<HEADLINE> Higher Passport Rates To Reduce Number of Malaysians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian prime minister
Mahathir Mohamad said today that the increased rates for
international passports effective since January 1, 1996, was aimed
at reducing the number of Malaysians traveling abroad.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after launching the first direct trans-Pacific service
from Malaysia to the United States, Mahathir said the government
had imposed the new rates after considering the fact that the
number of Malaysians traveling abroad was too large.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that 30 percent of Malaysians were traveling
abroad. "If they still want to go, they will have to pay a little
bit more," Mahathir added.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's immigration department announcing the new rates on
Saturday said that the rates for the international passports valid
for five years have been increased from 60 Malaysian Ringgit
(about 24 US dollars) to 145 Ringgit (about 58 dollars) for 32
pages and from 100 Ringgit (about 40 dollars) to 265 Ringgit
(about 106 dollars) for 64 pages.
</P>
<P>
The department also doubled the monthly levy on foreign workers
working in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir stressed that the new rates would only discourage some
people from traveling abroad. "We cannot stop everybody (from
traveling abroad) but we can at least prevent some from applying
for passports without any plans for travels," the prime minister
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Malaysia's news agency Bernama quoted Malaysian
deputy Home Affairs Minister Megat Junid Megat Ayub as saying that
the government imposed the new rates to reduce the number of
Malaysians vacationing abroad and help towards lowering the
nation's deficit of 7.2 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Syrian Newspaper Expects Peace with Israel in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The resumption of
Syrian-Israeli peace talks has raised hopes that peace could be
achieved in 1996 if goodwill and persistent efforts are
fulfilled, Syria's newspaper Tishrin said today.
</P>
<P>
"Syria does firmly believe that peace is possible and that it
should even develop into an established fact in the region if
Israel complies with relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions
and the land-for-peace principle," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The paper urged Israel to commit itself to a complete and
immediate withdrawal from the Golan Heights, a strategic plateau
captured by the Jewish state in the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
"The withdrawal is the gateway to a genuine, honorable and
overall peace in the region," the paper stressed.
</P>
<P>
Syrian-Israeli peace talks resumed last month amid high hopes
for a breakthrough. But there have been no reports of progress so
far. The two sides will resume talks Wednesday in the American
state of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
In conclusion, Tishrin said that if the end of 1995 saw a
reactivation of the peace process on the Syrian and Lebanese
tracks, the year 1996 should be the year of peace on the Syrian
and Lebanese tracks.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Troops Set up First Forward Base in Northern Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. armored troops started
to set up its first forward base on the confrontation lines in
Bosnia on Monday after crossing the Sava river, according to
reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The first U.S. operations base was established on an old farm
with a crop dusters' airstrip at the village of Gornji Zabar, some
15 kilometers south of the Sava, and right in the middle of the
Posavina corridor, a land road for which the warring Bosnian
factions fought fiercely.
</P>
<P>
The farm was chosen for its crop dusters' landing strip to
accommodate helicopters. Another 15 such fortified forward bases
would be built in the next weeks, from which U.S. troops will
patrol a 4-kilometer wide zone separating warring factions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 148 U.S. military vehicles and tanks as well as 436
troops crossed the Sava river on Sunday, the first day after the
largest pontoon ever built by American army engineers was put into
operation.
</P>
<P>
But U.S. officers said that the traffic had to slow down on
Monday because the floating bridge needed repairing and an
offshore island on which the pontoon was based has turned into a
quagmire and needed consolidation with more gravel.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Foreign Minister Challenged by Liberal Scholar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 2 (Xinhua) -- A controversial Iranian scholar
attacked Iran's foreign minister for making statements that would
further endanger his life in Iran, a local press report said today.
</P>
<P>
The Persian daily Salam reported that Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati told a group of students last week that liberal
thinker Abdolkarim Soroush pursued the same goals as another
controversial thinker Ahmad Kasravi, who was stabbed to death by a
religious zealot in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
Velayati had also said that Soroush was making statements which
had created problems for Iran in the international arena.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Soroush responded to Velayati, saying that he would
never make statements that could be used by the enemies of Iran.
</P>
<P>
Unconfirmed reports here said that Soroush had left Iran and is
now believed to be in Canada.
</P>
<P>
Soroush, who has been at the center-stage of academic debates
on the separation of religion and politics, accused Velayati of
"jumping on the bandwagon" in a massive campaign by the Tehran
government to discredit him.
</P>
<P>
Following the incident of unrest in Tehran University, Iran's
Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei warned that the Islamic Republic will
not tolerate anti-clerical discussions at the university.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Supreme Council on Cultural Revolution even called for
serious punishment for those who disrupt the academic environment
at universities.
</P>
<P>
A British-educated Moslem with a doctorate in pharmacology,
Abolkarim Soroush, also known as Haj-Faraj, was active in the
seventies in the anti-Shah student movement abroad.
</P>
<P>
He returned to Iran after the Islamic Revolution of 1979 and
held some official positions such as membership in the Supreme
Council on Cultural Revolution, before he became a persona non
grata for his views on Islam, pluralism and democracy.

<HEADLINE> Party Chief: Agricultural Cooperatives Should Exist in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The General Secretary of
Vietnamese Communist Party Do Muoi stressed that agricultural
cooperatives are important for the country's industrialization and
therefore should not be dissolved, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
While visiting three northern delta communes last week, Muoi
said it was impossible to carry out the party's industrialization
policies in agricultural and rural areas without having
agricultural cooperatives as the bases.
</P>
<P>
The three northern communes share the same characteristics of
an over-crowded population, high-level intensive farming, and the
development of traditional crafts.
</P>
<P>
Muoi said it was advisable to better exploit local potential to
broaden handicraft production and accumulate capital.

MANILA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines and Singapore are
vying to host the business council secretariat of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) which aims to create a free trade area
encompassing 18 members by the year 2020.
</P>

Manila and Singapore were cited as the two possible sites for
the private sector advisory group to the APEC.
</P>
<P>
To strengthen its bid, the Philippine government has launched a

President Ramos has promised that the government would provide
office space for the ABC secretariat.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry, on the other
hand, has committed to shoulder the operating expense and the
salaries of the supporting staff. It proposed that the ABC
secretary general should come from the Philippines and serve a

<HEADLINE> EU Blames PNA for "Pre-Balloting Irregularities" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 2 (Xinhua) -- A chief European Union
observer monitoring the Palestinian elections has urged PLO leader
Yasser Arafat to "take urgent steps to try to build public and
international confidence in the election process."
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Monday, Carl Lidbom, head of the European
Union Electoral Unit monitoring the Palestinian elections, said
that irregularities by the Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
are threatening the credibility of the Palestinian elections.
</P>
<P>
Lidbom said that he was disturbed that the Palestinian Central
Election Commission (PCEC) had been set up so late (on December
22).
</P>
<P>
The chief EU observer also criticized the reduction of the
election campaign from 22 days to 14 days, saying that shortening
the campaign "without any explanation breaches the Election Law
and adds to the difficulties of independent candidates."
</P>
<P>
"Overall, the events of the past few days have created
confusion and uncertainty, and give the impression of the
arbitrary use of power to redesign the electoral architecture,"
said Lidbom.
</P>
<P>
The EU monitors believe that "the series of improvisations and
irregularities should now cease if the forthcoming elections are
to retain any credibility," he added.
</P>
<P>
So far, there has been no immediate response from the PCEC.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian Elections are set to be held on January 20.

MANILA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Economic Zone
Authority (PEZA) said today that the total approved investments in
12 state-run industrial zones reached 52 billion pesos (2.08
billion US dollars) in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The total approved investments were more than double the 25

The local subsidiary of US microprocessor giant Intel led the
list of top investments in 1995, pouring 6.1 billion pesos (244

Expansions of the existing enterprises accounted for about 35.8
billion pesos (1.43 billion dollars), or 68.6 percent of the total
project costs.
</P>
<P>
Because of the previous year's record-breaking performance, the
PEZA has set a higher target of 75 billion pesos (3 billion US

BEIJING, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The System Software Associates
Company (SSA) from the United States of America plans to move its
Asia-Pacific headquarters from Hong Kong to Beijing next month,
announced Roger Covey, chairman and chief executive officer of the
company recently here in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Covey said that he believes Beijing is the better place to
oversee and direct the company's businesses in the Asia-Pacific
region and that the move marks "a significant step forward" in the
Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
He said that during the fiscal year ended October 31, 1995, his
company's net income more than doubled to 34.1 million US dollars,
compared with 15.4 million US dollars in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that his company "achieved record results in China
and Japan" during the past fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 Chinese enterprises, including the Shanghai No. 2
Machinery Plant, Xi'an Aircraft Company and China-Schindler
Elevator Co., Ltd., are using SSA's business planning and
control system (BPCS) softwares.
</P>
<P>
An official from the company said that he believes that China
has a huge potential market for BPCS softwares as the traditional
way of management under the planned economic system can not meet
the market development in the country, leaving rooms for modern
management and production techniques.
</P>
<P>
SSA, based in Chicago, entered the Chinese market at the end of
1989 and established offices in Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin. In
June, 1994, it established SSA (China) Co., Ltd., to promote
businesses on the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan.

<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Coal transport capacity in north
China's Shanxi province has been enhanced more than a dozen times
due to the operation of twelve large coal transport depots
recently.
</P>
<P>
The newly-completed coal transport centers in the northern part
of Shanxi were built to go with the Datong-Qinhuangdao railway
line which links the country's coal production base with the port
of Qinhuangdao, where coal is shipped by sea to the energy-thirsty
provinces in the east and south.
</P>
<P>
With a total investment of 1.15 billion yuan, the depots are
designed to have a combined annual loading capacity of 100 million
tons, according to a local source.
</P>
<P>
The source said that the depots are up to the world's advanced
levels in terms of loading and unloading facilities with major
equipments imported from the United States.
</P>
<P>
It takes only 50 minutes to load a train with 3,000 tons of
coal, greatly improving the coal transport capacity of the
province.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Russia to Cooperate in Plane Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Russia are to cooperate
in the manufacture of 60-seat passenger planes within a year's
time, the English-language daily Iran News reported today.
</P>
<P>
The daily quoted Mehdi Safari, Iran's Ambassador to Russia, as
saying that negotiations for the production of Illushin-114
passenger plane are at the final stage and production will start
within a year.
</P>
<P>
The stage is set for Iran to soon manufacture a Russian
passenger plane, the Iranian diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
The Illushin-114 can accommodate 50 to 60 passengers and its
production plant will be located in Isfahan, central Iran.
</P>
<P>
Safari, who was in Tehran for "home briefing," will return to
Moscow soon, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran's negotiations with Russia are underway for
the purchase of 12 Topolov-154s. He also expressed his hope for
the imminent signing of the deal.
</P>
<P>
However, a Russian diplomat here denied the report, saying that
Russian diplomats here have not heard any information from Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he told Xinhua that each Topolov-154s will cost
12-15 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat disclosed that Iran has to repay its 500 million
dollars of debt to Russia, which will be increased to 1.2 billion
dollars by the time of the finalization of the deals for the
projects under negotiation.
</P>
<P>
The debt is scheduled to be paid in full by 1999 and 250
million dollars will be paid to Russia annually according to the
mutually-agreed plan, he added.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Minister of Economic Affairs and Finance Morteza
Mohammad Khan will fly to Moscow to co-chair the meeting along
with Russian Vice-Premier Oleg Davidov who visited Iran last week.
</P>
<P>
"The joint commission has a number of projects to discuss,"
Safari said, pointing out that a 1,000-megawatt power station will
be built in East Azerbaijan with Russian technical assistance.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Minister of Energy Bijan Namdar Zangeneh will travel
to Moscow in April to hold talks with Russian officials for
bilateral cooperation in the field of energy.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he added, Iran and Russia are to cooperate in
exploitating and extracting oil in both the Caspian Sea and the
Persian Gulf.

<HEADLINE> Lake Victoria Anti-Pollution Plan To Be Formulated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania, Kenya and
Uganda will formulate a Plan to mitigate pollution and related
disasters in Lake Victoria shared by three countries.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued by the Regional Program's
secretariat based here on Monday, the proposed plan, part of the
recent endorsed Lake Victoria Environmental Management Program,
aims at improving the capacity of each riparian state in
mitigating the disasters in the lake.
</P>
<P>
According to the proposed plan, anti-pollution measures will
include the assessment, predication, prevention and mitigation of
pollution and other disasters in Lake Victoria.
</P>
<P>
The satement said disaster mitigation efforts would ultimately
lead to reduction of econological damage, loss of property and
lives, and economic and social disruption caused by widespread
pollution and related environmental disasters.
</P>
<P>
Studies made by environmental experts from the three countries
in the past year have shown high levels of pollution discharges
into the giant lake.
</P>
<P>
The main pollutants include agrochemicals and, mercury used in
gold mining in the lake's catchment area.
</P>
<P>
An expert report which has been presented to the Policy
Steering Committee of the Regional Program, said that
pollution problems in the lake called for emergency alert
mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
It suggests that Lake Victoria's pollution disaster management
plan should start its implementation in July this year.
</P>
<P>
The report estimated that each riparian state would need about
50,000 U.S. Dollars for the implementation of the proposed plan.

<P>
The normalization with Egypt, an active supporter of the
anti-Iraq coalition during the Gulf crisis, was symbolized by the
visit of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to Jordan last January.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Jordan improved its ties with the
Palestinians by dispelling their fears that arouse among the
Palestinians due to Jordan's special role in Jerusalem under the
Jordanian-Israeli accord.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Jordan also made efforts to push forward the
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations on expanding Palestinian autonomy
in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
To its own benefits, Jordan's peace treaty with Israel and new
attitude toward Baghdad have also brought about warmer ties with
the Western countries, with the United States in particular.
</P>
<P>
Among others, U.S. Vice President Al Gore, British Prime
Minister John Major, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Japanese Prime
Minister Tomiichi Murayama as well as Spanish Prime Minister
Felipe Gonzalez, visited Amman and reiterated their countries'
support for the kingdom in various fields.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher came to Jordan time
and again to meet with King Hussein during his more than a dozen
of shuttle visits to the region to expedite the ongoing Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton Administration also voiced its full support, without
reservation, to the kingdom to defend its security immediately
after Iraqi former Industry Minister Kamel Hassan defected to
Jordan in August, warning against a threat of Iraqi retaliation
upon Jordan.
</P>
<P>
In the past year, King Hussein, Crown Prince Hassan and Prime
Minister Sharif Zeid Ben Shaker as well as other senior Jordanian
officials traveled to London, Paris, Tokyo, Bonn and Washington,
bringing home agreements for economic aid or military assistance
as well as promises of support.
</P>
<P>
Its success of hosting the second Middle East and North Africa
economic summit in Amman, which drew the participation of 1,600
government officials and private businessmen from 62 countries
across the world, added great credit to the kingdom and was considered
the crowning accomplishment of Jordan's foreign policy.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier on Domestic, International Affairs (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "the theory of China Threat" spread by some
people overseas, the premier said this allegation is groundless.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that China made outstanding economic achievements in
the past 17 years, which has attracted worldwide
attention. "However", he said, "we must take the important factor
into consideration that China has a population of 1.2 billion."
</P>
<P>
Judged by per capita Gross National Product and per capita
output, China remains a developing country, Li noted, adding that
some per capita indexes of China are still lower than the
international average level and that it will take China about 30
years to realize modernization.
</P>
<P>
Li noted some anti-China forces in a small number of western
countries, with ulterior motives to contain China's development,
has been spreading the "theory of China Threat" by exaggerating
China's economic strength on purpose.
</P>
<P>
At present, China is not strong in terms of comprehensive
national strength, but the implementation of socialist system
enables the country to concentrate its strengthen on the
construction of some major projects.
</P>
<P>
Li said China pursues the independent foreign policy of
peace. "Chinese people are peace-loving and they cherish the
hard-earned independence, sovereignty and freedom," Li said.
</P>
<P>
China opposes any forms of hegemonism and power politics, he
said. "China will never practice hegemonism itself nor seek any
sphere of influence," he said.
</P>
<P>
Even when China gets stronger in the future, it will, as always,
maintain friendly relations with other countries, especially
good-neighbor relations with its surrounding countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
On domestic issues, Li stressed that the Communist Party of
China (CPC) Central Committee with comrade Jiang Zemin as its core
has been completely established. "Our CPC Central Committee is
united, authoritive and capable of handling international and
domestic issues properly," Li said.
</P>
<P>
"This has acknowledged by the whole Party and Chinese people as
well as foreign statesmen with no bias," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as its core
will resolutely practise the theory of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics put forward by Comrade Deng Xiaoping,
adhere to the reform and opening-up policy and follow the basic line
of the Party so as to promote the development of various causes in
China," he said. "We are fully confident about this," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
In analyzing the world situation, Li said, China is carrying
out a large-scale modernization construction, which calls for both
domestic political stability and an international environment of
peace. Neither of the two basic conditions can be dispensed with,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Taking the world as a whole, peace and development will still
be the major theme in the coming 15 years and even well into the
next century. Though regional conflicts, local wars and ethnic
contradictions occur from time to time, the world situation in
general is tending towards relaxation.
</P>
<P>
A relatively stable and peaceful international environment can
be obtained through the common efforts of the people of all
nations. This is also an important basis, on which China makes
its blueprint for modernization construction in the next five
years and the first 10 years in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of the Cold War, the world has shown a tendency
towards multipolarization; the tendency towards peaceful solution
of disputes through negotiations has developed; the momentum of
international economic ties and co-operations has been
strengthened.
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, we must see that hegemonism and power politics are
still lingering on and that peace and development still face a
series of grave challenges. We must, therefore, be prepared for
hardship and think of danger in time of peace," the premier said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the prediction by some foreign politicians and
economists that the Asia-Pacific region will be the economic
development center of the world in the 21st century, Li Peng said
that it can not be said simply that the 21st century will see Asia
and Pacific economies as the mainstay in the world.
</P>
<P>
In the world of today, Europe, the United States and Japan are
still the strongest economies, and it will not be an objective
view to deny this, he said. On the other hand, he said, Asia,
eastern Asia in particular, has been undergoing a relatively high
speed of economic growth, and this momentum of rapid development
is expected to continue into the next five years or even further
future. This region will play a increasingly greater role in the
world economy.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he said, developing countries in America and
other regions, will also see and maintain the momentum of economic
development so long as they can maintain a stable political
situation and a good outside environment.
</P>
<P>
Based upon the above analysis, it wouldn't be an all-round view
that the 21st century would be the century of Asia-Pacific region
as was said, he said.
</P>
<P>
The premier predicted that five or six regions with relatively
faster economic growth may appear in the 21st century, which is
closely linked to the development of the tendency of
multipolarization of the world.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Allow Bidding for Import, Export Quotas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is set to abolish the
equal distribution of quotas on export and import items among
businesses by organizing trial biddings, sources said.
</P>
<P>
The sources said this proposal by the Ministry of Commerce is
expected to temporarily help eliminate back-door dealings and
kickback in the foreign trade sector and make the country's
exports more competitive on foreign markets by fostering a strong
sense of competition among domestic businesses.
</P>
<P>
Export quota distribution was adopted several years ago when
the government signed with other countries trade agreements on
exports of a certain volume of commodities.
</P>
<P>
Exports like rice, coffee and garments make big money for
exporting businesses. Exporters tried to pay the lowest prices
possible to domestic producers who cannot find foreign buyers for
their products.
</P>
<P>
However, imports face the same problem. The volume of imports
is controlled by the government. With no access to information
about the real selling prices of imported commodities, consumers
have to pay much higher prices fixed by importers.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier on Domestic, International Affairs (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The proposal adopted at the
Fifth Plenum of the 14th CPC (Communist Party of China) Central
Committee as well as President Jiang Zemin's important speech at
the meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) in
Osaka can serve as the generous gifts of the Chinese government
and the Chinese people for the 21st century, said Chinese Premier
Li Peng.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with "China's Talents", a bi-monthly magazine,
in late November, Li said the Proposal for Formulating the Ninth
Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) and Long-Term Target for the Year 2010
and Jiang's speech have answered questions on what kind of China
will enter into the 21st century and how China will pose to greet
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
In the talk by the Chinese premier, which appeared in the
latest issue of the magazine published on January 1, Li said the
formulation of the trans-century and ambitious development
plan is of great significance to summing up the experience in
economic construction and social development in the Eighth
Five-Year Plan (1991--1995) as well as the 17 years since China
initiated the reform and opening-up policy and the past 46 years
since the founding of new China.
</P>
<P>
"The realization of the goals is of great significance to
China's future. It is also an enormous impetus to promoting world
peace, stability and development," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the changes and development in China and the rest of
the world in the 20th century, the Chinese premier said the first
half of the century is a history in which the Chinese people
struggled to win national liberation and the victory of people's
revolution. The second half, he said, is a history of development
for the Chinese people to reinvigorate economy and various social
causes and strive for the prosperity of the country.
</P>
<P>
Since the Third Plenum of the 11th CPC Central Committee in
1978, the Chinese people has undertaken the great practice of
reform and opening up to the outside world and advanced along the
road of building socialism with Chinese characteristics put
forward by Comrade Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
In summing up China's experience and enlightment over the past
100 years, Li said a country, after winning independence, should
concentrate on economic construction and keep emancipating and
developing productive forces with the precondition of maintaining
State stability. Only by doing so, Li said, can a country be made
stronger and people's life improved.
</P>
<P>
China has the conditions to maintain the current development
momentum and can attain the level of relatively developed
countries in the middle of the next century, the Chinese premier
said.

<P>
DHAKA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The mainstream opposition parties
in Bangladesh have decided to go ahead with their earlier planned
strikes on January 3-4 in protest against the ruling party's
failure to turn up at scheduled talks Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The secretary general of the ruling Bangladesh Nationalist
Party (BNP), Abdus Salam Talukdar, and 2 cabinet ministers did not
turn up at a scheduled meeting with the opposition at the
residence of US ambassador to Dhaka David N. Merrill on Monday
afternoon. Meanwhile, the BNP announced the list of 270 candidates
for the ensuing general elections.
</P>
<P>
At a joint meeting last night, the opposition parties including
the Awami (people's) League, the Jatiya (national) Party and the
Jamaat-e-Islami decided to go ahead with the 48-hour countrywide
strike.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also discussed the on-going backstage parleys with
the ruling party, the role of the armed forces relating to the
holding of general elections and the opposition's planned street
agitations, sources said, adding that the parties called upon the
armed forces "not to play into the hands of one party."
</P>
<P>
The BNP was not sincere in resolving the deadlock and that's
why it canceled the scheduled follow-up meeting between the
government and the opposition, Sheikh Hasina, president of the
Awami League, said at an extended meeting of Dhaka city unit of

<HEADLINE> Indian PM Asks Karnataka to Release Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister P.V.
Narasimha Rao Monday night asked Karnataka to release six thousand
million cubic (TMC) feet of Cauvery water immediately to Tamil
Nadu to save the standing crops in the state, the Times of India
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the prime minister also appointed a three-member
committee for assessment of the crop in the river's delta.
</P>
<P>
It is, however, not clear whether Karnataka will abide by Rao's
decision as Chief Minister H.D. Deve Gowda, before leaving for
Bangalore this evening, had told reporters that any decision on
the sharing of water will be implemented only after consultations
with the state cabinet and opposition parties scheduled for
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Coming as did only a few months before the next general
elections, the prime minister's decision seems to be aimed at
appeasing both Karnataka and Tamil Nadu by meeting their demands
half-way.
</P>
<P>
It fell short of Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J. Jayalalitha's
demand for release of 11 TMC ft, which was based on the December
19 interim order of the Cauvery tribunal.
</P>
<P>
Karnataka has, however, been opposed to the demand, saying that
Tamil Nadu reservoirs had adequate water for the standing crop.
Chief Minister Gowda had also demanded conducting of a survey to
ascertain Tamil Nadu's claim, which the prime minister has
accepted by appointing an experts committee.
</P>
<P>
Rao's decision came after hectic discussions with chief
ministers of the concerned states over the past three days as was
directed by the Supreme Court.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Ruling Party Fails to Meet Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Bangladesh Nationalist
Party (BNP) leaders did not turn up at a scheduled meeting with
the opposition Monday afternoon, according to reliable sources
here today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was scheduled at the residence of US ambassador to
Bangladesh David N. Merrill as a follow-up of Sunday's parley when
an appointment of a neutral prime minister or prime advisor was
discussed.
</P>
<P>
During Sunday's talks, BNP Secretary General Abdus Salam
Talukdar and two cabinet ministers led the government side.
</P>
<P>
The opposition hammered its point of appointing a neutral prime
minister or chief advisor with all executive power to head a
caretaker government and favored deferment of the February 7
election announced by the Election Commission as they felt that
voting during the Ramdan is not possible, the sources said, adding
that BNP leaders appeared to have softened their stand on the
non-party prime minister or chief advisor.
</P>
<P>
But the absence of BNP negotiators from Monday's scheduled
meeting and subsequent announcement of BNP nominations for the
ensuing polls made a possible solution to the country's prolonged
political crisis uncertain, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
The sources, however, did not rule out a meeting between the
two sides today or the day after to have a negotiated settlement
of the crisis at the eleventh hour.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thailand to Spur Economic Growth in 1996 (by Yu Zuncheng) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 2 (Xinhua) -- In the new year, the Thai
government will focus on stimulating economic growth, expected to
be around 8 percent, while bringing down inflation to 5 percent,
as against 5.8 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In its budget for the fiscal 1996, which started on October 1,
1995, the government set aside 843.2 billion baht (33.73 billion
US dollars) for investment, representing 38.7 percent of the
total, the highest on record.
</P>
<P>
Some 16 percent of the investment budget, or 135 billion baht
(5.4 billion dollars), has been allocated for rural development.
</P>
<P>
This year, the government will also move to mobilize savings
more effectively. The tax on interest from fixed deposits over
100,000 baht (4,000 US dollars) has been lowered from 15 percent
to 10 percent for 1996.
</P>
<P>
Withholding tax on savings account will be waived if the
interest is fewer than 20,000 (800 dollars) a year, compared with
10,000 baht (400 dollars) in the past.
</P>
<P>
The government is expected to tap overseas loans worth 3.7
billion dollars this year to finance megaprojects such as mass
transit systems, the third phase of the Bangkok expressway, the
Nong Ngu Hao airport, among others.
</P>
<P>
Liquidity swings on the local market are expected to be
lessened this year, with state enterprises alone being likely to
tap some 14 billion baht (560 million dollars) in financing, by
soaking up excess liquidity.
</P>
<P>
Tariffs of some 6,898 imported goods began to fall on January
1, from an average of 30.2 percent to 21.26 percent. In 1997, the
average tariff will be 17 percent. Tariffs on many imported
agricultural goods are also being reduced this year.
</P>
<P>
To improve the environment, the "polluters pay" principle will
be applied starting this year to force companies to take
responsibility for any damage they caused. Those that comply with
emission standards will be eligible for tax incentives.
</P>
<P>
The government has also set up a fund of 4 billion baht (160
million dollars) to offer soft loans to finance education.
Students will be entitled to 300,000 baht (12,000 dollars) in
loans per year.
</P>
<P>
Tax incentives are also available to investors who want to
develop schools.

<HEADLINE> Mongolia Produces Record Amount of Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, Mongolia, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia posted a
record gold output of more than 4,000 kilograms in the past year,
according to bank statistics published by the local press today.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Mongolia said in a statement that the 63
gold-digging enterprises in the country turned in gold extracts
which, once refined to 99.99-percent pure gold, would weigh 4,077
kilograms in all, worth 19.8 billion tugriks (41.6 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Bank officials attributed the record annual production to
favorable financial policies of the government which helped
attract foreign investment in the industry.
</P>
<P>
Russian, Canadian and Japanese diggers have joined their
Mongolian counterparts in extracting gold which is one of the main
natural resources of the country.
</P>
<P>
Annual gold production is projected to reach 10,000 kilograms
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The central bank has raised the purchase price of gold seven
times since 1991. Mongolian banks now pay 4,900 tugriks (10.3
dollars) for each gram of pure gold they purchase.

<HEADLINE> Poland Sets New Tariff Rates on Agricultural Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, January 1 (Xinhua) -- The Polish government decided
today to set new tariff rates for the import and export of
agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
The move is aimed at laying a solid foundation for the
development of the country's agriculture by stablizing the prices
of domestically-produced farm goods, backing the food processing
industry and improving feed supply, the local press said today.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the decision, the import of wheat and barley before
the end of March and that of corn and beans before the end of
April this year will be exempted from taxation.
</P>
<P>
The customs duties on imported dregs of fat and ground feed
in the whole year will be lifted, according to the decision.
</P>
<P>
In addition, milk and fruit juice producers in the country can
import duty free packaging papers and paperboards needed for
their products under the new tariff policy.
</P>
<P>
Spare parts of agricultural machinery are also included in the
list of imported products free of taxation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government decided to impose tariff quotas on
the export of livestocks, beer, alcoholic beverages and cigarettes
in an effort to protect the interests of domestic producers.

BANGKOK, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is expected to spend
350 billion baht (14 billion US dollars) on a package of projects
to better the quality of life of farmers, a report said here

</P>
<P>
The projects will be included in the 1997-2001 national plan

With the new strategies, the annual growth rate in the
agricultural sector is expected to rise to 3 percent from 2
percent now, it said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Adopts New Exchange Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Russia adopted new exchange rates
today for the rouble against the U.S. dollar, reports said.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of 1996, the exchange rates between the
rouble and the dollar will fluctuate between 4,550:1 and 5,150:1.
</P>
<P>
The fluctuations of the exchange rate, called the "foreign
currency corridor", started on July 5, 1995, when the rouble was
changed at between 4300 and 4900 for 1 dollar.
</P>
<P>
Most Russian economists said the mechanism of "foreign currency
corridor" has helped stabilize financial markets and protect the
interests of the country's producers and depositors.
</P>
<P>
However, some critics have said the mechanism has affected the
interests of Russian exporters.

<HEADLINE> Russia's Foreign Trade Turnover Up in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Russia's foreign trade turnover
reached about 97.5 billion U.S. dollars in 1995, a 24-percent
increase over 1994, according to a senior Russian official.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with reporters from the country's leading news
agency, First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets said exports in
1995 amounted to 63 billion dollars, while imports were worth 34.5
billion dollars, the Interfax news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Confirming Interfax's report, the Itar-Tass news agency also
quoted Soskovets as saying in the interview that the tendency of
growth in export of raw products and materials will be maintained
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Neither agency mentioned when the interview took place.
According to earlier reports, Soskovets held a meeting with
reporters of leading Russian news agencies on Saturday and he told
the reporters that the results of the economic development in 1995
pointed to the start of macroeconomic stabilization.
</P>
<P>
Itar-Tass on Monday quoted Soskovets as saying a favorable
world market and limited demand in the country had contributed to
growing exports of natural gas, electric energy and metallurgical,
chemical, timber and paper products.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, a significant strengthening of the real
exchange rate of the rouble, that occurred in the past several
months of 1995, did not have any impact on the volume of exports,
which is related to the implementation of long-term contracts,"
Soskovets pointed out.
</P>
<P>
According to him, a tendency of growth had been observed in
Russia's bilateral trade with members of the Commonwealth of
Independent States(CIS) since the beginning of 1995. But the
share of trade with the CIS member states in Russia's total
continued to decline, he added.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the debts of the CIS countries to Russian
enterprises for fuel and energy supplies now exceed 15 trillion
roubles (about 3.2 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The first deputy prime minister said machinery and equipment
will account for 44-45 percent of the total imports in 1996,
compared with 16 percent in 1995. This indicates that investments
have begun to increase.
</P>
<P>
He also said that there is a need for state regulation on
imports of equipment, which can be produced in Russia itself.
This, he stressed, will help stimulate, on the whole, production
of goods for internal consumption.

<HEADLINE> 1996 US Economic Outlook: Not Too Hot, Not Too Cold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 1, (Xinhua) -- Some U.S. economic analysts
are forecasting that 1996 will produce economic growth at a
moderate pace -- not too strong and not too weak, according to an
Associated Press report today.
</P>
<P>
The economy, after expanding by 4.1 percent in 1994, the
fastest rate in a decade, is forecast to grow at an annual rate
of about 3 percent in 1996 as measured by GDP.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts are predicting a slower growth of around
2.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
But consumer prices have been rising at an annual rate of just
2.6 percent so far this year, giving the nation its fourth
straight year with an inflation rate below 3 percent. Many
economists forecast that the rate of inflation will remain below 3
percent next year.
</P>
<P>
However, surveys show that Americans are still worried that the
waves of corporate reductions in recent years could wipe out their
jobs. And growth in real incomes, which has been lagging for the
past two decades, has shown no signs of picking up.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate, currently at 5.6 percent, has been
hovering around that level for the past 12 months. Analysts
believe it will show only a slight uptick in 1996, averaging 5.7
percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
As for economic growth, analysts believe the year will start
slow as many sectors, such as automakers and retailers, struggle
to reduce a backlog of unsold products. But growth should
gradually climb up as interest-sensitive sectors such as housing
and autos respond to lower rates.
</P>
<P>
Analysts concede that there are some threats to their generally
optimistic outlook. One is the uncertainty over whether Congress
and Clinton can end their stalemate and produce a seven-year
balanced budget agreement. Another threat is the country's huge
trade deficit, which shot up to record levels in 1995.

LAGOS, January 1 (Xinhua) -- The British government is
sponsoring some businessmen on a visit to Nigeria to bolster
trade relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The News Agency of Nigeria today quoted a report as saying
that the trip, scheduled for February, would be subsidized by the
British Department of Trade and Industry under the auspices of
the London Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming business trip comes on the heels of the
suspension of Nigeria from the Commonwealth of Nations in
November last year, and the selective sanctions slammed on
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The selective sanctions were imposed on the country by the
European Union and the United States over the November hangings
of nine Ogoni minority rights activists for murder.
</P>
<P>
Olaokun Soyinka, the co-ordinator of Nigerian pro-democracy
umbrella groups in London, said despite all apparent reactions of
the British government against Nigeria, "it is business as
usual."
</P>
<P>
Britain, Nigeria's former colonial master, remains the
country's biggest trading partner with huge investments in a
number of industries in Nigeria.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanians Urged To Eliminate Poverty Through Self-Reliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 1 (Xinhua) -- President Benjamin Mkapa
has urged all Tanzanians to cooperate with the government in
combating poverty through self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
In his New Year message last night, President Mkapa warned
that over-dependence on foreign aid would never bring development
to Tanzania and therefore the trend should be fought forthwith.
</P>
<P>
"I want to emphasize that self-reliance is the only way to our
country's development and to get rid of the donors' dictation,"
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
President Mkapa said cooperation between the people and the
government is vital to the achievement of development in the
country, cautioning that development could not be brought about
by the government alone.
</P>
<P>
He said in order to record success in the war against poverty,
the nation should increase its self-reliance ability through the
tight control of government expenditure on the one hand and
increase government incomes on the other.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa promised that his government would ensure there is good
governance which is an important factor in bringing about the
country's development.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Navy Has Equipment Repaired Locally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 1 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian navy is poised to
boost its relationship with relevant technical industries in the
country to ensure that the nation's warships and other equipment
in its arsenal are maintained locally.
</P>
<P>
Naval sources said here today the navy headquarters have
critically looked at the competence of some local industries and
are already involving them in the task of maintaining some naval
equipment including warships.
</P>
<P>
The News Agency of Nigeria quoted the sources as saying the
efforts are yielding positive results as some local industries
whose technical expertise are being utilized are improving on the
jobs with each task.

needs to sustain the navy."

recently reiterated the determination of the navy to intensify
the current efforts to localize the maintenance of its weapon

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Sets Record In Mineral Exports In 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean mineral exports in
1995 are estimated to have earned the country a record 667
million US dollars, as against 478 million in l994.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe News Agency today quoted Roy Pitchford, President
of the Chamber of Mines of Zimbabwe, as saying minerals
production in 1995 went up on the back of firm prices on the
international market, benefiting producers of nickel, ferrochrome
and copper.
</P>
<P>
''Gold production looks good and by (the) end of November,
1995, we had 22,268 kg worth 262 million US dollars,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
God production in l995 would reach 24 tonnes, the highest
since 1916, when about 29 tonnes were produced, he said.
</P>
<P>
Gold output in Zimbabwe, Africa's third largest producer after
South Africa and Ghana, has been increasing annually during the past
five years, forcing many producers to intensify exploration
activities.
</P>
<P>
Roy Pitchford said despite increased production, rising input
costs were seriously affecting the viability of the mining industry,
which contributes more than 45 percent of the country's foreign
exchange earnings.
</P>
<P>
''At the same time, interest rates for local borrowing remained
prohibitively high, a situation which shows no sign of improving in
the foreseeable future,'' he said. enditem

<HEADLINE> Egypt's Newly-Named PM to Hold Consultations for Forming New Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The cabinet of former Prime Minister Atef Sedki resigned
earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Ganzouri, 63, had been deputy prime minister and planning
minister in Sedki's cabinet, whose decision to resign was taken at
a half-hour emergency session this evening.
</P>
<P>
Ganzouri graduated from the Faculty of Agriculture of Cairo
University and got a PHD degree in economics at the Michigan
University of the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East News Agency (MENA) quoted Information Minister
Safwat el-Sherif as saying that Sedki and his cabinet made the
decision to give the president a chance to choose "the appropriate
person for this crucial phase of national action."
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, after assigning Ganzouri to form the new cabinet,
praised what Sedki's cabinet had done over the past nine years.
</P>
<P>
He told the press that Sedki initiated the economic reform
program during the country's toughest period, according to MENA.
</P>
<P>
"I greet this man (Sedki) and had not the efforts been too much
for him, I would have kept him for another period, " MENA quoted
the president as saying.
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to give a push to national action in the different
domains and I introduce this change for further activation of the
development process," Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
He said that he has always been looking for the best for Egypt,
especially under the present circumstances in the region and all
over the world.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said that now he can not expect or say who will stay in
the new cabinet and who will be replaced, adding that the new
prime minister will decide.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that there will be also some replacements on
the governorate level.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said that there will be no change in Egypt's policy
after the cabinet reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
In a government resignation letter submitted earlier by Sedki
to Mubarak, Sedki said the cabinet ministers have exerted all
possible efforts for realizing the hoped-for national targets,
MENA said.
</P>
<P>
Sedki, 65, also said in the letter that the government managed
to realize a marked progress in implementing the first phase of
the economic reform program which was primarily aimed at
regulating the Egyptian monetary and financial policies.
</P>
<P>
The last major cabinet reshuffle occurred in October 1993, when
14 ministers were replaced.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The number of homeless people
who died in San Francisco rose to 142 last year, the largest
number since records began being kept a decade ago, according to
reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
It marked the eight consecutive year that Coroner's Office and
Department of Public Health found that more than 100 homeless had
died on city streets, in vacant buildings, shelters or transient
hotels.
</P>
<P>
The study found that in 1994 eight homeless people died during
the week between Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve alone. September
1995 proved to be the deadliest month with 16 deaths reported.
</P>
<P>
It said drugs and alcohol abuse continued to be the leading
factor to death among the homeless. The latest study found that 40
percent of the deaths were related to drug abuse with many also
suffering from alcohol abuse.
</P>
<P>
Among the other leading causes of death were illness and
disease (25 percent), murder (10 percent) and suicide (10
percent).
</P>
<P>
The majority of those who died were men numbered in 124 ranging
in age from 15 to 75.
</P>
<P>
The annual survey was first taken in 1985 by the Tenderloin
Times, a local neighborhood newspaper. When the paper ceased
publication in 1993, the Department of Public Health took over the
study.
