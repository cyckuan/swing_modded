DETROIT NIPS CAPITALS,2-1, IN FIRST GAME OF STANLEY CUP SERIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DTROIT _ In the 60 seasons that the National Hockey League has
used a four-of-seven-game format for the Stanley Cup finals, the
team that has won Game 1 has gone on to win the title almost 80
percent of the time. In the last three seasons, that winning team
has prevailed in a four-game sweep.
</P>
<P>
   These long-term and short-term trends suggest a positive and
rapid conclusion of the season for the Detroit Red Wings. In
opening their defense of their championship on Tuesday night, they
jumped ahead by 2-0 in the first period and went on to a 2-1
victory over the Washington Capitals. Game 2 will be here on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The first period on Tuesday night was played at a tentative
pace, and the Capitals may have been awestruck after having won the
Eastern Conference title by eliminating the Bruins, Senators and
Sabres.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Red Wings got over their own little jitters, they
scored two goals in a span of 2 minutes 14 seconds to hold a 2-0
lead at the first intermission.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the first goal was Joe Kocur, who had not worn a uniform
in four of the six games of the previous round, the Western
Conference final against the Dallas Stars. Kocur charged to the
crease from the right side and put the puck past Washington goalie
Olaf Kolzig at 14:04 after a pass from Doug Brown. Tomas Holmstrom
got the other assist. It was the fourth goal of the playoffs for
Kocur, who also scored in last spring's finals against the Flyers.
</P>
<P>
   Scoring the second goal was Niklas Lidstrom, who took a
fluttering shot from the blue line. Kolzig seemed screened on the
play, probably by Holmstrom, who occupied the low slot after
winning a battle for possession behind the Capitals' net. It was
Lidstrom's sixth playoff goal.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Juneau, the Washington forward, said between periods that
his team started ``panicking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We started giving the puck away,'' Juneau said in a televised
interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the second period, one of the highlights was a body
check by Detroit's Kris Draper against Juneau. Draper found him
along the boards while Juneau was trying to play the puck and
leveled him with a hit that knocked the helmet from Juneau's head.
Juneau is one of Washington's most dangerous shooters and,
therefore, a target for checkers such as Draper.
</P>
<P>
   The next bit of mayhem involved Dale Hunter, the ancient
Washington center and captain, against Steve Yzerman, the veteran
center and captain of the Wings. After Yzerman lost a face-off,
Hunter drove him to the ice and pushed against Yzerman's helmet for
emphasis, knocking it off. Yzerman jumped to his skates and slashed
Hunter's legs, earning a two-minute penalty from referee Bill
McCreary.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitals cut the lead to 2-1 at 15:57 when Richard Zednik, a
rookie with a scoring touch, put a shot past goalie Chris Osgood,
Detroit's weakest link. Osgood got a piece of the puck before it
fell behind him, over the line. Setting it up were Andrei
Nikolishin and Peter Bondra, the other two-thirds of Washington's
European line.
</P>
<P>
   The next scrum came late in the period, also involving the two
captains. As the Wings threatened around the net of Kolzig, Hunter
landed again atop Yzerman and worked him over. McCreary called no
penalty for this, although he did send Washington's Chris Simon off
for roughing in the same scrum.

WOMAN CHARGED WITH MURDER IN QUEENS FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Police detectives accused a 43-year-old woman of
second-degree murder and arson Tuesday, saying she set a fire that
killed one person and injured nine others on Monday at an
overcrowded home in Queens. City officials also cited the home's
owner for illegally subdividing the two-family residence into six
apartments.
</P>
<P>
   The woman charged with murder, Marsha Manning, 43, was accused
of pouring a flammable liquid on the stairways on three floors and
then lighting the fire because of a dispute with her landlord, said
Frank Gribbon, a Fire Department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   A city official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said
investigators began to suspect the woman after hearing reports that
she had recently threatened to burn down the house, at 163-14 109th
Ave. in South Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the man who died, two people were seriously
injured in the blaze. Another resident, a woman eight months'
pregnant, survived the fire by jumping two stories to the sidewalk,
and was treated for minor injuries, city officials said. The
identity of the man who died was not released Tuesday night because
his next of kin had not been notified.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said they were still trying to determine whether
the illegal subdivision of the house played any role in the death
of the man, who was found on the third floor.
</P>
<P>
   Buildings Department officials said inspectors from their agency
cited the home's owner, JoAnne Smith, of the same address, with two
building code violations: building walls without a permit and
subdividing the residence without permission from the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you limit access, you create the potential for serious
danger,'' said Ted Birkhahn, a Buildings Department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Gribbon, the Fire Department spokesman, said fire investigators
determined that 15 people from 10 families were living in the
house.
</P>
<P>
   The house had been illegally subdivided to create three bedrooms
and a living room in the attic, and five bedrooms, a kitchen and a
bathroom in the cellar, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Residents near the burned-out home and others said that they had
long complained to city officials about the behavior of the people
who lived in the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of drinking going on over there, a lot of
arguments and fights, with young kids over there smoking weed,''
said Maverick Brown as he held his 20-month-old daughter,
Dimonique, while sitting on the front steps of his brother-in-law's
two-story home. ``I don't like to bring my daughter out here much
because of that.''
</P>
<P>
   One neighbor, Fred Simmons, complained about landlords acquiring
homes and illegally converting them into mini-apartment buildings
in which they do not crack down on tenants involved in criminal
activity.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons, an official with a community organization, has lived
with his family on the block for almost five years. He said that
during that time, the block association complained repeatedly about
the house, where the fire was on Monday, and that there were other
homes that appeared to be overcrowded.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is another house on our block that we are concerned
about,'' Simmons said. ``I hope that now, the city will finally do
something.''

PORTER LEADS 19 INTO TOURNEY FIELD

<TEXT>
<P>
   Lee Porter, who lost his card on the PGA Tour twice, shot rounds
of 68 and 69 Tuesday for a 36-hole total of 137, seven under par,
to lead the U.S. Open Sectional Qualifying at Canoe Brook Country
Club in Summit, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The 32-year-old Porter led 19 qualifiers into the Open, which
will be played next week at the Olympic Club in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Fuzzy Zoeller, winner of the 1984 Open at Winged Foot, trailed
Porter by two strokes after shooting 73-66-139. A field of 106,
including 15 amateurs, competed.
</P>
<P>
   Porter missed only one green. He had a three-putt for a bogey on
the eighth hole, then sank a 30-foot birdie putt on the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Porter played on the Nike Tour in 1995 and 1996 after losing his
PGA Tour card for the first time in 1993. He finished eighth on the
Nike money list in 1996 to regain his PGA card, then lost it again
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Sluman, who won the PGA Championship in 1988, qualified at
142 along with Chip Beck. D.A. Weibring, another tour member,
advanced with a 75-69-144, as did Mike Burke Jr., the reigning Met
Golf Association Open champion.
</P>
<P>
   At 145 was Bruce Zabriski, a former National Club Pro champion
and two-time Met Open winner. Duffy Waldorf had rounds of 74-73-147
and failed to qualify.

MAINE HOLDS ITS PRIMARY AMONG MODEST SPENDERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Maine _ Maine's primary on Tuesday could be considered
a breath of cool, fresh political air after the overheated spending
of California's election last week.
</P>
<P>
   The results brought no big surprises. With more than
three-quarters of the precincts reporting, Democrats appeared to
have selected as their candidate for governor Tom Connolly, a
prominent Portland defense lawyer who emphasized social justice in
his campaign. He heavily defeated Joseph Ricci, a racetrack owner
with a tendency to become unprintably outspoken.
</P>
<P>
   Among Republicans running for governor, Jim Longley Jr., a
conservative former congressman and son of Maine's former governor,
appeared to have defeated two opponents with a campaign that
focused on tax cuts and criticism of the state's economic
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Angus King, an independent, is expected to be easily
re-elected in November.
</P>
<P>
   But for politics-watchers still goggle-eyed at the immense sums
spent on last week's primary in California _ more than $100 million
in all _ the most striking aspect of Maine's primary was its
financial modesty.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest spender in the governor's race, Connolly, had raised
about enough to cover a California campaign's dry-cleaning bills:
$21,477, according to state records. Ricci raised $16,385.
</P>
<P>
   King and the state's two House members, John Baldacci and Tom
Allen, both Democrats who faced no challenges in their primaries,
raised about $200,000. And both contenders in the Republican
primary for the 1st District seat in Congress fell well short of
$100,000.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, Maine did not appear to have reached even the $1
million mark in all its races combined.
</P>
<P>
   That would seem like cause for rejoicing in a state that is
considered one of the leaders in campaign finance reform, and is
expected to put into effect by 2000 a groundbreaking system that
would provide public money to candidates who voluntarily accept
limits on fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   But the coolness of the campaign was a little too cool for some
voters. A low turnout _ reported to be below 14 percent _ bolstered
the general impression of a campaign so lackluster and a public so
apathetic that it was called ``the stealth campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an odd election in that there's nothing going on,'' said
Bill Coogan, a political science professor at the University of
Southern Maine. ``The two parties have conceded the governorship;
there's no Senate race; and though there are two congressional
campaigns in the fall, the results are a foregone conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Maine, it seems, has a particularly potent case of the
complacency, even somnolence, that often comes with economic
prosperity, political observers said.
</P>
<P>
   In Portland on Tuesday, when several Maine voters were asked as
they left their polling booths in City Hall what issues they wished
had been highlighted, none could come up with any.
</P>
<P>
   King is so popular that neither party had reason to believe its
candidate could beat him. So the top of the ticket in both
primaries appeared to many to be all but moot, and few were willing
to give money to candidates who appeared doomed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's be honest,'' said Garison Murrell, who had just loyally
cast his ballot in the Republican primary. ``The gubernatorial
nominees don't even have a shot unless Angus King decides to parade
naked down Congress Street.''
</P>
<P>
   In other races around the country, State Rep. Blanche Lincoln of
Arkansas defeated Attorney General Winston Bryant in a runoff to
become the Democratic nominee for the Senate. She will face the
Republican candidate, State Sen. Fay Boozman.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, Rep. Bob Inglis easily defeated Stephen
Brown, a former Republican county chairman, for the Republican
nomination to face Senator Ernest Hollings, a Democrat. &QL;

JOSEPHINE HUTCHINSON, 94, MOVIE ACTRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Josephine Hutchinson, a stage and film actress who
gained prominence in the 1930s and early '40s, died on June 4 at
the Florence Nightingale Nursing Home in Manhattan. She was 94.
</P>
<P>
   After studying as a child at the Cornish School in her hometown
of Seattle, Ms. Hutchinson left for several years of stock work in
New York and Washington before joining Eva Le Gallienne's Civic
Repertory Theater while in her early 20s.
</P>
<P>
   As a leading player she won critical acclaim, particularly as
Alice in the Civic's 1932 production of ``Alice in Wonderland.''
Petite, with golden-red hair framing her heart-shaped face, Ms.
Hutchinson said her interpretation was inspired by her mother's
``cleanliness-is-next-to-godliness technique of dressing little
girls.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1934 she left New York for Hollywood to become a contract
player at Warner Brothers, making her screen debut in Mervyn
LeRoy's ``Happiness Ahead'' in 1934. Melodramas and period films
followed, including ``The Story of Louis Pasteur'' (1936), starring
Paul Muni.
</P>
<P>
   After withdrawing from acting in 1941, Ms. Hutchinson returned
in 1946 in Joseph Mankiewicz's ``Somewhere in the Night.'' Small
roles followed in films including ``Love Is Better Than Ever''
(1952), starring Elizabeth Taylor; ``North by Northwest'' (1959),
starring Cary Grant, and ``Baby, the Rain Must Fall'' (1965), with
Steve McQueen. She appeared in episodes of the television series
``The Twilight Zone,'' ``Perry Mason'' and ``Gunsmoke'' in the late
1950s and early '60s.
</P>
<P>
   No immediate family members survive.

YANKEES CRUSH EXPOS, 11-1 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ When the New York Yankees signed Orlando Hernandez in
March, they knew he was brave enough to board a leaky boat. They
knew he had the determination to defect from Cuba. They knew he
possessed a strange delivery that often changed from one pitch to
the next.
</P>
<P>
   But it is evident that even the Yankees, who saw more in
Hernandez's ability than any other team did, had no idea how good a
pitcher he could be. The pleasant shock covered the face of Joe
Torre tonight after Hernandez completed a masterful four-hit, 11-1
victory against the Montreal Expos.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez struck out nine and walked one; among the last 24
batters he faced, he went to one three-ball count. He maintained a
shutout until Montreal put together a double and single with one
out in the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over Hernandez's future is over, for now and the
foreseeable future. El Duque, as Hernandez is known, is staying.
The Yankees could not possibly return him to the minor leagues,
considering his performance in winning his first two starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to see him again,'' said Torre, the Yankee
manager, who has six good starting pitchers and only five spots in
his rotation. ``We're going to have to work it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramiro Mendoza will pitch on Friday night against Cleveland.
David Wells will play catch on Wednesday, and if his sore left
shoulder feels better, he will pitch on Saturday, then David Cone
on Sunday, and El Duque next Monday in Baltimore. After that, Torre
may finally have to move Mendoza into the bullpen, the most logical
solution. Returning Hernandez to Class AAA Columbus is not an
option. He knows how to pitch, like Julia Child knows how to cook.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Girardi, Hernandez's catcher on Tuesday night, compared him
to Cone, who compared him to Luis Tiant, a Cuban right-hander who
won 229 games in the major leagues. Hernandez reminded Torre of
Juan Marichal, with the different arm angles, different release
points, different speeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was excellent,'' said Girardi, who, like Torre, looked
stunned by Hernandez's dominance.
</P>
<P>
   After Hernandez worked out for scouts before spring training,
the consensus was that his talent was average at best. A No. 4 or
No. 5 starter. Some reported that his fastball was below average,
that his delivery might be problematic; when working with a windup,
Hernandez draws up his front left leg so high that his knee can
touch his cheekbone. Too complicated, with too many moving parts to
maintain, scouts thought.
</P>
<P>
   They thought he threw too much junk, too much soft stuff.
Interest in El Duque was limited. Executives from other teams
involved in the bidding say the Yankees' ultimate cost for
Hernandez of $6.6 million was more than twice any other offer. But
in those abbreviated workouts, scouts could not have possibly seen
what the Yankees are seeing now.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez knows how to take a little off his changeup, add a
little to his fastball. He throws curveballs when hitters are
looking for fastballs, he throws fastballs when hitters are looking
for changeups. He changes the angle of his delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal's Rondell White had 20 hits in 45 at-bats going into
Tuesday night's game, and he admitted that he had no chance against
Hernandez and his different arm angles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing is, he throws all of his off-speed pitches for
strikes,'' White said. ``Everything he threw, a strike.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Hernandez's 124 pitches, he threw 83 strikes. ``I saw the
same pitches from overhand, sidearm, I-don't-know-where-from,''
said Jose Vidro, the Expos' second baseman.
</P>
<P>
   From the third inning through the fifth, Hernandez faced 11
batters and threw first-pitch strikes to 10, but it wasn't as if he
merely exploited his early lead and pumped fastballs over the
plate. He started Vidro with a curve _ strike one. He started
Vladimir Guerrero with a fastball _ strike one. Brad Fullmer swung
and missed at a first-pitch changeup. And, as Cone noted, Hernandez
has a knack for finishing off hitters once he is ahead in the
count.
</P>
<P>
   Catching Hernandez for the first time was a challenge, Girardi
said. His pitches moved so much, particularly his fastball. Girardi
set up his target on the absolute edges of the strike zone and,
through Spanish-speaking teammate Jorge Posada, asked Hernandez in
the middle innings if that was O.K. Oh, yes, El Duque replied, and
kept throwing to those edges. Nothing in the middle of the plate,
Girardi said. Nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez said afterward that he just wanted to help the team.
With three walks and 16 strikeouts in his first 161/3 innings, he
fits right in. The Yankees are 45-13. They have won 44 of their
last 53 games, only the second team in American League history to
go on such a streak of success. The 1941 Yankees also won 44 of 53.
</P>
<P>
   They have won eight straight games. They are running away. And
Joe Torre suddenly has discovered a phenomenon on his staff.

NCAA FORMULA TO DETERMINE TEAMS FOR CHAMPIONSHIP BOWL GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Get out your calculators. The bowl championship series has
settled on a four-part formula for determining the teams that will
play for the football national championship.
</P>
<P>
   The formula, announced yesterday by Southeastern Conference
commissioner Roy Kramer, will be based on polls (news media and
coaches), computer rankings (three versions), strength of schedule
and win-loss records.
</P>
<P>
   The rating system is designed to determine only the top two
teams for the championship game and also to determine which, if
any, teams from conferences or the independent ranks will earn one
of eight berths in the four bowl championship series bowls.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a poll,'' said Kramer, coordinator of the series,
formerly the bowl alliance. ``We are doing this to go beyond the
subjective polls by the media and the coaches. We're moving into
computerized evaluations in all phases of life, and we felt it was
important to incorporate that aspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is a very definitive way to determine the two
teams in the championship game. We ran it back over the last 10 or
12 seasons and we think it's very factual.''
</P>
<P>
   By applying the statistical formula to last season, Michigan and
Nebraska would have been ranked first and second. However, those
teams didn't play because the Rose Bowl was not part of the bowl
alliance. Michigan (The Associated Press) and Nebraska (ESPN/USA
Today) each finished ranked No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``No system is perfect,'' Michigan coach Lloyd Carr said. ``But
I think we're all in the same boat. I know there's been tremendous
thought and planning that has gone into it. I'm optimistic it will
work well.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the series will add the Big Ten and Pacific-10
conferences and the Rose Bowl to its lineup. The series
championship game will be played Jan. 4 in the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The series system will incorporate the two polls, computer
rankings published in USA Today (Jeff Sagarin), The New York Times
and the Seattle Times, a strength of schedule based on a team's
opponents and its opponents' opponents plus win-loss record.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will encourage people to play stronger schedules,'' Big Ten
Conference commissioner Jim Delany said. ``For a first attempt at
coming up with something like this, I think it's a pretty good
formula.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the strength of schedule factor, the first series
rankings, which will list 10 to 12 teams, probably won't debut
until the second or third week of November. The news media and
coaches polls will continue to appear weekly.
</P>
<P>
   The final rankings, which will determine the championship game,
will be released the day after conference championship games.
</P>

   To qualify for a spot in the bowl alliance, teams outside the
series must finish ranked No. 6 or higher. That includes teams from
the Western Athletic, Conference USA, Big West and Mid-American
plus independents such as Notre Dame.

IN AMERICA, WORLD CUP MEANS NO HANDS, AND FEW FANS

<TEXT>
<P>
   My, has it been four years already?
</P>
<P>
   Four years since that spell-binding 0-0 tie in the final? Four
years since the biggest news for the home side was that somebody
kicked in a goal for the wrong team?
</P>
<P>
   Four years since we thrilled to the exploits of ... uh ... uh
... El Whatsisname?
</P>
<P>
   Yes. Just when you've calmed down after those NHL playoffs, the
world has reconvened in ``la belle France.'' Five weeks of soccer _
``le foot,'' to the French _ good wine and, perchance, an
occasional goal.
</P>
<P>
   World Cup '98 promises to be bigger and better than World Cup
'94 which, of course, was held on our shores and attracted 3.5
million live ticket buyers, most of whom couldn't even tell you El
Whatsisname's number.
</P>
<P>
   But that was the idea, wasn't it? By force-feeding us
world-class soccer, the game would finally gain its toehold on
American sports pages and in American family budgets. We would
finally be able to gather at the office water cooler and discuss
the nuances of the off-side trap. We'd call DirecTV and order the
whole Belgian A League package.
</P>
<P>
   But, no. It hasn't worked that way.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the U.S. World Cup team brandished the irresistible
charms of being (A) the home team and (B) a shameless underdog.
Team USA was studded with ringers (German-born Tom Dooley, among
them) and the ultimate mercenary head coach, Bora Milutinovic.
</P>
<P>
   That part worked. Though the only match the Americans won came
on tragically fated Andres Escobar's wrong goal (he was murdered in
his homeland a week later), the Yanks advanced to the next round.
It was one small leap for soccer-kind, and all that.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, however, it's the Americans who may as well
all be named Whatsisname. Soccer has grown, but there's a feeling
that it has found its audience.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer moms are too tired to take the minivan-full to the Major
League Soccer game. There are still too many dads out there who
couldn't tell you if a soccer ball is blown up or stuffed.
</P>
<P>
   Expected to keep the momentum ball rolling, there's a feeling
that the MLS waited too long after USA '94 to launch. The league is
still too new. Too under-publicized. Too . . . American?
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, as the U.S. team prepares for its Monday opener against
powerhouse Germany, new coach Steve Sampson's main problem is
finding offense. Go figure.
</P>
<P>
   In a country that has spawned Michael Jordan, Deion Sanders,
Pistol Pete Maravich and Joe Montana, we can't find someone out
there with the athletic creativity to score even one goal on
Macedonia?
</P>
<P>
   Same problem as 1994, if memory serves correctly. The Americans
tied Switzerland, 1-1, and then came the 2-1 upset of Colombia.
Team USA's next two contests were 1-0 losses.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in World Cup soccer, a 2-1 game is tantamount to a
Home Run Derby. Scoring a goal seems as elementary as rehanging
Stonehenge. The Brazil-Italy final four years ago ended in a 0-0
tie, decided by a first-ever shootout. There was dancing in the
streets. Honest.
</P>
<P>
   That those five weeks of soccer matches became the most-watched
and best-attended World Cup finals in history is a tribute to U.S.
organizers and, yes, to Team USA, which kindled the temporary
flame. The world never thought it would work.
</P>
<P>
   At the opening ceremonies, singer Diana Ross was supposed to
kick a ball into the goal from six feet away. She missed. Oprah
Winfrey was walking off the stage and stumbled, face first. And the
mechanism that was supposed to lift performer Jon Secada onto the
stage in mid-song broke and left Secada standing there, still
singing, only visible from the waist up.
</P>
<P>
   Draw your own symbolism from there.
</P>
<P>
   To most Americans, soccer will never quite make it onto the big
stage. Over the next five weeks, we will read the datelines _
places like Saint-Jean D'Ardieres, Saint-Denis and Montpellier _ we
will hear the players' names, and it'll all get lost in the
translation.
</P>
<P>
   Again, people are saying that a strong U.S. showing will do
wonders for the game in this country. Maybe. The June 21 meeting
with a weak Iran team figures to be the patriotic feel-good hit of
the summer.
</P>
<P>
   But the world's most popular sport may have already found its
niche back here. If you hear someone talking about it at the water
cooler, let me know.

`MARATHON '98: FIVE PLAYLETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes at end of review.) (mk) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``I'm a New Yorker; fear's my life,'' sings the
battle-scarred support-group attendee in ``Rent.'' Free-floating
anxiety may well be the birthright of every son and daughter of the
five boroughs, but everyone knows that in this perilous age, it's
parents who have first dibs on fretting.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Ayvazian knows. Oh, does she ever. In ``Plan Day,'' her
little gem of a monologue, she sets off on a short jaunt into the
mind of a maternal worrywart, the kind for whom life is less a
cabaret than an extended opportunity for the sampling of
antibacterial soaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sun screen, bug spray,'' she says, enumerating the
preventatives as she embarks on a trip to the beach with her unseen
son. ``Keep your shoes on. Got the cell phone and the megaphone.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ayvazian, author of ``Nine Armenians,'' escorts us through
the decades, riffing amusingly on the mental notes we make,
obsessively, protectively, superstitiously, to ward off evil, to
keep loved ones safe, to keep ourselves busy.
</P>
<P>
   The piece, which Ms. Ayvazian performs to perfection _ this is
the sort of woman who is the backbone of every PTA _ arrives in the
gift basket of playlets that Ensemble Studio Theater bestows on
audiences in the final segment of its annual one-act marathon.
Unlike the undistinguished series that preceded it, the five pieces
in Series C _ which include a solid new one-act play by David Mamet
and a teasingly funny playlet by Ari Roth, staged expertly by Mark
Nelson _ form a strong and varied evening, much of it full of
promise.
</P>
<P>
   If Ms. Ayvazian's ``Plan Day'' is a purging of sorts _ the full
complement of middle-age obsessions is cataloged in the planning of
one day, from ``learn something new'' to ``get the estrogen'' _
Mamet's represents a reassessing. The mood of ``The Jade
Mountain,'' like the three playlets that made up his ``Old
Neighborhood,'' is reflective and slightly melancholy.
</P>
<P>
   In the play, tautly directed by Curt Dempster, two men, A (James
Murtagh) and B (Chris Ceraso) discuss A's guilt-laden memories of
military service. An air of misgiving suffuses the room, which may
or may not belong to a psychotherapist. A is a veteran, probably of
Vietnam, who remains in a sense a prisoner of war, still troubled
by the violence. It's not a traumatic disorder exactly; the
feelings are no longer so profound. Rather, it's a low-grade sense
of regret that he seems unable to shed, the kind that festers and
manifests itself in later life as malaise.
</P>
<P>
   Murtagh is especially effective as this contemporary everyman,
seeking specific responses to questions that can be answered only
in generalities. And Mamet, preoccupied these days with decoding
the past, demonstrates in ``The Jade Mountain'' a compassion for
the attempt to interpret what's come and gone.
</P>
<P>
   Roth's ``Prelude to a Crisis,'' on the other hand, is just as
resolutely anchored in the here and now. The setup is straight out
of the comedy writer's handbook: A college playwriting instructor,
played by the goofily prepossessing Greg Germann, awaits the
arrival of a saucy student (the excellent Melinda Page Hamilton) in
his hotel room to, ahem, go over her work.
</P>
<P>
   Will it be lust or bust in the afternoon? It's Roth's sharp ear
for the music of the mating call that makes ``Prelude'' so much
fun. ``I didn't see your name in the course guide'' is how Ms.
Hamilton reveals two, three or maybe even four notions at once: why
she initiated this assignation, how conniving she is and what
ultimately is going to happen to this schnook of a professor.
</P>
<P>
   Germann, who plays the truly kooky Richard Fish on ``Ally
McBeal,'' makes an attractive romantic antihero and a terrific foil
for the self-possessed Ms. Hamilton. Nelson, the director,
demonstrates here, as he did with ``June Moon,'' a natural gift for
quick-witted comedy.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining pieces, ``The Earthquake,'' by Joyce Carol Oates
and Elinor Renfield, and ``Mary MacGregor,'' by Keith Alan
Benjamin, are less successful playlets that nonetheless receive
top-notch productions. ``The Earthquake,'' based on an Oates story,
is too psychologically sophisticated for the format: It's the tale
of a lonely boy, Roy (Shelton Dane), who, pining for an absent
father, convinces himself, against reason, that his mother has
disappeared, too.
</P>
<P>
   As staged by Ms. Renfield, the play has an appealing directness,
particularly in the moments dramatizing Roy's sullen withdrawal.
But scenes of some emotional complexity spin by so rapidly you feel
as if you're watching a movie trailer.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin's ``Mary MacGregor'' is also fetchingly acted; Anne
O'Sullivan is utterly convincing as a young widow packing up her
things as the ghost of her dead husband (Andrew Weems) lounges on
the couch. Benjamin's treatment is sweet, but the subject,
unfortunately, seems about as fresh as the reruns featured on
``Nick at Nite.''

DEVIL RAYS STING METS, 5-4 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hideo Nomo made his pitching debut for the New York
Mets on Tuesday night and created an instant buzz at Shea Stadium.
But neither Nomo nor his teammates could deliver on the
anticipation, with Nomo squandering an early three-run lead and the
Mets leaving runners all over the bases as the Tampa Bay Devil Rays
squeaked out a 5-4 victory in 11 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The winning run, fittingly enough, was set up by an error by
Luis Lopez on a double-play grounder. An inning earlier, Mike
Piazza grounded out with the bases loaded and two out and the
remainder of the crowd of 30,336 pleading for a game-winning base
hit.
</P>
<P>
   It was that kind of night for the Mets, and it was not that much
better for Nomo. The right-hander with the corkscrew windup lasted
only five innings. He was staked to a 4-1 lead after three innings,
departed after the fifth with the score tied at 4-4 and, over all,
did not look much different than he had as a Dodger in April and
May, when he struggled to a 2-7 mark with a 5.05 earned run
average.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo did finish with a flourish, though, striking out the tough
Fred McGriff with runners on first and second in the fifth with his
79th pitch of the game. That, Mets Manager Bobby Valentine decided,
was enough for someone who was pitching for the first time in 10
days.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo's final pitching line read like this: five innings, five
hits, four runs (all earned), three walks and five strikeouts.
There were also a wild pitch and a balk. Not atrocious. But not
very good, either. It appears it might take a while for Nomo to
rediscover his old formula, if he can.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Nomo provided a jolt at the box office for the
Mets. On a normal Tuesday night in June, the Mets in recent years
would have been happy to get close to 20,000 fans in the park. They
had a lot more than that on Tuesday night, helped by the 12,336
tickets they sold in the last two days in anticipation of Nomo's
debut. And it was easy to see that the patrons were desperately
looking for something to cheer for.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd reacted noisily before Nomo's first pitch, acting as
if he were about to close out a complete-game victory. But the
noise abated when the Tampa Bay leadoff hitter, Randy Winn, smacked
a 2-1 pitch inside the first-base line for a triple.
</P>
<P>
   Winn would score one out later on a Wade Boggs groundout. And
just like that, Nomo trailed, 1-0. But the Mets rallied to tie the
game for him at 1-1 in the bottom of the second inning without a
hit _ the tying run scoring on Rey Ordonez's one-out chopper over
the mound, after McGriff had thrown a potential double-play ball
into left field for an error.
</P>
<P>
   One inning later, Nomo had a big lead to work with after the
Mets erupted for three more runs off Julio Santana on a one-out
walk to Bernard Gilkey, Piazza's single to left, John Olerud's
two-run bloop double to left and a two-out run-scoring double that
Carlos Baerga spanked off the first-base bag.
</P>
<P>
   The offensive support was something of a rarity this season for
the 29-year-old Nomo, who, in reality, had only three truly bad
starts with the Dodgers before Tuesday night. So why was Nomo 2-7?
Well, in his 12 starts with Los Angeles this season, the Dodgers
had averaged just 2.25 runs in back of him, the lowest run support
for any starting pitcher in the National League. Now the Mets had
just given him four runs in three innings.
</P>
<P>
   The old Nomo, who took the major leagues by storm in 1995 when
he was named the National League's rookie of the year, might have
coasted home from there. But after undergoing off-season
arthroscopic surgery on his pitching elbow to clean out some
calcium deposits, Nomo has struggled this season with his control.
</P>
<P>
   And the walks, the wild pitch and the balk definitely hurt him
on Tuesday night. Boggs singled up the middle to open the fourth
inning, then took second on the wild pitch. McGriff followed by
lining a run-scoring double into the right-field corner. That cut
the Mets' lead to 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   Two pitches later, Dave Martinez slapped a run-scoring single up
the middle and, all of a sudden, it was a one-run game. The damage
could have been worse. But, with one out and Martinez still on
first, the Tampa Bay right fielder tried to steal second on a 1-0
pitch. Piazza's one-hop throw was to the third-base side of second
base. But Ordonez made a wonderful diving slap tag to get the
head-first-sliding Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   It was still 4-3 heading into the top of the fifth inning. And
Nomo quickly recorded the first two outs. But Winn walked on a 3-1
pitch and then took third on a Quinton McCracken bloop single to
left. With runners on first and third, Nomo threw two quick strikes
past Boggs. But before his 0-2 pitch, Nomo lurched forward from the
stretch and the home-plate umpire, Mark Hirschbeck, immediately
called a balk.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously shaken, Nomo ended up walking Boggs to put runners on
first and second. But McGriff took an 0-2 pitch for a called strike
three. And Nomo was finished for the night. &QL;

DIETER ROTH, 68, ARTIST AND PROVOCATEUR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Switzerland)  (mk) 
 By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dieter Roth, a prolific, notoriously irascible, reclusive and
eccentric German-born artist-provocateur who built a formidable
reputation in Europe but remained something of a mystery in
America, in part because he permitted his work to be exhibited here
even more rarely than there, died on Saturday in Basel,
Switzerland, where he had a home. He was 68.
</P>
<P>
   He had heart problems, Carol Eckman, his New York dealer, said.
</P>
<P>
   Roth was a sculptor, performer, book designer, poet, graphic
artist, publisher and musician, sort of. Born Karl-Dietrich Roth in
Germany in 1930, the son of a sugar beet farmer, he and a brother
were sent for safekeeping in 1943 to Switzerland, a country that
has always seemed to attract and cultivate people of nomadic and
unusual temperament like him. He settled at a hostel for refugees
in Zurich, where he stayed for four years and studied Greek, Latin
and French at the local secondary school.
</P>
<P>
   He began to exhibit in 1958. With fellow artists Hermann Nitsch
and Gunter Brus, he did improvisatory concerts of cacophonous
music. He staged a concert of howling dogs. Once he collaborated
with Richard Hamilton, the English artist, on an exhibition
exclusively for dogs (the pictures, of sausages and other images he
thought would be of special interest to them, were hung at dog-eye
level).
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, he founded the Zeitschrift fur Alles, a journal that
published anything submitted to it. In Los Angeles, he conceived an
installation of 40 suitcases filled with different types of cheese.
He often made sculptures out of fugitive materials like baked
dough, chocolate, mayonnaise and rabbit droppings (fortunately, not
all at the same time). Their natural deterioration, which he
equated with his own death, became an integral part of his art.
</P>
<P>
   All of this situated Roth within a postwar European scene that
included Joseph Beuys, Yves Klein, Lucio Fontana and others who
experimented with unorthodox techniques and who generally tried to
blur the boundaries between performance and sculpture, theater and
visual art, high culture and low.
</P>
<P>
   He was perhaps best known as a maker of multifarious
artist-books, hundreds of them. (One was as small as the eraser on
a pencil; another, ``Literaturwurst,'' consisted of various
periodicals chopped up, mixed with lard and spices and stuffed into
a sausage casing.)
</P>
<P>
   He was famously reclusive and difficult, notwithstanding his
friendships with artists. It was through Daniel Spoerri, for
instance, that he met various members of the irreverent movement
called Fluxus. Roth's link to Fluxus involved, among other things,
his interest in music and sound, in ephemeral materials and in an
anarchic kind of pranksterish humor.
</P>
<P>
   But the dark undertone and furious, obsessive energy of his work
ultimately separated him from many of the more lighthearted Fluxus
artists. Perhaps despite himself, he was a fluent draftsman and
expert printmaker, and his drawings and prints contained his wild
energy within peculiarly virtuosic forms. Compared to the
innumerable self-described artists of the last several decades who
faked their way through his sort of work, Roth was the genuine
item.
</P>
<P>
   By nature he was tireless to the point of neurosis, and, among
other things, this led him to experiment with numerous untested
materials and techniques. ``When I was young I wanted to become a
real artist,'' Roth once reflected. ``Then I started doing
something I felt wasn't real art, and it was through this that I
became a well-known artist.''
</P>
<P>
   For his only American retrospective, at the Museum of
Contemporary Art in Chicago in 1984, he agreed to attend the
opening because much of what was on view belonged to a friend. But
otherwise he was prickly about exhibitions. For his last show in
New York, at the Nolan/Eckman Gallery earlier this year, he
declined to cooperate. Throughout his life he refused to play the
role of the eager artist responding to a gallery or museum. It was,
to him, a matter of pride and independence.
</P>
<P>
   In later years he moved between Basel and Iceland, where he
lived in a remote house on a lake and also in Reykjavik. He is
survived by two sons, Karl and Bjorn, and a daughter, Vera, and
nine grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he would like to be remembered after his death, Roth
said, ``Here lies the carcass of a man who didn't know who he was
and where he was heading.''

   LOS ANGELES _ In a promotion sure to cause a major brain freeze
or two in overeager customers, Baskin-Robbins is giving away free
Cappuccino Blasts at 180 of its ice cream stores after 5 p.m.
today.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it wants to say thanks to customers for
supporting them over the years.
</P>
<P>
   By giving away the coffee-flavored ice cream drink,
Baskin-Robbins also wants to tell consumers that its stores sell
more than traditional frozen treats, a spokesman said. In recent
years, the company has expanded its menu of beverages to include
smoothies and a variety of ice cream coffee beverages.
</P>
<P>
   The company's Cappuccino Blast faces competition from the likes
of Starbucks and Coffee Bean &AMP; Tea Leaf, which serve iced coffee
drinks, and rivals like Jamba Juice and the Juice Club for its
smoothies.
</P>
<P>
   Baskin-Robbins expects to give away 30,000 gallons of Cappuccino
Blast today. To find the nearest participating store, call (800)

   No surprise there. Perhaps the Red Sox player best qualified to
put that ninth-inning collapse in perspective is Bret Saberhagen,
the man with the collapsible shoulder who Tuesday night made Monday
feel like ancient history with a 9-3 win over the Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen, pitching in Atlanta for the first time since he
tried to work on fumes for the expansion Colorado Rockies in the
1995 playoffs and was clobbered by the eventual World Series
winners, did not walk a batter and struck out seven in seven
innings for his third straight win and eighth overall this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played a perfect eight innings (Monday night) and lost,''
Saberhagen said. ``To lose a game like that, when we've been on the
other end of those games a lot more ... I think a lot of guys
probably had nightmares. I know I did.
</P>
<P>
   ``With an experienced ball club like the Braves, when you've got
'em on the ropes, you've got to pull the noose nice and tight.''
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen, pitching on that rare night when his opposite
number, 43-year-old Dennis Martinez, was older than he is (by nine
years), departed with an 8-3 lead. That's the same-sized cushion
that was not enough for Derek Lowe and the Red Sox the night
before, when Tom Gordon was unmasked as mortal.
</P>
<P>
   But this time the Red Sox added one more run on a walk and the
last of their 13 hits, a double by Darren Bragg, who also tripled
and scored Boston's first run in the first and singled home the
final run in a five-run fourth.
</P>
<P>
   So it was 9-3 when Jim Corsi, Saberhagen's personal valet, took
the mound for the final two innings. They passed without incident,
dashing the hopes of a Turner Field crowd of 43,121 that saw the
Braves lose for only the ninth time in 35 home games this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a pretty good handoff, to have it 9-3,'' Corsi said.
``Sabes bowed his neck again, and we played a great game
defensively. What I did was minuscule.'
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, a native of Nicaragua, was bidding to make history in
front of his country's president, Arnoldo Aleman. One more win and
Martinez can claim more victories than any other Latin American
pitcher in big league history, surpassing Dominican Juan Marichal,
who has 243.
</P>
<P>
   But it did not come on the Red Sox' watch. Let's hope that when
it does come, it doesn't take as long as Carl Yastrzemski's 400th
home run, or Nicaragua may be faced with government by proxy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see him get his record,'' Saberhagen said of El
Presidente, which is Mr. Aleman's title but Senor Martinez's
nickname. ``I just didn't want to see him get it tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen, who gave up seven hits and all three Atlanta runs,
one on Danny Bautista's pinch homer, went out on a high note as
second baseman Mike Benjamin made the night's best defensive play _
a sprawling stop of Walt Weiss's bid for a hit after a two-out
single by pinch hitter Ozzie Guillen.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's defense deserted him in the fourth, when the Red Sox
scored five runs, four unearned, aided by two errors and Atlanta's
inability to turn a double play.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn, whose nine-game hitting streak came to an end the
night before, grounded a single up the middle to open the inning.
Troy O'Leary followed with a grounder to third baseman Chipper
Jones, but first base umpire Randy Marsh ruled that O'Leary just
beat Tony Graffanino's relay on the attempted double play.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez could have helped himself if he'd been able to field
John Valentin's sharp comebacker, but the best he could do was
knock the ball down, and Valentin reached on the infield hit. A
walk to Scott Hatteberg loaded the bases, and Benjamin followed
with a high chopper over the mound that Graffanino tried in vain to
short-hop with a backhanded swipe.
</P>
<P>
   Graffanino was charged with a tough error as two runs scored to
make it 3-1. Saberhagen fouled off a third-strike bunt attempt for
the inning's second out, but Darren Lewis singled up the middle for
another run, and when center fielder Andruw Jones overran the ball,
Benjamin scored to make it 5-1.
</P>
<P>
   Bragg's line single to left made it 6-1, but the inning ended
when Chipper Jones cut off the throw to the plate and nailed Bragg
at first base.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an important win for us, to get our confidence going
again,'' said Saberhagen, whose last three wins have followed
Boston losses, including one that could have required group
therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry, Vaughn said: ``This team didn't make too much of
(Monday night). We just didn't cash in. We went out there tonight,
Bret pitched a brilliant game, and (we) cashed in this time.''

RED SOX PUT UP A BRAVE EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ What ninth inning? What five-run lead? What
embarrassing loss? What Monday Night Horror Theater? Oh, that? Hey,
pal, this is baseball. We play one-six-two. You can't be worrying
about anything that happens in one baseball game, not when it's
early June and you still have 101 games to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always have a saying before a game,'' explained Darren
Bragg. ```Yesterday doesn't mean anything.' It doesn't matter
whether you go 4 for 4 or 0 for 5. Every day you start all over.''
</P>
<P>
   Easy for him to say. He had a single, double, and triple as the
Red Sox shrugged off that ninth-inning Monday night disaster with a
crisp 9-3 Tuesday night dispatch of the Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   It was all in place for Jimy's Kids Tuesday night. The offense
came through with 13 hits. The defense was superb. Bret Saberhagen
and Jim Corsi were efficient on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   For all we know, everybody probably even smelled good.
</P>
<P>
   They've played 18 innings here at Turner Field these past two
nights, and the plain gospel truth is that the Boston Red Sox have
kicked the stuff out of the Atlanta Braves in 17 of them. And if
you want to go back to Saturday's 1-0 loss to the Mets, a further
unarguable premise is that the Red Sox have played four excellent
baseball games in succession, even if all they have to show for
their efforts are two wins. If they continue to play this type of
baseball, they will win a lot of games and they will be the
American League wild-card team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in the games we lost,'' said Mo Vaughn, who had two more
line-drive hits Tuesday, ``we've played solid baseball. We're now
getting some runs, and the pitching has been great. They're
throwing strikes and keeping runners off base.''
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen maintained that he and some others had ``nightmares''
about the horrifying events of Monday, but Vaughn was not one of
them. He looked at the weird goings-on as just one of those things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night was a different kind of situation,'' Vaughn pointed
out. ``We did all the right things to put ourselves in a position
to win the game. We just didn't carry it through. I've been saying
all along that Flash (Tom Gordon) has been perfect and that the
streak had to end some night. But overall, we've been playing good
baseball and we carried it over again tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox kicked off their visit to Turner Field with a
thorough dismantling of Tom Glavine Monday night. The hitters were
told to go the other way, and they did as they were told. They
didn't go for his teases in the dirt, either. They made Glavine
come to them, at least insofar as the crafty lefthander will ever
come to anybody. Glavine has made a living out of never giving in
to batters. Even on 3-and-0, he will concede nothing. More often
than not, he will win the battle of the wills. Monday night was a
rare exception.
</P>
<P>
   Equally inspiring was the pitching of Derek Lowe and the
accompanying pitch-calling of Jason Varitek.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jason did a great job of concentrating and executing the game
plan,'' lauded pitching coach Joe Kerrigan.
</P>
<P>
   The ninth inning? You know, it wasn't even that bad. Gordon took
the shovel out and placed himself in the ground with a pair of
walks, and that set the tone. All season long, he has pounced on
guys. We haven't had that Heathcliff Slocumb Perils of Pauline
stuff. Gordon normally comes in and starts everyone out 0-and-2,
1-and-2. He goes 1-2-3 and you don't even have to sweat out last
call. Monday was different. Monday was aberrational.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the Braves weren't exactly bashing the ball around
the lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a couple of chinks here and there,'' said Bragg.
``They did in the ninth what we've been doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox are playing as if they wouldn't mind settling in
here for a spell. We still haven't had a concentrated stretch of
good baseball weather in Boston, but the last two nights here have
been ideal. It was in the mid-70s Monday, and Tuesday was just a
flat-out great night to play baseball. It was warm, with just a
hint of humidity. It felt the way a baseball park should feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perfect baseball weather,'' agreed Bragg. ``It allows you to
work up a good sweat so you get nice and loose. Perfect baseball
weather. Exactly.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a team that has just built a nice 7-1 lead en route
to a 9-3 victory ought to be in a good mood. And a manager whose
reconstructed second starter has just won his third straight game
following a team loss ought to be grateful for the presence of a
stopper.
</P>
<P>
   That's assuming he actually knew that he had a stopper.
</P>
<P>
   ``See, you're educating me,'' said the ever affable Jimy
Williams. ``I didn't realize that. All I know is that his last
three starts have been outstanding. His arm is free, he's throwing
nice breaking balls, and he's working both sides of the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams could have sat around and talked about all the good
things he saw, starting with Saberhagen's performance, Bragg's
tone-setting triple in the first, and the great diving stop Mike
Benjamin made in the seventh to take away a hit from Walt Weiss. He
knows better than to gloat. There's another game tonight. And then
another. And another.
</P>
<P>
   I guarantee you that Williams would back up Darren Bragg. When
it comes to figuring out what might happen tonight, yesterday
doesn't mean anything. But at least Jimy knows in his heart and
mind that his team does know how to play this game.

RANGERS, HELLING SHUT DOWN ROCKIES, 5-2
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The Rangers' 61-day stranglehold on first place in the
American League West can be attributed partly to their performance
against those less fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers remain competitive against the best and continue to
dominate the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Last night's 5-2 victory against the Colorado Rockies at Coors
Field improved the Rangers' record to 29-15 (.659) against those
who entered play yesterday without a winning record.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to give a series away to those types of
teams,'' first baseman Will Clark said. ``If you go out and
execute, you're going to win more often than not. This team is very
capable of that.''
</P>
<P>
   This one required contributions from almost everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Rick Helling gave the Rangers 61/3 quality innings.
The bullpen pitched 22/3 scoreless innings. Clark and right fielder
Juan Gonzalez hit solo home runs, and the Rangers' Nos. 7 and 8
hitters _ shortstop Domingo Cedeno and third baseman Fernando Tatis
_ each drove in a run.
</P>
<P>
   Helling, who allowed a two-out, solo home run to first baseman
Todd Helton in the third inning, coasted through the fourth, fifth
and sixth innings. Helling (8-3) surrendered only one hit _ a
two-out, fourth-inning double by catcher Kirt Manwaring _ and
recorded five strikeouts during that stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think any good team expects to do well against a team that
might be struggling or isn't playing as well as it should,'' said
Helling, who gave up two runs on five hits and five walks. ``You
want to take advantage of those situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Helling, though, lost command of the strike zone in the seventh
inning. Jason Bates opened the inning with a single, and Helling
issued consecutive one-out walks to pinch hitter John Vander Wal
and center fielder Curtis Goodwin to load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers manager Johnny Oates summoned right-hander Xavier
Hernandez from the bullpen after the walk to Goodwin. Rockies
manager Don Baylor countered by sending catcher Jeff Reed, a
left-handed hitter, to pinch hit for struggling second baseman Mike
Lansing.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez retired Reed on strikes with three pitches, but he,
too, would struggle with command. Helton drew a bases-loaded walk
for the Rockies' second run, which brought third baseman Vinny
Castilla to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Castilla, who entered the game with 22 home runs, represented
the potential go-ahead run and worked the count full, but Hernandez
struck him out on a slider.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers took advantage of the Rockies' mistakes in the
fourth inning. Right-hander John Thomson (5-6) fell behind in the
count to Gonzalez, who deposited a second-pitch fastball into the
left-field seats to give the Rangers a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Thomson then issued a walk to Clark, who advanced to third on
the ensuing single by catcher Ivan Rodriguez. Right fielder Dante
Bichette allowed Rodriguez to advance to second when his throw
sailed high above the cutoff man.
</P>
<P>
   Clark scored on the sacrifice fly by Cedeno, and Tatis drove in
Rodriguez with a one-out single to right field to give the Rangers
a 4-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers chased Thomson during their next at-bat with their
third consecutive three-hit inning. Clark's one-out, run-scoring
single gave Helling a four-run lead with which to work.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers wasted three hits in the third inning after
consecutive singles by Helling and center fielder Tom Goodwin. The
Rockies, who trailed 1-0 after a second-inning home run by Clark,
expected a sacrifice-bunt attempt from Rangers second baseman Luis
Alicea.
</P>
<P>
   Helton and Castilla charged for the bunt, but Lansing worked his
way behind Helling at second base. Thomson wheeled and delivered an
accurate throw to Lansing, who tagged Helling for the pickoff.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers further ran out of what once appeared to be a
potential big inning when Manwaring retired Goodwin attempting to
steal second base on the ensuing pitchout. Alicea later would
deliver a single, but three base hits during the inning went for
naught.

</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, June 10:
</P>
<P>
   The Senate majority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, has been
carving out some interesting political territory for the
Republicans. In recent days he has denounced legislation aimed at
curbing teen-age smoking and suggested that the best response to
school shootings was more guns. When both parties are supposed to
be pursuing the women's vote, it is unusual to see a politician
promote a survival-of-the-fittest theory of child-rearing.
</P>
<P>
   Lott takes premises that most people agree with _ new taxes are
undesirable, adults should be allowed to own guns _ and elevates
them to immutable laws. Consistency is all, rationality is for
sissies. Defending the cause of states' rights recently, Lott spoke
out against a national drunken-driving standard by arguing that it
was wrong for the Federal Government to say ``do it our way or we
will punish you.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott's recent denunciations of anti-tobacco legislation as a
``spending bill'' that deserves to be interred has been
particularly peculiar. The Republican-controlled Senate Commerce
Committee voted 19 to 1 to approve the measure, which is aimed at
reducing teen-age smoking. Then Senate Republicans led by Lott
began denouncing the bill as too much big government and seemed
determined to see it fail. Despite some signs of revival on
Tuesday, the legislation's future is far from certain.
</P>
<P>
   Taking time out from these retrograde legislative efforts, Lott
marched to the National Rifle Association convention and vowed to
oppose any effort to tighten gun-control laws. Parents everywhere
have been horrified by the repeated scenes of weeping students at
schools shot up by classmates who have easily obtained
military-quality weapons. In response, many lawmakers have demanded
trigger locks and requirements that gun owners store weapons where
children cannot get at them. But Lott, whose own state has been hit
by schoolyard murders, told the NRA that the real key to change was
``a well-armed public.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican legislative leaders should be defining the agenda and
tone of this fall's campaign in a way that appeals to sensible
Americans. Instead Newt Gingrich is busy plotting against campaign
finance reform, while Lott seems to have been trying to protect the
rights of children to get their hands on guns and cigarettes. At
least no one can accuse them of pandering to the soccer moms.

HUMPBACKS EXTEND USUAL VISIT OFF COAST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DON HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABOARD THE VANGUARD _ Beyond the confines of land, 22 miles past
the breakwater at Ventura, the 68-foot Vanguard eases toward a pair
of adult humpback whales.
</P>
<P>
   The ship's engines quiet. Chamber music plays. All eyes on board
scan the surface of the water.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, an enormous mass approaches the boat from below and
rises to the surface. Its dual blowholes send a misty plume of
foul-smelling breath into the air.
</P>
<P>
   In an oddly graceful move for a creature its size, the whale
arcs its back to display its tell-tale hump. Then it dives under
the boat for a better, sonar-view of the curious vessel of
landlubbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told you, they like Vivaldi,'' quipped the ship's captain,
Glen Galbraith, a veteran of the whale-watching business who is
armed with a ready supply of one-liners.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-ton, 40-foot whale swims from one side of the ship to the
other, perhaps a dozen times, as a crowd of usually jaded
journalists scramble like excited children to watch this
spectacular animal do nothing more than look back.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's studying us as much as we're studying him,'' Galbraith
said. ``This whale is actually playing with us.''
</P>
<P>
   The humpbacks have returned to the Santa Barbara Channel.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the gray whales that pass by the California Coast twice
each year, these humpbacks are here to hang out a while.
</P>
<P>
   And this year, the krill and plankton that the whales crave are
closer to the mainland, says Jacob Emmons, a naturalist for Island
Packers, a Ventura charter company specializing in whale-watching
and nature tours.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a big spring plankton bloom, so that's why they're
here,'' said Emmons, who never ceases to be awed by the animals.
</P>
<P>
   It's not quite clear what accounts for the bumper crop of sea
life. Some suspect that winter's rainstorms washed fertilizer-rich
runoff, on which plankton and krill feed, into the sea. Others
think the whales are simply becoming more accustomed to people and
are venturing closer to shore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It approached us and made contact with us. That's pretty
special,'' said Emmons, still awestruck, 10 minutes after getting
up close and personal with the curious humpback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it puts (life) in perspective, to look at a majestic
whale,'' he continued. ``It's kind of an honor to feel so
insignificant in the presence of such a majestic animal. It makes
you re-evaluate who you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Once thought to have numbered 100,000, the humpbacks almost have
been hunted into extinction. After receiving worldwide protection
in 1966, their numbers have slowly increased. Today, the humpback
population is estimated at 10,000 to 12,000, according to the
National Parks Service, which manages the Channel Islands National
Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like year after year we see more humpback whales,''
said Galbraith. ``The first 10 years I ran boats in the channel, I
saw one blue whale. Now, it's not that uncommon. And the gray
whales are almost guaranteed. We know where they go and it's almost
become that way with the humpbacks and blue whales.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, the whales started returning to feeding grounds
north of Santa Rosa Island, some 45 miles southwest of Ventura.
This year, some of the first humpbacks were spotted about a week
ago _ and much closer to shore. By the end of the month, the
population is expected to once again jump to last year's level of
nearly 300 humpbacks.
</P>
<P>
   A pod of 50 blue whales, the largest living animal to inhabit
the planet, was spotted recently heading up the coast from San
Diego.

RED WINGS WIN LACKLUSTER STANLEY CUP OPENER 
</HEADLINE>
 WINGS-CAPITALS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Hockey's shining moment lacked something in luster
Tuesday night. The Red Wings and Capitals, the best and brightest
of the Original 26, spent the better part of 60 minutes looking
like 40 characters in search of a play.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it looked more like a dress rehearsal than an
Opening Night sensation.
</P>
<P>
   But here in Hockey Town, no one was arguing the final outcome:
Red Wings 2, Capitals 1. The Red Wings, before a sellout crowd of
19,983 at Joe Louis Arena, inched one win closer to their second
Stanley Cup in as many years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can talk all you want, but now you see what it's all
about,'' said Detroit coach Scotty Bowman, who cautioned earlier in
the day not to get caught up in the hype that had his club easily
repeating as the champ. ``I thought Washington played very well for
being in the finals for the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, it was a night when neither club's most skilled players
did much to figure in the outcome. The Wings scored their two goals
in a span of 2:14 of the first period, Joey Kocur and Nicklas
Lidstrom taking advantage of some sloppy play by the Capitals.
Richard Zednik, the 249th pick in the '94 draft, scored
Washington's lone goal with 4:03 left in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Noticeable nonfactors for the Capitals: Adam Oates, Sergei
Gonchar, Brian Bellows, and Peter Bondra. For the Wings, superstar
Sergei Fedorov was anything but a key component and Brendan
Shanahan again went 0-0_0. The bedeviled power forward has gone
nine consecutive games without a point, his longest drought in a
decade. This spell is generating rumors that he is injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually thought the first 10 minutes we played quite
well,'' said Washington coach Ron Wilson. ``There were just a
couple of shifts there when our first and second lines got
outplayed by their third and fourth lines _ we got a little casual
with the puck, a little lackadaisical _ and they made us pay.''
</P>
<P>
   The immediate cost was a Kocur goal with 14:04 gone in the
first. The noted tough guy raced to the crease and provided a
redirect to a Doug Brown feed after Tomas Holmstrom made the key
play, forcing the puck into the zone off a turnover and getting
crunched at the blue line as he crossed into the offensive end.
</P>
<P>
   Next, with 3:42 to go before the break, Lidstrom fired in a
slapper with Holmstrom camped in front of goalie Olaf Kolzig. The
wide-shouldered Holmstrom didn't allow the Washington netminder a
glimpse of the steaming Lidstrom shot, a screening tactic the Wings
attempted to repeat over the course of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traffic in front of me,'' said Kolzig. ``There wasn't much I
could do. They're such a deep team, with so many guys with the
ability to put the puck in the net.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wings finished with a lopsided 31-17 shot advantage. But
neither side had an abundance of true scoring chances (perhaps
seven for the Wings and five for the Capitals). It's execution,
skating, and passing that lead to good chances. But with the
skilled players either undermotivated or otherwise detained by
checkers, execution wasn't part of the act.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hung in long enough and we started to believe,'' said
Wilson, who could be heard on the bench trying to provide an
emotional jump start for his squad. ``We could see they're a team
just like us. In the end, we lost, 2-1, but we don't feel we were
dominated, not by any stretch of the imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowman blamed himself, in part, for his Wings' tepid play,
especially in the second period when Zednik cut it to 2-1. He
didn't like his line combinations. He felt his players may have
been confused by his pairings and matchups. Not a good night, said
the man who has coached no fewer than seven Cup champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think I had a good game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But even on an off night, the Wings stayed on course. What
mattered most, perhaps, was that their netminder, Chris Osgood,
didn't allow one of the long, soft goals that have plagued him in
the playoffs. Kolzig also looked sharp. On a night when everything
around them was shaky, they stood secure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just look at his record,'' said Bowman, referring to Osgood,
who is playing in his first finals. ``It speaks for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   One act finished. It can only get better.

NOMOMANINA COMES TO NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ His new home is 3,000 miles east of sunny California.
But Hideo Nomo might as well be back in Japan pitching in the Tokyo
Dome. It feels the same: fun.
</P>
<P>
   In Nomo's debut as a New York Met Tuesday night, Shea Stadium
was a jukebox that held 30,336 fans, most of them used to the din
of rock music and low-flying jets. Noise _ the kind you expect to
hear at a Knicks game in Madison Square Garden _ stung the ears.
The joint was jumping as he took the mound against the Tampa Bay
Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
   ``No-mo, No-mo!'' was the chant from the crowd and on the huge
video screen after every one of his five strikeouts. He didn't get
a victory _ Tampa Bay won, 5-4, in 11 innings _ but Nomo had to be
uplifted by his reception.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo was far from perfect; the former Dodger hadn't pitched in
10 days. Ahead, 4-3, in the fifth, Nomo balked in a run. He broke
his hands winding up, then stepped off the mound. Sound familiar?
(Tim Wakefield would have protested this one, too.)
</P>
<P>
   He left after five innings with the score tied, 4-4. Nomo gave
up five hits and walked three. Five New York pitchers followed him,
but they couldn't prevent the Devil Rays from spoiling the party in
extras.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a fresh beginning,'' said Nomo. ``The players on our
bench haven't had a chance to see me too much. I want them to have
confidence in my pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All things considered, I liked what I saw,'' said Mets manager
Bobby Valentine. ``But there is room for improvement, that's for
sure. He's had a long rest, but the health is there, and that's
good. Without the balk, it's 4-3 and we win in regulation.''
</P>
<P>
   The winning run scored on Quinton McCracken's sacrifice fly in
the 11th, after the Mets had the potential go-ahead run thrown out
at the plate in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   But on this night, the game details were secondary. Nomo took
his place in a baseball setting that has been starved for a
prime-time pitcher since the days of David Cone, Bret Saberhagen,
and Doc Gooden.
</P>
<P>
   Mets fans prefer to think of Nomo as the pitcher who was
National League Rookie of the Year in 1995 and compiled a 43-29
record over the last three-plus seasons _ not the disgruntled 2-7
hurler who asked for and received a trade out of Los Angeles
Thursday. Maybe now the New York papers will take notice of the
other team in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like this is my first start,'' said Nomo. ``You have
to look at this long-term. I'm a little disappointed. We didn't win
the game. I need to improve my control.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Nomo is new in town, he is not lacking for acquaintances
in the Mets clubhouse. He and Masato Yoshii pitched for the
Kintetsu Buffaloes from 1990-94 before Nomo found a loophole in his
contract and left as a free agent. Valentine used to manage Chiba
Lotte of the Japan League. And Nomo's catcher with the Dodgers,
Mike Piazza, was acquired by the Mets recently after being traded
to the Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy with my new teammates,'' said Nomo. ``This is a very
good team.''
</P>
<P>
   Nomo is used to pressure; he has been under scrutiny since
coming to the majors, not only from the media hordes but from his
homeland. And now he's on the biggest stage of all.

FORMER PRESIDENT FACES POSSIBLE KIDNAPPING CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ Former President Jorge Rafael Videla,
who had previously been pardoned for his role in the disappearances
of thousands of political dissidents from 1976 to 1983, was
detained on Tuesday and could face charges of child kidnapping, the
government announced.
</P>
<P>
   The junta leader was detained late in the day on orders from a
federal judge after several parents of children missing from the
``dirty war'' brought complaints against the 71-year-old retired
general, accusing him of having ordered the kidnappings of children
and then offering them for adoption to military families.
</P>
<P>
   The detention was a stunning surprise and promised to open an
additional chapter in a long-running battle between human rights
officials and the administration of President Carlos Saul Menem,
who has said he believes that the nation should move beyond the
sordid history of the military juntas.
</P>
<P>
   The army chief was sentenced to life in prison in 1987 for human
rights abuses that occurred during his dictatorship. He served
several years before Menem pardoned him in 1990. In an apparent
tradeoff, Menem was then able to cut the military budget as one
means of tackling the overspending and hyperinflation afflicting
the country at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Videla could face charges of stealing children and having them
illegally adopted under his rule, according to a court spokesman,
who added that he could serve 3 to 25 years in prison if convicted.
A total of five children whose parents disappeared after having
been kidnapped by military death squads were illegally adopted, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Detention under Argentine law is short of an arrest. Videla
faces several legal proceedings before he would actually be
arrested and face formal charges.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the children whom he is accused of stealing were
apparently born in secret prisons around Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
   At least 15,000 people were killed and ``disappeared'' in the
so-called dirty war against guerrillas and suspected leftists.
Human rights officials say up to 30,000 people were killed under a
series of military juntas.
</P>
<P>
   The police took Videla from his house on Tuesday night for
questioning by Federal Judge Roberto Marquevich in connection with
accusations of ``illegal appropriation of minors,'' according to
television reports.
</P>
<P>
   Abel Madariaga, the husband of a woman who disappeared in 1977
when she was four months pregnant, said in a television interview
that he always knew from witnesses' reports that his wife had given
birth to a boy while in custody at the Campo de Mayo military base
outside Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that my son was given away like many others,'' he said.

BUHNER ADMITS NERVOUSNESS IN CLASS AAA REHAB ASSIGNMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TACOMA, Wash. _ Jay Buhner rolled into Cheney Stadium Tuesday
with all the trappings of a big-leaguer. The $75,000 black Hummer.
The personalized bats. The Kingdome clubhouse attendant in tow.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Mariner right fielder, on a two-day rehab assignment to
test his surgically repaired left knee, was an easy fit with the
Class AAA Tacoma Rainiers. He sat and joked with his newfound
teammates. He brought food.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, Buhner, in these lesser surroundings, let people
know he wasn't too good for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm nervous, no doubt about it,'' he said before taking the
field against the New Orleans Zephyrs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really nervous. I'm sure it will be that way every at-bat.
The thing I'm nervous about is nobody wants to embarrass himself.
And I haven't slid yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Buhner started in right field, batted fifth and played six
innings at Cheney Stadium in his first game in nearly two months.
He will play another for the Rainiers tonight, then fly to Oakland
tomorrow morning and rejoin the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   With his Seattle club fading fast, the 33-year-old slugger says
he has been reluctant to speak out. Even now, he won't criticize
anyone. But he is a realist about the damage done.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't point fingers,'' he said. ``It takes a team, and
we've been losing as a team. It's come to a head right now. No
doubt there's some frustration in the clubhouse. It's going to be
extremely tough to fight back from where we are. We've dug a hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows what anybody's going to do. Anything could happen.
That's ownership.''
</P>
<P>
   Buhner's appearance Tuesday was well received. The paid
attendance was more than double the 3,600 average. Gates were
opened at 4:30 p.m. rather than 6 to allow fans to watch the celeb
take batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   The bald one didn't disappoint, driving six of his 23 pitches
out of the ballpark. Two hit the scoreboard in left-center, one
slamming off the top of it, well over 400 feet away. Another struck
a light standard. Rainier players witnessing these feats could only
giggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you see that?'' center fielder Shane Monahan asked
excitedly after Buhner's most pronounced scoreboard blast. ``That
was the hardest ball I've ever seen hit. It took the ``s'' off
Rainiers.''
</P>
<P>
   Buhner had a corner locker awaiting him, complete with nameplate
and a new number (49). He ended up wearing his own Mariner jersey
(19) after Rainiers first baseman Randy Jorgenson volunteered to
wear something other than his normal digits.
</P>
<P>
   After backing his Hummer into a parking spot, Buhner was greeted
by seven autograph hounds and Kevin Kalal, the Rainiers' director
of baseball operations. His equipment already was stored in a
locker, compliments of Mariner clubhouse attendant Jam Spears.
Unfortunately, Buhner's batting helmet was left behind, forcing the
attendant to make an unscheduled 70-mile round trip in rush-hour
traffic to retrieve it.
</P>
<P>
   Buhner spent considerable time in the training room before
joining the other Rainiers in the clubhouse. They talked fishing,
his brother (a Mariner farmhand in Memphis) and Mariner troubles.
</P>
<P>
   He borrowed chewing tobacco from Raul Ibanez. He met with
Rainiers manager Dave Myers. He was scolded by coach Dave Brundage
for coming out late for stretching exercises.
</P>
<P>
   During BP, Buhner's cuts were so vicious he knocked the batting
cage supports loose with a foul ball. The contraption had to be
pulled down and put back together, delaying things.
</P>
<P>
   Buhner met with reporters for 20 minutes, signed autographs for
fans for another 20. He is noticeably bigger, having added 10
pounds of muscle, increasing his weight to 236. He says his health
is 85 percent and doesn't expect to be at full capacity the rest of
the summer. He is mulling right knee surgery in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   He said and did all the right things as he spent his first day
in the minors in nine years. Cheney Stadium even got a compliment.
With grass, not Astroturf, you know that had to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ```This place is really nice, nicer than some of the places
we've played in the big leagues,'' Buhner said.

M'S OWNERSHIP A LITTLE UNKEMPT FOR COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ What a bad time to invite fellow owners to town.
</P>
<P>
   The place is a mess, the kids are being bad, there's no cash to
party.
</P>
<P>
   If it weren't for the fact that the lords of baseball are
themselves unzipped and zipless, they could spend their quarterly
meeting at the Four Seasons Olympic Hotel this week mocking
Mariners ownership (motto: ``We're Not the Florida Marlins!'').
</P>
<P>
   These business meetings follow uncomfortably upon the fumes of
the Randy Johnson trade stink, in which a week of speculation about
the fate of one of the game's most glamorous players ended in
national embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   When ownership got cold feet and pulled out of the trade,
leaving Johnson, vice president of baseball operations Woody
Woodward and manager Lou Piniella with varying degrees of fury,
annoyance and humiliation _ to say nothing of the Los Angeles
Dodgers, for whom it will be years before they deal again with the
Mariners _ it also provided a rare glimpse of ownership's disunity
and lack of vision.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the Johnson debacle, which has been a runaway
truck for nearly a year, is money, not relief pitchers or left
fielders. And the heart of the money issue is not Johnson, but the
new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Although no one will admit it officially, the new insurance yard
is about to become a massive money pit for ownership.
</P>
<P>
   With its $25 million contingency fund already spent on the easy
part of the project that's little more than half done, the stadium
will end up so far over its $417 million budgeted cost that
knowledgeable King County employees have estimated the ownership
will be on the hook for $70 million to $100 million in cost
overruns for the most expensive ballpark in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   You might recall about the only thing that worked in the
public's favor in the legislative capitulation over the stadium
financing was a cap on the public's contribution at $336 million.
The owners agreed to absorb all cost overruns, and recently
reiterated their intent to stick to those terms.
</P>
<P>
   Not that they had a choice. As one county staffer put it, ``They
wouldn't get one foot inside the door before getting thrown out.''
</P>
<P>
   A major extra expense for the stadium has been change orders,
the result of designing a stadium while it goes up. Ownership's
insistence on a July 1999 opening has created such a construction
rush that much is being built on the fly.
</P>
<P>
   Ownership was so aghast at the overrun projections that it
recently conducted a private audit of the Public Facilities
District that oversees the project. Although the results were not
shared, the Mariners have not yet publicly screamed, ``Ripoff!''
But with these guys, never say never.
</P>
<P>
   The consequence for the team on the field was that no further
investments would be made, since ownership already was claiming red
ink in annual operations.
</P>
<P>
   As it always has been with this ownership, every capital call
requires that at least some of the owners sell some of their
Microsoft stock, which because of its historic rapid increase in
value is considered at least double money. And their share of the
ballpark's cost will have to be paid mostly by the end of
construction.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Nintendo's Japanese investors have reason to want
out. The company's fortunes have sagged not only with the imploding
Japanese economy but with the American success of its rival, Sega.
</P>
<P>
   If Microsoft's Chris Larson decides to buy out his Japanese
partners, he will need either lots of cash or new investors. But
the summer of 1998 is a wretched time to be attracting new partners
to the Mariners, since the ballpark expenses are uncapped and the
income stream from luxury suites and seat licenses is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   The result is paralysis that stymied the Johnson trade. Some
owners don't want to pay Johnson market value, yet they don't want
to squander a franchise asset, as they have done several times in
recent seasons. Aware of the bind, other baseball people figured to
pillage a franchise under duress.
</P>
<P>
   So, rather than risk yet another personnel mistake, ownership
lost its guts and did nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem with getting nothing for Johnson is that
there is no other player who has value that would be worth trading
to fix any one of the Mariners' numerous shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   Getting no fixes not only risks seasonal disaster, it begets a
bigger problem _ diminished sales for a new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The rule of thumb among marketers of new sports stadiums and
arenas is that there is one chance to do it right: the first time.
If the Mariners swing from 90 wins last year to 90 losses this
season, which is entirely possible given the mess ownership has
made of Johnson, momentum for the new park will be damaged in spite
of the novelty of outdoor baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Raiders owner Al Davis' marketing disaster with the remodeled
Oakland Coliseum is a stinging example of how not to sell expensive
seats for new digs. The Raiders will take years to recover.
</P>
<P>
   Caught between two massive expenses of team payroll and a new
stadium, paralyzed by lack of unanimity and vision, the Mariner
ownership sits inert, holding on to the chair for dear life.

DODGERS BEAT A'S
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It seems hard to believe that less than three
weeks ago, Chan Ho Park sat crunched in his locker, doubting his
fastball and his confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Since lasting just two innings that night in Arizona, Park has
regained the form that made him one of the National League's top
young right-handers. For the Dodgers it could not have come at a
better time.
</P>
<P>
   With struggling Oakland and Colorado on the schedule during this
very winnable six-game homestand, Park won Tuesday night for the
first time since May 13 with an overpowering 5-1 victory over the
A's in front of 46,244 at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't gain them a game in the standings since the San
Francisco Giants won their 11th straight, but after losing Monday
to the last place A's, the Dodgers were in a good mood again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of confidence tonight,'' said Park, who retired
the first 10 A's he faced. ``My inside fastballs were good. I had a
fever yesterday and I was aching all over, but I feel great
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Dodgers are expected to lose Eric Young, the
major-league leader with 26 stolen bases, for a few days after he
aggravated a thigh injury, Park's performance made the night almost
seamless.
</P>
<P>
   He pitched eight innings and allowed just one run, a
fifth-inning homer to former teammate Mike Blowers. But the Dodgers
already led 5-0 at that point and hardly seemed phased.
</P>
<P>
   Park's success on Tuesday stemmed from his fastball, a pitch he
once believed would not get him through the tough spots. The
Dodgers also have had that problem with tonight's starter Ismael
Valdes and saw it Saturday with their new fifth starter Dave
Mlicki.
</P>
<P>
   But Park, who struck out six and did not walk a batter, no
longer qualifies. The only help he needed was a 1-2-3 ninth from
Scott Radinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to give Park a lot of credit, he pitched a heck of
a game,'' A's manager Art Howe said. ``He's got a good arm, a very
good arm.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Monday night, when they never recovered after trailing
3-0 in the first, the Dodgers took advantage of Oakland mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Young opened the bottom of the first with a single against
right-hander Jimmy Haynes (4-3) and went to second when Scott
Spiezio misplayed Jose Vizcaino's grounder to the right side.
</P>
<P>
   Young rounded the bag but aggravated his strained right thigh
diving back. He scored on a passed ball but walked gingerly off the
field.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers added two more runs when Raul Mondesi walked, stole
second and came around to score when catcher Mike Macfarlane's
throw sailed into center. Vizcaino also scored on the play.
</P>
<P>
   Young singled again in the second, but Juan Castro took over at
second to begin the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Young missed three games after injuring the thigh in Chicago on
May 21 but returned to have a nine-game hitting streak and is
batting .372 (22 for 59) in 15 games since his return.
</P>
<P>
   Haynes, who lasted just four innings, issued walks to Bobby
Bonilla in the second and Charles Johnson in the fourth, and both
came around to score.
</P>
<P>
   That was more than enough for Park, who had a no decision in
last Thursday's 3-2 Dodgers victory against St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   In the start before that, he went eight innings in a game the
Dodgers lost 8-4 in 12 innings. That was the nightmare when Park
left after eight leading 4-2, but Scott Radinsky blew the lead in
the ninth and Dennis Rayes gave up five consecutive hits in the
12th.
</P>
<P>
   But it also was a turning point.
</P>
<P>
   Park rarely faced adversity during his breakout 1997 season,
when he went 8-1 in July and August on his way to a 14-victory
season.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this season, he came out of three games with a sore
lower back, but Tuesday that was not a problem. He winced in pain
when making a pitch to Macfarlane in the fifth. Even when he left
after eight, he held his back, but that was due more to the cold.
He even singled in the fourth, one of the ways he injured his back
earlier this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did what we asked tonight,'' manager Bill Russell said.
``He gave us innings and all of them were good.''

JORDAN'S WILL TO WIN SAVING BULLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The gerbil of a general manager craves equal billing.
The coach finds the secret of success while meditating in a tepee.
The tattooed goofball flies to Detroit, stealing the spotlight
while hanging out with Hulk Hogan. And the impending breakup
staggers along like a bad soap opera because the owner is gorged on
championships.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, they forget the obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these banners, all the rings,'' Steve Kerr said. ``Nobody
would have any of this if not for Michael.''
</P>
<P>
   Something has changed in this title bout, one that started out
as Ali-Frazier and digressed into Tyson-McNeeley. The Jazz, which
appeared ready to take the final step after gutting out a Game 1
victory, has turned to mush. The Bulls, who appeared ready for the
rocking chair and a long nap, should be tested for Viagra. The
series has tilted like a cheap pinball machine, and all because of
one man.
</P>
<P>
   When the Bulls crossed the previous finish line in a wheelchair,
eking by the Pacers, Jordan admitted the swagger was gone. After
losing the opener, there weren't enough knives to accommodate all
the back stabbing. Sensing the end was near, Jordan simply changed
the tone of the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came to practice the next morning laughing and joking,''
Kerr said. ``The only time in three years I've seen him do that
after a loss.''
</P>
<P>
   So while the Jazz started gagging on its own desire, the Bulls
were liberated by their leader. The results are undeniable. And
while the Jazz can climb back into the series with a victory
tonight, the mental edge is clearly in the other corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they take us seriously at all,'' Karl Malone
said. &QL;  &QL; 
Jackson losing credibility &QL;  &QL; 
This stunning transformation has little to do with Bulls Coach Phil
Jackson, whose mystique has taken a major hit in the past few
weeks. On Tuesday, he was again preaching his spin, coddling Dennis
Rodman at the expense of his credibility.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Rodman blew off practice, hung up on his coach, holed
up at Hooters, then bolted for an appearance on WCW's ``Monday
Nitro.'' It is an embarrassment to authority, an insult to the
dignity Jordan has infused into the organization, a slap at the
sanctity of the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, I wouldn't have him,'' Jazz Coach Jerry Sloan
said. ``Everybody knows what he's all about. Winning has never been
that important to him. I'd just as soon lose if I had to be put in
that situation. When that's more important than the game itself,
we've just lost the whole reason for being here.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman didn't explain his need to collect a quick appearance
fee, instead indicting Malone as an ``awkward player,'' an
``average player.'' But he did express a desire to get this thing
over quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``My life just goes to complete hell when I go to Utah,'' Rodman
said. ``That means I have to revert to going to Las Vegas or
somewhere to get my excitement.''
</P>
<P>
   Idiot. &QL;  &QL; 
Sold his soul &QL;  &QL; 
If Jackson had any guts, he would bench Rodman, if not drop him
from the roster altogether. As much as Jackson claims he is working
his Buddhist magic to keep Rodman productive, he has sold his soul
for a championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sleeping in a nest that we helped to build,'' a
disgusted Luc Longley said. ``Our acceptance of him and our
tolerance of him perpetuated the myth.''
</P>
<P>
   As well as exposing Jackson's. Really, now. How many games would
Zen be worth if Big Chief Triangle was coaching the Denver Nuggets?
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the full-court brilliance of Scottie Pippen, there
would be nothing without Jordan. Jackson wouldn't be assured a
place in the Hall of Fame. The owner wouldn't have a palatial
stadium. The general manager wouldn't foolishly place himself next
to Red Auerbach. The Bulls wouldn't overcome the odds and the
oddballs to where they are two wins from another shipment of rings.
</P>
<P>
   No man has ever made more money for others, bloated so many egos
or defied defeat with such vengeance. And it's never been more
apparent than now. &QL;  &QL;

COLLEGE FOOTBALL'S NEW RATING  
 POLLS NOT ONLY CRITERIA FOR GETTING TO TOP BOWL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENT SOMERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It will be the only college football contest played this season
in which the lowest score wins.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the new Bowl Championship Series have approved a
statistical rating system to decide the nation's top two teams, as
well as other schools eligible to participate in the four-bowl
series.
</P>
<P>
   The rating system has four components: the average ranking in
the Associated Press and coaches' poll, the average of three
computer rankings, the strength of schedules and team records.
</P>
<P>
   The system, officials hope, will be particularly helpful in
those years when it's not obvious which two teams are the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear-cut and it's very objective,'' said Roy Kramer,
chairman of the Southeastern Conference and the series coordinator,
said of the rating system.
</P>
<P>
   The Bowl Championship Series, the successor to the alliance, is
designed to guarantee that the nation's two teams are matched in a
bowl every year. The Fiesta Bowl will host the title game this
season.
</P>
<P>
   The national title will still be determined by the postseason
polls, and no one thinks the rating system will diminish the
support of those who want a playoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not as long as there are newspaper columnists and call-in
shows,'' Kramer said.
</P>
<P>
   The rating system not only will select which teams play in the
title game but will determine whether an independent or a team from
a conference without an automatic bid in the series is guaranteed a
slot in one of the four participating bowls: the Fiesta, the
Orange, the Sugar and the Rose. Those teams must finish in the top
six in the final series poll.
</P>
<P>
   The point system will not be used to determine the match-ups in
the series' other non-championship bowl games. Those bowls, each
with a conference tie-in, can determine their best match-ups among
eligible teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Fiesta Bowl, for instance, would still be free to choose to
do what it did last year when it picked Kansas State as an at-large
team largely because the Wildcats bring thousands of fans with
them.
</P>
<P>
   The four bowls will host the series' top game on a rotating
basis. This will be the first season in which the top two ranked
teams are assured of meeting in a bowl.
</P>
<P>
   That was impossible in previous years because the Rose Bowl did
not participate in the agreement, which eliminated Pac-10 and Big
Ten teams from the arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are confident and comfortable with the system,'' said John
Junker, the Fiesta Bowl's, executive director. ``Since our game is
the focus of college football this year, it's awfully nice to have
it resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   If the current agreement had been in place two years ago,
Arizona State would have played Florida State for the title. Last
season, Nebraska and Michigan would have played.
</P>
<P>
   Series officials won't begin releasing its rating until November
because early season ratings are meaningless, Kramer said. The
strength-of-schedule category is only pertinent when teams have
played at least seven or eight games, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The series probably will not eliminate all controversy. There
could be a scenario in which the same two teams are ranked Nos. 1
and 2 in the AP and coaches' polls, yet the rating system
determines the third-ranked team should play for the national
title.
</P>
<P>
   That would have happened in 1990, when Colorado was ranked
first, Georgia Tech second and Texas was third. Colorado and Texas
would have played for the national title because their schedules
were deemed tougher than Georgia Tech's, which ended up sharing the
national title with Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility is that neither team in the championship
plays well and the third-rated team is impressive in its bowl
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Since the final polls still determine the national champion,
it's possible voters could choose to elevate the third-ranked team
to No. 1. &QL;

MARINERS' BUHNER BEGINS CLASS AAA REHAB ASSIGNMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Updates with completion of game.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TACOMA, Wash. _ Jay Buhner rolled into Cheney Stadium Tuesday
with all the trappings of a big-leaguer. The $75,000 black Hummer.
The personalized bats. The Kingdome clubhouse attendant in tow.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Mariner right fielder, on a two-day rehab assignment to
test his surgically repaired left knee, was an easy fit with the
Class AAA Tacoma Rainiers. He sat and joked with his newfound
teammates. He brought food.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, Buhner, in these lesser surroundings, let people
know he wasn't too good for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm nervous, no doubt about it,'' he said before taking the
field against the New Orleans Zephyrs. ``I'm really nervous. I'm
sure it will be that way every at-bat. The thing I'm nervous about
is nobody wants to embarrass himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Buhner did none of that at Cheney Stadium, doubling down the
third-base line on the first pitch sent his way and going 1-for-2
with a walk in his first game in nearly two months. He will play
again for the Rainiers tonight, then fly to Oakland tomorrow
morning and rejoin the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in right and batting fifth, the 33-year-old slugger
went six innings and came away a little sore but satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt fine. No problem,'' said Buhner, who slid into second
on his hit without hesitation. ``I didn't think about it. I saw it
was going to be a close play and I didn't want to get thrown out.
... It just feels good to get back in the swing of things.''
</P>
<P>
   While his fortunes were improving, the Mariners were losing
another in San Francisco. The club's emotional leader, Buhner won't
criticize his teammates, but he is a realist about the damage done.
He fears nasty repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't point fingers,'' he said. ``It takes a team, and
we've been losing as a team. It's come to a head right now. No
doubt there's some frustration in the clubhouse. It's going to be
extremely tough to fight back from where we are. We've dug a hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows what anybody's going to do. That's ownership.
Anything could happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Buhner's appearance Tuesday was well received in Seattle's
sister city to the south. The paid attendance was more than double
the 3,600 average. Gates opened at 4:30 p.m. rather than 6 to allow
fans to watch the celeb take batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   The bald one didn't disappoint, driving six of his 23 pitches
out of the ballpark. Two hit the scoreboard in left-center, one
slamming off the top of it, well over 400 feet away. Another struck
a light standard. Rainier players witnessing these feats could only
giggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you see that?'' center fielder Shane Monahan asked
excitedly after Buhner's most pronounced scoreboard blast. ``That
was the hardest ball I've ever seen hit. It took the ``s'' off
Rainiers.''
</P>
<P>
   After parking his Hummer to begin this adventure, Buhner was
greeted by seven autograph hounds and Kevin Kalal, the Rainiers'
director of baseball operations. His equipment already had beat him
there, compliments of Mariner clubhouse attendant Jam Spears.
Unfortunately, Buhner's batting helmet was left behind, forcing the
attendant to make an unscheduled 70-mile round trip in rush-hour
traffic to retrieve it.
</P>
<P>
   Buhner had a corner locker awaiting him at Cheney, complete with
nameplate and a new number (49). He ended up wearing his own
Mariner jersey (19) after first baseman Randy Jorgenson, who
normally wears that shirt for the Rainiers, volunteered to switch
to something else.
</P>
<P>
   Buhner spent considerable time in the training room before
joining the other Rainiers. They talked fishing, his brother (a
Mariner farmhand in Memphis) and Mariner troubles. He borrowed
chewing tobacco from Raul Ibanez. He talked privately with Rainiers
manager Dave Myers. He was scolded by coach Dave Brundage for
coming out late for stretching exercises.
</P>
<P>
   During BP, Buhner's cuts were so vicious, he knocked the batting
cage supports loose with a foul ball. The contraption had to be
pulled down and put back together, delaying the pregame activity.
</P>
<P>
   Buhner met with reporters for 20 minutes, signed autographs for
fans for another 20. He is noticeably bigger, having added 10
pounds of muscle, increasing his weight to 236. He says his health
is 85 percent and doesn't expect it to be at full capacity the rest
of the summer. He is mulling right knee surgery for the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   He said and did all the right things as he spent his first day
in the minors in nine years. Cheney Stadium even got a compliment.
With grass, not Astroturf, that was automatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place is really nice, nicer than some of the places we've
played in the big leagues,'' Buhner said.

MERCURY, WNBA GO INTERNATIONAL IN TALENT SEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The moment the Mercury's raiding of the international basketball
arc crossed from real to surreal was when the team drafted 6-foot-8
Russian teenager Maria Stepanova. . . .
</P>
<P>
   . . . and was introduced to her agent Boris Leichitski and his
assistant Natasha.
</P>
<P>
   Can Moose and Squirrel be far behind?
</P>
<P>
   For that humor to be understood at Mercury practice, however, it
first requires an explanation of Rocky and Bullwinkle in French,
Japanese and Russian, providing interpreters can first grasp the
concept. Now you begin to see why some WNBA teams dip no deeper
into the international market than English-speaking players out of
U.S. colleges.
</P>
<P>
   With the league assignment of its first player, Australian point
guard Michele Timms, in January 1997, the Mercury plunged into
worldwide talent scouting. The team could begin its second season
Thursday with more than half the roster born outside the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Final cuts are due today, but the 11-woman squad is certain to
include returners Timms and Marlies Askamp of Germany and first-
and second-round draft picks Stepanova and Andrea Kuklova of
Slovakia. On the bubble are returner Mikiko Hagiwara of Japan and
Kristi Harrower and Michelle Griffiths of Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Of the other nine WNBA teams, only the expansion Detroit Shock
is anywhere close to the Mercury in international numbers with
three Australians, a Bulgarian, a Bosnian and a Croatian. Detroit
also put in a claim Monday on forward Natalia Zassoulskaya, whose
20 points and 9 rebounds almost carried Russia past the United
States in the World Championships gold-medal game Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But the Shock's multi-cultural mix pales in comparison to the
Mercury's because the Bulgarian and Croatian speak English, and the
Bosnian can converse with the Croatian and in Italian with one of
the Americans. Zassoulskaya, if she goes to the Shock, would need
an interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   Mercury huddles will be more like the United Nations, with
Boutros Boutros (aka Cheryl) Miller serving as secretary-general as
much as coach-general manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's not about international-American, it's getting the
best players,'' said Seth Sulka, Mercury vice president-operations.
``The only thing you have to be careful about is does that bring a
language barrier, does that bring other cultural barriers and does
it give you the best player as a package? Maybe you get the best
skills, but the package isn't as good. That has to be evaluated
case by case.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the parent NBA, the WNBA thinks globally, not only for
marketing reasons but because there was no domestic women's
basketball between 1984 and '97. ``To have the best basketball
league in the world meant to have the best basketball players from
the world,'' Sulka said.
</P>
<P>
   That approach, combined with the American Basketball League's
early dominance in signing U.S. collegians, attracted a core group
of 15 international players that will almost double this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like having the international players in our league, and
they add a lot to the quality of competition,'' said WNBA President
Val Ackerman. ``We think it has helped make us more attractive to
the rest of the world in terms of fans and international broadcast
alliances.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerusalem Capital Sports, for example, recently agreed to a
two-year contract to televise some 70 NBA and 20 WNBA games per
season. Israel is among 140 countries receiving WNBA games and/or
highlights show. Many of those countries have pro women's leagues
that have financially supported American players for years.
</P>
<P>
   WNBA stars, most of whom top out at $62,000 in salary, can go
overseas and make up to six figures for the other eight months of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact we have so many international players says they're
like the Americans, they see the carrot dangling in front of them
and want to play in a league such as ours,'' said Shock
Coach-General Manager Nancy Lieberman-Cline. ``I know Ticha
Penecheiro (Sacramento's Portguese point guard). Her parents are
going to be able to see her play (on TV). That would be very
appealing to me as a player.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman-Cline played for the Mercury last season and saw the
impact of Timms, not only on the court but in the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   Because Timms knew the 6-foot-5 Askamp through two seasons as
teammates in the German League, Miller went unexplainably small in
the first WNBA draft, then pulled Askamp out of the hat before
training camp. And when Sacramento gave up on Hagiwara and
considered cutting the 1996 Olympian, the Mercury pulled the first
WNBA trade largely on Timms' recommendation of Hagiwara, who three
times scored 20 points or more against the United States during
international games this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Mercury has an Australian assistant coach, Carrie Graf,
and is considering Harrower, who backed up Timms at the recent
World Championships, and Griffiths. It used its first two draft
picks on Stepanova and Kuklova even though the collegiate talent
was ample after the WNBA convincingly beat the ABL in round 2 of
bidding on seniors.
</P>
<P>
   Kuklova speaks what Sulka calls survival English and mostly
communicates through a French interpreter. English is one of
Askamp's three languages, but Russian and Japanese translators are
being hired for Stepanova and Hagiwara.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might be pretty annoying on the bench,'' with Miller's
often colorful speeches flying in four tongues, All-WNBA center
Jennifer Gillom said. ``You're trying to concentrate on the game
and you hear all this blah, blah, blah. Sometimes it can be
distracting.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury has been lucky with its first two interpreters.
</P>
<P>
   Yasuko Matsumoto had brought a youth basketball team from Himeji
City, Japan, to its sister city of Phoenix for a tournament and
still was here on vacation when the trade for Hagiwara was made.
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Guay, who has worked with Kuklova and French free agent
Odile Santaniello during training camp, is a French-Canadian who
came to the Valley to play basketball at Grand Canyon University,
where she met Carolyn Griffiths, now the Mercury trainer.
</P>
<P>
   The new Japanese interpreter is Kyoko Takahashi, an Arizona
State student with no basketball background who has lived in the
United States for 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   When expenses for 15 road games are included, the interpreting
cost becomes a factor, Sulka said, especially when tripled. ``Then
there are the logistics. Are they behind the bench? Do they come
into a huddle? This stuff works fine in practice, but when you're
in the thick of a game, it's not as simple as the coach saying,
`Tell the player to run fast.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gillom, an 11-year overseas veteran, has mixed feelings about
the use of international players. Most overseas leagues limit the
number of foreigners to two per team, something she thinks the WNBA
should consider in order to cultivate young American talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may limit itself because of some of the logistical
issues,'' such as obtaining work visas, Ackerman said. ``As for
now, we welcome them, and most of all they have to be good enough
to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman-Cline agrees. ``It's about competition,'' she said.
``If we as American players can't continue to work on our games and
be better, then I think the best players should play. That's the
way it works in any industry, and the way it should be in the
WNBA.'' &QL;

TRANSPLANTED OMETS TO CHALLENGE MERCURY  
 DEFENDING CHAMPION HOUSTON, LA TO POSE BIGGEST THREATS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Faster than Cheryl Miller can blast her right foot into the
scorer's table and break her big toe, the balance of power in the
WNBA has swung to the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether Miller, coach of the Mercury, can
preserve her other foot from damage in what promises to be an
emotion-charged, parity-driven crusade. At stake is not only the
conference title but a record good enough to earn a precious
playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the four playoff teams in the inaugural season were
from the Eastern Conference, including the Houston Comets, who won
it all and now are in the West. That immediately takes Miller's
Mercury down a notch from defending West champion in preseason
predictions. Some are dropping Phoenix further, below the
fast-finishing Los Angeles Sparks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, when you go strictly on talent, that LA will be tough
to beat,'' Houston Coach Van Chancellor said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury might be, too, once the players who joined the team
this week after the World Championships find their way into a new
motion offense. The cut to a roster of 11 comes today before the
team departs for its opener Thursday in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said she would rather be faced with tough decisions than
having too few talented players to fill the roster. She compared
her predicament to what Danny Ainge went through this season with
the deep Suns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a wonderful situation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The six incoming players (Michele Timms, Michelle Griffiths and
Kristi Harrower of Australia; Mikiko Hagiwara of Japan; Marlies
Askamp of Germany; and Maria Stepanova of Russia) must ``sink or
swim,'' Miller said. ``Right now after throwing them in the water,
I saw a lot of people doing the backstroke and feeling good about
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Once beyond today's roster decisions _ ``Emotions are high right
now,'' Miller said _ the Mercury's goal will be to stand at least
2-1 after the first five days of the season, then use a five-day
break to fully integrate the World Championships players into the
system.
</P>
<P>
   What should emerge by June 21, a home game against Charlotte, is
a bigger and better shooting Mercury than the team that fought off
the Sparks to win the West but was held to a league-low 41 points
in a semifinal playoff loss to the New York Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   With 6-foot-8 first-round draft pick Stepanova and probably 6-3
veteran Pauline Jordan providing reinforcements, frontcourt
starters Jennifer Gillom and Toni Foster will wear better
throughout the 30-game season. And with a microfiber basketball
that is billed as being easier to handle, the 6-5 Askamp could
raise her scoring average into double figures.
</P>
<P>
   Houston (Sheryl Swoopes, who missed much of last season after
giving birth to her son) and Los Angeles (Allison Feaster) both get
an injection of scoring punch at small forward. But Phoenix
acquired its own lower-profile help.
</P>
<P>
   Second- and third-round draft picks Andrea Kuklova of Slovakia
and Brandy Reed flashed their offensive skills during exhibition
wins over Utah. Hagiwara, if she makes the roster, is coming off a
sparkling international tour and might thrive in an offense more
like that of the Japanese national team.
</P>
<P>
   Gillom and Timms, who turn 34 and 33 this month, carried much of
the load in a 16-12 regular season that included an an 8-3 start
and a six-game losing streak. They need help and rest if the
Mercury is to reach a second postseason with bullets left in the
chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, too, was spent by season's end, carrying the weight of a
franchise that led the league in attendance (13,703 average) and
has doubled its season ticket base to 9,000. She tripled her
assistant coaching staff but is no less intense. The broken toe
that will require her to wear a soft cast for four to six weeks
came in the exhibition opener just before she was hit with a
technical foul.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an emotional person,'' she said. ``Would I have done
anything different (to avoid the injury)? Probably not. The only
thing it affects is my clothing attire. Instead of a complete 10,
I'm a 9.''
</P>
<P>
   And no less bold than last season in her public predictions.
``We're bringing this bad boy (WNBA title) home,'' she promised the
crowd after the home exhibition. &QL;

<P>
   &UR; Charlotte Sting &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Coach: Marynell Meadors. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Who's back: Vicky Bullett, 6-foot-3 C; Andrea Congreaves, 6-2
F-C; Sharon Manning, 6-3 C-F; Rhonda Mapp, 6-2 C-F; Andrea Stinson,
5-10 G; Tora Suber, 5-7 G. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Who's new: Sonja Chase, 5-9 G; Pollyana Johns, 6-2 C; Tracy
Reid, 5-11 F; Christy Smith, 5-7 G. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Why they're better: Because the athletic Reid fell to seventh
in the draft, the Sting gets better in transition and at the box
office. Reid was a two-time All-America at North Carolina, joining
an N.C. State-laden (Manning, Mapp, Stinson) roster. Smith steadies
the point guard position. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Where they'll finish: 1st East. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; New York Liberty &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Coach: Nancy Darsch. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Who's back: Kisha Ford, 5-10 G-F; Kym Hampton, 6-2 C; Vicki
Johnson, 5-9 F; Rebecca Lobo, 6-4 F-C; Trena Trice, 6-2 F-C; Teresa
Weatherspoon, 5-8 G; Sue Wicks, 6-3 F; Sophia Witherspoon, 5-10 G. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Who's new: Albena Branzova, 6-3 F; Elisabeth Cebrian, 6-5 C;
Nadine Domond, 5-7 G; Vanessa Nygaard, 6-1 F (injured list); Alicia
Thompson, 6-1 F. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Why they're better: Even making the transition from power to
small forward, Texas Tech All-America Thompson was a steal at ninth
in the draft. The Liberty gets somewhat younger and adds depth. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Where they'll finish: 2nd East. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Cleveland Rockers &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Coach: Linda Hill-MacDonald. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Who's back: Janice Braxton, 6-3 C; Rushia Brown, 6-2 F-C;
Michelle Edwards, 5-9 G; Isabelle Fijalkowski, 6-5 C-F; Adrienne
Johnson, 5-10 G; Merlakia Jones, 5-9 G-F; Eva Nemcova, 6-3 F-G. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Who's new: Tully Bevilaqua, N/A G; Cindy Blodgett, 5-9 G; Tanja
Kostic, 6-1 F; Raegan Scott, 6-3 F; Suzie McConnell Serio, 5-5 G. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Why they're better: Edwards begins the season out because of a
foot injury, but the additions of Blodgett and Serio soften the
loss. Serio, 31, is a two-time Olympian and mother of four;
Blodgett, 22, scored 3,005 points in her college career at Maine.
Brown had 46 points in two exhibitions against champion Houston. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Where they'll finish: 3rd East. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Washington Mystics &QL; 
 &UR; Coach: Jim Lewis. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Who's back: No one, one of two expansion teams. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Who's new: Heidi Burge, 6-5 F; Deborah Carter, 6-0 F; Keri
Chaconas, 5-9 G; Angela Hamblin, 5-10 G-F; Angela Jackson, 6-4 C;
Tammy Jackson, 6-2 F-C; Nikki McCray, 5-11 G; Penny Moore, 6-0 F;
Murriel Page, 6-2 F-C; Alessandra Santos de Oliveira, 6-5 C;
Adrienne Shuler, 5-6 G; Rita Williams, 5-6 G. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Why they're better: McCray brings American Basketball League
Most Valuable Player credentials. Santos de Oliveira took Brazil to
a silver medal at the 1996 Olympics. Burge and Moore are nice
expansion-draft acquisitions. Page was good enough to be drafted
ahead of fellow All-America forwards Tracy Reid and Alicia
Thompson. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Where they'll finish: 4th East. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Detroit Shock &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Coach: Nancy Lieberman-Cline. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Who's back: No one, also an expansion team. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Who's new: Tajama Abraham, 6-2 C; Rhonda Blades, 5-7 G; Gergana
Branzova, 6-4 F; Sandy Brondello, 5-7 G; Cindy Brown, 6-2 F; Korie
Hlede, 5-9 G; Razija Mujanovic, 6-8 C; Carla Porter, 6-1 F; Rachel
Sporn, 6-1 F; Tara Williams, 5-11 F; Lynette Woodard, 6-0 G;
Natalia Zassoulskaya, N/A F (if approved by league). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Why they're better: Next to the Mercury, the Shock is the most
international of WNBA teams, with three Australians (Brondello,
Porter, Sporn), a Bosnian (Mujanovic), Bulgarian (Branzova) and
perhaps Russian World Championships silver medalist. Woodard, 38,
is a playing contemporary of Lieberman-Cline's, Blades and Brown
are experienced pros. Hlede was the second of six point guards
taken in the first 17 picks of the draft. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Where they'll finish: 5th East. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Houston Comets &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Coach: Van Chancellor. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Who's back: Janeth Arcain, 5-11 F; Cynthia Cooper, 5-10 G;
Wanda Guyton, 6-1 C; Kim Perrot, 5-5 G; Sheryl Swoopes, 6-0 F; Tina
Thompson, 6-2 F. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Who's new: Karen Booker, 6-1 C; Monica Lamb-Lattin, 6-5 C;
Nyree Roberts, 6-3 C; Polina Tzekova, 6-4 C; Amaya Valdemoro, 6-1
F. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Why they're better: The defending league champions, shifting
from the Eastern Conference to the West, are bigger, more physical
and have an in-shape Swoopes for a full season. Tzekova is
unavailable for the foreseeable future because of her mother's
heart problems. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Where they'll finish: 1st West. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Phoenix Mercury &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Coach: Cheryl Miller. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Who's back: Marlies Askamp, 6-5 C-F; Toni Foster, 6-1 F;
Jennifer Gillom, 6-3 C; Mikiko Hagiwara, 5-9 G; Bridget Pettis, 5-9
G; Michele Timms, 5-7 G; Umeki Webb, 5-10 G-F. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Who's new: Dena Evans, 5-5 G; Michelle Griffiths, 6-1 F; Kristi
Harrower, 5-4 G; Andrea Kuklova, 6-0 G-F; Brandy Reed, 6-1 F; Maria
Stepanova, 6-8 C. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Why they're better: The defending West champions got bigger
without sacrificing their trademark mobility. Perimeter shooting
should be more consistent with Reed and Kuklova taking some of the
load off Pettis. As Stepanova develops, Gillom might shift to power
forward. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Where they'll finish: 2nd West. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Los Angeles Sparks &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Coach: Julie Rousseau. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Who's back: Katrina Colleton, 5-10 F-G; Tamecka Dixon, 5-9 G;
Lisa Leslie, 6-5 C-F; Mwadi Mabika, 5-11 G-F; Penny Toler, 5-8 G;
Jamila Wideman, 5-6 G; Haixia Zheng, 6-8 C. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Who's new: Erin Alexander, 5-7 G; Octavia Blue, 6-1 F; Allison
Feaster, 5-11 G-F; Pam McGee, 6-3 C. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Why they're better: Feaster, the national collegiate scoring
leader, makes the Sparks as deadly at small forward as at the other
four starting positions. LA won't have to dig out of a 5-10 hole
like last season. Wideman (back) could be out for the season. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Where they'll finish: 3rd West. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Sacramento Monarchs &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Coach: Heidi VanDerveer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Who's back: Ruthie Bolton-Holifield, 5-9 G; Latasha Byears,
5-11 G; Bridgette Gordon, 6-0 F. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Who's new: Adia Barnes, 5-10 F; Quacy Barnes, 6-4 C; Linda
Burgess, 6-1 F; Lady Hardmon, 5-10 G; Tiffani Johnson, 6-4 C; Ticha
Penicheiro, 5-11 G; Franthea Price, 5-9 G; Tangela Smith, 6-4 F-C. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Why they're better: Penicheiro added to Bolton-Holifield makes
for the league's best guard combination. The organization by
default has to be more stable than last season, with its coaching
change and player revolt. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Where they'll finish: 4th West. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Utah Starzz &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Coach: Denise Taylor. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Who's back: Elena Baranova, 6-5 F; Dena Head, 5-10 G; Greta
Koss, 6-1 F; Wendy Palmer, 6-2 F; Tammi Reiss, 5-6 G; Kim Williams,
5-6 G. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Who's new: Tricia Bader, 5-4 G; Malgorzata Dydek, 7-2 C; Fran
Harris, 6-0 G; LaTonya Johnson, 6-0 F; Olympia Scott, 6-2 F-C;
Chantel Tremitiere, 5-6 G. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Why they're better: ``Large Marge'' will do her job as the
Mercury saw in a pair of exhibition games, but the black hole at
guard remains. Tremitiere, obtained in a trade from Sacramento, led
the league in minutes last year but hasn't found favor at point,
leaving the unproductive Head. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Where they'll finish: 5th West. &QL;

SON MAY MAKE REUSS A DIA MONDBACKS FAN  
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Former major league pitcher Jerry Reuss is a broadcaster for the
Anaheim Angels. He's also a very proud dad.
</P>
<P>
   Reuss' son was drafted in the 26th round by the Diamondbacks
last week. First baseman-outfielder Jason Reuss is senior at Canyon
High School in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited about it,'' said Jerry Reuss, who had a 220-191
record that spanned 22 seasons. ``And I know he is thrilled beyond
belief.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason recently underwent knee surgery and won't play this
summer, which probably scared a few teams, ``but the rehab is going
great,'' Reuss said.
</P>
<P>
   Reuss said his son will meet with the Diamondbacks on Friday to
discuss a contract. Looking around Bank One Ballpark before Tuesday
night's game against Anaheim, Reuss said, ``If he were down here
looking at this ballpark, he would crawl to that pen and paper.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Field gets repairs &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks Manager Buck Showalter commented before the game
how good the field looked. A lot of work was done during the club's
11-game trip, the most noticeable being large patches of sod that
replaced worn areas in the outfield, as well as in foul territory. &QL; 
 &QL; 
On the mend &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Jorge Fabregas, on the disabled list since May 31
because of a severely sprained right ankle, finished his
rehabilitation stint in Tucson and is scheduled to begin working
out with the Diamondbacks today. Fabregas is eligible to come off
the DL in time for Tuesday's game in Cincinnati but may not rejoin
the roster then. &QL; 
 &QL; 
No skipping &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bob Wolcott, who pitched eight scoreless innings in his
Diamondbacks debut Friday night in Oakland, will start Thursday
night. Because of Monday's off day, Showalter contemplated skipping
Wolcott and keeping the other four starters on four days of rest. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Mr. Irrelevant &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks have another first to record: baseball's
initial Mr. Irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas Gruner was the last pick _ No. 1,445 in the 50th round by
the Diamondbacks _ and the Irrelevant Club thinks that's pretty
special. So for the first time in the club's 23-year history, a
baseball nobody will join a football nobody as Mr. Irrelevant . . .
only Gruner is even more irrelevant because the last pick in the
football draft gets a bunch of neat stuff, and about all Gruner
gets is a free meal.
</P>
<P>
   Gruner, 18, is a high school catcher from Long Beach, Calif. His
football counterpart is tight end Cam Quayle of Weber State, who
was picked by Baltimore in the sixth round as the 241st selection. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Suspension begins &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim Manager Terry Collins began serving his eight-game
suspension Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Collins left his coaches, Joe Maddon, Larry Bowa and Marcel
Lachemann, to split the managing duties.
</P>
<P>
   Collins was suspended after the Angels and Kansas City had two
bench-clearing brawls during a game last week. &QL;

D-BACKS SLAMMED  
 FIELDER'S BLAST GIVES ANGELS 9TH WIN IN ROW

<TEXT>
<P>
   After 11 games on the road, the Diamondbacks returned home
Tuesday night and gave Anaheim ace Chuck Finley his roughest
treatment in nearly a year. They turned a club-record four double
plays and were turned on by Yamil Benitez's first career grand
slam.
</P>
<P>
   But it takes more than that to beat these ascending Angels.
Cecil Fielder hit his own grand slam and drove in six runs, and
Anaheim won its ninth straight, 10-8, before 43,074 at Bank One
Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   ``We squandered eight runs against a good club and a good
pitcher,'' Diamondbacks Manager Buck Showalter said. ``That's
tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Showalter raved about the Angels, calling them
``one of the more well-rounded clubs,'' and about Anaheim first
baseman Darin Erstad in particular.
</P>
<P>
   ``Erstad is one of my favorite players in the American League,''
Showalter said. ``I love watching him play.''
</P>
<P>
   Love hurts. Erstad went 5 for 5, scored three runs and drove in
the go-ahead run.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we didn't walk him (in the ninth), he might have had six
hits,'' Showalter said. ``I've always liked him. It's not just his
skill or his hitting ability, but how he goes about his business.''
</P>
<P>
   Showalter had to stick around and watch, but not Angels Manager
Terry Collins, who began serving an eight-game suspension as a
result of last week's brawl with Kansas City. Collins wasn't far
away, however, watching the game on television at a downtown hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Live or on TV, Collins didn't like what the Diamondbacks did
early _ take the lead on Tony Batista's two-run home run off Finley
in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   It was Batista's second homer of the season, his first since
April 24. And the fun was just beginning. In the third inning with
runners on first and second, rookie first baseman Travis Lee
committed his first error of the season, a hard shot off his glove
that sailed directly to second baseman Batista. Pitcher Willie
Blair seemed to cover first in time for a play, but Batista didn't
throw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see he was there,'' Batista said. ``I was a little
confused.''
</P>
<P>
   The bases were loaded for Fielder, who leaned his ample girth
into Blair's first pitch and sent it deep into the picnic area in
center field for his 11th career grand slam and a 4-2 Angels lead.
</P>
<P>
   That lasted as long as it took for Finley to walk Matt Williams,
Lee and Jay Bell in succession with one out in the bottom of the
third, and then give up Benitez's slam, a shot to right-center. The
Diamondbacks led, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   It was just the sixth time in major league history teams hit a
grand slam in the same inning.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Collins admitted he would be tense and said his
hotel room ``is going to have a chance to have a little damage in
it'' if the Angels ticked him off. He was presumably joking, but it
was easy to envision chairs and ice buckets flying at this point.
</P>
<P>
   Benitez was coming off a two-hit, three-RBI game against Oakland
on Sunday that included a home run. Finley came in with a 6-2
record and a 2.22 ERA. He had not allowed more than one run in each
of his last four starts, and these were the most runs scored
against the lefthander since June 27, 1997, a span of 24 outings.
</P>
<P>
   And it didn't matter. The Angels scored a run in the fifth on
Garrett Anderson's single. In the sixth, Blair walked Norberto
Martin and came out for Clint Sodowsky. That didn't help. Sodowsky
walked Gary DiSarcina, and pinch hitter Orlando Palmiero hit a shot
that bounced off Sodowsky's right arm like a goalie making a save.
</P>
<P>
   But Sodowsky had trouble finding the ball in front of him. And
when he did, he threw it past Lee at first. Martin scored on the
error, and the score was tied at 6.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad put the Angels ahead with an RBI single, and another run
scored to make it 8-6 when Dave Hollins hit into a double play.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's bases-loaded single in the sixth made it 8-7. Bell also
had the bases full, but he flied out to deep right to end the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Fielder drove in two more runs in the eighth with a bases-loaded
single off newly-acquired Willie Banks. &QL;

`TRUE PROFESSIONAL' HAS BIG NIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It hasn't been easy being Yamil Benitez this season.
</P>
<P>
   He came to the Diamondbacks filled with anticipation, believing
the change in scenery from Kansas City would be the right tonic to
kick-start his big-league career.
</P>
<P>
   Two months into the 1998 season it would have been
understandable if Benitez had wanted to jump ship. Tuesday night's
game marked the first time Benitez had started consecutive games
since April 23-24.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he was pulled during the top of the sixth inning as
part of a double-switch, Benitez drew more attention toward his
cause by slamming the first grand slam of his career and adding a
double and line-drive out to third base during his three at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   But with right-hander Ken Hill scheduled to start for Anaheim
tonight, it's probable that Benitez will find himself back on the
wooden bench inside the Diamondbacks dugout, a spot Benitez has
become very familiar with this season.
</P>
<P>
   But the impeccably dressed and coifed Benitez, 26, will never
say a negative word about his situation, preferring to always think
optimistically and positively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing good can come from griping about your situation,''
Benitez said recently. ``Plus, that's not the way I am. I always
think and hope for the best in any situation. That's not to say I'm
not frustrated at times. But I don't make the decisions. All I can
do is prepare myself to play every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Benitez, possibly the quietest player on the roster, is in a
precarious situation. When he was lifted during Tuesday night's
loss to Anaheim, it illustrated his role for the Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   After starting eight of the first 14 games of the season,
Benitez has been limited to a role where he is used sparingly. All
the while, he has drawn praise from Manager Buck Showalter for
showing amazing patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't been an easy role for Yamil,'' Showalter said last
week. ``But he's handled it as well as anyone could possibly ask.
He's been a true professional.''
</P>
<P>
   In this day of players pouting if they are not used, Benitez is
a breath of fresh air. You will never hear Benitez moan like Boston
pitcher John Wasdin, who with an ERA over 5.00 at the time,
complained last week when the Red Sox sent him to Triple A
Pawtucket.
</P>
<P>
   Benitez, who is out of options and cannot be sent to the minors
without being exposed to the other 29 clubs, just wants a chance to
show what he can do.
</P>
<P>
   In his past two games he has shown plenty. During Sunday's
lopsided 12-4 victory over Oakland, Benitez slammed a home run to
lead off the third inning, pumping the Diamondbacks lead to 3-0 at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   He added a single and was later hit in the ribs with a fastball
from Athletics reliever Mike Fetters, a pitch that began the bad
blood that spilled between the two clubs later in the game.
</P>
<P>
   When Benitez was hit, several Diamondbacks on the bench rose to
the top steps of the dugout at the Oakland Coliseum, wanting to
protect their seldom-used outfielder.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should have seen how many players wanted something to be
done right there and then,'' Showalter said. ``This is a guy
everyone on this team likes.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Benitez, taken in the first round of the expansion draft
from the Royals' organization, indeed breaks through or not is
unknown. His chances of receiving serious playing time with the
Diamondbacks are not great right now.
</P>
<P>
   With David Dellucci looking every bit the everyday player in
left field and Karim Garcia getting a long look in right field,
Benitez apparently will remain the odd man out.
</P>
<P>
   But you'll never hear him say a peep about his lack of playing
time. Benitez, who has the striking looks of a Latin matinee idol,
believes in his heart he will one day be an everyday major league
player.
</P>
<P>
   It's just one of the intriguing and interesting sidelight to
watch during a baseball season. &QL;

SEN. FEINSTEIN WORKS TO SOLVE ENCRYPTION STANDOFF 
</HEADLINE>
   By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an effort to resolve bitter differences over
data encryption, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., brokered a
meeting Tuesday between several prominent high-tech executives and
top law enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   The closed-door discussion brought together for the first time
FBI Director Louis Freeh, Attorney General Janet Reno and such
high-tech leaders as Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates to review the
data-scrambling technology, which keeps computer communications
private.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh wants the FBI to be able to access encryption codes for
wire-tapping and other criminal investigations. The computer
industry contends that such efforts threaten privacy and free
speech.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration also wants to maintain controls over
exports of U.S. encryption technology. The industry argues that the
controls put U.S. companies at a competitive disadvantage, hamper
innovation and ultimately undermine their lead in technology.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein, a strong law-enforcement supporter, is the top
Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee's panel on technology,
terrorism and government information. Feinstein said in a statement
that she has ``developed a strong interest'' in encryption, and
that when she learned that Freeh ``had not had the opportunity to
talk directly with the CEOs of American high-tech companies
regarding his concerns,'' she offered to organize a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always believed that when there are areas of
disagreement, it is helpful to bring the principals together to
talk face to face,'' said Feinstein, for ``frank and informal
discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting allied Gates with some computer executives who have
frequently been his harshest critics _ Jim Barksdale, president of
Netscape; Scott McNealy, chief executive officer of Sun
Microsystems; and Eric Schmidt, chief executive officer of Novell _
as well as Steve Case, chief executive officer of America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Other law enforcement officials included Thomas Constantine,
head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Bobby Moody, president
of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, and William
Murphy, president of the National District Attorneys Association.
All declined to divulge details about the meeting.

ALARM OVER THREATENED MARINE LIFE IN OCEAN REFUGES 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX BARNUM  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    SAN FRANCISCO _ It was billed as the oceanic equivalent of the
National Park system.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Twenty-six years ago, Congress authorized the creation of marine
sanctuaries to protect underwater regions and marine life that are
as breathtaking as anything the Grand Canyon, Yellowstone or
Yosemite have to offer.
</P>
<P>
   But as President Clinton and policy makers gather this week in
Monterey to discuss the fate of the oceans, environmentalists and
marine scientists say that the areas are sanctuaries in name only
and that protections for marine life must be greatly strengthened.
</P>
<P>
   Oil drilling and mining are banned in the sanctuaries, but
fishing is prohibited in only 36 square miles of the system's
18,000 square miles of open water. To environmentalists, that is
the equivalent of allowing hunting in 99 percent of national parks.
</P>
<P>
   High on advocates' agenda when the conference in Monterey,
Calif., opens Wednesday is a proposal to set aside 20 percent of
the sanctuary system as true refuges, where fish and other marine
creatures would be safe from fishing nets and lines.
</P>
<P>
   With a third of America's harvested species threatened by
overfishing, there is a growing consensus among environmentalists
and marine scientists that creating these refuges is critical to
restoring depleted fish populations and protecting ocean habitat.
</P>
<P>
   A group of 1,600 scientists has signed a ``call to action,''
urging that fully 20 percent of the world's oceans be protected in
refuges by the year 2020. Currently, less than a quarter of 1
percent of the ocean has such protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marine reserves are absolutely essential,'' said Jane
Lubchenco, a marine ecologist at Oregon State University and a
former president of the American Association for the Advancement of
Science. ``They are simply our best hedge against what could happen
with our fisheries.''
</P>
<P>
   Created by Congress in 1972 _ 100 years after the creation of
the National Park system _ the sanctuary system is administered by
the Commerce Department. Its largest unit is the Monterey Bay
sanctuary, an area the size of Connecticut, which was added to the
system in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the refuge concept concede that research on marine
reserves is scant, largely because they have not been around very
long. What scientific studies there are, however, show that
``no-take'' refuges provide major benefits for fish populations.
</P>
<P>
   In a study conducted in Puget Sound in Washington comparing a
marine reserve with a fished area adjacent to it, researchers found
that rockfish were much more plentiful and that egg production was
much higher inside the reserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``The information that does exist says unequivocally that
(refuges) are very powerful for increasing populations,'' said
Lubchenco. ``What is uncertain is how much of that is exported to
neighboring areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists also argue that marine reserves would serve as an
ideal place in which scientists can study marine ecosystems that
are relatively free of the effects of the presence of humans.
</P>
<P>
   But the ambitious proposal is certain to create new friction
with fishing groups. Indeed, even some groups that have been
traditionally allied with environmentalists question whether the
science justifies the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't just go out and dedicate 20 percent'' of an area as
a reserve, said Zeke Grader, executive director of the Pacific
Coast Federation of Fishermen's Associations. ``We won't know until
we have some real scientists look at this, instead of advocates.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing that environmentalists and fishing groups agree on is
that California's system of marine reserves, while one of the
largest in the nation, serves as a poor model.
</P>
<P>
   In California, there are more than 104 so-called marine
protected areas. But the system is a confusing, fragmented
patchwork of overlapping jurisdictions, each with a different set
of regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Also, all types of marine harvest are prohibited in only four of
the areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that we have an ad hoc system,'' said Wendy
Pulling, an attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council who
has been working to reform the system. ``Some of these areas, while
they're called `protected,' aren't protected at all.''
</P>
<P>
   To make sense of this hodgepodge, state Assemblyman Kevin
Shelley, D-San Francisco, has introduced a bill in the state
Legislature, called the Sea Life Conservation Act, that would
consolidate the current fragmented system.
</P>
<P>
   It also would authorize the Fish and Game Department to create a
broader network of sea life reserves, including areas where the
taking of any marine species would be prohibited. The bill has
passed in the California Assembly and awaits action in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an interconnected ecosystem, and to have all these
independent reserves makes no sense to me,'' Shelley said. ``It's
all one ocean out there.''

FDA POSTS WEB SITE ON VIAGRA DEATHS; CAUSE UNCLEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   By SABIN RUSSELL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bowing to a public fascination with all things Viagra, the Food
and Drug Administration has begun posting on the Internet regular
updates of deaths among patients who had taken the popular
anti-impotence pill.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen deaths have now been reported to the FDA among men who
have taken the drug since it hit the market in April. The first six
deaths were reported May 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll monitor these reports to see if they lead us to any
trends,'' said FDA spokeswoman Lorrie McHugh.
</P>
<P>
   Of the sixteen deaths, seven occurred among men who were having
sex or shortly after they had sex _ raising some concern that
patients too ill for the exertion of sexual activity were being
tempted to try it by the promise of the drug.
</P>
<P>
   But now, as was the case in May, it is uncertain whether the
medication played any role in the deaths of the men who took it.
Scientifically, the anecdotes are almost meaningless. Three of the
cases were merely accounts of deaths reported in the media.
</P>
<P>
   Both the FDA and Viagra's maker, Pfizer Inc., continue to voice
their confidence in the pill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new drug. We're not going to pretend we're not going to
see things we didn't find in the trials. But in terms of overall
safety, we are reassured,'' said Pfizer spokesman Andrew McCormick.
</P>
<P>
   Since its approval as the first effective pill to treat
impotence, more than 1.7 million prescriptions for Viagra have been
filled, making Viagra the most popular new drug ever sold.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer estimates that 85 percent of Viagra users are over age
50, many of them with physical conditions such as high blood
pressure or diabetes that can cause impotence.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 16 reported deaths, 10 were in men older than 60. The
youngest man to die was a 48-year-old with a history of diabetes
who had chest pains during sex and was given nitroglycerin by
ambulance crews. Nitroglycerin, like Viagra, dilates blood vessels,
and in combination can lead to a dangerous drop in blood pressure.
Nitrate drugs are the one class of medications that Viagra's label
warns against mixing.
</P>
<P>
   Nitroglycerin is routinely administered to patients suspected of
having a heart attack, and anecdotal accounts like this one led
Pfizer to warn emergency room personnel and paramedics to ask
victims if they have taken Viagra.

 Software Helps Tap Lost Riches in a Company's Patents   By Tom Abate  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
In the high-tech economy, managing a portfolio of patents can
unlock hidden revenues.
<TEXT>
<P>
   SmartPatents, a startup in Mountain View, is automating this
process with a new software that shows firms how to extract more
wealth from their intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
   The software can suggest new ways to license a patent or tell a
company if the patent is obsolete and not worth the fees to keep
it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ``There's a huge patent game being played out there at the
highest levels of major corporations,'' said Kevin Rivette, chief
executive of SmartPatents. ``IBM makes a billion dollars a year
licensing patents.''
</P>
<P>
   A company that gets an intellectual lock on a hot technology can
keep competitors out of a market, or charge them to enter it
</P>
<P>
   But analyzing patents has always been a black art. Companies had
to rely on a legal priesthood for advice on when to sue their
competitors, or back out of a market lest they get sued themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Rivette and co-founder Irving Rappaport, both noted patent
attorneys, have spent the past five years creating software with
the legal smarts of a good patent attorney. They won't say how many
firms have plunked down $50,000 or more for their computer-aided
advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our clients consider our software a competitive advantage,''
said SmartPatents President Dan'l Lewin, a former Apple executive
and friend of Steve Jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Malley, intellectual property chief for Lucent
Technologies, said he has spent the Last two years using the
program to manage that intellectual gold mine known as Bell Labs.
</P>
<P>
   ``SmartPatents is to patent management what Visicalc was to
accounting many years ago,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; No free telephony? &LR;  Back in private practice after a
three-year stint at the Federal Communications Commission, attorney
Rachelle Chong is sounding the alarm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FCC is considering regulating Internet telephony,'' Chong
said. ``This is the next big clash between the government and the
computer industry.''
</P>
<P>
   You remember Internet telephony? Plug your computer into the
Internet, talk into the microphone and dial anywhere in the world,
for free.
</P>
<P>
   But Chong said the five-member commission is starting to wonder
whether Internet service providers who offer some forms of
telephony should be considered long-distance companies. If so, they
might be subjected to the same rules and charges, which can add 5
cents a minute to every ``free'' call.
</P>
<P>
   Chong, who hopes to head off any regulation, says four of the
five current commissioners are new and unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the newcomers is FCC Chairman William Kennard, a former
FCC staff attorney familiar with the 1996 Telecommunications Reform
Act.
</P>
<P>
   He is joined by Michael Powell, an antitrust lawyer and son of
Army General Colin Powell; Gloria Tristani, a former state PUC
commissioner from New Mexico; and Harold Furchtgott-Roth, former
aide to Representative Thomas Bliley, R-Va., chairman of the House
Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the panel is veteran commissioner Susan Ness, an
attorney and banker who is an FOH _ Friend of Hillary Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Gentrification? &LR;  Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park has been the
haunt of venture capitalists.
</P>
<P>
   Now, investment bankers are trading in San Francisco for what is
fast becoming the financial nerve center of Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes sense for us to be down here to be next to the VCs,''
said Rex Golding, who runs Morgan Stanley's technology group.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Koenig, who heads Goldman Sachs' technology practice is
also moving 80 bankers into a new office on Sand Hill. Frank
Quattrone's DMG Technology Group is already in Menlo Park, and
Merrill Lynch has an investment banking branch in Palo Alto.
</P>
<P>
   Other firms are said to be mulling similar moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be an investment banking ghetto by the time we're
finished,'' Golding joked.

 (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)   NBC Buys Stake In Cnet to Get Online On-Ramp  
   
 By Jamie Beckett  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
In a deal marrying the top broadcast network with one of the
least-known Web directories, NBC said yesterday that it is buying a
stake in Cnet and gradually will take over its Snap! navigation
site.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The TV network will invest $26 million to buy 4.9 percent of San
Francisco-based Cnet, best known for its Web sites offering
technology news. That's just what the network pays for two episodes
of ``ER,'' the top-rated show on television.
</P>
<P>
   NBC is purchasing the 19 percent stake in Cnet's fledgling Snap!
Internet directory and navigation service for an undisclosed sum,
with an option to own 60 percent of Snap! for $38 million.
</P>
<P>
   NBC executives, who immediately will start running Snap! jointly
with Cnet, said they hope to turn the site into a major Internet
gateway, or portal, similar to Yahoo, America Online or Excite.
Typically, Net users begin their Internet experiences on these
sites, which often provide news, personalized content and e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``The portal space is where the eyeballs and the money are on
the Internet,'' said Marty Yudkovitz, president of NBC Interactive
Media. ``It is the pivotal place to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Cnet's shares jumped $12.13 to close at $45.13 on Nasdaq
yesterday _ a 36.7 percent rise, making it the second-biggest
gainer of all U.S. stocks. The stocks of other Internet gateway
companies also were up yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Cnet launched Snap! in September and has invested some $25
million in the money-losing service, said Halsey Minor, chairman
and chief executive of Cnet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all about making Snap! successful,'' Minor said. ``As
a more mature media company, NBC has a tremendous amount of
expertise, as well as tremendous relationships with advertisers
exceeding those of anyone on the Internet today.''
</P>
<P>
   After the deal closes, NBC will cover Snap! expenses, Minor
said, although he will be its chief executive. Yudkovitz and three
other NBC executives will join the Snap! board to make a majority.
</P>
<P>
   NBC said it intends to promote Snap! on its television network
and on several of its other Internet properties. Snap! likely will
rely on NBC for some of its content, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   That content will give Snap! an edge _ the same way Excite's
recent agreement to run Disney content provides an advantage, said
David Simons, managing director of Digital Video Investments in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's content that moves the masses,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   NBC officials said they were keen on getting further into the
Internet business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no secret that broadcast television is not a growth
business. This investment is fundamental to NBC's growth,''
Yudkovitz said.
</P>
<P>
   The television network said it will bring in ``select NBC
employees'' to work at Snap! in the future, but it has no definite
plans. All 170 full-time workers and part-time contractors at Snap!
will keep their jobs, Yudkovitz said.
</P>
<P>
   NBC did not indicate when it will exercise its option to raise
its stake in Snap!
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first media company that has really gone into
building a portal,'' said Regina Joseph, senior analyst at Jupiter
Communications in New York. ``I think we'll see a lot of other
media companies follow suit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cnet investment is only the latest of NBC's Internet
ventures. In addition to MSNBC, its 24-hour cable TV and online
news network operated jointly with Microsoft, the network has an
entertainment site, an on-demand Internet video service and a
localized Internet community guide service.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's deal with Cnet is the most recent move by a media titan to
try to cash in on the Bay Area's technology boom.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Forbes Inc. said it will establish a West Coast base
in Burlingame. New York publishing giant Ziff-Davis launched ZDTV,
a cable TV channel for high-tech news, in San Francisco in May.
Knight Ridder said in April that it will transfer its corporate
headquarters to Silicon Valley to make a bigger splash for its Web
operations.

 Antivirus Firm's British Expansion   By Julia Angwin  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Fast-growing Network Associates of Santa Clara bought a foothold in
the European antivirus software market yesterday with its $640
million purchase of Dr. Solomon's Group PLC of Britain.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Network Associates makes the leading antivirus software in the
United States _ McAfee VirusScan _ but is always looking for ways
to increase its lead over No. 2 antivirus software-maker Symantec
Corp. of Cupertino.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have three goals: To extend our leadership position in
antivirus, to make a geography play in Europe and to add 150 sales
people in Europe,'' said Bill Larson, chief executive of Network
Associates.
</P>
<P>
   This is Network Associates' 12th acquisition since Larson took
over as CEO of what was then-known as McAfee Associates in 1993. He
has used the buying spree to turn the antivirus firm into a
one-stop shop for corporate security and network management.
</P>
<P>
   After the acquisition is completed, Network Associates plans to
give corporate customers Dr. Solomon's Anti-Virus Toolkit along
with McAfee VirusScan, which may sometimes uncover different
viruses. By next year, Larson said, the firm will create a version
of the software for corporate customers that includes the best of
both products.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  But the company will continue to sell the two separate
products in stores. Larson said McAfee VirusScan will cost about 29
pounds compared to Dr. Solomon's 69 pounds in England. But in the
United States where Dr. Solomon's is not well-known, he said the
price ratio will be reversed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will let us hit multiple price points,'' Larson said.
``It's kind of a classic Procter &AMP; Gamble play.''
</P>
<P>
   Larson said he also hopes to use the Dr. Solomon's 150-person
sales force to sell other Network Associates products to the 10
million to 15 million Dr. Solomon's customers &UR;  &LR; who are primarily in
England and Northern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives Network Associates an opportunity to expand its
presence quite nicely,'' said Chris Shilakes, an analyst at Merrill
Lynch in San Francisco. ``It certainly makes sense to us.''
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts worry that Network Associates, the nation's
10th largest software firm, may be stretching itself too thin with
its long string of acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to buy up a lot of technologies; it's another
thing to integrate and sell them,'' said Jim Balderston, analyst at
Zona Research in Redwood City. ``That is easier said than done.''
</P>
<P>
   And Symantec officials said the move was simply a reaction to
Symantec's recent co-marketing agreement with giant computer-maker
IBM.
</P>
<P>
   ``The balance of power was shifting because we had IBM behind
us, so now they're reacting so they don't lose too much ground,''
said Enrique Salem, vice president of the Cupertino-based firm.
</P>
<P>
   But Wall Street applauded the move, boosting Network Associates
shares up $1.88 _ by 4 percent _ to $43.88 and boosting Dr.
Solomon's stock up $3.38 _ by 11 percent _ to $35.50.

 Investors Cool to Bank Deal   By Peter Sinton  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Investors apparently are less than thrilled with the planned merger
of Wells Fargo and Minneapolis-based Norwest Corp.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Norwest stock fell 88 cents yesterday to close at $35.94 on more
than three times average daily volume. Taken together with the
$2.88 decline on Monday, the day the merger was announced, Norwest
shares have fallen 9.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Wells Fargo shares slumped $12.75 yesterday to $353
after gaining just $2.50 on Monday and are selling well below the
bank's record high of $389.94 reached May 1.
</P>
<P>
   By combining forces to become the nation's seventh-largest bank,
the new Wells Fargo bank, which will be based in San Francisco,
expects to expand services while cutting 2,300 jobs out of 90,000
and reduce costs by $650 million annually within three years.
</P>
<P>
   Bank analysts don't dispute the logic of the merger or the
financial estimates. ``But investors were hoping if Wells sold out,
there might be a bidding contest and they'd get a much higher
price,'' said Michael Ancell, an analyst with Edward Jones in St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``A marriage of equals with Norwest wasn't on anyone's radar
screens. They were expecting a merger with First Union, Banc One
and of course, U.S. Bancorp.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Grundhofer, CEO of U.S. Bancorp and located just a block
away from Norwest in Minneapolis, ``was putting the full court
press on Wells,'' said Ancell.
</P>
<P>
   Because of reported clashes with the former Wells vice chairman,
though, Wells CEO Paul Hazen apparently was more receptive to
Norwest's offer.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Grundhofer reportedly offered a price that was
slightly below Norwest's bid, which was worth nearly $397 per share
(based on Norwest's higher stock price last Friday).
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo spokeswoman Kim Kellogg would not comment other than
to say Wells Fargo talked to several interested parties and the
deal with Norwest was clearly the best.
</P>
<P>
   Wells' shares got off to a rocky start yesterday after Brown
Brothers Harriman &AMP; Co. analyst Raphael Soifer downgraded the
company to ``neutral.''
</P>
<P>
   Soifer said that Wells stock already was selling at a premium
because of an expected acquisition and that ``there was no point
keeping a `trading buy' recommendation'' after the Norwest deal was
announced.
</P>
<P>
   Soifer said that he was encouraged by Wells Fargo's new
estimates that it will earn the equivalent of $22.30 per share by
next year. That is about 10 percent more than he and many other
analysts were anticipating.
</P>
<P>
   But he noted that in the previous merger of Wells and First
Interstate it took a year and a half to really see how it worked
out and it could take equally that long to see the results of this
merger.
</P>
<P>
   Norwest's stock apparently skidded on similar concerns and
worries that it has abandoned its successful formula of expanding
through small acquisitions and internal growth. In the past five
years, Norwest has more than doubled net income from $613 million
to $1.35 billion through this approach.
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo and Norwest stocks are not the only ones to decline
following their merger announcement. BankAmerica's stock jumped
$4.63 to $91.13 on the day its deal with NationsBank was reported,
but it closed yesterday at $85.63, or 87 cents below its pre-merger
price two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, NationsBank's shares are trading at $77.44, down
$3.31 from its post-merger announcement peak but $1 higher than
before the deal was announced.

<TEXT>
<P>
   1. GILLIAN ANDERSON, CONSPIRACY THEORISTS' PIN-UP GIRL As
sceptical Agent Scully on ``The X-Files,'' Gillian Anderson is the
love goddess of alien buffs, conspiracy theorists and
paranormalists worldwide. ``The X-Files'' movie will test the range
of her appeal. Anderson talks about the new movie, ``X-Files''
mania, the plot details of the film and why she is diligently
working to separate herself from the series which brought her fame
and fortune. By Ian Spelling. 1,400 words + photo.
</P>
<P>

   2. JENNIFER LOVE HEWITT, PARTY OF ONE In the romantic comedy
``Can't Hardly Wait,'' Jennifer Love Hewitt plays a high-school
prom queen facing graduation. She is herself a recent high-school
graduate. This 19-year-old is already a star. Hewitt tells Cindy
Pearlman about the new movie, the now-filming ``I Still Know What
You Did Last Summer,'' why she doesn't think on-screen nudity is
for her and what she really thinks of the rumoured competitiveness
between her and ``Party of Five'' co-star/fellow teen-scream star
Neve Campbell. 1,400 words + photo.

<P>
   3. THE X-FILES : THE QUIZ Just before the big-screen version of
the television hit ``The X-Files'' prepares to reach the cinemas,
Tom Frangicetto offers a thought-provoking 16-question quiz to

<P>
   5. COPING WITH THE DEATH OF A STAR The launch of a major motion
picture and the attendant publicity surrounding it is vital to the
way Hollywood does business - particularly if the film has a
multimillion-dollar advertising campaign behind it. It follows then
that the aura of death and mourning does not sit well with the
healthy glow of excitement that is supposed to surround a
nationwide release. And yet, sometimes a film's star will die
before the film hits the screens. Filmmakers have to respond
carefully and sensitively, yet Hollywood seldom loses sight of the
famous adage ``The show must go on ...'' By Joshua Mooney. BPI. 900
words.
</P>
<P>
   _______________________________________________________________
6. THE B-52'S LATEST WAVE Absent for six years, the B-52's are
back. Cindy Wilson, one of the band's singers, waves a figurative
finger in the wind. ``I think,'' she says, ``it might be the right
mood this summer.'' The new wave music of the early '80s has
bubbled up again and the reconstituted, rejuvenated B-52s are
primed to ride yet another wave. By Jim Sullivan. From The Boston
Globe. 1,000 words.
</P>
<P>
   7. ANI DIFRANCO : FOLK-PUNK VOICE The fiercely independent Ani
DiFranco is a rebel. She is proud of her ``indie girl'' status, her
anti-corporate politics, her sexuality, her refusal to sell her
music for TV ads, saying no to playing at famous music festivals
and the creation of her own label, 'Righteous Babe Records.' Her
female empowerment has made her a fascinating subject for the
media, even though analysts forget to mention the most important
ingredient of her success - her music. By Steve Morse. From The
Boston Globe. 1,300 words.

   8. SOFT OPTION Hardware is expensive, so why not write a radio
in software? Radio stations that sound almost as good as a CD could
be with us soon. By Barry Fox. From New Scientist magazine. 500

 &HT;    The story of the larcenist and the lions
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ My lions have been kidnapped, or catnapped.
</P>
<P>
   All that follows is absolutely true. I bought a pair of concrete
lions for the new house, to sit out on the front walk. They weren't
expensive. A small company just south of Lufkin makes and sells
concrete yard art -- lions, dogs, gargoyles, angels and such.
</P>
<P>
   I was looking for a pair of concrete flamingos, but my running
buddy squelched that idea. It's bad enough, she says, that I have a
full-size
</P>
<P>
   cut-out cow that I keep threatening to put in the yard, a
concrete rooster, a statue of St. Francis of Assisi with the bird
on his shoulder missing its head, and a battered weather vane.
She's worried the neighbors might get up a petition about all the
yard art.
</P>
<P>
   So I bought the lions and put them out after the flamingos were
vetoed. Last week, she called me while out inspecting the house,
which is in the final days of construction. The lions were gone.
</P>
<P>
   But this is not a simple act of vandalism or theft, which is
good. In their place were two small ceramic monkeys, the
see-no-evil, and speak-no-evil members of the traditional trio. And
there was a note, sealed in plastic to keep it dry from the water
sprinklers. It read, in part:
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all: Your lions are safe. A few of us animals were
sitting around the other day visiting about things going on in our
lives, when the Lions spoke up and told us a sad tale. They were
lamenting about having to sit on top of this pile of bricks
guarding this new house in this horrible heat.
</P>
<P>
   Then, just about the time the sun goes down and they think they
might get some relief, some little person, dressed like a throwback
from who knows when, comes around and tries to drown them...
(Editor's note: That would be me. As noted last week, I am spending
an inordinate amount of time watering grass at a house I don't yet
live in.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, some of us thought that the lions just needed a break,
you know, a little R and R. Anyway, that's why we are here. Of
course, one of us (monkeys) can't see, and the other won't talk, so
we won't be much help in the case of an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, we are here. After the Lions get their much deserved
rest, we will leave, and they will come home. Until that time, just
be glad that we are here.
</P>
<P>
   It was signed, ``The Monkeys,'' with what appears to be a paw
print in redink.
</P>
<P>
   We obviously have some friends with:
</P>
<P>
   -- Too much time on their hands.
</P>
<P>
   -- A warped sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   -- An ability to lift heavy weights. Those lions weigh about 90
pounds each.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, that did not narrow the list of suspects down
much. First, even the skinny women we know who might have pulled
this stunt have spouses or boyfriends able to lift the lions.
Second, by definition and inclination, all the folks we hang around
have warped senses of humor. Finally, none are too busy to pass up
a good practical joke if the opportunity presents
</P>
<P>
   itself. As it apparently has.
</P>
<P>
   The painters at the house said they like the monkeys better than
the lions. I disagree. I don't much like monkeys in general. I
don't find them cute or particularly amusing. Monkeys are not at
all modest. In fact, they're downright showy.
</P>
<P>
   These ceramic monkeys are about a fifth the size of the lions,
which means from the road it looks like two blond squirrels are
perched on my walkway.
</P>
<P>
   I'm about as fond of squirrels as I am of monkeys. Squirrels are
just rats with bushy tails.
</P>
<P>
   We have unsuccessfully sought the culprit(s) of this caper since
discovering the missing lions last Monday. I have skulked around in
back
</P>
<P>
   yards of a few prime suspects, hoping to discover the purloined
predators, figuring a pre-emptive strike would be a just reward. I
have interrogated several friends who are either innocent or
extremely good liars. Still, no luck and no lions.
</P>
<P>
   I must admit that this was a good practical joke, though enough
time has passed that I'm ready for the lions to return and the
monkeys to get the heck out of Dodge. In the belief that there is
no good defense like a good offense, I have prepared a surprise for
the lion larcenists. It is admittedly a weak response to the
original misdeed, but it was the best I could do under pressure.
</P>
<P>
   There are two pink plastic pigs where the monkeys once squatted.
The monkeys are of course safe. And there's a note explaining the
reverse-ransom conditions, also wrapped in plastic since, despite a
welcome rain late last week, I'm still watering regularly.
</P>
<P>
   My running buddy is getting worried that I'm becoming
inordinately fond of the pigs, which cost $1.97 at Wal-Mart. The
pink (begin ital) does (end ital) somewhat match the color of the
brick.

 &HT;    30 years of sacraments questioned by Palm Beach parishioners
 &HT;    By Shannon Colavecchio
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. _ Still shocked by the news that their
religious leader resigned last week in disgrace, many parishioners
of St. Ignatius Loyola Cathedral on Monday, June 8, questioned the
sanctity of sacraments recently given by Bishop J. Keith Symons.
</P>
<P>
   Symons resigned last week after eight years as bishop of the
Palm Beach Diocese, admitting to sexually molesting five boys about
30 years ago. In the two weeks before his resignation, he
celebrated Mass, heard confession, ordained a few priests and
confirmed 163 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the sacraments are valid,'' Monsignor Thomas Kinzling said
emphatically.
</P>
<P>
   Kinzling, who now leads services at St. Ignatius, said he
considered moving to another church because he was so devastated by
Symons' resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The effect of the sacraments does not depend on the holiness
of the person giving them,'' Kinzling said. ``But it doesn't make
it hurt any less for those people who received sacraments from
(Symons).''
</P>
<P>
   He explained that those recently confirmed ``cannot be
reconfirmed _ that's impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   But the cathedral will hold a ``healing service'' or church
celebration for the 163 people confirmed, and the more than 100
present Monday stressed the need to counsel the parish children,
many of whom are altar servers or altar boys.
</P>
<P>
   Kinzling said counselors from area Catholic charities already
have offered and begun to donate their services. He agreed to start
planning a celebration and support service for the St. Ignatius
parish.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I've heard, most of the children are doing good,''
he said. ``They seem to be doing OK.``
</P>
<P>
   The parishioners began the meeting with a prayer for guidance
and wisdom: ``Do not let us be led by hatefulness. As we gather in
your name, may we temper justice with love.''
</P>
<P>
   Several parishioners expressed concern for Symons and questioned
his future.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I understand, he'll probably get six years of
intense counseling and very little time by himself,'' Kinzling
said, adding he does not know when Synons will retire or whether he
will get retirement benefits. ``His future is not the brightest.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said he is hopeful for St. Ignatius and other Catholic
churches in the Palm Beach Diocese.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to continue our programs, we need to get better
programs,'' Kinzling said. ``We need to continue to be a
child-friendly church. And we need to move on.''

 &HT;    TechnoBuddy: Tips for joining ranks of the nouveau techno-chic
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Once upon a time, if you wanted to be techno-cool it
was enough to have an e-mail account and a fast computer.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays that won't get you into the club. So if the real geeks
and gurus edge away from you at work, I am here today to bring you
a message of hope. You, too, can be a geek, even if you think IRQ
once invaded Kuwait and the chips you are most familiar with come
in a bag.
</P>
<P>
   Even better, I'll show you several free ways to join the digital
elite. Once you've followed these simple steps, Bill Gates still
may not send you a Christmas card, but you'll gain new respect from
all those who wear propellers on their hats.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start at the very beginning -- that dull start-up screen
on your computer. You'll need some new wallpaper. This kind of
wallpaper doesn't come with paste. It's the background image on
your computer screen. Let's replace the dull stuff Windows uses
with one of your favorite photos.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a scanner, you can convert the photo to a digital
image yourself. If you don't have one, most photography places and
some office supply stores can do the conversion for just a few
dollars. Save the image as a bitmap file (that's a file that has a
BMP extension). Then put the image file in your Windows folder.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what to do next. Let's say you called your file
CECIL.BMP. Simply right-click on the screen, go to Display
Properties and you'll find CECIL has been added to your wallpaper
choices. Just select it and there, big as life, is a picture of you
holding that big bass you caught last year.
</P>
<P>
   Things are looking up now, but you still have a long way to go
before you're truly trendy. Now you'll need your own Web page. It
isn't enough to cruise the Web these days, you need a home on the
Web. Personal Web pages are important holding areas for all the bad
poetry you've ever written, for the photographs no one wanted to
see from your last vacation. You'll also want to put in links to
your favorite Web sites. (Be careful with the last item. You really
don't want to put in your favorite Web sites. Instead, use Web
sites that offer impossible-to-understand technical information.
The more technical the Web site, the cooler you are.)
</P>
<P>
   If you are rich and foolish, you can get space to park your Web
page from your current Internet provider. But, unless free Web
space is part of your account, you can use one of the many services
that gives Web space away.
</P>
<P>
   There are literally dozens of outfits that have these free
offers. You can ferret them out using a search engine and the
search words ``free'' and ``Web'' and ``space,'' but I'll give you
one good site right now that will give you 6 megabytes of space
free. It's Geocities, and you'll find the free offer at
http://www.geocities.com/members/.
</P>
<P>
   You could take a community college class and learn to write the
HTML code needed to create the Web page itself. But, instead, let's
go to a free site and download a program called AOL Press. It works
like a word processor and can spit out a Web page in just minutes.
Just drop in at http://www.aolpress.com/index
</P>
<P>
   .html to get your free copy.
</P>
<P>
   You're almost cool now. But there's one crowning touch. Live
chat is very trendy. You can spend hours each night telling
flattering untruths about yourself to complete strangers who, in
return, will do the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   But anyone can log on to one of the chat channels and meet
people. What you need is your very own chat room. Hey, it's the
difference between renting and owning. You'll be able to put a link
to it on the Web page we just built, and instead of meeting your
friends on some public chat channel, you can meet at your place.
</P>
<P>
   Just go to the following Web address -- http://www.parachat.com/
-- and, in just seconds, you'll get everything you need to start
your own chat service.
</P>
<P>
   That's it. You are now technically cool.

 &HT;    ``International'' music of gospel explored by French filmmakers
 &HT;    By Susannah A. Nesmith
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT PIERCE, Fla. _ How do you say ``Operator, information, get
me Jesus on the line'' in French?
</P>
<P>
   A French film producer in Fort Pierce, Florida, to film a local
gospel star would say the music needs no translation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, you have a lot of good talents in this country,''
Joseph Licide said during a break in the filming at Miracle Prayer
Temple on Avenue Q.
</P>
<P>
   Licide and his wife, Regine Abadia, are working on a documentary
on American gospel music for French public television. One of the
segments, filmed Monday, June 8, will be about the Rev. Aubrey
Ghent, pastor of the House of God, a Pentacostal church on North
27th Street. Ghent plays lap steel guitar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reverend Ghent, I think he's the lead lap steel guitar player
of his generation,'' said assistant director Guetty Felin.
</P>
<P>
   Ghent learned lap steel guitar from his father and his uncle.
The instrument resembles the conventional guitar only slightly,
trading the classic acoustic body for a flat surface that is played
horizontally.
</P>
<P>
   Another segment of the documentary was on a Chicago singer,
Ethel Halloway. Halloway put out an album 15 years ago but hasn't
sung much outside of church since then. Felin was able to convince
her to give up baby-sitting her grandchildren for a few days to
come to Florida to sing with Ghent, who accompanied her on the
keyboard along with a Vero Beach minister on a different keyboard
and a drummer from Vero Beach. Four members of Ghent's church sang
back-up. The filming was done in the Miracle Prayer Temple because
the acoustics are better there than in his church. The Port St.
Lucie film office helped Licide's company, Gloria Films, arrange
for production assistants, catering and accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   Licide chose to do a segment on Ghent after hearing one of his
CDs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought the album and I was just astonished,'' Licide said.
</P>
<P>
   Ghent said he wasn't all that surprised when Licide approached
him about doing the documentary.
</P>
<P>
   ``My CD is very popular in France so it's not terribly
surprising,'' he said. ``I was a little surprised as far as a film
goes. I was looking for other audio opportunities, not visual.''

 &HT;    COLUMN: Search for the perfect hot dog leads from Gotham to
Tennessee
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JUNE 11: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Copperhill, Tenn. _ Eat your heart out, New York. While hot dog
vendors are being legislated off the streets of Gotham, here in the
Copper Basin, Raymond Arthur, hot dog maker extraordinaire, still
basks in the glow of appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   I discovered Arthur just as one of my long-standing rituals --
eating a good hot dog from a cart on the streets of New York -- was
being made very difficult to enjoy. In mid-July, sidewalk food
vendors are supposed to be banned from a huge chunk of New York's
Midtown and financial district: 144 blocks. And now comes news that
that's not enough: Some folks are petitioning the city's Sidewalk
Vendor Review Panel to bar vendors from 95 more blocks in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   New York visits won't be the same for me if I can't easily buy a
hot dog, a bag of chips and a Coke at a Midtown corner, sit on the
sunny side of the street and watch the passing parade.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, such cares were a million miles away the other day
when, here in Copperhill, I had my first hot dog at the Curve
Package Store on West Tennessee Avenue, owned by Arthur and his
wife, Fay.
</P>
<P>
   Since Lyn and I bought a cabin in McCaysville (the two towns
share a downtown), a number of people had told me that Arthur knew
dogs. This day, hot and dry, seemed like a good day to try one.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the Bud Man was there, making a delivery.
Barry Johnson of Cleveland, Tenn., added his voice to the chorus of
testimonials for Arthur's steamed hot dogs: ``I've eaten plenty of
them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So, what does he like about them?
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Smiling confidently, Arthur noted that Johnson always has his
hot dog the same way: ketchup, mustard and chili. ``His girlfriend
doesn't want him to eat these onions.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyn's not around; pile some onions on mine, please.
</P>
<P>
   As he laid mine out, Arthur talked with great zest about the
formula for a perfect dog. We agreed that it seems an ideal ood on
a hot summer day; it's a no-sweat dish, somehow evocative of fun
and games and grand old pleasures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found a recipe that everybody likes,'' Arthur is saying,
discreetly ignoring the chili running down my chin, offering a fork
that I decline. ``All-meat wieners, and I make sure they're fresh.
You can't beat a hot dog like that.''
</P>
<P>
   He ought to know. As of this month, he's been making them for 22
years at this same location (named Curve because that's what the
street does). It was 18 years ago that Arthur stopped using wieners
that were not all beef. He recalls a conversation with his
supplier: ``I said, `How about an all-meat wiener.' They said, `We
got 'em.' I said, `Lay 'em on me.'''
</P>
<P>
   And he's been laying 'em on customers ever since. On a good
Saturday, especially if there's a ballgame at the nearby field,
Arthur might sell 200 dogs.
</P>
<P>
   And how many has Barry Johnson eaten?
</P>
<P>
   Calculating quickly with pen and paper, he figured that, during
the last 10 years, he's consumed ``about 2,000.'' And that's just
one man. Who can imagine how many Raymond Arthur has sold at his
beer store?
</P>
<P>
   He says he has always known the value of quality: ``All it takes
is one bad one to stop people from buying.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Johnson hasn't had a bad one. And the first one I had
was just great. I don't know when I'll catch up with his 2,000, but
I'll be working like a dog to do it.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Real life is that thing that happens tomorrow
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ My son counted down the weeks and days leading up
to the Big 7th Birthday Party. ``How many days now, Mom? How many
days?'' I opened my mouth, and my mother started speaking: ``Don't
wish your life away.''
</P>
<P>
   How many times, growing up, had I heard Mom say that? I didn't
have a clue what she meant. When I was 7, a day seemed an
interminable wait. Two weeks? Forget it. The summer stretched into
the unimaginable horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Adults look at time from the other end of the telescope. It's
mere moments since our children were born, and only a few weeks
since we were kids ourselves. Yet, as we tick off each day's tasks
like items on a grocery list, we still find ourselves wishing our
lives away.
</P>
<P>
   As we celebrated Alec's birthday this week, I wanted to go back
to the day I held him the first time. He wore his stylish blue knit
cap, and everybody admitted he was an unusually handsome baby.
</P>
<P>
   When he was a newborn, I couldn't wait for him to sleep through
the night, couldn't wait for that first step, couldn't wait for him
to be able to play by himself for a luxurious five or 10 minutes at
a time.
</P>
<P>
   Now I wanted to go back to the beginning. He had come too far,
too fast, more than a third of the distance to independence,
separation from us.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted time in the abstract to slow down, but I wanted this
day to be over, the sooner the better. If I could only get through
this party, I'd be sane again, I could rest. Twenty-five kids in
the back yard, industrial-strength blue icing ground into the
driveway. Hadn't I vowed I would never throw another home birthday
party? What had I been thinking?
</P>
<P>
   Oh yes, now I remembered. I decided to do the party at home
because a friend, who goes by the alias Dexterous Dan the Juggling
Man, generously offered to do his show for Alec's birthday.
</P>
<P>
   I snapped lots of pictures, but I knew I wouldn't need them to
remember the moment: Dan juggled bowling balls and machetes! He
chomped bites of an apple while juggling it! Flame-throwing!
Fire-eating! Kids cheered and clapped, held spellbound by something
even more mesmerizing than TV or Nintendo.
</P>
<P>
   The show ended, and, with it, my short-lived experiment in
living-for-the-moment. Once again, I prayed for deliverance from
this day. How did I get to be middle-aged _ old enough to
understand that time is finite _ and still wishing my life away?
</P>
<P>
   We spend our childhood and young adulthood straining for that
next milestone. In the spring we can't wait for school to get out;
in late summer we can't wait for school to start. We can't wait to
drive our first car, can't wait to go away to college. We can't
wait to get that first job, can't wait to get a better one.
</P>
<P>
   Now we don't wish huge chunks of our lives away _ just a lot of
little chunks. How many days do you wake up, and wish the day over
before it has begun? ``If I can only get through this project/this
week/this overscheduled day, life will be good.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the first week of summer, and Alec can't wait for camp to
start in two weeks. ``How many days, Mom? How many days?'' I open
my mouth, and my mother starts speaking: ``Stop wishing your life
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I should start listening to her.

 &HT;    Clinton wins legal delay
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Bill Clinton is the O.J. Simpson of American
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Juice, Clinton can look people in the eye, tell
outrageous lie after outrageous lie and get away with it.
</P>
<P>
   That's a devil's gift that says more about the people who allow
themselves to be deceived than it does the deceiver.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his walking-dead disciples have been telling
bewitched Americans that independent counsel Kenneth Starr is
dragging out his investigation into the growing cloud of alleged
high crimes and misdemeanors that swirl like Georgia gnats around
Bill and Hillary.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's tactic from the beginning of the Whitewater
investigation has been delay, delay, delay. Clinton stonewalls,
footdrags, throws up roadblocks, invents legal dodges and changes
stories in a non-stop attempt to impede Starr's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his spellbound attendants simultaneously blame Starr
for dragging out the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   This duplicitous tactic couldn't be more evident than in
Clinton's repeated attempts to invent special privileges whenever
Starr requests information.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the claim is executive privilege, attorney-client
privilege, marital privilege or some other pretend privilege,
Clinton steadfastly refuses to comply with reasonable requests that
could expedite the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's delaying tactic, blamed on Starr, has been thrown out
by one court decision after another.
</P>
<P>
   After Federal District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson rejected yet
another of Clinton's stonewalling privilege claims, Starr was moved
to ask the Supreme Court to speed matters up by deciding these
claims without going through the normal appeals process.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone doubted that Clinton wants to delay the investigation,
then that doubt should have been swept away when the president sent
his legal minions to the Supreme Court to argue against bypassing
the normal appeals process because he wants to delay Starr's
ability to gather information needed to complete the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The justices turned down Starr's request to make emergency
decisions on Clinton's appeal of his rejected privilege claims,
which is a victory for Clinton's tactic of delaying and shifting
the blame.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's stonewalling tactics are not limited to Starr's
attempt to investigate criminal charges leveled against the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton fought every request by the House Government Operations
and Affairs Committee, even to the point of claiming executive
privilege for over 3,000 pages of documents.
</P>
<P>
   In the Clinton White House, records routinely disappear.
Sometimes they magically reappear. Clinton has pulled this stunt
with billing records, FBI background files on prominent
Republicans, files from the phony firings in the White House travel
office, files from deputy White House counsel Vince Foster's office
and files of White House donors lists.
</P>
<P>
   Ross Perot may not have been only a year off when he warned that
Clinton's re-election would presage ``a constitutional crisis in
1997.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is easy to figure. It's a real puzzle, however, to
understand why so many Americans turn a blind eye to his outrageous
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   In an April 9, 1992 Time/CNN poll less than six months before
his election, 53 percent of Americans said ``No'' when asked ``Is
Bill Clinton honest and trustworthy enough to be president.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if Clinton ``would say anything to get elected
president,'' 67 percent said ``Yes'' while 62 percent said ``No''
when asked if Clinton is ``someone you would be proud to have as
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is the O.J. Simpson of American politics.

 &HT;    Mom's tale shows it's smart to listen for the Bogeyman
 &HT;    By Emily J. Minor
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Here's why a mother named Patricia
Fowler Bouton is my new idol:
</P>
<P>
   Let's pretend it's 9 at night and your 8-year-old comes out of
her bedroom. She says she hears something. It's scaring her. She
can't sleep.
</P>
<P>
   You, a woman who recently won Mother Of The Year and possess the
pinched nerve in your neck to prove it, do what any good mother
would do.
</P>
<P>
   You roll your eyes and say:
</P>
<P>
   Go.
</P>
<P>
   To.
</P>
<P>
   Bed.
</P>
<P>
   Right.
</P>
<P>
   Now. And you say it in a tone of voice that leaves your throat a
little scratchy.
</P>
<P>
   That's why this Patricia lady from Maryland City, Md., is on the
top of my list.
</P>
<P>
   No, she did not return a wallet containing $100,000 to the
owner, who then wept for three days because it was his money for a
new kidney. And she did not win a big lottery and start free day
care nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   This is better. She actually listened when her son came out of
his room one night and said he couldn't sleep because he was
hearing noises.
</P>
<P>
   Turned out it's a good thing she did because there was a man, a
burglar, asleep under the kid's bed. Apparently the guy got trapped
inside the house when the family came home.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is that at some point in the evening . . . (the man)
had gone into the room to hide because he couldn't leave the house
and subsequently fell asleep,'' said Tracy Morgan, the officer who
handled the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``He woke up on the way to the station and asked what was going
on,'' Morgan said.
</P>
<P>
   Ay caramba! If that was our house, the bad guy would still be
snoozing there. Because the truth about listening? If you do it too
much, you're bound to hear some stuff you didn't really want to
know.
</P>
<P>
   You see, I have what would be called Selective Listening. I
consistently fail to hear things like: Mom, can I have ice cream
for dinner? And, Mom, can Robert come live with us for a week?
Which bothers me. Because if I'm blocking out the little stuff,
it's certain I'm missing some bigger stuff as well. Right?
</P>
<P>
   Yet, just let a mango land on the porch roof and I am convinced
it's an escaped prisoner with a grudge on society and a claw
hammer.
</P>
<P>
   The ceiling fan rattles the newspaper on the table and I think
it's a rat chewing through the wall.
</P>
<P>
   A branch scratches the metal awnings outside our bedroom window.
I think it's Armageddon and curse the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why Patricia is my new idol. Because not only did she
have the good sense to listen, she also had the good sense to check
out what she heard.
</P>
<P>
   She's living proof: There could be a bad man under your little
kid's bed. There could be a prisoner on the back porch. There could
be a rat in the wall.
</P>
<P>
   And that noise? That one I'm hearing right now? It's either a
train derailment, or my nose whistling. I'll get back to you when I
know for sure.

 &HT;    Sidaway's accusal inspired others to come forth, says lawyer
 &HT;    By Dan Moffett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 11-year-old altar boy with the wide smile and neatly parted
hair could stand it no more.
</P>
<P>
   He sat down with his mother and told her the brutal, graphic
details of his unbearable ordeals. He said the parish priest, a
trusted family friend, had sexually molested him many times during
the weeks before.
</P>
<P>
   Shaken and bewildered, the mother called her husband at the post
office where he worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``What should we do?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe him,'' the father replied, ``because the same thing
happened to me when I was a child.''
</P>
<P>
   The year was 1967, and Kevin Sidaway's long, anguished recovery
had officially begun. The 11-year-old had made his stand _ against
the predator rapist, against the Catholic Church, against the
insidious problem that ran wider and deeper than he could imagine,
damaging one generation then the next.
</P>
<P>
   Through the following three decades, Sidaway's courage would be
tested by the unrelenting memories of his tortured childhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am constantly flooded with the images of me and my friends
having to endure these indignities,'' Sidaway said this week, his
voice trembling. ``There is no greater betrayal than having your
priest violate you. I have to live with anger every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, at 42, Sidaway has become, like his father, a postal
employee. He delivers mail along the Intracoastal Waterway in Lake
Worth, going door to door in the small resort area where people
know the people who stay when the snowbirds leave.
</P>
<P>
   Sidaway's name is known because he decided to make it so.
</P>
<P>
   He did not file suit against the Catholic Church and his abuser,
Father Rocco D'Angelo, as an anonymous ``John Doe.'' He did it four
years ago as Kevin Sidaway.
</P>
<P>
   He has not become the champion for molestation victims by quiet
work. He has spoken out loudly. He has spoken out often. And he has
spoken with his name: Kevin Sidaway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin is a man who has come forward and said one of the
hardest things for a man to say,'' said James G. Souza III, a Tampa
attorney who represents four other former altar boys, ``John
Does,'' who were victimized by D'Angelo.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he stood up and said it anyway. I have never met him, but
my clients would like to talk to him to thank him. He gave them the
strength to pick up the telephone and come forward, too. If he
never does anything in his life, this is something truly great. It
was the bravest thing I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 10 other victims have since come forward and accused
D'Angelo of sexual assaults. Two weeks ago, Sidaway reached an
undisclosed settlement of his civil suit against the church. A
separate case is pending against D'Angelo, who has admitted
assaults against numerous victims.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Rev. J. Keith Symons, bishop of the Diocese of Palm
Beach, was forced to step down after admitting he had sexually
molested five boys more than three decades ago. Symons had been
chancellor of the St. Petersburg diocese in the 1970s when D'Angelo
was transferred there, after leaving St. Mark's church in Boynton
Beach where he terrorized Sidaway.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church covers up its own, one pedophile protecting
another,'' Sidaway said. ``There is a mindset in the church that
can blow away the souls of our children. If any of us had the
chance to stop the Oklahoma City bombing and save all those lives,
the lives of all those children, wouldn't we do it? I did what I
did for the same reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   The sheer horror of D'Angelo's attacks has left a darkness
within Sidaway that 25 years of therapy have tried to remove. He
has fought off alcohol and thoughts of suicide. As an altar boy,
Sidaway would cinch his wide black leather belt, the uniform of the
parochial school, as tight as he could stand it in the hope it
would protect him from D'Angelo. The daily struggle now is to
harness his rage.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I believed it was Jesus Christ that was raping me,''
Sidaway said. ``I would shake my fist at God. I would literally
curse him. I would call him every name in the book. I would tell
him to come down from heaven so I could fight him and whip him
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Sidaway and two of his fellow altar boys first confronted the
church in '67. They sat before three priests in an office at St.
Vincent DePaul's on Military Trail in Boynton Beach. Sidaway
remembers the exchanges vividly.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told us we should forget Father D'Angelo,'' he said.
``They said it was wrong to molest little children. They told us
that we should not go out and molest children when we grew up
because it was a sin. They asked us if it would be all right with
us if Father D'Angelo was sent somewhere where he could never hurt
children again. We all nodded yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years later, Sidaway learned D'Angelo had not been
``sent away'' _ but transferred to St. Petersburg, where he would
claim more victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was absolutely heartbroken,'' Sidaway said. ``I couldn't
understand how the church had allowed more children to be hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Learning that too much time had passed to pursue criminal action
against D'Angelo, Sidaway took his anger to civil court and
targeted the church hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a monster, and they protected him,'' Sidaway said.
``Money will not satiate my anger. But I believe all victims should
take every dollar they can from the church. I will continue legal
action against D'Angelo. He will be hunted and haunted the rest of
his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, Sidaway has developed a formula for living.
He confronts each thought as it comes to him, good or bad. ``I
cannot let the events of the past destroy me,'' he has said to
himself countless times.
</P>
<P>
   He takes comfort in the love of his family, his 21-year-old
daughter and his sons, 20 and 19, and draws strength from the
devotion of Maureen, his wife of 22 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has helped me so much,'' he said. ``She always told me:
God is not the author of what happened to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Sidaway's faith today comes from within. He occasionally attends
a Protestant church with Maureen; he reads the scripture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pretty much turn the pages of the Bible as well as anyone
else,'' he says. ``I don't need anyone to preach to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Further inspiration comes from that photograph of the
11-year-old with the wide smile and neatly parted hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``That child . . . I've always felt he has been crying out to me
for justice,'' Sidaway said. ``He was the one who gave me the
courage to go through this. I couldn't let him down.''

 &HT;    The hardest part of knowing how to cook may be knowing when to
stop
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JUNE 11: DFO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anne Willan examined the roast chickens that a student at her La
Varenne Cooking School in France was about to put back into the
oven and declared, ``Those look done to me!''
</P>
<P>
   The student, who was simply checking on the progress of the
birds, was puzzled. ``How do you know?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   Willan's first reaction was simply to say it was instinct. ``But
then I realized I do know. It looked crispy brown. It sizzled. You
could wiggle the leg, and it smelled heavenly.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of us have had those puzzling moments in the kitchen. The
recipe said to cook the roast for an hour. So why is it still so
rare? Your mother always told you to boil corn about 10 minutes,
but when you do, the kernels are shriveled and dry.
</P>
<P>
   Professional chefs such as Willan have learned that the answers
to such questions don't come from some divine inspiration, but
rather by using all five senses to carefully observe the cooking
process.
</P>
<P>
   Christophe Bruehwiler of Bruehwiler's Bakery in Sandy Springs
says he knows when a loaf of bread is done by touching it. ``It's
like the people you see thumping the watermelon at the farmers
market. You turn the loaf of bread upside down and hit the bottom
with your knuckles,'' he explained. ``If you hear a hollow sound,
then you know it's done.''
</P>
<P>
   For cookies, Bruehwiler goes mainly by sight. As a batch of
cookies nears the end of the baking process, he begins to watch.
``The recipe may say seven minutes. That doesn't mean the cookie
will be done in your oven in seven minutes,'' he said. ``A cookie
is so small and fragile, and a minute can really change the color
and the texture. So you have to look.''
</P>
<P>
   Famed Southern chef Edna Lewis says she can ``hear'' when a cake
is done. How? By pulling it from the oven and holding it to her
ear. If she hears ``quiet bubbling,'' she knows it's not quite
ready. When the bubbling subsides, she knows it's done.
</P>
<P>
   Detecting the moment of optimum doneness is arguably the most
important skill a cook can master, especially in dishes unadorned
with sauces or fancy dressings. ``When you cook things very pure,
then it shows all the mistakes,'' said chef Guenter Seeger of
Seeger's restaurant in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Cook It Right: Achieve Perfection With Every Dish You
Cook'' (Reader's Digest Books, $29.95), Willan tells home chefs how
to recognize exactly when more than 150 types of ingredients and
foods are cooked to perfection, from lobster to french fries.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I think people these days know a lot more about food,
they know a lot less about cooking,'' said Willan. ``They simply
don't recognize when something is well-cooked.''
</P>
<P>
   She drew on her own experience as the founder of La Varenne, the
famed cooking school, and as a cookbook author. She also sought the
secrets of expert chefs around the world. To illustrate, hundreds
of photographs and explanations of overcooked and undercooked
dishes are shown, next to their perfectly cooked counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Even for experienced cooks, she found that there is sometimes
but one way to achieve the precise product they're seeking:
old-fashioned trial and error.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't get a cake to fall, and we couldn't get a dark
line around the yolk of a boiled egg to show an overdone egg,''
laughed Willan. ``We ended up boiling 60 eggs for that one
picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Steak
</P>
<P>
   Underdone: The meat offers no resistance when pressed, and beads
of meat juice do not yet rise to the surface. Rare: Surface is
well-browned; meat is spongy when pressed in the center; beads of
juice are deep pink. Medium: Surface is crusty brown and meat
resists when the center is pressed; firm at the sides; beads of
juice on surface are deep pink. Well-done: Surface is crusty brown
and dry; meat is firm when pressed; beads of juice on surface are
clear.
</P>
<P>
   A perfect custard sauce will be creamy and smooth, and a clear
trail is left when a finger is drawn across the spoon. Flavor is
delicate, perfumed with vanilla.
</P>
<P>
   Green beans cooked just right will be tender enough to bend but
still slightly crisp. They're easy to cut with a knife. The color
is vivid and the taste well-defined and fresh.
</P>
<P>
   When a knife or fork is inserted at the thickest part of the
fish, the flesh nearest the bone flakes away easily and is no
longer translucent. The eye is opaque. If baked, barbecued, broiled
or pan-fried, the skin should be browned and crisp.
</P>
<P>
   A perfect muffin will be deep golden and starting to shrink from
the pan; the center rises to a shallow, cracked peak, and a skewer
inserted into the center comes out clean (but may be moist with
fruit). The inside texture is spongy and the muffin is fragrant.
Holey muffins (upper left) will be tunneled and often have a high,
broken peak as a result of overmixing or too much rising agent.
Underbaked muffins (upper middle) will be wet in the center, with a
pale crust; the batter has not yet peaked or begun to shrink from
the pan. Heavy muffins (upper right) have a batter that scarcely
rises, and the top of the muffin is flat; the crust is pale.
Overmixing is most likely the culprit.
</P>
<P>
   Pasta is ready when tender but still firm to the bite; pieces
show no tendency to stick together, and flavor is nutty. String
pasta, such as spaghetti and linguine, can be cut with your
thumbnail.

 &HT;    Cormac McCarthy in same league as Faulkner
 &HT;    By Jay Milner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ I can remember clearly -- and you can too if
you're old enough to have grown grandchildren -- when Texas was
still pretty much a frontier state. It wasn't that long ago, if you
count in lifetimes.
</P>
<P>
   There was no Cotton Bowl; no big league baseball teams; no pro
football teams; no William Faulkner, if you believed at least one
Lone Star best-selling author; the most widely acclaimed
Texas-based writers were pretty much historians and folklorists, if
you didn't count William Humphrey, who lived in Spain much of the
time although his works are set in Texas. And Katherine Ann Porter
more or less denied her Texas roots.
</P>
<P>
   But, boy hidee, has time changed things in our state! Time and I
don't know what all, including the infernal influx of people of all
denominations and persuasions for all kinds of reasons, mostly
economic. And once they were here, fluctuating economic conditions
left them stranded here.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, time marched relentlessly on and the Texas
population grew until, the fact is, there are too darned many
people living within our vast borders nowadays.
</P>
<P>
   But Texans in every direction are now writing and getting
published and some are writing very well, thank you. We might even
have a Faulkner or two.
</P>
<P>
   Time will tell.
</P>
<P>
   My nomination for a ``Texas Faulkner'' lives way over in El Paso
and is one of those outsiders who moved into the state some time
back for reasons we can only guess at after reading his books,
which are mostly about the dying and dead age of the Texas cowboy.
At least they are so far, but he's a fairly young fellow and no
telling what he'll write about down the road.
</P>
<P>
   His name, in case you haven't already figured it out, is Cormac
McCarthy and he's what you call a ``Serious Writer.'' That is to
say, he doesn't crank out formula novels aimed at being made into
movies, although I hear one of his appears bound for the silver
screen, as we used to call it.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy first came to my attention, as he did many others, with
his novel, ``All the Pretty Horses,'' the first of a trilogy. It is
so very good it made me tell my reading friends to be sure and read
it, and many did and were equally impressed.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a few years later, along came Number Two, ``The
Crossing.'' I didn't get into it as completely as I had ``All the
Pretty Horses,'' but it is another winner.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the final book of the trilogy -- ``Cities of the
Plain,'' (Knopf). I have some complaints about this one, as I did
about the other two, but it is a mesmerizing tale that won't leave
your mind once it's in there.
</P>
<P>
   All three of the books in McCarthy's trilogy might be called
Larry McMurtry on acid. That wouldn't be truly accurate, but it
would be in the right direction. This latest one, number three, is
set on a ranch just outside of El Paso in New Mexico in 1952. The
major characters are John Grady Cole, a terminally idealistic young
cowboy who should have lived in a previous, more innocent time, and
his buddy, Billy Parham, nine years older and ages wiser.
</P>
<P>
   You may remember Billy from ``All the Pretty Horses.''
</P>
<P>
   This one is primarily a love story, a tragedy in a manner of
speaking, although there probably was no other way it could have
gone. The prose is almost poetic. Cormac McCarthy writes like a man
possessed.
</P>
<P>
   My complaints mentioned above have to do with the fact that the
character sometimes speak Spanish at some length and we aren't told
what they are saying by any of the means other writers have used
when their characters speak in other tongues. Maybe that's picky,
but I resented him making it harder for me to follow his story. But
I didn't resent it enough to stop reading. The writing and the
story are too beautifully told to even consider stopping.
</P>
<P>
   Trust me. This man Cormac McCarthy plays in the same ballpark as
the late Mr. Faulkner and other American greats. If you miss him,
you'll be sorry somewhere down the line.
</P>

 &HT;    Are parents sending teens mixed signals on drinking?
 &HT;    By Carolyn Susman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just say ``maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents are sending this confused message about drugs and
alcohol to their teenagers, according to a new survey by the
Hazelden Foundation, a national nonprofit drug treatment program
based in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of the parents questioned _ 60 percent _ said
they would tell their children not to drink, but would ask them to
call for a ride home if they became intoxicated.
</P>
<P>
   Only 23 percent said they would flatly forbid their teens to
drinkuntil the legal age, 21.
</P>
<P>
   And questions about prom night resulted in a lot of
backpedaling. Nearly all of those surveyed _ 92 percent _ said they
would not allow their children to drink on prom night. But a third
backed down and settled for lecturing their teens about the
consequences when told drinking would be part of the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not really a surprise,'' says Adele Kempe, family program
supervisor at the Hanley-Hazelden Center, a drug and alcohol
treatment facility in West Palm Beach. ``We know that parents are
struggling with this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   But children who don't get a direct and unwavering response take
a mixed message as permission to experiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parent must provide a clear message: `I don't want you to
use it. I'm going to provide some very clear consequences if you
do.' And then stick with it,'' Kempe stresses.
</P>
<P>
   Parents need to talk to their children, beginning before the
children reach their teens, and reinforce an anti-drug approach.
</P>
<P>
   But don't lecture. Encourage children to explain how they feel
about drugs, what kind of pressure they're under from peers, and to
discuss news reports when teens are involved in auto accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Parents also must be aware of their own behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty-two percent of the parents drink in front of their
children,'' Kempe notes. ``If the parent only uses alcohol on a
rare occasion . . . the child will get the message that once in a
while it's appropriate as an adult.''
</P>
<P>
   It's important, also, for teens to look beyond the buzz that
alcohol or drugs might provide momentarily to longterm
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``A child is fighting a battle with drugs and alcohol at a much
earlier age _ (studies find) first use of alcohol is at 13, and of
marijuana is 14 _ and he or she needs to know the parent is in the
trenches with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to believe there will be consequences. They need to
blame it on their mothers or fathers. They need to say, `They would
kill me. I can't.' ''

 Forbes Exec Rose From Dust Of Rivals  
 By Tom Abate   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Behind Rich Karlgaard's annointment as publisher of Forbes
magazine lies a dramatic comeback story.
</P>
<P>
   It involves Karlgaard and two former partners turned
competitors: fellow magazine publishers Tony Perkins of Red Herring
and David Bunnell of Upside.
</P>
<P>
   The story begins in 1989 when Karlgaard, then a humble technical
writer, and Perkins, an ambitious ex-banker, decided to found a
magazine about Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Though short on money and publishing experience, they had
already made many friends in the valley by founding the Churchill
Club, San Jose's answer to San Francisco's Commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
   With Perkins handling sales and Karlgaard driving editorial,
they gave birth to Upside. A few investors _ led by Perkins's
lifelong pal, venture capitalist Tim Draper _ bankrolled this
quixotic effort.
</P>
<P>
   But, undercapitalized from the start, by 1992 Upside was
scrambling to meet payroll. At that point, Bunnell joined Upside's
board of directors to help turn around the flailing magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Already a computer publishing legend, Bunnell had helped launch
a string of successful magazines, including Macworld. But after
Bunnell joined Upside's board, the two founders were eventually
eased out and Bunnell slowly tightened his grip on Upside, which he
has nursed back to profit and prominence.
</P>
<P>
   Karlgaard emerged from the Upside putsch better off. By 1992 he
had befriended futurist George Gilder, whose ideas had bedazzled
magazine magnate Steve Forbes. To create an editorial pulpit for
Gilder, Forbes hired Karlgaard to edit Forbes ASAP, the bimonthly
tech magazine that turned out to be Karlgaard's steppingstone to
Forbes magazine.
</P>
<P>
   While Karlgaard's star was ascending, Perkins was sliding into a
personal and professional slump. Nonetheless, within in a year
Perkins created the Red Herring. With financial backing from
co-founder Chris Alden, he has spent the last five years making the
Herring a force in the valley _ and vindicating himself.
</P>
<P>
   Karlgaard said there was a time when he and Perkins ``were both
mad at each other and certain people on the (Upside) board.'' Since
then, he and Perkins have patched it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real story here,'' Karlgaard said, looking back on the
Upside days, ``is that out of that one troubled kernel, three
successful magazines have sprung up.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; F.Y.I. &LR;  This fall, Upside will move from San Mateo to San
Francisco, taking a floor in the same building on 731 Market Street
that houses Mother Jones.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; 3Com Spin: &LR;  Sources close to 3Com ridicule the notion that the
company's decision to hire a second in command signals any loss of
faith in Eric Benhamou, the company's chairman, president and CEO.
</P>
<P>
   The hunt for a new president and COO, being conducted by Spencer
Stuart, has so far turned up three possible candidates _ all from
outside the networking industry.
</P>
<P>
   Benhamou recently got the supreme compliment from Cisco CEO John
Chambers, who told reporters that when headhunters phone him, ``I
send them over to Eric. I want somebody to hire that guy out of my
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; New dimension: &LR;  Intervista, the San Francisco startup that
pioneered 3D browsers for the Internet, will be acquired by
Platinum Technology, an Ohio corporate-software firm.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will be announced any day. 3D guru and company founder
Tony Parisi will be among the 28 Intervistites who will don
Platinum name tags. But Intervista President John Lukrich, who
engineered the deal, will supposedly leave to explore new pastures.
</P>
<P>
   The deal highlights the fact that 3D, once heralded as the next
big thing on the Web, is still a ways off. In April, Silicon
Graphics announced plans to spin off _ or disband _ its 120-person
3D effort called Cosmo.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Kudos &LR;  to the California Secretary of State's office for the
superb presentation of election results on its Web site. Bookmark

 Reputed King of Junk E-mail Says He's Through Spamming  
 By Jon Swartz   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The spam king has abdicated his throne and become a turncoat.
</P>
<P>
   Sanford Wallace _ the self-anointed ``Spamford,'' who claimed to
make millions of dollars peddling unsolicited commercial e-mail but
angered millions of Internet users in the process _ says he is
ditching the industry he pioneered and will testify against
spammers in court in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a wonderful twist of fate,'' said Wallace, who once
boasted of being the world's biggest junk e-mailer.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace vows he will speak out against spammers as an expert
witness in lawsuits against the junk e-mailers. He will work for
the same law firm that in March won a $2 million lawsuit against
him on behalf of Internet service provider EarthLink Network Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Sanford's penance,'' said Pete Wellborn, the
Atlanta-based attorney for EarthLink. ``His knowledge of e-mail
practices and the Internet is so vast that I can think of no one
I'd rather have as my technical consultant.''
</P>
<P>
   Many observers contend that Wallace and his company, Cyber
Promotions Inc., were forced out of business by an avalanche of
litigation. At least five ISPs, including America Online,
CompuServe and Concentric Network, have successfully sued Cyber
Promotions in recent years to evict it from their sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legal climate makes it much more difficult to be a
spammer,'' said Randall Boe, AOL's associate general counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace's defection underscores a growing nationwide crackdown
on unsolicited commercial e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is considering at least four bills that would either
ban or restrict spam; ISPs are suing junk e-mailers at a furious
clip; and Internet services are offering software that lets
subscribers block unwanted e-mail from specific Internet addresses.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the Internet is being buried under the flurry of
an estimated 13 billion pieces of junk e-mail a year, most of which
tout sleazy sex ads, get-rich-quick schemes and miracle drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Since surfacing three years ago, spam has become so pervasive
that it is clogging up Internet pathways and individuals' e-mail
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Cyber Promotions was among the most egregious offenders. The
privately owned company delivered millions ofpieces of junk e-mail
last year on behalf of clients hawking vitamin supplements,
luxurious vacations and health and beauty aids.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can only hope that Mr. Wallace disappears for good, but I
wouldn't bet on it,'' said Paul Hoffman, director of the Internet
Mail Consortium in Santa Cruz, which represents 30 companies,
including AOL, Microsoft and Netscape. ``He is the consummate
salesman who has a habit of resurfacing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman and others assert that Wallace beat a hasty retreat
before anti-spam laws go into the books. Previously, Wallace was a
prolific sender of junk-mail faxes before legislation drove him
from that field.
</P>
<P>
   ``People on the Internet are not going to stand for spam,''
Wallace admitted in a recent interview. ``I will give back to the
Internet by spending time and effort to help clean up the
streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, the normally loquacious Wallace _ who has compared
himself to Madonna and Howard Stern _ isn't saying anything else.
</P>
<P>
   He is tight-lipped about his future plans in marketing, and the
status of Cyber Promotions is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   The Dresher, Pa., company's phone numbers are either
disconnected or go unanswered.

world in 1983 and 1984, he went six months without sleeping more
than one night in the same place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have an enormous interest in knowledge and knowing,'' says
Rao.
</P>
<P>
   Now 35, he's chief technology officer at Inxight (pronounced
``insight''), one of several startups at Xerox's Palo Alto Research
Center (PARC). At PARC, Rao has spent the past eight years helping
create Inxight's software, a new graphical user interface that's
intended to make it easier to get at and organize information.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a computer, you're never in a flow state. You feel like
you're on the phone with someone stupid trying to get them to do
something simple,'' Rao said.
</P>
<P>
   Called the Hyperbolic Tree, the interface lets users see and
easily navigate an entire bank of information _ a Web site, an
organizational chart, a database _ at one glance. Instead of having
to click and scroll through numerous areas, users of the tree can
just select one area to zoom in on that information while shrinking
the rest of the display. It's fast and fluid, and it's especially
useful for Web surfing or handling huge amounts of related
information.
</P>
<P>
   Rao also co-invented Inxight's Table Lens, a technique for
viewing large tables of data that enables users to quickly pick out
patterns and anomalies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cars made all of us be able to run like leopards,'' he says.
``These tools could make us all think more like Einstein.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in India, Rao spent most of his youth in Texas, where his
father taught aerospace engineering at Texas A&AMP;M University.
</P>
<P>
   He was the only Indian in his class at school, but he says he
was seldom teased about his nationality. Most of his classmates
were more concerned whether he was ``a Yankee or a Rebel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I said I'm from southern India, so I guess I'm a Rebel,'' Rao
recalls.
</P>
<P>
   He zipped through his studies easily _ in fifth grade, he zoomed
through 200 biographies _ and by the end of eighth grade, Rao had
read all the high school's math books. When his family moved to
Bellevue, Wash., he skipped 10th grade and graduated a year early.
</P>
<P>
   Rao went to MIT in 1979 planning to major in math; however, he
really was undecided about his future. He wanted to be a novelist.
He wanted to be an academic like his parents. (His mother got her
doctorate in microbiology after the family moved to the United
States.) He wanted to travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to go to college and take the introductory course in
every subject,'' says Rao.
</P>
<P>
   He tested out of every freshman math and science course. Someone
told him about a computer science course but warned him that it was
too tough for freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``So of course I went into computer science almost
immediately,'' he says. It also fit his need to put off making
decisions about his life.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1980, Rao got a job at PARC. He was 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked in and put my hand on a mouse, and I thought, `This
is going to change the world,''' says Rao. ``That inspired me, and
that inspiration is part of what set me off on these paths.''
</P>
<P>
   Rao finished his bachelor's degree and spent what would have
been his senior year working at a consulting firm to earn money. He
was reluctant to commit to a career in computer science _ or any
other career. After graduation, he set off with a backpack to
travel around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Although many people thought he was foolish not to immediately
grab the opportunities available to a bright, young computer
scientist, Rao recalls that PARC's director, John Seely Brown,
encouraged him to travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a profoundly creative mind, a passion for life and a
good feeling for technology,'' Brown recalls. ``I'm a firm believer
in the need to develop balanced creative geniuses.''
</P>
<P>
   The trip didn't really hurt Rao's technical career. When he
returned 13 months later, he began working toward his master's
degree at MIT. He went to work at PARC in 1986 and finished his
degree there in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the team working on the user interface in 1990.
Inxight was formed six years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``One feeling I had at PARC was that I could figure out the next
big thing,'' Rao says. The Inxight projects interested him because
it was practical and possible. ``I wanted it (what he worked on) to
be something I cared about and could see in the world.''

 3Com Seeks New Exec To Run Daily Operations  
 By Jonathan Marshall   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   3Com Corp., the Santa Clara computer networking company, said it
is recruiting a new senior executive to help manage day-to-day
operations.
</P>
<P>
   The company has interviewed a handful of candidates since it
began the search in late April. Depending on his or her
qualifications, the person 3Com hires could become chief operating
officer or president, under Eric Benhamou, 3Com's current
president, chief executive and chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Benhamou is said to be seeking more time to focus on strategic
issues while off-loading some of his daily responsibilities. His
job has grown far more complex since 3Com acquired U.S. Robotics
last year, roughly doubling the company's size and giving it a huge
new stake in the consumer market.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, 3Com has been buffeted by severe price competition
in many of its product lines and by slower than expected demand for
its latest generation of 56K modems.
</P>
<P>
   The company's slumping profits contributed to a collapse of its
share price, from nearly $35 in early May to a close of $24
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Pyykkonen, an analyst with CIBC Oppenheimer, said 3Com
has failed to make up in volume for drastic price cuts on modems
and network interface cards, which let computers plug into company
networks. The price of such cards has fallen by half over the past
year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   3Com has also failed to gain significant market share for
higher-end corporate networking equipment, which enjoys higher
margins, Pyykkonen said.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for a new chief operating officer, Pyykkonen said,
will be to help 3Com improve its manufacturing efficiencies and
retail distribution of mass production items like modems. The new
hire will also have to find ways to drive new product development
without raising expenses and squeezing profits.

 PCs Will Bring Personal Touch to Political Campaigns  
 By Tom Abate   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Former political technology guru Dan Jones helped me see the
silver lining inside another election clouded by big money and
negative TV ads.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, now with an Internet startup in San Francisco, said that
when he started doing political work for the Democrats in the
1970s, it took a mainframe computer to run a door-to-door campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, a PC can do it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Schweitzer, a Republican tech specialist from Washington
state, said the idea is to build a database of ``swing'' voters _
people not loyal to either party. The high-tech campaign tries to
reach these voters with direct mail or other appeals.
</P>
<P>
   So why do the major candidates throw all their money at the Boob
Tube? San Francisco State University professor Gary Selnow, author
of several books on campaign technology, blames inertia.
</P>
<P>
   ``TV has a long history of success in politics, and politicians
go with what they know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Selnow thinks that database techniques, combined with
Internet delivery, could revolutionize campaigns, replacing
mass-media appeals with one-on-one tactics that grassroots groups
could employ as readily as the rich.
</P>
<P>
   Net campaigns will start by using e-mail and Web sites to reach
supporters, and graduate to sending video clips that cost far less
than TV ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think a new generation of techniques is arising that
will, to some extent, bring back the type of person-to-person
campaign we haven't seen for a while,'' said Elisabeth Provinse, a
Washington, D.C., political expert since 1970.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Reality check &LR; : Whatever their future, Net campaigns ain't all
ready for prime time _ yet.
</P>
<P>
   When the pro-226 campaign bought a modest $5,000 banner ad on
the Hotmail Web site, the Net-heads and politicos had a tiff over
the meaning of GIF.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Hotmail) called us and said, `You need to get a jiff
(file),''' said campaign spokesman Mitch Zak. ``I said, `What's
that ... peanut butter?'''
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; S.F. confidential: &LR;  The e-mail marked ``confidential'' should
never have reached my in-box.
</P>
<P>
   But Alexander Communications goofed and sent me an in-house
message, in which a staffer at this high-tech PR firm blasted
writer and PR critic Michael Wolff.
</P>
<P>
   Wolff is the author of ``Burn Rate,'' a kiss-and-tell book about
an Internet publishing company he founded in the mid-'90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Burn Rate'' is Wolff's account of how he lost control of his
startup and got screwed by former associates _ like his PR firms.
</P>
<P>
   Writing ``Burn Rate'' apparently wasn't cathartic enough for
Wolff, now a columnist for the Industry Standard in San Francisco.
In the magazine's May 4 issue, he took a shorter swipe at PR firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm mad because I didn't get my name in the paper enough''
after spending tens of thousands of dollars on PR fees, Wolff
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   That column provoked one Alexandrian to e-mail her colleagues _
and by accident, me. Wolff's startup stiffed Alexander for $48,869
in unpaid PR fees, she said, to let colleagues ``know the kind of
character we're dealing with here.''
</P>
<P>
   I phoned Wolff, who didn't deny the deadbeat-client claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hire these PR people to get your name in the paper and
they don't,'' he said. ``My position finally was: No ink, no
money.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Political ink: &LR;  Alexander, which wants to be the PR firm that
marries tech to politics, has been helping TechNet bring Republican
lawmakers through Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's guest was Representative Michael Oxley, the Ohio
Republican who will play a key role in passing a bill banning
``frivolous'' lawsuits in state courts.
</P>
<P>
   I asked Oxley why the recent GOP interest in what has been
Clinton-Gore country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might have given up on Hollywood,'' he said. ``All the
Republicans out there are dead. Hell, we lost John Wayne, Frank
Sinatra. But we're not giving up on Silicon Valley. The way they
give out stock options, a lot of these companies are turning
employees into capitalists, big time.''

 `Stealth' Web pages feed off addresses  
 By Jon Swartz   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When a congressional staffer recently went surfing for
information on the White House, what he stumbled across was hardly
presidential.
</P>
<P>
   At the infamous Whitehouse.com Web site, the flummoxed aide
encountered a digitally enhanced caricature of Hillary Rodham
Clinton _ resplendent in black leather and whip _ leading the
president by a dog leash, and a banner cooing, ``Our nation's young
teens, hot lesbians and hardcore nymphomaniacs all gather here to
serve you and serve their country.''
</P>
<P>
   The aide's boss, U.S. Senator Lauch Faircloth, R-N.C., was not
amused.
</P>
<P>
   ``It upsets the senator that children can punch up `White House'
and look at this stuff,'' said Jim Hyland, Faircloth's legislative
director.
</P>
<P>
   The bait and switch (the official Oval Office Internet address
is www.whitehouse.gov) has driven Faircloth to draft legislation
that would put a lid on some ``stealth'' Web sites. It prohibits
private parties from using government agency names for commercial
Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Hyland said the proposal is being crafted as a stand-alone bill
or as an amendment to pending legislation from Indiana Senator Dan
Coats. The latter legislation, which is scheduled for a Senate vote
this month, would require operators of commercial sites ``harmful
to minors'' to put up barriers to prevent access by anyone under
18.
</P>
<P>
   But industry insiders and legal experts say Faircloth's bill _
in whatever form _ is a blatant affront to the First Amendment.
They say the law won't clear up the murky realm of online
trademarks, nor will it arrest an onslaught ofstealth Web sites
that promote everything from adult-oriented businesses to political
parodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many sites with misleading names, (the bill)
would be difficult to enforce,'' said Shyla Welch, a spokeswoman
for Enough is Enough, a Fairfax, Va., nonprofit organization that
supports Coats' bill.
</P>
<P>
   Enterprising Web operators are increasingly invoking the
monikers of government agencies and well-known companies to mask
their content and get extra attention among an estimated 1 million
online sites.
</P>
<P>
   Steamy Web sites have excelled at the digital diversion to reach
a large commercial audience _ and the results can be jolting to
unsuspecting Web surfers.
</P>
<P>
   _Those expecting to get Internet services by typing
www.yahhoo.com instead are getting an eyeful of a nude Pamela Lee
Anderson with breathless promises of ``See Pamela f--- Tommy Lee.''
</P>
<P>
   A Yahoo spokeswoman said the Santa Clara company (real site:
www.yahoo.com) is aware of the sitebut that the firm's lawyers have
not contacted it.
</P>
<P>
   _NASA officials (real site: www.nasa.gov) thought they had rid
themselves of an embarrassing situation when they invoked the
National Space Act of 1958 _ which makes it illegal for a private
group to identify itself as NASA _ to shut down the X-rated site
www.nasa.com last year.
</P>
<P>
   Not entirely. Now there is www.nassa.com, which also features
eye-popping nude photos.
</P>
<P>
   Although Faircloth's bill would ban such misappropriation of
government names, it does not tackle the scores of Web sites that
mask their content with corporate names or well-known phrases. For
example, dumbfounded nerds looking for free shareware software are
surprised to find pornographic images at www.sharware.com.
</P>
<P>
   Faircloth's ire, however, is directed squarely at
Whitehouse.com.
</P>
<P>
   After plunking down $10,000 to buy the rights to
www.whitehouse.com in May 1997, Dan Parisi of Secaucus, N.J.,
started the site as a ``pure parody of U.S. politics,'' but few
cared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was losing $10,000 a month until I discovered how popular
adult sites are,'' Parisi said.
</P>
<P>
   The site's traffic also has surged to 50,000 visitors per day
from just 100 daily a year ago. Even with all those visitors,
Parisi said he's just now breaking even, but he expects to turn a
profit soon.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials aren't amused, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``We object to your use of the names and images of the White
House, the President and the First lady on that Website to sell
memberships in an adult video club,'' presidential counsel Charles
Ruff stated in a curt December 1997 letter. ``We too believe in the
First Amendment _ and in humor, although we see nothing humorous in
your use of the White House domain name to draw children and other
unwitting Internet users to your website.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the warning, the site is still up. It includes the
disclaimer: ``We are in no way endorsed by or associated with the
U.S. government. You must be 18 years or older to enter this
site!''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are plenty of other companies with Web sites that
contain the words `White House,''' Parisi said. ``I have just as
much right to that name as they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Many agree with Parisi that legislation is not the answer.
</P>
<P>
   Industry observers argue that the Clintons are public figures,
making the parody of them _ no matter how distasteful _ legal. And
the site's other content is protected under the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a huge encroachment of free-speech rights,which allow
for parody and conflicting opinions,'' said Wayne Rash, senior
technology editor at InternetWeek magazine in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Trademark lawyers, meanwhile, are divided on whether the White
House should receive the same protections as NASA and Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are federally mandated super trademark protection for
Olympics, Girls Scouts and Daughters of the American Revolution,''
said Carl Oppedahl, an intellectual-property attorney in Frisco,
Colo. ``I'm sure Congress could do the same to White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Sally Abel, a Palo Alto attorney and board member of the
International Trademark Association in New York, said the Internet
industry is trying to ``hash out'' its role in online-naming
rights.She said victims of stealth sites have three options: They
can lobby domain-name dispenser Network Solutions to protect their
trademarked name online, sue the offending party or ``grin and bear
it.''
</P>
<P>
   If legislators don't get their way, they might get an assist
from cybersquatters _ people who register Web addresses that
include the names of companies, celebrities or products, with the
intent of reselling them at a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Parisi and others routinely pay $100 to $1,000 to buy the legal
rights to domain names. Some cybersquatters say they are wary of
being misled into selling their names to hard-core Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will absolutely not sell the rights to `teens.com' so
someone can slap nude photos on a Web site,'' said Martin Turnbull,
a 57-year-old grandfather and domain-name speculator in Colorado
Springs, Colo. ``I'm sick and tired of being abused by those
people.''

RUN FOR YOUR LIVES, VIRTUAL PETS! 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By TOMMY CUMMINGS  
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Godzilla always seems to be fighting someone: King Kong, Mothra,
Bambi, and for the past two weeks, Ferris Bueller ...
</P>
<P>
   Get ready for Godzilla vs. Tamagotchi.
</P>
<P>
   Kristen Brennan of Berkeley, Calif., created a site
(www.jitterbug.com/gvt/gvt.shtml) that pits the high-maintenance
virtual pets against the big lizard in a Shockwave-powered online
battle.
</P>
<P>
   If you've seen the 1969 film short ``Bambi Meets Godzilla,'' in
which Bambi meets a grisly end, then you're prepared for Godzilla
vs. Tamagotchi.
</P>
<P>
   In Brennan's game, tiny cyberpets wander across a screen on a
Tamagotchi egg, mocking players with their cuteness. Players score
points by crushing the digital creatures into a pulp by clicking
buttons that activate Godzilla's foot. The more pets you smash, the
more points you score.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it sounds brutal, but it must be OK, because it was
developed by a former Tamagotchi owner.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan, who is editor of an online humor e-zine called
Jitterbug Fantasia, came up with the game after one of her
Tamagotchi pets died.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the best way to revenge oneself on a Tamagotchi for
breaking your heart?'' Brennan said. ``Obviously, to recruit
Japan's other major export, Godzilla, to crush the little (toy)
into bits.''
</P>
<P>
   Brennan gained notoriety on the Internet after developing Loving
Henry, a Shockwave-powered digital comic book. Using Shockwave,
readers can turn the virtual pages of the online comic book, which
follows a woman's love for her husband, a bug-eyed alien.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to Brennan's Godzilla-Tamagotchi game has been
positive, she said. Apparently, no one seems offended at seeing
cuddly cyberpets smashed like bugs.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, ``kids write that they love the `thumb-candy' aspect of
the game,'' Brennan said. ``Parents write that their kids'
Tamagotchi toys have been driving them crazy, and they're happy to
work out some aggression online.''
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, no one gets hurt _ except for a few cyberpets.

DISNEY SAID TO BE EYEING NET SEARCH SPECIALIST
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Widespread rumors have emerged that Walt Disney
Co., as part of its strategy to compete aggressively on the World
Wide Web, is in talks to make a major investment in Internet search
specialist Excite Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising Age reported this week that Disney is in talks to
buy up to 40 percent of Excite, the second-most-popular search Web
site behind Yahoo! Inc., as part of a plan to make all Disney Web
sites available through an umbrella entry point that could be
called D Guide or Go Online.
</P>
<P>
   Buying 40 percent of Excite would likely cost Disney at least
$800 million. Excite spurned an unsolicited $1.68 billion buyout
bid at $72 a share two weeks ago from Zapata Corp., a Houston-based
fish-meal processor trying to diversify onto the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Disney and Excite officials declined to comment on the Ad Age
report, which was sourced to an unnamed executive familiar with the
discussions. Analyst Abhishek S. Gami of William C. Blair said
speculation about a Disney-Excite alliance have been ``floating''
around Internet chat rooms recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea if the rumors are true but I would never say
never,'' Gami said. ``Excite would represent a great distribution
vehicle if Disney felt the time was right.''
</P>
<P>
   Excite, of Redwood City, currently generates traffic of 40
million pages viewed daily and themes its site in red and yellow,
as opposed to Yahoo's more subdued blue and gray. It offers both
the Excite and WebCrawler search engines and services for
electronic commerce, direct marketing and classified ads.
</P>
<P>
   Deal speculation started after Chairman Michael Eisner announced
in April that Disney wanted to become a ``gatekeeper'' to the Web.
Disney operates several prominent sites, including Disney.com,
Daily Blast subscription service, ESPN Sportzone, ABC.com and
ABCNews.com and recently agreed to buy the two-thirds of Web
publisher Starwave it did not already own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disney has been doing a pretty good job of providing
content,'' Gami said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Excite, it has lost more than $100 million since its 1995
start-up, including a $6 million loss in the 1998 first quarter
that was less than analysts expected. Revenue more than tripled to
$23 million from $7.5 million in the 1997 quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Excite has alliances with America Online, Intuit, Netscape,
Prodigy and Tribune Co. Its stock price hit $91 in April after
Yahoo's first-quarter earnings prompted a surge in Internet stocks
but fell back in recent weeks and closed Wednesday at $55, off
$1.125.

HUMORIST RETURNS TO COMPUTER GAMES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Leave it to Douglas Adams, the author of ``The
Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,'' to turn interstellar disaster
into a good time, returning to computer gaming after 13 years with
the release of the three-CD interactive adventure Starship Titanic.
</P>
<P>
   The sumptuously produced game is a hoot of the first order, a
warped hybrid of Myst and Monty Python in space, aided and abetted
by ex-Pythonite Terry Jones, who provides the goofy voices of many
of the starship's daft robotic characters and one hysterically
squawky parrot.
</P>
<P>
   The premise is that the starship, on its maiden voyage as the
universe's greatest space liner, crashes into your house. You are
begged to come on board and fix things by Fentible, the butlerlike
Doorbot.
</P>
<P>
   Fentible also mentions that though the starship is supposed to
be the galaxy's grandest ride, it is in fact the worst incarnation
of Murphy's Law currently cruising the stars. You seek ree
upgrades to first class, and try to save the liner, without going
slightly bonkers.
</P>
<P>
   The new game marks a return to computer gaming for Adams, who
had a hand in one of the best-selling adventure games of all time,
the text-only 1985 Infocom title based on his ``Hitchhiker'' book.
</P>
<P>
   In the years since that game came out, CD-ROMs have replaced
floppy disks as the medium of choice, allowing developers the room
to create gorgeous graphics and sound. But the knock-out look of
many games has often overwhelmed the stories they contain, Adams
said.
</P>
<P>
   So when he went to work on a new computer game, as part of a
London company he co-founded called the Digital Village, Adams said
he focused on creating a new set of interactive story lines, rather
than recycling the linear narrative of one of his many books.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very conscious of recalling into this medium some of the
complex interaction between author and player that was
characteristic of the early adventure games, but which got lost
when the medium progressed technologically and more attention
focused on the graphics,'' said Adams.
</P>
<P>
   The game's goofy humor will regularly transport fans of Adams
and Jones into Extended Guffaw Mode, while its game play is complex
enough to challenge the kinds of exploration-minded folks who have
made Myst and its sequel such huge sellers.
</P>
<P>
   For a quick taste of the game's humor, check out its Web site on
the Internet, which echoes Adams' tone and seems to have virtually
nothing to do with marketing the game itself.
</P>
<P>
   Located at www.starshiptitanic.com, it purports to be the
in-house publication of Starlight Travel, whose Starlight Lines
include the Titanic. It's a lot of fun, though you won't directly
learn much more about the game itself.
</P>
<P>
   You are eventually asked, however, to give your e-mail address
as part of a series of goofy ``personal'' questions mocking the
kinds of data other Web sites routinely gather from their readers.
</P>
<P>
   Publisher Simon &AMP; Schuster Interactive is counting on a
Myst-like market reaction, with its biggest-ever initial release of
200,000 copies to be shipped to 13 countries. Alas, the game has
only been released in Windows 95 format, though its sleek graphics
and liquid movement would look lovely on a Macintosh.
</P>
<P>
   It's that time of year again, when people seem to be graduating
from school or celebrating Father's Day all over the place. If you
haven't the time for a trip to the card shop, there are plenty of
online ways to show you care.
</P>
<P>
   One place to look is Blue Mountain Arts' site, which sends off
animated, musical e-mail greetings for free. Fill in the blanks,
and ship them to the one you love. The site, at
www.bluemountain.com, includes 18 different cards for those wired
young grads, and 15 more for Father's Day. Look out, Hallmark.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of the foul-mouthed cable cartoon hit ``South Park'' can
get their fill of video and audio clips from the show, along with
stills, schedules and other goodies related to the thrill-seeking
third-grade menaces at www.comedycentral.com/southpark/
</P>
<P>
   Tell 'em Kenny sent ya, before he was killed. Again.

FTC TO PROPOSE LAWS TO PROTECT CHILDREN ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By AMY HARMON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amid mounting public concern about the abuse of personal data in
an increasingly digital world, the Federal Trade Commission is
expected to censure the Internet industry Wednesday in a report to
Congress for doing virtually nothing to insure adequate consumer
privacy protection online.
</P>
<P>
   In a departure from the Clinton administration's hands-off
approach to the Internet, the agency will call for legislation that
would require sites on the World Wide Web to obtain parental
consent before collecting personal information from children,
according to the report. The FTC said it would make recommendations
on privacy for other Web users this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children are told by parents not to talk to strangers whom
they meet on the street, but they are given a contrary message by
Web sites that encourage them to interact with strangers in their
homes via the Web,'' the report says.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., said, ``This is a historic
benchmark that changes forever the discussion of the protections
which children need in a cyberera.''
</P>
<P>
   In a study of 1,400 Web sites in March, the FTC found that 85
percent collect personal information but only 14 percent provide
any notice about what they do with the data. Only 2 percent provide
such notice with a comprehensive privacy policy, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those numbers are frightening,'' he said. ``If privacy
protections are not built into Internet commerce, then a vast
majority of Americans will never trust the Internet.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although few had seen the long-anticipated report Wednesday,
news leaks about it added fuel to a heated debate among industry
leaders and privacy advocates about how to address privacy
concerns. Several companies and trade associations rushed to blunt
the effect of the report with announcements of new policies.
</P>
<P>
   Technology trade groups representing more than 10,000 companies
sent President Clinton a letter asking for a chance to allow
self-regulation work.
</P>
<P>
   And the Direct Marketing Association touted its own study, which
showed that 70 percent of the top 100 children's Web sites publish
a privacy policy. The group, which has lobbied against legislation,
said late Wednesday that it had adopted a new policy to seek
parental consent for online marketing involving children younger
than 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is business stepping up to the plate, moving in the
direction that it needs to, and that is how self-regulation
works,'' said Connie Heatley, senior vice president of the
association.
</P>
<P>
   For many companies trying to do business on the Internet, the
entire promise of the medium rests on the ease with which it allows
the collection of information for focusing advertising and
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Based on forms that consumers fill out when they first visit a
site, or on simply tracking which areas of a site they visit most
frequently, Web site owners can, for example, determine which
advertisements to show them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's not customized and personalized, it might as well be
television,'' said David Card, a senior analyst at Jupiter
Communications, an online consulting operation in New York. ``I'm
nervous that we'll get stuck with a law that would eliminate the
technical ability to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, consumers have continually expressed fears about what
happens to information that they provide in cyberspace. Anxiety
about the use of of medical and financial information online is one
of the top reasons people do not use the Internet, according to
several recent polls.
</P>
<P>
   And some companies have decided that electronic commerce would
be more helped than hurt by ending such practices.
</P>
<P>
   America Online, which has been much-criticized for privacy
lapses, said Wednesday that it would not use the information that
it gathers about what members do online for any marketing purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This can be extremely valuable information in the
marketplace,'' said Jill Lesser, AOL's deputy director for law and
public policy. ``The ability to target consumers is extremely
valuable. But you have to strike a balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lesser added: ``It's hard to fault the FTC for calling a
spade a spade. Hopefully this will be a catalyst for companies to
look at privacy protection as a business imperative.''
</P>
<P>
   But government action is needed, privacy advocates said, because
children have never been more more vulnerable to commercial
exploitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're creating a new children's culture, and if we don't set
ground rules for how that's done, we could see a whole set of very
egregious, manipulative practices that could do a lot of harm to
kids,'' said Kathryn C. Montgomery, president of the Center for
Media Education, a child advocacy group. ``And this new culture
could turn toxic.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem with many sites aimed at children is that they make
divulging information seem like a game, Ms. Montgomery said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Popsicle Web site, published by the Good
Humor-Breyers Ice Cream unit of Unilever, asks children to choose
whether they want to be commanders or passengers. Just one catch:
Commanders have to fill out their age, sex, favorite TV show and
favorite popsicle before blasting off.
</P>
<P>
   And in case anyone was inclined to just go along for the ride,
the passenger option cautions, ``Sure, you can ride in the big
stuffed chair, but you'll miss out on the chance to win free
Popsicles. Plus it's really cold in outer space without a
Spaceship. Why not be a commander?''
</P>
<P>
   Popsicle's privacy policy says that it does not release the data
it gathers to third parties.

BELL ATLANTIC ANNOUNCES COMING FAST INTERNET HOOKUPS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic will bring high-speed Internet access to several
major East Coast cities by the end of the summer. But Boston and
New York will have to wait until next year.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic joins the roster of Baby Bell regional phone
companies that are rolling out Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line
service, or ADSL, a technology that enables standard copper phone
wires to carry vast amounts of digital data as well as regular
voice telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bell Atlantic is determined to keep pace with people's
evolving needs by adding booster rockets to the on-line connections
we provide,'' said Bell Atlantic retail group president Bruce
Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts say the Internet cannot become a mass medium until
it is easily accessible by consumers from their homes. Even with
the fastest modems available today, cruising the Internet from home
can be a slow and frustrating experience, especially when sites
include video or complicated graphics.
</P>
<P>
   Communications companies are experimenting with several methods
to make connecting to the Web faster. In addition to ADSL, these
include cable modems, which operate through cable television
networks, and ISDN, or integrated services digital network, a phone
technology that provides high-speed data as well as voice services.
</P>
<P>
   The lowest-priced version of the new InfoSpeed service will
deliver up to 640,000 bits of data per second, a rate 12 times
faster than today's fastest modems. The user will also be able to
transmit data at 90,000 bits per second. This version of the
service will cost $69.95 a month.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; if,,.1l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic will also offer two more expensive options, with
data reception speeds of 1.6 million or 7.1 million bits per
second. These InfoSpeed services will carry monthly charges of
$109.95 and $189.95, respectively, and are aimed at telecommuters
and self-employed people with home offices.
</P>
<P>
   The InfoSpeed system will work with PC and Macintosh computers,
but Bell Atlantic's own Internet service is currently available
only to PC users. However, the company will also offer InfoSpeed
through other Internet providers. Customers who obtain the service
through some other provider will receive a substantial discount
from the standard price.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic plans to charge less than $200 for installation of
the system. But company spokesman Larry Plumb wasn't sure whether
that will include installation of a high-speed data networking card
in the customer's computer.
</P>
<P>
   The price will include installation of an ADSL modem and a
special device called a ``splitter'' that will allow data and voice
traffic to flow over a regular home phone line. A consortium of
computer and telephone companies are completing work on a
``splitterless'' version of ADSL that should be much cheaper to
install, but Bell Atlantic officials said they wanted to enter the
market as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The deployment of the new service reflects the legacy of last
year's merger of Bell Atlantic and Nynex Corp., which formerly
served New York and Boston. InfoSpeed will be rolled out first on
Bell Atlantic's old turf, with deployment in Washington, D.C.,
Philadelphia, and Pittsburgh in September. The Hudson River area of
New Jersey will get the service in October. But New York City and
Boston are set to go on line some time next year.
</P>
<P>
   Plumb said personnel in the former Nynex areas aren't as
familiar with ADSL systems as those in Bell Atlantic's old
territory. Besides, Plumb said, Washington is the nation's
second-biggest user of Internet services, after California's
Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Doyle, vice president of International Data Corp. in
Framingham, is skeptical that there's a mass market for ADSL
services. His organization has predicted that only about 1 million
households will subscribe to such services by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle noted most residential Internet users pay about $20 a
month. He said if they're asked to pay $70, ``a pretty decent
percentage of the people are going to drop off.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, ADSL suffers from a crucial limitation. It only
works for people who live within 18,000 feet of a telephone company
central office _ roughly three miles. Bell Atlantic officials have
estimated that about 60 percent of their local lines will be able
to use ADSL.

ADVERTISING: INTERNET AD DEALS PICK UP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By COURTNEY KANE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The pace of deals involving interactive advertising accelerated
Wednesday as three acquisitions and affiliations were announced.
</P>
<P>
   In one deal, 24/7 Media Inc. in New York acquired Cliqnow Sales
Group, the Internet advertising sales representation division of K2
Design Inc. in New York, for $1 million in cash and $3 million in
convertible preferred stock of 24/7.
</P>
<P>
   Cliqnow, which K2 started in 1996, has 10 employees who handle
ad sales for 75 Web sites including those of The Associated Press,
PR Newswire and the Women's Forum. Cliqnow will operate as an
autonomous unit of 24/7 with sales staffs in Chicago, Los Angeles,
New York and San Francisco, and the Cliqnow sub-networks, offering
computer users content on topics like finance and travel, will
operate separately from the 24/7 network.
</P>
<P>
   Though Cliqnow has been successful, said Matthew de Ganon,
president at K2, ``we need to focus specifically on our core
interactive advertising and media business.'' The sale, he added,
would enable K2 to concentrate on that ``and pursue aggressive
growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Paternoster, 32, president at Cliqnow, and Joe Apprendi,
31, executive vice president, will continue in those roles and also
become senior vice presidents at 24/7.
</P>
<P>
   The second deal involved Double Click Inc. in New York, an
interactive advertising network, and Ad Knowledge in Palo Alto,
Calif., which provides tools for Internet media planning and buying
and campaign management. The two companies have formed a strategic
partnership; financial terms were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the affiliation is to integrate the technologies of
the two companies to create standard industry platforms for Web ad
management that would help make buying and selling online
advertising more efficient and effective. Ad Knowledge will now
focus primarily on operations intended to help advertisers and
agencies buy ads on the Internet while Double Click will support
the Ad Knowledge operations focused on selling ads on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, customers of Click Wise, the Ad Knowledge Web site
ad management software, will now be about to use the Double Click
DART service, a proprietary technology offering ad server,
reporting and tracking abilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the online ad industry continues to expand, there is
significant benefit to creating uniform standards for site
publishers and advertising agencies,'' said Kevin O'Connor,
chairman and chief executive at Double Click. ``With the
standardization that this partnership represents, we believe that
online advertising will improve industry-wide. And, by
consolidating our efforts with Ad Knowledge, we believe we can
expand DART's reach and market penetration.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Kauffman, president and chief exective at Ad Knowledge
said, ``We believe DART provides the best solution for Web site
publishers and we are confident our Click Wise customers will
benefit tremendously from the power of Double Click advanced
technology.'' Both Kauffman, 41, and O'Connor, 37, will continue in
their respective roles.
</P>
<P>
   The third deal involved Interactive8, an online marketing agency
in New York, which acquired Tuckett/Parshall Interactive in New
York, a specialist in interactive advertising aimed at black
consumers. Financial terms were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Tuckett/Parshall, which will be renamed as the TPI division of
Interactive8, has estimated billings of $500,000 from clients like
Essence magazine, Motown Records and Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter &AMP;
Co. TPI will be headed by Lawrence Tuckett, 43, founder and partner
at Tuckett/Parshall, who also becomes creative director, and
Michael Waite, 30, partner, who becomes executive producer.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition ``puts us at the forefront of urban online
marketing and will greatly benefit companies expanding into the
African-American consumer demographic,'' said Bill Markel, partner
at Interactive8. Interactive8 has 37 employees and estimated
billings of $4.9 million from clients like AT&AMP;T Corp., the Citibank
unit of Citicorp and the M&AMP;M/Mars unit of Mars Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The quickening pace of deal-making in cyberspace is echoing the
frenzied deal-making among traditional agencies as well as
reflecting how the dynamics of interactive advertising and
marketing are changing rapidly as the industry grows.
</P>
<P>
   Other Internet-related deals in the last month included two
acquisitions by Agency.com in New York; the purchase of Digital
Cafe, a digital media agency in St. Paul, by Campbell Mithun Esty
in Minneapolis, which is majority owned by the Interpublic Group;
the acquisition of Circle Interactive in Boston by Arnold
Communications, a unit of Snyder Communications in Boston, and the
expansion of the online career services of TMP Worldwide in New
York through the purchase of two Web sites, About Work and Student
Center, from Ivillage in New York for $1.7 million in cash.

WHAT WILL THE INTERNET CHANGE NEXT? TRY THE TELEPHONE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Never mind about Web browsers. Right now the most interesting
Internet action involves that little computer terminal you use to
order pizza.
</P>
<P>
   Your telephone. It has been part of a computer network since the
1960s, when the old Bell System began swapping its mechanical phone
switches for computerized one. But this is one computer network
that hasn't been redesigned for the era of the Internet, until now.
Suddenly, we're seeing companies offering long-distance calls over
the 'Net for 8 cents a minute or less.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the old pipe dream of using desktop computers to
place ``free'' calls. Those calls were worth the price, with
tin-can acoustics and long pauses between words. But now the
techniques for sending voices over the Internet have gotten good
enough to shake up the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Take a look at Qwest Inc. of Denver. This firm has laid over
5,400 miles of fiber-optic cable along railroad rights of way. It's
Qwest's own private network, using the same software standards run
on the public 'Net. But Qwest uses its system to carry
long-distance calls for residents of nine cities, including Los
Angeles, San Francisco, Denver, and Salt Lake City. The price _ 7
1/2 cents a minute, every day, all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Did I mention that you don't need a computer? Any phone will do.
Just dial an access number, your password, and the number you want
to call.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's IDT Corp., a little Internet provider in
Hackensack, N.J. It's peddling long-distance phone calls over the
Internet at 8 cents a minute. I tried it on a call to my niece in
Chicago. The voice quality was sub-AT&AMP;T, and I certainly wouldn't
have heard a pin drop. But it was quite adequate for a
how's-the-old-neighborhood chat.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the Internet is forcing a major industry to rethink
its way of doing business. And this time the rethink is rooted in
the fundamental design of phone networks.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Bell's day, phones have been based on circuit
switching. That's an engineer's way of saying when you make a phone
call, one electrical circuit is entirely tied up by your chat, even
when you're just doing heavy breathing. Quite a waste of bandwidth.
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet, all communications are diced into small blocks
of digital data, called packets, and a transmission uses only as
much of the line's capacity as it needs to send those packets. That
way you can shovel a lot more data down the wire.
</P>
<P>
   The phone companies have caught on. By using Internet-style
packet switching instead of circuit switching, they get maximum use
and profit out of their networks, even at lower prices. They'll
have to tear out their old-style switches, but they can continue to
use their existing wires. Besides, nearly all the growth in
telephone use is coming from data transmissions, anyway. So phone
companies build packet-switched systems to handle this extra
traffic, while they gradually retire the older circuit-switched
system.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry-watchers once thought Internet phoning would
terrorize the established phone companies. Instead, they're falling
in love with the idea. AT&AMP;T has launched its own trials of
Internet-based telephone service right here in Boston. And on
Tuesday, Sprint announced a dramatic overhaul of its entire
network, featuring an advanced packet-switching method called ATM.
In a few years, the Sprint network will use exactly the same
processes to transmit Grandma's phone calls and her e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   One reason Internet phoning is so cheap is that it's not subject
to special fees that traditional phone companies must pay to
maintain phone services in poorer areas. The FCC has said this tax
break will vanish once Internet-based phoning takes off. So
Internet calls aren't going to get much cheaper; there may even be
some price increases.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with today's technology, any company with a nationwide
data network can become a long-distance phone company almost
overnight. That means plenty of competition to keep prices down.
And since the Internet covers the world, these companies are also
driving down the cost of international calling.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a day when calls to Tokyo and Toledo cost pretty much
the same. Makes the browser wars seem trivial, doesn't it?

POWERDESK UTILITY HAS FILE VIEWER, MULTIPLE DESKTOPS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN  
c.1998 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Remember PC Tools for Windows? The file manager had a viewer
so you could toggle through files in many formats and see the
contents, then open, copy or delete. There was no waiting, and no
programs were launched for viewing. What current program offers the
same features for Windows 95?
</P>
<P>
   A: Ah, PC Tools! I haven't heard or read those words in a long
time _ too long.
</P>
<P>
   PC Tools, from Central Point Software, was easily the best
Windows 3.1 and MS-DOS utility of its day. It competed with
Symantec's Norton Utilities, until Symantec bought Central Point
Software and discontinued the line.
</P>
<P>
   PC Tools for Windows had two great features _ an option that let
you set up multiple desktops, and a file manager that let you
instantly view a data file. Those technologies found their way into
an early Windows 95 product, Norton Navigator. But that product had
a lot of problems, most notably the fact that it bogged down even
the most powerful of computers. Norton Navigator has since been
discontinued.
</P>
<P>
   However, there is a product that's similar to PC Tools for
Windows. Mijenix's PowerDesk Utilities 98 has a lot of the same
features, including a file manager with a built-in file viewer. It
also includes the multi-desktop feature found on PC Tools. Best of
all, it won't bog down your system.
</P>
<P>
   PowerDesk Utilities began its life about the same time as Norton
Navigator, as an early Windows 95 product from a company called
MicroHelp. That's the same company that developed UnInstaller, the
original third-party uninstall program for Windows. Mijenix now
owns PowerDesk and has done an excellent job of tweaking and tuning
it.
</P>
<P>

www.mijenix.com/powerdesk98.htm.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently learned how to build Web pages, and I've put
together a nice little home page for myself. Now I want to put it
up on the Internet, but I'm kind of at a loss. How do I do this?
I'm on America Online _ do I need to switch to a different provider
to make my Web page available?
</P>
<P>
   A: One of the best-kept secrets about America Online is that the
service gives each subscriber two megabytes of server space per
screen name for a personal home page. Since AOL allows you to have
up to five screen names, you could command as much as 10 megabytes
of server space!
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, you don't have to switch just to post a home page.
</P>
<P>
   You can post your Web site several ways. If you do a keyword MY
PLACE, you'll find an area that lets you post Web pages you've
created on your own. You can upload the files here, one at a time,
until you've delivered all your graphics and pages to the server.
</P>
<P>
   But AOL also has an area called Personal Publisher (use that as
your keyword), which automates the process of building a Web site
by using a template. If you're a novice, this is the place for you.
You don't need to know anything about Hypertext Markup Language, or
HTML, the code in which Web pages are written. Building your own
page is as simple as filling in a form.
</P>
<P>
   Once you upload your page, it's located either at the
members.aol.com or the home.aol.com server _ the system will tell
you where. You can then point your friends to the site by telling
them to look at the name of the server, followed by a slash and
your screen name. For example, if your screen name is JoeSmith and
your page was on the members.aol.com server, your site's address
would be members.aol.com/joesmith.

RIVEN TO DESPAIR BY THE GOLDEN DOME
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY  
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I've been stuck at the same place in Riven for
almost a month. How do I get into the golden dome?
</P>
<P>
   _ Frustrated
</P>
<P>
   DEAR FRUS: Just follow the fine example set by presidents, major
corporations, millions of taxpayers and my last six wives: Cheat
your rear end off.
</P>
<P>
   OK, maybe you have that pride thing going, but get a grip. Are
you going to spend the next two years of your bleak little life
staring slack-jawed and red-eyed at a cruelly mocking computer
screen, coming up with even more and more improbable, incorrect
solutions to your little quandary? Or are you going to rejoin us
here on Earth? It's just a game! You lost!
</P>
<P>
   By the way, I've been inside the dome. Nothing there but more
impossible-to-solve puzzles that will drive you crazy and your wife
to a divorce lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   You've given it a fair shot. It's time to take it like a French
soldier and run up the white flag. Fortunately, for cheats and cads
like us, there is a whole subculture of gamers more than willing to
help.
</P>
<P>
   From the instant a new game hits the shelves, it's as if there's
a contest to see who can finish it first and post the solution on
the Internet. Sure, the game manufacturers may try to bleed another
20 bucks out of you for an official hint book, but you can get the
same stuff for free if you know where to surf.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, try doing a Yahoo! or Excite search with this
phrase: ``Riven and cheat or walkthrough.'' You'll discover entire
Web sites devoted to cheating your way through life. Second, if
you're still foolishly clinging to that bizarre concept of honesty
and morality, try checking out news groups, those bulletin boards
of badinage, banter and bull. Subscribe to some of the gaming
groups. You'll find ones devoted to Riven and Myst, its
predecessor. Here, you can trade hints back and forth, and you only
have to spoil as much of the thrill of conquest as you need to
maintain your sanity.
</P>
<P>
   And, last, if you were so worried about ethics, you wouldn't
have claimed your computer room as home office space on your tax
return, especially not since you just admitted to the whole world
that all you do is play games there. Don't worry, the IRS doesn't
read this column. Well, not very often, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I use the Internet regularly, although just to
access Web sites. I never use chat rooms, etc. Do I need anti-virus
software?
</P>
<P>
   _ Mr. Clean
</P>
<P>
   DEAR CLEAN: Venturing anywhere on the Internet without a virus
scanner is as dangerous as using a bus-station toilet. There are
just too many acne-faced, prepubertal dweebs with no life who think
that messing with your computer makes them elite hackers instead of
pitiful wastes of skin.
</P>
<P>
   Go to www.tucows.com and check out the wide selection of
scanners. Some are shareware, others are trial versions, but please
snag something. Look for one that monitors your system continually
and automatically checks new files you download. It's not just
programs you have to watch out for, though. The little geeks have
even found ways to spread their electronic mayhem though
word-processing documents and Web page coding.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if you're reading this column on the Internet without
anti-virus software, you may be susceptible to Bombay Booboo, the
dreaded virus that suddenly causes text on your screen to garble
and krelmar yo radney glitzdorf. .MDBU/.MDNM/ (Noted
computerologist Dr. Emilio Bombay offers occasionally accurate
advice about most things electronic. He can be reached on Internet

PC PEEP SHOW: COUPLES SHED INHIBITIONS, CLOTHES FOR INTERNET
PROFIT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (Eds.: Deletes hometown of Eugene at request of sources; also
deletes extraneous quote. Editing throughout.) 
Editor's note: Web addresses are not included because of the
explicit nature of some of the sites. 
By DWIGHT SILVERMAN  
c.1998 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, the Oregon couple known in cyberspace as Hubby and
Wifey had a little secret _ they liked to take video and still
pictures of each other when they made love.
</P>
<P>
   But their private pastime became public about a year ago when
Hubby, on a lark, posted a Polaroid of a topless Wifey on an
Internet discussion group.
</P>
<P>
   Now they're making money at it.
</P>
<P>
   The couple regularly posts explicit photos in several forums,
and each posting casually mentions that ``videos are available.''
</P>
<P>
   They've been selling a lot of those videos at about $40 to $50
each. They don't want to say how much money they've made, but it's
a large sum _ enough that they worry that revealing it would hurt
their image as earnest amateurs.
</P>
<P>
   Hubby and Wifey _ who don't want their real names used _ are
among hundreds, maybe thousands of individuals who post nude and
sexually explicit images of themselves online.
</P>
<P>
   They aren't professionals. These aren't porn stars or topless
dancers. They are everyday people who like to show off, and like
Hubby and Wifey, some of them are making good money doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Hubby and Wifey, who met in high school, are now both 33 years
old. He owns a distribution business; she's a stay-at-home mom with
three young children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are really just kind of plain-jane plain-Jane people,''
said Wifey. ``If you ever saw us on the street, you wouldn't
recognize us. I look just like a suburban housewife; I'm not very
glamorous.''
</P>
<P>
   These provocative images appear in one of two places.
</P>
<P>
   One is in Usenet news groups, thousands of individual discussion
forums on the Internet, each devoted to a specific topic. Some of
the groups are set up exclusively for the posting of erotic
photographs.
</P>
<P>
   The other area is the World Wide Web, the part of the Internet
that combines graphics, text, sound and video. There, a growing
number of people who don't consider themselves part of the sex
business are setting up Web sites that feature photos of
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Sex on the Web is big business, one of the few on the Internet
to turn a tidy profit. Forrester Research, a Cambridge, Mass.-based
market research firm, estimates that sex Web sites will rake in
$137 million this year, a figure that will jump to $296 million in
2001.
</P>
<P>
   Most of that, said Forrester analyst Seema Williams, ``will come
from smaller players. Big name brands don't mean that much in this
business. The brand name doesn't necessarily dictate the type of
product you are going to be getting.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web is the perfect delivery system for pornography, because
it's very private, said Williams. ``No one is going to see you
walking into an adult video store.''
</P>
<P>
   Pornography on the Net has been largely unregulated since the
U.S. Supreme Court last year struck down as unconstitutional the
Communications Decency Act. That law, crafted as part of
telecommunications reform in 1996, made it illegal to place
``indecent'' material on the Web in a way that it could be
regularly accessible to minors. Since the ruling, several
replacement bills have begun making their way through the
legislative process.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of pornographic material on the Internet raises
tempers on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough issue, because it's a free speech issue,'' said
Steven Carr, general manager for Clearsail Communications, a
Houston-based Internet service provider that filters out
pornographic Web sites and news groups on behalf of its customers.
</P>
<P>
   But Carr, like many who oppose pornography on the Web, said its
open availability is just morally wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The Web is where the money is made, but it is Usenet where most
of the amateurs begin. Much like Wifey and Hubby, it is usually
through an expression of exhibitionism that generates positive
feedback.
</P>
<P>
   Wifey, who happily admits to an exhibitionist streak, wasn't
upset when Hubby first posted those topless Polaroids. And she was
particularly gratified at the e-mail that poured in from people
wanting more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were getting 100 to 200 e-mails every day,'' said Hubby.
``It became a kind of game for us _ let's try to guess how many
e-mails we have today.''
</P>
<P>
   Hubby and Wifey gladly obliged and gave the regulars in the
Usenet news groups what they wanted _ extremely explicit photos of
the couple having sex, including still pictures from a high-quality
video camera.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, the couple began offering to sell videotapes,
and orders began pouring in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main issue right now is time,'' said Hubby. ``It takes a
lot of time to process all these orders, box up the videos and take
them to the post office.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's worth it financially _ enough that the couple has paid
an experienced Web site design firm to create Wifey's World, which
will be used to sell their videos in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Web site, we can take credit cards _ that should cut
back on the amount of time we have to spend processing orders,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The couple speculate that one of the reasons their pictures and
videos are so popular is that ``people are turned on by the fact
that we are monogamous,'' Wifey said. ``I'm madly in love with my
husband, and it shows.''
</P>
<P>
   Danni Ashe, former topless dancer and soft-core porn film star,
was one of the first professionals to launch a sex Web site back in
1995. Danni's Hard Drive has grown dramatically from the days when
she was designing the site herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, I have 17 employees,'' she said. ``We made $3 million
last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Another popular venue for online exhibitionists are Web-cams _
live video cameras that show either the intimate details of
someone's life or planned strip shows.
</P>
<P>
   Billy DaMota, a Hollywood casting director, maintains a
tongue-in-cheek directory on the Web of sites that feature women
who take their clothes off in front of a Web-cam and charge money
for it. Customers pay a monthly fee to have access to the cams,
enticed by a free area up front that shows past scenes.
</P>
<P>
   DaMota said his listing began as a parody of another site, but
he soon began getting requests from women who wanted him to include
them on his pages.
</P>
<P>
   DaMota said there are now businesses that set up shop and hire a
stable of women to pose for Web-cams. ``They take half the girls'
money,'' he said, ``just like pimps.''
</P>
<P>
   For many amateurs who want to show off, the Internet is a kind
of safe underground where they can do so without being seen by the
mainstream _ including their relatives, friends and neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   A Maine man who goes by the online name of F1guru began posting
pictures of his girlfriend Tobi late last year. The first shots
were ``very plain _ bathing suits and workout stuff,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tobi didn't know about it, but soon found out,'' F1guru said
in an e-mail interview. ``She was positive, but apprehensive at the
same time. I convinced her to let me post a topless picture after
getting a lot of mail asking for more.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobi became an online sensation, with Usenet regulars clamoring
for more. The couple set up a Web site earlier this year, charging
visitors $14.95 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``In two months, we made a couple thousand dollars,'' he said.
``We got about 3,200 hits a day.'' Hits represent people viewing
their Web site.
</P>
<P>
   But then, a boyfriend of Tobi's cousin spotted her pictures on
Usenet. Her cousin then told the rest of Tobi's family, who accused
F1guru of taking advantage of her.
</P>
<P>
   After her family confronted her, Tobi asked that the site be
taken down.
</P>
<P>
   Hubby and Wifey keep their Internet activities away from their
children. And Wifey worries that her religious parents will find
out. If that happens, she said, her days of flaunting it on the Net
will likely be over.

   ``That's what bothers me about this _ the children,'' said Carr

if she's in the grocery store one day with her kids and someone
recognizes her and says, `Hey, I know you!'''

 FTC Seeks Online Privacy Law for Children  
 By Jon Swartz   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Web surfers _ especially children _ have little privacy
protection on the Internet, and Congress should step in to shield
minors, the Federal Trade Commission said in a scathing report
issued yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, part of an exhaustive three-year investigation,
are based on a poll of 1,400 Web sites. Of those monitored, 85
percent collected personal information from surfers, but only 14
percent informed customers how they use it. The five-member
commission said children were more likely than adults to volunteer
information on Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are disappointed with the Internet industry's attempts to
self-regulate its basic fair information practices,'' FTC
commissioner Mozelle Thompson said in an interview. ``In most
cases, data was collected silently and then dispersed over the
World Wide Web almost instantly. This isn't like losing a credit
card in a restaurant.''
</P>
<P>
   The FTC report confirms the worst fears of privacy advocates,
who claim the Internet is overrun with sites that ask users to fill
out electronic questionnaires with their names, home and e-mail
addresses, phone numbers and credit-card numbers and then peddle
this information to marketing companies.
</P>
<P>
   Among the survey's findings:
</P>
<P>
   _More than 90 percent of the commercial Web sites polled collect
personal data, but only 2 percent have a comprehensive policy on
how to use it.
</P>
<P>
   _Nine out of 10 sites aimed at children seek personal
information about visitors, yet only 23 percent advise kids to get
parental permission.
</P>
<P>
   _Of the 100 most popular Web sites, 97 percent glean personal
data. However, 71 percent of those sites have policies about what
to do with information they gather.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC is urging Congress to draft a bill that would require
Web sites to get parental consent before collecting information
from those under 13.
</P>
<P>
   The commission also may propose new regulations in the coming
months regarding broader issues of privacy on the Internet, FTC
Chairman Robert Pitofsky said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For every AOL, IBM or other online service that has a
legitimate privacy policy, there are thousands who don't,'' the
FTC's Thompson said. ``I find that extremely troubling.''
</P>
<P>
   The report is a searing indictment of the administration's
year-old policy urging Web sites to ensure privacy by disclosing
how personal data would be used and disseminated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It underscores the Clinton administration's failed policy of
letting Internet companies police privacy themselves,'' said Jeff
Chester, executive director of the nonprofit Center for Media
Education in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Ari Schwartz, policy analyst at the civil liberties group Center
for Democracy and Technology in Washington, D.C., said the sheer
size and scope of the Internet make it necessary for the FTC and
Congress to ``set some baseline standards to separate the bad
actors from the good actors.''
</P>
<P>
   In a last-minute attempt to stave off legislation, industry
leaders are scrambling to form self-regulating bodies that would
address privacy concerns.
</P>
<P>
   This week, a dozen trade groups _ led by the Business Software
Alliance and Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association _
adopted privacy standards to give individuals the choice to ``opt
out'' of data collection.
</P>
<P>
   Former FTC Commissioner Christine Varney and AOL chief executive
Steve Case also are in the process of shepherding organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the FTC report, industry leaders contend that online
shopping is a relatively safe proposition. The leading
electronic-commerce sites have detailed privacy policies against
circulating consumers' personal data without permission, the report
found.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are five to seven times more likely to have your privacy
invaded offline. There are few instances of identity theft,'' said
Susan Scott, executive director of the nonprofit group TRUSTe in
Palo Alto. The company has a privacy-notification seal that is used
by 135 e-commerce sites, including Disney, America Online and
Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to foster trust in order to create consumer
confidence,'' Scott said.

FTC WARNS THAT INTERNET OFTEN MAKES SURFERS GIVE UP PRIVACY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission warned yesterday that getting onto
the Internet can often mean giving up your right to privacy and
urged Congress to establish protections for children, who the
agency said were especially vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   After visiting 1,400 of the most popular Web sites, the agency
found that the great majority requested personal information from
visitors _ names, addresses, phone numbers, and sometimes even
Social Security numbers and medical information. But there are no
legal restrictions on how companies can use this data, and the FTC
said most companies don't even bother to tell consumers how their
personal information will be used.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of on-line businesses have yet to adopt even
the most fundamental fair information practice,'' the agency said
in a report issued in Washington yesterday. And many of the sites
that offer no privacy protection solicit personal information from
children.
</P>
<P>
   The study's results have led the FTC to abandon its previous
policy that self-regulation by Internet-based businesses would be
sufficient to protect the privacy rights of citizens. Instead, the
agency is calling for a new federal law to strictly limit the
ability of Internet businesses to collect personal information from
children. And the agency held open the possibility that it might
request additional privacy protections for adults as well.
</P>
<P>
   The report dismayed business groups, which fear new federal
regulations that would make doing business on the Internet more
difficult and costly. The Direct Marketing Association, which
represents many businesses with Internet sites, said that
self-regulation efforts are finally beginning to work, and stated
its opposition to Internet privacy laws covering adults or
children.
</P>
<P>
   The association's senior vice president, Connie Heatley, cited a
study from the association that found that 70 percent of the most
popular children's Web sites have written privacy policies. ``We
think that there has been progress made, that organizations have
clearly responded to the FTC's challenge,'' Heatley said.
</P>
<P>
   But US Representative Ed Markey said the study proves the need
for an Internet privacy bill of rights. The Massachusetts Democrat
said Internet companies have shown little interest in regulating
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been addressing the Direct Marketing Association on this
issue for the past four years,'' he said. ``This survey makes it
quite clear that a very high percentage of direct marketers have
not heard the message.''
</P>
<P>
   Markey said he introduced legislation last summer to protect the
privacy of Internet users, but the House had taken no action on the
measure.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pitofsky, chairman of the FTC, said that despite the
report's disappointing findings, he would not call the industry's
efforts at self-regulation a failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``This report is not meant to signal by us or perhaps by others
that there is no hope for industry self-regulation,
</P>
<P>
   he said. ``It's pretty clear that more incentives are necessary
to get industry to engage in what they thought they could
accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC study was conducted in March. It found that:
</P>
<P>
   More than 85 percent of the sites surveyed requested personal
information from visitors. But only 14 percent told the visitors
how that information would be used.
</P>
<P>
   89 percent of the sites aimed at children asked for personal
information. Of these, only 54 percent provided any privacy
information to children and parents.
</P>
<P>
   More than three-quarters of the sites didn't ask children to get
a parent's permission before providing data.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than 10 percent gave parents the right to restrict the use
of information about their children.
</P>
<P>
   The report calls for legislation that would require Internet
sites aimed at children to get the permission of a parent before
seeking information from children. Parents would also be guaranteed
the right to limit the use of such information.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC didn't recommend new laws to govern the use of personal
information collected from adults, but the agency left open the
possibility. It promised a set of recommendations on this issue
later this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic Privacy Information
Center in Washington, said the results of the survey call into
question the Clinton administration's hands-off approach to the
Internet. ``My view is that the White House, and the FTC to some
extent, backed themselves into a corner by saying that they wanted
to take a broad-based self-regulating approach to the Internet,''
Rotenberg said. ``Things like privacy protection do require
government action.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rotenberg said the FTC report doesn't go far enough. He
noted that many Internet sites force users to provide information
about themselves if they want to make use of the site. Rotenberg
favors a law that would require Web sites to grant access to
visitors who wish to remain anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Steinhardt, president of the Electronic Frontier
Foundation, an Internet civil liberties group, also had a problem
with the FTC report. Steinhardt said the legislation might prevent
minors from communicating over the Internet with organizations
offering advice on gay rights, birth control, and abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe that minors should be required to get their
parents' permission to visit Web sites that contain health or
reproductive information,'' said Steinhardt.

SELF-REGULATION OF INTERNET COMPANIES IS POOR, SAYS FTC 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Civil liberties advocates and children's groups
urged the White House on Thursday to abandon its hands-off stance
to Internet privacy regulation after a Federal Trade Commission
report painted a dismal picture of the effectiveness of companies'
self-regulation, especially in regard to children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that the Clinton administration policy has been an
abysmal failure,'' said Jeff Chester of the Center for Media
Education, an electronic media public-interest group based in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   After the FTC report was released Thursday morning, the agency's
chairman, Robert Pitofsky, called its conclusions ``disappointing''
but declined to call self-regulation a failure. ``I still believe
that the best way to deal with this is self-regulation rather than
heavy-handed government,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC, which surveyed 1,400 Web sites in March, found that a
year after the agency had warned businesses of the need to adopt
strong privacy guidelines to avoid government regulation, 92
percent of all Web sites collected personal information from users
and only 14 percent of those sites disclosed how that information
was used.
</P>
<P>
   Most troubling to the FTC was the finding that 89 percent of the
children's sites surveyed collected personal information. Of those,
only 23 percent told children to seek parental permission, 7
percent said they would notify parents of their
information-gathering practices, and less than 10 percent provided
for parental control over the collection and use of the
information.
</P>
<P>
   At one Web site, the agency said, children were asked to give
their names, addresses, e-mail addresses, ages and whether they
ever received gifts of stocks, cash, savings bonds or certificates
of deposit.
</P>
<P>
   Some sites gave away candy for providing an e-mail address.
Others used games, surveys and popular animated characters to
persuade children to give their names, e-mail addresses and other
information.
</P>
<P>
   Also troubling, the report said, was the amount of data
collected by interactive public areas like chat rooms, which are
accessible to everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``These activities enable children to communicate freely with
strangers, including adults,'' the report said. Investigation by
the FBI and Justice Department, it said, ``has revealed that online
services and bulletin boards are quickly becoming the most powerful
resources used by predators to identify and contact children.''
</P>
<P>
   The report recommends that Congress pass legislation to require
that Web sites collecting personal information from children
younger than 12 notify parents and obtain consent to collect the
information. The FTC, Pitofsky said, will continue to evaluate the
broader issues of Internet privacy and make recommendations later
this year on whether protections are needed for adults.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Berman, executive director of the Center for Democracy and
Technology, an online advocacy group, called on the FTC to ask
Congress for authority to immediately adopt rules to protect
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Punting this issue to Congress without taking this first step
may result in a political nightmare for the Internet community,
with controls on content and moves to a national identification
scheme for the Net,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic Privacy Information
Center, said the FTC report failed to address all of the critical
issues. ``We wanted to see them make a clear statement on the need
for protecting the anonymity of people on the Internet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rotenberg, however, said he was not concerned about Congress
taking on the issue. ``Part of the problem is that the FTC has been
holding on to the ball and not letting people run with it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who really need to do something are the people in
the White House,'' Rotenberg said. He said Ira Magaziner, Clinton's
Internet adviser, had been ``traveling the world telling everyone
that self-regulation works. The message is clear: self-regulation
has not worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Magaziner was traveling on Thursday and could not immediately be
reached for comment. But Commerce Secretary William Daley was
critical of the progress made by industry to police itself.
</P>
<P>
   Daley said he and other officials had warned the industry that
it must move more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has to be a critical mass of the companies to make
self-regulation work, and we haven't seen that yet,'' Daley said.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department is supposed to make a full report to the
White House in July on whether self-regulation is working. Business
groups insist it is and are pleading for more time to prove that.
</P>
<P>
   The Direct Marketing Association, for example, has endorsed
privacy policies similar to those recommended by the FTC and is
working to educate businesses of the need to follow the guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   The association said its own survey in May of the top 100
children's Web sites showed that 70 percent posted privacy polices,
compared with 38 percent in January.

<P>
   DeLorme's AAA Map'n'Go 4.0 has a new interface and offers users
the American Automobile Association's popular TourBook travel
listings on its latest CD-ROM trip-planning software.
</P>
<P>
   The new version (Windows; about $35-$40) goes beyond being just
another program that picks the route and spits out maps. It has
some interesting features not found in other programs.
</P>
<P>
   For those with 3Com's popular PalmPilot handheld computer, the
program allows users to send directions from the software directly
to the PalmPilot. It also allows users to place photographs on a
map _ a handy feature if you want to indicate landmarks for turning
points.
</P>
<P>
   It is also compatible with DeLorme's
global-positioning-by-satellite receiver, which can be hooked to a
laptop computer. The program's GPS voice navigation feature lets
the software ``speak'' the directions and alert the driver to
upcoming turns.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a scanner or digital camera, the program's ``slide
show'' program can be used to assemble favorite pictures into an
album that is displayed on the computer screen in slide-show
fashion. The production can include text and audio, and the
finished product can be printed out or e-mailed to friends.
</P>
<P>
   The program uses updated AAA travel information with listings
for more than 68,000 lodges, restaurants, campgrounds and
attractions.
</P>
<P>
   Parents might appreciate a section of kids' travel activities
and games.

SCHWAB LAUNCHES NEW CHINESE-LANGUAGE SITE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By LAURA CASTANEDA 
  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. has become the first U.S. brokerage to
provide Internet trading in a foreign language by introducing a
Chinese-language site.
</P>
<P>
   The site, at www.schwab.com/chinese, is Schwab's latest effort
in a longtime strategy to build its Asian American clientele by
providing bilingual brokers, materials and telephone services.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese site also may lead to more multilingual Web sites in
the future, said Wallace Louie, Schwab's director of Asia Pacific
Services in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are long-term international implications as we become
more of a global economy,'' he said, adding that Schwab is working
on a Spanish-language investing site as well.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Schwab began offering 24-hour telephone service in
Mandarin, Cantonese, Vietnamese, Japanese and some other Asian
languages to help customers trade securities.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Schwab introduced Telebroker, an automated
telephone service, in Mandarin and Cantonese.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab also has opened five branches nationwide, including two
in the Bay Area, to cater to Asian Americans by providing bilingual
brokers and materials.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab's Asian-language branches are located in San Francisco's
Chinatown, Milpitas, the Los Angeles suburbs of Rowland Heights and
San Gabriel, and Flushing, N.Y. There are plans to open new
branches in Daly City and Seattle later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Other financial companies are trying to catch up with Schwab.
Merrill Lynch has Asian-language offices in New York and the Los
Angeles area. PaineWebber Inc. also has an office in Flushing that
focuses on Asian Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity Investments has launched a pilot program to try and
target Asian American investors by providing bilingual brokers over
the telephone and at some investor centers across the western
United States, including San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese-speaking customers can get quotes, check their account
balances and make trades on Schwab's new Web site, which also has
several links to the company's English-language site.
</P>
<P>
   The site is being promoted by Schwab's Asian investment centers,
and by ads in Chinese media. But the most effective marketing tool
will be satisfied customers, Louie said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of financial decisions are made by the entire family,
and there's a lot of word-of-mouth, especially compared to the
general market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many Asian American investors already do business in English,
but Schwab wanted to provide as many options possible to make
investing less stressful, Louie said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people have been here a few years but would prefer to
speak to someone in their native language. They want to be sure
there's no miscommunication,'' he said.

COMPETITORS TAKE AIM AT CICSO SYSTEMS

Tom Steinert-Threlkeld is the editor in chief of Inter(AT)ctive
Week, an industry publication covering the Internet and
communications network technology. 
 By TOM STEINERT-THRELKELD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For most of the last decade, Cisco Systems Inc. has been
steamrolling competitors in data networking. Its routers and
switches dominate the Internet and corporate networks that try to
get disparate sorts of computers to talk to each other.
</P>
<P>
   It holds a 70 percent market share in routers and related
products, and the company's $79.3 billion value in the stock market
is more than four times the combined stock market value of its main
rivals: 3Com Corp., Bay Networks Inc. and Cabletron Systems Inc.
</P>
<P>
   But lately, Cisco is on a collision course with a set of new,
much bigger competitors. Companies that have made their livelihoods
selling gear to the telephone industries are intent on moving into
Cisco's market.
</P>
<P>
   These companies contend that their long experience in running
dedicated-circuit voice networks gives them an edge over Cisco,
which has specialized in sending data as packets distributed over a
variety of pathways between routers, the traffic controllers of the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent of these new rivals are Lucent Technologies,
the spinoff of AT&AMP;T Corp. that includes Bell Labs, and Northern
Telecom of Canada, Lucent's chief competitor in the supply of
conventional switches and other equipment for telephone networks.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do they have the heft _ Lucent has three times the
annual revenue of Cisco _ but they also have the motivation. They
realize that the market for the equipment they have been selling,
which relies on setting up dedicated paths, or circuits, for each
communication, is quickly becoming doomed.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, this dedicated-circuit approach, known as circuit
switching, seems destined to be replaced by more efficient and
economical packet-switching technology on which the Internet (and
Cisco's business) is based.
</P>
<P>
   Packet switching, originally intended for transmitting data, was
once thought to be too crude for voice communications. But
increased communications capacity and improvements in the way the
technology can organize the packets are beginning to make it
possible to use packet switching even for ``continuous flow''
information like voice conversations and even video programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at a technology flash point where there is no longer a
question that data is the dominant architecture and voice is a
service,'' said Cisco's executive vice president, Don Listwin.
</P>
<P>
   To overcome Cisco's leadership in data networking, Lucent and
Northern Telecom will be counting on their ability to transfer the
characteristics of voice network technology to data networks.
</P>
<P>
   They will tout the ``extra level of engineering'' that goes into
the more complicated networks that carry voice traffic, as David
Ramos, Nortel's vice president for marketing, likes to put it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no one silver bullet,'' said Bill O'Shea, president of
Lucent's data networking business. ``It's years and years of
experience, building systems and watching how they operate'' that
insure reliability and avoid failures.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Lucent and Nortel are still very much newcomers. Only this
month will Lucent begin testing its first billion-bits-a-second
packet switch based on Internet protocols, which could become a
true competitor to Cisco's most advanced gear.
</P>
<P>
   Northern Telecom, for its part, derived only $785 million of its
$15.4 billion in revenue last year from data networking; it has a
long way to go to be on an equal footing with Cisco.
</P>
<P>
   But then, in this transition from the old world architecture of
circuit switching to the new world of packet switching, it is not
altogether certain that Cisco plans to slug it out with Nortel and
Lucent.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco's chairman, John Chambers reportedly broke off intensive
talks with Lucent about some sort of partnership because the two
companies' product lines had begun to overlap too closely. Now, he
is said to be bent on concluding an alliance with Nortel, which
could take advantage of its strengths in sales and service in the
telephone industry.
</P>
<P>
   But the impulse to form new data networking alliances is not
Cisco's alone. Last week, the data-switch maker Tellabs announced
plans to acquire Ciena Corp., a high-flying supplier of a new
technology that vastly expands the capacity of fiber backbones, for
$7.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   And a day later, another digital switch maker, DSC
Communications, agreed to be acquired for $4.4 billion in stock by
Alcatel Alsthom of France _ a telecommunications equipment giant
that wants to expand its American presence.
</P>
<P>
   So Cisco may find it increasingly difficult to steamroll the
competition. Last week, when Sprint announced plans for its
national network to evolve from circuit switching to packet
switching, attention centered on the fact that the key new pieces
of equipment for chopping voice, video and other data into
fixed-size packets would come from Cisco, and not from a
telecommunications vendor like Lucent.
</P>
<P>
   But Cisco's gear, when ready, will only be found on the edge of
this new- era network. At its core will be data switches from the
Japanese giant NEC _ and, oh yes, from Nortel.

CABLE, INTERNET GAINING AS NEWS SOURCE FOR AMERICANS, SURVEY

<P>
   Following a pattern seen in entertainment viewing, Americans now
watch news programs on cable television networks about as regularly
as those on broadcast networks, according to a survey by the Pew
Research Center for the People and the Press.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers also found that the number of people who get
their news from the Internet is rising rapidly and they estimated
that almost as many people use the Internet on a typical weekday as
spend time reading a magazine.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 percent of American adults, or an estimated 36 million
people, get news from the Internet at least once a week, the survey
found, compared with 6 percent, or about 11 million, two years ago,
when Pew conducted a similar survey. Those who use the Internet for
news are disproportionately younger, better educated and more
affluent, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
   As for television, more than half of those surveyed said they
watch the news with a remote control in their hands, poised to
change the channel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a quixotic audience,'' said Andrew Kohut, director of the
Washington-based Pew research group. ``Post-Cold War, people say
local news is much more important to them than national or
international news. We found that in the survey and in focus groups
afterward, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of Americans who watch the network evening news
and local news only on broadcast television has fallen to 15
percent, from 30 percent five years ago, according to the telephone
survey of 3,002 adults conducted April 24 to May 11.
</P>
<P>
   In the survey done two years ago, Kohut said, ``We found all
news viewership going down, but this time the slide is limited to
broadcast networks and to a certain extent CNN.''
</P>
<P>
   Fully 40 percent of Americans said they regularly watched one of
the leading cable news networks (CNN, CNBC, MSNBC or Fox News
Channel), while 57 percent said they watched the major broadcast
networks' morning, evening and prime-time news programs regularly.
When the Weather Channel and ESPN's Sports Center program are
added, the cable figure grows to 60 percent, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
   These responses may seem inconsistent with Nielsen ratings,
which show most cable news networks getting minuscule ratings.
Gregory Flemming, one of the survey's directors, said this was
because Nielsen measures actual viewership by program or time
period, while the survey's tally of viewers who say they watch
``regularly'' might include people who watch only one show a day
(but almost every day) or people who tune in for a few minutes
several times a day.
</P>
<P>
   Only 38 percent described themselves as regular viewers of the
ABC, CBS or NBC evening news broadcasts, compared with 60 percent
five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   An obvious advantage for the cable news networks is that they
have news around the clock, unlike the broadcast networks. Most
Americans said they would turn to cable channels first if a big
news event broke. Indeed, 46 percent of Americans surveyed said
they only follow national news when a major event is occurring, and
67 percent said that is the only time they follow international
news.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The survey found the average American spends an hour a day
absorbing news _ whether from television, radio or newspapers _ but
the amount of time varies widely with age. Older people watch and
read more news than younger people.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, young people are the most likely to go online to
get news, and even though they pursue news less often, large
numbers of young people said they enjoyed having the wide variety
of choice in news sources that is available today.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate Pew survey about the credibility of news
organizations, conducted May 7-13 among 981 adults, CNN ranked
highest in ``believability'' among broadcast and cable television
sources, with CBS's ``60 Minutes'' second. The syndicated tabloid
television show ``Inside Edition'' ranked lowest, with National
Public Radio second lowest.
</P>
<P>
   The survey broke down respondents by age, income and whether
they were occasional, moderate or frequent news viewers.

for Research on the People and the Press, 1150 18th Street, NW,

SMALL COMPANY ENCROACHES ON MICROSOFT'S SPACE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A tiny company in Seattle is introducing a technology on Monday
that industry analysts say could loosen Microsoft Corp.'s firm grip
on the valuable real estate of personal-computer screens.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft sets the rules for how the main screens, or desktops,
are used, because its Windows operating system has a near-monopoly
in the personal-computer market. Personal-computer makers are
permitted to put icons for starting software programs on the main
Windows screen, but only within the Windows environment and in
compliance with contract restrictions imposed by Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The company's contract restraints on what PC makers can do with
the Windows desktop are a key element in the antitrust suit filed
by the government against Microsoft last month. The Justice
Department and the 20 states that also sued the company argue that
the restrictions represent an abuse of Microsoft's market power.
Microsoft replies that its contracts protect the integrity and
uniformity of Windows, and thus benefit consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle start-up, Pixel Co., has a software innovation that
is essentially an attempt to grab a slender band of the computer
screen, just beyond the desktop and outside Microsoft's contract
rules. It does this by occupying some unused screen space, called
the overscan area, about \-inch to {-inch along each edge of the
screen.
</P>
<P>
   Pixel's product is a control bar called My Space that sits on
the bottom edge of the screen, just below the Windows 95 task bar.
By clicking on a My Space icon, a user can link to a site on the
Internet's World Wide Web, control hardware like a CD player, or
start software programs.
</P>
<P>
   Packard Bell NEC, a large PC maker, plans to begin installing
Pixel's software in its computers for the home market later this
month, said Mal Ransom, a senior vice president at Packard Bell.
``This should allow us to have a more interactive relationship with
our customers, enabling us to connect them to any place we want to
take them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pixel says it is also talking to other PC makers.
</P>
<P>
   Online information and commerce sites have signed agreements
with Pixel to obtain prime placement of their icons on the My Space
control bar, the company said. These include bookseller Amazon.com,
ESPN, ABC News and Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   Pixel would collect revenue both from license deals with PC
makers and from fees paid by Web-site operators. Such arrangements
would give computer companies and Web programmers prime places on
the My Space bar, but the bar can also be customized by individual
users _ adding or removing icons, or deleting the bar altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts who have seen Pixel's software are impressed.
``Instead of just complaining about Microsoft's control of the
screen, this company has figured out a way around the problem,''
said Rob Enderle, an analyst for Giga Information Group, a research
firm. ``This could be a technology with legs.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Computers are generally shipped with the slender bands of unused
screen space partly to ensure that if the monitor is jostled in
transit, none of the display is obscured. But many companies,
schools and stores set up personal computers so that Windows
occupies the entire screen, including the overscan area.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Pixel's business plan rests on the assumption that the
overscan area is open real estate _ outside Microsoft's direct
control.
</P>
<P>
   Pixel's managers and legal adviser are experienced in dealing
with Microsoft. Pixel is a unit of Ark Interface II, a computer
interface designer that until recently was a wholly owned
subsidiary of Packard Bell NEC.
</P>
<P>
   Ark had developed a ``shell'' program for Packard Bell in 1994,
called Navigator, that ran on top of Windows 3.1 and tried to make
computers easier to use. Last month, Packard Bell NEC sold Ark to a
group of investors, including Pixel's management team.
</P>
<P>
   Pixel, its managers say, was born of a sense of frustration with
Microsoft's contract restrictions. ``The contracts changed every
year, and 15 months ago they really closed up,'' said Tom O'Rourke,
the president of Pixel. ``That forced us to think outside the box _
at least outside the Windows desktop.''
</P>
<P>
   The technical challenge of devising a way to use the overscan
space fell to David Nason, Pixel's vice president of research, a
computer scientist who formerly worked for Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Pixel filed a patent application for its technology last
November, and the patent approval process typically takes 18 months
or so.
</P>
<P>
   Pixel's legal adviser is Robert Steinberg, a partner at Irell &AMP;
Manella in Los Angeles. Steinberg is an intellectual-property
expert who wrote the patent for data-compression technology that
became the center of a legal dispute between Microsoft and Stac
Electronics Inc., which Steinberg represented.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, a jury ordered Microsoft to pay Stac $120 million for
patent infringement. Microsoft appealed but settled the case for an
estimated $50 million and took a 15 percent stake in Stac.
</P>
<P>
   Pixel's patent application, Steinberg said, is intended to
``protect the visual real estate'' of the overscan area.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real question here is whether Microsoft is going to
challenge this and claim that even the overscan area belongs to
Microsoft,'' said Steinberg. ``If it does, that would represent an
aggressive expansion of its desktop, pushing others aside at a time
when it faces a major antitrust case.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Microsoft said the company had not yet seen
the Pixel software, and could not comment on it.

ANALYSTS DIVIDED ON FUTURE OF BATTERED SEMICONDUCTOR STOCKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When bad things happen to good companies, many investors start
looking for buying opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the case with semiconductor stocks, which have been
battered this year as one formerly stellar company after another
has reported earnings disappointments, layoffs and product delays.
Chip industry analysts agree that the group may be reaching a
bottom, but they differ on when to start buying chip stocks again.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the bad news just keeps on coming. Intel Corp. is
expected to be served with an antitrust suit Monday by the Federal
Trade Commission; late last month the company announced that its
Merced chip would be delayed. Motorola announced last week that it
would cut 15,000 jobs, citing weak demand for cellular phones,
pagers and other products using its semiconductors. And National
Semiconductor warned that revenue would fall below analysts'
estimates, and that it expected to report a loss for its fiscal
fourth quarter, ending May 31, and possibly for the first quarter
of the new year as well.
</P>
<P>
   While some companies face problems of their own making, like
Motorola missing the shift from analog to digital cellular phones,
there are two bigger forces depressing the group as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   First is a glut of personal computers being sold in the United
States, created largely by Compaq Computer Corp.'s need to reduce
inventory as it moves to a build-to-order business model.
</P>
<P>
   Second is the financial and economic crisis in Asia, which has
weakened demand both for personal computers and for all kinds of
devices that use chips.
</P>
<P>
   Because no one in the industry saw either the glut of PCs or the
Asian trouble coming, chip makers kept building production well
into 1997. With supply exceeding demand, prices have plummeted for
semiconductor products from microprocessors to memory chips.
</P>
<P>
   The personal computer oversupply and the Asia crisis are
presumably temporary, but deciding whether and when to invest in
chip stocks is difficult without a clearer end in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Edelstone, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, said that chip
makers had already cut back substantially on new production,
particularly in Asia, and that the PC inventory problems were well
past the halfway point.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will actually see the demand rate for semiconductors
bounce back,'' he said. ``I think that will begin to happen in the
next 60 days.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, many semiconductor stocks are trading at or near their
52-week lows, Edelstone said, because the companies' first-quarter
earnings were a ``disaster, with two-thirds of companies below
estimates,'' and their financial performances are likely to be the
same in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got stocks that are pretty beaten up, and from a
long-term point of view, attractive at current valuations,'' he
said. ``Investors should be getting their shopping lists
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Edelstone is currently recommending Neomagic, a maker of
graphics-control chips for notebook computers; Rambus, a maker of
fast memory devices; Xilinx Inc., a maker of programmable logic
devices, and Intel, which he believes will be little affected by
the FTC suit or the Merced delay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect them to be strong in the second half,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Drew Peck, an analyst with Cowen &AMP; Co., said that it was too
early to begin buying most chip stocks _ that Asia remained an
open-ended situation and that the oversupply of PCs was still a
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be very easy to say it's got to get better pretty
soon, but so far the data that would support such a conclusion are
scarce,'' he said. ``I believe it will happen, but that's only
blind faith. Having said all that, I think we're going to get a
rash of pre-announcements like Motorola's, if not as big, over the
next few weeks. At that point most of the bad news will be
discounted, and even if it takes a year to get a recovery, most of
the risk will be removed.''
</P>
<P>
   Even now, Peck said he recommended some chip stocks that he
thought had been unfairly battered. Among them, he likes Analog
Devices, which makes chips for processing graphics, sound and other
nondigital signals, and Amcor, which makes semiconductor packaging
material. For the bulk of the semiconductor stocks, Peck said the
time to buy had not yet arrived.
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, by the time it becomes apparent that the worst
is over, prices will most likely have gone up. Michael Murphy,
editor of the California Technology Stock Letter, said he started
buying chip stocks last week. ``I think we're going to go into a
pretty different environment in the second half of the year, where
prices will firm up,'' he said. ``We started buying Intel when it
went below $75 and took it to 5 percent of our portfolio when it
went below $70.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy is also recommending LSI Logic, Integrated Device
Technology, Altera, Atmel and Xilinx. ``I think you can pretty much
buy anything in the semiconductor area,'' he said.

NEW INTERNET JOB SEARCH SERVICE FOR MID-LEVEL MANAGERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For many companies, recruiting executives is like looking for
needles in a haystack. The Wall Street Journal and Korn/Ferry
International, a leading executive search firm, hope to use the
Internet to get the needles to emerge on their own.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies plan to announce Monday a national rollout of
``Futurestep,'' a service that seeks to recruit midlevel managers
via the Web and match them with prospective employers. There is a
second high-technology twist: Futurestep automates the cumbersome
recruiting process by using software designed to match a person's
skills and interests with job types.
</P>
<P>
   The service is free to prospective employees, who fill out a
questionnaire at www.futurestep.com, listing background and job
interests. The software then grades the responses; it is capable of
determining what job and corporate culture an employee best fits,
said Man Jit Singh, the chief executive of Futurestep.
</P>
<P>
   Prospective employers who have submitted job openings to
Futurestep will receive a list of potential candidates selected
from the data base _ along with a videotaped interview of the top
prospects. If a company hires a candidate, it pays Futurestep 30
percent of the first year's cash salary, a standard executive
recruiting fee.
</P>
<P>
   The concept is aimed at reducing the time it takes to find
midlevel managers _ who typically make between $75,000 and $200,000
_ and thus make the process cost effective, said Michael Boxberger,
chief executive of Korn/Ferry.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, The Wall Street Journal, a unit of Dow Jones &AMP;
Co., hopes to capitalize on the success of its executive recruiting
classified advertising, which presently is the single largest
classified category in the print version of The Journal, said Mike
Wilson, the company's director of classified advertising. The
Journal plans to make Futurestep a component of its Wall Street
Journal Interactive Edition career site, www.careers.wsj.com.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal will also seek to entice its print-based advertisers
to participate. The advertisers can put the Futurestep Web address
on their advertisements then have Futurestep sort incoming resumes.

 Changing Your E-Mail `Reply To' Address  
 By David Einstein   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  Apparently my e-mail arrives at its destination with a
``reply to'' address that is not my e-mail address. Instead it is
the address of my e-mail server. How can I get rid of it? I use
Outlook Express.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  Outlook Express, Netscape Communicator and other e-mail
programs let you designate two return addresses in messages you
send: your regular e-mail address and a reply address. Ordinarily,
the two addresses will be the same. But a separate reply address
can come in handy if, for instance, you send someone a message from
work but you want the response sent to your personal e-mail account
at home (or vice versa).
</P>
<P>
   Use the following steps to change the reply address in Outlook
Express: Choose Accounts from the Tools menu, select your account
and click Properties. Tab to General, where you'll see a space in
which to enter a reply address. That's the place to enter a
separate address other than your regular e-mail address. If you
want both your addresses to be the same, leave the Reply space
blank.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  When I am on my home PC, how can I access my office PC via
modem? I have a Pentium with Win95.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  There are several software programs that should do the job
for you, including pcANYWHERE from Symantec ($149) and LapLink from
Traveling Software ($124.95). Both programs can connect via modem,
local-area network or the Internet. Using a modem is the easiest
way to go, because all you have to do is load the software on your
PCs at home and at work. If you only plan to connect to your office
PC occasionally, consider Traveling Software's Remote DeskLink
($49.99). It offers many of the features of LapLink, although you
can't transfer files with it.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to go through your corporate network, make sure: A)
it's OK with the company; and B) they're able to configure the
network or intranet server so you can access your office PC.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  In one of your columns you gave directions for blocking the
download of cookies for Microsoft Internet Explorer and Netscape
Navigator, but not for America Online and its browser. Could you
provide this, please?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  Sure. Actually, the procedure is similar to the one for
Microsoft's browser, because AOL uses a version of Internet
Explorer. With the main AOL window open, choose Preferences from
the Members menu, then click the WWW button. Tab over to Advanced,
then scroll down until you get to the cookie options. There are
three: Always accept cookies; Prompt before accepting cookies; and
Disable all cookie use.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, for readers who don't know, cookies are tiny files
that Web sites download to your computer to keep track of
information about you, such as marketing preferences and passwords
for secure sites.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  When I point my mouse at the little monitor icon on the
Taskbar, a bubble pops up giving numbers like (640x480) 256 color.
What does this mean?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  The message you're getting indicates that your display
resolution is 640 by 480 pixels, with 256 possible colors. You
might try increasing your resolution, which should improve the

   &UR; Q: &LR;  Since I installed Netscape Navigator, there is an AOL
Instant Messenger screen that pops up every so often. It's most
annoying and I would love to get rid of it but I can't figure out
how. I'm tempted to just uninstall all of Netscape and go back to
Internet Explorer (horrors!).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  The folks at Netscape suggest this cure: Go to the Netscape
Communicator folder in the Windows Programs menu and choose AOL
Instant Messenger. In the Sign On box that appears, click Setup,
then tab over to Misc. You should see a checked box labeled ``Start
AIM when Windows starts.'' Click the box to remove the check mark,
then click OK. Let me know how it works.

   You can use the keyboard rather than the mouse to quickly move
to another open program or toggle to a different open document in
Windows 95. Suppose you're running Word and Excel at the same time.
Hold down the Control key (Ctrl) and press Tab to move from one to
the other. Similarly, if you have more than one document open in
Word or Excel, the combination of Ctrl + F6 lets you shift between
them.

HAVE BUGS, WILL DELIVER (HELP! HELP!) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (The Science Times)  
 By STEPHEN MANES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Viewpoint Datalabs International Inc. has helped create many
computer-generated models for television and the movies, including
the latest version of ``Godzilla.'' Liveart98, its first product
for the general public, trades the monsters for bugs.
</P>
<P>
   The program costs about $90 and is designed to help users create
clip art by letting them modify three-dimensional models in a
variety of amusing ways. But it refused to work properly on one
computer until I spent hours diagnosing the problems, and on
another it refused to work at all.
</P>
<P>
   Given the list of problems that comes with it, I was unwilling
to give it a chance for a third strike, but apparently I can
consider myself lucky. ``You should have seen the bug list a month
ago,'' said Chris Lowery, the company's director of business
communication.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of exterminating the bugs before they crawled into the
box, Viewpoint chose to grace its Web site
(www.viewpoint.com/liveart/) with a list beginning: ``These are the
known bugs which we couldn't get out at shipping time. Updates will
be made available.'' Is there another industry where people get
away with this?
</P>
<P>
   The known problems include examples that range from ``Right and
Left mouse buttons sometimes gets confused'' to instructions about
what to do ``If you are using a hardware acceleration card and are
experiencing blue screen crashes after working for a while.'' Blue
screen crashes are an especially nasty breed in which the whole
system fails all at once, but I saw not blue but red when Liveart98
locked up my computer to the point where rebooting was required.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots and lots of problems with any new product,''
Lowery said. ``There are certainly a lot of rough edges in the 1.0
package.''
</P>
<P>
   He blamed some of the problems on Microsoft's shortcomings:
``We're intersecting with at least three component technologies
that are not well implemented and not well documented.''
</P>
<P>
   The technologies he referred to are three pieces of leaky
software plumbing known as OLE, DirectX and OpenGL, which Microsoft
includes in Windows 95 and applications. Developing software that
relies on all three is slightly less daring than hiring Moe, Larry
and Curly.
</P>
<P>
   I asked Jeff Prosise, an author and lecturer on Windows
programming, for a reality check. ``If you ask who's at fault,
there's plenty of blame to go around,'' he said. ``Developers are
often guilty of not testing their product adequately, but if
they're working with a technology that's complex and not well
documented, there's only so much they can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's OLE technology, he said, ``is poorly documented and
does not work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every programmer curses it,'' he continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's implemented differently in every application,'' Prosise
said, ``and you can't say one way is correct, because the
documentation is so miserable. OLE is an ugly and ill-conceived
protocol that deserves to die a slow and agonizing death.'' But if
you want your program to appear as a more or less seamless part of
Microsoft Office 97 applications, as Liveart98 can when it works,
OLE is hard to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   DirectX has been a shaky technology since its outset. Designed
to make Windows multimedia applications run faster, it often causes
video problems that can be hard to diagnose and repair, even after
you download and install the latest video driver software to help
insure that the driver is not the culprit.
</P>
<P>
   One such download and some other tweaking finally got Liveart98
working on one of my computers, no thanks to Viewpoint's
documentation or the support technician I contacted. On the other
machine, the program remained intractable no matter what I tried.
Lowery said that only one person in 50 or 60 was having problems
and that the company was working on improvements.
</P>
<P>
   What does Liveart98 deliver if you manage to get it running?
Clip art that looks different from, but not necessarily better
than, the usual breed of graphics that lend church newsletters what
passes for visual spice. The program works on its own or from
within Microsoft Office 97 applications, but it will not rescue the
low repute of clip art or turn a visual incompetent into
Michelangelo.
</P>
<P>
   Your computer renders Live-art98's images from a library of
several thousand three-dimensional models on CD-ROM. A built-in
search engine lets you find possibilities from the broad
collection. When you type ``cat,'' the program cleverly proposes
everything from a feline skull to a Caterpillar tractor and a milk
carton, not to mention a pronghorn antelope and other unrelated
animals.
</P>
<P>
   Customization is the watchword. You can tilt and rotate the 3-D
models on the screen, so you can see a green tiger beetle from
above, from the side or from a worm's-eye view. Combinations of odd
angles and close-ups can make for arresting effects. For further
tweaking, you can render the models in various synthetic drawing
styles, create shadow effects by lighting them from nine different
points, and sometimes change their colors.
</P>
<P>
   In general, heavier stylization and inanimate objects give
better-looking results; more realistic modes give the
oversimplified surfaces of animate objects a disconcerting
artificiality reminiscent of the computer-generated humans in the
film ``Toy Story.''
</P>
<P>
   Rendering 3-D images takes plenty of computing power. If you
were wondering what kind of program might show off a high-powered
machine, this sort of thing is the answer. Viewpoint recommends a
166-megahertz Pentium processor and 48 megabytes of random access
memory, but even a machine of that caliber is likely to seem
lethargic. On the 400-megahertz computer that was able to run the
program, performance was fairly snappy, even though I had to turn
the video card 3-D acceleration off.
</P>
<P>
   Hardware and software makers see 3-D graphics, particularly for
games, as one way to help sell faster, more expensive computers.
But in their effort to improve computers' 3-D performance, they
have lost sight of the one great advantage of game machines and
their software: they just work.

ANALYSIS: A LEAP OF LOGIC TO CLEAR A HURDLE OF FACTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The antitrust laws are designed to protect an industry from
monopolists that use predatory or other illegal tactics to
extinguish rivals. The odd feature of the antitrust complaint
brought Monday by the Federal Trade Commission is that it accused
Intel of victimizing putative rivals that are also customers.
</P>
<P>
   In separate instances involving the Intergraph Corp., the Compaq
Computer Co., and the Digital Equipment Corp., the Intel Corp. is
accused of withholding technical data about its processors from
companies that were designing computers around Intel chips.
</P>
<P>
   What will make the government's case difficult is that only one
of those companies _ Digital _ ever seriously competed with Intel.
What is more, the information that Intel freely acknowledges it
withheld from those companies had no direct bearing on any area in
which they competed with Intel.
</P>
<P>
   The question, antitrust experts agree, is whether the commission
can create a strong factual case for its accusations. Given the
oddity of the charges, that task will not be easy.
</P>
<P>
   Intel controls more than 80 percent of the market for the
microprocessor brains of computers. When it designs a new chip,
Intel gives advance information to its customers _ computer
manufactures _ to give them time to design new machines that will
run the next generation of Intel's processors.
</P>
<P>
   Intel acknowledges that it withheld vital information from
Intergraph, Digital, and Compaq, with which it was engaged in
continuing patent disputes, but it says that it was not about to
share intellectual property with customers that were suing it over
intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
   The company argues that it is not compelled by the antitrust
laws to reveal proprietary information to customers who could
exploit that information in subsequent patent disputes.
</P>
<P>
   The commission says that while the three companies may have
indeed been customers, they were also rivals and that it is illegal
for a monopolist to exploit its market power to force them to cave
into Intel's patent demands.
</P>
<P>
   Intel insists that its hardball tactics were in pursuit of
business objectives that were perfectly legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute with Intergraph, for example, was a negotiation
between buyer and seller. Intel wanted a free license to use
Intergraph's chip technology. Intergraph wanted proprietary
information. Intel asserts that the government has no business
intruding on this negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Shapiro, an economics consultant to Intel from the
University of California at Berkeley, acknowledges that while there
might be areas of rivalry _ Digital, for example, produces a
microprocessor that competes with Intel's Pentium chips in a very
limited market _ but argues that the behavior under challenge by
the commission is overwhelmingly limited to the relationship
between the chip maker and its customers.
</P>
<P>
   William Baer, the director of the trade commission's Bureau of
Competition, says that it is unlawful for monopolists to injure
rivals without an efficiency-enhancing business justification _ for
instance, resulting in lower prices or better products.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Baer says, Intel's decision to punish the three
manufacturers was done only to compel the companies to settle their
patent dispute on Intel's terms.
</P>
<P>
   But to win its case, the commission must show that Intel not
only hurt rivals, if any of the three companies are in fact rivals,
but that it hurt competition within the microchip industry.
</P>
<P>
   That could mean proving that Intel's behavior drove its rivals
into extinction. It could mean showing that Intel's behavior
persuaded rivals to spend less on research and development, thereby
undermining their ability to innovate as fast as Intel. Or it could
mean showing that Intel's behavior convinced actual and potential
chip makers that they could not survive because any computer
company that needed to do business with Intel would be punished if
it also bought chips from Intel's rivals.
</P>
<P>
   In one respect, the trade commission's case mirrors the suit the
Justice Department filed last month against the Microsoft Corp. In
that case, the government pointed to cross-marketing and other
exclusionary contracts between Microsoft and its partners that
would be perfectly legal by nearly any other company. But Justice
Department lawyers argue, with ample precedent, that those same
tactics are illegal when used by a monopolist to shut its rivals
out of a market.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the commission is saying that Intel's refusal to do
business in the midst of a legal dispute would be perfectly legal
in nearly any other context but that the same tactic is not legal
when embraced by a monopolist seeking to drive potential
competitors out of contention.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between the two cases will lie in facts, not
theory. In the Microsoft case, the government is offering evidence
that the software giant's contracts directly affected actual
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The trade commission, on the other hand, may be relegated to
proving a counterfact: that Intel drove away potential competition.
That is a hard case to win, especially when only one of the three
alleged victims was ever a significant competitor in any sense of
the word and all are among Intel's biggest and best customers.

SINKING YEN BEGINS NEW PHASE OF JAPAN'S CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDs: FILED in ``i'' and ``f'' categories.)   News Analysis  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By Bernard D. Kaplan  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The plummeting yen has opened a new phase in the
Japanese crisis, suggesting that even more serious problems lie
ahead for the world's second largest economy, according to
international analysts.
</P>
<P>
   The yen stood this week at 140 to the dollar, a loss of 40
percent in value over the past four years. Although Japan's
currency has been gradually losing strength for many months, recent
losses have been so great that some experts say the decline signals
a wholesale drop in confidence at home and abroad in the country's
entire economic system and its potential for reform.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Japan's exports have remained an outstanding
exception to a flagging economy crippled by inadequate domestic
demand.
</P>
<P>
   But the financial crisis elsewhere in Asia ``has called into
question the continuing demand for Japanese products in key markets
like Indonesia and Hong Kong,'' according to Frank Satsumi, an
international management consultant here. ``The dramatic fall of
the yen reflects these fears.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the sliding yen will make Japanese exports cheaper and
therefore more competitive in North America and some other markets,
most experts agreed that the advantage to Japan will be marginal.
On the other hand, the fall in the yen will make Japanese imports
more expensive and above all will heighten the anxiety of Japan's
consumers over the way their economy is performing.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government expressed alarm Tuesday that the yen's
fall could have a severe impact on China's economy, reducing
Beijing's exports and lessening investment from abroad. China and
Japan are major trading partners, and the Chinese are worried that
Japan's financial problems will lead Tokyo to cut its investments
in Chinese industries considerably.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Tokyo stock market and Japan's financial
institutions continue struggling unsuccessfully to recover. Shares
on the stock exchange represent barely half of their 1990 value
while the banks have done little to overcome a staggering load of
bad debt that may still total $400 billion. In recent months,
Japanese banks have lost $15 billion in Indonesia alone.
</P>
<P>
   The banks' losses and the deflated stock market are linked
because many banks own shares in companies and have seen their
value sharply decline.
</P>
<P>
   One consequence is that Japanese bankers now refuse to provide
even small loans to their country's own enterprises, according to
Margaret Dupre, a financial specialist here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The banks are panicked at the thought of more bad debt,'' she
explained. ``So Japanese firms aren't receiving the financing they
urgently require. Production is stagnating and may grow by less
than 0.3 percent this year. Unemployment was once virtually
nonexistent but is currently more than 4 percent, unprecedentedly
high for Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   The government's successive plans to relaunch the economy have
floundered, boosting the already high degree of political
disillusionment of the average citizen.
</P>
<P>
   Satsumi pointed out that the thrifty Japanese possess an
estimated $8 billion in savings, which government officials would
like to see spent on consumer goods and invested in the stock
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``People refuse to spend,'' he said. ``They don't trust the
government, which they regard as inept and corrupt. They are
holding onto their money.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that Japan's reputation for thrift is only partly
merited. ``The average person saves, but the government is
notoriously profligate,'' he said. ~~``The national debt equals the
annual production of goods and services, making Japan a financially
unstable country.''

 Wintel Showdown  
 By Julia Angwin and Jamie Beckett   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Both halves of the WinTel alliance _ Microsoft and Intel _ now
stand accused of unfair business practices by the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   But the case against chipmaking giant Intel _ brought by the FTC
yesterday _ is much less damaging than the case against software
giant Microsoft, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more on the periphery of Intel's business than the
Microsoft case, which goes to the core of its business,'' said
Nathan Brookwood, an analyst at Dataquest in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Antitrust enforcers at the FTC yesterday accused Intel of
unfairly withholding crucial information about its computer chips
from customers that challenged its patents. Antitrust enforcers at
the Justice Department and 20 states accused Microsoft last month
of unfairly including its Web browser in its leading Windows
operating system software.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, both cases appear to be similar government
actions against high-tech giants. But in fact, they are as
different as the button-down culture at Intel is from the younger,
feistier Microsoft style.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft CEO Bill Gates, 42, responded to the Justice lawsuit
with a nationally broadcast press conference. In strongly worded
remarks, he accused antitrust regulators of ``trying to promote
their ideas of software design ...and trying to punish an American
company that has worked hard.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Intel CEO Craig Barrett, 58, was traveling in Japan
yesterday and had no comment on the FTC lawsuit. Intel Chairman
Andrew Grove, 61, also had no comment. The Santa Clara company's
only official response was a six-paragraph statement from chief
counsel Tom Dunlap that addressed the legal merits of the suit in a
mild tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intel intends to work through the administrative complaint
process and if necessary appeal to a federal court,'' Dunlap said.
``We believe that ultimately that process will conclude that our
actions are lawful.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts said that Intel's understated reaction is also due to
the fact that it doesn't feel very threatened by the narrow scope
of the FTC lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the suit only focuses on information Intel
distributes to its customers rather than broader questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case doesn't go to the heart of the Intel development and
marketing machine,'' said Jack Russo, a high-tech lawyer in Palo
Alto.
</P>
<P>
   The case also is not likely to resonate with the computer-buying
public in the same way as the Microsoft suit. Unlike the unassuming
Barrett, Microsoft chief Gates, the richest man in the country, has
attained a celebrity status. In addition, while almost every
computer user is familiar with Microsoft's software, relatively few
have opened up their machines to tinker with the Intel chip inside.
</P>
<P>
   The Intel case is not generating as much interest among Silicon
Valley consumers and workers as the hotly debated Microsoft case
did.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those interviewed yesterday knew little about the Intel
case. Those who were familiar with the charges were reluctant to
openly criticize their powerful Silicon Valley neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might be applying for a job at Intel someday,'' explained
one engineer, who works for semiconductor equipment-maker Applied
Materials, just a few miles away from Intel.
</P>
<P>
   He and a co-worker were spending their lunch hour browsing
computer superstore T-Zone, a popular Silicon Valley shopping spot.
</P>
<P>
   His companion, also an engineer, said he agrees that Intel has
become too powerful, but hopes the government doesn't come down too
hard because he fears curtailing Intel could hurt the local
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intel does have some unethical practices, but I don't want to
see the FTC put a crimp in the (computer) market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A technology marketer lunching at the Sandwich Construction
delicatessen across the street from Intel declined even to give the
name of his company, which is an Intel customer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intel's our neighbor. They support the economy. They help
maintain property values. They employ thousands of people in the
Valley,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some said they prefer Intel, the home team, to the upstart
outsiders in Redmond.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intel keeps quiet and it knows what it's doing,'' added an
electrical technician whose company sells chip-making chemicals to
Intel. ``Bill Gates does not keep quiet.''

   ``People refuse to spend,'' he said. ``They don't trust the
government, which they regard as inept and corrupt. They are
holding onto their money.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that Japan's reputation for thrift is only partly
merited. ``The average person saves, but the government is
notoriously profligate,'' he said. ~~``The national debt equals the
annual production of goods and services, making Japan a financially
unstable country.''

INTEL'S GO-GO DAYS SEEM OVER, AT LEAST FOR NOW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By KERRY FEHR-SNYDER AND LISA GONDERINGER   
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Intel Corp. faces a triumvirate of troubles: layoffs,
lackluster stock performance and now a government lawsuit that
could define antitrust laws in the digital age.
</P>
<P>
   Are the go-go days of Intel gone-gone, at least for now?
</P>
<P>
   By most indications, yes.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock is down almost $30 since mid-February, it's
earning less money, it was slapped Monday with an antitrust action
by the Federal Trade Commission and it's cutting 3,000 jobs,
including 600 in Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a bad year for Intel,'' said Jeff Weir, spokesman for
the Semiconductor Industry Association. ``They're not all that
different than everyone else in the industry, but they just have
one more example with the FTC action.''
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, few Intel employees say they're worried. They
praise the company for notifying employees early of the layoffs,
which begin in October and come with four months' pay and benefits,
and shrug off the lawsuit as a political poker game.
</P>
<P>
   Weir agrees, saying the problems are nothing new for the plucky
company that maintains an entrepreneurial spirit despite sales of
$25 billion a year and worldwide employment of 64,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're relentless in their style, with their
take-no-prisoners attitude and only-the-paranoid survive
approach,'' he said. ``They've responded to every challenge
historically and thrived through every challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think given that history, anyone's going to assume
that they can't overcome this,'' Weir said.
</P>
<P>
   But from one insider's perspective, there is worry on the part
of Intel's legion of workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``These folks are exceedingly achievement-oriented
individuals,'' said a consultant who trains workers at Intel and
other high-tech employers in the Valley. ``The confidence is a
little bit shattered.''
</P>
<P>
   The old adage was that Intel didn't have customers, it had
hostages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, people are a little bit scared,'' added the consultant,
who is prohibited by the company from talking about Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Fear is not obvious in visits to various haunts around Intel
facilities. Some workers believe they are immune from the cutbacks,
either because their job is needed or their work performance is
superior.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who have lost their jobs are optimistic that they'll
land something else with the state's second-largest private
employer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in software development, and if that's all I could do,
yeah, I'd be nervous,'' said one female worker, who declined to
give her name. ``But there are so many more things, like systems
analysis, et cetera, that I can do.''
</P>
<P>
   But her optimism might be misguided.
</P>
<P>
   The entire semiconductor industry is in a tailspin, due in part
to the Asian economic crisis. The bust is prompting Motorola Inc.,
the state's largest private employer, to slash 15,000 jobs
worldwide, including perhaps 2,000 in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Motorola's shocking news, it was in the process of
closing two product lines, idling more than 400 workers in the
Valley. The communications giant cut 225 positions with the
shutdown of its Advanced Custom Technologies team in Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   Another 180 workers lost jobs at the chip-making factory at 52nd
Street and McDowell Road.
</P>
<P>
   The losses mean Intel engineers will have one less place to find
work.
</P>
<P>
   Even Microchip Technology Inc., a Chandler-based maker of
microcontrollers that has weathered the chip downturn better than
most, isn't looking to employ Intel workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not have any plans to do promotions or target the
employees that are being laid off at Intel,'' said spokesman Eric
Sells.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's woes are exaggerated by factors both inside and outside
the company.
</P>
<P>
   The world's largest chipmaker said May 29 that it will delay its
next-generation microprocessor, Merced, until mid-2000. The chip
had been expected to be released in the second half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The company also faces stiff competition from computer systems
costing less than $1,000, which don't use Intel's latest chip
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Added to that are waning financial results. The Santa Clara,
Calif., company made $1.3 billion in the first quarter, down 36
percent from the same period a year ago. It expects revenue in the
second quarter to be flat or even decrease.
</P>
<P>
   The problems come just months after Intel Chairman Andrew Grove,
a co-founder, relinquished his job as chief executive officer to
Valley resident Craig Barrett. Barrett has been with the company
full time since 1974 and was picked last year as its president.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as having their dirty laundry aired in public through
the lawsuit, it does hurt their public image,'' said Bill McClean,
president of Scottsdale-based IC Insights, a market researcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you (Intel) are truly the only option, it doesn't
really hurt the bottom line.'' &QL;

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Intel Corp. said on Monday that it had lowered
prices on its Pentium II microprocessors for desktop computers by
12 percent to 20 percent. Intel also introduced a faster version of
its low-end Celeron processor and dropped the price of the older,
slower model by 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Intel officials said the price cuts reflected increased
efficiencies in manufacturing processes.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts said the cuts, the first that Intel has made in the
final month of a quarter, more likely reflected an attempt to
revive a sluggish market.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also dismissed the faster Celeron, noting that it still
lacked the memory called cache, which improves performance on
Pentium and equivalent chips from competing companies such as
Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and the Cyrix unit of the National
Semiconductor Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think revenues are coming in below plan to date, and the
company is hoping these price cuts really provide a kick start for
the quarter's end,'' said Jonathan Joseph, an analyst with
Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities. ``Revenues are going to have to
pick up pretty smartly for margins not to be impacted. It's a tough
quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Intel slipped 50 cents on Monday, to $69.3125.
Analysts said the price cuts had been long expected, as was the
antitrust suit filed against Intel on Monday by the Federal Trade
Commission. Intel shares are down 32 percent from their 52-week
high of $102 reached in August.
</P>
<P>
   On another front, the company and Fujitsu Ltd., Japan's largest
computer maker, said that they planned to strengthen their
relationship. People close to the companies said Fujitsu would
announce that it planned to make work stations and servers using
Intel's forthcoming Pentium II Xeon and Merced microprocessors.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In announcing the price cuts, Intel said it had shifted desktop
production exclusively to the Pentium II product line, which is
made using an advanced manufacturing process called .25 micron. But
it said that the older Pentium with MMX Technology chips would
remain in production for notebook computers.
</P>
<P>
   Intel cut the price of its 400-megahertz Pentium II processor
from $824 to $722, or about 12 percent; the 350-megahertz from $621
to $519, or 16 percent; the 333-megahertz from $492 to $412, or 16
percent; the 300-megahertz from $375 to $305, or 19 percent; the
266-megahertz from $246 to $198, or 20 percent, and the
233-megahertz from $198 to $161, or 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The new Celeron 300-megahertz chip is priced at $159; the price
of the 266-megahertz Celeron was lowered to $106, from $155.

FTC FILES ANTITRUST SUIT AGAINST INTEL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Trade Commission filed antitrust
charges Monday against Intel Corp., accusing the company of
threatening and actually injuring three computer manufacturers,
including Compaq Computer Corp., in an attempt to coerce them into
turning over rights to patented technologies.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, Intel is accused of withholding information about
its chips that the computer makers _ Digital Equipment Corp.,
Intergraph Corp. and Compaq _ considered crucial to developing
their own products based on Intel microprocessors. At the same
time, Intel was sharing that information with the three companies'
competitors who were not involved in patent disputes with Intel.
</P>
<P>
   At the core of the government's charges is the assertion that
Intel's pattern of withholding technical data as a weapon in patent
disputes stifles innovation in the microprocessor industry, thereby
enhancing Intel's dominant position.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, approved by a 3-1 vote of the commission Monday
afternoon, serves as a civil indictment of sorts that begins a
complex administrative and legal proceeding that could last several
years.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued Monday afternoon, Intel said the suit was
``based upon a mistaken interpretation of the law and the facts,''
adding, ``The commission apparently questions whether Intel has the
legal right to assert its intellectual property rights as a defense
to an attack on its core microprocessor business.''
</P>
<P>
   While the general outline of the suit has been known for several
days, the addition of Compaq to the list of aggrieved companies
adds a new dimension to the case.
</P>
<P>
   Intel executives and lawyers, in meetings with FTC commissioners
last week, argued that the two other companies mentioned in the
suit, Intergraph Corp. and Digital Equipment Corp., were not
currently major manufacturers of personal computers. As a result,
they said, Intel's withholding of proprietary information could not
have significantly harmed competition in that industry.
</P>
<P>
   But Compaq is the world's largest manufacturer of personal
computers. The government's suit asserts that Compaq sued Packard
Bell Electronics Corp. in 1994, charging that the company was using
patented Compaq technologies in its computers when, in fact, the
components in question had been supplied by Intel.
</P>
<P>
   ``In response to Compaq's assertion of its intellectual property
rights,'' the suit says, ``Intel cut off technical information''
about Intel microprocessors ``that Compaq needed to design systems
based on Intel's newest chips, even though that technical
information was widely available'' to other manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq executives declined to comment Monday, but according to
the suit, Compaq quickly agreed to license the technology to Intel
to end the cut-off of information. As a result, Intel began
supplying the technical information once again, the suit says.
</P>
<P>
   It is that kind of arm-twisting that the government is
particularly intent on stopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Intel can use its monopoly position in the market for
microprocessors to prevent other firms from enforcing their own
patents, other firms will have little incentive to invent new
features to challenge Intel's dominance,'' said William J. Baer,
director of the commission's Bureau of Competition, the office that
prepared the suit.
</P>
<P>
   In its statement Monday, Intel did not directly respond to that
allegation, but it has long asserted its right to give or withhold
information about its microprocessors, the brains of a computer, as
it sees fit.
</P>
<P>
   F. Thomas Dunlap, Intel's vice president and general counsel,
said Monday: ``For years Intel has shared its intellectual property
and early samples of its products with a number of key customers.
These customers work with Intel to develop products for the market
on a mutually beneficial basis. At the same time, for more than 10
years, Intel has taken unprecedented steps to ensure that all of
our activities and policies are in full compliance with existing
law.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Intel executives, in interviews, conceded every factual element
of the case. They differ with the government, however, in asserting
that they had every right to take the actions they took against
Compaq, Digital and Intergraph, and they say that Intel would take
similar actions again if the need arose.
</P>
<P>
   The company says it will argue the case based on the premise
that the government is trying to enforce a new legal theory, that
``because you are successful, the legal rights you had to control
your intellectual property no longer apply,'' said Chuck Mulloy, a
company spokesman. ``What's at work here is a fundamental
disagreement about what the law says. And we think we have 100
years of case law on our side.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunlap added, ``The commission's decision today signals that
they want to change the very laws upon which we've based our
policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Baer, on the other hand, said that the commission was pursuing a
traditional antitrust action. Intel, he said, ``remains free to
bargain with other companies over patent rights and to protect
those rights in court.'' But he added, ``Under the law, Intel is a
monopoly, and it's illegal under antitrust law for a monopolist to
wield its monopolistic power to prevent others from challenging its
dominance.''
</P>
<P>
   In meetings last week, Baer said, Intel executives told the
commissioners: ``All we did was put speed bumps in the way of some
of our competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   In those meetings last week, Intel executives also argued that
their actions had not actually harmed Intergraph or the other
affected companies in any significant way. But in an interview
Monday, Intergraph's chairman, Jim Meadlock, called that idea
``absolutely wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't be on the front end of the marketplace in this
business, then you can't compete,'' Meadlock said. And, he added,
when Intel withheld technical information about upcoming versions
of the Pentium II microprocessors, Intergraph could not design
updated computers as quickly as the company's competitors.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he said, ``we went from first in the work-station
marketplace in 1996 to forth or fifth. For us, this is a very
serious business.''

INTERNETTERS PUT A TWIST IN WEDDING TRADITIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (Charles Stough is an editor at the Dayton (Ohio) Daily News)  
 By CHARLES STOUGH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In June, many young couples turn their attentions to weddings _
the invitations, the decorations, the band, the food, the
bridesmaids, the bar, the federal agents, the cake....
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents? Well, not genuine ones.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents are part of one creative couple's plan. They have
designed a wedding on an X Files theme, after the hit TV series and
coming movie about strange space aliens and even stranger law
enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cerulean blue bridesmaids' dresses, the groom's men in
trenchcoats, masking tape X's on the chapel windows,'' a dreamer
posted in the Usenet newsgroup alt.wedding. It's an Internet site
where people post questions and advice about weddings.
</P>
<P>
   Not marriages. Weddings. They trade chat about marriages over in
soc.couples.
</P>
<P>
   ``Implants in the back of the neck of every member of the
wedding party,'' another contributor chimed in, picking up the
thread.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bridesmaids carry badges instead of bouquets and walk down the
aisle chanting `FBI.' Put the bridesmaids in scrubs and a white lab
coat, hair in a ponytail, tortoiseshell glasses. No bed in the
honeymoon suite, just a couch. The bride's dance with Dad is
`Beyond the Sea.' As favors, give little metal cylinders that have
nasty pointy things spring out when a button is pushed. And of
course the bride walks down the aisle to the haunting, whistled X
Files theme!''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe invitations that look like a subpoena?
</P>
<P>
   Where this wedding is to take place isn't clear. Contributors to
Usenet groups can be anywhere in the world. Probably not a major
place of worship of any mainstream sect. Well, maybe California.
</P>
<P>
   Other typical wedding-interest postings:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I'm looking for some amusement park or county fair type
touches for our reception. We were thinking about cotton candy and
caramel apples for snacks or favors. Any ideas what to put on the
tables?'' Sure, someone replied. Shop hobby shops for model
railroad stuff, like Ferris wheels.
</P>
<P>
   And have a small rubber duck at each place setting, another
contributor suggested, and the one with a star on the bottom takes
the centerpiece home.
</P>
<P>
   _ Is it a good idea in these modern times for the bride and
groom to live together for a while before the wedding? The question
gets asked two or three times a year in alt.wedding, and always
starts a weeks-long argument.
</P>
<P>
   But a recent posting from a bride offered new insight. Yes, she
said, and no only that, they should buy a house first. ``Now, that
was a stress inducing event that tops planning any wedding!'' she
said. ``Not only do you have to test how compatible you are, but
you have to test making compromises for the good of the
relationship, and stick to a rigorous savings plan as a couple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another good test is having to move together. We've moved
together three times. Trying to reach an equitable compromise on
getting rid of whose stuff can start some interesting conversations
as a couple.''
</P>
<P>
   _ How about a gift to give (ital) to (unital) one's parents at
the wedding? One idea is to create a videotape from favorite family
photos. Many photo shops can do it, even adding a touching sound
track.
</P>
<P>
   Alt.wedding postings explore the ways caterers operate, what to
demand from a band or disk jockey, the best man's speech, how to
handle split-family situations, what to do about heavy drinkers _
all the mundane stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Where it becomes most fun is in brainstorming. An X Files
wedding? Some couples would find that a difficult memory to carry
all their lives. But hashing out a wedding theme can cement a
relationship even better than moving a piano into the couple's
third apartment, and with a computer it's much more fun.

Netw(at)atch: She doesn't log on, but 'McBealers' are Web-savvy 
By Frances Katz  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The disturbing news hit the wires late last week. The
24- to 39-year-old age group once dubbed Generation X by author
Douglas Coupland has been renamed by telecommunications company
MCI. MCI has chosen to dub them ``The Ally McBealers'' after the
lovable but neurotic TV lawyer noted for hyper-short skirts and
fantasies about her ex-boyfriend and dancing babies.
</P>
<P>
   Ally McBealers, in their viewing of the Fox show ``Ally
McBeal,'' might have noticed Ally is never shown using a computer.
She's got a laptop, but in all probability she probably spilled
cappuccino on the keyboard one day and now she gets the message
``keyboard error'' every time she tries to log on.
</P>
<P>
   But Ally aside, according to MCI, the McBealers are the most
Web-savvy of any age group. But what Web sites do they have
bookmarked? Here are some likely candidates:
</P>
<P>
   If asked, McBealers would probably say they only read Salon
(http://www .salonmagazine.com) and The New York Times
(http://www.nytimes .com). But in truth, every McBealer worth his
or her salt has surely checked out the online e-zine Swoon
(http://www.swoon.com). The online home of such Conde Nast
magazines as Details, Glamour and Mademoiselle, the site bills
itself as the magazine of ``dating, mating and relating.''
</P>
<P>
   Here, one can peruse items such as Mademoiselle's self-discovery
test called ``What's Your True Passion?'' or the Details article
``One Man. Five Ex-Girlfriends. You Do the Math.'' There's also a
personals section so McBealers can all get over their latest failed
relationship and dive headlong into another one.
</P>
<P>
   And to help McBealers on their way to another iffy relationship
is Match.com (http://www.match.com).The San Francisco-based Web
site is one of the best, least predatory, dating Web sites out
there. For two weeks, it's possible to test the service and search
for suitable mates based on a set of criteria the user selects,
including age, location, religion and even weight. Match.com
doesn't use real names, and the service employs an anonymous
remailer so if there are any psychos lurking on the service,
they'll never be able to find their way to your door.
</P>
<P>
   As anyone who watches ``Ally McBeal'' knows, Ally never goes
right home after work. She goes with all her co-workers to the same
bar, night after night, week after week. Most McBealers need a
little more variety than that in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   For this, there are a variety of entertainment sites this group
can visit to find out what's happening in their little chunk of the
universe. Since Ally lives in Boston, she might check out Boston
Sidewalk (http://boston.sidewalk.com), the Microsoft-run arts and
entertainment Web site with dining, drinking and entertainment
tips. Sidewalk has sites for most major cities, but some cities
have their own locally grown entertainment directories such as
Access Atlanta (http://www
</P>
<P>
   .accessatlanta.com/entertaiment/index.htm), which can send
Atlanta's McBealers on their way to dining, music and movie
nirvana, with content from various partners including The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Some McBealers may have absolutely no idea -- strange as it may

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
Some of Web's best stories may turn out to be myths 
By Frances Katz  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Do not believe everything you read.
</P>
<P>
   This may seem like obvious advice, but when it comes to the
Internet, it's worth repeating, or maybe scrawling in indelible ink
across the top of your computer monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most skeptical news junkie who checks at least five TV
networks and the newspaper before giving it any credibility will
believe anything e-mailed to them by a friend of a friend of a
friend.
</P>
<P>
   So before you hit the ``forward'' button to send any words of
wisdom on to your friends and co-workers, think about the following
Internet ruses.
</P>
<P>
   The Neiman-Marcus cookie story must have circled the globe more
times than all the NASA astronauts put together and is still going
strong. For a while, the official Nieman Marcus Web site had an
entire section devoted to debunking the story of the woman who
supposedly paid $250 for the recipe for Neiman's chocolate chip
cookies. The woman's alleged revenge was to post the recipe on the
Internet in the hopes that it would get as much attention as it is
getting. If nobody has sent you this recipe yet, you can check it
out at http://www.circ.uab
</P>
<P>
   .edu/cookies.html. And if you do have the ingredients on hand,
it won't cost you anything to whip up a batch.
</P>
<P>
   Another e-mail hoax sent round the world, was the alleged 1997
commencement speech given by noted American author Kurt Vonnegut at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The speech was a
collection of homespun wisdom that began with the sentence ``Ladies
and Gentlemen of the class of '97: Wear sunscreen. If I could offer
you only one tip for the future, sunscreen would be it.''
</P>
<P>
   You can read the rest of the speech at
http://www.cyberlink2000.com/9vonnegu.htm, but you should know
Vonnegut neither wrote nor delivered this speech. What's more
Vonnegut was not MIT's 1997 commencement speaker. Secretary General
of the United Nations Kofi Annan was. The pearls of wisdom were
actually from a column written by Chicago Tribune staff writer Mary
Schmich. Schmich offers her own take on being mistaken (at least in
cyberspace) for Vonnegut in one of her columns, which can be read
at http://www.recoil.com/mqarianstuff/wb/vonnegut.shtml.
</P>
<P>
   Stories such as these quickly pass into legend among cyberspace
veterans. They have become what is known as ``urban legends.''
There is an entire Web site devoted to the cataloguing and
debunking of these tall tales at http://www.urbanlegends.com.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows how these rumors get started. But be warned that
once something appears on the Internet it can circle the world at
an astonishing speed.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the case of the erroneous Associated Press report last
week. In error, the AP posted an obituary for comic Bob Hope on its
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas) believed the report
was real and asked that Hope's passing be announced on the floor of
the House of Representatives.

Cyberscene: Free, shareware programs can enhance Net experience 
By Bill Husted  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Internet is truly a wonderful and mysterious
place. Besides offering information on how to do anything from bake
a cake to get rid of fleas, it's also the world's biggest source of
both free and inexpensive computer programs.
</P>
<P>
   In just a few hours, you can get dozens of programs that will
help you use the Internet more efficiently. Even if your current
Internet provider included free Web browsing, e-mail and newsgroup
software, there are still plenty of programs that will save you
time and frustration.
</P>
<P>
   We'll start with Net.Medic. It gives an accurate reading of your
connection speed. Most folks don't understand that modems
constantly adjust in speed, based on line conditions. So, just
because you logged on at, say, 26k bps, that doesn't mean you'll be
operating at that speed later.
</P>
<P>
   You can get a free demonstration version of this software at
http://www.vitalsigns.com
</P>
<P>
   /product/download.html.
</P>
<P>
   Are you still using the e-mail program built into your Web
browser? If you are, you can make sending and receiving e-mail
(especially when files are attached to the e-mail you get) easier
by using Eudora Lite, a free version of Eudora Pro.
</P>
<P>
   Just set your browser for http://eudora.qualcomm.com
</P>
<P>
   /freeware/. You'll find versions of this program for both
Windows and Macintosh machines.
</P>
<P>
   Virus protection is increasingly important. But there's no real
need to buy a commercial anti-virus program. There are excellent
anti-virus programs available free or as shareware (where you
download the program and use it free and only pay if you find it
useful). Payment is on the honor system, and the fee is usually
much less than you'd pay for a program that you'd buy in a store.
</P>
<P>
   You can read about several of these programs -- in a list that
includes both shareware and free programs -- at http://tucows
</P>
<P>
   .pcihost.com/virus95.html.
</P>
<P>
   The next program is one most Internet providers hate. You'll
have to let your conscience be your guide here, so I'll tell you
how the program works and you decide if you'd like to try it.
</P>
<P>
   Some Internet providers automatically disconnect you after a
certain number of minutes if you aren't sending e-mail, browsing
the Web or downloading programs. The trouble with that is some
providers also disconnect you when you're actually using the Net
but just not sending or receiving information.
</P>
<P>
   There's software around that fools computers and the provider
into thinking you're actively using the computer. That way, you
don't get disconnected. You can get one of these programs at
http://tucows.pcihost.com
</P>
<P>
   /discon95.html.
</P>
<P>
   One of the problems with writing a column like this is knowing
what programs you need and use. Some folks could profit by a better
newsgroup reader; others need to find a new browser or a File
Transfer Protocol program that does a better job of downloading
than when you use a browser.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, there are sites that offer entire menus of downloads
--almost every program you can imagine for using the Internet. One
of these sites is called Stroud's Consummate Winsock Applications
and can be found at http://cws.internet.com/.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you never download a single program there, you'll learn
a lot about the Internet and the possibilities that it offers by
simply browsing the descriptions of what is available. You may find
just the thing to solve a problem you have.

SKY DAYTON PUSHES THE RIGHT BUTTONS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sky Dayton bounds up to meet you with the
friendly, open face of a puppy dog. He wears a cable-knit pullover
and chinos draped over a lean frame, and a beard that just isn't
filling in the way beards are supposed to.
</P>
<P>
   He's also got a big smile on his face. He should.
</P>
<P>
   _ The company he founded three years ago, EarthLink Network Inc.
in Pasadena, recently signed up its 500,000th customer, making it
the fourth-largest Internet service provider, behind America
Online, the Microsoft Network and AT&AMP;T. That's fast company.
</P>
<P>
   _ On Friday, Dayton's company took over Sprint Corp.'s 130,000
Internet customers. The $15 billion long-distance giant gets 30
percent of EarthLink, but also gives EarthLink $24 million in cash,
a $100 million credit line and marketing muscle most young Internet
companies dream about.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dayton's company reported record 1997 revenues of about $80
million, more than double 1996. And wonder of Internet wonders,
analysts say his company should end this year in the black.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and one other thing. Dayton is 26 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the New Economy.
</P>
<P>
   To get an idea how fast his company has grown, consider this:
</P>
<P>
   Dayton's personal office in its two-building headquarters takes
up more room than his entire company did when it started three
years in a Los Feliz medical building.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, Dayton had to scrape together every spare dime for a
party celebrating the company's 600th customer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a big goal for us back then,'' Dayton said. ``Now we
sign up 600 people in four hours.''
</P>
<P>
   He shakes his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been amazing. It's a great feeling,'' Dayton said.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton was raised mostly in Los Angeles, though he lived for a
time in Northern California with his grandfather, a tech whiz who
served a prestigious stint as an IBM Fellow.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks in part to his grandfather's Big Blue influence, Dayton
got into computers early, tinkering with a Timex Sinclair, one of
the earliest home PCs, at age 9. By his early 20s, Dayton decided
to try the Internet. But getting wired proved excruciating, even
for a wirehead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was utter hell,'' Dayton said. ``I got no sleep, I didn't
go to work.''
</P>
<P>
   After spending 80 hair-pulling hours trying to hook up, Dayton
decided to start his own Internet company, focused on helping
people become Netheads without Netheadaches.
</P>
<P>
   His company emphasized customer service at a time when most
competitors didn't. That emphasis continues, with more than half
the company's 1,000 employees working in tech support and customer
service.
</P>
<P>
   The company put together a software package called Total Access
that installs Netscape Navigator and other programs, then walks a
new customer through the connection process.
</P>
<P>
   Subscribers can create a customized ``start page'' on their Web
browser that includes news headlines in areas of interest, local
weather forecasts, stock quotes and more.
</P>
<P>
   The company even has a ``guardian angel'' program watching for
the ``connected but confused,'' calling to see if they need help.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these programs they do are really unique,'' said David
Goodtree, director of telecom strategies at Forrester Research in
Cambridge, Mass. ``When's the last time the phone company called
you up and asked if everything was going all right?''
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what Sprint thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason we linked up is we saw EarthLink being an
outstanding Internet service provider,'' said Sprint assistant vice
president Bill White. ``We saw we could grow much more rapidly by
partnering with them. They know the service well, have more scale
than we did, and there were a lot of opportunities for
cross-promotion and cross-marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal should help both sides, said Goodtree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sprint spent a lot of money trying to launch an Internet
service and what they realized was they still didn't get it,'' said
Goodtree. ``EarthLink is known for great technical support and
customer service.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprint's top executive was equally admiring of Dayton, White
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chairman (and CEO) Bill Esrey is very impressed with him,''
White said. ``He's an entrepreneurial, energetic guy who knows what
he wants to accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   From Dayton's point of view, the Sprint deal is only the biggest
of dozens of partnerships _ ranging from movie companies to
publishers to discount stores to credit cards _ that have stretched
EarthLink's resources by piggybacking on others' money and
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   In the Dayton vocabulary, partnering is a very big word,
encapsulated by his Dayton Theory of Internet Market Evolution.
Basically, Dayton says, smart companies focus on their business
niche, then find partners to do everything else.
</P>
<P>
   ``By creating that model, I was able to figure out who the
partners and the competitors are,'' Dayton said. ``Then it was a
matter of convincing the right partners to do the right deals.''
</P>
<P>
   He sees Hollywood as a particularly fertile place for
partnering, going back to marketing deals with movies such as ``The
Net'' and ``Contact,'' part of Dayton's ``evangelizing'' of the
entertainment business the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   As Dayton looks toward the future, he believes his company, and
the Internet in general, are well positioned to become a
mass-market phenomenon, moving beyond the technically proficient to
a basic part of most American households.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, the Internet wasn't a consumer product,'' Dayton said.
``Now, it's a baseline communications tool.''
</P>
<P>
   The implications are particularly interesting for the
entertainment business, Dayton said, because increasingly, the
Internet will be the way its products _ video, music, publishing _
arrive in the American home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entertainment business thrives on communication,'' Dayton
said. ``The Internet represents the best way to put more of their
product out there. We are the channel of distribution.''
</P>
<P>
   Dayton has no plans to follow AOL and MSN into the content
creation business, however, saying EarthLink will continue do what
it does well and find more partners to do the entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons we're so successful is that I'm so focused
and the company is so focused,'' Dayton said.
</P>
<P>
   For Dayton, that means his company must be able to grow as the
Internet grows. That means being able to delegate.
</P>
<P>
   As the company boomed, Dayton did something many entrepreneurs
don't. He brought in help, led by CEO Garry Betty, a veteran
telecommunications executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make sure I'm surrounded by good people,'' Dayton
said. ``I think we have the most talented CEO in the business. We
work great together.''
</P>
<P>
   Betty said Dayton was ``smart enough to say, `I need help.' He
said, `You're running the company,' and he never looked back.''
</P>
<P>
   Dayton's company still faces many challenges, including such
threats as cable companies that would provide Internet service with
cable modems, said Goodtree. But, ``there's plenty of room for
EarthLink. They're squarely focused and pretty much the cream of
the crop,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton, who lives in Toluca Lake with his wife, Arwen, said he
feels confident about the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a good position in the first leg of a long race,''
Dayton said. ``I think this can be a major, major communications
company.''

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
Cherry Coke and its promo game ... it's the online thing 
By Frances Katz  
 c. 1998 Cox News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You need 32 different bottles of Cherry Coke to win
the new CD-ROM game, ``Alanna.''
</P>
<P>
   However, if you don't want to scour every store in town for pop
bottles cluttered with clues, there's the official Cherry Coke Web
site (http://www.cherrycoke.com). There, players will find a Web
site for the fictional Standlake University. That Web site is
riddled with real clues for the game, whose players traverse the
deserted island of ``Alanna'' collecting objects and solving
riddles to get past gateways, boulders and rivers. (The answers to
the first puzzle are on the site now, for example.)
</P>
<P>
   Marketing on the Web isn't easy. But Coca-Cola's clever Web
promotions make it one of the smartest Web marketers around.
</P>
<P>
   Brand manager Tom Halloran says the ``Alanna'' promotion _ the
latest in Coca-Cola's use of the Web to promote various brands _ is
designed to increase the appeal of Cherry Coke to teens and young
adults who are part of what he calls ``the emerging wired
generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Free-thinking Web surfers are usually loathe to visit a
marketing site just for the fun of it. Most savvy Web marketers
know that a site that engages users, with games or polls or other
interactive components, reinforces the brand and gives users and
potential customers a reason to come back.
</P>
<P>
   No one understands this as well as Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   Halloran says the bulk of his consumers are young and spend a
lot of time on the Net and playing computer games. ``We thought,
`How can we tie in the fact that a lot of teens are playing
computer games and drinking Coke?'''
</P>
<P>
   What makes the Coke promotions especially unusual is that they
are not designed to be Web staples. They are used on an ``as
needed'' basis for seasonal promotions tied into its traditional ad
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola says the Cherry Coke promotion and the ``Alanna'' game
will run at least through November, with new clues and information.
</P>
<P>
   All this interactivity is designed to leave game players and
their friends with the impression Cherry Coke is a hip, cutting
edge product.
</P>
<P>
   Because Coca-Cola is mindful of its young target audience,
``Alanna'' is not a bloody shoot-'em-up game but a lush, quiet
``Myst''-like game with an educational component designed to help
players win the game.
</P>
<P>
   To add a touch of realism, the company also enlisted the help of
an Emory University professor who created the fictional Standlake
University of Cultural Anthropology Web site. Once there, you must
read through each page of that site to find out about topics such
as cuneiform symbols and ancient Babylonia _ just a way to add an
educational component to the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely put an educational slant to the game,'' Halloran
says. ``We want to educate our teen customers. A lot of the clues
on the game site are based on ancient cultures. It's kind of a
study of archaeology.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no official list of hints or clues to help users solve
the puzzle. Folks intent on winning must keep visiting the site or
checking out different bottles of Cherry Coke. They can also check
out Coke and gaming Usenet newsgroups to swap clues and information
with other game players.
</P>
<P>
   A recent check of newsgroups shows several postings to
``comp.sys.ibm.pc.games'' and ``alt.food.cocacola'' talking about
the game and swapping tips and hints. Halloran calls this
world-of-mouth buzz ``viral marketing'' since he hopes it'll spread
that way. ``We're hoping there will be online chat and posts,'' he
says. ``We're hoping people will interact with the brand and each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   The promotion appears to be an expensive proposition, but
Coca-Cola won't say just how expensive it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we really didn't want to go down the route of a
traditional soft drink promotion,'' Halloran said. ``We think the
bang for the buck using the Internet and gaming is going to be
substantial for this particular brand.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no print ads, nor are there CD-ROMs available at any
Coke point of sale. The company is relying on word of mouth and the
Web to spread the word about Cherry Coke.
</P>
<P>
   ``This promotion is very different,'' Halloran said. ``It will
require consumers to think and act differently. It's a way to show
off the new version of Cherry Coke and get them engaged with the
product by playing the game. We want to be seen as something very
different from Coca-Cola.

AOL TO PAY PREMIUM PRICE FOR CHAT SERVICE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SAUL HANSELL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With all the frenzy over the Internet, entrepreneurs
have been able to create and sell companies for huge sums without
ever earning a dime. But in what may be a record of financial
weightlessness, America Online said Monday that it would pay at
least $287 million for a company that has never taken in a penny in
revenue and has no plans to start charging money.
</P>
<P>
   What the company, an Israeli firm called Mirabilis Ltd., does
have is users, 12 million of them who spend an average of more than
an hour a day on its Internet chat service.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, America Online hopes to put advertising on the chat
service and sell its members products and services. ``When you talk
about making money on the Internet, no one is doing more than
America Online,'' said Robert Pittman, the company's president.
</P>
<P>
   He compared the Internet today to the early days of cable
television. MTV, which Pittman helped start, only took in $500,000
in revenue its first year.
</P>
<P>
   Mirabilis is highly regarded among savvy Internet users for its
chat service, known as ICQ (shorthand for ``I seek you''), which
enables them to detect when fellow users are on line and to
communicate instantly with them. With no promotion other than word
of mouth, it has already achieved something of a cult status,
growing at more than 50,000 subscribers a day.
</P>
<P>
   ICQ is attractive to America Online because it appeals to a much
younger and technologically sophisticated audience than the
mainstream America Online brand. ``If this were 1980, think
underground album-oriented rock radio,'' Pittman said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said, ICQ users spend an average of 75 minutes a
day on the service, compared with less than 10 minutes a day for
highly touted search and directory services such as Yahoo and
Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   Many Internet stock analysts praised the deal as an inexpensive
way for America Online to increase its customer relationships. The
company's shares rose $1 Monday, to $84.25.
</P>
<P>
   But there is some skepticism that chat services, no matter how
popular, will turn into big money makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``E-mail, chat and instant messaging are not good advertising
platforms,'' said Bo Peabody, the chief executive of Tripod, an
online community service recently bought by Lycos. ``When you chat,
you look at what you are writing, not what other people are
writing,'' he said. Moreover, advertisers worry that their
advertisements will be associated with content that they do not
control and may be embarrassing. As a result, chat services that do
take ads receive the lowest rates of any type of Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   That has not stopped other companies from buying similar
services. Most notably, Microsoft paid a reported $400 million for
Hotmail, which offers free e-mail services. (Unlike ICQ, Hotmail
had started to sell advertisements and had other plans for selling
services.)
</P>
<P>
   Mirabilis also helps America Online's efforts to expand
overseas. About 40 percent of ICQ's members are in the United
States, 40 percent are in Europe, and the rest are spread
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Mirabilis was founded two years ago by four Israelis in their
early 20s. With a few million dollars in backing from local
investors, it has built one of the most popular services on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Yossi Vardi, Mirabilis' chairman, said the company had been in
discussions with a number of suitors since last August. But they
were initially put off by the price the company wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were quite amazed with our growth and it took them a
while to come to grips with that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   America Online agreed to pay $287 million in cash upfront and up
to $120 million in additional payments starting in 2001, depending
on the performance of Mirabilis, which will continue to be run as a
separate subsidiary in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   America Online's own Internet chat service, AOL Instant
Messenger, will continue to be a separate product mainly to allow
Internet users to communicate with those on America Online's
service. America Online will also provide some technical support to
Mirabilis.
</P>
<P>
   Peabody of Tripod said that since America Online now controlled
the two largest chat services it should embrace an open standard
that would allow the user of any chat service to send an instant
message to a user of a competing service, much as electronic mail
works now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that AOL has a monopoly on the instant messenger space,
I'm hopeful they will open the market to everyone,'' he said.
Tripod hopes to offer its own message service and such a standard
would help it break into the existing market.
</P>
<P>
   Tricia Primrose, a spokeswoman for America Online, said that
there were no standards for instant messages now, but that
``historically AOL supports open standards that gain critical mass
and acceptance by consumers.''

 Netscape Puts Some Flash Into Web Browser  
 By David Einstein   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Angling for an edge in its war with Microsoft, Netscape
Communications said yesterday it will incorporate animation
technology into an upgrade of its popular Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   Starting this summer, Netscape Communicator will include the
Flash player, which lets users view animated content designed with
Macromedia's Flash software.
</P>
<P>
   Flash _ the latest incarnation of Macromedia's popular Shockwave
software _ is widely used to add animation to Web sites for movies,
television shows and consumer products.
</P>
<P>
   The Flash player is currently available as a ``plug-in'' for
both the Netscape and Microsoft browsers. Web surfers must download
the player from the Internet and install it in their browsers.
Macromedia officials claim that 40 million copies of the Flash
player have been downloaded in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape's move eliminates the need to download and plug in the
Flash player.
</P>
<P>
   ``This creates a big advantage for the Netscape user, who wants
to enjoy a really rich Web experience without having to go get a
plug-in,'' said Bob Lisbonne, senior vice president of Client
Products at Mountain View-based Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage might not last long. Microsoft plans to include
the Flash player (along with the Internet Explorer browser) in
versions of Windows 98 that come with new computers. Macromedia
officials said Microsoft also may decide to put the Flash player
into the upgrade version of Windows 98 sold in stores.
</P>
<P>
   The real winner in yesterday's deal could be Macromedia, which
has been trying to regain the heights it attained during the first
wave of Internet mania two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Macromedia was originally known for its programs that let
developers working on Macintosh computers design multimedia
software and games. The San Francisco company became a Wall Street
darling when Shockwave caught on as a tool for animating Web sites.
Macromedia's stock soared as high as $62.50 in the winter of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But a series of ill-advised acquisitions and softness in the
Apple Macintosh market led to four losses in the five quarters
prior to its last one. That, coupled with a deflation in the value
of Internet stocks, sent Macromedia's shares plunging to a low of
$7 in April of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Former Silicon Graphics executive Bob Burgess was brought in to
turn the situation around. He cleaned up the product line and
focused the company on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The prescription may be working. In its latest quarter,
Macromedia showed a profit of 5 cents a share on revenue of $30
million. And its stock has doubled since late January, closing
yesterday at $16.13.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are improving for them,'' said analyst Greg Vogel of
NationsBanc Montgomery Securities. ``The new management is pretty
solid, they're doing the right thing in focusing on the Internet
and they have some products that are doing pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal with Netscape may not give Macromedia's bottom line a
big boost, said Vogel, ``but it's a significant endorsement for
them.''

 Sources Say Intel Bullying Into 3-D 
By Tom Abate   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's an allegation against Intel that the Federal Trade
Commission isn't investigating _ yet.
</P>
<P>
   Two industry sources said yesterday that Intel has been trying
to muscle its way into the 3-D market by ``bundling'' its 3-D chip
_ the I-740 _ with its Pentium II microprocessor and Pentium II
chipset.
</P>
<P>
   The sources said Intel has told Taiwanese PC vendors that the
best way to get large volumes of Pentium IIs is to buy them as a
package deal with I-740 3-D graphics chips.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spoke to at least 20 companies at a trade show here, and
that's what they're saying,'' market researcher John Latta said
yesterday in an interview from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Latta is president of 4thWave, a market research firm in
Alexandria, Va., that publishes a newsletter for industry
executives.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Peddie, a Tiburon-based chip analyst, confirmed some parts
of Latta's report.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taiwanese motherboard manufacturers are horny as hell for
Pentium IIs, and they may be accepting these bundle deals to get
more P2s,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Antitrust lawyers say it can be anti-competitive if a company
with monopoly power bundles new products with its market-leading
offering.
</P>
<P>
   Peddie said he didn't think that Intel would be ``stupid
enough'' to do anything illegal. But he described Intel as a
newcomer to the 3-D market, trying to take share from S3, ATI,
Matrox, Cirrus Logic, Trident, 3DFX, Rendition and 3D Labs.
</P>
<P>
   An executive at one 3-D firm, who asked to remain anonymous,
told me that Intel's tactics have hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had dinner with one (Taiwanese) customer the day after he
met with (a top Intel exec),'' the source said. ``Our customer said
he would have to buy Intel's 3-D graphics chip'' to get other Intel
chips.
</P>
<P>
   The executive has never complained to the FTC because he doesn't
think the feds can move fast enough.
</P>
<P>
   Intel spokesman Tom Waldrop said Latta is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bundling report is untrue,'' he said, rejecting ``any
inference there that there's some antitrust violation. We are very
careful with our (sales) policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Waldrop said the supply of Pentium II chips is increasing very
rapidly and that there is no shortage for Intel to take advantage
of.
</P>
<P>
   A source close to Intel characterized the 3-D allegations as
``piling on'' by competitors trying to exploit yesterday's
antitrust news.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Here come da judge: &LR;  The FTC's antitrust case now goes to
administrative law Judge James Timony.
</P>
<P>
   Art Amolsch, editor of the FTCWatch Newsletter, described Timony
as an independent jurist who has been known to reject cases that he
feels are unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Timony did several years ago, when the FTC voted to
file suit against the college football association, alleging that
it had restricted the supply of televised college football by
deciding which schools could sell broadcast rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Timony said the FTC has no power over nonprofit groups, and
ultimately, his view prevailed,'' Amolsch said.
</P>
<P>
   But last year, Timony ruled that New Jersey-based Toys `R' Us
had illegally tried to keep toy manufacturers from selling toys to
shopping clubs. That case is still on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Personal notes: &LR;  The four FTC commissioners who debated
Intel's fate are a colorful lot. Their chairman is Bob Pitofsky, a
former Georgetown University law professor and expert on antitrust
law. It was he who engineered the three-vote majority in favor of
taking action against Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Joining him was Sheila Anthony, a personal friend of Bill and
Hillary Clinton and sister of late White House aide Vincent Foster.
</P>
<P>
   Mozelle Thompson, a former Treasury official, cast the third
``Yes'' vote, leaving Orson Swindle, the commission's lone
Republican, to cast the single dissent.
</P>
<P>
   Swindle was the first national leader of Ross Perot's United We
Stand America group. A former Marine aviator, Swindle was shot down
over Vietnam and spent several years in a North Vietnamese POW
camp. His cellmate was John McCain, now a U.S. senator from
Arizona.

ONLINE WORLD ADDS NEW PERIL TO JOB HUNTING
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After the march, the diploma and the champagne,
area graduates have to face this sober fact: Landing a job.
</P>
<P>
   Even though they face one of the best job markets in recent
history, job seekers should not be complacent, recruiters say.
Indeed, pitfalls await the unprepared grad from beginning to end.
</P>
<P>
   And with cyberspace getting a big share of job applications, new
protocols have emerged for job seekers as well: Should applicants
send a hard copy resume after e-mailing it? Is it appropriate to
provide a personal Web site address on an online resume? How does
an applicant follow up on an application _ call or e-mail?
</P>
<P>
   ``Graduates have degrees in certain industries. They don't have
a degree in interviewing and how to get hired,'' said Lynn Taylor,
research director for OfficeTeam, a unit of employment services
firm Robert Half International.
</P>
<P>
   Consider these blunders by actual candidates in an OfficeTeam
survey:
</P>
<P>
   _ An employer walked into the lobby to meet a nervous candidate,
whose mouth displayed a ring of antacid from the bottle he was
holding.
</P>
<P>
   _ An applicant was asked why she wanted the job. ``I'm here for
a paycheck, isn't everybody?''
</P>
<P>
   _ An entry-level candidate became so animated during an
interview that his clip-on tie fell off.
</P>
<P>
   _ A job seeker fell asleep during a job interview.
</P>
<P>
   _ A candidate pulled his pet iguana from his briefcase, saying,
``I didn't want to bring him here, but he hates to be alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the examples are as extreme as they are funny. But
there are more subtle mistakes that can kill an applicant's chances
_ and that's no laughing matter.
</P>
<P>
   When sending resumes online, it's a good idea to send one in
ASCII or plain text format with a file attachment of a Microsoft
Word or WordPerfect document, said Ken Ramberg, founder of JobTrak,
a Los Angeles-based online job search company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any computer can open ASCII,'' he said. The Word or
WordPerfect files provide a refined version of one's resume to
employers who can access it.
</P>
<P>
   Since recruiters want to see resumes that fit on one printed
page, it's OK to provide a link to a personal Web page for the
employer to look through, as long as it will help _ not hurt _ the
candidate, Ramberg added.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a silly or humorous Web page will probably hamper
the chances of an applicant seeking a job at a bank or investment
house.
</P>
<P>
   Before e-mailing the resume to the company, send a copy to
yourself first to make sure the format and font show up fine, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Don't use fancy graphics, unless the job calls it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Employers want the resume to pull up quickly. Be
straightforward with the data,'' said Marc Goldman, corporate
marketing vice president at AppleOne Employment Services, a
staffing firm in Glendale.
</P>
<P>
   Send both a cover letter and resume with the online application,
Taylor said. The cover letter reinforces the candidate's interest
in the job.
</P>
<P>
   It's advisable, but not necessary, to send a hard copy cover
letter and resume after e-mailing them to the employer, Goldman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Call or e-mail the company within a week to make sure they have
received the application, but don't make a pest of yourself, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   To get your resume noticed, plug in buzzwords for the job
opening, whether or not you're applying online. Because employers
receive thousands of resumes, many Fortune 1000 companies'
computers scan them for certain key words to narrow their search.
</P>
<P>
   Resumes containing the words sought _ such as C++ for a computer
programming job _ will be retained and gradually narrowed down to a
pool of candidates that the company can handle.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Amgen, based in Ventura County's Thousand Oaks,
does.
</P>
<P>
   The biotech firm, for instance, may scan for the word ``DNA
sequencing'' in resumes of candidates applying for a research
associate or scientist position, said Thomas Hutton, senior manager
of staffing and staffing operations.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the company will fine-tune the search to include
words like ``biology degree'' and ``chemistry degree'' or ``master
of science.''
</P>
<P>
   When the pool is sufficiently narrowed, Amgen recruiters then
look at the individual resumes for work experience, skills and
other factors.
</P>
<P>
   But don't get carried away and list all possible skills, Taylor
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be careful not to say proficiency if you only have some
exposure to it. It could get you in trouble later on,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It's critical to make a good first impression with one's resume
and cover letter, since they usually form the candidate's first
contact with the company, recruiters say.
</P>
<P>
   Misspellings, grammatical errors, smudges and a poor print job
will hurt an applicant's chances. Using brightly colored paper also
isn't recommended for most positions, recruiters said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go to Kinko's. It's money well-spent,'' Goldman said. ``The
first impression is sometimes the only impression you get to make.
Make it perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Let someone else proofread them before they're mailed out, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   As for content, the most relevant work and academic experience
should be highlighted. A college graduate without years of
experience in the field would do well to emphasize any academic
achievements, internships or part-time jobs. A high grade-point
average should be listed as well.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
NYT-06-08-98 2127EDT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But tell the truth. Listing false degrees or job experiences can
be grounds for termination later on, recruiters say.
</P>
<P>
   Once an interview is granted, the candidate should research the
company's business, culture and goals to prepare for the one-on-one
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   With the Internet making research easy, candidates have no
excuse for not finding out about their prospective employers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing how many college graduates don't do it,'' said
Anthony Mulkern, founder of Mulkern Associates, a Glendale
management consulting firm that helps recruiters assess job
candidates. ``There's no excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   On the day of the interview, dress conservatively. That means
dark-colored suits for men and women, preferably navy blue. Even if
the company has a casual dress policy, the recruiter wants to see
the candidate at his or her best.
</P>
<P>
   ``You take a risk when you go outside that set,'' Hutton said.
</P>
<P>
   Look neat. Men should trim beards and chuck any earrings,
Goldman said. Women shouldn't wear overpowering perfume or big
jewelry, but panty hose are a must.
</P>
<P>
   Show up a little early for the interview. In Southern
California, that means allowing enough time for traffic.
</P>
<P>
   When meeting recruiters, have a firm handshake and look them in
the eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to like somebody who won't look you in the eyes,''
Goldman said. ``(Recruiters) will hire someone they feel
comfortable with.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, be prepared but stay away from canned answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost as bad as coming in too slick,'' Mulkern said.
</P>
<P>
   Recruiters don't like candidates who oversell themselves without
having anything specific to back their claims, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, before claiming to be a team player, candidates
must come up with specific examples where they exhibited this
quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to talk about what they have done specifically
rather than (spout) vague generalities,'' Mulkern said.
</P>
<P>
   After the interview, send a thank-you note within a day or two
of the meeting reiterating your interest in and appropriateness for
the job.
</P>
<P>
   Having recommended all that, job recruiters say there's one
exception to all those rules: computer programmers.
</P>
<P>
   With more jobs than graduates, competition for candidates is
stiff.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're good, you can get away with almost anything,''
Ramberg said.

ONE WAY AROUND WINDOWS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By WARREN WILSON   
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ If Microsoft Windows were a religion, a core belief
would be that the computer screen and the Windows desktop are
nearly the same thing: The desktop fills the screen and displays
everything the user needs to know.
</P>
<P>
   Time for some heresy, Seattle software designer Tom O'Rourke
says.
</P>
<P>
   O'Rourke's new venture, The Pixel Co., unveiled technology
Monday that uses the dark border at the edge of the desktop for a
new control bar called MySpace that is separate from Microsoft
Windows and can launch applications, find Internet content and
control devices such as CD and DVD players.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting technology,'' said analyst Bob Sakakeeny of The
Aberdeen Group in Boston. ``We can't think of anything that comes
close.''
</P>
<P>
   If it wins market acceptance, MySpace might loosen Microsoft's
lock on the PC screen. And it could lob a new rock into the pond of
legal, technological, political and economic issues surrounding
Microsoft that led to the federal antitrust lawsuits filed last
month.
</P>
<P>
   While supporting Microsoft's key legal claim that the software
industry is rich with innovation, MySpace could give computer
makers something the government says they lack _ non-Microsoft ways
to customize their machines. It also undermines claims by
Microsoft's critics that the Redmond company stifles innovation by
others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a case where a small company did something that Sun,
Oracle and Netscape all said couldn't be done, and that's get
around the Microsoft franchise,'' said Rob Enderle, an industry
analyst with the Giga Information Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's new, it's fresh, it's different,'' said Martin Mortensen
of The Gartner Group in Stamford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a piece of technology that basically shows that Microsoft
isn't that dominant, that they do allow other technologies to come
up to the surface.''
</P>
<P>
   A Microsoft spokeswoman said the company couldn't comment
because it hadn't yet seen the MySpace technology.
</P>
<P>
   At Ark Interface II, Pixel's parent company, O'Rourke has
specialized in software that sits atop the Windows operating system
to give users what he believes are easier ways to find files and
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Ark developed a program called Navigator (older than and
completely different from the Internet browser made by Netscape
Communications) that employed a home metaphor similar to that of
Microsoft's short-lived ``Bob'' project.
</P>
<P>
   Packard Bell liked Navigator so much that it first licensed
Navigator to install on its machines, then purchased Ark Interface
in 1994. Over time, however, Microsoft's efforts to standardize the
Windows experience made it more difficult for computer makers to
offer shell programs like Navigator, O'Rourke said.
</P>
<P>
   The MySpace project was born 15 months ago, he said, when, in a
fit of frustration, he noticed a picture-in-picture display on his
television and wondered if the same thing couldn't be done on a
computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody said, `You can't go there,''' O'Rourke said. He
begged to differ, gradually persuading colleagues that it would be
possible to use the dark territory outside the desktop, called the
overscan area, to deliver new features.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've taken over that dead space and built a little kernel of
an operating system that lets it have some functionality,'' said
Lora Loftis, Pixel's communications director.
</P>
<P>
   That's a key point: MySpace isn't an application that runs on
top of Windows, it's a separate system.
</P>
<P>
   It can launch Windows applications, but it could just as easily
launch some other operating system _ Linux, Unix, or an eventual
Java OS, O'Rourke said.
</P>
<P>
   It also provides a space where other companies can offer their
content to computer users in partnership with Pixel and the
computer makers, instead of or in addition to partnering with
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   An entertainment company, for example, could put buttons on the
MySpace control bar that connected people directly to its Web sites
for books or television programs.
</P>
<P>
   Ark Interface II spun off The Pixel Co. last year. The two were
recently sold by the parent company, now called Packard Bell NEC,
the fourth-largest PC vendor in the United States and the
fifth-largest in the world, according to International Data Corp.
It shipped 2.8 million units in the United States last year and 4.2
million worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Packard Bell NEC plans to offer MySpace on new Packard Bell
machines and NEC's consumer line, called Ready, in the near future,
though not on its first Windows 98 machines, said Mal Ransom,
senior vice president of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's technology that makes sense,'' Ransom said. ``When you
see it, you think, why did it take somebody so long to discover it?
But the market will have to speak for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Enderle said MySpace offered computer makers a way to make their
products stand out in the marketplace, while Sakakeeny noted that
the legal and political attention focused on Microsoft may work to
Pixel's advantage.

   ``The timing is pretty good for acceptance of a product like
this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both analysts echoed Ransom's cautionary note.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest struggle is not for them to do a good job creating
the product, it's getting the product accepted,'' Sakakeeny said.
``That's not an easy feat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It opens a number of doors,'' Enderle said. ``The question is
whether (software) developers will take advantage of them....
</P>
<P>
   ``In reviewing the people they have on board, I certainly think
there's a reasonable chance they can do this,'' he said. ``But it's
by no means a slam dunk.''

 Antivirus Firm's British Expansion  
 By Julia Angwin   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fast-growing Network Associates of Santa Clara bought a foothold
in the European antivirus software market yesterday with its $640
million purchase of Dr. Solomon's Group PLC of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Network Associates makes the leading antivirus software in the
United States _ McAfee VirusScan _ but is always looking for ways
to increase its lead over No. 2 antivirus software-maker Symantec
Corp. of Cupertino.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have three goals: To extend our leadership position in
antivirus, to make a geography play in Europe and to add 150 sales
people in Europe,'' said Bill Larson, chief executive of Network
Associates.
</P>
<P>
   This is Network Associates' 12th acquisition since Larson took
over as CEO of what was then-known as McAfee Associates in 1993. He
has used the buying spree to turn the antivirus firm into a
one-stop shop for corporate security and network management.
</P>
<P>
   After the acquisition is completed, Network Associates plans to
give corporate customers Dr. Solomon's Anti-Virus Toolkit along
with McAfee VirusScan, which may sometimes uncover different
viruses. By next year, Larson said, the firm will create a version
of the software for corporate customers that includes the best of
both products.
</P>
<P>
   But the company will continue to sell the two separate products
in stores. Larson said McAfee VirusScan will cost about 29 pounds
compared to Dr. Solomon's 69 pounds in England. But in the United
States where Dr. Solomon's is not well-known, he said the price
ratio will be reversed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will let us hit multiple price points,'' Larson said.
``It's kind of a classic Procter &AMP; Gamble play.''
</P>
<P>
   Larson said he also hopes to use the Dr. Solomon's 150-person
sales force to sell other Network Associates products to the 10
million to 15 million Dr. Solomon's customerswho are primarily in
England and Northern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives Network Associates an opportunity to expand its
presence quite nicely,'' said Chris Shilakes, an analyst at Merrill
Lynch in San Francisco. ``It certainly makes sense to us.''
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts worry that Network Associates, the nation's
10th largest software firm, may be stretching itself too thin with
its long string of acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to buy up a lot of technologies; it's another
thing to integrate and sell them,'' said Jim Balderston, analyst at
Zona Research in Redwood City. ``That is easier said than done.''
</P>
<P>
   And Symantec officials said the move was simply a reaction to
Symantec's recent co-marketing agreement with giant computer-maker
IBM.
</P>
<P>
   ``The balance of power was shifting because we had IBM behind
us, so now they're reacting so they don't lose too much ground,''
said Enrique Salem, vice president of the Cupertino-based firm.
</P>
<P>
   But Wall Street applauded the move, boosting Network Associates
shares up $1.88 _ by 4 percent _ to $43.88 and boosting Dr.
Solomon's stock up $3.38 _ by 11 percent _ to $35.50.

 NBC Buys Stake In Cnet to Get Online On-Ramp  
 By Jamie Beckett   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a deal marrying the top broadcast network with one of the
least-known Web directories, NBC said yesterday that it is buying a
stake in Cnet and gradually will take over its Snap! navigation
site.
</P>
<P>
   The TV network will invest $26 million to buy 4.9 percent of San
Francisco-based Cnet, best known for its Web sites offering
technology news. That's just what the network pays for two episodes
of ``ER,'' the top-rated show on television.
</P>
<P>
   NBC is purchasing the 19 percent stake in Cnet's fledgling Snap!
Internet directory and navigation service for an undisclosed sum,
with an option to own 60 percent of Snap! for $38 million.
</P>
<P>
   NBC executives, who immediately will start running Snap! jointly
with Cnet, said they hope to turn the site into a major Internet
gateway, or portal, similar to Yahoo, America Online or Excite.
Typically, Net users begin their Internet experiences on these
sites, which often provide news, personalized content and e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``The portal space is where the eyeballs and the money are on
the Internet,'' said Marty Yudkovitz, president of NBC Interactive
Media. ``It is the pivotal place to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Cnet's shares jumped $12.13 to close at $45.13 on Nasdaq
yesterday _ a 36.7 percent rise, making it the second-biggest
gainer of all U.S. stocks. The stocks of other Internet gateway
companies also were up yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Cnet launched Snap! in September and has invested some $25
million in the money-losing service, said Halsey Minor, chairman
and chief executive of Cnet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all about making Snap! successful,'' Minor said. ``As
a more mature media company, NBC has a tremendous amount of
expertise, as well as tremendous relationships with advertisers
exceeding those of anyone on the Internet today.''
</P>
<P>
   After the deal closes, NBC will cover Snap! expenses, Minor
said, although he will be its chief executive. Yudkovitz and three
other NBC executives will join the Snap! board to make a majority.
</P>
<P>
   NBC said it intends to promote Snap! on its television network
and on several of its other Internet properties. Snap! likely will
rely on NBC for some of its content, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   That content will give Snap! an edge _ the same way Excite's
recent agreement to run Disney content provides an advantage, said
David Simons, managing director of Digital Video Investments in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's content that moves the masses,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   NBC officials said they were keen on getting further into the
Internet business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no secret that broadcast television is not a growth
business. This investment is fundamental to NBC's growth,''
Yudkovitz said.
</P>
<P>
   The television network said it will bring in ``select NBC
employees'' to work at Snap! in the future, but it has no definite
plans. All 170 full-time workers and part-time contractors at Snap!
will keep their jobs, Yudkovitz said.
</P>
<P>
   NBC did not indicate when it will exercise its option to raise
its stake in Snap!
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first media company that has really gone into
building a portal,'' said Regina Joseph, senior analyst at Jupiter
Communications in New York. ``I think we'll see a lot of other
media companies follow suit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cnet investment is only the latest of NBC's Internet
ventures. In addition to MSNBC, its 24-hour cable TV and online
news network operated jointly with Microsoft, the network has an
entertainment site, an on-demand Internet video service and a
localized Internet community guide service.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's deal with Cnet is the most recent move by a media titan to
try to cash in on the Bay Area's technology boom.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Forbes Inc. said it will establish a West Coast base
in Burlingame. New York publishing giant Ziff-Davis launched ZDTV,
a cable TV channel for high-tech news, in San Francisco in May.
Knight Ridder said in April that it will transfer its corporate
headquarters to Silicon Valley to make a bigger splash for its Web
operations.

 Software Helps Tap Lost Riches in a Company's Patents  
 By Tom Abate   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the high-tech economy, managing a portfolio of patents can
unlock hidden revenues.
</P>
<P>
   SmartPatents, a startup in Mountain View, is automating this
process with a new software that shows firms how to extract more
wealth from their intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
   The software can suggest new ways to license a patent or tell a
company if the patent is obsolete and not worth the fees to keep
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a huge patent game being played out there at the
highest levels of major corporations,'' said Kevin Rivette, chief
executive of SmartPatents. ``IBM makes a billion dollars a year
licensing patents.''
</P>
<P>
   A company that gets an intellectual lock on a hot technology can
keep competitors out of a market, or charge them to enter it
</P>
<P>
   But analyzing patents has always been a black art. Companies had
to rely on a legal priesthood for advice on when to sue their
competitors, or back out of a market lest they get sued themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Rivette and co-founder Irving Rappaport, both noted patent
attorneys, have spent the past five years creating software with
the legal smarts of a good patent attorney. They won't say how many
firms have plunked down $50,000 or more for their computer-aided
advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our clients consider our software a competitive advantage,''
said SmartPatents President Dan'l Lewin, a former Apple executive
and friend of Steve Jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Malley, intellectual property chief for Lucent
Technologies, said he has spent the Last two years using the
program to manage that intellectual gold mine known as Bell Labs.
</P>
<P>
   ``SmartPatents is to patent management what Visicalc was to
accounting many years ago,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; No free telephony? &LR;  Back in private practice after a
three-year stint at the Federal Communications Commission, attorney
Rachelle Chong is sounding the alarm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FCC is considering regulating Internet telephony,'' Chong
said. ``This is the next big clash between the government and the
computer industry.''
</P>
<P>
   You remember Internet telephony? Plug your computer into the
Internet, talk into the microphone and dial anywhere in the world,
for free.
</P>
<P>
   But Chong said the five-member commission is starting to wonder
whether Internet service providers who offer some forms of
telephony should be considered long-distance companies. If so, they
might be subjected to the same rules and charges, which can add 5
cents a minute to every ``free'' call.
</P>
<P>
   Chong, who hopes to head off any regulation, says four of the
five current commissioners are new and unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the newcomers is FCC Chairman William Kennard, a former
FCC staff attorney familiar with the 1996 Telecommunications Reform
Act.
</P>
<P>
   He is joined by Michael Powell, an antitrust lawyer and son of
Army General Colin Powell; Gloria Tristani, a former state PUC
commissioner from New Mexico; and Harold Furchtgott-Roth, former
aide to Representative Thomas Bliley, R-Va., chairman of the House
Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the panel is veteran commissioner Susan Ness, an
attorney and banker who is an FOH _ Friend of Hillary Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Gentrification? &LR;  Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park has been the
haunt of venture capitalists.
</P>
<P>
   Now, investment bankers are trading in San Francisco for what is
fast becoming the financial nerve center of Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes sense for us to be down here to be next to the VCs,''
said Rex Golding, who runs Morgan Stanley's technology group.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Koenig, who heads Goldman Sachs' technology practice is
also moving 80 bankers into a new office on Sand Hill. Frank
Quattrone's DMG Technology Group is already in Menlo Park, and
Merrill Lynch has an investment banking branch in Palo Alto.
</P>
<P>
   Other firms are said to be mulling similar moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be an investment banking ghetto by the time we're
finished,'' Golding joked.
</P>

SEN. FEINSTEIN WORKS TO SOLVE ENCRYPTION STANDOFF 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an effort to resolve bitter differences over
data encryption, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., brokered a
meeting Tuesday between several prominent high-tech executives and
top law enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   The closed-door discussion brought together for the first time
FBI Director Louis Freeh, Attorney General Janet Reno and such
high-tech leaders as Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates to review the
data-scrambling technology, which keeps computer communications
private.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh wants the FBI to be able to access encryption codes for
wire-tapping and other criminal investigations. The computer
industry contends that such efforts threaten privacy and free
speech.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration also wants to maintain controls over
exports of U.S. encryption technology. The industry argues that the
controls put U.S. companies at a competitive disadvantage, hamper
innovation and ultimately undermine their lead in technology.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein, a strong law-enforcement supporter, is the top
Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee's panel on technology,
terrorism and government information. Feinstein said in a statement
that she has ``developed a strong interest'' in encryption, and
that when she learned that Freeh ``had not had the opportunity to
talk directly with the CEOs of American high-tech companies
regarding his concerns,'' she offered to organize a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always believed that when there are areas of
disagreement, it is helpful to bring the principals together to
talk face to face,'' said Feinstein, for ``frank and informal
discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting allied Gates with some computer executives who have
frequently been his harshest critics _ Jim Barksdale, president of
Netscape; Scott McNealy, chief executive officer of Sun
Microsystems; and Eric Schmidt, chief executive officer of Novell _
as well as Steve Case, chief executive officer of America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Other law enforcement officials included Thomas Constantine,
head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Bobby Moody, president
of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, and William
Murphy, president of the National District Attorneys Association.
All declined to divulge details about the meeting.

U.S. AND INDUSTRY DISCUSS DATA ENCRYPTION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Leading computing executives, including Microsoft's
chief executive, Bill Gates, huddled for two hours on Tuesday with
Attorney General Janet Reno and the director of the FBI to discuss
disagreements between the industry and the government over data
scrambling.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, the White House said it hoped that the talks
would lead to an easing of export restrictions on data encryption
technology by fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The presence of industry leaders encourages us now to redouble
our efforts with industry,'' said a White House official who spoke
on the condition of anonymity. ``Without a solution, we risk losing
our lead in this important technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Any agreement ``must include further real relaxation in export
controls,'' the official said, adding: ``We are still discussing
exactly what those relaxations should be. That's the $64,000
question.''
</P>
<P>
   The executives who took part in the meeting at the office of
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., had little to say afterward. But
their very presence in one room was highly unusual _ a sign of just
how critical it has become for high-technology companies, privacy
advocates and the administration to resolve their years-long
stalemate on encryption.
</P>
<P>
   The United States currently prohibits, without special
permission, the export of strong encryption, a policy that even the
Clinton administration has acknowledged is hurting the dominance of
American encryption technology in the international marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   But the administration, under pressure from Louis Freeh, the FBI
director, has insisted that any easing of export controls be
coupled with creation of a system that guarantees law enforcement
quick access to encrypted files.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has been pushing for a third-party key recovery, or
``key escrow,'' system, that would essentially require anyone who
uses encryption to file a ``spare key'' for that data-scrambling
code with a company set up for that purpose. This method is
supposed to guarantee law-enforcement agencies access to encrypted
computer files in criminal investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Industry and privacy groups have balked at any third-party
recovery systems, a position that has stalled attempts to ease
export controls.

DEADLINES SET IN MICROSOFT ANTITRUST CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By MICHAEL PAULSON   
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Once again making it clear that he does not intend
to let the Microsoft antitrust case grow out of control, U.S.
District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson Tuesday set a series of
deadlines and limits on government and company attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson appeared to suggest that he believes the case of U.S.
vs. Microsoft should last about three weeks. He said he has set
aside the month of September for the trial, which is scheduled to
begin Sept. 8.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson also said he plans to allow each side to present no more
than 12 witnesses. The witnesses must be questioned in writing
prior to the trial, so that only cross-examination will be
conducted at trial.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, as well as attorneys on both sides, is clearly
mindful of the government's previous antitrust cases against IBM
and AT&AMP;T. The IBM case is now considered a model for judicial
inefficiency _ it stretched on for more than a decade, consuming
untold dollars and hours, before finally being dropped by the
government. And even the AT&AMP;T case involved scores of witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson is quickly setting a no-nonsense tone for this
proceeding, which is shaping up to be the most closely watched
anti-trust battle of the decade and a test of the judiciary's
ability to keep pace with technology.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government and the attorneys general of 20 states
and the District of Columbia are accusing Microsoft of illegally
seeking to expand a monopoly on computer operating systems into the
market for World Wide Web browsers. Microsoft denies that it has
done anything illegal.
</P>
<P>
   During a status hearing Tuesday, Jackson forbade the parties
from communicating with him except by formal motion, threatened to
appoint a special master if they get into spats over how to conduct
depositions, and refused to excuse Microsoft from filing a motion
it had tried to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to ``the high caliber of counsel we have in this
case,'' Jackson made it clear he expects the attorneys for the
company and the government to work together to make sure that each
side gets the information it needs to be ready for an on-time
trial.
</P>
<P>
   The goodwill between the sides seems somewhat limited, though.
At Tuesday's hearing Microsoft suggested the government should show
restraint in gathering evidence this summer because it has already
conducted a two-year investigation of the company. That prompted
the Justice Department's special trial counsel, David Boies,
alluding to the company's phenomenal wealth, to say ``I think
Microsoft clearly has the resources to respond to some discovery.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, however, appeared sympathetic to Microsoft, telling
Boies ``don't plow ground that you don't need to plow again.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides proclaimed themselves pleased with the hearing. Boies
said the government is pleased by the judge's commitment to hold an
unusually early and speedy trial, while Microsoft vice president
William Neukom said, ``We are pleased with the results of today's
hearing, and are looking forward to an opportunity to dispose of
this matter as quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Also this week, Microsoft filed a motion in court urging the
judge to keep under seal certain exhibits and other documents that
were filed by the government as part of its case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Microsoft documents in question detail Microsoft's
development and marketing plans for various Internet-related
technologies,'' Microsoft said in a motion. ``Unfettered disclosure
of such confidential documents to Netscape, Oracle, Sun
Microsystems and other Microsoft competitors would seriously
compromise Microsoft's important business interests.''
</P>
<P>
   The government disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There exists a strong presumption in favor of public access to
judicial proceedings,'' the Justice Department and the states wrote
in a joint brief. ``This (appeals court) circuit has stated that
`the courts are public institutions that best serve the public when
they do their business openly and in full view', and it recognizes
the importance of making court records accessible to the public,
especially when the government is a party to the lawsuit and
objects to the sealing of the records.''

Five young friends' dreams evolve into $11 million Interweb 
By Mike Williams  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Four years ago they were five young friends crowded
into a Midtown, Atlanta studio apartment, dreaming up big ideas for
a company that would capitalize on the hot new technology of the
day: the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   No matter that many businesses then barely knew what the
Internet was.
</P>
<P>
   No matter that none of the five had a degree in computer
science, and no venture capitalist would touch their proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, their fledgling company, Interweb, was bought by a
New York firm in a deal worth about $11 million in stock.
</P>
<P>
   Interweb _ now part of an Internet development firm called Think
New Ideas _ has become a national player in a rapidly-evolving
field revolutionizing the way American companies do business, from
tasks as mundane as ordering paper clips to inventory tracking,
sales, marketing and advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a history major who had been a stockbroker, an MBA who
had never run a company, and one guy with real world experience
with computers,'' said Will duPont, 30, Interweb's president. ``We
would go to meetings with potential customers and begin by
explaining what the Internet was.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a tool, and a toy
</P>
<P>
   Interweb's swift growth and the evolution of the services it
provides mirrors the Internet's explosive development. The computer
network has become a popular play thing for individuals and an
increasingly important tool for businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the statistics show huge growth in the use of the Web,''
said Michael Cummins, head of the Georgia Center for Advanced
Telecommunications Technology. ``It's reached critical mass and
it's going to get faster as we smooth out the bottlenecks.''
</P>
<P>
   Forrester Research of Boston estimates Web-related services,
sales and development could reach $2 billion this year, and $10
billion by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta has become a nexus for Web development firms serving the
Southeast, with more than 150 outfits listed in the Yellow Pages as
providing Internet services. They range from Mindspring, the
fast-growing Internet access provider, to Web development firms
like Interweb, Macquarium and iXL, to small shops that design home
pages for other small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   From an acorn grew a tree
</P>
<P>
   For all its founders' grand ideas, Interweb started small.
</P>
<P>
   The firm was the brainchild of Daniel Davenport and Paul Goggin,
who met through a mutual friend at Georgia Tech, where Goggin was a
graduate student in atmospheric chemistry. Goggin had the technical
know-how. Although not a computer major, he was helping run a
computer-based data system for the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency.
</P>
<P>
   He was also playing around a lot on the Internet, which was just
emerging into the public realm from its origins as a tool for the
Defense Department and university researchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could see the opportunities,'' said Goggin, 30. ``It was
really easy to use and yet so powerful. It was a great way for
getting access to information.''
</P>
<P>
   Over beers, Goggin and Davenport _ a philosophy major in college
_ tossed around ideas on how to build a business based around the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport drew in duPont, then a stockbroker who had been his
college roommate at the University of Georgia, and Nick Owen, a
high school friend who earned an MBA at Georgia and was in the
mortgage and real estate business. Gibson Fenning, another Georgia
grad and friend, was tapped, too. He was working in advertising and
was skilled with graphic design.
</P>
<P>
   They drew up a business plan and started shopping around for
capital. Paul Arne, a lawyer with Morris, Manning and Martin, was
one of their early contacts. ``It's a running joke with us now,''
he recalls from his first meeting with the group. ``They were all
young and none of them had any Internet experience at all. Their
technical person was running an air quality lab at Georgia Tech.
And all they wanted was a few hundred thousand dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Humble beginnings
</P>
<P>
   Venture capital was out of the question, but the partners
persevered. Arne put them in touch with an Internet access firm
that made available some of the equipment they needed at prices
they could afford.
</P>
<P>
   The partners hit up family and friends, took out a loan, and
managed to pool $85,000 in capital. Working out of duPont's
one-bedroom apartment, they were off.
</P>
<P>
   It was late 1994, and the Internet was suddenly the talk of the
national media, which promised the Web would revolutionize
everything from shopping and banking to business inventory, sales
and office management.
</P>
<P>
   At Interweb, the beginnings were decidedly less high-flying.
``Our first customer was a small record label that paid us $1,000
to design a Web site and $100 a month to maintain it,'' duPont
recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Other small jobs followed, and then their first big break: a
contract with Invesco, the mutual fund firm. Dozens of other Web
design firms had sprouted up around Atlanta, and the contract
brought credibility for the young firm.
</P>
<P>
   Interweb closed out 1995 with $194,000 in revenue. The only
employees were the five partners, who had managed to rent office
space and move out of duPont's apartment.
</P>
<P>
   The start of the good times
</P>
<P>
   Their next big break came in 1996. They had done small jobs for
BellSouth Corp., and put in a proposal when the telecommunications
giant wanted better coordination of its many divisions' Web sites.
Interweb's chief competition was an established company based in
California's Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were only five guys, but we were five guys who were less
than a mile away,'' duPont recalls. ``Our contact knew he could
call us and we'd be at BellSouth within 10 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   The contract came just as Owen got married _ a big, happy event
for the friends that suddenly became even bigger and happier.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hired our first employee right before the wedding, and by
the time I got back from my honeymoon, they had hired another,''
said Owen, 32. ``It was very exciting, but suddenly when we had
employees, it got a little scary.''
</P>
<P>
   The concerns dissolved in a haze of marathon work sessions and
constant meetings with BellSouth people. By the end of 1996,
Interweb had revenues of $1.2 million and 20 employees.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet and what companies wanted from it was changing
almost as fast as the tiny company.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, it was a big deal for a business just to have a
presence on the Web. A few let customers order products, make
complaints or ask for information. Most simply put out what in
essence were informational brochures.
</P>
<P>
   The Interweb partners knew they had to do more than just design
pretty home pages with colorful graphics.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, they bought Professional Web Applications, an Atlanta
firm specializing in software applications.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great fit,'' duPont said. ``They were only four guys
and they didn't have much front-office presence. But they were
writing dynamite software.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly Interweb was able to expand its services, targeting a
customer's in-house computer network or ``Intranet,'' helping trim
expenses by making in-house tasks more efficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of it is as mundane as ordering paper clips or updating
company software,'' Owen said. ``If you're a company with 5,000
employees and every time you need to update your software you have
to install it on 5,000 machines by hand, you can see the
efficiencies if you can suddenly do it with a few keystrokes on
your computer.''
</P>
<P>
   Interweb also customized an employee locator, a job-line and
employment application-managing system and a conference-room
scheduler for clients. All may seem unexciting, but they are
time-consuming tasks greatly simplified by using an in-house
computer system.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Interweb earned $2.7 million in revenues and had 45
employees.
</P>
<P>
   In for the full ride
</P>
<P>
   The sale to Think New Ideas consolidates the vision the partners
had for their firm, which was to remain on the cutting edge of
Internet development and evolution. All five plan to continue
working for the new firm, which has offices in Boston, Seattle, Los
Angeles and New York, as well as an Atlanta operation that will
move into Interweb's building.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is cashing out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too much fun,'' said Goggin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry is so young, the opportunity is so huge, we'd be
foolish to get out now,'' adds duPont.

Tech Tools: New computer brings enough pain to share 
By Jack Warner  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I'm writing this on my new 400-MHz computer, and I'm
not having as much fun as you might think.
</P>
<P>
   I have come to dread new computers. Used to be, getting a
computer was the most exciting thing in the world. I was like a kid
at Christmas. Now I'm like Scrooge. It's more work than it's worth.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what happens when a new computer arrives at my house:
</P>
<P>
   I shove my current computer to one side of the desk and set the
new one up on the other side. Nothing is hooked up but keyboard,
mouse and monitor. I've got to get a bunch of stuff from the old
computer onto the new one.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody sent me a gizmo to back up a computer using a VCR. I
haul it out and hook it up. It's complicated, and I think, although
I'm not sure, that I've got the right cables. Unless the VCR is
hooked to a television set, you can't tell what's going on.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, I set out to back up about 500 megs of files. It's
slow, folks. Takes all evening. At 1 a.m., I rewind and attempt a
playback. Nothing there. Wrong cables, I guess. One entire evening
shot.
</P>
<P>
   The next evening I decide to try another approach. From a dusty
corner of the bookcase, I haul an old copy of LapLink and install
it. The program promptly announces it's too old for this version of
Windows 95 and probably won't run right.
</P>
<P>
   It's right, it won't. But it seems to run fine in DOS. So I hook
the two computers up with the parallel cable provided and start
transferring. It's fast, and things go well. Another evening down
the drain, but with good results.
</P>
<P>
   The next evening, it's time to prepare my old computer to begin
the trickle-down process to my wife. Format the drives, reinstall
Windows 95, shove her current computer to one side of her desk, set
my old one up on the other side and repeat the previous evening.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is punctured by various alarms over whether she can
find the disks to reinstall this program or that program, whether
all of these files or those files have been successfully
transferred, and so forth. There is much gnashing of teeth and
pulling of hair.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is to wipe clean both of the fixed disks on her
old computer and prepare them for the trickle-down to my daughter,
and I suppose I'll have to prepare my daughter's current computer
to trickle down to my granddaughters.
</P>
<P>
   In the cobbler's house, you see, everyone wears shoes, but since
the cobbler is an expert on shoes, no one else need even bother to
learn how to tie their laces.
</P>
<P>
   All right, enough with the whining. I'm sure you all want to
know just how wonderful my new 400-MHz Gateway is.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's certainly very nice, but for those of us whose
demands are not great, I believe we have reached the outer limits
of performance.
</P>
<P>
   My old computer was a 200-MHz machine. The new one seems a
little faster on the Internet, but in running the programs I
normally use -- Microsoft Word, for instance -- there's scarcely a
difference.
</P>
<P>
   So if you are thinking of buying a new computer, and your needs
are not that great, I wouldn't spring for 400 MHz. I'd think along
the lines of 300, no more. Get 64 megs of RAM -- that'll probably
help more than extra processing speed.
</P>
<P>
   But really, I've hardly gotten to use the thing. I haven't run
any games on it. I haven't put any of the DVD stuff in the DVD
drive, chiefly because none of it interests me, but I will.
</P>
<P>
   Stay tuned, and feel my pain.

Just for Fun: Printer accepts images from digital camera 
By Yusuf Davis  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Canon's Digital Printer CD-200, which ships next
month, claims to be the industry's first color printer to accept
and print images directly from a digital camera's Compact Flash
card.
</P>
<P>
   Designed primarily for use with Canon digitals, this printer is
compatible with most digital cameras that use the CF card and that
use JPEG compression.
</P>
<P>
   Billed as a virtual ``digital darkroom,'' the CD-200 produces
4-by-6-inch glossy photo prints, without the need for a PC. Each
print costs less than $1 per copy and is delivered in about a
minute and a half.
</P>
<P>
   Compatible with PCs and Macs, the printer allows users to print
still images from TV programs, camcorders and other video sources.
It also allows images to be displayed on a TV monitor.
</P>
<P>
   The CD-200 has an estimated retail price of $699 and can be seen
at the company's Web site: http://www.ccsi.canon.com.
</P>
<P>
   More than a printer
</P>
<P>
   The Sharp UX-2200CM is a six-in-one color inkjet machine. The
company claims it's the world's first multifunctional device to
have infrared direct print and data transfer capability. That's a
fancy way of saying you can hook it up to your computer wirelessly.
</P>
<P>
   Designed for the small office/home office market, this
multifunction machine features a plain-paper fax, color printer,
scanner, copier, PC fax and phone in an affordable, compact unit.
</P>
<P>
   The printer produces documents in up to 600 dots per inch, at a
rate of up to three pages per minute. Like other multifunctions,
the real advantages are price and space consumption. The device
sells for a fraction of the cost of buying each unit individually
and takes up a fraction of the space of separate units.
</P>
<P>
   Build your dream home
</P>
<P>
   Bob Vila, America's favorite do-it-yourselfer, has teamed up
with Mindscape and the Learning Company to create a software tool
that will help users conceptualize, plan and build the home of
their dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Though designed primarily for new-home builders, the two-CD Bob
Vila's Home Design also offers hundreds of tips for remodeling and
adding to existing homes.
</P>
<P>
   This comprehensive program contains a suite of 2-D/3-D drafting
and drawing tools, an encyclopedia of more than 1,000 home plans,
animated tours, and video and audio tips from Vila. There are also
links to an ``Ask Bob'' Web site, where Vila or his staff will
answer e-mail questions on personal home design projects.
</P>
<P>
   With a library of blueprints, design symbols for interiors and
exteriors, and a roof editor for dormers, chimneys and skylights,
this program, which retails for $40, will help users plan in 2-D
and view in 3-D almost any home up to 30 stories.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, visit the Web site
http://www.learningco.com.
</P>
<P>
   Take a look at sound
</P>
<P>
   The Cosmic Shower is the '90s version of the Lava Lamp, only
better. Created for the Sharper Image by electronic artist Joseph
F. Lozowski, the Cosmic Shower is an interactive light sculpture
that responds to your voice, music or other room sounds.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-tall clear tube is zapped electronically to produce a
complex pattern of brilliant green arcs, which descend in
successive waves through multiple levels.
</P>
<P>
   Turn on the stereo and watch music become visible, as the light
patterns change with the tempo. Green spirals form and dissolve to
the beat, and twists and ripples of light dance through the tube,
from top to base, then in reverse.
</P>
<P>
   Users can vary the speed of the display over a wide range, from
slow for meditation and relaxation to fast for high-energy action,
or alter the light pattern and sound sensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   Designed for low energy consumption, the Cosmic Shower retails
for $299. To learn more, visit the Web site

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ American presidents don't often journey to the
world's poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, however, will see more of the developing
world this year than the most intrepid collegiate backpacker, with
no fewer than five major forays completed or planned into Africa,
Latin America, Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent and China,
where he goes later this month.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he brushes the dust of antiquity off his traveling
shoes at year's end, Clinton will have logged more than 70,000
miles on Air Force One to touch table with countries taking in some
3 billion people _ more than half of whom scrape by on a dollar a
day or less _ who spring from some of the oldest civilizations on
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   There's far more to the presidential wanderlust, however, than
ruminations on the past or alms for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   What Clinton's travels signal are the beginnings of an epic
realignment in U.S. relations with the developing world, whose
fortunes have become tied to the goals of U.S. policymakers and
corporate chiefs like never before.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly much of the change is being driven by commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The United States did a staggering $2 trillion worth of two-way
trade with the rest of the world last year. A large and growing
chunk of that was with developing countries, where hundreds of
American companies have wagered scores of billions of dollars on
future growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in human history, living standards for huge
populations have quadrupled or more in a single generation,''
Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers told a meeting of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) here last week. ``This is good
for many people _ and good for the size of the pie.''
</P>
<P>
   Far beyond the shift from aid to trade, however, the new
partnership between the United States and many of the world's
poorest nations is being shaped by sobering geo-strategic
realities.
</P>
<P>
   For whether the issue is the scourge of drugs or the roots of
war, the threat of terrorism or the spread of AIDS, the wealth of
nations, global environmental protection or the harrowing specter
of nuclear Armageddon, it is becoming increasingly clear that the
United States can no longer control its own destiny _ much less
events beyond its borders _ solely in concert with its traditional
allies among the world's wealthy, democratic nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't get real cooperation from countries that are not
in that privileged club, we're not going to have a dramatic
impact,'' said Antony Blinken(CQ), senior director for strategic
planning at the White House National Security Council. ``As
powerful as we are, we just don't run the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was rudely reminded of that just last week, when he went
to the United Nations to plead with Mexico and its neighbors to
stop ``pointing fingers'' at the United States in the pitched
diplomatic dispute over how best to combat the illicit narcotics
trade.
</P>
<P>
   Setting aside the public tiff, the White House readily concedes
that it needs Mexico's help in combating illicit drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't buy into the process of trying to solve this
problem,'' said Blinken, ``we can't do it on our own.''
</P>
<P>
   Seldom have the limits of U.S. influence been more vividly
displayed than they were on June 3. In the sun-dappled splendor of
the White House Rose Garden, President Clinton formally dispatched
his top diplomat to Geneva to huddle with her counterparts from
Britain, China, Russia and France over how best to staunch a
mounting nuclear arms race between Pakistan and India, both of
which repeatedly tested nuclear weapons this spring over Clinton's
fervent objections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will do my very best for the president and the American
people,'' Secretary of State Madeleine Albright dutifully pledged.
</P>
<P>
   ``But do not make a mistake,'' she warned darkly. ``The risks of
the moment are high, and, for the moment, the key choices will be
made in New Delhi and Islamabad. We must all hope and pray those
choices are the right ones.''
</P>
<P>
   As necessity bears invention, so has nuclear saber-rattling
forced U.S. policymakers to finally take seriously a conflict that
has burned for decades in the disputed province of Kashmir, where
thousands of Indians and Pakistanis have been killed in gnawing
sectarian violence that has pushed the two countries toward the
brink of apocalypse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must begin to focus on the heart of the India-Pakistan
conflict _ Kashmir,'' an invigorated Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan.,
cautioned earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not only talking about the fate of a disputed state in
the Himalayas,'' said Brownback, chairman of the Near Eastern and
South Asian Affairs Subcommittee, ``we're talking about the
national security interests of the United Sates and its allies and,
indeed, the rest of the world in averting war.''
</P>
<P>
   If the nuclear threat tends to focus policymakers, recent
conventional conflicts in places like Rwanda, Somalia, Haiti and
Bosnia have already proven the dangers that regional animosities
pose to the major powers.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union loosed the Cold War
structures that framed the world for half a century, it has been
the troubles of such lesser states, far more than the jousting of
geopolitical giants, that have disrupted the post Cold War peace.
</P>
<P>
   It's a trend many analysts expect to persist.
</P>
<P>
   ``The primary security concerns are going to be in the
developing countries, and the U.S. has to realign its strategic
thinking,'' said John Echeverri-Gent, professor of international
political economy at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville.
``Not only will that mean new military strategy, but, hopefully, it
means new diplomatic strategy as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Development experts like Echeverri-Gent, naturally enough, have
been proselytizing for decades about the need to take seriously the
interests of the world's pitiably poor.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, it's technology, markets and realpolitik, not
altruism, that have linked the interests of wealthy nations
inextricably with those of the developing world.
</P>
<P>
   It's a sharp turnaround from decades of neo-colonialism, when
U.S. policymakers contented themselves with treating much of the
developing world primarily as a source of cheap raw materials and
labor, an emerging market for American goods and services or as a
chessboard for playing out the geopolitical stakes of the major
powers.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, in the world of the Internet A-bomb and sarin gas; a
place where an AIDS epidemic in Uganda is just a plane flight away
from New York; where dollar-an-hour workers in a Juarez suburb
compete head on with the breadwinner of a family in St. Louis;
where a crack addict on the streets of Chicago can feed a ravenous
crime ring in Colombia; and where missile parts shipped from China
can enable Pakistan to target India with a nuclear bomb; the
developing world's prospects, for better and for worse, pose real
and immediate challenges for the United States and its allies.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are things that have zero respect for borders,'' said
Blinken. ``A problem that starts at one end of the global village
can become a plague on everyone's house much more quickly than
before, so it requires us to work more closely with these people
than ever before.''
</P>
<P>
   Air Force One helps. And yet, presidential visits are only the
visible tip of the enormous working-level activity such engagement
spawns between countries.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's trip to China, for instance _ the first such visit by
a sitting American president since Beijing's bloody crackdown nine
years ago on democracy advocates near Tiananmen Square _ only
symbolizes his broader policy of working with, rather than
isolating, Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   He buttressed that approach on June 3 by renewing China's most
favored nation (MFN) trading status, over the objections of many on
Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   In taking the controversial step, Clinton praised China's
efforts to help defuse the nuclear crisis between India and
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is further evidence of the important role China can play
in meeting the challenges of the 21st Century,'' said Clinton.
``This is an important example of how our engagement with China
serves America's interests _ stability in Asia, preventing the
spread of weapons of mass destruction, combating international
crime and drug trafficking, protecting the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's ringing endorsement conveniently overlooked the vital
role China played in assisting Pakistan's nuclear weapons quest.
</P>
<P>
   Critics point to Clinton's China policy as an example of U.S.
foreign policy toward developing nations being dominated by the
interests of U.S. companies, which have invested $17.3 billion in
China to date and have signed contracts to invest $23 billion more.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   As U.S. relations with much of the developing world were held
hostage by Cold War concerns, so today, critics allege, is U.S.
policy toward poorer countries largely a captive of the Fortune
500.
</P>
<P>
   In search of cheap labor and growing markets, American
companies, abetted by Washington, are shaking hands and cutting
deals with some of the most repressive regimes anywhere on Earth _
Vietnam, Indonesia, Nigeria and Saudi Arabia among them.
</P>
<P>
   The White House counters that liberal thought and democracy will
naturally flow from open markets and the resultant rise of a middle
class.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't yet worked in China, where markets have been opening
for two decades, the middle class now tops 150 million and the
political system remains one of the most harshly repressive
anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's this view in the political world, and the academic
world, that all one needs to do is open up commercial relations and
favorable political relations will follow in the wake,'' said
Jeffrey Winters, professor of political economy at Northwestern
University in Evanston, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact of the matter is that democratization comes when
people struggle for it,'' said Winters. ``The markets don't do this
automatically.''
</P>
<P>
   Winters said he would prefer to see the White House impose harsh
economic sanctions on countries that don't move in the direction of
democratization and respect for human rights.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has imposed sanctions on a long list of
developing countries, including Libya, Iran, Iraq and, most
recently, Pakistan and India. In each case, though, it has been
security concerns, not human rights violations, that have prompted
the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day, said the National Security Council's
Blinken, it is by working with developing countries, far more than
by trying to squeeze them, that U.S. influence will ultimately be
leveraged.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a lot of these countries there is a tide of history that's
moving very, very hard against dictatorship or repressive leaders
that don't fulfill the rights or demands of their people,'' said
Blinken. ``What we can do is try to get things to move in the right
direction.''

Mac News: Bargain program handles personal information well 
By Charles Haddad  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A program called Consultant is the best new personal
information manager to hit the Mac market in years -- and it's a
heck of a good deal, too.
</P>
<P>
   For about $50, you get a calendar and electronic card file
largely the equal of programs costing twice as much. And, in some
cases, it's easier to use and more attractive.
</P>
<P>
   What's the catch? You can only buy Consultant over the telephone
or the Internet, which eliminates the cost of expensive packaging,
shipping and marketing. That's why the program is so inexpensive.
</P>
<P>
   Consultant is representative of a larger trend in software. The
Internet is becoming the distributor of choice for software
developers, who are increasingly trying to entice customers to buy
online rather than in stores.
</P>
<P>
   For Mac developers, this trend is particularly important. Most
stores carry little if any Mac software. Not surprisingly, sales of
Mac software are continuing to fall, and developers are struggling.
They are desperate for ways to cut costs, and the Internet is one
way to do it.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how Consultant is distributed, it would be a good
piece of software. It's sharply rendered and attractive. The
program is also responsive and offers some novel twists on features
common in other personal information managers.
</P>
<P>
   Consultant, though, does have its weaknesses. For one, the
program won't let you save searches and sorted information. That
means there's no way to save a list of frequently consulted
contacts. This is a standard feature in most personal information
managers.
</P>
<P>
   Consultant also has no printed manual. Like a growing number of
programs, it has eliminated a manual to save costs. But Consultant,
unlike many other programs, does have excellent help within the
program. There's even more help available on its Web site and in an
electronic manual, which you can download.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Consultant works like most personal information
managers. It has a calendar with multiple views, a to-do list, an
address book and a memo writer.
</P>
<P>
   It also lets you link contacts, notes and documents outside the
program to a to-do or appointment -- all standard stuff today. What
makes Consultant special is some novel twists on these common
features. Take its translate button.
</P>
<P>
   Click the button, type ``meet Bob for lunch at noon Friday'' and
Consultant will turn it into an appointment on that day.
</P>
<P>
   Consultant also offers strong word processing features. You can
keep a daily journal and write memos and notes. Memos can be
formatted like text in any word processor, changing fonts, rulers,
etc. You can also save templates for things such as faxes and
letters.
</P>
<P>
   Consultant is published by Chronos L.C. You'll find the program
on the company's first-rate Web site, at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .chronosnet.com. Chronos will let you download a trial copy of
its program. Or you can order Consultant on CD by calling
801-957-1774.

Cyberscene: Free, shareware programs can enhance Net experience 
By Bill Husted  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Internet is truly a wonderful and mysterious
place. Besides offering information on how to do anything from bake
a cake to get rid of fleas, it's also the world's biggest source of
both free and inexpensive computer programs.
</P>
<P>
   In just a few hours, you can get dozens of programs that will
help you use the Internet more efficiently. Even if your current
Internet provider included free Web browsing, e-mail and newsgroup
software, there are still plenty of programs that will save you
time and frustration.
</P>
<P>
   We'll start with Net.Medic. It gives an accurate reading of your
connection speed. Most folks don't understand that modems
constantly adjust in speed, based on line conditions. So, just
because you logged on at, say, 26k bps, that doesn't mean you'll be
operating at that speed later.
</P>
<P>
   You can get a free demonstration version of this software at
http://www.vitalsigns.com
</P>
<P>
   /product/download.html.
</P>
<P>
   Are you still using the e-mail program built into your Web
browser? If you are, you can make sending and receiving e-mail
(especially when files are attached to the e-mail you get) easier
by using Eudora Lite, a free version of Eudora Pro.
</P>
<P>
   Just set your browser for http://eudora.qualcomm.com
</P>
<P>
   /freeware/. You'll find versions of this program for both
Windows and Macintosh machines.
</P>
<P>
   Virus protection is increasingly important. But there's no real
need to buy a commercial anti-virus program. There are excellent
anti-virus programs available free or as shareware (where you
download the program and use it free and only pay if you find it
useful). Payment is on the honor system, and the fee is usually
much less than you'd pay for a program that you'd buy in a store.
</P>
<P>
   You can read about several of these programs -- in a list that
includes both shareware and free programs -- at http://tucows
</P>
<P>
   .pcihost.com/virus95.html.
</P>
<P>
   The next program is one most Internet providers hate. You'll
have to let your conscience be your guide here, so I'll tell you
how the program works and you decide if you'd like to try it.
</P>
<P>
   Some Internet providers automatically disconnect you after a
certain number of minutes if you aren't sending e-mail, browsing
the Web or downloading programs. The trouble with that is some
providers also disconnect you when you're actually using the Net
but just not sending or receiving information.
</P>
<P>
   There's software around that fools computers and the provider
into thinking you're actively using the computer. That way, you
don't get disconnected. You can get one of these programs at
http://tucows.pcihost.com
</P>
<P>
   /discon95.html.
</P>
<P>
   One of the problems with writing a column like this is knowing
what programs you need and use. Some folks could profit by a better
newsgroup reader; others need to find a new browser or a File
Transfer Protocol program that does a better job of downloading
than when you use a browser.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, there are sites that offer entire menus of downloads
--almost every program you can imagine for using the Internet. One
of these sites is called Stroud's Consummate Winsock Applications
and can be found at http://cws.internet.com/.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you never download a single program there, you'll learn
a lot about the Internet and the possibilities that it offers by
simply browsing the descriptions of what is available. You may find
just the thing to solve a problem you have.

Motorola's severace package revealed to Austin employees 
By Omar L. Gallaga  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Motorola Inc. gave preliminary details about a
voluntary severance package to employees recently, the first step
in slashing 15,000 jobs, or 10 percent of its workforce.
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, where the company has about 10,000 employees, workers
received an e-mail about the package.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola will make the severance package available to employees
whose age and years of experience at the company add up to 75.
Employees who opt to receive the package will receive a week's pay
for every year of service and other benefits depending on their
length of service.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola spokesman Scott Stevens said the company is asking
eligible employees to decide whether they want to take the package
by the end of June.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the restructuring, Motorola has said it will
consolidate its semiconductor manufacturing and its messaging,
information and media businesses. Poorly performing businesses will
be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   The company blamed pricing pressures and a weak Asian economy
for slow revenue growth and what it says will be
lower-than-expected earnings this quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Lonnie Hurst, a spokesman for Motorola's Austin operations, said
for the next week and a half, teams at Motorola will meet to
discuss cost cutting. So far, no specific job cuts have been
announced, Hurst said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's interested in how Austin's going to be impacted,''
he said. ``We don't have all the answers today, but we're putting
together plans to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Austin is home to Motorola's Semiconductor Products Sector, one
division of Motorola that was targeted in Thursday's announcement
for consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   While cuts are expected in SPS, which employs most of Austin's
Motorola workers, Hurst said the company is still hiring engineers
and focusing on expansion plans for some of its operations.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ American presidents don't often journey to the
world's poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, however, will see more of the developing
world this year than the most intrepid collegiate backpacker, with
no fewer than five major forays completed or planned into Africa,
Latin America, Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent and China,
where he goes later this month.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he brushes the dust of antiquity off his traveling
shoes at year's end, Clinton will have logged more than 70,000
miles on Air Force One to touch table with countries taking in some
3 billion people _ more than half of whom scrape by on a dollar a
day or less _ who spring from some of the oldest civilizations on
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   There's far more to the presidential wanderlust, however, than
ruminations on the past or alms for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   What Clinton's travels signal are the beginnings of an epic
realignment in U.S. relations with the developing world, whose
fortunes have become tied to the goals of U.S. policymakers and
corporate chiefs like never before.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly much of the change is being driven by commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The United States did a staggering $2 trillion worth of two-way
trade with the rest of the world last year. A large and growing
chunk of that was with developing countries, where hundreds of
American companies have wagered scores of billions of dollars on
future growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in human history, living standards for huge
populations have quadrupled or more in a single generation,''
Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers told a meeting of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) here last week. ``This is good
for many people _ and good for the size of the pie.''
</P>
<P>
   Far beyond the shift from aid to trade, however, the new
partnership between the United States and many of the world's
poorest nations is being shaped by sobering geo-strategic
realities.
</P>
<P>
   For whether the issue is the scourge of drugs or the roots of
war, the threat of terrorism or the spread of AIDS, the wealth of
nations, global environmental protection or the harrowing specter
of nuclear Armageddon, it is becoming increasingly clear that the
United States can no longer control its own destiny _ much less
events beyond its borders _ solely in concert with its traditional
allies among the world's wealthy, democratic nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't get real cooperation from countries that are not
in that privileged club, we're not going to have a dramatic
impact,'' said Antony Blinken(CQ), senior director for strategic
planning at the White House National Security Council. ``As
powerful as we are, we just don't run the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was rudely reminded of that just last week, when he went
to the United Nations to plead with Mexico and its neighbors to
stop ``pointing fingers'' at the United States in the pitched
diplomatic dispute over how best to combat the illicit narcotics
trade.
</P>
<P>
   Setting aside the public tiff, the White House readily concedes
that it needs Mexico's help in combating illicit drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't buy into the process of trying to solve this
problem,'' said Blinken, ``we can't do it on our own.''
</P>
<P>
   Seldom have the limits of U.S. influence been more vividly
displayed than they were on June 3. In the sun-dappled splendor of
the White House Rose Garden, President Clinton formally dispatched
his top diplomat to Geneva to huddle with her counterparts from
Britain, China, Russia and France over how best to staunch a
mounting nuclear arms race between Pakistan and India, both of
which repeatedly tested nuclear weapons this spring over Clinton's
fervent objections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will do my very best for the president and the American
people,'' Secretary of State Madeleine Albright dutifully pledged.
</P>
<P>
   ``But do not make a mistake,'' she warned darkly. ``The risks of
the moment are high, and, for the moment, the key choices will be
made in New Delhi and Islamabad. We must all hope and pray those
choices are the right ones.''
</P>
<P>
   As necessity bears invention, so has nuclear saber-rattling
forced U.S. policymakers to finally take seriously a conflict that
has burned for decades in the disputed province of Kashmir, where
thousands of Indians and Pakistanis have been killed in gnawing
sectarian violence that has pushed the two countries toward the
brink of apocalypse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must begin to focus on the heart of the India-Pakistan
conflict _ Kashmir,'' an invigorated Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan.,
cautioned earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not only talking about the fate of a disputed state in
the Himalayas,'' said Brownback, chairman of the Near Eastern and
South Asian Affairs Subcommittee, ``we're talking about the
national security interests of the United Sates and its allies and,
indeed, the rest of the world in averting war.''
</P>
<P>
   If the nuclear threat tends to focus policymakers, recent
conventional conflicts in places like Rwanda, Somalia, Haiti and
Bosnia have already proven the dangers that regional animosities
pose to the major powers.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union loosed the Cold War
structures that framed the world for half a century, it has been
the troubles of such lesser states, far more than the jousting of
geopolitical giants, that have disrupted the post Cold War peace.
</P>
<P>
   It's a trend many analysts expect to persist.
</P>
<P>
   ``The primary security concerns are going to be in the
developing countries, and the U.S. has to realign its strategic
thinking,'' said John Echeverri-Gent, professor of international
political economy at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville.
``Not only will that mean new military strategy, but, hopefully, it
means new diplomatic strategy as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Development experts like Echeverri-Gent, naturally enough, have
been proselytizing for decades about the need to take seriously the
interests of the world's pitiably poor.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, it's technology, markets and realpolitik, not
altruism, that have linked the interests of wealthy nations
inextricably with those of the developing world.
</P>
<P>
   It's a sharp turnaround from decades of neo-colonialism, when
U.S. policymakers contented themselves with treating much of the
developing world primarily as a source of cheap raw materials and
labor, an emerging market for American goods and services or as a
chessboard for playing out the geopolitical stakes of the major
powers.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, in the world of the Internet A-bomb and sarin gas; a
place where an AIDS epidemic in Uganda is just a plane flight away
from New York; where dollar-an-hour workers in a Juarez suburb
compete head on with the breadwinner of a family in St. Louis;
where a crack addict on the streets of Chicago can feed a ravenous
crime ring in Colombia; and where missile parts shipped from China
can enable Pakistan to target India with a nuclear bomb; the
developing world's prospects, for better and for worse, pose real
and immediate challenges for the United States and its allies.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are things that have zero respect for borders,'' said
Blinken. ``A problem that starts at one end of the global village
can become a plague on everyone's house much more quickly than
before, so it requires us to work more closely with these people
than ever before.''
</P>
<P>
   Air Force One helps. And yet, presidential visits are only the
visible tip of the enormous working-level activity such engagement
spawns between countries.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's trip to China, for instance _ the first such visit by
a sitting American president since Beijing's bloody crackdown nine
years ago on democracy advocates near Tiananmen Square _ only
symbolizes his broader policy of working with, rather than
isolating, Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   He buttressed that approach on June 3 by renewing China's most
favored nation (MFN) trading status, over the objections of many on
Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   In taking the controversial step, Clinton praised China's
efforts to help defuse the nuclear crisis between India and
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is further evidence of the important role China can play
in meeting the challenges of the 21st Century,'' said Clinton.
``This is an important example of how our engagement with China
serves America's interests _ stability in Asia, preventing the
spread of weapons of mass destruction, combating international
crime and drug trafficking, protecting the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's ringing endorsement conveniently overlooked the vital
role China played in assisting Pakistan's nuclear weapons quest.
</P>
<P>
   Critics point to Clinton's China policy as an example of U.S.
foreign policy toward developing nations being dominated by the
interests of U.S. companies, which have invested $17.3 billion in
China to date and have signed contracts to invest $23 billion more.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   As U.S. relations with much of the developing world were held
hostage by Cold War concerns, so today, critics allege, is U.S.
policy toward poorer countries largely a captive of the Fortune
500.
</P>
<P>
   In search of cheap labor and growing markets, American
companies, abetted by Washington, are shaking hands and cutting
deals with some of the most repressive regimes anywhere on Earth _
Vietnam, Indonesia, Nigeria and Saudi Arabia among them.
</P>
<P>
   The White House counters that liberal thought and democracy will
naturally flow from open markets and the resultant rise of a middle
class.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't yet worked in China, where markets have been opening
for two decades, the middle class now tops 150 million and the
political system remains one of the most harshly repressive
anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's this view in the political world, and the academic
world, that all one needs to do is open up commercial relations and
favorable political relations will follow in the wake,'' said
Jeffrey Winters, professor of political economy at Northwestern
University in Evanston, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact of the matter is that democratization comes when
people struggle for it,'' said Winters. ``The markets don't do this
automatically.''
</P>
<P>
   Winters said he would prefer to see the White House impose harsh
economic sanctions on countries that don't move in the direction of
democratization and respect for human rights.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has imposed sanctions on a long list of
developing countries, including Libya, Iran, Iraq and, most
recently, Pakistan and India. In each case, though, it has been
security concerns, not human rights violations, that have prompted
the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day, said the National Security Council's
Blinken, it is by working with developing countries, far more than
by trying to squeeze them, that U.S. influence will ultimately be
leveraged.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a lot of these countries there is a tide of history that's
moving very, very hard against dictatorship or repressive leaders
that don't fulfill the rights or demands of their people,'' said
Blinken. ``What we can do is try to get things to move in the right
direction.''

Samsung stops chip production to raise worldwide prices 
By Omar L. Gallaga  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Samsung Austin Semiconductor said its production
would not be affected by a plan by South Korean parent Samsung
Electronics Co. to temporarily stop production on memory chips.
</P>
<P>
   Samsung Electronics, the world's largest maker of memory chips,
said recently it was stopping production in its factories for a
week to combat a worldwide glut in memory chips that have dropped
prices on the products.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Cryer, a spokesman for Samsung Austin, said the company's
$1.3 billion memory production plant in Northeast Austin would not
be part of the work stoppage. ``We're still moving into our second
phase of production and we're ramping up here,'' Cryer said. ``We
will continue that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Austin plant is scheduled to reach full capacity by late
summer or early fall, he said, producing 64-megabit DRAMs for
customers including Dell Computer Corp. and Compaq Computer Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Cryer said some of the chips that are produced in Austin may be
held up at packaging plants in Korea, but that memory chips will be
received by Samsung's clients on time. ``They have made provisions
to make sure that all of our customers will be getting chips on
schedule,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Samsung Electronics' announcement came less than a week after
Hyundai Electronics Co., South Korea's second-largest producer of
memory chips, suspended production for seven days.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies have cited falling memory prices and
overproduction for their production halts. But while the companies
are counting on cutting back supplies of chips to spur demand,
Bruce Bonner, an analyst at research firm Dataquest, said the
production suspensions may not have the desired effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something that happened just about the same time last
year,'' Bonner said. ``They've tried to do this before without
success. In the short term, it looks good because they get higher
prices. But prices will eventually drop and go back to where they
would have been in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Dataquest, prices have fallen about 25 to 30
percent in the last five weeks for 16-megabit and 64-megabit DRAMs.
South Korean companies Samsung, Hyundai and LG Semicon account for
about 40 percent of the world's memory chip production. This
article includes material from The Associated Press.

TALES OF AN INTERNET ENTREPRENEUR
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For a quick and enjoyable read about life as an
Internet entrepreneur, check out Michael Wolff's ``Burn Rate: How I
Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The term burn rate refers to how fast a company is ``burning''
its capital. On the Internet, where most companies seem better at
spending money than making it, burn rate determines how long your
company has to live. To Wolff's mind, the term also implies that,
sooner or later, everyone gets burned on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Wolff, a former journalist, got into the Internet entrepreneur
business almost by accident. His small publishing company created
popular books such as ``NetGuide'' and NetBooks, then branched into
related online products.
</P>
<P>
   Those products made his company an attractive partner for the
Internet's major players, who at the time were hungering for
content to draw customers. By the time Wolff's particular dance
with the big dogs was over, he had made a little money, spent a
lot, lost his company and gained a great deal of wisdom about
Internet business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet would defeat everybody _ except the very, very
quickest to alight and then be gone,'' Wolff writes. ``It was a
speeded-up version of culture itself, a series of fads and trends
mixing with social and historical and economic forces and
technological advances and roiled by constant upheaval and sudden
reversals. Maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   For a taste of Wolff's brisk style, check out the excerpt in the
latest issue of Wired magazine, which describes a failed merger
deal almost chilling in the cold-blooded power plays of the
investment bankers involved.
</P>
<P>
   But the rest of the book is worth a read, too, with some
interesting perspectives on America Online as chat-porn megasite
and Microsoft as clueless 800-pound gorilla. And not only does
www.burnrate.com include more information about the 268-page book
and related links, it also includes the book's index.
</P>
<P>
   ``Burn Rate'' is published by one of those stuffy old-media
companies, Simon &AMP; Schuster, and costs $25.
</P>
<P>
   Being a computer user often means swimming in an alphabet soup
of acronyms, but here's one PC and Mac lovers alike probably will
get to know well soon: USB.
</P>
<P>
   It stands for Universal Serial Bus, and is a fairly new
technology that replaces the various parallel, serial, SCSI, ADB
and other ports that connect Macs and PCs with everything from
keyboards to modems to hard drives. Though USB has been around for
more than a year, it's not been widely used in existing computers.
</P>
<P>
   Expect that to change this summer. The soon-to-be-released
Windows 98 will include USB as a native part of its code, unlike in
Windows 95, which should dramatically improve the notoriously balky
software problems that have bedeviled the bus.
</P>
<P>
   And Apple Computer's nifty new iMac, to be released in August,
will be the first Macintosh to use the more flexible USB interface
on that platform, further expanding the market.
</P>
<P>
   The next step will be for peripheral makers to finish converting
their products to the new connection. Companies have been reluctant
to do so, given the reliability problems and smaller markets, but
this summer's changes could push USB-based products into wider
availability.
</P>
<P>
   And with a connection that works on both PCs and Macs, without
the need for adapters or other gimmicks, everyone should benefit
from cheaper prices. Hurrah for that.
</P>
<P>
   The buzz is big over ``Unreal,'' the new computer shoot-'em-up
from Epic Megagames and GT Interactive that just came out to
huzzahs all around the videogaming biz.
</P>
<P>
   But get this: To really appreciate the amazing effects and look
of the game, you need not one, but two 3-D graphics cards in your
computer, said Bill Paris, a writer with Next Generation and Play
Station magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how you make the cards work together, but if you
saw it, it'd be worth it,'' Paris raved. ``You'd want to go out and
get another card, just to get the full effect.''
</P>
<P>
   The game's arrival at Imagine Publishing, whose several computer
publications include both that employ Paris, has virtually blotted
out interest in any other games among the many hard-core players
there, Paris said.
</P>
<P>
   It had to happen, given the nationwide fervor inspired by Beanie
Babies. Now there's a ``complete unauthorized guide on CD-ROM''
called the ``Ultimate Collector for Beanie Babies.'' Blame
Palladium Interactive for this one.
</P>
<P>
   The disk includes just about every smidgen of information a
collector of the little beanbag animals could want, including
variations on the toys' tags, the poem accompanying each type of
toy, their release and retirement dates, item number and value (one
1995 horse Beanie is valued at $4,000, it says), as well as
pictures of the pets.
</P>
<P>
   The database will calculate such things as the value of a
collection, and allow you to track purchases, trades and sales as
you enter your acquisitions into the program.
</P>
<P>
   It also gives you access to a special World Wide Web site that
regularly updates the database's figures. For more information,
contact www.palladium.net, which is Palladium's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, the disk provides WAY more beanie than this baby can
handle. But then again, I'm not the one buying five Happy Meals at
McDonald's to score more Teenie Beanies. There's no explaining the
heart of the collector.

<P>
   GUO YUAN, China _ Gazing down over green rice shoots that
forever have been the Chinese peasant's sweaty handhold on life,
Zhan Hanjuin couldn't dismiss the broad grin that had played across
his face all afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard for him still to believe he was standing atop his
own new, two-story house with a fish pond on the roof, a Volkswagen
Santana in the garage, and a six-foot-high air-conditioner in the
parlor.
</P>
<P>
   Just 25 years ago, Zhan and his new bride shared a house with
his parents, two brothers and their families. They worked on a
collective farm and didn't have electricity, much less electronics
like the television and stereo ornamenting Zhan's year-old house.
</P>
<P>
   Zhan, 48, is a top-of-the-line ``peasant.''
</P>
<P>
   But millions of Chinese families have pulled themselves out of
exhausting poverty since land reform began handing them control of
China's rice paddies and grain fields in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peasants can arrange their work and living schedule on their
own,'' he told a visitor. ``In their spare time they have the
freedom to look for opportunities to earn a lot of money. It's up
to them to decide.''
</P>
<P>
   About 50 million mostly rural Chinese remain overwhelmed by the
deepest poverty, according to government statistics, but that is
dramatically less than the 250 million registered in 1978. Back
then the Zhan family was among the poor.
</P>
<P>
   The grain farmers of northern China accrue less from reform than
farmers in this south-central rice bowl, where tiny plots of land
give lucrative yields. Yet peasants throughout the country are
seeing lifestyle improvements at the very time urban workers are
suffering from growing unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   An early summer ride through Hunan Province shows what that
means in the rice paddies patchworking the countryside.
</P>
<P>
   The brilliantly verdant landscape is flecked everywhere with
two-story homes faced in the same white, brick-sized tiles that
cover Zhan's house, with the same smoked-glass windows battling the
sun. Some tiled roofs make orange-red splashes on the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Many are additions built onto older adobe or concrete slab
buildings, and many are still under construction. The majority of
peasants in Hunan Province, population 62 million, look to be
living in spacious, if rather basic, comfort.
</P>
<P>
   How to explain this agriculture success story, when the other
giant of collective farms _ Russia _ has been almost totally unable
to retreat from the communist style of communal farm work and
continues to experience a draining slump in output?
</P>
<P>
   The biggest difference is that China eliminated collectives and
divided the land among families. Chinese farmers don't have full
ownership, since they cannot sell, develop or lease the land
allotted them. But the crops are theirs to keep or sell. And they
expect their grandchildren to farm the same fields.
</P>
<P>
   Except at a few experimental sites, Russia did not divide its
farm land. So farmers still assume no individual responsibility for
their work, in either success or failure.
</P>
<P>
   Differences in the nature of soil and crops make independent
farming more difficult in Russia, and so far the nation and its
farmers have been unwilling even to attempt broad-based farming
outside the village-centered group.
</P>
<P>
   In Hunan Province today, 70 percent of the farmers no longer
live in poverty, said Wu Heqing, a province spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today peasants spend 25 percent of the time they used to
(spend) farming the land,'' said Wu. ``Now they have incentives to
work, because they get everything they grow. And now they can
engage in business in their free time. That used to be
prohibited.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the collective system, peasants were paid according to the
number of days they spent in the fields. Working slowly was to
their advantage _ the more days worked, the more compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Now farmers get in and out of the fields at full tilt, so they
can make money working in small factories or running their own
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The Guo Yuan Township Vehicle and Parts Factory molded itself
seamlessly to the changes. Employing 43 people when it started
producing small tools and plows in 1971, the enterprise now has 700
to 1,400 workers hammering together bright blue farm trucks
increasingly in demand as agriculture prospers.
</P>
<P>
   The primitive factory lacks conveyors or safety gear, but plant
director Jiang Yitian said the factory rolls out about 10,000
trucks a year. He finds the cyclical nature of farm work compatible
with the up-and-down demand for trucks. Both require part-time
workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we have orders they come to work. Then when they're free
they go back to the land,'' Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
   His factory hands earn an average of 500 yuan ($60) a month,
about as much as low-end urban workers. This usually supplements a
family's farm income.
</P>
<P>
   It is China's dense, double-crop cultivation of rice that has
enabled farmers here to prosper even with land allotments that seem
incredibly small.
</P>
<P>
   The dirt road leading back to Huang Jianxia's place, for
example, passes a rice paddy so tiny that it looks scarcely big
enough to feed his family a year of dinners.
</P>
<P>
   Yet with three of those small fields called mu -- each mu is
about one-sixth of an acre -- Huang manages harvests totalling more
than four tons of rice every year. Adding the income from the pigs
his wife raises, this becomes another ``peasant'' family that no
longer qualifies for the moniker.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past we got only 600 kilograms (1,320 pounds) of rice
for each mu we farmed,'' said Huang, 45.
</P>
<P>
   The quality of seed has improved, machines are available for
land preparation, and chemical fertilizer has replaced the human
and pig manure that farmers used to spread on the paddies, he
explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before it took five or six months to work the fields. Now it
only takes two months,'' Huang said. ``The skills have changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Huang also is a carpenter, though he said selling his tables and
doors and beds is harder these days since neighbors buy so cheaply
in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his family income averages 1,500 to 1,660 yuan a month,
or about $180 to $200. Though low by Western standards, 1,500 yuan
a month is an enviable wage in China.
</P>
<P>
   Recent government statistics show that even in the biggest
cities only 8 percent of the workers earn 1,500 yuan or more.
Workers at Delphi China's Shanghai factory, for example, average
1,000 yuan a month.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials described Huang's household as about median
income for province farmers, and this tallied with observations
during a two-day visit to the Hunan countryside.
</P>
<P>
   His quarters aren't as lavish as those of the Zhan family, but
Huang, his wife and 16-year-old son enjoy a comfortably large house
with spare furniture, a television, refrigerator, ceiling fan and
perhaps most importantly an electric pump that carries well water
to an indoor standpipe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't hold much hope to buy a car, but we do hope to have
more household appliances. And more money in the bank,'' Huang
said.
</P>
<P>
   Zhan has done better for two reasons: he has six mu of land in
rice and orchards, double Huang's holdings, and off-season he does
lucrative construction work. His family's income averages 2,500 to
4,200 yuan a month. At the upper end, that equal $508 or nearly
$6,100 annually.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't easy money. Zhan and his wife do all the farm work now
that their two grown sons no longer live at home, but the farmer
said he still has plenty of energy to do construction engineering
in the city between crop demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are sure that if the world will stay peaceful,'' Zhan said,
``the life of peasants will become better and better.''

<P>
   SHAOSHAN, China _ The adobe house where Mao Tse-tung grew up is
a shrine not just to the father of communist China, but to the
spirit of the peasants who inspired and helped him fight a
revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Tan Ruiren's parents were among them, early members of the
Shaoshan peasants' movement that Mao was said to have started in a
small loft of that house in 1925 to help burdened, dirt-poor
peasants shape a new life.
</P>
<P>
   She still proudly shows the photograph of herself and fellow
workers meeting with Chairman Mao when he returned to visit in
1959, after the revolution had put the communists in power.
</P>
<P>
   Then, she was a young mother and the cook of the collective farm
where Mao ate.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Tan runs her own hectic restaurant across the pond from
Mao's house, where she also sells Mao trinkets and gladly
distributes every day hundreds of copies of that 1959 photo that
has brought her celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   Is she rich? Hard to say. But she's done awfully well since
China began loosening strictures of the command economy that Mao
clamped over the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Peasants in these idyllic mountain foothills of Hunan Province
are living all right these days, said Zhong Yang, a guide at the
museum and homestead of Mao.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest topic of conversation now is the internet,'' said
Zhong.
</P>
<P>
   Since the late leader Deng Xiaoping started dismantling Mao's
communist economy with reforms leading to division of the land
among farmers, as well as to private commerce and business, these
peasants have snapped up the chance to become entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   Cafes and souvenir shops have proliferated in this town that
still attracts 1.3 million tourists a year. Home construction is
booming.
</P>
<P>
   Today's peasants don't look or act much like revolutionaries.
</P>
<P>
   Tan, for example, started selling rice porridge to tourists when
reform filtered to this backwater, then just grew her business.
</P>
<P>
   A silver-haired woman of 70, Tan has fielded so many questions
over these years that she also has become silver-tongued.
</P>
<P>
   With all these changes in China, she was asked one recent
afternoon, how does she see the legacy of Chairman Mao?
</P>
<P>
   ``If people didn't have deep feelings about Chairman Mao they
wouldn't come here,'' she responded. ``If there was no Mao, there
would be no party and no Chinese people. If there was no Mao
Tse-tung thought, there is no Deng Xiaoping theory. Now we combine
the theory and the practice.''

ADVOCACY GROUPS FINDING THE INTERNET A POWERFUL RESOURCE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By KEN FOSKETT  
c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the tax-exempt group Putting Children First
was founded last year to promote school vouchers in Texas, it faced
a problem common to all such start-ups: How to attract contributors
and members who could mount an effective lobbying campaign?
</P>
<P>
   The answer came from a new but not unpredictable source: the
Internet. Mining the membership of Juno Online Services, the
nation's second largest carrier of personal e-mail accounts, the
Texas organization recently targeted its promotional advertising to
thousands of Texas e-mail users, many of whom e-mailed back,
wanting to be put on the group's mailing list.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great,'' said Greg Talley, the group's executive
director. ``It's cheaper than a postage stamp.''
</P>
<P>
   Voters have long been accustomed to the glossy political
pamphlets that arrive in the mail before elections and the barrage
of television advertising on the evening news. But tax-exempt
groups such as Putting Children First are now experimenting with
the power of the Internet to distribute political issue
advertising, recruit supporters and wage on-line lobbying campaigns
in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Another special interest group, which Juno declined to identify,
is paying Juno to send Juno's members an issue ad on legislation
currently before Congress. Voters who receive this ad will have the
option of e-mailing their member of Congress a pre-written letter
on the subject with a click of a mouse button.
</P>
<P>
   Juno also is talking to political candidates who could use the
company's database of 5 million members to send campaign literature
about themselves _ and their opponents _ to voters before the fall
elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potential for on-line advocacy is really fantastic,'' said
Oron Strauss of Net.Capitol, Inc., a private company that designs
Web pages for advocacy groups. ``The speed with which you can react
and mobilize large numbers of constituents or members is really
powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   All members of Congress now have e-mail addresses to communicate
electronically with constituents. Many candidates for political
office set up Web pages that prompt visitors to give them their
name and address to receive more information.
</P>
<P>
   Web sites for advocacy groups such as Americans for Tax Reform,
a conservative anti-tax group in Washington, have features that
allow visitors to read about an issue and then e-mail their member
of Congress about it.
</P>
<P>
   Friends of the Earth, an environmental group, recently launched
a Web site describing the costly environmental effects of driving
sports utility vehicles (SUVs). When Web surfers search for SUVs on
one of the Web search programs, they find the Friends of the Earth
site along with sites promoting SUVs.
</P>
<P>
   But the Juno Advocacy Network, a division of a New York company,
is taking issue advocacy a step farther, allowing advocacy groups
to target users unsolicited.
</P>
<P>
   In return for free e-mail, Juno members must complete a detailed
survey about their interests, financial position and family life
and agree to receive advertisements every time they log on to check
their mail.
</P>
<P>
   The company keeps its subscriber list confidential, but special
interest groups can come to Juno with a specific description of the
kind of people they would like to reach with their advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Putting Children First, for example, figured its ideal member
would be a mother between the ages of 25 and 45 who is also
religious. Juno quickly identified about 30,000 of the 361,000
members it has in Texas that fit the profile.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning two weeks ago, those Juno users checking their e-mail
were greeted by a colorful screen ad from Putting Children First.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Ardai, president of Juno, predicts that public interest
groups will soon value the speed of the internet and Juno's ability
to target voters based on their interests, background and street
address at little cost. On-line issue ads cost less than direct
mail, taking into account printing and production costs and
postage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before a vote, we can get the word out from the people who
have an opinion to the people who are merely forming an opinion _
the constituents _ and then encourage (them) to send their opinion
... to their representatives,'' said Ardai. ``This would by postal
mail take weeks, if not months. But on line, a company could come
to us today and we could have a message up to our users ...
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons people don't write their Congress people
more often is because they don't know who they are. ... But here
you don't even have to know who your Congress people are ... We
know what ZIP code you are in. We know what district you live in,
and we can have a button on the screen that says click here and
your message will go to your representative.''
</P>
<P>
   Political advertising on the Internet is still so new that most
experts and observers are unwilling to predict how quickly it will
catch on, or just what it signifies for American democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Reed, who ran the Web page for the Clinton-Gore 1996
election campaign and advises candidates on how to use the Internet
for campaigning, says Juno's membership base is still too small to
make it cost-effective for candidates to send out campaign
literature to voters in their district.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the audience gets large enough, I think you will see
every campaign tactic (on the Internet) that you currently see in
other mediums,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the potential for more ``sophisticated'' communication
between voters and politicians, Ardai noted that politicians could
e-mail a 12,000-word issue paper to voters for a fraction the cost
of mailing it. But he conceded that political dialogue in the
United States has been a ``steady drive in the other direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress report that more and more of their
constituents use e-mail, and that they treat e-mail like ordinary
mail. But members of Congress also distinguish between constituent
letters and mass mailings prompted by a special interest lobbying
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personal messages are the most powerful,'' said Sen. Paul
Coverdell, R-Ga.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, Juno also has the monopoly on on-line issue ads,
since other e-mail providers do not offer their services in
exchange for demographic information from subscribers that can be
sold to advertisers. Unless special interest groups have electronic
mailing lists of their own, they have to pay Juno for the
permission to use theirs.
</P>
<P>
   And Juno won't take just anything. Ardai and David Shaw,
chairman of D.E. Shaw &AMP; Co., which owns Juno, decided the company
won't run issue advertising from tobacco companies as ``a matter of
principle,'' said Ardai. Other types of advertising will be decided
on a case-by-case basis, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to be the arbiters of taste, certainly not
opinion, but we presume we will draw some lines,'' Ardai says.
``Something that would offend a member who merely holds a different
opinion, that's fair game. But something that would offend every
reasonable human being who saw it, that's not fair game.''

<P>
   KRASNOYARSK, Russia _ In the world of lonely hearts, Tatyana
Denoshova's lament rings loud and often.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to meet a real man here. Good men are already
married and if they are not already married, they are no good,''
said the dark-eyed Denoshova, 25, on her inability to find a
suitable mate.
</P>
<P>
   But in her case, the desperation resonates with urgency.
</P>
<P>
   A hospital nurse in this depressed Siberia city 2,000 miles east
of Moscow, Denoshova earns only $40 a month and hasn't been paid
since March. She says the men she meets are similarly strapped, or
sodden with vodka, or both.
</P>
<P>
   She and thousands of other Russian women have turned to catalog,
video and Internet-based matchmaking services seeking husbands _
preferably American or European men who will love them and take
them far away from the dead-end of today's Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's economic turmoil following the collapse of the Soviet
Union in 1991 and the ever-expanding World Wide Web have conspired
to make matchmaking a multimillion-dollar industry. Scores of
services also offer similar introductions to women from Asia and
Latin America as potential brides to men in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of my clients would prefer an American husband. Times in
our country are very bad and everyone wants a better life,'' said
Nina Kuzmena, a marriage broker in Krasnoyarsk who charges her
clients $20 each to shoot a video in her small living room.
</P>
<P>
   In cosmopolitan Moscow, the same rationale prevails.
</P>
<P>
   Elena Vishnitsev, 31, an accomplished artist, has been searching
for three years through an Internet-based service, Vetsa-Fortune,
which catalogs hundreds of young women searching for husbands.
</P>
<P>
   The agency charges $40 per female client for an unlimited
listing in their published catalog and on the Internet. Men are
charged $50 for each introduction they request after scrutinizing
the catalog.
</P>
<P>
   Vishnitsev's quest hasn't been easy. She divorced her Russian
husband in 1993 when his drinking became chronic. Trying to meet
men in bars or other public places is potentially dangerous and
demeaning, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the introductions via the service, while safer, also can be
degrading.
</P>
<P>
   Often, American and Russian services team up to hold Moscow
``socials'' where hordes of women gather at a Moscow disco to meet
a handful of American men who have paid thousands of dollars each
for a tour package to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The competition among women in my age group is very
difficult,'' she said. ``These meetings are terribly unpleasant.
You feel like you are for sale at a slave market.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she says, the agency ``gives hope to lonely women'' and
has brought her a number of near misses, though she's still looking
for Mr. Right.
</P>
<P>
   An Internet search via Yahoo.com produced 65 separate companies
offering to match American men and Russian women, listing thousands
of personal ads and color photos of women. Some offer a search
function, allowing men to specify age-range, hair color and height
_ and even body measurements _ among the galaxy of women being
advertised.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of the listings from Russia is Olga, a 23-year-old
English teacher from the northern city of Severodvinsk: ``I seek an
American or Canadian who is well-educated, thoughtful, and
passionate. I want to find someone special from another part of the
world who might value the importance of family values.''
</P>
<P>
   The marriage agencies stress that Russian women are eager
homemakers, yet also well-educated and poised. The sales pitch
plays on a sad Russian reality of soaring alcoholism and
unemployment rates among men, often leaving women as the sole
providers and caregivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They possess a strength of spirit combined with a delicate
femininity that sets them apart from the so-called `liberated'
women in the West,'' says the Web ad for the Svetlana Agency of St.
Petersburg, Russia's second largest city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be surprised to know that these highly educated and
charming women have housekeeping and cooking as their favorite
hobbies,'' says another company, European Introductions.
</P>
<P>
   Another is more blunt: ``Russian ladies are not destroyed by
feminism,'' a headline blares in one ad.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of this generally unregulated international industry
prompted the U.S. Congress to pass a 1996 law that requires
matchmaking companies to give information about marriage fraud,
legal residency and domestic violence to women they recruit or risk
fines up to $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, which estimated that 2,000 to 3,500 American
men find wives through such agencies every year, was prompted in
part by news accounts of cases of immigration fraud and sexual
offenses associated with such matches.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a small number of fraudulent, abusive, or
sex-oriented marriages that occur. These are, of course, good
stories, and as such are the only stories that end up in the papers
usually,'' said Beau Brummel, an American software developer who
found his wife Tania through a matchmaking service in St.
Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   Brummel, 31, who was living in rural North Carolina, said he
chose to search Russia for a wife because ``it was easier to review
the Russian women interested in Western men from my computer, and
correspond with them, than it was to be out all night dealing with
drunks and such, here in the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the women he met tended to be ``barely high-school
educated, usually overweight, and had no interest in or idea about
any of the things that were part of my professional life or
personal hobbies.''
</P>
<P>
   In February 1996, he ordered the addresses of 10 Russian women
and sent them letters. Only three wrote back, one of them his
wife-to-be. They corresponded for about four months until he
traveled to Russia and spent a few weeks with her and her family.
</P>
<P>
   They were married last August and now live in Portland, Oregon,
with her eight-year-old daughter from a previous marriage, his
six-year-old son and their baby Jessica, born in April.
</P>
<P>
   However, such success stories are few given the large numbers of
Russian women looking for mates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dealing with very lonely people in this business who
have unrealistic expectations. American men come here and want a
Barbie doll, a slim blonde without children and a woman much, much
younger than they are. Some younger Russian women want the jackpot,
too. A man who's going to sweep them away to the mansion in
America,'' said Nina Rubasheva, a co-owner of the Vesta-Fortune
agency in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   But in faraway Krasnoyarsk, a music teacher and divorced mother
of one, Ludmilla Karielina, 37, is realistic. She has braced
herself for a life alone, despite the hopes she has placed in a
matchmaking service.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better to be alone,'' she said, ``than to be with a man
who is bad.''

INTERNETTERS PUT A TWIST IN WEDDING TRADITIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (Charles Stough is an editor at the Dayton (Ohio) Daily News)  
 By CHARLES STOUGH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In June, many young couples turn their attentions to weddings _
the invitations, the decorations, the band, the food, the
bridesmaids, the bar, the federal agents, the cake....
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents? Well, not genuine ones.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents are part of one creative couple's plan. They have
designed a wedding on an X Files theme, after the hit TV series and
coming movie about strange space aliens and even stranger law
enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cerulean blue bridesmaids' dresses, the groom's men in
trenchcoats, masking tape X's on the chapel windows,'' a dreamer
posted in the Usenet newsgroup alt.wedding. It's an Internet site
where people post questions and advice about weddings.
</P>
<P>
   Not marriages. Weddings. They trade chat about marriages over in
soc.couples.
</P>
<P>
   ``Implants in the back of the neck of every member of the
wedding party,'' another contributor chimed in, picking up the
thread.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bridesmaids carry badges instead of bouquets and walk down the
aisle chanting `FBI.' Put the bridesmaids in scrubs and a white lab
coat, hair in a ponytail, tortoiseshell glasses. No bed in the
honeymoon suite, just a couch. The bride's dance with Dad is
`Beyond the Sea.' As favors, give little metal cylinders that have
nasty pointy things spring out when a button is pushed. And of
course the bride walks down the aisle to the haunting, whistled X
Files theme!''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe invitations that look like a subpoena?
</P>
<P>
   Where this wedding is to take place isn't clear. Contributors to
Usenet groups can be anywhere in the world. Probably not a major
place of worship of any mainstream sect. Well, maybe California.
</P>
<P>
   Other typical wedding-interest postings:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I'm looking for some amusement park or county fair type
touches for our reception. We were thinking about cotton candy and
caramel apples for snacks or favors. Any ideas what to put on the
tables?'' Sure, someone replied. Shop hobby shops for model
railroad stuff, like Ferris wheels.
</P>
<P>
   And have a small rubber duck at each place setting, another
contributor suggested, and the one with a star on the bottom takes
the centerpiece home.
</P>
<P>
   _ Is it a good idea in these modern times for the bride and
groom to live together for a while before the wedding? The question
gets asked two or three times a year in alt.wedding, and always
starts a weeks-long argument.
</P>
<P>
   But a recent posting from a bride offered new insight. Yes, she
said, and no only that, they should buy a house first. ``Now, that
was a stress inducing event that tops planning any wedding!'' she
said. ``Not only do you have to test how compatible you are, but
you have to test making compromises for the good of the
relationship, and stick to a rigorous savings plan as a couple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another good test is having to move together. We've moved
together three times. Trying to reach an equitable compromise on
getting rid of whose stuff can start some interesting conversations
as a couple.''
</P>
<P>
   _ How about a gift to give (ital) to (unital) one's parents at
the wedding? One idea is to create a videotape from favorite family
photos. Many photo shops can do it, even adding a touching sound
track.
</P>
<P>
   Alt.wedding postings explore the ways caterers operate, what to
demand from a band or disk jockey, the best man's speech, how to
handle split-family situations, what to do about heavy drinkers _
all the mundane stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Where it becomes most fun is in brainstorming. An X Files
wedding? Some couples would find that a difficult memory to carry
all their lives. But hashing out a wedding theme can cement a
relationship even better than moving a piano into the couple's
third apartment, and with a computer it's much more fun.

part by news accounts of cases of immigration fraud and sexual
offenses associated with such matches.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a small number of fraudulent, abusive, or
sex-oriented marriages that occur. These are, of course, good
stories, and as such are the only stories that end up in the papers
usually,'' said Beau Brummel, an American software developer who
found his wife Tania through a matchmaking service in St.
Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   Brummel, 31, who was living in rural North Carolina, said he
chose to search Russia for a wife because ``it was easier to review
the Russian women interested in Western men from my computer, and
correspond with them, than it was to be out all night dealing with
drunks and such, here in the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the women he met tended to be ``barely high-school
educated, usually overweight, and had no interest in or idea about
any of the things that were part of my professional life or
personal hobbies.''
</P>
<P>
   In February 1996, he ordered the addresses of 10 Russian women
and sent them letters. Only three wrote back, one of them his
wife-to-be. They corresponded for about four months until he
traveled to Russia and spent a few weeks with her and her family.
</P>
<P>
   They were married last August and now live in Portland, Oregon,
with her eight-year-old daughter from a previous marriage, his
six-year-old son and their baby Jessica, born in April.
</P>
<P>
   However, such success stories are few given the large numbers of
Russian women looking for mates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dealing with very lonely people in this business who
have unrealistic expectations. American men come here and want a
Barbie doll, a slim blonde without children and a woman much, much
younger than they are. Some younger Russian women want the jackpot,
too. A man who's going to sweep them away to the mansion in
America,'' said Nina Rubasheva, a co-owner of the Vesta-Fortune
agency in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   But in faraway Krasnoyarsk, a music teacher and divorced mother
of one, Ludmilla Karielina, 37, is realistic. She has braced
herself for a life alone, despite the hopes she has placed in a
matchmaking service.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better to be alone,'' she said, ``than to be with a man
who is bad.''

<P>
   The gaping wounds and ``die-back'' of skin caused by poisonous
snakebites could be drastically reduced with the help of a
miniature vacuum cleaner, says an Australian plastic surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   The small suction device draws off the fluid _ which often
contains toxins and bacteria _ generated by an inflammatory trauma
response within the wound. It is this fluid which blocks key blood
vessels and leads to necrosis _ the death of surrounding tissue.
Until now, repairing necrotic skin would have meant expensive
plastic surgery and a long stay in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   But hopes have been raised in Australia after doctors
successfully treated a 42-year-old woman for a wound caused by a
tiger snake's bite.
</P>
<P>
   With a vacuum technique normally used for treating wounds caused
by accidents or gunshots, Ian Holten, a plastic surgeon from the
Geelong Hospital near Melbourne, extracted half a liter of fluid
from the victim's wound in 24 hours. As a result, blood was able to
flow normally again, promoting the growth of healthy tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Holten reported the tiger snake case in May at the Annual
Scientific Congress of the Royal Australian College of Surgeons in
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first time the newly developed vacuum-assisted closure
(VAC) device, has been used to reduce the often devastating
aftereffects of a snakebite.
</P>
<P>
   Invented by Louis Argenta, a plastic surgeon from the Bowman
Gray School of Medicine at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem,
N.C., the VAC wound system is being made by a Texas-based company,
Kinetic Concepts. Argenta says that by getting rid of fluid, the
VAC can make wounds heal four times faster than they would
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   The tiger snake victim had been bitten on the foot. Although her
life was saved by an antivenin injection, a hole 3 centimeters
square opened up around the bite, and her foot swelled and became
painful. Holten put a foam dressing in the hole then used a thin
plastic film to seal the area. Then, using the vacuum pump, which
was attached to a tube embedded in the foam, he sucked off the
fluid.
</P>
<P>
   Next, Holten wants to test the technique on a patient whose leg
has ulcerated from toe to knee after being bitten by Australia's
venomous white-tailed spider.
</P>
<P>
   But Ken Winkel from the Australian Venom Research Unit at the
University of Melbourne says it is far too early to know if the
technique will become a commonplace way to deal with the effects of
bites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trials are needed,'' he said. ``You can't say too much based
on one or two isolated cases.''

   ``N Is for Noose.'' By Sue Grafton. Henry Holt and Co. $25. 289
pages.
</P>
<P>
   Picking up a new Kinsey Millhone alphabet mystery is like
sitting down to eat comfort food _ almost always satisfying, unless
a key ingredient is missing. And ``N'' is missing Santa Teresa,
Kinsey's hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Kinsey drives to Nota Lake, Calif., to meet with Selma Newquist,
whose police officer husband had recently died of a heart attack.
Selma has accepted the coroner's report. After all, Tom Newquist
was in his mid-60s, worked too hard, smoked too much and loved junk
food. But Tom was moody and withdrawn the last six weeks of his
life and Selma wants to know why.
</P>
<P>
   Accepting the case, Kinsey figures she'll only have to spend a
couple of days in Nota Lake. As she starts asking questions, Tom's
fellow officers and friends all say the same thing _ Tom was a
great guy and had no problems. And they all dislike Selma, so they
are not very helpful. Under such conditions, Kinsey would have
signed off the case. But then she is attacked and is determined to
find out why.
</P>
<P>
   ``N'' moves at a slow pace, putting most of the real action at
the end of the book. And Kinsey's usually good instincts fail her
in Nota Lake. ``N'' isn't the best Grafton, but it's not bad
either. I just hope ``O'' keeps Kinsey at home with her wonderful
cast of friends.

   ``Fortunes of War.'' By Stephen Coonts. St. Martin's Press.
$24.95.
</P>
<P>
   Coonts' latest military thriller delivers on all fronts _ in the
air, on land, and under the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Military fanatics gain entrance to the Imperial Palace in Tokyo
and behead the emperor as the new prime minister plots the takeover
of the Siberian oil fields. Japanese air force pilot Jiro Kimura
gets word to U.S. Col. Bob Cassidy, his best friend at the U.S. Air
Force Academy, that Japan will invade Siberia in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Cassidy's superiors order him back to Washington and tell him
that the United Stats has signed a secret protocol to aid Russia in
any military conflict. As the Japanese invasion begins, Cassidy is
asked to resign his commission and form a unit of at least 12
pilots to fly F-22s over Russia and shoot down Japanese planes.
Cassidy agrees, but fears that he will have to fight Kimura before
the war is over.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Russian Capt. Pavel Saratov uses his very old diesel
sub to fight two incredible missions against the Japanese. These
scenes are as vivid as any submarine battles that you've seen in
the movies.
</P>
<P>
   Coonts creates very human, yet extraordinary, characters and
puts them in perilous situations. The dialogue is real, the battle
scenes are terrific. ``Fortunes of War'' is a fast-paced and
believable thriller from one of the masters of the genre.

   ``Term Limits.'' By Vince Flynn. Pocket Books. $23. 403 pages.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, after the New York publishing world rejected his
political thriller, Flynn returned home to St. Paul, Minn., got
help from three local investors and published ``Term Limits.''
After it became a bestseller in Minneapolis-St. Paul, Pocket Books
picked up the very readable debut.
</P>
<P>
   The night before Congress is scheduled to vote on the
president's budget, three very powerful and very corrupt
congressmen are murdered. Special FBI Agent Skip McMahon is put in
charge of the investigation and immediately concludes that the
killers are highly trained professionals, probably former U.S.
commandos.
</P>
<P>
   The networks get a letter from the killers demanding that the
president withdraw his budget and draw up a ``balanced budget using
zero-based budgeting. This budget will contain no new or raised
taxes and will cut all unneeded federal programs. ... This is the
only warning we will give. If you do not respond to these demands,
you will be killed. None of you is out of reach _ not even the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Freshman Rep. Michael O'Rourke thinks the killers did the nation
a favor, but when his mentor, Sen. Erik Olson, is killed by a car
bomb, O'Rourke is determined to find the killers, fearing he may
know who they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``Term Limits'' really works _ good characters, an interesting
plot, decent dialogue and good understanding of Washington. A fine
debut.

   ``Balance of Power.'' James W. Huston. William Morrow and Co.
$25. 416 pages.
</P>
<P>
   Huston's geopolitical thriller debut is a winner.
</P>
<P>
   Armed pirates hijack the world's newest and fastest cargo ship _
the Pacific Flyer out of San Diego _ at the port of Jakarta and
force the captain to leave port. One of the crew manages to send a
SOS radio message before he is executed.
</P>
<P>
   The pirates kill all the crew but the captain, booby-trap the
ship and flee in three cigarette boats. A Navy Seal team parachutes
aboard the ship, finds the victims and the bombs and all but one
Seal manages to escape before the ship blows up.
</P>
<P>
   After the pirates demand that the United States remove its
military presence from the South Pacific and threaten to blow up
more ships, the president refuses to order a military assault
against them. Convinced the president is a pacifist, the Speaker of
the House asks both houses of Congress to vote on a Letter of
Marquis and Reprisal, a constitutional means enabling Congress to
direct the military to attack the pirates once the Seals discover
their whereabouts on a remote Indonesian island.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, a constitutional crisis breaks out in Washington and
the White House starts the legal process to have the Letter of
Reprisal declared unconstitutional. Meanwhile, the commander of the
U.S. fleet nearest Indonesia must decide whether to obey the
president or the Letter of Reprisal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Balance of Power'' ably balances the legal and military
battles. The plot is not very believable, but this thriller is
still a fun read, with interesting characters.

TEENS SPURN LUSTFUL TEMPTATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KELLY ETTENBOROUGH  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) - Faith Shepherd went to her prom with 29 of her
friends. Each one of the Mormon teens had a date, but none went as
a mushy, romantic, kissy-face (begin ital) couple. (endital).
</P>
<P>
   Lubna Ahmad, a 13-year-old Muslim, is more interested in music
and math than boys. She plans to stay focused on classes at Corona
del Sol High School in Tempe, and when she's ready to marry, she
will follow Muslim guidelines in choosing a husband, a match based
on common values, beliefs and goals, not on superficial attraction,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Josh Harris, 23, will kiss his fiancee for the first time on
Oct. 3 _ after they are pronounced husband and wife. Harris is a
Christian and national speaker on sexual purity before marriage.
</P>
<P>
   In a culture where magazine headlines preach ``Lust Lessons:
Teach Them Tonight'' and television shows depict prom-night sex as
the norm, these and other young adults are following their
religious convictions and putting off serious romantic
relationships until marriage is in the picture.
</P>
<P>
   Their beliefs are grounded in the scriptures of their faiths:
Protestant, Catholic, Muslim, Mormon, Jewish and Hindu. Sexual
purity before marriage is the standard. The teens set boundaries in
an effort to avert temptation and live up to the standard.
</P>
<P>
   These aren't stay-at-home wallflower types. Many don't limit
themselves to double dating or family activities, but they won't be
alone in a car at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   They appreciate good looks, but they are more impressed with
good character. They may not marry the first person they seriously
date, but they don't want to pursue romance and its entanglements
until they are mature enough to make a commitment.
</P>
<P>
   They're not prudes, Shepherd, 17, said and blushingly admitted
that she kissed a boy once.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someday I'll do it again,'' said the senior at Westwood High
School in Mesa. ``Now isn't the time to find my husband. It's a
time to find the qualities I want in a husband.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Phil Baniewicz, executive director of Life Teen Inc., which
involves about 50,000 Catholic teenagers in the United States, ``As
much as we see the teens being sexually involved, we're seeing the
other extreme, the positive extreme: Young people who are saying,
`I'm going to hold strong in my faith, and I'm not going to
compromise my values.'
</P>
<P>
   ``They tend to do group dating. You didn't see that a whole lot
five or 10 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Harris spoke to more than 14,000 teenagers and their
parents at his New Attitude conferences in Phoenix and other U.S.
cities. Since he was 17, he has talked to about 30,000 people about
modern-day courtship. He has also written a book, ``I Kissed Dating
Goodbye,'' in which he lays out guidelines for dating.
</P>
<P>
   His stages for developing a godly romantic relationship are
casual friendship, deeper friendship, purposeful intimacy with
integrity and engagement.
</P>
<P>
   Harris declared his intentions for marriage while he and his
fiancee were in the deeper-friendship phase. This, he said, created
less pressure than dating casually because the relationship was
more purposeful and better defined.
</P>
<P>
   The couple also are committed to wait for that first kiss, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would serve both of us, having a pure relationship and not
to be stoking the fires unnecessarily,'' Harris said. ``We are very
passionate about each other and very anxious to be able to
experience that aspect of our relationship, but it's neat working
to learn to communicate clearly. We can't fall back on the physical
side of our relationship to smooth things over.''
</P>
<P>
   The first printing of ``I Kissed Dating Goodbye'' totaled
170,000 copies, of which more than 120,000 have been sold. Harris,
a pastoral intern at Covenant Life Church in Gaithersburg, Md., has
found Christians and non-Christians who appreciate his message, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing how many teenagers out there are not into the
dating scene, and they feel something is completely wrong with
them,'' he said. ``It's like a weight is lifted off their
shoulders. There are others who are really into (dating), and the
book is kind of an annoyance.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg and Joneen Ross of Gilbert found the dating scene awkward
when they were young and wanted a better experience for their
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't do courtship,'' said Joneen, a homemaker. ``On
looking back on our dating experiences, there was nothing really
positive about that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We grew up in Christian households, and we were taught to
maintain moral purity, but there were no tools to work with,'' said
Greg, a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Ross, 18, thinks that courtship is a good idea, too. He
wants to treat girls as sisters in Christ and not pursue a serious
relationship until he's ready for marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It frees you up,'' Matthew said. ``It just comes back to
basically trusting God.''
</P>
<P>
   Meredith Mullan, a varsity cheerleader and secretary of the
student body at Dobson High School, finds that the best dates are
those who share her religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could go to church with them and you had this
understanding of belief, and you knew you weren't going to do
things that would compromise your faith,'' said Mullan, who attends
St. Timothy Catholic Community Center in Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   Rishi Popat wants to marry someone who shares his Hindu beliefs
and Indian traditions. At North High School in Phoenix, two girls
fit that description. At Trinity College in Connecticut, where he
will study to be a neurosurgeon in the fall, he hopes more girls
will be in that category.
</P>
<P>
   In his parents' era, he said, most Hindu marriages were
arranged. He doesn't expect an arranged marriage, but long-term
compatibility will be considered before any serious relationship
begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indian teens like myself date if there is the right chemistry
and not just superficial qualities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other teens see marriage as a distant future.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Farnsworth, 17, says group dating allows him to get to
know girls while doing away with date anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are with groups and with your friends, you're more up
to talking and having fun,'' said the Westwood High senior, who in
about two years will go on a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter-day Saints.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go against the standards, you're the oddball. No one
will even try anything because everyone will think they're silly.
We all push each other along and give each other the strength and
the support because we all want the same thing. It's not just the
church's decision or my parents' decision. It's my decision.'' &QL;

   (Undated) - Love came after marriage for Mubeen and Farah Khan,
young professionals who live in Mesa, Ariz., and followed
traditional Muslim practices in arranging their marriage.
</P>
<P>
   She had rejected two potential suitors before they exchanged
pictures and personal resumes at the suggestion of his mother's
friend. The pair found the information interesting, and the
families, who lived in different states, arranged to meet in
October 1994.
</P>
<P>
   That first meeting was awkward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was nervous, especially when you are meeting under these
circumstances,'' Mubeen Khan said. ``It isn't a meeting to say,
`Hey, do you want to go on a date?' It's meeting with the
intentions of `am I going to marry this person?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The families clicked, and Mubeen and Farah followed up with
phone conversations. They requested a second meeting of the
families at Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family was teasing her that I had left,'' Mubeen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came in with roses and a box of chocolates,'' Frah said.
``It was like a done deal, chocolate and flowers, please.''
</P>
<P>
   As they told the story of their courtship and marriage, they
laughed and finished each other's sentences.
</P>
<P>
   There were more phone calls and more family meetings. On April
15, 1995, they were engaged. They wooed each other with letters and
flowers but still did not spend time together alone. They didn't
even see each other for a few months before the Sept. 3, 1995,
wedding.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were feelings that existed between us before we got
married, but to call that love after months and after just getting
to know each other?'' Mubeen Khan said. ``After marriage, that's
when I think we really felt responsible toward each other. We felt
the commitment was there and our love for each other started
growing.''
</P>
<P>
   It takes faith in their religion, they said, to believe
everything will work out. And, their marriage is wonderful, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Love as far as physical attraction, everyone changes looks
over time,'' Mubeen Khan said. ``To seek out the person within is
the most important thing. That's something that Islam encourages.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, he's a 25-year-old marketing representative at
Caterpillar Financial and MBA student. She's a 26-year-old staffing
manager at Robert Half International. &QL;

NEW AUTHORS MAKE FOR EXCITING LISTENING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June 14)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DOUG BLACKBURN  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The shelves devoted to suspense at major
bookstores are getting crowded. Every day, it seems, a new author
emerges to compete with the dozens of standard-bearers.
</P>
<P>
   This is a mostly good development, because new voices often
bring fresh characters and perspectives. Not that every man and
woman writing a mystery-thriller is capable of fleshing out
interesting characters, as well as compelling plots. But as more
writers compete for our attention, talented new authors replace
some of the veterans who act like they are writing by rote.
</P>
<P>
   This assumes, of course, that there is more than an ounce of
justice in the publishing and book-buying worlds. If there is,
first-time authors Pamela Thomas-Graham and Margaret Cuthbert will
muscle out longtime best-seller writer Mary Higgins Clark, or at
least rate a seat at her table.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas-Graham and Cuthbert, both talented and successful
African-American professionals, have demonstrated with their debuts
that they know how to develop a compelling heroine, as well as the
suspense-filled plot the genre demands.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some new books available in audio:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _____ &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``A Darker Shade of Crimson,'' by Pamela Thomas-Graham; read by
Hazelle Goodman; abridged, approximately 3 hours; Simon &AMP; Schuster
Audio; $18.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas-Graham brings a fresh and welcome voice with her debut,
``A Darker Shade of Crimson.'' Not that Thomas-Graham needs a new
job; she's a poster child for thirtysomething success. At age 32
she became one of the most influential women in American business
when she was named the first black woman partner at McKinsey &AMP; Co.,
the world's largest management consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, she decided to try her hand at what is being billed
the Ivy League mystery series. Thomas-Graham's heroine, Veronica
``Nikki'' Chase, a Harvard economics professor, is a compelling
character who navigates her way through a complex interracial
world. She also is fearless, which helps her as she unravels the
mysterious death of the dean of students. Read flawlessly by
actress Hazelle Goodman, ``Crimson'' hopefully is but the first of
many books Thomas-Graham will share with us.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _____ &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Silent Cradle,'' by Margaret Cuthbert; read by Tonya
Pinkins; abridged, approximately 3 hours; Simon &AMP; Schuster Audio;
$18.
</P>
<P>
   It helps to know your terrain. Cuthbert, who debuts as a
medical-thriller author with ``The Silent Cradle,'' is the vice
chair of obstetrics and gynecology at a medical center in Berkeley,
Calif. As is her heroine, Dr. Rae Duprey, the premier obstetrician
at her hospital in fictional Berkeley Hills who has stumbled on a
series of ``bad baby'' cases coming out of a birth center
affiliated with her hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Cuthbert succeeds on several fronts. The medical complications
she describes seem real and believable, as do the cut-throat
politics within the hospital administration. She also has developed
a winning protagonist in Duprey, the lone black woman in her
department, a passionate and gutsy doctor totally devoted to saving
babies and their mothers. Cuthbert has hit a home run her first
time at bat.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _____ &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You Belong to Me,'' by Mary Higgins Clark; read by Jayne
Atkinson; abridged, about 3 hours; Simon &AMP; Schuster Audio; $18.
</P>
<P>
   Clark is a publisher's dream. She writes a thriller almost once
a year, and without fail there's a subsequent parting in the
bestseller lists. Every one of her 15 novels has rocketed its way
onto the charts. Unfortunately, Clark is not always a reader's
dream, except to die-hard fans.
</P>
<P>
   In her latest, ``You Belong to Me'' (which has been No. 1 on the
hardcover bestseller list), there is plenty of plot, but the
characters are so poorly developed that one-dimensional is a
generous description.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Chandler, a successful New York psychologist and host of a
popular radio talk show, closes in on uncovering a killer who
targets lonely women on cruise ships. People who might help solve
the crimes are stabbed to death, and Chandler is at risk as well.
It's difficult to care about anything other than the killer's
identity, because this is a boiler-plate thriller lacking
originality.

DAD HELPED PREPARE SON FOR MARRIAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<P>
   (Undated) -Randal and Erin Palmer met when he was 16 and she was
14. Both had left their hometowns to go on a church mission trip to
Atlanta, and neither was interested in dating or serious
relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Teens in the Christian group stayed in touch through letters.
Six months later, Randal and Erin were writing only each other.
From 1990 to 1993, they wrote frequently but never elevated the
relationship beyond friendship. In fact, their parents read their
letters.
</P>
<P>
   Randal's father was a confidant and helped prepare him for
marriage. After Randal turned 18, his father asked if he had met a
young woman he felt particularly drawn to. Erin was the only one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I noticed the character of her faith; how much she loved
God,'' said Randal, who lives in Arizona. ``It seemed unrealistic
at the time because she was still in Florida. Dating has so many
expectations and everything seems to be based on the outward. We
were real with one another in our letters.''
</P>
<P>
   His father arranged for her trip to Arizona in April 1993, and
they spent all their time with family. Before she returned home,
the family talked about where their hearts were.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pretty much expected that this was leading to a courtship. I
had been praying about it,'' Erin said. ``I really began noticing
that the feelings I thought were just friendship were really love,
that I loved him, that I admired and respected him.''
</P>
<P>
   Erin and her mother made the next trip to Arizona together in
September 1993. Two days after the couple's first date alone -
eating at McDonald's and seeing ``Jurassic Park'' - Randal dressed
as a knight in shining armor. With two dozen roses and a ring in
hand, he proposed in front of everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Four months before the wedding on April 30, 1994, Erin moved to
the Valley and lived with a church family. They spent most of their
time together with family, went to premarital counseling at the
church and were careful about how they spent time alone. The
honeymoon was great, they said with a grin.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are really no regrets in terms of whether we did it
right,'' said Randal, sitting close to Erin on their living room
couch, his arm around her. ``We saved ourselves for each other.
This is the way it's supposed to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The Palmers, who live in Gilbert, are youth leaders at Trinity
New Life Church in Tempe. She works as an administrative assistant
and he as a customer service manager, but they are preparing to
spend a year in Washington, D.C., where he will attend pastor's
college. &QL;

   CONTEMPORARY-CW-WOMEN (Undated) It's Madonna meets Patsy Cline.
With the success of performers like Shania Twain, country music has
watched its women evolve from folksy ol' gals like Loretta Lynn and
Kitty Wells to big city, sexy, pop-crossover dynamos like Twain,
Deana Carter and Mindy McCready, who sing tough and wear navel
rings and crop tops in MTV-style videos. Though their predecessors
blazed a path for them, these contemporary country-western women
are assertive in an in-your-face, sexually upfront '90s way. We
look at this new era of ``country diva.''

   BOEING-MCDONNELL (Long Beach, Calif.) The former McDonnell
Douglas plant in Long Beach, Calif., is rich in history but not
much else. The president of the union here says walking into the
Douglas facility is like walking into a Henry Ford auto factory. He
was shocked during a recent visit to the Everett, Wash., plant to
see the difference in tooling. Without a 737 assembly line the Long
Beach plant has no future. McDonnell was supposed to save Douglas,
but after the buyout McDonnell invested in defense and not the
Douglas commercial operations. That's why Douglas workers are
working so hard to make a good impression on Boeing executives.

PBS RADIO HOST BATTLING VOCAL DISORDER. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA YOST  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) - To a woman whose voice is her livelihood, losing the
power of speech was a frightening prospect for Diane Rehm, host of
National Public Radio's ``The Diane Rehm Show.''
</P>
<P>
   But that prospect became a reality when her voice began to
deteriorate several years ago, leaving her wondering whether she
would have to abandon the 20-year broadcasting career she loved.
</P>
<P>
   Rehm has been off the air since Feb. 23, seeking treatment for a
condition diagnosed as spasmodic dysphonia. She has received
injections of botulinum toxin, or botox _ medicine that temporarily
paralyzes the vocal cords. Her voice is returning, and Rehm expects
to be back on the air Thursday (June 11).
</P>
<P>
   Her program originates from American University in Washington,
D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Rehm was interviewed during her recuperation. To avoid straining
her voice, the interview was conducted '90s style _ via e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Sounding upbeat about her recovery, she wrote, ``I do believe
there are no accidents and that I have spasmodic dysphonia for a
reason. I believe that reason may be to help educate others about a
problem that really makes people feel such shame and embarrassment
that they choose not to talk at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``What better person to put the word out than a radio talk-show
host?''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; QUESTION: Describe your ailment and how symptoms first
appeared.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANSWER: About four or five years ago, I began to hear a slight
tremor in my voice. It occurred only occasionally, so I didn't pay
too much attention.
</P>
<P>
   Then, for the first time, an engineer heard it and asked whether
I was nervous. I said of course not, redid the track, and went on.
But I knew something had happened.
</P>
<P>
   I sought out several otolaryngologists, who checked me out and
referred me to neurologists as well. But none saw anything serious
amiss. They initially attributed my vocal tremor to nerves and
prescribed a commonly used drug to calm me down.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the tremor began to be much more noticeable, and
along with it came a difficulty with speaking and articulating
clearly. I encountered moments on the air when I wasn't quite sure
whether the words would come out. It was an enormous frustration to
me, and I'm sure to listeners.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after four or five years of speech therapy, which
brought only modest improvement, my internist insisted I go to
Johns Hopkins University (in Baltimore) for a complete diagnosis.
That's when I first encountered neurologist Stephen Reich and
otolaryngologist Paul Flint, both of whom diagnosed me as suffering
from spasmodic dysphonia.
</P>
<P>
   It's a neurological problem which begins in the basal ganglia,
the portion of the brain which controls muscle movement. The brain
is sending an incorrect message to the muscles of the vocal cords,
telling them to shut down too tightly on the cords themselves _
hence the struggle to get words out or to articulate particular
sounds.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: Is this a rare condition?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: I have seen figures ranging from 50,000 to 500,000 sufferers
in the U.S., but because so few doctors are aware of and can
recognize the symptoms of SD, only about 10,000 have been fully
diagnosed and are undergoing treatment.
</P>
<P>
   People are embarrassed because their voices sound so bad.
Sentences are cracked, the tone of voice fluctuates, and they don't
want to be heard. People who suffer think it's their problem alone
and never look for help.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: How did you deal with the onset of symptoms?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: I was not only frightened, I became increasingly depressed,
feeling as though I would have to leave the career I had come to
love and enjoy so much. But at the same time, I had done a
considerable amount of reading about voice problems, and had come
across mention of spasmodic dysphonia and botox in several medical
books.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: Before being diagnosed, did you have any hint of what could
be causing the problem?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: When the speech therapy did not seem to do the job, I began
to suspect that it was more complicated than just learning to
breathe correctly. . . . I also began to wonder whether the problem
was stress-related because I had an awful lot going on.
</P>
<P>
   What did seem strange, however, was that, unusual as my voice is
for one on radio, I've always been able to rely on it, even during
other very stressful periods in my life. This was clearly
different.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, there's no known specific cause, there is no cure,
and there is no known reason as to why or how it begins. But there
is research going on all over the country, so someday there may be
more answers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: When did you begin treatments?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: I had my first injection of botox on May 5. As you might
know, botulinum toxin in high doses is absolutely deadly. But the
injections given are about 1,000 times smaller than what they would
need to be to become lethal.
</P>
<P>
   I was injected with .5 units on either side of the throat,
directly into the muscles controlling the vocal cords. Dr. Flint
attached tiny discs to my throat area, so that he could actually
see on a television screen exactly where the needle was going in.
It was uncomfortable, but not intolerable.
</P>
<P>
   The entire experience lasted less than five minutes. When my
husband and I left Johns Hopkins, we took a long, long walk around
the (Baltimore) inner harbor. I felt fine, my voice was still
working.
</P>
<P>
   We had a lovely dinner at the hotel that night, and I slept
well. The next morning, I still had a voice, which continued
through the next day and evening. Then, at 3:30 a.m. the next
morning, I woke up with only the barest whisper, indicating that
the botox had worked.
</P>
<P>
   I woke my husband, and we did a high five!
</P>
<P>
   Today, four weeks after that first botox injection, I have
considerable voice. I spoke with Dr. Flint (last Wednesday), and he
tells me that the incremental improvement . . . will be
considerable.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: What kind of response have you had from listeners?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: The response has just been overwhelming. I spend much of my
days answering e-mail from folks who are wishing me well, wondering
when I'll return and offering prayers for me. I can tell you there
have been hundreds of those messages, in addition to letters and
cards from so many good people. I am so grateful because I know
those prayers and good wishes have made a difference.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: Have you been able to keep up your spirits?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: When I first left the air on Feb. 23, I was pretty down. I
had done my two-hour show that morning, and then had a car waiting
to take me to a downtown hotel, where I moderated a discussion
before about 300 people. I barely made it. My voice had simply
given out. I rushed back to the station, went straight to my
manager, Kim Hodgson, and told him I'd have to take some time off.
. . . I simply could not control my voice any longer.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, I was not optimistic. I thought I would have
to end my radio career much sooner than I had expected to. The
voice therapy was not working, no matter how much I practiced or
how much I tried. I saw a behavioral therapist and a
psychopharmacolgist, who helped me deal with my anxiety and
depression.
</P>
<P>
   Then, finally, my internist, Carole Horn, stepped in and said,
``Enough! I want you to go to Johns Hopkins and see these two
doctors.'' At first, I was annoyed, feeling as though this was just
one more futile effort. But, thank heavens, I've finally gotten a
diagnosis, the correct treatment, and feel as though I'm on a quick
path to recovery.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: How did you recruit so many great people to fill in for you?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: Steve Roberts (syndicated columnist with his wife,
journalist Cokie Roberts, and journalism teacher at George
Washington University) and Susan Page (White House correspondent
for ``USA Today'') have filled in for me over the last several
years whenever I've been on vacation, out sick or off making a
speech.
</P>
<P>
   Now with Jim Angle (White House correspondent for Fox News) and
Tom Gjelton (international correspondent for NPR), we feel so
fortunate to have such a marvelous lineup of people willing to
stand in. It is extremely gratifying to know that these very busy
people are willing to do this for me.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: What occupies your time during your time off the air?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: I spend much time at the computer answering e-mail
(drehm(at)wamu.org). I am also online or on the phone with the
producers of the show many times a day. We talk about various
options for shows, guests and books. Now that I have a voice, I'm
on the phone with them more frequently. I have also written a diary
for ``Slate'' magazine that has now been posted at my Web site
(www.wamu.org), and, as you might imagine, I am continuing to work
on my book.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, during the first couple of months after I took
off, I was not writing very much at all. I just didn't have the
heart for it. But now that things are looking up, I'm right back to
it. I want to finish it by November so that it will come out in
time for my 20th anniversary as host of ``The Diane Rehm Show.''
It's being published by Knopf, and its title is ``Finding My
Voice.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: How much have you missed being on the air?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: I've missed it enormously. We've had some great guests, and
I've been so sad at not being there. At the same time, it's been
fun hearing how each of the guest hosts handled various situations.
It's always good to sit back and listen and learn from pros! My
voice will not be perfect, but judging from listener response, I
trust they'll bear with me. &QL;

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: THE MILLENNIAL MELTDOWN
 &HT;    For release Sunday, June 14
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton, never one to duck an easy
compromise, has declared that 2000 will be known as the
``millennial year.''
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, Clinton has neatly sidestepped the issue of whether
the party to mark the start of the new millennium should be held on
Dec. 31, 1999, or whether we should hold off for another year to
celebrate. The presidential decree leaves us free to pop our
millennial corks either at the start or at the finish _ or twice.
</P>
<P>
   Since the era that marks the birth of Jesus Christ began with
the year 1, rather than with a year 0, scholars insist that the
current millennium won't properly end until midnight on Dec. 31,
2000. Similarly, they hold that 20th century did not began until
Jan. 1, 1901.
</P>
<P>
   But such academic nits carry no weight in the media and
entertainment worlds. They are primed to blast us into the new
millennium as soon as 2000 rolls around _ if not sooner. Thus the
next 18 months or so will bring a heavy dose of pre-millennial
spectaculars, interspersed with nostalgic reflections on what we're
about to leave behind.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to the millennium bug, the techies can fairly
stand their ground, since that cyberpest is due to strike a year
before, strictly speaking, the century is due to turn. Until that
happens, there are at least three lessons to be drawn from a
digital Armaggedon that is already receiving a big media sendoff.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson No. 1: Folks fail to plan ahead. If the year 2000 bug
will cause the lights to go out, the planes to be grounded and the
tax refunds to go haywire, to cite but a few of the anticipated
woes, then managers should have insisted at the dawn of the
computer age, whatever the cost, that a full four digits be used in
entering years in software dates.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, they didn't, which leads us to Lesson No. 2: For every
downside, there's an upside.
</P>
<P>
   The downside: Fixing the hidden glitches that gave rise to the
Year 2000 problem will be a time-consuming and labor-intensive job
that will cost the corporate world and the nation's taxpayers, at a
minimum, hundreds of billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The upside: None of those billions will actually go up in smoke.
Rather, they will wind up fattening some other people's bank
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Like those of Microsoft Corp., which currently blankets the
trade press with ads that tout its fully Year-2000 compliant
network servers, which can be swapped out in corporate makeovers.
Like the old programmers who are being brought out of retirement
and, perhaps less honorably, like the lawyers who are busy drafting
class-action suits charging negligence. There's even a new biweekly
magazine out there, with its own Web site, that is devoted solely
to what acronym-prone techies have dubbed ``Y2K'' issues.
</P>
<P>
   The final lesson is that there is more to life than databases.
After all, well before computers were invented, city lights shone,
planes flew, companies wrote orders and newspaper columns got
written. (Anybody still have a typewriter?)
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there's no going back. But if some things don't run
quite right on Jan. 1, 2000, then at least we'll be free to go out
for a fine winter walk.

PBS RADIO HOST BATTLING VOCAL DISORDER. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA YOST  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) - To a woman whose voice is her livelihood, losing the
power of speech was a frightening prospect for Diane Rehm, host of
National Public Radio's ``The Diane Rehm Show.''
</P>
<P>
   But that prospect became a reality when her voice began to
deteriorate several years ago, leaving her wondering whether she
would have to abandon the 20-year broadcasting career she loved.
</P>
<P>
   Rehm has been off the air since Feb. 23, seeking treatment for a
condition diagnosed as spasmodic dysphonia. She has received
injections of botulinum toxin, or botox _ medicine that temporarily
paralyzes the vocal cords. Her voice is returning, and Rehm expects
to be back on the air Thursday (June 11).
</P>
<P>
   Her program originates from American University in Washington,
D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Rehm was interviewed during her recuperation. To avoid straining
her voice, the interview was conducted '90s style _ via e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Sounding upbeat about her recovery, she wrote, ``I do believe
there are no accidents and that I have spasmodic dysphonia for a
reason. I believe that reason may be to help educate others about a
problem that really makes people feel such shame and embarrassment
that they choose not to talk at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``What better person to put the word out than a radio talk-show
host?''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; QUESTION: Describe your ailment and how symptoms first
appeared.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANSWER: About four or five years ago, I began to hear a slight
tremor in my voice. It occurred only occasionally, so I didn't pay
too much attention.
</P>
<P>
   Then, for the first time, an engineer heard it and asked whether
I was nervous. I said of course not, redid the track, and went on.
But I knew something had happened.
</P>
<P>
   I sought out several otolaryngologists, who checked me out and
referred me to neurologists as well. But none saw anything serious
amiss. They initially attributed my vocal tremor to nerves and
prescribed a commonly used drug to calm me down.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the tremor began to be much more noticeable, and
along with it came a difficulty with speaking and articulating
clearly. I encountered moments on the air when I wasn't quite sure
whether the words would come out. It was an enormous frustration to
me, and I'm sure to listeners.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after four or five years of speech therapy, which
brought only modest improvement, my internist insisted I go to
Johns Hopkins University (in Baltimore) for a complete diagnosis.
That's when I first encountered neurologist Stephen Reich and
otolaryngologist Paul Flint, both of whom diagnosed me as suffering
from spasmodic dysphonia.
</P>
<P>
   It's a neurological problem which begins in the basal ganglia,
the portion of the brain which controls muscle movement. The brain
is sending an incorrect message to the muscles of the vocal cords,
telling them to shut down too tightly on the cords themselves _
hence the struggle to get words out or to articulate particular
sounds.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: Is this a rare condition?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: I have seen figures ranging from 50,000 to 500,000 sufferers
in the U.S., but because so few doctors are aware of and can
recognize the symptoms of SD, only about 10,000 have been fully
diagnosed and are undergoing treatment.
</P>
<P>
   People are embarrassed because their voices sound so bad.
Sentences are cracked, the tone of voice fluctuates, and they don't
want to be heard. People who suffer think it's their problem alone
and never look for help.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: How did you deal with the onset of symptoms?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: I was not only frightened, I became increasingly depressed,
feeling as though I would have to leave the career I had come to
love and enjoy so much. But at the same time, I had done a
considerable amount of reading about voice problems, and had come
across mention of spasmodic dysphonia and botox in several medical
books.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: Before being diagnosed, did you have any hint of what could
be causing the problem?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: When the speech therapy did not seem to do the job, I began
to suspect that it was more complicated than just learning to
breathe correctly. . . . I also began to wonder whether the problem
was stress-related because I had an awful lot going on.
</P>
<P>
   What did seem strange, however, was that, unusual as my voice is
for one on radio, I've always been able to rely on it, even during
other very stressful periods in my life. This was clearly
different.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, there's no known specific cause, there is no cure,
and there is no known reason as to why or how it begins. But there
is research going on all over the country, so someday there may be
more answers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: When did you begin treatments?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: I had my first injection of botox on May 5. As you might
know, botulinum toxin in high doses is absolutely deadly. But the
injections given are about 1,000 times smaller than what they would
need to be to become lethal.
</P>
<P>
   I was injected with .5 units on either side of the throat,
directly into the muscles controlling the vocal cords. Dr. Flint
attached tiny discs to my throat area, so that he could actually
see on a television screen exactly where the needle was going in.
It was uncomfortable, but not intolerable.
</P>
<P>
   The entire experience lasted less than five minutes. When my
husband and I left Johns Hopkins, we took a long, long walk around
the (Baltimore) inner harbor. I felt fine, my voice was still
working.
</P>
<P>
   We had a lovely dinner at the hotel that night, and I slept
well. The next morning, I still had a voice, which continued
through the next day and evening. Then, at 3:30 a.m. the next
morning, I woke up with only the barest whisper, indicating that
the botox had worked.
</P>
<P>
   I woke my husband, and we did a high five!
</P>
<P>
   Today, four weeks after that first botox injection, I have
considerable voice. I spoke with Dr. Flint (last Wednesday), and he
tells me that the incremental improvement . . . will be
considerable.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: What kind of response have you had from listeners?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: The response has just been overwhelming. I spend much of my
days answering e-mail from folks who are wishing me well, wondering
when I'll return and offering prayers for me. I can tell you there
have been hundreds of those messages, in addition to letters and
cards from so many good people. I am so grateful because I know
those prayers and good wishes have made a difference.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: Have you been able to keep up your spirits?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: When I first left the air on Feb. 23, I was pretty down. I
had done my two-hour show that morning, and then had a car waiting
to take me to a downtown hotel, where I moderated a discussion
before about 300 people. I barely made it. My voice had simply
given out. I rushed back to the station, went straight to my
manager, Kim Hodgson, and told him I'd have to take some time off.
. . . I simply could not control my voice any longer.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, I was not optimistic. I thought I would have
to end my radio career much sooner than I had expected to. The
voice therapy was not working, no matter how much I practiced or
how much I tried. I saw a behavioral therapist and a
psychopharmacolgist, who helped me deal with my anxiety and
depression.
</P>
<P>
   Then, finally, my internist, Carole Horn, stepped in and said,
``Enough! I want you to go to Johns Hopkins and see these two
doctors.'' At first, I was annoyed, feeling as though this was just
one more futile effort. But, thank heavens, I've finally gotten a
diagnosis, the correct treatment, and feel as though I'm on a quick
path to recovery.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: How did you recruit so many great people to fill in for you?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: Steve Roberts (syndicated columnist with his wife,
journalist Cokie Roberts, and journalism teacher at George
Washington University) and Susan Page (White House correspondent
for ``USA Today'') have filled in for me over the last several
years whenever I've been on vacation, out sick or off making a
speech.
</P>
<P>
   Now with Jim Angle (White House correspondent for Fox News) and
Tom Gjelton (international correspondent for NPR), we feel so
fortunate to have such a marvelous lineup of people willing to
stand in. It is extremely gratifying to know that these very busy
people are willing to do this for me.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: What occupies your time during your time off the air?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: I spend much time at the computer answering e-mail
(drehm(at)wamu.org). I am also online or on the phone with the
producers of the show many times a day. We talk about various
options for shows, guests and books. Now that I have a voice, I'm
on the phone with them more frequently. I have also written a diary
for ``Slate'' magazine that has now been posted at my Web site
(www.wamu.org), and, as you might imagine, I am continuing to work
on my book.
</P>

DOUGLAS WORKERS EAGER TO SHOW BOEING THEY CAN DO 737 WORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ Standing inside the Boeing next generation
737-700, John Figueira looked down the length of the gutted
fuselage where any day now he and his fellow Douglas aircraft
workers will begin to install the lavatories, galley and seats, and
complete other interior work that must be done before the plane can
be delivered in a few months to Germania Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``This right here is our future, literally,'' he said of the
737. ``All the people on this program realize that.''
</P>
<P>
   The plane is one of five 737s that have been flown down from
Seattle for final interior work and refurbishment at the underused
factory here, which is part of Boeing's Douglas Products Division
as a result of last summer's merger with the McDonnell Douglas
Corp. Five more 737s are still to come as Boeing shifts some work
here in an effort to ease production bottlenecks at the Renton
plant.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing executives also are seriously considering setting up a
737 production line at the Douglas factory later this year. A
decision is expected before summer's end.
</P>
<P>
   The next generation 737-700 is parked next to a standard 737 at
one end of the factory floor of what's known as Building 80. On top
of the building is the landmark sign, ``Fly DC Jets.''
</P>
<P>
   The 737 work area is fenced off from the rest of the factory
floor. Only those with a 737 badge that peeks out from below the
standard-issue Boeing badge are allowed inside to work on the
planes from Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred yards away, at the other end of the factory, a
shiny new 717 is being readied for Wednesday's rollout ceremony.
Boeing executives will be on hand as the company shows off its
first 100-seat passenger jet, formerly called the MD-95 because it
was designed and sold by McDonnell Douglas before the merger.
</P>
<P>
   But the future of the 717 is uncertain. Some analysts believe
Boeing is going to have a hard time selling the plane to airlines
in a niche market. Even if sales live up to Boeing's public
expectations, many of the 10,000 remaining Douglas workers in Long
Beach are destined to lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Boeing announced it would eliminate production of
the MD-80 and MD-90 twinjets that are now built in the same
building as the 717. That will mean the loss of about 3,000 jobs.
The last of the twinjets will roll out the door near the end of
next year.
</P>
<P>
   And less than two weeks ago, Boeing said it would also stop
production in early 2000 of the unprofitable MD-11 widebody trijet,
which is built in an adjacent building. Scratch another 3,000 or so
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 717 is all that we will have left. So we really need that
new 737 line if Douglas is going to make it,'' said Figueira, the
team leader for interior work on the 737s and a 34-year veteran of
Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   Figueira is 60 years old. He plans to retire in two years and
move with his wife to Arizona, where he will fish and play golf.
</P>
<P>
   But his son Charles works at Douglas, in tooling. He's been with
Douglas 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a long ways to go,'' Figueira said of his son. ``This
is his future.'' Assuming, of course, that there is a Douglas
factory.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's tentative plan to start a 737 production line at the
Long Beach factory is strongly opposed by the Machinists union in
Seattle, which represents about 39,000 Boeing workers.
</P>
<P>
   But Figueira and other Douglas workers point out that they now
work for Boeing, too, and if they can help the company, while at
the same time saving a once-great aircraft factory and their jobs,
what's wrong with that?
</P>
<P>
   Two of the first five 737s brought here have already been
finished and are on the flight line. The work was supposed to have
been done in 10 days. It took seven.
</P>
<P>
   After Boeing announced in May that it would transfer some 737
work to Long Beach and was considering a production line, the
Douglas workers who were given special training on the 737 met to
talk about how important it was to make a good impression on
Boeing's corporate office in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are putting their best foot forward and working just as
hard as they can to get that production line,'' said Kedrick Legg,
president of the local unit of the United Aerospace Workers, which
represents about 8,000 Douglas workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to send a clear message to the corporation that this
is a terrific and highly experienced work force down here. In fact,
our experience level is about twice what they have in Seattle.
Given some modern tooling, we could work wonders.''
</P>
<P>
   Aviation legend Donald W. Douglas would roll over in his grave
if he knew the sorry state of the airplane company he founded in
1920, and which merged in 1967 with McDonnell Aircraft Co. of St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The merger never produced the great commercial aviation company
that was supposed to challenge Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   On a cold February morning in 1989, after 20 years of poor
financial performance by the Douglas Aircraft folks, John
McDonnell, chief executive of the merged company and son of the
founder, assembled more than 5,000 managers and executives at the
Douglas plant in Long Beach and told them they had been stripped of
their titles; a new team work program called Total Quality
Management System would be put into place. Each manager would have
to reapply for his or her job and take classes. One Douglas
executive who attended the classes but was told he didn't measure
up to the new way of doing business was James Douglas, also the son
of a company founder.
</P>
<P>
   It was not long before Douglas workers joked that Total Quality
Management System stood for ``Time to Quit and Move to Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, perhaps, Seattle will come to them. And none too soon.
</P>
<P>
   After the merger last year, top Boeing executives were
reportedly shocked to find out how much would be needed to upgrade
the factory to Boeing standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We built the DC-8 the same way we are building planes today,
and that was 30 years ago,'' Figueira said.
</P>
<P>
   Legg, the UAW union local president, toured the Boeing plants in
thePuget Sound area. He was amazed at what he saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like stepping forward 30 years,'' he said. ``All that
new technology and high-speed tooling. ... We have World War II
tooling. It's like walking into a Henry Ford motor plant. ...
That's why I always admired Boeing. They were willing to spend the
money and take chances.''
</P>
<P>
   In April, Figueira was among the first 87 Douglas workers who
were trained on the 737 by Boeing supervisors from Seattle.
Figueira said he was surprised to learn that blueprints of the 737
could easily be examined on a computer. Blueprints for Douglas
planes are not yet computerized for floor workers to study.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had had Boeing's engineering and tooling 10 or 15 years
ago, I really don't believe we would have had a merger,'' he said.
Instead, Douglas would have been a serious competitor.
</P>
<P>
   Beverly O'Neill, the mayor of Long Beach, and other California
politicians are lobbying hard for Boeing to open the 737 line at
the Douglas factory.
</P>
<P>
   The California Trade and Commerce Agency has prepared a
multimillion-dollar package of economic incentives to encourage
Boeing to permanently shift some 737 work from Seattle to Long
Beach.
</P>
<P>
   McDonnell Douglas was Long Beach's largest employer. In 1989,
the work force totaled more than 40,000. Now, it's less than half
that, including the 8,000 Douglas workers who build the C-17
transport plane for the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   ``The MD line is slowly leaving,'' the mayor said in an
interview Tuesday. ``We are doing everything we can to maintain the
strength we have currently. We are doing everything we can to let
Boeing know this is an outstanding work force and vitally important
to our city.''

   These are the weddings you'll never read about in the
untarnished world of bridal magazines: weddings in which a jealous
ex-lover sets fire to the newlyweds' limousine, the bride's
embittered divorced parents ignite a brawl, the couple's dog
relieves himself accompanying them down the aisle, the bride is
mugged in the ladies' room ... Take a side-splitting walk on the

   Woodham, society columnist for the Atlanta Journal and

of wedding etiquette. Can the bride walk down the aisle alone? Can
her mother be matron of honor? Can the bride ask a guy to be one of
her attendants? With humor and commonsense, Woodham tackles these
and other thorny questions head-on. (slugged:

   Newlyweds may discover that the person whom they love has
domestic habits that they hate. What if the bride is a neatnik and
the groom is a slob? What if he can't bear to talk to anyone when
he first wakes up and she is all bubbly? Even bathroom habits, such
as how one squeezes the toothpaste tube and whether to leave the
toilet seat up or down, can cause domestic turmoil. DeMorier offers
ideas on how to keep the home from turning into a battleground.

 By DEBBI J. KARPOWICZ  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Cakes topple. Drunken relatives fight. Brides turn out to be
allergic to their flowers. Gowns and tuxes don't arrive in time.
 &HT;    These are some of the mishaps that can beset a wedding, no
matter how carefully it is planned. Even wedding coordinators admit
that some things are beyond their control.
 &HT;    For example, Phyllis Block, head of the wedding team at The
World Trade Center in Boston, once handled a wedding at which the
couple's dog walked down the aisle _ and relieved himself.
 &HT;    Toni deLisi, a consultant in Waldwick, N.J., once planned a
wedding at The Plaza Hotel in New York, only to have thieves steal
the flowers from the delivery truck parked on Fifth Avenue.
 &HT;    Then there are times when things go really awry: Guests have
fistfights and get arrested. An ex-girlfriend sets the limo on
fire.
 &HT;    If anyone has seen couples get hitched _ with about every hitch
possible _ it's the Rev. Dennis James Robinson, a justice of the
peace and Unitarian minister based in Hopkinton, Mass.
 &HT;    Robinson, who performed 327 weddings in 1997, once married a
couple in a Jacuzzi filled with orange Jell-O. It involved 72
packets of gelatin, 268 gallons of water and a canoe-paddle
stirrer.
 &HT;    At one wedding over which Robinson presided, the bride's
divorced parents were on bad terms. After the groom's father gave
an emotional toast to the newlyweds, the bride's embittered father
grabbed the microphone and launched into a tirade.
 &HT;    ``I just wanted to let you all know that my ex-wife is a no-good
 !!% !%!,'' he ranted. Everyone gasped, as he continued, ``I also
wanted you all to know that I contributed to this wedding.''
 &HT;    He was interrupted by his ex-wife, who shot back, ``No, you
didn't, you  !!%!'' The ex-wife then jumped up, grabbed her
ex-husband's throat and punched him in the stomach.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, the ex-husband's new girlfriend clawed at the ex-wife
with her fingernails, while both reached for the microphone to use
as a weapon.
 &HT;    The fight eventually spilled out into the parking lot. When all
was said and done, 11 people were arrested.
 &HT;    Another time, Robinson officiated at a ceremony on a patio
overlooking a golf course. During the nuptials, he realized there
was a ruckus behind him, but he didn't dare turn around. When it
came time for the bride to say her vows, a breathy voice in back of
him yelled, ``I do.''
 &HT;    It was the groom's ex-girlfriend, decked out in a wedding gown,
determined to get revenge. Pandemonium broke out faster than you
can say ``Fatal Attraction.'' The groom then warned everyone to be
careful, as his former flame had recently broken into his house,
trashed it and slit his car tires.
 &HT;    When the chauffeur left the limousine for a moment, the angry ex
took lighter fluid, wrote ``I Love You'' on the hood of the car and
set it on fire.
 &HT;    ``I left before I heard what happened next,'' Robinson says.
 &HT;    Another memorable affair was an Irish wedding at which the
budget-conscious couple relied on a relative and a boom box instead
of hiring professional musicians. Unfortunately, Uncle Joe got
inebriated and played tunes that were inappropriate, to say the
least. The parents danced to ``Send in the Clowns,'' the newlyweds
waltzed to ``The Stripper'' and the groom and his mother danced to
``Do It to Me One More Time.''
 &HT;    Doug Giordano, director of food and beverage at New Jersey's
Woodcliff Lake Hilton, once had a bride who was assaulted by
strangers in the restroom.
 &HT;    This happened at another hotel, where the ballroom and the bar
shared a restroom. Apparently, three jealous _ and intoxicated _
female customers came upon the happy bride in the bathroom, held
her against the wall and burned holes into her gown with their
cigarettes.
 &HT;    At another wedding that Giordano handled, three rap stars, who
had just performed at The Meadowlands, returned to their hotel and,
out of boredom, crashed the wedding in the ballroom. They ran out
onto the dance floor and started to sing and dance, Giordano
recalls. When one of the bridesmaids confronted them, it evolved
into a fistfight ``with split lips, black eyes and five police
cars,'' he says.
 &HT;    At least there were no threats of bullets. Teddy Lenderman, a
wedding coordinator in Terre Haute, Ind., wore a bulletproof vest
for one of the weddings she worked on _ as did the priest, groom
and several members of the wedding party.
 &HT;    Apparently, the groom's irrational mother didn't like the bride,
and told him, ``If you marry her, I'm going to come in and blow you
all away.''
 &HT;    No one took Mom seriously _ until she showed up at a relative's
funeral, where she slapped the corpse and slammed the casket shut.
When the funeral director approached her, she kicked him and broke
his leg in three places.
 &HT;    On the day before the wedding, she called the rectory five times
and threatened the clergyman with bodily harm.
 &HT;    On the wedding day, the nervous groom called his mom and forbade
her to come.
 &HT;    ``She didn't show,'' Lenderman says. ``But in my 14 years of
business, at that point, I had never experienced anything so
nerve-wracking.''
 &HT;    The bride was the tremulous one at a wedding attended by Barbara
Sheehan, an executive at The Royal Hawaiian in Hawaii.
 &HT;    Sheehan recalls that the bride got halfway down the aisle, then
turned around to ask one of her bridesmaids a question:
 &HT;    ``You can learn to love someone, can't you?''

 &UR; By MARTHA A. WOODHAM &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; From ``The Bride Did What?!''
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Brides and grooms get so much advice _ most of it wrong _ that
they panic. It's like having a baby: As soon as people find out
you're expecting a wedding, they feel free to tell you what to do
and give dire warnings about being improper _ i.e., tacky.
</P>
<P>
   Your mother is sure she knows what's correct. Your beloved's
mother has her own ideas, and your neighbor down the street can't
wait to tell you horror stories about the tacky weddings she's
attended. You begin to feel queasy at the thought of ``Your Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, worry no more. Here are the Top Ten Marriage Myths _ and
the right answers, no matter what anyone says. Folks will swear
these myths are the eternal Etiquette Truth etched in stone and
handed down by some Etiquette God. Well, they aren't.
</P>
<P>
   1. The bride and groom must ask their siblings to be bridesmaids
and groomsmen.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is customary to ask brothers and sisters to be
attendants, the bride and groom are free to ask whomever they wish
_ best friends, pals from the office, a buddy from a favorite bar.
</P>
<P>
   But beware: This could be deadly. Friends come and go, while
your families are there forever. You avoid a lot of hurt feelings
by asking brothers and sisters.
</P>
<P>
   Tacky brides wail, ``But I don't feel close to his sisters. I
want my friends instead.'' A wedding is a great place to get
acquainted. After the ``I do's,'' those strangers will be your
sisters, too.
</P>
<P>
   2. The bride must be escorted down the aisle and given away by
someone.
</P>
<P>
   Being given away is a tradition that evolved from the days when
men bought brides from their fathers or, even worse, captured them.
Today many young women feel this custom is archaic. Somehow it was
charming when a woman went from her father's home directly to her
new husband's, but that's not true of most couples today.
</P>
<P>
   With so many women going to college, supporting themselves and
marrying later, being ``given away'' seems terribly out-of-date.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't want it, leave it out of the ceremony. And if you
choose, walk down the aisle by yourself. Not every bride has a
father, nor does every bride like her father. Some brides say going
solo made them feel like royalty.
</P>
<P>
   3. The bride's father must sit in the first pew with the bride's
mother, even if they hate the sight of each other.
</P>
<P>
   In a perfect world, divorced mothers and fathers would overcome
their loathing so all could be sweetness and light on their child's
wedding day.
</P>
<P>
   Let's get real. Divorce is a 1990s fact of life. When divorced
parents get along, it's wonderful. Mom and Dad can sit together,
one big happy parental unit on the first pew.
</P>
<P>
   This changes if stepparents are in the picture. Mom _ and her
new husband _ should sit in the first pew. Dad _ and his new wife _
should sit in the next pew.
</P>
<P>
   If they do not get along, Dad and his new wife should sit even
farther back in the church _ far enough away to avoid bodily harm.
(All of this goes for the groom's parents, too.)
</P>
<P>
   4. The number of groomsmen must equal the number of bridesmaids.
</P>
<P>
   So who's counting? Unlike many other areas of modern life, there
is no rule that says a wedding party must have equality.
</P>
<P>
   An equal number of men and women makes a pretty picture at the
altar _ and makes life easier for the wedding consultant _ but this
is not mandatory. You can have all men, all women _ even all
children if you like.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be politically correct at your wedding.
</P>
<P>
   5. A bride cannot ask her mother to be the matron of honor.
</P>
<P>
   If a father can be a best man, there is no reason a mother can't
be matron of honor. It's a beautiful, loving gesture.
</P>
<P>
   The only drawback is if the wedding is a very large one. The
mother of the bride and the matron of honor each may have so many
duties that it could be a burden to ask your mom to undertake both
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But if a bride's mom is extremely organized and is her best
friend, she should ask her.
</P>
<P>
   6. A bride cannot ask her mother to escort her down the aisle.
</P>
<P>
   If a father can escort his daughter, there is no reason a mother
can't. More and more brides are asking their moms to make the
stroll down the aisle instead of bench-warming the first pew. This
custom is borrowed from Jewish ceremonies, where both parents
escort the bride and groom.
</P>
<P>
   It is a lovely gesture, and most moms are thrilled to be asked.
</P>
<P>
   7. A flower girl must be under age 6.
</P>
<P>
   The littler they are, the cuter they are _ and the more they can
disrupt your ceremony! The same goes for ring bearers.
</P>
<P>
   Flower girls have refused to go down the aisle or toss their
petals. One little ring bearer grabbed the flower girl's basket,
dumped the petals in a pile and began jumping on it.
</P>
<P>
   And my mom loves to tell of when I was a flower girl: At a
crucial moment in the ceremony, I stage-whispered, ``Mommy, I have
to tee-tee.''
</P>
<P>
   The only criterion for the job of flower girl or ring bearer
should be how important a child is to you. If the little girl or
little boy is someone you want to include, by all means do it, no
matter how old _ or young _ the child is.
</P>
<P>
   8. Brides and grooms must pick attendants who are close to their
own age.
</P>
<P>
   No, the only requirement for being an attendant is a sincere
attachment to the bride or groom _ and the ability to pay for the
clothing.
</P>
<P>
   I know of brides in their 20s who had bridesmaids in their 60s,
and the weddings were full of love and rejoicing.
</P>
<P>
   9. A pregnant woman cannot be a bridesmaid.
</P>
<P>
   It is a mystery to me why it is considered poor manners to have
a pregnant woman participate in a ceremony so full of fertility
symbols.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, bridesmaids were young women who surrounded the
bride to confuse any evil spirits lurking about. Perhaps a
bridesmaid had to be fleet-footed, and it's hard to run when you
are pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   I see no problems with asking a friend who is with child, other
than logistical ones: She may have trouble fitting into her dress,
and she may feel uncomfortable standing for long periods of time.
</P>
<P>
   10. There can be only one maid of honor and one matron of honor.
</P>
<P>
   A bride may have two of either if she wishes. And she doesn't
have to limit herself to women.
</P>
<P>
   If the bride's best friend is a guy, she should ask him. But she
shouldn't call him, as one Atlanta bride did, her ``mister of
honor.''

   &UR; EDITORS: In honor of Father's Day on June 21, The New York Times
Syndicate looks at the changing institution of fatherhood from many
perspectives. We examine the conflicts men face balancing work and
family, and the trend toward becoming fathers in middle age. We
offer two essays by dads anticipating Father's Day: one nostalgic
and one humorous. And for those dads who love to hit the links, Jim
McKay picks his ten top golfers.

 &UR; (1,600 words) &QL; 
 &UR; By JAMES A. LEVINE AND TODD L. PITTINKSY &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; From Child magazine &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Much is written about the struggles of working women balancing
work and family. But what about the working dad? In the 1990s, more
and more fathers want to play a significant role in rearing their
children, but the workplace is not always so accommodating. Levine
and Pittinsky describe how a father's work affects his family and
vice versa, and offer suggestions on how to achieve a better
balance. (slugged:

</P>
<P>
   As many women have children later in life and divorced men
remarry and have second families, many men in theIR late 40s, 50s
and 60s are finding themselves the fathers of newborns. They may
get mistaken for grandfathers, but this new breed of fathers brings
a fresh new perspective to fatherhood, the authors say, often
valuing their children as much or even more than work. But older
fathers also face doubts about whether it's fair to raise a young
child at an advanced age. (slugged:

   This Father's Day, Herrera's children have asked him to take
them to see ``Godzilla.'' The request evokes memories of his own
childhood, when he and his dad would go to the movies on Father's
Day, a rare time for them to be together, just the two of them.
``The time a child spends alone with his or her father is special.
Too often it's taken for granted by both parent and child,''
Herrera says. (slugged:

<P>
   Lying in bed before dawn on Father's Day, Applegate dreams of
sneaking out for a quick round of golf. He alternates between
musings about life as a golf pro and counting the blessings in his
own life. Good sense prevails: ``There are those Sundays when
abandoning your family to play golf is maybe just a little sick.
Father's Day is one, Mother's Day definitely another.'' (slugged:

 c.1998 Elegant Wedding, published by Philadelphia magazine.
<TEXT>
<P>
   His parents: ``Your turkey is dry, you didn't take the family
name and you're five years older than him.''
</P>
<P>
   Your parents: ``He's not your religion, he's supporting an
ex-wife and child and you make more money than he does.''
</P>
<P>
   And if either of your parents nudges you about wanting
grandchildren one more time ...
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the line between amicability and all-out war can be
thin where in-laws are concerned. With practice, though, experts
say, you can learn to get along ... and the sooner the better.
</P>
<P>
   Intruding in-laws are a mainstay on the marital trouble list,
says Marlene Watson, a couples-and-family therapist in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents never stop being protective or wanting the best for
their child,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, she explains, one partner may feel that an in-law is
interfering and his or her spouse is not doing anything about it.
Then, to make matters worse, the spouse feels he or she is being
attacked by the partner and pressured by one or both sets of
parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Battle No. 1 is, `Where's your primary loyalty?''' says
Watson, who is also director of the couples-and-family therapy
graduate program at Allegheny University of the Health Sciences in
Philadelphia. ``Your primary allegiance needs to be with your
partner, but you can't exclude parents.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to riding out most in-law conflicts is to act as a
united couple, Watson says. Both partners need to set up boundaries
and communicate them to the in-laws. This could mean asking your
mother not to call before 9:30 a.m. on weekends or telling your
father-in-law that your financial affairs are a private matter.
</P>
<P>
   It's also important not to put down your spouse's parent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This makes the partner defensive and rally to the side of the
parent,'' Watson says. Instead, explain to your mate what the
problem is and involve him or her in suggesting ways to resolve the
conflict.
 &UR; COUPLES AT RISK: WHO ISN'T? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Few people sail into in-law relationships without some
apprehension and discomfort at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marriage is a transition for everyone,'' Watson says.
``You're bringing together two sets of rules, and each family feels
its rules should be followed.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet many of these differences are arbitrary and not really
important, says Michael Ascher, a psychologist and professor of
psychiatry at Temple University School of Medicine. For instance,
he says, while a new bride may disapprove of her in-laws'
predinner-cocktail ritual, she can learn to accept that it isn't
tantamount to alcoholism.
</P>
<P>
   Studies indicate that younger people have more problems relating
to their in-laws than those over 35.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents and in-laws play a more significant role with younger
people, for whom conflicts about independence and autonomy still
exist,'' Ascher notes.
</P>
<P>
   In-law tensions may erupt as soon as the couple announces the
engagement. Parents may feel abandoned and experience anxiety about
the impending separation. There may be discomfort about
acknowledging their child's sexuality. They may fear adverse
changes in the family structure. Or differences in the new
son-in-law or daughter-in-law may be perceived as a threat or
rejection of their own values.
</P>
<P>
   Penny Bilofsky, a Cherry Hill, N.J.-based psychotherapist and
co-author of ``Inlaws/Outlaws: How to Make Peace with His Family
and Yours'' (Villard Books, 1991), encourages newlyweds to reassure
their parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heavy doses of `I love you, I will always love you and I will
always be your child' go a long way toward easing a parent's
troubled heart,'' she writes.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly if the bride is older than her husband, his mother
may feel that her daughter-in-law is trying to usurp her role. Or a
new wife may become anxious that the undesirable qualities she
observes in her new father-in-law will be transferred to his son.
And don't overlook potential sibling-in-law problems, Watson says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Siblings can have as major an impact on the couple as
parents,'' she says. `` They may call to ask for money, become very
protective or take a strong dislike to the in-law.''
</P>
<P>
   Before you meet your in-laws, have your fiance brief you about
their likes, dislikes and sensitivities. The added knowledge will
reduce the risk of your offending them and enable you to ask
questions that engage their interest.
 &UR; POTENTIAL SORE SPOTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   + Wedding planning.
</P>
<P>
   If a couple pays for all the arrangements, they may have things
exactly as they wish, Watson says. If parents are financing the
affair, though, the couple should be prepared to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   + Juggling families.
</P>
<P>
   One newlywed says the biggest adjustment has been getting used
to the visitation demands of her husband's large, very close
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked into this huge family who did everything together. My
family felt like I was always with my husband's family for
birthdays, Sunday dinners and holidays,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, she says, she had to deal with ``the insanity of
having to be at both sets of parents' homes for every holiday.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the couple announced they were alternating: They
would spend Thanksgiving and Christmas Day with her family, and
Christmas Eve and Easter with his folks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fourth of July is up for grabs!'' she says with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Another time when both had sisters celebrating birthdays on the
same day, the couple simply agreed to split up so each could attend
his or her own family's party.
</P>
<P>
   + Negotiating.
</P>
<P>
   The experts agree that it is wise to deal with your own parents
about sensitive issues such as financial requests or choosing baby
names, especially early in the marriage. Not only do you know your
parents' quirks, but any resulting anger and annoyance is more
likely to be forgiven and forgotten with you than with your spouse,
Ascher says.
</P>
<P>
   Once you know your in-laws better, try to handle disagreements
yourself without putting your spouse in the middle. Find a tactful
way to ask that your mother-in-law call before dropping in. Or
state firmly that family-planning decisions are between you and
your husband.
</P>
<P>
   + Money.
</P>
<P>
   Asking parents for money can set the stage for disputes about
how the gift is used and how you're living your life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't accept large gifts unless you're willing to accept the
negatives that may go with them,'' Ascher advises. ``If you accept
a house down payment, expect visits and interference. Decide if
it's worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   + Criticism.
</P>
<P>
   If one of your parents is making derogatory statements about
your spouse, your first priority is to your husband or wife. A
parent should be told that he or she doesn't have to love your
spouse, but must respect your choice.
</P>
<P>
   Don't tolerate your spouse criticizing your parents, and don't
let your in-laws play you against your spouse.
</P>
<P>
   + Cold shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Even if your family ignores your spouse in conversations and
activities, continue to include him or her in important events and
discussions. Maintain a separate relationship with your parents,
too, such as having lunch sometimes, Watson recommends.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may just have to give a parent time,'' she says. ``Stay in
there and have faith.''
</P>
<P>
   What if you plain don't like one of your in-laws?
</P>
<P>
   ``Your best bet is to be patient, cordial and mannerly,''
according to Bilofsky. ``You have a loved one in common. Do it for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   If all else fails, she adds, ``Remind yourself that your in-laws
must have done something right _ look at the child they raised.''

 &HT;    
 By EVERETT DeMORIER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 From ``Crib Notes for the First Year of Marriage''  
 &HT;    Whether you've been living together since junior high school or
spent your first night together on your honeymoon, the agenda for
the first year of marriage is pretty much the same. Just when you
thought you knew your spouse better than your spouse knew himself
or herself, you're really meeting each other for the first time.
 &HT;    Many young couples tend to see married life as an extension of
single life, with an additional person. But as soon as two people
step across the marriage threshold, with sweater-drying rack and
dartboard in hand, two sets of histories and expectations must
join.
 &HT;    Studies of marriage show there is no correlation between an easy
first year of marriage and living together prior to being married,
but living together does get a few of those
put-the-old-milk-carton-in-front-of-the-new-one-so-we-use-the-
old-one-first type of rules out of the way. Some of them, but not
all.
 &HT;    Below are some of the most common issues in the first year of
marriage, and some suggestions for how couples can deal with them.
 &HT;    + Feeling at home.
 &HT;    Having a housewarming or a dinner party is a great way to make a
new home your own, whether you have moved in with your spouse or
the two of you have moved into a new home together. Having friends
and family there to see you in your new surroundings can create a
sense of pride in your home, and a feeling of ease and comfort.
 &HT;    Sometimes it's the little things that help establish roots, such
as being the voice on the answering machine, planting a garden or
making friends with the neighbors.
 &HT;    + The slob factor.
 &HT;    If your spouse's housekeeping skills leave a bit to be desired,
if clothes and dishes pave a path from the couch to the
refrigerator, the pile method is a great alternative to bashing
your spouse with a tire iron.
 &HT;    The pile method simply involves picking a neutral location _ a
desk, a dresser, a closet, somewhere you can live with a mess _ and
placing all the wallets, car keys, dirty socks, magazines, dishes
and so forth in that place.
 &HT;    This works for the ``neatnik,'' because everything can be picked
up and deposited quickly, and it works for the slob because
everything is in one place. Note: This is a treatment, not a cure.
 &HT;    + The clash of expectations.
 &HT;    Sit down and discuss in detail how you expect your life as a
couple to be. Maybe your mental picture is unrealistic. You won't
know until it's out in the open. Be specific.
 &HT;    Do you expect coffee to be brought to you in the morning like
your father did for your mother? Do you expect your mate to be home
exactly at 5 o'clock? Do you expect to be able to have friends over
every night?
 &HT;    The majority of newlyweds' fights occur when one spouse is not
acting the way the other spouse expects. But no one, not even
Robert Duvall, can act without a script.
 &HT;    + The age-old toothpaste dilemma.
 &HT;    This type of conflict is quite normal and really simple to
resolve when you get right down to it. If your mate insists on
leaving the cap off the toothpaste, or worse, squeezing the tube in
the middle (gasp!), just buy two tubes of toothpaste.
 &HT;    To solve the problem of whether to roll the toilet paper over or
under _ believe it or not, this actually accounted for an entire
segment on Oprah _ try installing two rollers.
 &HT;    Of course, having separate bathrooms would solve not only both
these problems but also that perennial problem in the battle of the
sexes: Should the toilet seat be left up or down?
 &HT;    The best advice is just to get over it. Sure, you think the
world would be a lot better place if your mate would just ... But
would it really?
 &HT;    Personal habits take some getting used to. Any two people need
time to adjust to each other, a new lifestyle and new surroundings.
Relax. A routine will develop soon enough, and you will quickly
forget that you were ever uncomfortable.
 &HT;    + ``Don't talk to me before I have my coffee.''
 &HT;    There are morning people and there are night people. And then
there are peppy morning people. If you've married one of those
people who pop out of bed, draw open the shades and sing in the
shower ... first of all, my condolences. On the other hand, your
mate is probably a happy person, which may be why you fell in love
with him or her in the first place.
 &HT;    + ``Isn't the game over yet?''
 &HT;    Husbands watching sports all weekend is one of the most frequent
complaints heard from newlywed women. While women often complain
about their husband's sports-viewing habits, however, many women
actually like watching sports on television, particularly with
their mates. Where couples run into trouble is when watching sports
occupies the entire weekend.
 &HT;    One possible solution is planning specific games and sports to
watch, rather than just watching anything that's on.
 &HT;    Here are some other solutions:
 &HT;    Have a sports party. Invite friends or other couples over to
watch the game.
 &HT;    Participate in a sport together. Join a volleyball team or a
bowling league. Take up tennis or golf. Being involved in a sport
makes it more interesting to watch it on television.
 &HT;    Go to the sporting event together. Rather than lounge in the
easy chair all day Saturday, buy tickets to the local college
football game and make a day of it.
 &HT;    Go do something else on your weekend time together, and listen
to the game on the way.
 &HT;    + Sharing the covers.
 &HT;    There's not much people can do to change their behaviors when
they're fast asleep. Thus, newlyweds often complain about the
spouse's snoring, hogging the covers or kicking them in the middle
of the night.
 &HT;    There are some things both partners can do before falling
asleep, however, that can reduce the occurrence of cover stealing.
For instance, if the partner who steals the blankets dresses more
warmly for bed, he or she may not be as likely to feel cold during
the night. Likewise, if the partner who ends up without covers
during the night dresses more warmly, he or she will not mind as
much when the covers disappear.
 &HT;    Another solution would be to keep an emergency blanket next to
the bed so that whoever finds himself or herself without covers
during the night can use a substitute blanket.
 &HT;    For a more romantic option, try sleeping closer together. Body
heat is better than a blanket any day.

`GIRL POWER' PROPELS TODAY'S COUNTRY DIVAS DOWN NEW PATHS

   They wear navel rings, spandex pants and sexy crop-tops.
</P>
<P>
   They strut through music videos that, volume turned down, you'd
swear belong on MTV. They sing about everything from AIDS to
jiltin' a deadbeat guy to standin' up for yourself, girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any man of mine better walk the line,'' belts out Shania
Twain.
</P>
<P>
   Mindy McCready, whose trademark is a bellybutton ring, has a
song called ``Guys Do It All the Time,'' where she gleefully
describes a woman doing everything from driving a pickup to
watching football.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Independence Day,'' Martina McBride sings about a battered
wife who decides to fight back.
</P>
<P>
   Meet today's women of country music. Brazen. Beautiful. Ballsy.
Stand by your man? Yeah, right. ``Girl power'' has become the
mantra for many of these '90s singers. Gone are the frilly,
high-necked dresses, the big hair and fringed skirts, the saintly
tolerance of their men's cheatin' hearts.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you compare Loretta Lynn and Tammy Wynette to Shania
Twain and Mindy McCready _ wow, what a difference,'' says Bev
Devlin, a Seattle traffic announcer and country singer. ``The
gingham and plaid of Dolly Parton are long gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Twain, 33, performs Saturday at the Tacoma Dome.
</P>
<P>
   With her in-your-face lyrics, sexy, modern look and country-pop
sound finessed by husband Mutt Lange _ former producer for rock
bands such as AC/DC and Def Leppard _ Twain ushered in a new era of
country diva.
</P>
<P>
   Her signature hit: ``Any Man of Mine,'' which has become an
anthem of sorts for young, female country fans.
</P>
<P>
   I can be late for a date, that's fine. But he better be on time.
And if I change my mind a million times, I wanna hear him say,
yeah, yeah, yeah, I like it that way ...
</P>
<P>
   ``The images have changed dramatically,'' says Pat Roberts, a
local concert promoter who brings acts such as Reba McEntire and
Wynonna to the Seattle area. ``Before, there wasn't near the
glamour there is today. The girl-singer was more the
girl-next-door.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's female country stars _ with their feisty, empowering
lyrics and sexy stage acts _ also appeal to a younger, wider
audience, says Bruce Feiler, author of ``Dreaming Out Loud: Garth
Brooks, Wynonna Judd, Wade Hayes and the Changing Face of
Nashville.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider LeAnn Rimes, who sings about ``commitment,'' wears
trendy slip dresses and does a cover of Prince's ``Purple Rain'' on
her latest album.
</P>
<P>
   Or Trisha Yearwood, who does Discover Card commercials in hip,
baggy jeans and platform shoes. Deana Carter performs barefoot, her
blond hair long and hippie-style. Her best-known song? ``Did I
Shave My Legs for This?''
</P>
<P>
   Jo Dee Messina says adios to a lover in ``Bye Bye,'' singing:
</P>
<P>
   I'll catch you later. Got my lead foot on my accelerator and the
rearview mirror torn off. I ain't never lookin' back. And that's a
fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``The South was much more isolated from the rest of the country
in 1968 than it is in 1998,'' Feiler says. ``There was a much
greater difference between Janis Joplin and Loretta Lynn than there
is between Alanis Morissette and Deana Carter. Today, women in
Seattle can identify with music coming out of Tennessee. This was
something unthinkable 30 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in many ways, today's women of country music do exactly
what their pioneering predecessors did. They sing from the heart
about subjects that matter to women.
</P>
<P>
   In 1952, Kitty Wells became the first woman to have a No. 1
country song with ``It Wasn't God Who Made Honky-Tonk Angels.'' The
tune was a rebuttal to a Hank Thompson song that blamed women for
men's cheating. Ahem.
</P>
<P>
   Dubbed the ``Queen of Country Music,'' Wells blazed a path for
later stars such as Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn and Tammy Wynette.
</P>
<P>
   Now 78, she recalled that in her day, she was lucky to tour with
her husband, Johnny Wright.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had to be very careful when you traveled, or people would
talk about you,'' she says in a phone interview from her Nashville
home. ``Now, the girls go out and have their own buses and people
don't talk about it _ one girl traveling with a bunch of men.''
</P>
<P>
   Back then, there were few women making it big in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't think about having any obstacles,'' she says.
``I just started singing. It was hard to get a recording contract
at first. But once I had it, it got easier for girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Other early female stars raised eyebrows by singing about
controversial subjects.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, Tammy Wynette recorded ``D-I-V-O-R-C-E,'' about a
subject that most people still considered taboo. In 1972, Loretta
Lynn (who had her first baby at 14) celebrated new-fangled birth
control in ``The Pill.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, performers such as Reba McEntire follow in their
footsteps. She sings about a woman infected with HIV in ``She
Thinks His Name Was John.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Loretta Lynn, Tammy Wynette, Dottie West, Patsy Cline _ for
their time, they were as powerful a voice for women as a Reba or a
Trisha or a Faith Hill today,'' says Penny Coyne, a DJ and music
director at radio station KYCW, 96.5 Young Country. ``The way they
went about it may have been different.''
</P>
<P>
   But more often than not, fans of early country remember the
torch songs, the ``my man done left me'' songs. Patsy Cline's ``I
Fall to Pieces.'' Tammy Wynette's ``Stand by Your Man.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Riverside Inn in Tukwila, Linne Bourget takes a break
from two-stepping and line-dancing to muse on the evolution of
country's women.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be `He can beat me and kick me, and I don't
mind,''' says the psychologist and country fan. ``Now there's a lot
more wisdom. The songs are much more psychologically healthy.
There's still an occasional victim song. But Reba (McEntire) and
the Judds, they're the epitome of female wisdom.''
</P>
<P>
   But country music has always been filled with smart women.
</P>
<P>
   Dolly Parton may have played up her bosom and big blond wigs.
She may have sung ``It's All Wrong, But It's All Right'' about
tolerating a bad relationship. But she's also a savvy entrepreneur
behind the scenes and the voice of the spunky hit ``9 to 5.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She's nobody's bimbo,'' says Tony Thomas, music director at
country radio station KMPS. ``She's one of the most successful
businesswomen. And she's not afraid to play with her sexuality
because in the end, she's the one going to the bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Sex has always sold well in rock music. But aside from vamps
such as Parton and Tanya Tucker, country women's images have been
more conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with greater competition among female singers and a more
liberal mentality in Nashville, rising hemlines, exposed
bellybuttons and racier lyrics are in.
</P>
<P>
   ``In society at large, sex is selling,'' says Ray Randall, of
Asylum Records. ``Country music finally brought it to the forefront
with people like Shania and Mindy. In the '90s, you have a more
outspoken female perspective, and it shows up in the lyrics of the
songs.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Loretta Lynn sang, ``You ain't woman enough to
take my man.'' Today's divas of country would likely say, ``Girl,
you can have him.''

   &UR; By MARTIN CARNOY AND DAVID CARNOY &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; (From ``Fathers of a Certain Age'') &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   It is Saturday morning, 6:30 a.m., and a faint light is
beginning to creep through the blinds of the master bedroom where
two figures are sleeping peacefully in their queen-sized bed.
Suddenly, they hear the creaking of a door hinge.
</P>
<P>
   One of the figures in the bed stirs, turning over onto his back.
This is Adam, who, somewhere in his confused semi-consciousness,
feels a weight on his body and then his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daddy,'' a tiny voice says next to his ear, ``it's time to get
up. It's light out.''
</P>
<P>
   Adam groans, his eyes still closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go back to sleep, honey,'' he manages to say. ``It's
nighttime.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, still without moving, not addressing anyone in particular:
``Can't you do something about this? I'm 54 years old and there's a
child sitting on my head at 6:30 in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Adam says that on mornings like these, he feels as if he's
living in a lost episode of ``The Twilight Zone.'' He is a member
of a fast-growing group of men who are fathering in their late 40s,
50s and even 60s. At a time when they should be basking in the
midafternoon sun of lives well lived, these men are raising young
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are mornings when I'll wake up _ I most likely, get
awakened,'' says Adam, ``and I'll say to myself, where the hell am
I? And who's this insane person in my body who's doing this? And
then I realize, it's me. I'm the insane person.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time he's had his morning coffee, that attitude has begun
to improve. And by midafternoon _ the time he usually takes his son
to the park _ he feels quite good about himself and the decision
he's made.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny, but I don't see myself as any older than those
guys over there,'' he tells us, pointing to a couple of men in
their early 30s playing with their children nearby. ``Sure, at some
level I know I look like Alex's grandfather, and sometimes I catch
strange looks, but in my mind's eye, I'm no different than they are
_ just another father in the park.''
</P>
<P>
   Adam is typical of these fathers ``of a certain age.'' They have
always been around, but now there seem to be a lot more of them.
They are the grayheads standing in line at the supermarket or the
folks you mistake for grandparents at the local nursery school.
</P>
<P>
   The rapid increase of middle-aged fathers and the growing _ and,
many would say, inappropriate _ interest in fathering relatively
late in a man's life are mainly the result of delayed childbearing
by many professional women and the rise in the divorce rate. And
technology has made it much more possible today for older women _
and their older husbands _ to have children even if the wife is not
significantly younger than the husband.
</P>
<P>
   It all sounds like fun _ older men finding new meaning in life
and women attaining professional success first and then having
families, too.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone agrees that it is such a good thing. Those who
object see older parents as acting selfishly, against the interest
of the children they choose to parent. They do not find the
grayheads with preschoolers cute. For many Americans, middle-aged
parents are just one more symbol of the decay of traditional values
and the growing selfishness that puts misplaced self-satisfaction
ahead of the greater social good.
 &UR; THE GREAT MORAL DEBATE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter is an everyday miracle,'' a friend in his 50s
tells us, smiling. Steve has three grown children, all boys, from
his first marriage, and a girl, age 2, from his second.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't take the incredible gift of a child for granted when
you are in late middle age,'' Steve goes on. ``The unfolding of
life has to be savored _ observed carefully, contemplated and
understood _ when your own mortality confronts you daily in the
unforgiving reality of the early morning mirror. My attachment to
my daughter also has an immediacy and unconditionality that seems
more like what mothers are supposed to feel. I have discovered real
parenting skills, the ones I was too busy to work on when I was
climbing the so-called ladder of economic and social success.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve and others who are fathering second families tend to talk
a lot about the difference in feelings and commitment they have
this second time around. Fathers in their late 40s, 50s and beyond
tend to value children as much as their work, and often more. They
seem to spend more time with their children than younger fathers.
Some have retired from the working world completely and take on
roles as stay-at-home parents while their younger wives go to
full-time jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But with all the intensity of later fatherhood, the new role is
not easy. The self-indulgence of late middle age bumps against the
energies of a new life demanding attention. Even if an older father
may not be as concerned with competing at work, and much more
concerned with discovering his emotions, he often wants to focus on
himself, his wife, his children from an earlier marriage or his
grandchildren _ all of which can be tough competition against the
needs of his still-young child.
</P>
<P>
   One older father, Larry, was talking to the wife of an old
friend when the conversation turned abruptly to older parents. The
woman was obviously disturbed by the notion that Larry and other
men her husband's age are fathering young children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine Alan (her son) today, at 27,'' she said, quite
agitated, ``if he had been born to a father in his 50s. Suppose his
father had even lived that long, he would be 80. Could a man 80
years old provide the emotional support that a typical kid like
Alan still needs in his 20s? Could that same father at 70 have had
any meaningful connection with a teenager?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt it,'' she said. ``More likely, Alan would now have to
be taking care of an old man with serious health problems. I don't
think kids in their 20s are ready to do that. They should not have
to do it. They should be free to think about themselves. God knows,
the ego trip ends soon enough, why make them take on the worry of
aging parents when they should be exploring life?
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know what it is to lose a parent when you are
young,'' she continued, getting angrier. ``I lost my mother when I
was 21, and I never got over it. It is devastating and unfair.
Sure, it happens even when you are born to young parents like I
was. But fathers who start in their 50s stand a good chance of
dying before their kids are 20. You may not like that idea, but it
is true. It leaves a tremendous void.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry says the conversation shook him to the core.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was I irresponsible in having a child so late in life?'' he
worries. ``Do children who have older parents and lose them
prematurely suffer a harm that makes the whole enterprise pure
self-gratification? I realized that in the decision around this
child, neither my wife or I had given much thought to whether I
would be alive at 75 or what I would be like in my 60s as our then
teenager confronted puberty and high school. Our main concerns had
been around our own lifestyle and how it would have to change.''
</P>
<P>
   But as he thought about it further, Larry realized that having a
father at age 50 or even 35 as a normal turn of events is a recent
phenomenon. His own father was 33 when Larry's grandfather died a
``normal'' death at 62, and this grandfather was 34 when his father
died in 1912.
</P>
<P>
   Today, if a man reaches 50, he will, on average, live past 80.
True, there is still a good chance that, if he is an older father,
his child will lose him in his or her 20s, at a time when many
children are still emotionally and financially dependent on their
fathers. But there is an even better chance that the father will be
there for the child's wedding and the grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Larry also contemplated the quality of the relationship with his
young child. Older parents know that they risk making their
children face a father's ``early'' death. Yet they also know that
they can give their child a higher material standard of living,
more father time, perhaps a higher quality of the father's time and
probably a more stable marital relationship during the years the
father is present.
</P>
<P>
   When we ask Larry about this conundrum, he is still not sure
what the right answer is. But he does feel that he has probably
spent a lot more time thinking about parenting than younger parents
do _ certainly more than when he had fathered his first child at
the age of 27.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Larry seems to have settled, at least in his own mind,
that he is doing the right thing.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Before I leave work, I call my wife to ask what our 5-year-old
son, Will, has been up to,'' says Michael Johnson, a general
manager at a printing company in Portland, Maine. ``Then when I
come home, I can tap right into Will's world. I'll say, `I hear you
were running around with an eye patch playing pirate today.' It
lets him know I have been thinking of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Johnson, more fathers today are making a connection between
their work life and their family life. Nearly 70 percent of working
men say that family is just as important as their job, or more
important, according to a national Roper Organization survey. As a
result, many working dads are struggling to find the balance that
was once thought to be only a mother's problem.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, 46 percent of fathers today say they don't spend enough
``quality time'' with their children. And when they're unable to do
this, 78 percent of men say they feel guilty, according to a survey
of nearly 350 parents conducted at Ohio's University of Toledo.
</P>
<P>
   So in these times, it's no longer enough to simply ask whether a
working mother hurts her kids by being away from them most of the
day. We now also need to address the brand-new question: What are
the consequences for families _ and businesses _ when fathers work?
</P>
<P>
   For years, it's been a fact of life that dads' jobs typically
take them away from their children for more than eight hours a day.
It's been through their work, through being good economic
providers, that fathers have established their very identities and
taken care of their families.
</P>
<P>
   So it never occurred to families or employers that business
should do anything _ aside from providing a paycheck _ to support
men as fathers. After all, why would it matter? Weren't work and
family separate worlds?
</P>
<P>
   The answer seems to be a resounding no. Over the past two
decades, a new wave of research on child and family development,
which had previously focused nearly exclusively on mothers, has
begun to document the vital role that fathers play in their
children's lives. This has led to a revolutionary understanding of
working dads: A man's dual roles as father and worker have an
enormous impact on each other.
 &UR; HOW WORK AFFECTS FAMILY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are the unseen stakeholders in the American workplace,''
says Stewart Friedman, director of the Wharton Life Interests
Project at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.
``Fathers' work is an unseen and underappreciated influence on
children's development.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are some surprising ways that a father's work has impact,
positive or negative, on his kids.
</P>
<P>
   + When fathers are satisfied with their jobs, their children
have fewer problems.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman and Jeffrey Greenhaus, professor of management at
Drexel University in Philadelphia, found that children ages 4 to 17
whose fathers say they are satisfied with their work exhibit fewer
behavioral problems such as shyness, withdrawal and aggressiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a dad is able to sit at the dinner table and talk about
his work with a positive attitude, confidence and pride, that seems
to rub off on his kids,'' Friedman says.
</P>
<P>
   + Too many or too few work hours affect children's learning and
development.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of 3-to-6-year-old children undertaken at Ohio State
University in Columbus, sociologists Toby Parcel and Elizabeth
Menaghan, the authors of ``Parents' Jobs and Children's Lives''
(Aldine De Gruyter, 1994), found that a father's unemployment may
be linked to increased behavior problems such as whining, hitting
and acting out. Conversely, working sustained overtime _ not just
putting in occasional long hours _ may also have a negative effect
on children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often, vocabulary will not be as developed,'' Parcel observes.
</P>
<P>
   When Dad is around, on the other hand, there are big benefits
for kids, numerous studies show. For example, at 6 months of age,
babies with actively involved fathers score higher on an
intellectual ability test, according to a study by F.A. Pederson,
author of the ``The Father-Infant Relationship'' (Praeger, 1980).
</P>
<P>
   And for girls, feeling competent in math is linked to a close
and warm relationship with their fathers, according to studies at
the University of Michigan School of Social Work in Ann Arbor.
</P>
<P>
   + How a boss treats a father can affect how a father treats his
kids.
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis-based art director Jeff Lovell, who has custody of
his three children, often has to come in late to work for family
reasons. Fortunately, he has a supportive boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not be able to stay with the company,'' Lovell says,
``if they didn't trust that I'll always get the work done.''
</P>
<P>
   And that kind of autonomy on the job leads to higher self-esteem
for a dad, according to researcher Karen Grimm-Thomas of
Pennsylvania State University in University Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's likely that when parents see themselves succeed at work,
they feel more confident as parents,'' she says. ``And they are
clearer about what they expect from their children, too.''
 &UR; HOW FAMILY AFFECTS WORK &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Do businesses value a man for being a good dad _ and show it in
their policies?
</P>
<P>
   Not as often as dads would like. Flextime is rarely an option.
Paternity leave is rarely paid. And since men typically continue to
earn more than women, it is usually not financially feasible for a
father to take an unpaid leave even if a company offers it.
</P>
<P>
   But good managers are at least beginning to recognize the
interdependence of work and family.
</P>
<P>
   At Corning Inc. in Corning, N.Y., manager Ed O'Brien lets his
employees define their own schedules. And he values the expertise
good parents bring with them to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Empathy, listening skills, knowing how to teach others and how
learning takes place _ all of these child-rearing practices are
directly applicable to the workplace,'' O'Brien says.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a father who just returned to his job as a purchasing
agent after taking paternity leave says that caring for his
4-month-old has given him a whole new way of listening to people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look more closely for nonverbal signals now,'' he says,
``and I can use this skill when I'm talking with colleagues and
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   When a company is sensitive to a father's family
responsibilities, dads want to keep working there. Mike Dedek, a
software engineer and father of three who works at Lexis-Nexis in
Miamisburg, Ohio, says, ``My dedication to this company is
primarily due to their family friendliness.''
</P>
<P>
   When a company's policies and programs take family needs into
account, employees are 45 percent more likely to ``go the extra
mile'' for their employer, say researchers at Dupont in Wilmington,
Del.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do these kinds of programs increase worker dedication,
but, as consultant Richard Federico of William Mercer Inc. in New
York observes, ``When people are less stressed out, they tend to
produce better on the job.''
 &UR; ACHIEVING A BETTER BALANCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How can you ease your own work-and-family juggling act,
especially when you may not have the most enlightened of bosses?
Here are some strategies.
</P>
<P>
   + Ask, don't assume.
</P>
<P>
   Think your bosses will never allow any adjustment in work
schedule, or that they'd interpret a family obligation as a lack of
commitment to the job? If so, you might actually cheat yourself of
what you need.
</P>
<P>
   One father was hesitant to ask his supervisor if he could stay
home with his son, who wasn't feeling well, so his wife took time
off from her own job. The next day his boss _ a working parent
herself _ happened to ask how things were going at home. When he
mentioned that his wife was at home with their sick child, the boss
said, ``Why don't you do your work at home if you need to?''
</P>
<P>
   The moral of the story: If you don't ask for what you need, you
won't get it.
</P>
<P>
   + Frame your request in terms of work.
</P>
<P>
   Your boss doesn't have to hear every detail of a family problem.
He or she just needs to be convinced that, in an emergency, you
have a plan for getting your work done, such as doing it at home or
having a colleague cover for you.
</P>
<P>
   + Use your human resources department.
</P>
<P>
   HR professionals today often receive special training in helping
employees negotiate sticky work/family issues. So, again, ask for
help.
</P>
<P>
   + Turn down extra work with business savvy.
</P>
<P>
   As downsizing leads to bigger workloads, it's increasingly
important to know how to turn down work that might compromise your
family's needs.
</P>
<P>
   One way is to present your boss with options for reprioritizing
your work: ``I'll be able to take on this assignment if I give up
some other stuff on my plate. Can we review my assignments and see
what I might delay doing, or perhaps delegate to someone else?''
</P>
<P>
   + Find strength in numbers.
</P>
<P>
   If you're having work/family problems, it's likely that your
fellow employees are, too. Chris Colbern, who supervises payroll
services at Cigna, a Philadelphia-based insurance company, gathered
a group of co-workers together to look at how other companies had
implemented flextime. The result: a new Cigna scheduling system
that virtually all employees prefer.
</P>
<P>
   It may not yet be the law of the land, but a member of the
nation's highest court is recognizing dads' family needs. In 1994,
shortly after her appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court, Justice
Ruth Bader Ginsburg was asked why she agreed to a flexible schedule
for law clerk David Post, who was attending Georgetown University
at night. His wife, an economist, had a demanding job, so Post
needed to care for their children during part of each day.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my dream of the way the world should be,'' Ginsburg
said. ``I was so pleased to see that there are indeed men who are
doing a parent's work, who do not regard that as strange.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like David, I hope, will be role models for other men
who may be fearful they won't succeed in their profession if they
spend time caring for their children or are concerned they will be
thought of as less than a man if family is of prime importance.''

GETTING RUSSIANS TO PAY TAXES IS NO EASY TASK
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ A tough new gang has hit the streets of Moscow and
other Russian cities in search of anyone foolish enough to keep
loose cash or goods where the gang can find them.
</P>
<P>
   Commandos wearing black ski masks and full combat gear raid
street vendors and small businesses. They confiscate property first
and ask questions later.
</P>
<P>
   Their leader, a man so blunt that his friends once dubbed him
the Bulldozer, has vowed to take on Russia's richest companies and
has reportedly drawn up a hit list of the nation's 1,000 wealthiest
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   This is no crime syndicate on the rampage. This is Russia's tax
collection agency and its tough new chief, Boris Fyodorov, who has
vowed to end Russia's chronic, crippling tax shortfall by forcing
the rich to pay their share and making law-abiding taxpayers out of
rank-and-file Russians.
</P>
<P>
   It is a monumental task in a land where most people view tax
evasion as their birthright. Only 3.2 million tax declarations were
submitted last year from a population of 150 million, Fyodorov told
reporters Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, the government has been pretending to collect
taxes, and people have been pretending to pay them,'' he quipped.
``We have to change this strange habit.''
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high. Russia annually fails to collect billions
of dollars in taxes, forcing the Kremlin to borrow heavily on
foreign and domestic markets. More than a third of Russia's budget
is spent servicing this debt. This in turn puts added pressure on a
state already unable to pay teachers, doctors, miners, and
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   President Boris N. Yeltsin partially blamed the tax shortfall
for a recent crisis of confidence among investors that threatened
the ruble and forced the government to briefly triple key interest
rates to 150 percent last week. While markets here have stabilized,
allowing the government to bring rates down to 60 percent this
week, improving tax collection is one of the priorities most often
mentioned by international lenders, including the International
Monetary Fund, which has held up payments to Russia over the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Fyodorov, 40, whose iron-fisted monetary policies were
credited with halting inflation and stabilizing the ruble while he
was finance minister in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   However, his critics charge that Fyodorov failed to pay the
government's bills, triggering a debt crisis that cripples Russia
to this day.
</P>
<P>
   A commentator from NTV television called him ``the mad dog of
Russian finance.'' Itogi magazine quoted a Russian government
official as calling him ``rude, impudent, and ill-willed'' _ and
therefore perfect for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Since Yeltsin appointed him last week, Fyodorov has threatened
the 51,000 Russian companies that are estimated to owe a combined
$150 billion in back taxes with confiscation of assets if they do
not pay up. He has promised to create a database of the 10,000
richest politicians, bankers, entertainers, and other prominent
citizens and track down and imprison tax evaders.
</P>
<P>
   But first, Fyodorov said Tuesday, he has to purge the tax
inspectorate of corrupt officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of my deputies are leaving today; some will leave
tomorrow,'' Fyodorov said. ``There is corruption. I have to deal
with it, although I would prefer not to.''
</P>
<P>
   His announcement followed the detention of Yuri Yurkov, the head
of Russia's State Statistics Committee, and several other senior
officals on suspicion of distorting information about major
companies to help them avoid paying taxes. Investigators seized
more than $1.5 million in cash _ $1 million of it during a search
at Yurkov's apartment that was shown on Russian television.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests could have far-reaching economic implications if it
turns out that there has been manipulation of the data that
government officials rely on to make policy and collect taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Fyodorov has talked so tough that he has been forced to back off
a statement he made to a Russian newspaper last week that he was
drawing up a hit list of celebrities who would be squeezed for tax
payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a person says he is a multi-millionaire on television but
does not pay taxes, we have to make him pay,'' Fyodorov said in a
television interview Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The question remains whether Russians will be coerced into
paying more taxes by the tough new approach. Most people here still
view the state as they did in the Soviet era _ as an intrusive,
thieving entity that is best outwitted or ignored. Anyone who
openly declares his income to tax authorities is considered a fool.
</P>
<P>
   It's not uncommon at cocktail parties to overhear Russian
businessmen chatting about new ways to avoid taxes. Russia's huge
and rarely audited collection of fly-by-night commercial banks,
off-shore corporations, and false-front companies make it easy for
citizens and businesses to hide what they own.
</P>
<P>
   People who avoid taxes are seen as folk heroes. After Russian
cross-country skier Larisa Lazutina won three gold medals at the
Nagano Winter Olympics, the government announced that she would
have to pay 35 percent income taxes on her nearly $1 million prize
from the Russian Olympic Committee. The announcement so outraged
the public that the government backed down.
</P>
<P>
   And how are the tax police going to find Slava, whose
construction business only pays and accepts cash, who keeps his
money in offshore accounts and under several names, who spends next
to nothing, so as not to attract attention?
</P>
<P>
   ``It is almost as if the authorities, never tiring of new ways
to make people's lives difficult, have wished to visit a new plague
upon them,'' said Slava, who asked that his full name and company
name not be used, to avoid giving the tax authorities a way to find
him. ``First we lost all our savings to inflation, then our jobs,
and now they want us to pay tax. It's a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts believe the problem is not how much Russia
collects, but what it does with the money collected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia already collects plenty of taxes,'' said Rory
McFarquhar, an economist and tax specialist with the
Russian-European Center for Economic Policy. The problem, he says,
is that much of the money goes to regional governments that
squander it.
</P>
<P>
   But changing the way tax money is spent is a problem that
Yeltsin, who depends on the political support of regional
governors, would rather not face.
</P>
<P>
   Economists here say that what is needed is a reform of Russia's
outdated corporate tax laws that impose a dizzying number of levies
on businesses and make it impossible for honest companies to make a
profit. Fyodorov agrees and adds that he would like to lower
personal income tax rates. Currently, anyone who earns more than
$8,000 annually faces a 35 percent tax rate without any deductions.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin has promised to submit a new tax code to parliament this
year. But Yeltsin made that promise last year, too.

 &HT;    
 By JOE APPLEGATE  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It is 5 a.m. on Father's Day, and you have decisions to make. Do
you lie quietly and wait for your children to come tumbling in with
their annual offerings of gratitude and affection, their homemade
cards, fund-raiser tie clips and bad cologne?
 &HT;    Or do you sneak out for a quick nine holes before anyone's the
wiser?
 &HT;    You turn and in the dimness can just make out the sleeping face
of your wife. You ask yourself where in the world you would be
without her.
 &HT;    Myrtle Beach?
 &HT;    Naah! This is where you belong, you tell yourself angrily. You
dope! A wife and children, good health, a steady job _ be honest
with yourself, you sorry hacker, would you trade them for anything
on this planet? Would you?
 &HT;    You choke back a tear.
 &HT;    Yes! Tiger Woods' swing.
 &HT;    Again, wearily, you try to imagine playing golf for a living,
having a job where you don't have to answer a phone, phone in an
answer, estimate budget figures, figure budget estimates or budget
estimated figures while answering the phone.
 &HT;    You are not so naive as to think that professional golfers don't
hate their jobs sometimes. And yet, try as you might, you cannot
imagine Woods telling himself that if he can just finish the back
nine by 5 o'clock he might be able to wedge in a quick staff
meeting before dinner.
 &HT;    OK, dude, you tell yourself, that's enough for one morning, get
a grip. Back to reality _ and a good, sane reality it is. You've
got some blessings to count:
 &HT;    + A wife who accepts your form of folly and who gets her
exercise hauling heavy packages around shopping malls. You both
carry your own bags.
 &HT;    + Kids who can be induced to come and play golf with you _ even
if it is for a price. You control the bets, however, and every
penny you have to pay out is worth it. The expression on a kid's
little face when a 20-foot putt is worth 20 bucks is priceless.
 &HT;    + Your own good sense, when all is said and done, in knowing
when to go for the greens and when to lay back, as now, in bed.
 &HT;    There are those Sundays when a full round of golf is a natural,
healthy choice. Is there any better alternative to the stupor of
the Super Bowl than a bracing round of golf on a deserted course,
even a snowy one?
 &HT;    And then there are those Sundays when abandoning your family to
play golf is maybe just a little bit sick. Father's Day is one,
Mother's Day definitely another.
 &HT;    So today, of all days, it's best to be still and enjoy your
status as father. Maybe one day your kid, interviewed after winning
a tournament and a big check on Father's Day, will smile at the
camera, wave and shout, ``I love you, Dad!'' _ just the way Woods
did on Mother's Day, except, of course, that he said, ``I love you,
Mom!''
 &HT;    And just think how popping proud you'll be that Father's Day,
watching it all on your VCR after coming in from your
late-afternoon round.

 By TIM HERRERA  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Thanks to past Father's Days, I can go a month without washing
underwear and my necktie collection rivals the discount racks at
any department store. As the father of four children, I own
countless mugs, T-shirts and finger-paint artwork that read
``WORLD'S GREATEST DAD!''
 &HT;    I treasure every handcrafted present my three boys and one
daughter have ever made, because they made them for me. However, my
hopes may be too high for 1998.
 &HT;    ``What do you want for Father's Day this year?'' my boys asked.
 &HT;    Despite the countless strips of colored cloth that seem to mate
in my closet, I could always use another necktie. Coffee-shop
coupons beat scraping pennies off my dresser for a morning cup.
 &HT;    But this year, I want something radical: I want peace on
Father's Day.
 &HT;    I'm not talking about world peace _ although that would be nice,
too. I want tranquility within the four walls of our two-story
house.
 &HT;    I answered, ``What if you guys quit fighting on Father's Day?''
 &HT;    You see, a day rarely goes by in our house without ``He hit
me!'' followed by ``He hit me first!'' Then comes the witty
``Did-not-did-too!'' exchange.
 &HT;    I'm asking for a one-day truce, one that even NATO diplomats
would have trouble arranging. The treaty doesn't have to be in
writing _ I'll accept a verbal agreement, with or without
handshakes.
 &HT;    But I want an entire day without hearing ``Dork!'' ``Dog
breath!'' or something worse echoing through our house as the kids
battle for the Nintendo, the VCR or the remote control _ my remote
control.
 &HT;    My request puzzled them. Either they didn't understand or they
knew the mission was impossible. I could tell they were hunting for
an escape clause in an agreement they were reluctant to make.
 &HT;    ``Yeah, no fighting's good, Dad,'' they said. ``But how 'bout if
we go to the movies like we did last year? Maybe we can go see
`Godzilla?'''
 &HT;    ``What the heck,'' I said. ``Who needs peace and tranquility,
anyway?''
 &HT;    It seems we are forming a Father's Day tradition. Last year, we
also commemorated the day by watching loud, frightening and scaly
creatures engaging in noisy rampages. No, we weren't watching ``The
Jerry Springer Show'' or anything on C-Span _ we went to see ``The
Lost World.''
 &HT;    It was a memorable day, but not because of the film. It was
memorable because the outing was their idea.
 &HT;    I ended up taking our two older boys _ ages 8 and 10 _ to the
``Jurassic Park'' sequel. I felt the younger kids were too little
to watch dinosaurs devour screaming humans, even at matinee prices.
 &HT;    While driving to the theater with the boys, I started thinking
about my father and the only time I could ever remember just the
two of us going to the movies.
 &HT;    It was a cool, spring Pennsylvania day. Dad and I carried light
jackets as we walked to the old Memorial Theater, strolling along
the steep hills, past the Veterans Memorial and my school, St.
Joseph's Elementary.
 &HT;    Dad was barely 5-foot-4, but I was still much smaller and
struggled to keep up with his quick stride.
 &HT;    Sometimes I get angry because I can't recall everything about
that day. However, I am grateful for one image still floating in my
mind: I remember looking over, seeing the light from the movie
screen flickering on Dad's face and thinking how cool it was that
he was just spending time with me.
 &HT;    All the way home from the theater, I replayed the film for my
father. Since Dad laughed, I was positive he liked the Batman movie
as much as I did. But I never really found out _ I never thought to
ask.
 &HT;    Dad died about five years ago, and every third Sunday in June I
think of our day at the movies.
 &HT;    As my sons and I walked out of the theater after ``The Lost
World,'' our eyes adjusting to the sunlight glaring off the parking
lot, my middle son turned and asked: ``Dad, did you like the
movie?''
 &HT;    ``I sure did, pal.''
 &HT;    He'll never know how glad I am that he asked.
 &HT;    When we're coming out of the theater this year, maybe I'll catch
them in a weak moment and ask them to pick up the smelly sweat
socks they've scattered from the corner of the kitchen to the edge
of the driveway.
 &HT;    While we're at it, let's have an armpit-noise ceasefire _
especially at the dinner table and at church.
 &HT;    But perhaps I should just appreciate the time with them. The
time a child spends alone with his or her father is special. Too
often it's taken for granted by both parent and child.
 &HT;    Maybe peace at home on Father's Day is a bit much to ask. Maybe
all we need is another nice monster movie and some time together to
create some moments worth reliving.

 &UR; By JIM MCKAY &QL; 
 &UR; (Excerpted from ``The Real McKay: My Wide World of Sports'') &QL; 
(Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For more than 40 years, I have walked the fairways of the world
behind the game's greatest artists, playing in the most famous
championships on the planet's most storied courses.
</P>
<P>
   During that time, golf has exploded, both as a spectator and a
participant sport. Why?
</P>
<P>
   To me, it has principally been the result of the sterling
careers of certain players, and not Arnold Palmer alone. I'll be
audacious enough now to list my top 10 players, whose achievements
I have described on ABC and CBS during the past 40 years.
 &UR; The McKay Ratings &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Jack Nicklaus
</P>
<P>
   Twenty majors in all. Will anyone ever equal that?
</P>
<P>
   Tack on a total of 70 wins on the PGA Tour, two Walker Cup
teams, six Ryder Cup teams (twice captain), two U.S. Senior Open
titles and a Senior PGA. He intimidated his peers like no one since
Bobby Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus was not, however, without his crushing defeats or his
personal insecurities.
</P>
<P>
   His toughest loss came at Pebble Beach in the 1982 U.S. Open. At
the age of 42, he had finished his final round of the championship
and was standing beside the scorer's tent waiting to be interviewed
as the first player ever to win five U.S. Opens, if Tom Watson
bogied either of the last two holes. And Watson was in trouble, his
ball sitting in long grass behind the green of the par three 17th.
</P>
<P>
   From our tower at 18, I looked down on Nicklaus. He was staring
at a monitor showing Watson lining up his shot. From the difficult
lie, it might well run far across the green, leaving him a likely
bogie and setting up victory for Jack.
</P>
<P>
   But Watson made ``the shot heard round the world,'' knocking the
ball into the hole for a birdie. In that instant, as he stood just
below me, Jack's expression was not his usual ironic half-smile of
defeat, but a look of total shock and deep disappointment, the face
of a stricken youngster, not of the most famous golfer in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   2. Arnold Palmer
</P>
<P>
   To understand Arnold Palmer and his endless appeal to Everyman,
it helps to sit with him as I did at the home (in Latrobe, Pa.) he
and his wife, Winnie, have lived in for more than 35 years and
understand that he IS Everyman.
</P>
<P>
   He still loves to sit by the pool, looking down toward the
course he grew up on, just at the bottom of the hill. That day some
four or five years ago, he smiled and told me how he used to lie
outside his family's house on the edge of the course and wait for
the woman to come by the sixth hole--the woman who always gave him
a nickel if he would hit her ball over the water hazard for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see myself now when I was really small,'' he said.
``Making sure my dad couldn't see me because I wasn't allowed on
the course.''
</P>
<P>
   I once asked Arnold Palmer how he has kept such a hold on his
fans. He looked at me, a faint smile on his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim,'' he said, ``maybe it's because they understand who I am.
I think I am an honestly sensitive and sentimental person. Maybe
they sense that I care a great deal about what I do and that their
encouragement means a lot to me.''
</P>
<P>
   3. Lee Trevino
</P>
<P>
   My most vivid memory of Trevino in his heyday is at the 1972
British Open on the Muirfield links in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   It could have been the pro-am preceding the Quad Cities Open as
far as his attitude was concerned. He kept up a running
conversation, or more properly a monologue, with the Scottish
gallery all the way around.
</P>
<P>
   Standing on one tee, he turned to the crowd and said, ``They
took me to an old castle for dinner last night. We had food like
they ate back in the old days, and we ate like they did--with our
fingers. Heck, back home in Texas I even have a cat I taught to eat
with a fork!''
</P>
<P>
   Then he laughed and knocked his tee shot in his usual
left-to-right arc into the middle of the fairway.
</P>
<P>
   4. Tom Watson
</P>
<P>
   Of his remarkable five British Open victories, four of them were
won by a single shot, one in a playoff.
</P>
<P>
   If Nicklaus was the greatest and Palmer the most charismatic of
championship golfers, certainly Tom Watson, as he plays on in his
late 40s, still convinced that he will win another major, is the
most tenacious.
</P>
<P>
   5. Gary Player
</P>
<P>
   In July of 1954, at the age of 18, Gary Player stepped off a
train at a small town in Scotland, carrying a cardboard suitcase
held together with a piece of rope. Since that day, he has become
the world's most traveled athlete, flying around the globe year
after year, winning the national championships of the United
States, Great Britain, Australia, Chile, and Brazil, among others.
</P>
<P>
   His dedication to fitness and proper diet borders on the
fanatical, and some of his beliefs approach the mystical. In the
earlier days, he would usually dress totally in black. ``Why?'' he
was asked. ``It must be terribly hot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' he replied, ``but it makes me feel strong.''
</P>
<P>
   6. Greg Norman
</P>
<P>
   I feel uncomfortable not placing Greg Norman in my top bracket.
Today, he is probably the best-known golfer in the world, having
won 55 tournaments internationally, as well as 16 on the American
tour.
</P>
<P>
   But...
</P>
<P>
   Every great player has performances he would rather forget, but
Greg's have come in the spotlight of major championships and have
come in such dramatic fashion that they dominate his image, despite
all his achievements.
</P>
<P>
   7. Seve Ballesteros
</P>
<P>
   His emergence was sudden, his impact enormous, his downfall
unforeseen and shocking.
</P>
<P>
   What happened? No one knows, although some theorists blame
imperfections in his swing, others the explosive nature of his
character. But it seems to be over for Seve at age 40, unless he
can pull some middle-aged miracles as he creeps toward 50 and the
Senior Tour. His impact on the game remains, however.
</P>
<P>
   It was his play that forced expansion of the Ryder Cup matches
from the U.S. versus Great Britain and Ireland to the U.S. versus
all of Europe. As a result, the matches,have become an increasingly
competitive and major event.
</P>
<P>
   8. Nick Faldo
</P>
<P>
   He has not yet joined the pantheon of the game, partly because
of his rather phlegmatic personality and, in the minds of some
people, because of his reliance on a golfing guru named David
Leadbetter, who completely rebuilt Nick's swing and follows him
around the course and to the practice tee as if Faldo were still a
student, not a champion.
</P>
<P>
   At times, I have found myself thinking, Can you imagine Ben
Hogan being followed every step of his career by a coach?
</P>
<P>
   9. ay Floyd
</P>
<P>
   How's this for career longevity? He was only 18 when he turned
pro 35 years ago. Now, as he nears his mid-50s, he is still winning
on the Senior Tour and occasionally returning to the regular tour
to instruct his juniors by example on how to play the game with
skill and dignity.
</P>
<P>
   10. To round out my top 10, I'll have to resort to that old cop-
out, a tie. In this case, a three way tie, among Ben Crenshaw, Tom
Kite and Hale Irwin.
</P>
<P>
   Now what shall I do about Tiger Woods and Ernie Els?
</P>
<P>
   All three of the world's famous championships were won in '97 by
men in their 20s; Woods, 21, the Masters; Els, 27, the U.S. Open;
and Leonard, 25, the British Open. Might one of them be the new
Nicklaus or Palmer? Possibly.
</P>
<P>
   But as far as ranking any of them, I can only echo the comment
made long ago by Red Smith. After Willie Mays had turned in his
second great season in the majors, someone asked Red if he thought
Mays was as good as Joe DiMaggio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come back and ask me that in 20 years,'' he said, ``and I'll
tell you.''

LEAVING THE CAMERA OUT OF THE EQUATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June 14)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN FLINN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The sign a the Kenya-Tanzania border checkpoint said ``It is
strictly forbidden to photograph the Masai,'' but I was finding it
almost impossible to comply. As I pointed my lens at some distant
giraffes, taking care not to include any forbidden Masai in the
frame, a blurry figure maneuvered itself into the foreground.
</P>
<P>
   Adjusting the focus, I found my viewfinder filled with a lanky
young Masai warrior, striking a jaunty pose.
</P>
<P>
   I turned and aimed my camera at a herd of gazelles, but before I
could trip the shutter my new friend had repositioned himself in
front of my lens. He seemed about as camera-shy as a young starlet
at Cannes.
</P>
<P>
   I gestured for him to move, but he just stood there, staring
into the camera and flashing a winsome, semi-toothed grin. I put my
camera away, but the Masai, apparently thinking I'd taken his
picture, rushed forward, palm outstretched, saying, ``Shillings!
Shillings!''
</P>
<P>
   Few souvenirs are as irresistible to the traveler as a photo of
the locals in their colorful, native costumes. But these days I
almost always leave my camera in my backpack: photography has
ruined too many moments.
</P>
<P>
   Laws against photographing the Masai tribe in East Africa stem
from the tribe's traditional belief that cameras capture their
souls. While many Masai apparently still hold to this, many of the
ones who live in areas frequented by tourists have transformed
themselves into willing photo opportunities to raise some quick
cash.
</P>
<P>
   While I sympathize with their need or at least desire to do so,
I can't help feeling uneasy about the loss of dignity for one of
the region's proudest tribes. And I've seen too many encounters
between the Masai and Western tourists suddenly turn sour over
misunderstandings about photos and money. By leaving my camera out
of the equation, I've sometimes managed to have memorable
encounters with the Masai, rather than just quick cash-for-snapshot
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   The Masai really do wear distinctive red-plaid togas and carry
spears, but elsewhere in the world a depressing number of
photogenic locals don their colorful costumes as little more than
props for photographers. A few years ago, in Peru, some friends
watched a man in modern, European-style clothes stake out a scenic
spot on the shore of Lake Titicaca and then change into a bright,
multihued pancho and a pointy, ear-covering cap _ becoming, as my
friends called him, an ``instant Inca'' for the benefit of
camera-toting tourists.
</P>
<P>
   As with the Masai, he was obviously entitled to try to make some
money from tourism, but I feel bad about encouraging people to
transform themselves into the equivalent of the guy who dresses up
as Mickey Mouse at Disneyland.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps my reticence comes from once having been on the other
side of the lens. Many years ago, when I was starting out as a
mountain climber, I made a pilgrimage to the birthplace of the
sport began _ Chamonix, in the French Alps.
</P>
<P>
   On my first morning I was dressed the way the famous French
alpinist Gaston Rebuffat always was in his books: in knickers, a
thick woolen sweater and some cool bug-eyed goggles I'd picked up
in a souvenir shop.
</P>
<P>
   To my horror I quickly discovered that no self-respecting French
climber has dressed this way since about 1952, when my Gaston
Rebuffat books were published. The local alpinists wore loud,
multicolored Gore-Tex parkas and the latest Vuarnet sunglasses.
Among them I looked, frankly, like a doofus.
</P>
<P>
   Before I could slink off to change my outfit a bus pulled up and
three dozen Japanese tourists bounded off, each sporting an
expensive camera and a souvenir-shop felt alpine hat about as
outdated as my clothes. Apparently they read the same Gaston
Rebuffat books. Their leader said something and gestured in my
direction, and instantly 36 lenses were trained on me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wait!'' I tried to say. ``You don't want me, you want a
picture of one of these other guys. They're the real climbers.''
</P>
<P>
   It was no use. Soon they were posing with me, first two or three
at a time, then the entire group. They ignored the real climbers,
who apparently didn't fit their notion of what an alpinist should
look like _ and who no doubt had better things to do than hold
still for tourist pictures.
</P>
<P>
   The shutters kept clicking, and my smile grew more strained with
each pose. I said I really had to get going, and I felt a hand
press down gently but firmly on my shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Japanese seemed to speak English, but none of them
made any effort to talk to me, to find out anything about me. They
just wanted their photo of the native in his colorful local
costume, and when they were finished they would get back on their
tour bus and move on.
</P>
<P>
   At that point I would have gladly posted a sign saying, ``It is
strictly forbidden to photograph the dorky looking climber.''

FOR-PROFIT MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM HAS ITS CRITICS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Twice since February, Mel Urban's 30-year-old son has been
denied hospital admission for treatment of psychosis, and he puts
the blame on the state's for-profit mental health managed care
contractor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the worst I've ever seen him,'' said Urban of his son,
who was diagnosed 11 years ago with bipolar disorder, a mental
illness characterized by periods of mania and of depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just feels very depressed. Where he's headed, I just don't
know,'' said Urban, adding that while his son was finally
hospitalized and released, he still has not gotten the treatment he
needs. ``Now he's angry, he's disturbed, agitated and confused,
because the system has jerked him around so much.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference at 1 p.m. at the Statehouse Wednesday,
Urban and other critics of mental health services will challenge
the state's $200-million-a-year contract with the Massachusetts
Behavioral Health Partnership to provide services to 400,000
mentally ill adults and children.
</P>
<P>
   The privatization of mental health services once provided by the
state is leading to denial of needed care, inappropriately short
hospital stays and overreliance on medication, the critics charged,
while the for-profit company makes its profits.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the state and the Partnership have been slow
to respond to requests for information vital to monitoring care,
the critics said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that (monitoring information) hasn't been produced
sets off real alarm bells for me,'' said Susan Fendell, senior
attorney for the Mental Health Legal Advisors Committee, who has
long been requesting information from the state Division of Medical
Assistance (DMA), which administers the contract with the
Partnership &UR; .  &LR; Only last week Fendell got year-old information that
still needs to be analyzed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either DMA is not doing its job properly in monitoring the
program, or they're withholding the information that the public
should have,'' said Fendell, who will be among those at the news
conference. The legal advisors committee, an arm of the Supreme
Judicial Court, is also part of the DMA's behavioral health program
advisory council.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Fendell and Urban, others planning to speak at
the news conference include Barbara Rhuda of the Alliance for the
Mentally Ill, clinical psychologist Paul K. Ling, psychiatric nurse
Patricia Hayward and former state senator and current Democratic
gubernatorial candidate Patricia McGovern.
</P>
<P>
   But state and Partnership officials say that they have responded
in a timely fashion to requests for information, and that the
quality of care has been maintained.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard of no complaints,'' said John Widdison, spokesman
for the Department of Mental Health, which used to provide the
services that the Partnership now does.
</P>
<P>
   While Widdison said he could not comment directly on the
Partnership contract, since DMA, also known as Medicaid,
administers it, he added, ``We hold Medicaid accountable and
Medicaid holds the Partnership accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Sheola, chief executive officer for the Partnership,
said DMA has been so satisfied with the services that it has agreed
to extend the Partnership's three-year contract an additional year,
through 2000. In addition, DMA has just awarded the Partnership a
two-year, $3.4 million contract to administer another state
program, the primary care clinician network management service for
Medicaid patients, Sheola said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does suggest a high level of confidence that the (DMA)
commissioner has in us,'' Sheola said. In addition, he pointed to
several other organizations that have supported the Partnership's
work, including Mental Health Corporations of Massachusetts Inc.,
which represents providers, such as community mental health
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   While critics such as Mel Urban have charged the Partnership
with denying patients necessary care to make money, Sheola said the
contract is structured in such a way as to discourage that from
happening.
</P>
<P>
   Sheola said patient confidentiality prevented him from
commenting on the Urban case, but he added that under Partnership
policy, rarely, if ever, are patients denied hospital admission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our general policy is our members get access to the highest
quality care as quickly as possible,'' Sheola said. ``We have an
obligation and a commitment to provide access to the least
restrictive, most clinically appropriate care that's available.''

A LOVE STORY OF GLOBE-SPANNING, BLINDNESS AND LONG ABSENCE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHANIE EBBERT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The memories endured over the years: There was a Christmas
party, an ice cream date, a trip to his senior prom. She was the
girl with the beautiful singing voice who won all the solos in
choir.
</P>
<P>
   The details dissipated with time, but some facts remained
indelible _ that Anjali Henry was the girl to whom John Gallagher
had once given a friendship ring, who had so sweetly, so naively
told their friends that they were engaged. That they had grown
apart, as people do, after he graduated from the Perkins School for
the Blind in 1982. That the same year, she had returned home to
India and he had begun growing up and realizing what he had already
lost.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen years after they last spoke, John had no means to find
Anjali, except an outdated address and a nagging desire to learn
what had happened to her.
</P>
<P>
   He composed his first letter in 1988, dictating the words to a
volunteer writer, saying that he'd been a fool to lose her. No
reply came. Undaunted, he wrote letter after letter, year after
year, lightly touching on the subject that wore on his heart more
and more: Why didn't she respond?
</P>
<P>
   Eight years later, he received his first reply.
</P>
<P>
   This is how John Gallagher found Anjali Henry, the one who got
away.
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher, 37, is not shy, not easily intimidated. Though
legally blind _ he can see bright colors and silhouettes _ the
Belmont native set off across country to attend college in
California. Though his balance is hindered by Friedreich's atoxia,
a nerve disorder that causes his hands to shake, makes him stagger,
and sometimes sends him to a wheelchair, he set out for the Florida
Keys nine years ago to swim with dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy just kind of does whatever he wants,'' said his
sister, Deborah Poirier, of Sudbury. ``He does things most sighted
people wouldn't do.''
</P>
<P>
   So it was typical of John _ a man twice elected to Belmont Town
Meeting, who sued the town for failure to better accommodate the
handicapped _ to hang on with pit bull persistence in trying to
locate Anjali.
</P>
<P>
   When he first began sending her letters he used an old address
she'd given him before he graduated. He wrote two or three times a
year over the next eight years, until someone in India took pity on
him and wrote to let him know his letters had fallen victim to a
changed district and zip code.
</P>
<P>
   With childlike optimism, he wrote again to the correct address,
to a girl now grown, graduated, accomplished, and quite surprised
to hear from him. ``I couldn't figure out why, after all those
years, this person was interested in me halfway around the world,''
Anjali said.
</P>
<P>
   Anjali, 33, who is completely blind, had left the Perkins campus
in Watertown in 1982, returning to India to finish high school,
college, and earn a master's degree in medical and
psychiatric &UR;  &LR; social work. She went on to open a psychiatric wing at
Christian Hospital &UR;  &LR; _ where her parents are administrators _ in the
state of Orissa, and thought little about the young man she had
dated for just five months before she left.
</P>
<P>
   When a letter from John first reached her in April 1996, she
considered it a curiosity from an old friend. She didn't answer
until a second one came. But as they began writing regularly, their
words grew more familiar, more intense.
</P>
<P>
   She still remembers the time _ 11:30 a.m. on Sept. 5, 1996 _
when she received an unforgettable letter. ``After 14 years, I know
I still love you,'' John wrote, a message that left her stunned.
``My cousin was with me and read it to me, and I remember saying to
her, `How can he say that? I mean, he hasn't seen me in 14 years,'
'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   John said he carried her in his heart all those years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never let the memory die and always have that glimmer of
hope,'' he said. ``That's what love is _ it never dies.''
</P>
<P>
   Letters were no longer enough for them after that moment. They
began talking on the phone as often as possible, and, when John
suggested a trip to India, Anjali asked him to hurry. ``I just
wanted to know what his intentions were,'' she said. ``And everyone
told me, don't hope too much. It may end up to be nothing.'' So
John began making plans, despite his family's fears for his safety
on a six-week trip to an unfamiliar land.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just couldn't believe he was going to undertake this, with
his handicap, and with the people that are in India and how lax
they are with handicapped (accessibility),'' said his father,
Bernard Gallagher of Belmont. ``But John does what he's going to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   So in December 1996, after three months of intense
correspondence and regular phone calls, John boarded a plane for a
21-hour flight to India &UR;  &LR; _ from Logan International Airport to
Frankfurt, Germany, where he had a seven-hour layover until the
flight to Delhi. He had arranged for assistance at the airports.
</P>
<P>
   But his nervousness was magnified by his expensive cargo _ an
engagement ring in his pants pocket. Before he left, he had
scheduled a trip to a jeweler, who described the stones and offered
him ring after ring to feel and choose.
</P>
<P>
   He kept it in his pocket the entire trip. ``I was scared to
death,'' he said. ``I never let it out of my sight.''
</P>
<P>
   When he finally had a chance to see her silhouette, she was just
as he remembered. ``It's almost like a light went on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she was guarded, quiet, wary of his purpose, as her
family members welcomed him with garland. It was the coming weeks,
filled with laughter and remembering, that made her know.
</P>
<P>
   Days later, just after midnight, New Year's Day 1997, John led
Anjali into the hallway of her aunt's home and asked her to marry
him. Years after she'd eagerly accepted his friendship ring, Anjali
was oblivious when he handed her a box.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `What's this?' '' she said. ``He said, `A ring.' I
said, `What for?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Her family was floored. They urged the couple to take more time
to get to know one another. So Anjali and John held off their
formal engagement _ until Jan. 28. ``I guess I just realized he was
the one for me,'' Anjali said.
</P>
<P>
   They postponed plans for the wedding _ enduring another 10
months of separation, phone calls and letters _ until Anjali could
come to America in December. She had to leave her job, and is
trying to find comparable work here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here she had a fabulous job in India and she took a chance,''
said Roz Rowley, a Perkins teacher who taught Anjali and has
resumed a friendship with her. ``Not many people would do that,
come all the way around a part of the world to see if a
relationship would actually work.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many reasons for her to be frightened, but Anjali is
certain of her decision based on one concept: Faith.
</P>
<P>
   On June 20, before 108 witnesses in the First Congregational
Church in Cambridge, Anjali Henry and John Gallagher plan to begin
a life together, once again.

CLEAN AIR NEEDED FOR THIS COURTHOUSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EILEEN McNAMARA 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three years is a long time to ask anyone to hold his breath, but
that's exactly what the Commonwealth of Massachusetts expects of
employees at Malden District Court.
</P>
<P>
   Clerks and probation officers, court officers and secretaries
have been pleading with Presiding Justice Paul C. Cavanaugh since
1995 to have the air quality of the century-old brick courthouse
tested for contaminants.
</P>
<P>
   In two of the last three years, employees have submitted
petitions to Cavanaugh and his supervisors, alerting them to the
persistent respiratory problems and other ailments plaguing the
staff. According to the employees' survey, more than half of them
experience burning eyes, headaches, nosebleeds, and breathing
problems. None report suffering those symptoms before their
employment at Malden District Court. All suspect indoor pollution
as the cause.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-seven employees signed the most recent memo this spring,
urging ``that air quality testing be performed immediately and that
the results be shared with all employees of Malden District Court.
If air quality problems are identified, we further request that
permanent structural changes be made to the building to correct the
problem rather than a repetition of the inadequate stop-gap
measures taken to date.''
</P>
<P>
   When the judge and administrative offices of the Trial Court
again turned a deaf ear, the employees spent $1,000 of their own
money to hire ATC Associates of Woburn to analyze two ceiling tiles
spirited out of the building.
</P>
<P>
   The results surprised no one.
</P>
<P>
   The ceiling samples contained visible microbiological growth.
The bacteria and fungal spores identified by air quality engineers
included Stachybotrys chartarum, a toxic mold that is known to
cause headaches, skin rashes, fatigue, nausea, nosebleeds, and
respiratory illness, and is a suspected carcinogen.
</P>
<P>
   When Stachybotrys chartarum in much smaller amounts was found on
the ceilings and in the heating ducts at Haverhill District Court
three years ago, the building was closed for eight months until the
sources of water entry and condensation were identified and
eliminated, the contaminated material removed, and the courthouse
thoroughly disinfected.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, individual ceiling tiles conspicuously stained
green, yellow, and brown from the toxic mold at Malden District
Court have merely been replaced, and the source of the
contamination left unaddressed.
</P>
<P>
   To compound matters, employees at the courthouse say they worry
that too much agitation about working conditions could cost them
their jobs. Cavanaugh is said to take a dim view of employee
activism. In his five years as presiding judge he has replaced
clerks with friends from Medford: two waitresses from his favorite
restaurants and his longtime travel agent.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Cavanaugh has been unavailable to talk about air quality
at the courthouse. He is vacationing in Paris, a trip court
employees say was booked from the law library telephone by his
administrative assistant/travel agent.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, patronage is endemic in the lower courts. Cavanaugh,
a former state legislator and Middlesex registrar of probate,
apparently runs his court in the time-honored tradition of many
political appointees. But even in Massachusetts, intimidation is
frowned upon in the judiciary. Last September Cavanaugh reportedly
removed his robe while on the bench, rolled it into a ball, and
threw it at his session clerk after she pointed out a procedural
oversight. She also happens to be one of those employees pressing
for an air quality review. A colleague who witnessed the outburst
filed a complaint with the Judicial Conduct Commission, which has
yet to rule on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   After the shop steward read the air quality report, the union
filed a class action grievance last month, accusing the
commonwealth of violating the health and safety provisions of the
contract. Even Judge Roanne Sragow, the regional administrative
judge, forwarded a copy of the staff-financed report to Michael
Jordan, director of capital projects for the Trial Court.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has not responded. He may be waiting to see if the
Legislature plans to release the long-delayed $345 million bond
bill to make critical repairs to many of the state's crumbling
courthouses, including the one in Malden.
</P>
<P>
   While court administrators and Beacon Hill lawmakers delay,
employees of Malden District Court begin a fourth year holding
their breath.

GETTING A TASTE OF ITALY, WITH SWISS EFFICIENCY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June 14)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN FLINN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUGANO, Switzerland _ Slurping the last of the foam from my
cappuccino, I begin the long process of trying to signal the waiter
for the bill and take one final look around sun-splashed Piazza
della Riforma.
</P>
<P>
   It's a balmy May morning, and the scent of jasmine is in the
air. Palm trees shade a nearby avenue buzzing with Alfa Romeos and
Vespa motor scooters. At cafes around the cobbled piazza, men and
women in up-to-the-minute Milan fashions are greeting each other
with kisses and hearty buon giornos.
</P>
<P>
   Finally catching the waiter's eye, I check my watch and realize
I'd better hurry to the ``stazione.'' There is no chance of my
train being late because this is, after all, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes called the Swiss Riviera _ two words one normally
doesn't associate with each other _ the canton of Ticino has been
enchanting and disorienting visitors for centuries. It's a slice of
the Italian Lakes region that, due to 15th-century geopolitics,
happens to be within the political boundaries of Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Separated from the rest of the country by the snow-capped Alps,
it's a region that blends two vastly different cultures: its
language, food, religion, architecture and fashions are Italian,
but Ticino someone makes it all operate with Swiss efficiency,
tidiness and spot-on punctuality.
</P>
<P>
   It's a land with a sun-baked Mediterranean climate, where
vineyards climb steep hillsides and villas with red-tile roofs line
the shores of vast, fiord-like lakes. In craggy valleys reaching
deep into the Alps' southern ramparts, walking paths cross arched,
Roman-style stone bridges and meander past trailside shrines to the
Madonna.
</P>
<P>
   Shaped like an arrowhead pointing toward the Mediterranean,
Ticino once belonged to the Lombardy region of Italy, being wrested
back and forth between Milan and Como until the late 1400s. In
1478, while Lombardy was distracted by internal warfare, the Swiss
began annexing the southern approaches to the strategic and
lucrative St. Gotthard Pass over the Alps. Thirty-five years later,
all of Ticino was in Swiss hands.
</P>
<P>
   I wondered if having a southern European culture and a northern
European government would cause strife, but this particular brand
of diversity seems to sit well with Ticinans.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our heart we're more Italian than Swiss, but I think
everybody here is happy to be Swiss,'' said Marilyn Crivelli, a
lifelong Lugano resident who was showing us around town. ``Nothing
against Italy, but here in Switzerland our government works and our
money is stable.''
</P>
<P>
   For exploring Ticino, my wife, Jeri, and I chose as our bases
two towns with confoundingly similar names _ Lugano and Locarno _
and similar locations: each sits on the northwest corner of a
large, finger-like lake that straddles the Swiss-Italian border.
</P>
<P>
   Lugano is the smaller and more prosperous of the two, and claims
to have the greatest concentration of banks in Europe, possibly the
world: There is one financial institution here for every 300
residents. One morning, when I couldn't get my card to work in the
ATM at a Credit Suisse branch, I walked 20 steps across the piazza
to the next bank _ another Credit Suisse branch.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the Renaissance, the only ones who could afford to hire
the great architects of the day were the churches,'' Crivelli said.
``Today it's the banks.''
</P>
<P>
   All that wealth finds an outlet on Via Nassa, the Fifth Avenue
of Lugano. It's a cobbled, pedestrian-only street lined with the
glittering nameplates of Versace, Gucci, Rolex and Patek Phillipe.
Price tags in the windows range from expensive to
surely-you-must-be-joking. If you're looking to spend the price of
a used Volvo on a wristwatch, you'll have no trouble doing it here.
</P>
<P>
   At the south end of Via Nassa, near the shore of Lago di Lugano,
we came to the scaffolded, gutted facade of the once-grand,
once-palatial Grand Hotel Palace, a remnant of the days when Lugano
was a sun-dappled playground for the crowned heads of Europe. Queen
Victoria stayed there, as did Czar Nicholas II.
</P>
<P>
   Lugano still regularly lures a few present or past heads of
state, including King Faisal of Saudi Arabia and, I'm told, George
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Next door to the hotel is the surprising Santa Maria degli
Angioli church. It doesn't look particularly noteworthy from the
outside, and I'd already passed it several times without going in.
But when Crivelli pushed open the thick oak doors, I was stunned: A
massive arch between the nave and the choir was covered by a
remarkable fresco of the Passion and Crucifixion painted in 1529 by
Bernardino Luini, a pupil of Leonardo da Vinci.
</P>
<P>
   The lower reaches of the fresco were partially erased. Crivelli
explained it happened when the walls were scrubbed after the church
was used as a hospital during an outbreak of plague in the 1700s.
On one unscathed wall of the church is Luini's version of the Last
Supper, with his teacher da Vinci sitting in for one of the
disciples; in a little chapel off the nave hangs a depiction of the
Madonna believed to have been painted by Leonardo himself.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE ... MORE)
</P>
<P>
   Afterward we went for a walk through the tidy civic gardens
along the shore of Lago di Lugano. Beneath palm trees, magnolias
and mimosas were in bloom. Couples strolled with paper cups of
gelato and swans glided through the lake. I checked the newspaper
and found that elsewhere in Switzerland _ on the other side of the
Alps _ it was cool and drizzly. It was hard not to feel smug.
</P>
<P>
   If we needed a reminder we were in Switzerland, we got it the
next day when we checked the train schedule for our short trip to
Locarno. Our train was scheduled to arrive in Bellizona at 10:03
a.m., while the connecting train to Locarno pulled out at 10:07
a.m. It's hard to think of another country that would purposely
schedule connections that closely. But our trains hit their marks
precisely, and we made the Locarno train with plenty of time _
well, 30 seconds _ to spare.
</P>
<P>
   Locarno, you might recall, is the town Hemingway's character
rowed through the night to reach at the end of ``A Farewell to
Arms.'' It's located on the shore of Lago Maggiore, most of which
lies in Italy. At only 672 feet above sea level, Locarno is the
lowest and warmest spot in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Like Lugano, it's sprinkled with cobbled piazzas and arcades
full of inviting outdoor cafes, all connected by narrow, winding
passageways. Lake steamers come and go, connecting Locarno with
Stresa and other Italian resorts along Lago Maggiore.
</P>
<P>
   A transportation hub, Locarno makes a great base for exploring
lakeside neighbors such as Ascona and the rustic mountain valleys
that radiate out from the lake like fingers in a glove.

</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon we boarded a lake steamer for the half-hour
journey to the Brissago Islands, famous for their vast, subtropical
botanical gardens.
</P>
<P>
   A retreat for the well-to-do since Roman times, the islands were
bought in 1885 by a Russian baroness who built a villa to house her
salon of artists and writers. She traveled the world collecting
exotic plants for her gardens, and cataloged the plants she
cultivated in a diary that was published in 1913 in London.
</P>
<P>
   When the baroness fell on hard times in 1927, she sold the
islands to a wealthy German businessman, who added a Roman bath,
which remains today. Forty years ago the properties passed to the
local government. Today a Swiss conservation and nature group
maintains them and opens them to the public between April and
mid-October.
</P>
<P>
   Few English-speaking travelers come to Ticino, and I was
distressed to see that the gardens' only signs in English were the
ones asking visitors not to pick the flowers (which, incidentally,
I saw several non-English-speakers doing). Without knowing
precisely what I was looking at, I relaxed and followed my nose
around the gardens, enjoying the perfumed air and the views of
nearby alpine peaks.
</P>
<P>
   Lacing on our hiking boots, we rode the electric train the next
day up the wooded Val Centovalli (literally, ``a hundred valleys,''
because of the countless side valleys) to Verdasio, beneath the
snow-capped Pizzo Leone. From there we hopped into a gondola that
carried us 1,400 feet up the mountainside to Monte de Comino. In
Ticino, as elsewhere in Switzerland, one rarely has to hike uphill
unless one really wants to.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting at the top, a steaming bowl of homemade minestrone in
her hands, was Signora Sargenti, known locally as the
``minestronessa.'' She sat us down on the granite terrace of her
restaurant, Al Riposa Romantico, with a sweeping view of the valley
and mountain peaks stretching into Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Her restaurant was a typical Ticino ``grotto.'' The name dates
back to the time when mountain peasants found it easier to locate a
small cave than to dig a cellar for storing food and wine. Many
cafes are still built next to caves, although the word grotto has
now come to mean any rustic Ticino restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Signora Sargenti's minestrone was dense with vegetables grown on
the mountainside above her grotto, and we sopped it up with thick
slabs of crusty brown bread. Next came platters of polenta, beef
stew with carrots, salad, cappuccinos and biscotti. In this
Italian-flavored land, multicourse midday meals are served with an
afternoon nap, rather than a hike, in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, our walk was almost all downhill.

</P>
<P>
   Our path contoured around the mountainside, through pastures
dotted with wildflowers and stone shepherds' huts, and followed a
ridge line as it plunged into a deep, fragrant pine forest. Through
gaps in the trees we caught views of stony villages and terraced
vineyards clinging to distant mountainsides and, at the foot of the
slopes, the blue waters of Lago Maggiore.

TEXAS EXPORTS RISE 13.2 PERCENT IN FIRST QUARTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL BOWEN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texas exports were up 13.2 percent in the first quarter of 1998
from the same period a year ago, outpacing national export growth
by almost 3-to-1, says the Texas Department of Economic
Development.
</P>
<P>
   Texas exports, a key measure of the state's economic health, hit
$22.2 billion in the first quarter and are on track to surpass
1997's record of $84.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The first-quarter export numbers have been widely anticipated as
an indicator of the effect of the Asian economic crisis on Texas
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Although exports to Asia were, indeed, off, those declines were
more than offset by increases in Texas' exports to what are now its
top three trading partners.
</P>
<P>
   Exports to Japan, Texas' third-largest trading partner in the
past, were off 10 percent. Exports to other major Asian
destinations _ Hong Kong, China, South Korea, the Philippines,
Indonesia and Malaysia _ were also down.
</P>
<P>
   But with export sales increasing on almost every other front,
there is little bad news in the report, according to trade experts.
</P>
<P>
   Exports to Texas' largest trading partner, Mexico, were up 25
percent; to Canada, up 17 percent; and to the United Kingdom, up
21.5 percent. The increases were mostly due to increased sales of
computers, electronic equipment, chemicals and transportation
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are seeing is the increasing importance of our NAFTA
trading partners,'' said Branner Stewart, a research analyst for
the Department of Economic Development. ``Not only are they our top
partners, but they own a commanding share of our export growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Exports to Singapore, Venezuela and the Netherlands also posted
increases of 25 percent to 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``What really matters for Texas is the total numbers of
exports,'' said Bernard Weinstein, director of the Center for
Economic Development and Research at the University of North Texas
at Denton. ``If exports to Mexico and Canada grow faster than what
is lost to Asia, we won't be hurt by Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein said the North Texas economy has become tied to trade
growth because of the overseas demand for electronics and other
locally produced goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dallas and Fort Worth have the most export-sensitive economy
in the state,'' Weinstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the decrease in Texas exports to Japan and South Korea
was in chemicals used in manufacturing, according to Department of
Economic Development officials.
</P>
<P>
   Exports to those and other East Asian countries are expected to
decline further through the year as those countries are faced with
buying more manufacturing goods from overseas using currencies that
are worth less.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will have more problems when their inventories are
exhausted,'' said C.A. Sumangil, a senior vice president for trade
finance for Nations Bank in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   But the looming problems in Asia were outshone by the bright
export picture for Texas goods in Mexico, Latin America and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Sales to Mexico jumped to $8.9 billion for the quarter, up from
$7.1 billion during first quarter 1997. Canada was a distant second
at $2.67 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The United Kingdom replaced Japan as the third-largest market
for Texas goods with $703 million. Japan fell to fourth with $687
million in sales.

 LUGANO, Switzerland: of Lago Maggiore.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lower down along the ridge, we came to the old village of Selna,
a smattering of old shepherds' huts and stone barns with slate
roofs. Most were abandoned, the victims of the easier and more
stable livelihoods available in Milan and Locarno, but a few
sprouted solar panels and satellite television dishes. They had
been converted into weekend homes by Locarnans, Morini said.
</P>
<P>
   Our hike the next day was in the Val Verzasca. At Locarno's
train station we hopped aboard a Swiss postal bus, one of the nifty
vehicles that traverse the country's sinuous mountain roads,
delivering passengers _ and the mail _ to remote villages.
</P>
<P>
   The bus climbed a vineyard-covered hillside and entered the
valley, where waterfalls plunged down the sheer limestone walls and
the Verzasca River was a series of emerald pools connected by
frothy cascades. In less than an hour the bus arrived at the end of
the road, the alpine hamlet of Sognogna. Like every village in this
Roman Catholic valley, it was dominated by a towering stone
campanile with church bells that gonged as if to announce our
arrival.
</P>
<P>
   We poked around the town's winding, cobbled streets, but were
soon inundated by German tourists spilling off a tour bus. Passing
a passel of shops selling postcards and Leonardo DiCaprio T-shirts
(he's huge in Ticino), we gulped down a quick cappuccino in a
grotto, shouldered our day packs and hit the trail.
</P>
<P>
   The broad, gentle path meandered down the valley through a
forest of chestnut and oak, crisscrossing the river on arched stone
bridges, always staying on the opposite side from the road.
</P>
<P>
   In no time we'd left Leonardo DiCaprio behind and entered a
world unchanged for centuries. Here many of the stone shepherd huts
and barns were still in use. Above the village of Gerra we heard a
metallic tinkling and rounded a corner to find a herd of black,
bearded billy goats grazing in an idyllic pasture and drinking out
of a stone fountain and trough built in the 1600s.
</P>
<P>
   By the time we'd reached Lavertezzo, with its picturesque
double-arched stone bridge _ the Ponte del Salti _ I was famished.
We ducked into the first grotto we saw, and shortly I was tucking
into the signature dish of Ticino, ``risotto al funghi'' _ saucy
rice with pungent forest mushrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The next day we thought we'd try another gentle, down-valley
walk in the Val Maggia. When the postal bus delivered us to the
hamlet of Cavergno, however, a chilly mist was spilling over the
crest of the Alps from northern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes down the valley, in the village of Bignasco, we
jumped aboard another postal bus and within an hour were back in
bright sunshine, walking along the lakeside promenade in Ascona,
past palm trees and flower gardens.
</P>
<P>
   This colorful, inviting town, filled with galleries and museums,
is the Sante Fe of Ticino, attracting writers and artists from all
over the Continent, including, over the years, Hermann Hesse and
Paul Klee.
</P>
<P>
   Peeling off our polarfleece, we found a table in a cafe along
the promenade and ordered a bottle of white Merlot. And that's how
we spent the afternoon _ soaking up the balmy Mediterranean sun,
inhaling the fragrant breeze and watching the lake steamers out in
Lago Maggiore, crisscrossing between Switzerland and Italy.

TUSCAN RECIPES FROM NANCY JENKINS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHERYL JULIAN 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   These recipes have been adapted from ``Flavors of Tuscany.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
RED CROSTINI WITH TOMATOES
</P>
<P>
   (Crostini rossi)
</P>
<P>
   Red crostini are made at summer's height, when tomatoes come
right out of the garden. Be careful with the red pepper _ Tuscan
food should be gently suffused with the heat of chili peppers, but
not so hot you run for the water pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   1 garlic clove, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 pounds tomatoes, peeled, seeded, juiced, and chopped
</P>
<P>
   1/2 small dried hot chili pepper, finely chopped, or 1/4
teaspoon crushed red chili pepper
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   6 to 8 slices country-style bread (1 inch thick)
</P>
<P>
   Fresh basil leaves, for garnish
</P>
<P>
   In a medium frying pan, gently sweat the garlic in 1 tablespoon
of the olive oil until soft but not brown. Add the tomatoes and
chili pepper, stir, and simmer gently 10 to 15 minutes. Taste and
season with salt and pepper. Continue simmering for 45 minutes, or
until the tomatoes are thoroughly dissolved and make a chunky
sauce. Stir occasionally and add a little boiling water if the
sauce gets too dry.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a food mill, put the sauce through the disk with the
largest holes. Or process briefly in a food processor to make sauce
with a thick texture that's not too smooth. If the sauce is too
liquid, return it to the pan and simmer again until most of the
liquid has boiled away and it becomes a dense paste.
</P>
<P>
   Slice the bread about the thickness of a finger and cut each
slice in 2. Toast the bread on both sides and drizzle with the
remaining olive oil, or saute the bread in the olive oil. Spoon the
sauce onto the bread. Garnish with the basil leaves, if you wish.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 6 to 8.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
MIXED SUMMER VEGETABLES
</P>
<P>
   (Misto di verdura dell' orto)
</P>
<P>
   Summer days are very long in Tuscany. Mita Antolini often uses
the late, cool hours to work in her vegetable garden, weeding,
watering, and transplanting. When it's time to start supper, she
strolls back down the rows, picking up a little of this, a little
of that, rinses what she's gathered at the outside faucet, and
takes it inside to put together with a little olive oil, some fresh
herbs, and garlic. The ingredients change from one day to the next,
but here's one example.
</P>
<P>
   2 garlic cloves, crushed
</P>
<P>
   2 white onions, sliced
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   4 tomatoes, still a little streaked with green, cut in wedges
</P>
<P>
   5 small zucchini, sliced about 1/4-inch thick
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound green beens, trimmed and cut into 1-inch lengths
</P>
<P>
   1 small bunch chard, slivered
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch flat-leaf parsley, chopped
</P>
<P>
   12 zucchini flowers, cut in strips
</P>
<P>
   4 branches fresh basil, leaves only, slivered
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   In a frying pan large enough to hold all the vegetables (keeping
in mind that they will cook down), gently saute the garlic and
onions in the olive oil over medium-low heat until the onions are
very soft but not turning brown, about 10 minutes. Add the tomatoes
and zucchini, turn the heat up to medium, and stir to mix well.
Cover the pan and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until
the zucchini have softened slightly and the tomatoes start to give
off some off their juice, another 10 minutes. Now add the green
beans, chard, and parsley, and stir again. If the mixture seems
dry, add 1/2 cup of water. Cook quite briskly, covered, until the
green beans are tender, occasionally adding a little more water if
necessary. This will take another 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, stir in the zucchini flowers and basil. Stir and taste,
adding salt and pepper. Let cook 5 minutes more, then serve
immediately. Or let it cool to room temperature and serve.
</P>
<P>
   This is delicious on its own, as a first course. You can also
convert it into a main course for lunch or supper by poaching 1 egg
per person in a separate pan of gently simmering water. Then place
the eggs on top of the vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4.
</P>
<P>
   TOMATO-BREAD SOUP
</P>
<P>
   (Pappa al pomodoro)
</P>
<P>
   This is a very dense soup, more like an old-fashioned porridge
than a liquid broth.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ufrecipe &LR;
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds fresh red ripe tomatoes, cut into chunks
</P>
<P>
   1 medium yellow onion, peeled and coarsely chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 medium carrot, coarsely chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 stalk celery, coarsely chopped
</P>
<P>
   5 sprigs flat-leaf parsley
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil (plus extra for garnish)
</P>
<P>
   2 garlic cloves, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound country-style bread, crusts removed
</P>
<P>
   1 stalk basil (plus extra for garnish)
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of sugar
</P>
<P>
   Place the tomatoes, onion, carrot, celery, and parsley in a soup
kettle with about 1/4 cup of water. Bring to a boil and cook,
uncovered, for about 20 minutes, or until the vegetables are all
very soft. Midway through the cooking, taste and add salt and
pepper. If necessary, add a little boiling water to the pan from
time to time to keep the vegetables from sticking. When the
vegetables are tender, remove the kettle from the heat and allow it
to cool a little. Then put the sauce through the fine disk of a
food mill. Strain the resulting puree and set it aside. You should
have about 3 cups.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oil in a soup pot over medium-low heat. Add the garlic
and cook, stirring, until it softens. Do not let it color.
</P>
<P>
   While the garlic is cooking, tear the bread into big pieces and
add them to the pan, with the basil and 2 cups of boiling water.
Stir with a wooden spoon to break up the bread and add more boiling
water from time to time, up to 1 cup. When the bread has thoroughly
broken down and absorbed the water, stir in 2 1/2 cups of the
tomato puree. Taste again to adjust the seasoning and add a little
sugar if needed. Cook over very low heat, stirring frequently, for
1 hour. Add a little more boiling water or hot tomato sauce to
prevent sticking.
</P>
<P>
   When the soup is done, set it aside to cool to room temperature
(do not refrigerate). Remove and discard the basil. Taste the soup
and adjust the seasoning if necessary. Ladle into bowls and drizzle
with a bit of the olive oil, then garnish with a few basil leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 6 to 8.

NANCY JENKINS COOKS UP THE SUNNY WORLD OF TUSCANY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHERYL JULIAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Twenty-five years ago, when Nancy Harmon Jenkins bought a
run-down farmhouse in Teverina, in the northern Italian region of
Tuscany, the area had made so few concessions to modern times that
farm animals were stabled under the houses in the winter. Jenkins
has seen the arrival of electricity, and with it television,
telephones, and refrigerators. Indoor plumbing has come, along with
washing machines. Now there are grand weddings for the children,
and the houses have separate kitchens so that every family event
(except sleep, birth, and death) no longer takes place in one great
room. But what surprises Jenkins most is not the technology that
filtered to the mountain village but subtler changes that eased
into Tuscan farm life _ like the pineapple upside-down cake
Jenkins's neighbor served her several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It might as well have jumped out of the pages of Better Homes &AMP;
Gardens, said Jenkins during a recent visit to Boston. The
pineapple came right out of a can. ``I had never heard of anyone in
Italy making one,'' she says. But Tuscans _ like villagers
worldwide _ are enamored of what is new, she concedes. ``And
there's so much more in the air now.''
</P>
<P>
   It works both ways. Tuscany was the first region of Italy
American chefs turned to when they decided to lighten their food,
discarding the old red sauces common to Italian-American cooking.
Crusty breads, oils for dipping, simple grilled entrees are
standard menu fare as is the ubiquitous tiramisu. Long before the
American larder was stocked with handmade pastas, focaccia, and
sun-dried tomatoes, Jenkins was in the kitchen in Italy, cooking
with her neighbors. Though many cooks are well versed in Tuscan
cooking, Nancy Jenkins is unquestionably the established authority.
And her new ``Flavors of Tuscany'' (Broadway Books) is bound to
become the definitive guide.
</P>
<P>
   The role of authority suits her. She's a food scholar who has
lived in Spain, Lebanon, and Cyprus, and has traveled extensively
around the Mediterranean. She joined The New York Times Living
section to cover food at one point, served as editor of the Journal
of Gastronomy for the American Institute of Wine and Food, and
taught Mediterranean food history at the Radcliffe Seminars at
Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   She began her writing career early. As a student at Wellesley
College (class of 1959), she and her Harvard College friend Bill
Bayer wrote ``Love With a Harvard Accent'' under the pseudonym
Leonie St. John. (Bayer is now married to cookbook author Paula
Wolfert.) Since then, Jenkins has written ``The Boat Beneath the
Pyramid'' (a study of ancient Egyptian boats), ``The Mediterranean
Diet Cookbook'' and ``Flavors of Puglia.'' She divides her time
between Tuscany and Camden, Maine, where she was raised.
</P>
<P>
   She landed in Italy &UR;  &LR; as a young mother, then married to Loren
Jenkins, a foreign correspondent based in Europe, now an
international editor &UR;  &LR; at National Public Radio. Their children _
Sara, now 33, and Nicolas, 28 _ used to play with the children on
neighboring farms.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Jenkins remembers when most local farmers raised wheat
instead of turning to tobacco for the cash, when women baked the
traditional salt-free bread in wood-fired ovens, and when there was
hardly any need to buy food. ``It's the rapidity of change today
that's most striking,'' she writes.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, she says, the industrious Tuscans are still tending
their olive trees, turning their olives into oil, harvesting summer
crops for the table, slaughtering chickens and pigs, making
sausages and smoking pork legs, pruning their orchards, and boiling
conserves from the fruit.
</P>
<P>
   And they eat and celebrate in large numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hospitality on such a Homeric scale,'' Jenkins writes, ``is
what continues to bind together Tuscan villages like Teverina,
where family pride is displayed in the simple abundance of a table
on which almost all the dishes represent the fruits of the family's
own labor.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins's table in Teverina is often crowded with guests,
although she doesn't raise vegetables and livestock. In fact, it
took years to turn the farm into a habitable residence. The
property agent who showed her the house, she says, came armed with
a stick to scare away snakes. She dreams of turning her land into
an organic olive tree grove, but she's making only a little headway
in raising the trees. ``I planted 200, lost 50, and I get a couple
liters of good oil. Several neighbors put their olives together
because you need a certain number to take to the press.''
</P>
<P>
   During her visit, she conducted an olive-oil tasting at
restaurant Tosca in Hingham, while chef Joe Simone cooked recipes
from her book. Over the years, Jenkins has become knowledgeable
about olive harvests, modern extracting machines, and how the
residents around the Mediterranean produce oils.
</P>
<P>
   She showed how to taste oil. ``Take a sip,'' she advises, ``then
add air to your mouth and make a sucking sound. It's a very rude
sound.'' The air brings out grassy or citrusy tastes and other
flavors, she says. Tuscan oil, which she is partial to, is
characterized by its peppery taste because ``the olives are
harvested when they're so young.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oils for tasting are all extra virgin. It's like fine wine as
opposed to jug wine. They're not refined. The olives have been
extracted mechanically without solvents or chemicals,'' she
explains, ``and they don't taste of mud, must, or rancidity.''
</P>
<P>
   At home, Jenkins uses only extra-virgin olive oil, the best on
the market. She admits to deep-fat frying with it, though she says
producers send her oil, so she isn't popping a cork on a $30 bottle
to make fritters. ``Nothing in the world fries as well as olive
oil,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   When she's traveling and finds an oil she likes, she tries to
get some shipped to the specialty and take-out market in Rockport,
Maine, that she owns with her sister, Jane Carr, and Carr's
catering partner, Sarah Greer. The chef is Nelda McClellan, who
worked at the former Michela's in Cambridge and Biba in Boston, and
now lives in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The partners bought the shop, called the Market Basket, a year
ago. ``Jane and Sarah are the working partners,'' says Jenkins. ``I
like to think of myself as roaming the globe and finding products.
Actually, I go in once in a while to get chocolate peanut butter
candies.''
</P>
<P>
   The Market Basket is at the crossroads of Route 90 and Route 1,
and there is more traffic than ever since MBNA Corp., the
credit-card company, opened offices nearby. Though the facade is
dreary, says Jenkins, ``we can't keep up with the demand.''
</P>
<P>
   When she returns to Maine, she remembers what it is about
Tuscany that draws her. ``I think of the plain-spoken Tuscans as
the Yankees of Italy,'' she writes, ``which may be one reason why
Tuscany appeals so much to rock-ribbed Yankees like me.'' Another
element surely is the pragmatic way they use their land and cook
their meals. Maine Yankees, like Tuscans, subscribe to a
``use-it-up, wear-it-out, make-it-do, or do-without'' sensibility,
she says.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout her cookbook, chapters open with sepia-toned
photographs of the Antolinis, Jenkins's neighbors in Teverina. All
the photos were taken by Nicolas and Sara Jenkins. Sara, who worked
as a chef at Figs in Charlestown for several years, now cooks at a
restaurant in Florence.
</P>
<P>
   The lives of these neighbors open a window into the landscape of
Tuscan life. Mita Antolini, at 70, looks considerably older than
Jenkins (who is 10 years younger) from a harder life. She's the
matriarch of a family that includes her husband, Bruno, and their
three children and their spouses. The only son, Arnaldo, started
raising tobacco when he took over the farm.
</P>
<P>
   Antolini taught Jenkins to make bread in the beehive oven set
into a side wall of her house, then toast the same bread into
crostini and top it with ripe tomatoes sauteed to a pulpy
consistency. And to celebrate a wheat or tobacco or olive harvest,
she taught her how to make feather-light lasagnas.
</P>
<P>
   When Arnaldo Antolini married his longtime sweetheart, Maura,
they began renovations on the house. They raised the roof and made
their living quarters downstairs. ``They live in an apartment
underneath the house _ where the stables once were,'' says Jenkins.
</P>
<P>
   Maura is in charge of cooking meals for family celebrations,
which might include 30 or 40 relatives of many generations. On this
table goes the real food of Tuscany: livers from their own fowl,
sauteed and mashed with capers and anchovies; back-yard chickens
roasted in the wood-fueled oven; and wild greens collected from the
land for a salad. To this, Mita Antolini might add the tiniest
violets, collected on the farm that morning. She saw this done on
television and copied it as soon as she had the chance. Maura might
produce one of her favorite desserts: the fried cream puff called
bombolini. She no longer fills it with homemade custard but rather
with a nutty-chocolate cream _ spooned directly from a jar.
</P>
<P>
   Tuscan cuisine, writes Jenkins, is born out of history and
geography. Where descendants of the Etruscans, Romans, and ancient
Umbrians meet on the hills of Chianti and the valleys near
Florence, the air is redolent with change.

WHATEVER HAS HAPPENED TO THE WAITER?
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALISON ARNETT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The scenario will sound familiar: You and your friends have
sipped your coffee and nibbled desserts. The possible topics of
conversation have pretty much been covered, and the latest photos
of your kids admired several times. In fact, for the past several
minutes, you've sat in silence, all wondering the same thing: Where
is the check? What happened to that waiter? What is going on?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is today's all-purpose reply to any and every
question: It's the booming economy. State unemployment is 2.9
percent _ the lowest rate since 1987. There's a ferment of
restaurants opening, upscaling, and enlarging as good times and
'90s lifestyle trends fuel more dining out.
</P>
<P>
   Finding waiters and waitresses to meet the level of service
demanded by today's customer is a daunting task. Asian restaurants
all over town have ``Help wanted'' signs in the windows. Large
restaurants are running ads in the newspapers. Artists who have
given up the waiting trade, in which so many of them make ends
meet, report calls from former employers and colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   New restaurants are especially stretching to fill wait staff
rosters. ``It's been very difficult,'' says Johanne Killeen, who
with her husband, George Germon, took over Cafe Louis in Back Bay
in late April. Killeen says they've been ``getting some applicants
but not as many as I would have expected.'' It's been hard to find
the right kind of applicants, she adds. Killeen and Germon also own
Al Forno in Providence, long known for friendly, knowledgeable, and
extremely competent wait staff, and she speaks passionately about
wanting their new apple-green bandbox of a cafe to be remembered
for the same casual but nurturing service. Killeen thought it would
be easier to gather wait staff in Boston than in Rhode Island but
is discovering the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   And putting together a staff takes time, Killeen says,
especially when training 20 or so people. ``People have to learn to
trust you, and you them,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Bor, the Colonnade Hotel's human resources director,
hires staff for both the hotel and its new restaurant, Brasserie
Jo. The big glitzy restaurant is owned by Jean Joho and Lettuce
Entertain You Inc. of Chicago. Bor says publicity about the place
and the name recognition of Lettuce Entertain You ``drew some
professional wait staff'' right away.
</P>
<P>
   Brasserie Jo is ``really doing the numbers,'' he says, making it
very attractive to wait staff, who depend on tips for a great part
of their earnings. However, Bor is quick to add, when the ``buzz
has passed its prime, we're in with the rest of the food
establishments'' vying for staff. In the last two years, finding
workers in all categories for the hotel has been ``getting tighter
and tighter.''
</P>
<P>
   He sees much advantage in being able to promote from within and
finds that moving a promising worker from the hotel housekeeping
staff to a busing job or back-waiter position in the restaurant is
often successful. ``I don't want somebody who's going to stay a day
or a week. Coming from a hotel perspective, I'm always trying to
bring turnover down.''
</P>
<P>
   The hotel, and thus the restaurant, is union property, Bor says,
and the pay is above the union wage ``at every level, and benefits
are included,'' a real advantage in hiring. A good training program
also helps, says Bor, so employees aren't set up for failure.
``Training is an integral part of advancement. Employees are very
aware if the company is spending time training them, knowing that
`this company is making sure I do a good job.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bor also collaborates with the Fenway Community Development
Corporation to help people coming from transitional assistance into
the workplace and with the Madison Park High School to Work
program. ``There's no question unemployment is down,'' Bor says,
``and it behooves all of us to find future workers in every nook
and cranny.'' Those workers probably wouldn't immediately help the
food and beverage end but might eventually, he adds.
</P>
<P>
   College students have traditionally been a pool of possible wait
staff, but Yusupha Ceesay, manager of the Elephant Walk in Boston,
says it's hard to fit the flexibility students want into the needs
of a busy restaurant. However, he says, most of the applicants are
students.
</P>
<P>
   Inexperience is another problem. ``Most people have never waited
at a restaurant before,'' Ceesay says, ``and it's hard at a
restaurant like the Elephant Walk because of the volume.'' He has
been extending training time for people who are not students but
have no experience, adding that ``two really worked.''
</P>
<P>
   On Cape Cod and the islands, where college students have
traditionally flocked for summer employment, the situation is also
tight, but many established restaurants find students aren't the
answer. Savoir Faire owner Scott Caskey in Edgartown on Martha's
Vineyard says, ``The days of college kids coming down here and
spending a couple of months waiting tables are over.'' His
restaurant opens in April, shutting out college students. More
crucially, housing on the island is scarce and very expensive.
``With the soaring economy, the real estate market is hotter than a
pistol,'' he adds. His restaurant depends on an ``almost 100
percent return'' of workers who have winter jobs at Boston
restaurants or at ski resorts. The manager at Nauset Beach Club in
East Orleans says the restaurant stays open year-round and the wait
staff will supplement slow months in the winter with part-time
jobs, knowing they'll make more in the busy summer months.
</P>
<P>
   From the restaurants' perspective, the employment outlook
doesn't show any signs of easing. Fred Breimyer, chief economist of
State Street Bank, says this is the tightest labor market of the
'90s. It was expected, but the degree is surprising even the
economists, he adds. The surge in jobs in this segment of the
service industry was predicted, according to the state's industry
occupation projections. In 1994, such jobs were estimated at about
51,000; for the year 2005, the estimate is almost 62,000.

   Mary-Catherine Deibel, co-owner of Up Stairs at the Pudding in
Harvard Square, says that as the entire culinary profession has
become more attractive, wait staff jobs have become more
attractive, too. It's ``no longer odious,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Customers are no longer shy about dining out and insist on a
higher level of service than once was common in American
restaurants. ``They expect a lot more and they deserve it,'' she
says, so getting and keeping a good wait staff is imperative. Many
at her restaurant have been there for years, but the wait staff
must form a team and yet welcome newcomers. ``We try to listen to
their concerns,'' Deibel says, adding that over the years she has
added management staff. Then the wait staff is ``asked only to
concentrate on service to the customer.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the hunt for wait staff continues, looking for a few
good men and women. ``We love it when we find a pro who's not on
the way from point A to point B and plans on this as a career,''
says Johanne Killeen of Cafe Louis. ``We don't look for a specific
person but for ones who like people and want to please them.''

   Getting around: A Swiss Pass covers travel on almost all rail
roads, all postal buses and most urban buses and lake steamers
(although not the ones in lakes Lugano and Maggio that are operated
by the Italians), plus discounts on funiculars and gondolas.
</P>
<P>
   Cost for a second-class pass ranges from $188 for four
consecutive days to $400 for an entire month. Passes also entitle
your companion to travel at a 40 percent discount.
</P>
<P>
   Where to stay: In Lugano we stayed at the Hotel International au
Lac, Via Nassa 68, 6901 Lugano, Switzerland; phone:
011-41-91-922-75-41; fax: 011-41-91-922-75-44. Doubles with bath
start at 180 Swiss Francs (about $120.) Although in expensive by
Swiss standards, it was elegant, spotless and well- located.
</P>
<P>
   In Locarno we stayed at the Villa Pauliska Hotel &AMP; Ristorante,
6600 Mutalto, Via Orsalino 6, Locarno, Switzerland; phone:
011-41-91-743-05-41. Doubles with baths ran from 120 to 150 Swiss
Francs (about $81 to $100.) We stayed in the Green Room, which was
tiny; it's worth paying more for one of the others. The hotel is a
bit far from the center of town if you're on foot, and the staff
seemed to be focusing its attention more on the restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Where to eat: The Villa Pauliska in Locarno served what were,
without a doubt, the best meals I've eaten in Switzerland. The
dishes were inventive and well-prepared, the dining room was
gorgeous and the service was attentive and delightfully unstuffy.
Four-course fixed- price dinners are 58 Swiss Francs (about $39),
not including wine. Definitely worth a splurge. Reservations
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   What to do: Lugano offers a free, highly recommended walking
tour. Offered on Mondays from April through October, the tour meets
at 9:30 a.m. at the Santa Maria degli Angioli church, where Via
Nassa hits the lake, and runs until 11:45 a.m. Reservations
required: 011-41-91-921-4664. Locarno's tours cost 10 Swiss Francs
per adult, half price for children 7-16, children under 7 free. The
tours are offered Mondays from April 13 to Oct. 30. Meet at the
Casino Locarno at 9:45 a.m.; tours run until 11:30 a.m.
Reservations are required: 011-41-91-751-9070.

FOR THE BEST MEALS (AND VIEWS) AROUND, TRY A PICNIC 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June 14)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN FLINN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Out table had one of the best views in Italy: A breathtaking
sunset vista across the Bay of Naples to the golden isles of Ischia
and Procida and the Sorrento Peninsula, with the cone of Mount
Vesuvius brooding over everything.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of view for which diners would gladly pay
extraordinary prices, but it wasn't costing us a single lira.
Actually, ``table'' isn't quite the right word: our dinner on the
island of Capri was a picnic on a park bench.
</P>
<P>
   Some of my most memorable traveling meals have been picnics: a
bagful of charcuterie goodies and a bottle of Cotes du Rhone on the
steps of Sacre Coeur in Paris; street-vendor falafels and Stella
Lager on the banks of the Nile; a wedge of Emmentaler cheese, a
tart green apple and some Tobblerone overlooking a glacier in the
Swiss Alps.
</P>
<P>
   Jeri and I started having picnics as a way to save money: eating
every lunch and dinner in a restaurant is a budget-buster,
particularly on long trips. But over the years we've found that we
look forward to them even when money is not an issue.
</P>
<P>
   On Capri, we wanted to enjoy the sunset view at dinner, but
found that, for the most part, Capri Town had squandered one of the
best vistas in that corner of the world. On Via Roma, the main
traffic street, the side with the view was taken up by a bus
station, two video arcades and a handful of gift shops. There was a
restaurant or two with window views, but their menus didn't tempt
us. However, right off Piazza Umberto I, where the funicular comes
up from Marina Grande, there were a couple of benches offering that
world-class view for free.
</P>
<P>
   Half the fun of a picnic is assembling it. Scrutinizing the
melons at open-air produce stands, sniffing the camemberts and
Roqueforts in pungent fromageries and pondering over baguettes in
boulangeries is a wonderful way to get inside the everyday life of
the community. There's no better conversational icebreaker than to
ask a signora her opinion of the day's tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   An hour before sunset, as the last of the day-trippers was
leaving the island, we began our shopping expedition in Capri Town,
joining the local shoppers thronging through the cool, whitewashed
alleys. Our noses led us to one good-smelling shop _ there was no
name above the door _ where we had the man behind the counter cut
us several thin slices of salty prosciutto from Parma and a thick
chunk of gooey, funky-smelling Gorgonzola cheese. I also had him
count out six dark, musty olives, each half the size of a golf
ball. Cost: 8,000 lire (about $4.60.)
</P>
<P>
   Down the street, at a produce market, we bought two sweet,
vine-ripened tomatoes, a 1.5-liter bottle of aqua minerale and a
ripe-smelling cantaloupe. Yikes! When the woman rang up our
purchases, the melon alone came to 8,500 lire _ about $4.90.
(Moral: always confirm the price of everything before buying.)
</P>
<P>
   With the water and the tomatoes, the bill at the produce market
totaled 12,600 lire _ $7.25.
</P>
<P>
   Around the corner, we bought a half-loaf of crusty bread and
examined the wine bottles on the shelf. What amazed me was how
cheap they all were: Italians tend to think of wine as an everyday
ingredient of meals, not a splurge, and price it accordingly. After
some consideration, we chose a bottle of Tiberio Vino da Tavola
Rosso _ a red table wine produced up the road in Anacapri and named
for the Emporer Tiberius, who once ran the Roman Empire from a
villa on Capri and, persistent local rumor has it, hosted
spectacular orgies. The wine, according to its label, had won a
``gran premio'' award at a Buenos Aires competition in 1910 and
another at Rome in 1926, although things apparently have slowed
down quite a bit since then in the awards department.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was only 6,000 lire (about $3.45.) With the bread, the
bill at that shop came to 7,000 lire (about $4), bringing the total
for the entire meal to 27,600 lire (about $15.85) _ nearly a third
of which was the cantaloupe.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving our hotel, we'd grabbed two glasses out of our
room and borrowed two plates and two forks from the kitchen. I also
had my picnic kit, which contains a tea towel, a Swiss Army knife,
a plastic spreading knife (added to the kit after I gummed up my
previous Swiss Army knife with runny cheeses and peanut butter) and
some Handi Wipes.
</P>
<P>
   We got to the bench just as the setting sun was turning the
sweeping panorama golden. Spreading out the tea towel as a
tablecloth, we cut the cantaloupe into little slices (best
cantaloupe I've ever had, by the way; almost worth the price) and
wrapped them in the prosciutto. We tore off chunks of bread and
smeared Gorgonzola on them and dropped olives and slices of tomato
into our mouths, washing it all down with the mineral water and the
surprisingly drinkable Tiberio.
</P>
<P>
   Across the bay, the last light of day was shining on the island
of Procida, where they filmed ``Il Postino'' (``The Postman''). The
lights of Naples were starting to twinkle. Along Via Roma the
citizens of Capri Town, dressed up in their finest, were beginning
their passegiata _ their evening stroll around town.
</P>
<P>
   It was a scene we couldn't have matched in a restaurant _ at any
price.

TUSCAN RECIPES FROM NANCY JENKINS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHERYL JULIAN 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   These recipes have been adapted from ``Flavors of Tuscany.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
RED CROSTINI WITH TOMATOES
</P>
<P>
   (Crostini rossi)
</P>
<P>
   Red crostini are made at summer's height, when tomatoes come
right out of the garden. Be careful with the red pepper _ Tuscan
food should be gently suffused with the heat of chili peppers, but
not so hot you run for the water pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   1 garlic clove, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 pounds tomatoes, peeled, seeded, juiced, and chopped
</P>
<P>
   1/2 small dried hot chili pepper, finely chopped, or 1/4
teaspoon crushed red chili pepper
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   6 to 8 slices country-style bread (1 inch thick)
</P>
<P>
   Fresh basil leaves, for garnish
</P>
<P>
   In a medium frying pan, gently sweat the garlic in 1 tablespoon
of the olive oil until soft but not brown. Add the tomatoes and
chili pepper, stir, and simmer gently 10 to 15 minutes. Taste and
season with salt and pepper. Continue simmering for 45 minutes, or
until the tomatoes are thoroughly dissolved and make a chunky
sauce. Stir occasionally and add a little boiling water if the
sauce gets too dry.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a food mill, put the sauce through the disk with the
largest holes. Or process briefly in a food processor to make sauce
with a thick texture that's not too smooth. If the sauce is too
liquid, return it to the pan and simmer again until most of the
liquid has boiled away and it becomes a dense paste.
</P>
<P>
   Slice the bread about the thickness of a finger and cut each
slice in 2. Toast the bread on both sides and drizzle with the
remaining olive oil, or saute the bread in the olive oil. Spoon the
sauce onto the bread. Garnish with the basil leaves, if you wish.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 6 to 8.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
MIXED SUMMER VEGETABLES
</P>
<P>
   (Misto di verdura dell' orto)
</P>
<P>
   Summer days are very long in Tuscany. Mita Antolini often uses
the late, cool hours to work in her vegetable garden, weeding,
watering, and transplanting. When it's time to start supper, she
strolls back down the rows, picking up a little of this, a little
of that, rinses what she's gathered at the outside faucet, and
takes it inside to put together with a little olive oil, some fresh
herbs, and garlic. The ingredients change from one day to the next,
but here's one example.
</P>
<P>
   2 garlic cloves, crushed
</P>
<P>
   2 white onions, sliced
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   4 tomatoes, still a little streaked with green, cut in wedges
</P>
<P>
   5 small zucchini, sliced about 1/4-inch thick
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound green beens, trimmed and cut into 1-inch lengths
</P>
<P>
   1 small bunch chard, slivered
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch flat-leaf parsley, chopped
</P>
<P>
   12 zucchini flowers, cut in strips
</P>
<P>
   4 branches fresh basil, leaves only, slivered
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   In a frying pan large enough to hold all the vegetables (keeping
in mind that they will cook down), gently saute the garlic and
onions in the olive oil over medium-low heat until the onions are
very soft but not turning brown, about 10 minutes. Add the tomatoes
and zucchini, turn the heat up to medium, and stir to mix well.
Cover the pan and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until
the zucchini have softened slightly and the tomatoes start to give
off some off their juice, another 10 minutes. Now add the green
beans, chard, and parsley, and stir again. If the mixture seems
dry, add 1/2 cup of water. Cook quite briskly, covered, until the
green beans are tender, occasionally adding a little more water if
necessary. This will take another 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, stir in the zucchini flowers and basil. Stir and taste,
adding salt and pepper. Let cook 5 minutes more, then serve
immediately. Or let it cool to room temperature and serve.
</P>
<P>
   This is delicious on its own, as a first course. You can also
convert it into a main course for lunch or supper by poaching 1 egg
per person in a separate pan of gently simmering water. Then place
the eggs on top of the vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4.
</P>
<P>
   TOMATO-BREAD SOUP
</P>
<P>
   (Pappa al pomodoro)
</P>
<P>
   This is a very dense soup, more like an old-fashioned porridge
than a liquid broth.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ufrecipe &LR;
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds fresh red ripe tomatoes, cut into chunks
</P>
<P>
   1 medium yellow onion, peeled and coarsely chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 medium carrot, coarsely chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 stalk celery, coarsely chopped
</P>
<P>
   5 sprigs flat-leaf parsley
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil (plus extra for garnish)
</P>
<P>
   2 garlic cloves, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound country-style bread, crusts removed
</P>
<P>
   1 stalk basil (plus extra for garnish)
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of sugar
</P>
<P>
   Place the tomatoes, onion, carrot, celery, and parsley in a soup
kettle with about 1/4 cup of water. Bring to a boil and cook,
uncovered, for about 20 minutes, or until the vegetables are all
very soft. Midway through the cooking, taste and add salt and
pepper. If necessary, add a little boiling water to the pan from
time to time to keep the vegetables from sticking. When the
vegetables are tender, remove the kettle from the heat and allow it
to cool a little. Then put the sauce through the fine disk of a
food mill. Strain the resulting puree and set it aside. You should
have about 3 cups.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oil in a soup pot over medium-low heat. Add the garlic
and cook, stirring, until it softens. Do not let it color.
</P>
<P>
   While the garlic is cooking, tear the bread into big pieces and
add them to the pan, with the basil and 2 cups of boiling water.
Stir with a wooden spoon to break up the bread and add more boiling
water from time to time, up to 1 cup. When the bread has thoroughly
broken down and absorbed the water, stir in 2 1/2 cups of the
tomato puree. Taste again to adjust the seasoning and add a little
sugar if needed. Cook over very low heat, stirring frequently, for
1 hour. Add a little more boiling water or hot tomato sauce to
prevent sticking.
</P>
<P>
   When the soup is done, set it aside to cool to room temperature
(do not refrigerate). Remove and discard the basil. Taste the soup
and adjust the seasoning if necessary. Ladle into bowls and drizzle
with a bit of the olive oil, then garnish with a few basil leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 6 to 8.

MAGIC JOHNSON'S SHOW NEEDS A LITTLE MORE WORK
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE MAGIC SHOW
</P>
<P>
   Starring Magic Johnson
</P>
<P>
   11:30 p.m.-12:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Mon.-Fri. on Fox, Ch. 25.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's tough to judge a season on an opening-night performance _
you need only recall the Celtics' season-opening victory over the
champion Chicago Bulls to get the point.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, Magic Johnson, one of the smartest players in the
history of the National Basketball Association, sought to spread
his influence, transferring his formidable skills from the
basketball court to a talk show on Fox.
</P>
<P>
   If Magic thought the NBA schedule was tough, it's a kid's game
compared with the persistent pressure under the glaring lights of a
five-day-a-week talk show.
</P>
<P>
   Based on opening night, it looks as if Magic's showtime is off
to a slow start. He negotiated the essential hurdle to becoming a
successful host _ he listened to his guests; however, none of them
had much to say.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Schwarzenegger tore down Magic's dressing room door and
showed a vintage clip of his TV debut with Lucille Ball and
answered questions from the audience. Question: ``What's the
heaviest thing you ever lifted?'' Answer: ``Magic's wallet.''
</P>
<P>
   After 10 minutes of backslapping with Arnold, Magic brought out
Whitney Houston, who also praised him for having his own show. They
briefly argued over who has won the most awards. Before one
digested this treacly moment, they started talking about how
problematic it is being recognized. So what do they think show
business is about? Anonymity? Then, she vacuumed the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Just before presenting Houston with a Laker jersey with her name
and his number on the back, Johnson slam-jammed her with another
puffball asking if there was going to be a sequel to ``The
Bodyguard.''
</P>
<P>
   As the night wore on, Magic seemed to get a little less nervous,
a little more relaxed. But he's got to ditch the hyperbole.
Everyone can't be the greatest star in the world.
</P>
<P>
   One of the problems is that Magic Johnson seems to be a nice
guy. And that's the quickest way to die on TV. He needs a few of
Letterman's mischievous stunts and Arsenio Hall's satiric smarts.
He should take a week's worth of lessons from the lamented Garry
Shandling. More spice. Maybe they should have asked Bill Lambier,
the much-despised former Detroit Pistons star, to be an
opening-night guest. At least that would raise the chance for a
little conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Someone should also tell Magic to stop doing the job of the
audience. We're the ones who are supposed to be sitting down and
laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Just before ``The Magic Show'' ended, musical director Sheila E.
performed a song with the repetitive lyric ``Magic's got his own
show.'' Stunt artiste Ray Wold finished off the night by setting
himself on fire. If only the rest of the show were as hot.

   Barcelona is a walker's paradise, especially this time of year.
To saunter through its Gothic Quarter, along the dark, narrow
streets and past the ancient artisans' shops, is to be transported
back to the Middle Ages. Walk up Passeig de Gracia, past the chic
boutiques and the daring, whimsical buildings by Antonio Gaudi,
Barcelona's favorite architectural son, and it is easy to
appreciate why this city is known as Spain's capital of design.

wine tours that show off the best of Europe's vineyards and
wineries. Potter offers a taste in this feature.

WHY DOES WEEKLY STANDARD TREAT GOLDWATER WITH KID GLOVES?
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK FEENEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The odd thing isn't that Barry Goldwater's on the cover of  &UR; The
Weekly Standard  &LR; (June 16). It's that the Standard's treatment of
such a conservative icon should be so ... gingerly. This was the
man who started America's move rightward, after all, and without
whom Ronald Reagan (who made himself a national political figure
with his election-eve speech on Goldwater's behalf) would never
have gotten east of Death Valley. Yet the slightly affronted tone
here recalls that of a ventriloquist annoyed with his dummy.
Goldwater ``was not entirely serious about politics or
government,'' Robert D. Novak grumps. He was ``an unusually
reluctant presidential candidate,'' Jeffrey Bell laments. ``For all
his weaknesses and mistakes, he was a man who deserves to be
remembered,'' writes David Frum. Forgive the invidious speculation,
but when George McGovern goes you don't think The Nation will hem
and haw like that, do you? Maybe it's just the romance of the lost
cause: If only the right hadn't come back after 1964 (the way the
left has yet to come back after 1972), then they'd be nothing to
carp about. Ah, if only ...
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of departed American icons, there are at least six
Frank Sinatra commemoratives now out, one each from  &UR; Entertainment
Weekly &LR; ,  &UR; People &LR; , &UR; Life  &LR; (best in show, hands down), Gold
Collectors Series, Fanzine International, and (ahem) Larry Flynt
Publications. Perhaps the greatest tribute to Sinatra's
pop-cultural stature is his being saluted by such an unlikely pair
as  &UR; Rolling Stone  &LR; and  &UR; The New York Review of Books  &LR; (both June
25). RS gives him a cover line, 10 pages, and billing as ``The
First Rock Star.'' The NYRB offers brief tributes from Whitney
Balliett and the late Murray Kempton. Kempton's piece originally
ran as a 1996 Newsday column and quotes Ella Fitzgerald in what may
be as close to a definition of Sinatra's genius as we'll ever get:
``Frank. Just this little guy telling this story. That's all you
have to be.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If Sinatra was narrative, then Elvis was ``tableaux.'' Some of
them are as ``vivants'' as anything in our culture (the sneer, the
Sun recordings, the opening and acoustic portions of the '68
``comeback'' special) and many of them, well, maybe even ``morts''
gives them too much credit. It'll be interesting to see if, 20
years from now, there'll be a Frank equivalent of  &UR; Elvis
International Forum  &LR; (spring). True, the quarterly's hagiographical
stance precludes anything like comprehensiveness _ never is heard a
discouraging word, like, oh, girth, pharmaceuticals, or white
cotton panties _ but where else can you find out Elvis's shoe size
(11), how much he paid for his sunglasses ($200), or what brand of
soap he used (Neutrogena)? Elvis was neither the singer nor even
actor Sinatra was; and, if only by dint of longevity, Frank led a
far more interesting life. Yet in terms of cultural impact, there's
no comparison. That Time, in its ongoing effort to co-opt the
millennium, should have made an 11th-hour substitution of Sinatra
for Elvis on its list last month of the century's 20 most important
artists, is laughable. Maybe it's just that Time Warner (which
besides being behind three of the commemoratives, owns Sinatra's
old label, Reprise) figured it owes him.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Another American icon, Michael Jordan, remains with us, happily,
and adorns the cover of  &UR; Fortune  &LR; (June 22), which asks, ``Exactly
how many billions has he pumped into the economy?'' It's a silly
question _ exactly how many? it's not as if we're talking rebounds
here _ but the answer arrived at, $10 billion since Jordan entered
the National Basketball Association in 1984, certainly has an
iconic ring to it ... Talk about icons: A full-bleed color head
shot of Lee Marvin stares out from the cover of  &UR; Sight and Sound
 &LR; (June). Bruce Willis? Sylvester Stallone? Eat your pecs out: This
was a movie tough guy. And talk about statistics: Packaged with
this issue is an engrossing pamphlet listing the 360 titles
selected by the British Film Institute (Sight and Sound's
publisher) as the best feature titles in history, accompanied by
much to-ing and fro-ing on hows and whys. The most amusing example
of the latter is Bertrand Tavernier's comment: ``Don't you think it
lacks taste to send to a film director a list of films in which
none of his are mentioned?'' ... And while pondering the
intersection of statistics, film, and taste, there's this week's
most intriguing social-science datum, from Gertrude Himmelfarb's
``Democratic Remedies for Democratic Disorders,'' in  &UR; The Public
Interest  &LR; (spring): ``Well over half of the public, but only 5
percent of leading filmmakers, say that they attend church at least
once a month.'' Maybe the figure would be higher for nonleading
filmmakers? And what about filmmakers whose publicists didn't
return phone calls? Some of these Hollywood people, getting them to
call back, it just takes (you'll forgive the expression) a miracle.

   &UR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;   &UR; Agni  &LR; (spring) has a special section in memory of Ed Hogan, the
Somerville-based publisher who died last fall. Hogan's operation,
Zephyr Press, was best known for its landmark bilingual edition of
Anna Akhmatova's poetry. Only 47, he had long since distinguished
himself, in the words of Agni's editor, Askold Melnyczuk, as ``one
of the heroes of American small press publishing.'' Hogan was a man
of dreamy implacability, almost comically dedicated to literature.
The comedy had nothing to do with him, but rather with his slightly
ethereal presence in a milieu where getting tenure or making a
reputation often matters more than advancing the cause of letters.
It was in the advancement of that cause that Ed Hogan labored, and
he did so selflessly, unstintingly, and with rare success. Robert
Fitzgerald, another Irishman who worshiped at the altar of the
word, would have recognized him as a kindred soul. The celebrated
translator of Homer and Virgil, Fitzgerald was also a gifted
teacher, as Dana Gioia makes plain in his memoir, ``Learning From
Robert Fitzgerald,'' in the 50th anniversary issue of  &UR; The Hudson
Review  &LR; (Spring). It's hard not to cherish a professor whose
grading system consisted of four abbreviations _ NAAB, NB, NTB, PB
(``B'' meant bad) _ nor a writer who notes, as Gioia does, that
surprise is ``Harvard's rarest emotion.''

</P>
<P>
   &UR; The New Yorker  &LR; (June 15) profiles a dominatrix (ho-hum), with
text by Paul Theroux and photos by (who else?) Helmut Newton. Tina
Brown became editor there, what, six years ago? Clearly, she's
still trying to whip that magazine into shape. Next thing you know
we'll find out William Shawn had a mistress and lived a double
life. Where it will end, knows God.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Barcelona is a walker's paradise, especially in spring. It has
old and new, sea and mountain, postmodern and primitive.
 &HT;    To saunter through its Gothic Quarter, along the dark, narrow
streets and past the ancient artisans' shops, is to be transported
back to the Middle Ages. Walk up Passeig de Gracia, past the chic
boutiques and the daring, whimsical buildings by Antonio Gaudi,
Barcelona's favorite architectural son, and it is easy to
appreciate why this city is known as Spain's capital of design.
 &HT;    And, of course, there is Las Ramblas, the city's most famous
thoroughfare, where people gawk for hours at performance artists,
portrait painters, parrots on sale and the parade of pedestrians.
 &HT;    This city spruced itself up considerably for the 1992 Olympic
Summer Games, a face lift that is still paying off.
 &HT;    Dozens of old factories and seedy restaurants that blocked
access to the waterfront were torn down, creating a Mediterranean
beach marvelous for strolling and sunbathing.
 &HT;    After 40 years in which Franco repressed Barcelona, the Catalan
language and the culture of the region, this proud city has
strained to make Catalan culture flourish again.
 &HT;    Scores of townspeople dance the traditional Sardana on Sunday
mornings in front of the 14th-century Cathedral. In 1995, the city
opened the Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art, a glistening white
sun-drenched building designed by the American Richard Meier.
 &HT;    And the government has put together a delightful walking tour,
the Ruta de Modernisme, to showcase Gaudi and other
turn-of-the-century architects in the Modernist school who used
themes from myth and nature to take design in a new direction.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    The Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art is staging an
exhibition through June 21 of the works of a fast-rising Majorcan
artist, Miquel Barcelo.
 &HT;    His kinetic canvases cover a vast range of subjects: Saharan
landscapes, sumptuous feasts, African flood victims, portraits of
friends and animal carcasses.
 &HT;    The museum, 1 Placa dels Angels, (34-93) 412-0810, is open
Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday noon to 8 p.m., Saturday 10
a.m. to 8 p.m.; Sunday 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Admission: $4.70,
calculated at 149 pesetas to the dollar.
 &HT;    After years of renovation, the National Museum of Catalan Art,
which served as the National Palace in the 1929 World's Fair,
recently reopened.
 &HT;    The museum, in Montjuic Park, has a spectacular collection of
12th- and 13th-century frescoes and altarpieces moved from remote
churches in the Pyrenees. (34-93) 423-7199. Open Tuesday to
Saturday 10 a.m. to 7 p.m., Thursday until 9:30 p.m., and Sunday
until 2:30 p.m.; $5.
 &HT;    One of the biggest festivals each year is the Night of Saint
John (also called Midsummer's Night), which falls on June 23. In
small towns throughout Catalonia, people build huge pyres of old
furniture and wood shavings and then jump over the embers seven
times.
 &HT;    In Barcelona, there is a fireworks display and all-night party
with music on Montjuic.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    The Gothic Quarter resembles a maze, with surprises wherever one
turns. On torrid summer days, the Cathedral's well-shaded cloister,
with its cool stone and many plants, is the perfect escape.
 &HT;    Cavelike bars, with sausages hanging from the ceiling, look like
they came straight out of a Cervantes novel.
 &HT;    The romantic should not miss two well-preserved squares: the
Placa del Pi, known for its cafes and guitar-strumming troubadors,
and the Placa de Sant Felipe Neri, an oasis of serenity with a
gentle fountain.
 &HT;    The Museum of the History of the City, housed in a 14th-century
mansion on Placa del Rei, (34-93) 315-1111, is full of wonders:
excavations of Roman ruins and a 17th-century six-story watchtower
from which guardsmen studied the sea for enemy ships. Summer hours:
Tuesday to Saturday 10 a.m. to 8 p.m., Sunday to 2 p.m. $3.30.
 &HT;    A five-minute walk from the museum is the soaring, stark Church
of Santa Maria del Mar, on Placa de Santa Maria, a 14th-century
structure with spectacular nave and columns. Unfortunately, its
ornate decorations were destroyed during the Spanish Civil War.
 &HT;    Those thirsting to see Gaudi works can buy a $10 Ruta de
Modernisme pass at the Center of Modernism, 35 Passeig de Gracia,
(34-93) 488-0139, a turn-of-the-century mansion designed by Lluis
Domenech i Montaner with breathtaking murals and a florid
stained-glass wall.
 &HT;    The pass provides admission to 10 Modernist buildings, including
Casa Batllo, 43 Passeig de Gracia, a Gaudi town house that looks
like a fairy-tale structure, and Casa Mila, 92 Passeig de Gracia, a
Gaudi apartment building famous for its undulating walls resembling
seaside cliffs, and phantom-shaped air ducts and chimneys.
 &HT;    It also includes admission to the Temple of the Sagrada Familia,
at 401 Mallorca, (34-93) 455-0247, the vast still-unfinished church
that Gaudi worked on for 43 years before his death in 1926. He is
buried in the crypt. Open daily 9 a.m. to 8 p.m.
 &HT;    Gaudi lovers should not miss Guell Park, on Calle Olot, an
unfinished work that he designed to be a model community. It has a
brilliantly colored, serpentine mosaic bench, an outdoor hall of
stately columns and two guardhouses inspired by Hansel and Gretel.
Open daily from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    Two single beds are customary in Barcelona, so those who prefer
a double bed should ask for one. Prices below do not include the 7
percent tax.
 &HT;    With many rooms facing the Cathedral, the Hotel Colon, a
charming, classical 147-room establishment, is ideally situated.
Doubles are $155. 7 Avenida de la Catedral; (34-93) 301-1404, fax
(34-93) 317-2915.
 &HT;    The elegant Duques de la Bergara, in a handsome Modernist
mansion near the Placa Catalunya, the city's main square, recently
expanded to 150 rooms when its owners bought an adjacent building.
Doubles cost $140. 11 Bergara; (34-93) 301-5151, fax (34-93)
317-3442.
 &HT;    Budget: A block from the Cathedral, the Regencia Colon is a
hospitable 55-room hotel with doubles at $97. 13 Sagristans;
(34-93) 318-9858, fax (34-93) 317-2822.
 &HT;    With doubles costing just $40, the 40-room Hotel Jardi is a
bargain, with many rooms facing the romantic Placa del Pi and Placa
Sant Josep Orio. 1 Placa Sant Josep Orio; (34-93) 301-5900, fax
(34-93) 318-3664.
 &HT;    Luxury: The Husa Palace, opened by Cesar Ritz in 1919, embodies
Old World elegance with its marble columns, stately restaurants and
well-appointed rooms. Near the fashionable Passeig de Gracia, the
161-room Palace, 668 Gran Via, (34-93) 318-4837, fax (34-93)
318-0148, charges $235 for a double room. The thick carpets,
antiques and landscapes on the walls bespeak opulence.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    For a spectacular view of the Mediterranean and equally
impressive seafood, Cal Pinxo is the place to go. Situated in
Barceloneta, an up-and-coming neighborhood originally built for
fishermen's families, this restaurant, at 124 Baluard, (34-93)
221-5028, has excellent paella, sea bass (lubina) and esquexada, a
seafood salad full of olive oil and cod. Try a bottle of Yllera, a
smooth red wine from Old Castile. Dinner for two costs about $65,
with wine.
 &HT;    A popular place for business executives and artists is Senyor
Parellada, a bright yellow room filled with plants. The restaurant,
at 37 Argenteria, (34-93) 310-5094, has excellent hake with
donostiara sauce, containing olive oil, butter and lemon, and
angler fish with burnt garlic. Dinner for two: $65, with wine.
 &HT;    Widely considered one of the best tapas bars in a city famous
for tapas, Cal Pep, 8 Placa de les Olles, (34-93) 310-7961, has
seafood galore. At night, there are often lines for the bustling
marble bar, but it is worth the wait. Try the succulent baby squid
(chiperones), the grilled shrimp, the mussels and the spinach with
garbonzo beans and garlic. Dinner for two: $60, with wine.
 &HT;    Budget-minded tourists might try Agut, 16 Gignas, (34-93)
315-1709, with an $8.50 lunch menu with entree, wine and dessert
included. At night, menus are a la carte. The vegetable pie with
tomato sauce was tasty, as were the filet of hake with Provencal
sauce and the lasagna with escalivada, a mixture of grilled
peppers, eggplant and onions. Dinner for two: $40, with wine.
 &HT;    The $6.50 lunch menu is a stunning bargain at El Convent, in a
converted medieval convent, at 3 Jerusalem, (34-93) 317-1052, just
behind the colorful Boqueria food market. One recent lunch time,
appetizers included lentil salad, baby squid salad and asparagus
with garlic mousse.

 STRONG DOLLAR DEALS  
 &HT;    A strong U.S. dollar is paying off for American travelers,
whether they're heading to Europe or Asia.
 &HT;    Tauck Tours credits the stronger dollar combined with reduced
European prices for lower rates on more than half their European
``Yellow Roads'' itineraries in 1998.
 &HT;    These trips take their name from the colored roads on European
maps which denote the less-traveled and more scenic back roads.
 &HT;    Tauck says its greatest savings are in the 14-day Romantic
Germany program, reduced by 11 percent over last year; the 12-day
Alps of Switzerland, Austria and Italy, reduced by more than 10
percent; and a 14-day Holland to Switzerland program nearly 10
percent less.
 &HT;    For example, the Germany trip is priced at $3,590 for 1998
compared to $3,990 in 1997. Prices do not include airfare. Contact
your travel agent.
 &HT;    In 1998, trips to Asia offered by Overseas Adventure Travel
(OAT) also reflect savings, in some cases as much as $800 for a
couple.
 &HT;    A 15-day Discover Thailand program which cost $3,190 last year
is priced at $2,790 this year with Nov. 18 and Dec. 5 departures
slated.
 &HT;    A Nov. 4 departure is priced at $2,590 this year compared to
$2,990 last year.
 &HT;    OAT trips, which are designed for older travelers, include
round-trip international air.
 &HT;    For a catalog, call (800) 873-5628.
 &HT;    
 SAFARI SINGLES SAVINGS  
 &HT;    The single supplement will be waived on a special Kenya Safari
offered by African Travel Inc.
 &HT;    The land price of the tour is $2,395 for a December departure,
saving $650 on the single supplement. Air is $1,795 per person from
New York.
 &HT;    The Kenya Explorer includes visits to the Jane Goodall
Chimpanzee Sanctuary, Karen Blixen Museum and a nature walk in the
Aberdares. Reservations should be made through your travel agent.

 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It's a love affair that may have started in a Paris bistro or a
cafe in Tuscany _ the love affair, that is, between an American
traveler and European wines.
 &HT;    More than one oenophile (wine lover) has been born after a
memorable trip abroad. For those enamored of the grape, there are
wine tours that show off the best of Europe's vineyards and
wineries. Here's a taste. Rates are per-person, based on double
occupancy.
 &HT;     Esperienze Italiane Travel  (c/o Felidia Ristorante, 243 East
58th St., New York, N.Y. 10022; 212-758-1488; www.lidiasitaly.com)
was founded by chef and restauranteur Lidia Bastianich, who offers
visits to leading Italian restaurants and sessions with food and
wine experts in Tuscany and Umbria.
 &HT;    These are food and art trips as much as wine trips. For example,
in Tuscany, the food writer Burton Anderson and Baron Francesco
Ricasoli of the Castello Brolio estate are guests of honor.
 &HT;    There's a cooking demonstration in Chianti, olive-oil tastings
and wine tasting with producers from Isola e Olena and Fontodi
wines. The San Lorenzo market in Florence and Michelangelo's New
Sacristy are also on the itinerary.
 &HT;    The cost of the six-night trip is $3,950 and includes
accommodation and most meals.
 &HT;     France In Your Glass  (814 35th Ave., Seattle, Wash. 98122;
800-578-0903; www.inyourglass.com) is the leading American company
for wine tours and vacations to the greatest wine-growing regions
of France. That's no easy task.
 &HT;    Unlike Napa and Sonoma Valleys in California, with their
open-door policies and tasting rooms that welcome one and all, the
great wine chateaux in France are virtually inaccessible without a
formal initiation.
 &HT;    France in Your Glass' founder and president Ronald Holden has
made his reputation by getting American wine-lovers past otherwise
locked gates. He offers the kind of access that only those in the
trade customarily have.
 &HT;    The ``Connoisseur Wine Programs'' allow guests to taste the most
prestigious wines of France in areas such as Bordeaux, Burgundy and
Champagne.
 &HT;    For example, ``Great Estates of Burgundy'' is a four-night
program that offers tours of the great Burgundian vineyards and
private visits and tasting with such ``negociants'' or shippers as
Bouchard and Leflaive and growers like Roumier, Matrot and Senard.
 &HT;    In addition, meals are at Michelin-starred restaurants and grand
cru wines are served.
 &HT;    Lodging for five nights in Beaune, daily breakfast and some
lunches and dinners are included in the $3,295 price.
 &HT;    Holden also offers weekends with wine expert Michael Broadbent,
a ``Grand Tour'' led by himself and Broadbent, culinary and food
vacations, and ```Your Way' Independent Wine Country Programs.''
 &HT;    These trips, in such regions as Alsace, Bordeaux, Burgundy,
Champagne and Provence, are for travelers who want to go along at
their own pace.
 &HT;    The price varies, but expect to pay at least $400 per person in
Burgundy or Bordeaux for up to three people for a one-day program
that includes lunch and visits with a local bilingual wine
professional.
 &HT;     The Parker Company  (319 Lynnway, Lynn, Mass. 01901;
800-280-2811; www.theparkercompany.com) calls its wine and
gastronomy tours to Italy the ``Great Wines of Italy.''
 &HT;    These are affordable three-day, three-night trips that explore
six regions of the country: Latium, Umbria, Tuscany,
Emilia-Romagna, Piedmont and Veneto.
 &HT;    Each tour costs $599 and includes three nights of lodging in
distinctive three- or four-star hotels, sommelier-guided tours,
daily buffet breakfast, lunch and dinner, admission to all wineries
and museums and motorcoach transportation.
 &HT;    Take Tuscany as an example. Guests rendezvous in the town of
Pienza at the Hotel Il Chiostro, a former 15th-century convent. The
first day, they travel to Montepulciano, visit the Redi cellars,
picnic in the Brunello vineyards, and sample the wines at the
Enoteca Regionale.
 &HT;    On day two, it's a similarly packed itinerary in Chianti, and on
day three, in Siena.
 &HT;    In between are picnics, gourmet dinners and a chance to taste
the greatest wines of the region. And the short duration of these
tours make them a good fit into any Italian vacation. It's possible
to combine consecutive three day trips as well.
 &HT;    A nine-day wine tour, for example, runs $1,595.
 &HT;    Finally, wine historians and lovers of the grape note the ``Fete
de Vignerons'' or the Wine Grower's Festival, a unique Swiss
celebration that is held but five times a century in the Lake
Geneva waterside town of Vevey.
 &HT;    More than 250,000 people are expected to attend the last ``Fete
de Vignorons'' of this century, which will be held next year, from
July 26 to Aug. 15, 1999.
 &HT;    Now, of course, is the time to book tickets and a hotel room for
what will likely be a sold-out event.
 &HT;    The festival dates back to 1819, when a banquet and village
parade were the rewards for an outstanding harvest.
 &HT;    Organized by the ``Confrerie des Vignorons,'' the fraternity of
wine growers, the festivities and parade have become increasingly
elaborate over the years.
 &HT;    In 1999, over 4,600 actors and artists will participate in the
spectacle, utilizing a new 18,000-seat arena overlooking Lake
Geneva and the French Alps.
 &HT;    For information on tickets and accommodation, contact
Switzerland Tourism, 608 Fifth Ave., New York, N.Y. 10020;
212-757-5944; www.lake-geneva-region.ch.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It's a love affair that may have started in a Paris bistro or a
cafe in Tuscany _ the love affair, that is, between an American
traveler and European wines.
 &HT;    More than one oenophile (wine lover) has been born after a
memorable trip abroad. For those enamored of the grape, there are
wine tours that show off the best of Europe's vineyards and
wineries. Here's a taste. Rates are per-person, based on double
occupancy.
 &HT;     Esperienze Italiane Travel  (c/o Felidia Ristorante, 243 East
58th St., New York, N.Y. 10022; 212-758-1488; www.lidiasitaly.com)
was founded by chef and restauranteur Lidia Bastianich, who offers
visits to leading Italian restaurants and sessions with food and
wine experts in Tuscany and Umbria.
 &HT;    These are food and art trips as much as wine trips. For example,
in Tuscany, the food writer Burton Anderson and Baron Francesco
Ricasoli of the Castello Brolio estate are guests of honor.
 &HT;    There's a cooking demonstration in Chianti, olive-oil tastings
and wine tasting with producers from Isola e Olena and Fontodi
wines. The San Lorenzo market in Florence and Michelangelo's New
Sacristy are also on the itinerary.
 &HT;    The cost of the six-night trip is $3,950 and includes
accommodation and most meals.
 &HT;     France In Your Glass  (814 35th Ave., Seattle, Wash. 98122;
800-578-0903; www.inyourglass.com) is the leading American company
for wine tours and vacations to the greatest wine-growing regions
of France. That's no easy task.
 &HT;    Unlike Napa and Sonoma Valleys in California, with their
open-door policies and tasting rooms that welcome one and all, the
great wine chateaux in France are virtually inaccessible without a
formal initiation.
 &HT;    France in Your Glass' founder and president Ronald Holden has
made his reputation by getting American wine-lovers past otherwise
locked gates. He offers the kind of access that only those in the
trade customarily have.
 &HT;    The ``Connoisseur Wine Programs'' allow guests to taste the most
prestigious wines of France in areas such as Bordeaux, Burgundy and
Champagne.
 &HT;    For example, ``Great Estates of Burgundy'' is a four-night
program that offers tours of the great Burgundian vineyards and
private visits and tasting with such ``negociants'' or shippers as
Bouchard and Leflaive and growers like Roumier, Matrot and Senard.
 &HT;    In addition, meals are at Michelin-starred restaurants and grand
cru wines are served.
 &HT;    Lodging for five nights in Beaune, daily breakfast and some
lunches and dinners are included in the $3,295 price.
 &HT;    Holden also offers weekends with wine expert Michael Broadbent,
a ``Grand Tour'' led by himself and Broadbent, culinary and food
vacations, and ```Your Way' Independent Wine Country Programs.''
 &HT;    These trips, in such regions as Alsace, Bordeaux, Burgundy,
Champagne and Provence, are for travelers who want to go along at
their own pace.
 &HT;    The price varies, but expect to pay at least $400 per person in
Burgundy or Bordeaux for up to three people for a one-day program
that includes lunch and visits with a local bilingual wine
professional.
 &HT;     The Parker Company  (319 Lynnway, Lynn, Mass. 01901;
800-280-2811; www.theparkercompany.com) calls its wine and
gastronomy tours to Italy the ``Great Wines of Italy.''
 &HT;    These are affordable three-day, three-night trips that explore
six regions of the country: Latium, Umbria, Tuscany,
Emilia-Romagna, Piedmont and Veneto.
 &HT;    Each tour costs $599 and includes three nights of lodging in
distinctive three- or four-star hotels, sommelier-guided tours,
daily buffet breakfast, lunch and dinner, admission to all wineries
and museums and motorcoach transportation.
 &HT;    Take Tuscany as an example. Guests rendezvous in the town of
Pienza at the Hotel Il Chiostro, a former 15th-century convent. The
first day, they travel to Montepulciano, visit the Redi cellars,
picnic in the Brunello vineyards, and sample the wines at the
Enoteca Regionale.
 &HT;    On day two, it's a similarly packed itinerary in Chianti, and on
day three, in Siena.
 &HT;    In between are picnics, gourmet dinners and a chance to taste
the greatest wines of the region. And the short duration of these
tours make them a good fit into any Italian vacation. It's possible
to combine consecutive three day trips as well.
 &HT;    A nine-day wine tour, for example, runs $1,595.
 &HT;    Finally, wine historians and lovers of the grape note the ``Fete
de Vignerons'' or the Wine Grower's Festival, a unique Swiss
celebration that is held but five times a century in the Lake
Geneva waterside town of Vevey.
 &HT;    More than 250,000 people are expected to attend the last ``Fete
de Vignorons'' of this century, which will be held next year, from
July 26 to Aug. 15, 1999.
 &HT;    Now, of course, is the time to book tickets and a hotel room for
what will likely be a sold-out event.
 &HT;    The festival dates back to 1819, when a banquet and village
parade were the rewards for an outstanding harvest.
 &HT;    Organized by the ``Confrerie des Vignorons,'' the fraternity of
wine growers, the festivities and parade have become increasingly
elaborate over the years.
 &HT;    In 1999, over 4,600 actors and artists will participate in the
spectacle, utilizing a new 18,000-seat arena overlooking Lake
Geneva and the French Alps.
 &HT;    For information on tickets and accommodation, contact

 MAKEUP GURU TRISH McEVOY CAN RELIEVE SOME OF THAT INSECURITY 
(For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUZANNE C. RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So I'm driving to meet this makeup guru Trish McEvoy at Neiman
Marcus last week and suddenly I'm not sure my foundation color
looks right. And in the rearview mirror, I'm noticing these ugly
black dots on my eyelids created by my still-wet mascara. Oh,
horrors.
</P>
<P>
   When I get there, her handlers take one look and decide I still
need work. ``Let's touch up your makeup before you meet Trish,''
they tell me. How embarrassing! And how outrageous: Do I really
need to wear McEvoy's makeup to meet her? When no one's looking, I
rub off some of my blush. Maybe it's too dark?
</P>
<P>
   I'm not alone: It turns out a lot of women are insecure about
their makeup. More than 250 signed up to have McEvoy look them over
at a promotional makeover fiesta. After all, she's a hot New York
makeup artist who sells her own makeup line at Neiman's and Saks
Fifth Avenue. Her celebrity clients include Sharon Stone, Brooke
Shields, and Marla Maples Trump.
</P>
<P>
   Her makeup shtick? No need to spend a lot of time digging in
your purse for your lipstick or your compact. Instead, buy one of
her ``dayplanners,'' a ring-binder-style makeup bag that holds
foundation, concealer, face powder, eye shadow, and blush all
pressed into plastic ``pages.'' ``Set up the bag chronologically,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   Then learn the proper application technique. McEvoy's known for
her precision brushes. Just ask Joan Hathaway of Framingham, who's
arrived to meet McEvoy with six of the artist's brushes in hand to
apply concealer, blush, powder, and eye shadow. ``It's an important
investment,'' she says. Indeed, brushes range from $18 to $68. Eye
shadow averages $14, lipstick $16, blush $16 to $20, and powder
$23.
</P>
<P>
   To highlight your eyes, McEvoy says you can cover your whole
eyelid with face powder. Then feel for the bone above your eye
socket. Run the brush across the bone, first as a dotted line, then
in a windshield-wiper motion, blending up.
</P>
<P>
   Your mascara? ``Wiggle it on,'' she says, concentrating on the
base of the lashes first and then fanning it out in three different
directions. And eyeliner? Forget the sticks. Use your eye shadow
and a proper brush.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, McEvoy says, use makeup to fit your lifestyle.
She says, ``If you're dressing up, your face should be dressed up.
If you're exercising, just put on concealer and sunscreen.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and my look? After ``wiggling'' on new mascara, repowdering
my nose pretty heavily, and brushing my eye-socket bone a few
times, McEvoy says I look ``just fabulous.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ufdots &LR;
</P>
<P>
   What's it like to be a model? What are agents really looking
for? How can a young girl break into such a competitive business?
</P>
<P>
   In the new book ``The Modeling Life,'' Donna Rubinstein, former
model editor for Seventeen magazine, and Jennifer Kingson Bloom, a
New York writer, answer these questions and more through interviews
with more than 50 working models, including Niki Taylor and Tyra
Banks.
</P>
<P>
   The book emphasizes the point that modeling is harder and less
glamorous than it looks. A lot of time is spent on tedious
``go-sees'' to get jobs (where a design house looks over a
potential model), getting fitted in clothes for future jobs, or
waiting for actual jobs to begin. Photo shoots can take days to
complete and sometimes start as early as 5 a.m. And after hours of
preparing hair and makeup for fashion shows, the events only last
20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Conditions can be rough too. The book quotes one model who
fainted after modeling ski clothes in California in 110-degree
heat. Another described being hosed down repeatedly with water
while modeling muddy clothes for a laundry detergent ad campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Banks complains that the endless traveling is grueling,
especially when she's alone in hotel rooms all over the world. Her
phone bill is enormous.
</P>
<P>
   The upside of modeling, of course, includes fame and fortune
(for a few), a boost in self-confidence and independence, and the
chance to travel extensively.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, Taylor advises that parental support is one of the
most important aspects of a young woman's career in modeling. She
says, ``If you're under 18, let your parents guide you through the
beginning years. No one out there cares more about you than they
do. You will find a lot of hands reaching out for you, but remember
they are strangers.''

WOMEN MAKING THEIR MARK IN SURREALISM
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE TEMIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Women weren't among Surrealism's founders. In the movement's
first manifesto, Andre Breton, the ``Pope of Surrealism,'' used a
dictionary-style definition _ ``SURREALISM, n., masc'' _ that
symbolically left women out of the picture. That was in 1924. By
1966, that picture hadn't much improved. The landmark ``Dada,
Surrealism and Their Heritage'' at the Museum of Modern Art that
year included just one work by a woman _ Meret Oppenheim's iconic
fur-lined teacup.
</P>
<P>
   It was only after Whitney Chadwick's 1985 ``Women Artists and
the Surrealist Movement,'' the first major study of the subject in
English, that the floodgates opened and women Surrealists started
to become the subject of college courses, books, and exhibitions.
By the mid-1990s, curators started assuming that the public
recognized at least vaguely that there were women in the movement,
and their shows became specialized. The Massachusetts College of
Art's 1995 ``Object Lessons: Feminine Dialogues With the Surreal''
explored the legacy the pioneers left to women artists of the
1990s. And, 30 years after that MOMA show, the Guggenheim Museum
responded with the pointedly titled ``Meret Oppenheim: Beyond the
Teacup.'' The battle, if not the war, seems to be won, and now
women Surrealists are blended into shows with their male
counterparts, as Leonora Carrington, Leonor Fini, and Dorothea
Tanning were with Ernst, de Chirico, Magritte, and other male
heavyweights in the recent ``Surrealist Prints'' show at Boston
College's McMullen Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   Now MIT's List Visual Arts Center has come up with a major
contribution to the subject, with ``Mirror Images: Women,
Surrealism and Self-Representation,'' which is at the List through
June 28 and will then travel to the Miami Art Museum and the San
Francisco Museum of Modern Art. The show, whose theme is how women
depict women, was organized by the pioneering Chadwick, along with
List director Katy Kline and former List curator Helaine Posner.
</P>
<P>
   Breton and other early Surrealists defined the movement
narrowly. The List show takes a much broader view: It might have
been a surprise to some of the contemporary artists here to be
labeled ``Surrealists.'' The show presents three generations of
women artists, 22 of them, from North and Central America, Europe
and Japan, painters, sculptors, and photographers. That such a
diverse exhibition flows so smoothly is a great credit to the
curators, who have also edited and installed it wisely, so it's a
comfortable size for the viewer.
</P>
<P>
   It opens with a stunner, Dorothy Cross's 1993 ``Virgin Shroud,''
a sculpture that you read as a tall female figure, but only on the
basis of what ``she'' wears _ a long bridal train and veil, which
cover her completely. The train is conventional silk, but the veil
is cowhide, with the teats forming a Statue of Liberty-style crown
around the figure's head. She seems en route both to the marriage
altar and to slaughter, which, the work suggests, may be the same.
Cross, a Dublin-based artist, is one of the stars of the show. Her
1994 ``Stilettos'' also comments on physicality and femininity. A
pair of high heels covered with cow teats, the nipples teasing
stand-ins for toes, ``Stilettos'' also acts as gentle homage to
Oppenheim's fur cup.
</P>
<P>
   You think of contemporary artists using odd materials, like
Cross and her cowhide. But one of the pleasures of the List show is
discovering that artists of an earlier generation were sometimes
prophetic. In ``The Flutist,'' for instance, a 1955 painting by
Spanish artist Remedios Varo, the protagonist has a face made of
inlaid mother of pearl, which gives off a sickly iridescent gleam.
</P>
<P>
   If a generalization can be made about the List show's earlier
works, it's that they're smaller in scale and more delicate in
technique than what came later. French photographer Claude Cahun's
tiny, exquisite black and white photographs from the 1920s and '30s
show the artist in various guises and poses, stuffed into an
armoire or being swallowed by aggressive vegetation. Cahun, born
Lucie Schwob, liked to construct different identities for herself.
In scale and style her works are the antithesis of the contemporary
photographs of Cindy Sherman. But in their mutual let's-pretend
intent, work by the two is similar.
</P>
<P>
   The List show puts Sherman, an artist in danger of overexposure,
into a fascinating, fresh context. Ditto for Ana Mendieta, whose
color photographs of traces left by bodies in sand or on stone are
kin to Cahun's work and even closer to that of Mendieta's
contemporary, Francesca Woodman, whose haunting little black and
white photos depict the figure in retreat. Woodman's 1975-76
photograph ``Nude in Cupboard'' bears an eerie resemblance to
Cahun's armoire self-portrait.
</P>
<P>
   Photography is the strongest medium in the show, perhaps because
people still regard it as the art form that represents the world
the most honestly. It's titillating when photography breaches that
trust, to create surreal, impossible, yet seemingly ``true''
situations. Among the most powerful of the show's photographers is
Marta Maria Perez Bravo, who offers staged shots of a woman bound
to oars, like a slave, or lifting her shirt to reveal bare breasts
protected by ``armor'' of dozens of tiny spikes, or a pregnant
woman holding a kitchen knife in front of her swollen belly. This
last is particularly provocative: Is she protecting her unborn
baby, or about to stab it?
</P>
<P>
   The painting in the show is also strong, and makes for lucid
comparisons. One corner features paintings from the 1930s until
now, by two artists of the first generation, Leonora Carrington and
Frida Kahlo, and one from the third, Lindee Climo, who all depict
themselves or other women in the company of animals. Carrington,
born in 1917, is still alive, working and making willfully weird
paintings, e.g., her 1997 ``Aardvark Groomed by Widows.'' Climo is
one of the lesser-knowns in a show that gracefully combines
household names with artists who are obscure. Her 1996 painting
``Pig With Moly Plant'' shows the partly draped lower half of a
goddess-type straddling the back of a pig, the picture painted in
the meticulous realist style so beloved by Surrealists both male
and female.
</P>
<P>
   Sculpture isn't the show's forte. Three-dimensional works by
Louise Bourgeois, Kiki Smith, and Rona Pondick don't show those
artists at their best. Unlike the works in the exhibition by these
usual suspects, those of the young Mexican artist Paula Santiago
are riveting. Santiago makes doll-sized garments of wax, rice
paper, blood, and hair, all suspended under glass. These macabre
garments are cousins to the bizarre little bee or berry-covered
dresses of Irish artist Alice Maher, which were featured in the
McMullen's show of Irish women artists last fall. They're also kin
to a photograph in the List show, the 1994 ``Dress of Peas,'' by
the contemporary Japanese artist Michiko Kon. ``Dress of Peas'' is
exactly that, a sweet little girl's dress covered in pea pods.
</P>
<P>
   No fur teacup in the show. But among the trio of Oppenheim works
is ``Pair of Gloves,'' which she made in 1985, the year she died.
It's an elegant and economical summation of some of the strategies
of Surrealism, especially its jarring juxtapositions and
transformation of the mundane. On an otherwise ordinary pair of
gray suede gloves, Oppenheim has printed and stitched the veins of
the hands. External protection, the role of the gloves, has been
thwarted: The hands themselves have been turned inside out.

CALIFORNIA'S HEADWATERS FOREST: TOO MUCH FOR AN INCOMPLETE DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BYRON SHER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ Look beyond the hype over the deal to save
the Headwaters Forest and you'll see that taxpayers may not be
getting their money's worth.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the California Legislature will decide whether to
appropriate $130 million for purchase of 7,500 acres of redwoods in
Humboldt County. With an additional $250 million in federal money,
the purchase price of these majestic trees is $380 million.
</P>
<P>
   In my view, the 7,500 acres of virgin and second-growth redwoods
are not by themselves worth $380 million. This huge expenditure is
justified only if the public can be assured that the side agreement
_ a giant string attached to the purchase, known as a ``habitat
conservation plan'' _ won't imperil the future of endangered
species on the rest of Pacific Lumber's 200,000 acres nearby.
</P>
<P>
   As it stands now, the habitat conservation plan negotiated by
Pacific Lumber and government officials would not only permit the
logging of ancient redwoods. It could also lead to extinction of
the coho salmon population in California.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the Legislature's Joint Committee on Headwaters
Forest, which I co-chair with Assemblywoman Carole Migden, D-San
Francisco, uncovered the following:
</P>
<P>
   The proposed Headwaters habitat conservation plan may not
preserve the other 12 groves of ancient redwoods owned by Pacific
Lumber. Contrary to the ``50-year protection'' allegedly locked in
for these groves, Pacific Lumber is negotiating a separate side
agreement with federal wildlife officials that would allow the
company to seek changes to the habitat plan periodically for the
purpose of logging one or more of these groves.
</P>
<P>
   The coho salmon to be affected by the Headwaters habitat plan
now amount to just 1 percent of their original numbers. In 1973,
there were 40,000 fishing jobs on the North Coast. Now there are
just 5,000. Those jobs disappeared after logging and mining
destroyed the coho salmon's habitat.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed Headwaters habitat plan, Pacific Lumber would
establish a 30-foot ``no-cut'' zone on the sides of streams to
protect spawning habitat for coho salmon. Yet two of the U.S.
Forest Service's top coho salmon experts _ geologist Leslie Reid
and hydrologist Robert Ziemer _ have asserted that the ``no-cut''
buffer zones are inadequate. The scientists noted ``significant
discrepancy'' between the protections in the Headwaters habitat
conservation plan and the two most widely accepted, scientifically
based sources, which recommend ``no-cut'' zones of 170 to 300 feet.
</P>
<P>
   To date, officials with the National Marine Fisheries Service,
the agency responsible for survival of the coho salmon, have been
unable to rationalize the inconsistency between the previously
recommended national standards of 170- to 300-foot ``no-cut'' zones
and the Headwaters plan, which requires only 30 feet.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, politics is the art of compromise. Wildlife biology,
however, is not. If we compromise the habitat of the coho salmon
for Pacific Lumber, we will be forced to do so for other private
landowners up and down the coast.
</P>
<P>
   Although the struggle for Headwaters Forest has already gone on
for more than 15 years, we must remember that extinction is
forever.
</P>
<P>
   Stepping back to rethink the Headwaters agreement will be a
prudent step. We must ensure that the Headwaters deal does what it
ought to do: Strengthen rather than weaken environmental
protection.

HOOD ENABLES BOY TO GO PLACES HE HAD TO STAY AWAY FROM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GLORIA NEGRI  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRURO, Mass. _ Joseph Souza doesn't mind when people stare at
him in his new spaceman-style hood at the supermarket, do double
takes when he wears it on busy city streets, or ask him if he's an
astronaut.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the hood has made it possible for the 12-year-old
to go places he hasn't been able to go for the last six years since
having severe allergic reactions to chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have worn a clown suit with a fish jumping out of the
hat if it meant I could come back to school,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, Joseph will wear his hood when he fulfills a dream he
thought would never come true: to graduate with 21 other
sixth-graders at Tuesday's commencement exercises in the Truro
Central School gymnasium.
</P>
<P>
   It was only last February that Joseph, thanks to the hood, was
able to return to the school he had left six years ago, back when
he was in the first grade. The school had been renovated in the
summer of 1992, and the chemicals used in the construction, in fire
retardant in the walls, and in the adhesive in the new carpeting
adversely affected him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joseph wasn't in the building two hours before his eyes became
irritated and his throat squeaked like a puppy dog's,'' recalled
Cheryl Souza, 41, Joseph's mother. ``His eyes were burning and
itching so much he had to blink all the time. The sunlight bothered
them. He started getting ear and sinus infections.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd go to school for three days and be home sick for a week.
We were desperate,'' she said. ``It depressed Joey, who is a real
little scholar, that because his eyes were so irritated, he
couldn't read or write well. One day he came home from school and
told me, `This was the worst day of my life.'''
</P>
<P>
   William and Cheryl Souza took their son to an allergist on Cape
Cod who suggested he was allergic to plants and animals. But the
medicines the doctors gave him didn't work, Cheryl Souza said. The
Souzas' other son, Jeffrey, 9, is not chemically sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   William Souza, 45, a North Truro lobsterman, couldn't even take
Joseph on his lobster boat because of the diesel fumes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the Souzas brought Joseph to Dr. Thomas LaCava, a West
Boylston specialist in environmental medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the doctor put a drop of formaldehyde under Joseph's
tongue, he showed the same reactions he had in school,'' his mother
said. ``When he increased the dosage, Joseph picked up a chair as
if to throw it. This is so contrary to his nature.''
</P>
<P>
   LaCava diagnosed Joseph's problem as ``multiple chemical
sensitivity syndrome'' to such agents as formaldehyde, chlorine,
phenol, and natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, LaCava said 10 to 30 percent of the
population has the same syndrome, with the intensity varying
according to individual tolerance. ``Most people who have it,'' he
said, ``are not aware of it. They think it's psychotic or just
don't know what to think.'' If Joseph had not been diagnosed,
LaCava said, ``he would have been described as hyperactive or taken
a bad rap.''
</P>
<P>
   The Souzas never took action against Truro Central ``because as
soon as we brought them evidence that we were right, that it was
formaldehyde, they brought in two different companies to check the
classrooms,'' Cheryl Souza said. ``Joseph's classroom was found to
be the highest in formaldehyde content. The supply room wasn't even
as high.''
</P>
<P>
   With his parents' approval, Truro Central principal Brian Davis
arranged for Joseph to be transferred into the second grade at
Provincetown Veterans Elementary School. The school had no carpets
at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first year there was fine,'' Joseph said. ``The second
year, they sprayed pesticide and it affected me, so I had to be
home-tutored for about two months. The next year, they put rugs in,
so I had to be out a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph stayed at the Provincetown school until the fifth grade,
but things got so bad that Truro Central arranged
video-conferencing for him at home. ``Joe is an incredible guy and
won the national geography bee for our school doing
tele-conferencing,'' Davis said. ``But he missed the social
interaction at school.''
</P>
<P>
   To remedy that, Joseph's parents drove him back and forth to
Truro Central twice a day, for recess outdoors and for lunch, where
the school had put filters in the cafeteria. Joseph loves
basketball and the school set up a schedule so he could attend gym.
But the gym floor was refinished every summer so he had to wait
several months to use it. Now the gym has filters.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, Davis heard by chance of a farmer who wore a hood
to protect himself from pesticides. The hood had been developed by
Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company for industrial use.
Davis contacted James R. Squadrito, a senior account representative
in the occupational health and environmental safety division of 3M.
LaCava, Joseph's doctor, thought the hood worth trying.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Joseph had his own hood and returned to school within
minutes of its arrival. His brother, Jeffrey, put a smiley face on
the calendar that day.
</P>
<P>
   White and falling loosely on the shoulders, the hood resembles
those worn in the 1995 movie ``Outbreak'' by germ-fighters tracking
a deadly virus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a miracle,'' said Joseph, who finds that his only problem
with the hood is that looking down, ``I can only see to the tip of
my nose.''
</P>
<P>
   The hood is made of Tyvek with a plastic face window. A belt
around Joseph's waist holds a filter cartridge of activated
charcoal on one side and a battery-powered motor on the other;
together they weigh 6 pounds. The hood was trimmed in the back to
accommodate his backpack.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call Joseph our canary in a coal mine,'' Cheryl Souza said,
hugging her son.
</P>
<P>
   The $600 hood, with its hoses and waist packs, is a big savings
for the school department. The computer system for the
video-conferencing Joseph was having at home was costing the school
system $6,000 a year, Davis said, compared with the $1,000 yearly
maintenance for the hood's cartridges, filters, and batteries.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the reason for the hood has been explained to them,
students at Truro Central think it's cool. Next year, Joseph will
go to Nauset Middle School in Orleans, a newer school where he will
change classrooms instead of having one homeroom as of now. Davis
said the logistics of that are being worked on.
</P>
<P>
   As for Joe Souza, the hood has changed his life. Not to mention
how it has improved the lives of his family.
</P>
<P>
   With gusto, he will rattle off the things he's been able to do
with the hood that he couldn't do before. He can return to
attending church with his parents and Sunday School at Provincetown
Methodist Church. He can go back to being a disk jockey at
Provincetown radio station WOMR, where he and his brother, Jeffrey,
have a Saturday morning DJ show. And he can go back to Boy Scout
events indoors and to meetings at homes of other scouts. (He
continues his weekly violin lessons in Wellfleet, where he breathes
with the aid of a portable oxygen tank because the hood would
obstruct his playing.)
</P>
<P>
   Even with the hood, the Souzas have to be cognizant of the
chemicals in almost everything. ``Formaldehyde is found in so many
things,'' Cheryl Souza said. ``Toothpaste has fluoride, so Joseph
brushes with baking soda. I wash my house with vinegar and baking
soda, but even with plain water it affects Joseph. I can't wash the
walls because it seems to bring out some kind of chemical and
Joseph reacts. If someone comes in wearing perfume, I have to ask
them to leave, or get Joseph out of the house.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, the Souzas won a battle with a funeral company
that wanted to locate nearby. They feared what the formaldehyde
would do to their son. ``Joseph had to go through special tests to
prove that he is very chemically sensitive,'' Cheryl Souza said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the future, the Souzas hope that a treatment will come
along to cure Joseph, but, William Souza said, ``the doctors tell
us he won't outgrow this.''
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Joseph Souza has exhibited a maturity beyond his
years. ``I've got parents who taught me always to take the good
with the bad and all those good old sayings,'' he said, doffing the
hood that has now become a part of him.  &UR;  &LR; ``They kept me in line.
They're some of the best parents there are.''

CAN MONEY STILL BUY A CONGRESSIONAL SEAT IN MASSACHUSETTS?
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The most astonishing development in Massachusetts politics so
far this election cycle is the decision by a little-known venture
capitalist, Chris Gabrieli, to write the first of what may total
several million in checks to win the open 8th Congressional
District seat.
</P>
<P>
   Not since a hard-eyed rogue capitalist named Kennedy decided 52
years ago to install his son in the Boston-Cambridge seat vacated
by James Michael Curley has a monied outsider had a crack at the
storied seat of Curley, JFK, Tip O'Neill, and, till January, Joe
Kennedy, grandson of Old Joe.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking a lot of politics here. Curley, the Purple
Shamrock, first ran for Boston's Common Council 100 years ago.
Elected mayor in '45, Curley gave up his seat, and JFK won the
free-for-all primary that began the dynasty. Young Joe K won a
similar crowded primary 12 years ago to keep the seat in the
family, so to speak. There's another Oklahoma Land Rush this
September.
</P>
<P>
   Gabrielli is opening the vault. From a townhouse on Louisburg
Square, Boston's toniest address, he's hiring far and wide, cutting
a swath through the ranks of consultants, pollsters, and
henchpersons that is breathtaking in scope.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he's paying top dollar!'' marvels a Massachusetts pol
who's already in Congress. When JFK ran, Old Joe's bankroll proved
crucial.
</P>
<P>
   As Michael Bell, a Maine professor, put it in his University of
Wyoming master's thesis on the 8th: ``Perhaps the most important
contribution that Ambassador (Joseph) Kennedy made was providing
unlimited financial resources.''
</P>
<P>
   Gabrielli stunned the rest of the 12-candidate 8th district
field with a preemptive opening television ad buy that cost him
some-thing like $315,000 for the initial week's salvo alone. And as
word spreads that he plans to continue spending like that on tube
time to establish his image, the local political world is slowly
coming to grips with the likelihood that a little-known outsider
with effectively unlimited funds is changing the game.
</P>
<P>
   This is like India developing its own A-bomb. An amateur with
assets can barge into the game and demand a seat at the table with
the pros. In the shark-infested waters of Boston politics,
astonishment gives way to consternation. We've seen wealthy
amateurs try pay-to-play before, and lose. Business successes like
Ray Shamie and Mitt Romney found out that knocking Teddy Kennedy
off was an expensive and ultimately losing proposition.
</P>
<P>
   Gabrielli's firepower attracts attention. He's collecting
supporters of the caliber of John Cullinane, computer
marketer-philanthropist; banker-turned-businessman Ron Homer; and
Dr. Elaine Kamarck of Harvard's Kennedy School.
</P>
<P>
   Gabrielli is said to be close to Vice President Al Gore and a
champion of the Democratic Leadership Council's moderate,
pro-business approach. Gabrielli has embraced the charter school
concept and seems to have leapfrogged the tired, old
``are-you-with-the-teachers-unions-or-against-them?'' litmus test
that hems in timid regular Democrats. Unlike a lot of the nouveau
riche tossed up on the beach by the technology boom and the stock
market run-up, Gabrielli is a policy wonk with an abiding interest
in the arcana of government policy.
</P>
<P>
   The other candidates tend to run as traditional liberals, the
let's-do-more-for-the-poor formula. But Gabrielli, who has
bankrolled the MassInc. thinktank, talks about underlying market
forces. Gabrielli's wife, Hilary, served as legal counsel to the
Massachusetts Legislature's taxation committee when Jim Brett, now
head of the New England Council, was its chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Brett says the Gabriellis are a brilliant couple interested in
public policy. And the 8th District gets more federal research and
development grants than any other in the country (Harvard, MIT, the
hospitals, etc.). Without taking sides in the race where he knows
everybody running, Brett says Jim Gabrielli ``would make an
absolutely brilliant congressman'' because of his background. But
it is Gabrielli's ability to write a check that makes him a serious
player. Ray Flynn, the former Boston mayor, is the current
favorite. As mayor and Vatican ambassador, Flynn's been on local TV
more than Gabrielli can ever catch up with.
</P>
<P>
   There are two others whose campaign budgets will go over $1
million each, City Councilor Tom Keane and John O'Connor. The
traditional candidates, such as Somerville Mayor Mike Capuano, an
incumbent who can probably put more workers on the street than
anyone else at this juncture, may find themselves outgunned in a TV
war where ground troops are overwhelmed by the media air attack
overhead. Still, money could not elect California gubernatorial
candidate Al Checchi, a Somerville native who dropped $40 million
on his primary loss. He pancacked bigtime. Ross Perot and Steve
Forbes found a personal fortune only gets you a seat at the table,
not a winning hand.
</P>
<P>
   Gabrielli is articulate and intelligent, well-tailored and
obviously flush with cash. But it's one thing to understand capital
flow, leveraged buyouts, and derivative trading. It's quite another
to deal with mud-pie flow, leveraged rabbit-punches, and derisive
attacks from highly motivated rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Businessmen always underestimate the pace, fury, and randomness
of politics. Not till they get those first few
creme-pie-in-the-kisser assaults can we gauge their ability to
recover, counter, and move on in the flow of the game.
</P>
<P>
   And his $300K opening bid ensures return fire from his rivals.
</P>
<P>

 McDONALDS' OWNER DEFIES FOUNDER KROC TO MERCHANDISE McVEGGIE 
(For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Did somebody say ... McVeggie?
</P>
<P>
   Further evidence of the decline of Western civilization has
surfaced in Greenwich Village, where four McDonald's outlets are
experimenting with a new menu item _ a vegetarian hamburger. Veggie
perestroika in the Evil Empire? I had to find out.
</P>
<P>
   First, some context. McDonald's has been having problems
peddling its wares in the United States. Same-store sales have been
declining, and heavily hyped new products, like the low-fat McLean
burger and the new so-called Deluxe products (Arch Deluxe and the
discontinued Fish Fillet Deluxe) have fared poorly. Last summer's
``Campaign 55,'' featuring a 55-cent Quarter Pounder, bombed. The
company's domestic operations are being handed over to some genius
from ... Pizza Hut.
</P>
<P>
   Routinely vilified by left-wing Enviro-Greens for a) despoiling
the rain forest; b) littering the world's sidewalks; c) torturing
and killing millions of cows; or d) all of the above, McDonald's
has a longstanding public relations problem with people whose idea
of a tasty meal isn't 100 percent all beef. Substitute the word
``vegetarian'' for ``nonconformist'' in the following quote from
McDonald's entrepreneur Ray Kroc, and draw your own conclusions:
``We cannot trust some people who are nonconformists,'' Kroc once
said. ``We will make conformists out of them in a hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps vice versa. Jim Lewis, who owns and operates nine
Manhattan McD's, has launched McVeggie in an experimental marketing
campaign being closely monitored by the higher-ups in Oak Brook,
Ill. Lewis says McVeggie is a natural fit with the vestigial
countercultural elements in the Village. The day he introduced the
new burger, a group from People for Ethical Treatment of Animals
even staged an impromptu pro-McDonald's demonstration outside his
flagship store. ``There were these half-naked people dressed as
vegetables dancing on the sidewalk,'' Lewis says. ``It was quite a
scene.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; if,,2 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   How's the test going? Lewis says sales lag behind traditional
hamburger products, but are above expectations. I visited three
stores at lunch time, and saw a modest number of McVeggie users.
Because the product isn't being advertised, most customers were
trying the veg-burger on a whim. Travel agent Linda Vieira
pronounced the McV a reasonable hamburger substitute, allowing that
McDonald's burgers ``aren't all that great anyway.'' Next to her,
her 10-year-old and a friend munched contentedly on a Double
Quarter Pounder and Crispy Chicken sandwich, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Amanda During, a high school senior, waxed more enthusiastic.
She had learned of the McV from a vegetarian Web site, and subwayed
down from 65th Street to see what all the fuss was about. During, a
vegetarian, plans to tell all her friends to gobble McVeggies ``so
they'll keep it on the menu.'' How does it taste? ``It's pretty
good, although the ones in London are better,'' she opined. (McD's
has successfully sold vegetarian burgers in Europe for years.)
</P>
<P>
   Ah, taste. Even Lewis concedes that taste is not the long suit
of his custom-made, soybean-based, Archer Daniels Midland ``meat
analog'' patty. Although it has more fat than the ordinary burger,
it is curiously tasteless. Lewis explains that the patty was
engineered to duplicate the tactile sensation of eating a burger,
rather than to mimic the taste. Call it the inflatable blow-up doll
of the hamburger world.
</P>
<P>
   Whither the McVeggie? At last month's annual meeting, McDonald's
Big Cheese Michael Quinlan claimed ``we are open to the idea'' of
selling a veggie burger nationwide. But McDonald's is
simultaneously testing other menu ideas, like pizza or the oversize
MBX (McDonald's Big Extra); the company is notoriously cautious
about rolling out major menu additions nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the company introduced a product with minimal
test-marketing, in response to pressure from nutrition-minded
critics, was in 1991. That was the doomed, seaweed-enhanced McLean,
discontinued in 1996. McVeggies ads on Super Bowl Sunday? Not in
this millennium, methinks.

VOLUNTEERS FLOCK TO HABITAT PROJECT IN HOUSTON 

</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Newlyweds Ken and Gretchen Kirkpatrick are about to
put their marriage to a real test by building a house together.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not even for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The Kirkpatricks are among the 6,000 volunteers who will work
next week building affordable housing for low-income families on
Habitat for Humanity's Jimmy Carter Work Project. The project began
in 1984 when Carter worked at a Habitat site in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Each year the project visits a different city, and Carter and
his wife, Rosalynn, join volunteers to help build homes and raise
awareness of the need for low-cost housing. This year, volunteers
will build 100 homes in one week in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   It will be the largest Habitat project ever conducted in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without them, we couldn't do it. It physically couldn't be
done,'' said Rev. Michael Shirl, executive director of Houston
Habitat for Humanity. Shirl added that hiring subcontractors to do
the work would add $12,000 to $15,000 to each home's cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens (during construction) is friendships are built,
relationships are built, and everyone begins to learn about each
other. Before you know it, people are having a good time, and they
walk out of it with relationships that last a long time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For the Kirkpatricks, family ties will be renewed when Gretchen
Kirkpatrick's mother, Carol Gregory, and aunt, Dixie Conner, take
time off work to help out.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it was Gregory, director of Habitat affiliates in the
Atlanta area, who persuaded Gretchen to get involved in the
project. When she called and said she would be working on the
Houston project, Kirkpatrick decided to pitch in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been the kind of person who would give a dollar
... but I've never gone out and volunteered,'' Kirkpatrick said.
</P>
<P>
   She said her mom, who has spent 13 years with Habitat, told her
to anticipate 12-hour workdays in the Houston heat and humidity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope we won't suffer any sunburn,'' Kirkpatrick said.
</P>
<P>
   The heat also concerns project planner Becky Neuhaus, who is in
charge of coordinating transportation, housing, hospitality and
food _ especially the more than 40,000 gallons of water volunteers
will drink during the week. Also lined up are air-conditioned
first-aid trailers at each site.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the goodie bags, we have tips to stay healthy during this
(heat),'' Neuhaus said.
</P>
<P>
   The project actually began about two years ago, when Milby Hart
and other volunteers canvassed inner-city areas looking for land.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inner-city development requires an inordinate amount of
work,'' said Hart, a Houston attorney who has volunteered with
Habitat for 11 years. ``It requires patience, planning and
perseverance.''
</P>
<P>
   Hart said he has cut back his hours at his practice during
recent months as the project week neared.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I wouldn't trade it for the world,'' Hart said. ``You feel
good. You feel productive. You feel valuable. You feel like you're
making a bona fide effort to improve the quality of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirkpatrick said she felt privileged to participate. ``When I
walk away, I can say, `I helped build that house, and this family
is going to have a comfortable place to live.' That, in and of
itself, is a privilege.''
</P>
<P>
   Neuhaus echoed that thought. ``It's something you don't get to
do every day. It's getting out there in the fresh air and being
with your friends. It's a really great experience.''

49ERS ASK COURT TO BLOCK LATEST ANTI-STADIUM EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LANCE WILLIAMS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The San Francisco 49ers don't want a replay of
last year's close and controversy-plagued vote on a new football
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   In a lawsuit filed Tuesday in San Francisco Superior Court, the
National Football League team asked a judge to stop anti-stadium
activists from putting the issue of a new municipal stadium on the
ballot for the second time in two years.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-stadium activists say the football team is attempting
to trample their free-speech rights and block them from exercising
their right to vote.
</P>
<P>
   But the NFL team contends that the anti-stadium Committee to
Stop the Giveaway has committed multiple violations of state
election law by ``misrepresenting the facts'' of the 1997 stadium
campaign in an anti-stadium petition now being circulated.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the activists claim the 49ers won their
razor-thin victory in the 1997 stadium vote through voter fraud.
The lawsuit denies the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Team lawyer James Parrinello said the 49ers wanted the court to
order the city not to put the new stadium measure on the November
ballot because of the legal flaws he said the petitions contained.
Parrinello said the 49ers were fed up with the anti-stadium
activists, who mounted a noisy campaign against last year's stadium
measure and have complained since then that the measure's narrow
victory was tainted by voter fraud.
</P>
<P>
   He said the petition now being distributed contains allegations
of massive voter fraud that he said had been ruled unfounded by
investigations by the California secretary of state's office and by
a judge who rejected the activists' own lawsuit challenging the
stadium vote.
</P>
<P>
   Parrinello said state election law prohibits the use of
``campaign rhetoric'' in the language of an electoral petition, but
the petition being distributed is packed with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, we're at the point where we think it's time that
people who have been yelling about violations of the law but have
not been able to prove any should be held to account,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But committee leader Barbara Meskunas said the 49ers' lawsuit
would trample the First Amendment rights of voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``What strange country do they think this is?'' Meskunas said.
``We're still entitled to circulate petitions in the state of
California, last time I checked.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Bell, who represented anti-stadium activists in their
unsuccessful voter-fraud lawsuit last year, said the city Elections
Department had approved the language in the petition.
</P>
<P>
   The Committee to Stop the Giveaway is small and under-financed.
But in the bitter 1997 referendum over whether San Francisco should
spend up to $100 million on a new football stadium, the committee
gave the 49ers and Mayor Willie Brown all they could handle.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the stadium measure passed _ by 1,500 votes.
</P>
<P>
   After the votes were cast, the committee joined with a
Washington, D.C.-based group called the Voting Integrity Project
and sued to overturn the election, contending voter fraud.
</P>
<P>
   That challenge was thrown out of court in January.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after that, the committee began preparing a new initiative
to put the stadium back on the ballot. Activist Doug Comstock
contended it was appropriate to reconsider the stadium measure
because cost estimates on the project had soared since the vote.
</P>
<P>
   He also charged that proponents didn't tell voters that a
shopping mall being built to accompany the stadium would likely
``wipe out'' the small state park at Candlestick Point.

MEXICAN TOWN UNEASY AFTER REBELS SHOT DEAD 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DUDLEY ALTHAUS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL CHARCO, Mexico _ As a small unit of army troops manned the
low mountaintop above them, Mixtec Indian residents of this
adobe-and-tile village picked through the shreds of their
schoolhouse and murmured about the recent killings of leftist
rebels here.
</P>
<P>
   Fingers poked at holes punched into classroom walls by army
bullets. Toes kicked at broken pottery, bits of clothing and
tattered sleeping mats strewn across the floor. Eyes stared at the
dried blood that marked the spots where 11 people fell dead.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican government says all those killed in the shootout
with the army were members of the leftist Popular Revolutionary
Army, known by its Spanish initials EPR.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the people who died here were peasants,'' said Francisco
Ticurcio, shaking his head and kicking at schoolbooks as he watched
his neighbors pick through the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's incident marked the worst military defeat to date for
the EPR and serves as a reminder that the shadowy and largely
ignored rebel group has continued to recruit followers in the
impoverished mountains of rural southern Mexico since first
appearing two years ago. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; According to El Charco residents, a 15-member unit of the EPR
trudged into their mountain village about 75 miles southeast of
Acapulco on Saturday morning to try to persuade the villagers to
support their cause. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Before dawn Sunday, an army patrol that had slipped into town
on foot opened fire on the rebels, as the guerrillas and dozens of
their supporters slept in El Charco's schoolrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican government says that all those killed were adult men
in guerrilla uniforms. According to the government, five people
were injured, and 21 were taken prisoner. There were no army
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Additional army troops rode into El Charco in armored vehicles
or arrived by helicopter once the shooting started. According to
villagers, the trapped rebels fought for nearly three hours.
</P>
<P>
   The government says its troops were patrolling in search of
narcotics when they stumbled upon the guerrillas. But villagers say
that soldiers have never moved through these mountains at night.
They believe the troops were tipped off by an informer.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents of the villages surrounding El Charco fled to
Ayutla de los Libres and other towns following Sunday's shootings.
Though most soldiers had been pulled out of the area soon after the
attack, many of those villages remained deserted Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The EPR first appeared in June 1996 at a rally marking the
anniversary of a massacre in which state police killed 17 unarmed
farmers about 90 miles up the coast from El Charco.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1996, the group stunned Mexico by attacking police
stations and other government offices in seven southern states.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the group has gained little notice in Mexico or
outside the country despite occasional clashes with government
troops and police here in Guerrero state and in neighboring Oaxaca
state. Dozens of suspected guerrillas have been arrested. Others
have ``disappeared'' in government custody, EPR rebels claim.
</P>
<P>
   The EPR's movement has been largely overshadowed by the mostly
Maya insurgency in southernmost Chiapas state. The Maya insurgents,
known as Zapatistas, seized the imaginations of many Mexicans and
foreigners when they staged a brief but bloody rebellion in January
1994. Although there have been few armed clashes since then, the
Zapatistas continue to define for many what armed opposition in
Mexico means today.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, officials here say, the EPR has been organizing
in many parts of Guerrero state, where opposition to the government
seems almost as old as the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The EPR's goals, however, remain somewhat undefined. Fliers
distributed at meetings with villagers in the Guerrero mountains
call for more democracy, a fairer distribution of wealth and more
social justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't certain they existed until they started making
appearances around here last year,'' said Rafael Sandoval, a young
assistant district attorney in Ayutla, a market town and county
seat about 10 miles down the mountain from El Charco.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have been trying to persuade villagers to support
them, said Sandoval, who has helped investigate guerrilla sightings
in the area since last year.
</P>
<P>
   El Charco residents said EPR units had been visiting the village
at least once a month since last August.
</P>
<P>
   As they had in past visits, the rebels took shelter at the grade
school, a small cluster of new concrete buildings flanking a
basketball court, residents said.
</P>
<P>
   And, as in the past, scores of people from surrounding villages
walked to El Charco to hear what the rebels had to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``They invited the people to join them,'' said Odilon Romero,
the left-leaning mayor of Ayutla. ``They declared themselves
against all the injustices that exist here.''
</P>
<P>
   At the assembly last Saturday, many of the guerrillas spoke the
local dialect of the Mixtec language. According to villagers, they
encouraged people to put a halt to the robberies of passenger buses
and supply trucks that take place on the roads cutting through the
mountains here. They urged people to organize and to press the
government for clean drinking water, better schools and other
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``They spoke against all the crime and the robberies, telling
parents to discourage their children from taking part in it,'' said
Florencio Morales, who lives in a village across the narrow valley
from El Charco. ``They said they wanted people to prepare in order
to help themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Before classes ended Friday, El Charco's children had been
learning to spell in the schoolhouse where the rebels were killed.
On Monday, rows of words were still written on the blackboard in a
teacher's neat hand.
</P>
<P>
   Four large areas of dried blood stained the concrete floor to
the right side of the blackboard, suggesting that some of those
killed had died where they slept.
</P>
<P>
   A large blood stain covered the wall and floor by the door,
seemingly outlining the place where someone had sat down and died.
A single bullet hole pierced the wall at about the level of a
sitting person's head. Bloody handprints marked the wall on both
sides of the bullet hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were demanding rights,'' Pedro Morales, who was raised in
the area, said of the dead rebels. ``And they died for demanding
them.''

LAWYERS WORK TO MAKE SPIRITUAL VALUES PART OF THEIR PROFESSION
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The conversations heard inside the fourth-floor library at
Suffolk University Law School are typically about torts,
intellectual property, and the art of writing legal briefs.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  But on this breezy spring afternoon the conversation was
about subjects that seemingly have little to do with law _
liberation theology, the story of Adam and Eve, the Torah.
</P>
<P>
   The point the speakers _ all attorneys _ were trying to make is
that religious and spiritual themes have a vital role in a
profession sufferring from poor morale and a dismal public image.
</P>
<P>
   Driven by this belief, about three dozen attorneys and law
students gathered last week for a conference entitled, ``Beyond the
Code of Professional Responsibility: Can Spiritual Values Be Our
Compass?''
</P>
<P>
   Religious and spiritual values, the lawyers argued, give meaning
to every aspect of personal and professional life, even in such a
seemingly secular vocation as law.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really a historic moment in the life of our local
bar,'' said David Hall, dean of Northeastern University's law
school and one of the conference's six speakers. ``To have lawyers
come together to explicitly discuss issues of spirituality is
really a significant event.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that many attorneys, according to several surveys, say
they are unhappy and unfulfilled makes the notion of a turn to
spirituality more understandable.
</P>
<P>
   ``As lawyers doing our job we should be able to be emotionally
and spiritually fulfilled,'' said Michael J. Bohnen, a corporate
attorney and a leader in the local Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
   Rita S. Pollak, a divorce attorney, said it took her many years
to realize the connections between her work and her spiritual life.
``As I came to understand my own traditions more deeply,
particularly mystical Judaism, I began to see the links,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Pollak says, she thinks ``long and hard'' about the
language she uses in court or when writing a brief because whomever
she is talking about, criminal or not, is another ``divine being.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl L. Conner, a professor at Suffolk Law School and an
organizer of the conference, said she has leaned on her Tibetan
Buddhist practices to help her deal with recalcitrant clients,
difficult judges, and belligerent opposing attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   Patience, Conner noted, is an important virtue in Tibetan
Buddhism and can come in handy in the heat of a court battle. As
the director of the law school's clinical internship program,
Conner shares her Buddhist learning with her students.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas E. Porter, a trial attorney with an interest in
mediation, spoke of the ``divine vocation of the law'' and of the
need to transform lawyers from ``warriors'' seeking to win at any
cost to ``healers'' trying to mend broken relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great spiritual tradition of apology, forgiveness, and
reconciliation is not something you hear talked about at Harvard,''
Porter said.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowleged that trying to inject spiritual values into the
legal profession is a tall order. ``I wasn't born yesterday and I'm
a realist, but I think it is worth pursuing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Paraphrasing a book written by an attorney, Hall said there are
``no particularly holy works. Everything we do is secular. Our work
becomes holy when it is done in recognition of our service to a
higher purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaped by his African-American Christian tradition and
influenced by liberation theology and its emphasis on religion as a
vehicle to alleviate oppression, Hall said that at Northeastern he
tries to promote the idea of lawyering as a calling.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get so caught up in the details of what we do, and not
in the people and the possible good to others in society, then we
will forever linger in the dungeon of professional despair and
disdain,'' Hall wrote in a paper prepared for the conference.

   BRITAIN-POUNDSBURY (Undated) _ It was not the kind of headline
that Charles, the Prince of Wales, was used to in the British
press. ``The Prince Has Got It Right,'' trumpeted The Independent.
What prompted this hearty endorsement of someone the British seldom
tire of tweaking was Poundbury, the new community springing to
daring old life. The planned town perfectly embodies the outspoken
heir to the throne's views of modern architecture as owing a debt
to the past. By Warren Hoge.
</P>
<P>
   HARLEM-SHOWHOUSE (New York) _ As every voyeur clutching a ticket
and a dream knows, designer show houses are typically celebrations
of the perfection that money can buy. So it came as a pleasant
surprise last Friday night when the Harlem United Show House opened
its wood-and-glass front door to a sound track of furious hammer
blows and furniture being dragged into position. Fastidious show
house devotees might have deemed the evening's gala party a bit
premature, but the 24 designers, their friends, clients and
well-wishers gamely put a cheery spin on the chaos around them. By
Mitchell Owens.

   HILTON-SLEEP-TIGHT (New York) _ At the Waldorf-Astoria and other
hotels in the Hilton group, special Sleep-Tight rooms have been
designed in consultation with the National Sleep Foundation. The
special Sleep Tight rooms include apparatus for soothing the
troubled soul (and diminishing that outside noise). Along with a
turbo spa (for a relaxing soak) and blackout curtains (to make it
perpetual midnight), the special rooms offer a clock that simulates
dawn, sound effects like the crash and murmur of streams and waves
and white noise or a gentle heartbeat that seeps from the Sound
Soother. By Phil Patton.
</P>
<P>
   FOUNTAIN-DESIGN (New York) _ Moths are attracted to flames;
humans to fountains. Whether they are towering plumes ingeniously
engineered to rise Excalibur-like from a becalmed lake or
monumental gushes churning through the body of some mythological
sea creature, fountains are irresistible messengers. Hope, renewal,
power, melancholy, joy _ almost any ambition or emotion, it seems,
can be served by the clever manipulation of hydraulics. At least,
that's the impression made by the exhibition ``Fountains: Splash
and Spectacle'' that opened on Tuesday at the Cooper-Hewitt
National Design Museum in Manhattan. By Julie Iovine.
</P>
<P>
   TROMPE-L`OEIL-DESIGN (Undated) _ A smile. That's the only
possible response to trompe l'oeil designs and photo images on
shower curtains, bed sheets, even end tables. The designs are
contemporary sisters to those by Piero Fornasetti, the Milanese
decorative master of trompe l'oeil. Renewed interest in his work
(which peaked in the 1950s) was apparent at the May 16th auction of
203 of his designs at Christie's in Los Angeles; the bureaus,
dinner plates, magazine racks and hand-painted bathroom fixtures
sold for record breaking prices _ sometimes five times the auction
house's estimates. Fornasetti transferred engravings that tricked
the eye and tickled the imagination. By Marianne Rohrlich.
</P>
<P>
   NY-BEDFORD-STREET (New York) _ Despite Lawrence Selman having,
as he puts it, ``one of the last of the Brooklyn accents,'' his one
wish in life is to live and die at 106 Bedford Street, in Greenwich
Village in New York. Selman lives there now, in a one-room
apartment with his dog, Happy, and his cats, Suzy and Lucky. He has
lived there for 27 years.

TEENS SPURN LUSTFUL TEMPTATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KELLY ETTENBOROUGH  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) - Faith Shepherd went to her prom with 29 of her
friends. Each one of the Mormon teens had a date, but none went as
a mushy, romantic, kissy-face (begin ital) couple. (endital).
</P>
<P>
   Lubna Ahmad, a 13-year-old Muslim, is more interested in music
and math than boys. She plans to stay focused on classes at Corona
del Sol High School in Tempe, and when she's ready to marry, she
will follow Muslim guidelines in choosing a husband, a match based
on common values, beliefs and goals, not on superficial attraction,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Josh Harris, 23, will kiss his fiancee for the first time on
Oct. 3 _ after they are pronounced husband and wife. Harris is a
Christian and national speaker on sexual purity before marriage.
</P>
<P>
   In a culture where magazine headlines preach ``Lust Lessons:
Teach Them Tonight'' and television shows depict prom-night sex as
the norm, these and other young adults are following their
religious convictions and putting off serious romantic
relationships until marriage is in the picture.
</P>
<P>
   Their beliefs are grounded in the scriptures of their faiths:
Protestant, Catholic, Muslim, Mormon, Jewish and Hindu. Sexual
purity before marriage is the standard. The teens set boundaries in
an effort to avert temptation and live up to the standard.
</P>
<P>
   These aren't stay-at-home wallflower types. Many don't limit
themselves to double dating or family activities, but they won't be
alone in a car at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   They appreciate good looks, but they are more impressed with
good character. They may not marry the first person they seriously
date, but they don't want to pursue romance and its entanglements
until they are mature enough to make a commitment.
</P>
<P>
   They're not prudes, Shepherd, 17, said and blushingly admitted
that she kissed a boy once.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someday I'll do it again,'' said the senior at Westwood High
School in Mesa. ``Now isn't the time to find my husband. It's a
time to find the qualities I want in a husband.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Phil Baniewicz, executive director of Life Teen Inc., which
involves about 50,000 Catholic teenagers in the United States, ``As
much as we see the teens being sexually involved, we're seeing the
other extreme, the positive extreme: Young people who are saying,
`I'm going to hold strong in my faith, and I'm not going to
compromise my values.'
</P>
<P>
   ``They tend to do group dating. You didn't see that a whole lot
five or 10 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Harris spoke to more than 14,000 teenagers and their
parents at his New Attitude conferences in Phoenix and other U.S.
cities. Since he was 17, he has talked to about 30,000 people about
modern-day courtship. He has also written a book, ``I Kissed Dating
Goodbye,'' in which he lays out guidelines for dating.
</P>
<P>
   His stages for developing a godly romantic relationship are
casual friendship, deeper friendship, purposeful intimacy with
integrity and engagement.
</P>
<P>
   Harris declared his intentions for marriage while he and his
fiancee were in the deeper-friendship phase. This, he said, created
less pressure than dating casually because the relationship was
more purposeful and better defined.
</P>
<P>
   The couple also are committed to wait for that first kiss, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would serve both of us, having a pure relationship and not
to be stoking the fires unnecessarily,'' Harris said. ``We are very
passionate about each other and very anxious to be able to
experience that aspect of our relationship, but it's neat working
to learn to communicate clearly. We can't fall back on the physical
side of our relationship to smooth things over.''
</P>
<P>
   The first printing of ``I Kissed Dating Goodbye'' totaled
170,000 copies, of which more than 120,000 have been sold. Harris,
a pastoral intern at Covenant Life Church in Gaithersburg, Md., has
found Christians and non-Christians who appreciate his message, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing how many teenagers out there are not into the
dating scene, and they feel something is completely wrong with
them,'' he said. ``It's like a weight is lifted off their
shoulders. There are others who are really into (dating), and the
book is kind of an annoyance.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg and Joneen Ross of Gilbert found the dating scene awkward
when they were young and wanted a better experience for their
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't do courtship,'' said Joneen, a homemaker. ``On
looking back on our dating experiences, there was nothing really
positive about that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We grew up in Christian households, and we were taught to
maintain moral purity, but there were no tools to work with,'' said
Greg, a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Ross, 18, thinks that courtship is a good idea, too. He
wants to treat girls as sisters in Christ and not pursue a serious
relationship until he's ready for marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It frees you up,'' Matthew said. ``It just comes back to
basically trusting God.''
</P>
<P>
   Meredith Mullan, a varsity cheerleader and secretary of the
student body at Dobson High School, finds that the best dates are
those who share her religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could go to church with them and you had this
understanding of belief, and you knew you weren't going to do
things that would compromise your faith,'' said Mullan, who attends
St. Timothy Catholic Community Center in Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   Rishi Popat wants to marry someone who shares his Hindu beliefs
and Indian traditions. At North High School in Phoenix, two girls
fit that description. At Trinity College in Connecticut, where he
will study to be a neurosurgeon in the fall, he hopes more girls
will be in that category.
</P>
<P>
   In his parents' era, he said, most Hindu marriages were
arranged. He doesn't expect an arranged marriage, but long-term
compatibility will be considered before any serious relationship
begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indian teens like myself date if there is the right chemistry
and not just superficial qualities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other teens see marriage as a distant future.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Farnsworth, 17, says group dating allows him to get to
know girls while doing away with date anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are with groups and with your friends, you're more up
to talking and having fun,'' said the Westwood High senior, who in
about two years will go on a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter-day Saints.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go against the standards, you're the oddball. No one
will even try anything because everyone will think they're silly.
We all push each other along and give each other the strength and
the support because we all want the same thing. It's not just the
church's decision or my parents' decision. It's my decision.'' &QL;

COUPLE FOLLOWED TRADITIONAL MUSLIM RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KELLY ETTENBOROUGH  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) - Love came after marriage for Mubeen and Farah Khan,
young professionals who live in Mesa, Ariz., and followed
traditional Muslim practices in arranging their marriage.
</P>
<P>
   She had rejected two potential suitors before they exchanged
pictures and personal resumes at the suggestion of his mother's
friend. The pair found the information interesting, and the
families, who lived in different states, arranged to meet in
October 1994.
</P>
<P>
   That first meeting was awkward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was nervous, especially when you are meeting under these
circumstances,'' Mubeen Khan said. ``It isn't a meeting to say,
`Hey, do you want to go on a date?' It's meeting with the
intentions of `am I going to marry this person?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The families clicked, and Mubeen and Farah followed up with
phone conversations. They requested a second meeting of the
families at Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family was teasing her that I had left,'' Mubeen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came in with roses and a box of chocolates,'' Frah said.
``It was like a done deal, chocolate and flowers, please.''
</P>
<P>
   As they told the story of their courtship and marriage, they
laughed and finished each other's sentences.
</P>
<P>
   There were more phone calls and more family meetings. On April
15, 1995, they were engaged. They wooed each other with letters and
flowers but still did not spend time together alone. They didn't
even see each other for a few months before the Sept. 3, 1995,
wedding.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were feelings that existed between us before we got
married, but to call that love after months and after just getting
to know each other?'' Mubeen Khan said. ``After marriage, that's
when I think we really felt responsible toward each other. We felt
the commitment was there and our love for each other started
growing.''
</P>
<P>
   It takes faith in their religion, they said, to believe
everything will work out. And, their marriage is wonderful, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Love as far as physical attraction, everyone changes looks
over time,'' Mubeen Khan said. ``To seek out the person within is
the most important thing. That's something that Islam encourages.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, he's a 25-year-old marketing representative at
Caterpillar Financial and MBA student. She's a 26-year-old staffing
manager at Robert Half International. &QL;

DAD HELPED PREPARE SON FOR MARRIAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KELLY ETTENBOROUGH  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) Randal and Erin Palmer met when he was 16 and she was
14. Both had left their hometowns to go on a church mission trip to
Atlanta, and neither was interested in dating or serious
relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Teens in the Christian group stayed in touch through letters.
Six months later, Randal and Erin were writing only each other.
From 1990 to 1993, they wrote frequently but never elevated the
relationship beyond friendship. In fact, their parents read their
letters.
</P>
<P>
   Randal's father was a confidant and helped prepare him for
marriage. After Randal turned 18, his father asked if he had met a
young woman he felt particularly drawn to. Erin was the only one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I noticed the character of her faith; how much she loved
God,'' said Randal, who lives in Arizona. ``It seemed unrealistic
at the time because she was still in Florida. Dating has so many
expectations and everything seems to be based on the outward. We
were real with one another in our letters.''
</P>
<P>
   His father arranged for her trip to Arizona in April 1993, and
they spent all their time with family. Before she returned home,
the family talked about where their hearts were.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pretty much expected that this was leading to a courtship. I
had been praying about it,'' Erin said. ``I really began noticing
that the feelings I thought were just friendship were really love,
that I loved him, that I admired and respected him.''
</P>
<P>
   Erin and her mother made the next trip to Arizona together in
September 1993. Two days after the couple's first date alone -
eating at McDonald's and seeing ``Jurassic Park'' - Randal dressed
as a knight in shining armor. With two dozen roses and a ring in
hand, he proposed in front of everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Four months before the wedding on April 30, 1994, Erin moved to
the Valley and lived with a church family. They spent most of their
time together with family, went to premarital counseling at the
church and were careful about how they spent time alone. The
honeymoon was great, they said with a grin.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are really no regrets in terms of whether we did it
right,'' said Randal, sitting close to Erin on their living room
couch, his arm around her. ``We saved ourselves for each other.
This is the way it's supposed to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The Palmers, who live in Gilbert, are youth leaders at Trinity
New Life Church in Tempe. She works as an administrative assistant
and he as a customer service manager, but they are preparing to
spend a year in Washington, D.C., where he will attend pastor's
college. &QL;

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Nearly 20 years of the career of legendary
performer Frank Sinatra will be chronicled on KCET (Channel 28) at
8 tonight when the public television station rebroadcasts an
outstanding special as part of its fund drive.
</P>
<P>
   Sinatra, considered by many the greatest entertainer of the
century, died last month, prompting KCET to make a late change in
its fund-drive schedule to insert the special, ``Frank Sinatra: The
Very Good Years.''
</P>
<P>
   The all-music ``Great Performances'' presentation, which
originally aired in March, includes 28 numbers from 13 telecasts,
mostly from the Chairman's heyday of the '60s and '70s. Included
are ``My Way,'' ``Luck Be a Lady,'' ``My Kind of Town'' and ``The
Lady Is a Tramp,'' and duets with Ella Fitzgerald and Gene Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   The two-hour show, which will be followed by ``James Taylor
Live,'' will be broadcast again at 1 a.m. It will air a third time
at 10:30 p.m. Sunday followed by ``An Evening With Harry
Belafonte.''

SO, WHAT'S A CLOCHE?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARBARA DE WITT 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Mom and Grandma used to know all about hats. They
wore them to church, luncheons, bridge parties and even swanky
cocktail soirees. And they probably had a favorite milliner (the
fancy, Italian word for hat designer).
</P>
<P>
   Although American women no longer feel obligated to wear a hat,
they're becoming the accessory of the fall fashion season. So we
knew you'd want to brush up on your hat terminology.
</P>
<P>
   BERET _ Actually, this pancake-flat hat that's supposed to be
pulled down over the forehead is a variation on the tam-o'-shanter
cap, with a small pompon in the center of the crown. It's worn by
both men and women in Europe, but in L.A. it's a girl thing, worn
by the likes of Barbra Streisand, Rosie O'Donnell and Cher.
</P>
<P>
   BOATER _ Originally intended for men on the boating scene, this
straw hat with a flat brim and crown is a springtime fave with
women. You'll know it by its sporty striped grosgrain ribbon band,
usually worn with navy and white. A good choice for a first hat.
</P>
<P>
   BOWLER _ A hard, felt hat with a domed crown and narrow brim
that was originally designed for businessmen and horsemen (when
they rode English-style) and now favored by both sexes.
</P>
<P>
   BRETON _ Ah, the hat of choice for first ladies and wanna-bes.
It's an off-the-face felt hat (sometimes worn on the back of the
head) with a slightly rolled back brim, usually worn with ladylike
suits. It can be plain or embellished with flowers and ribbons.
</P>
<P>
   BUBBLE BERET _ Think of a beret that has been stuffed with
tissue paper. Wear it at a slight tilt.
</P>
<P>
   CLOCHE _ Remember the sassy little hat Nancy Drew wore in the
original books? This popular style of the '20s and '30s fits snugly
on the head and features a deep crown with no brim. It usually has
a bow or accent.
</P>
<P>
   DERBY _ The perfect felt hat for jeans and a leather jacket or a
pinstriped pant suit, with its curvy little brim and rounded crown.
It's usually brown or black with a grosgrain ribbon trim, and can
be worn at any angle. (Very similar to a bowler.)
</P>
<P>
   DOLL _ This is a really tiny hat, sometimes just a piece of
fabric with combs attached, usually accented with a short, fluttery
veil. Doll hats were worn by cigarette girls at nightclubs in the
'30s and '40s, and they're hot again at nightclubs like Merv
Griffin's new Coconut Club.
</P>
<P>
   FEDORA _ A man-tailored classic that's going to be super hot by
fall. You'll recognize it by its high, creased crown and narrow
brim. Best with tailored pantsuits.
</P>
<P>
   GARBO _ Named for the '30s film star, the garbo is a
slouchy-soft felt design that you pull down in front for a look of
mystery.
</P>
<P>
   PICTURE _ A glamorous daytime hat with a huge brim that frames
the face. To carry it off like Sophia Loren did in the film ``Ready
to Wear,'' you'll need dark glasses and a sexy suit with a slim
skirt ... and a couple of Afghans on a leash.
</P>
<P>
   PILLBOX _ You know it best as the hat worn by Jackie Kennedy and
Doris Day, dyed to match their suits and pumps. But actually, the
round, brimless style was first seen in the '20s.
</P>
<P>
   PROFILE _ A '30s fave, noted for one side of the brim turned
down to show your stunning profile.
</P>
<P>
   ROLLER _ The name may be unfamiliar, but the close-fitting crown
and narrow, curved brim was popular with young women in the '30s
and '40s and again in the Carter administration.
</P>
<P>
   SCOTTIE _ A cutesy triangular hat (point worn in front) with a
lowered crown, and trimmed in the back with lots of frou-frou, such
as tulle and feathers. Not for shy types.

HAUTE HAT TIPS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARBARA DE WITT 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Men must take their hats off indoors, but women
do not _ unless it's a rain hat.
</P>
<P>
   _ The frillier the hat, the simpler the outfit.
</P>
<P>
   _ Felt hats can be worn year-round.
</P>
<P>
   _ Straw hats look good with floral print dresses.
</P>
<P>
   _ Most hats are made for a 22-inch-circumference head but can be
stretched a bit.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rethink smoking if you're wearing a veiled cocktail hat.
</P>
<P>
   _ Store hats in separate hat boxes on a mound of crumpled tissue
paper to protect their shape.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't buy a hat without a sweatband, as it will quickly
stretch out and blow off your head. It also will scratch your
forehead.
</P>
<P>
   _ The tag that covers the sweatband seam always goes at the back
of the head.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't let a salesperson intimidate you. Wear the hat at any
angle you like.
</P>
<P>
   _ Spray starch will freshen an old straw hat (but don't spray
the ribbon).
</P>
<P>
   _ If your felt hat gets really wet, stuff it with tissue paper,
shape it bit with your hands, and put on top of a mixing bowl for
about three days until it dries.
</P>
<P>
   _ To block a crumpled felt hat, pass it over a steaming tea
kettle for a few seconds to dampen; then reshape it, stuff with
tissue paper, and let dry.

THEME PARK COMPANY WANTS TO SEE STEADY INCLINE IN CUSTOMERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLAIRE HUGHES  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE GEORGE, N.Y. _ From a 90-foot perch atop the Giant Wheel
ride at The Great Escape and Splashwater Kingdom, you can look down
on one-fifth of the $10 million the amusement park's new owner has
sunk into the property in the last 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   It's the $2 million, 65-foot-high, 1,650-foot-long Alpine
Bobsled, which sends its cars up a traditional roller-coaster track
and then down on a free-wheeling, careening plunge along a
high-banked chute.
</P>
<P>
   The thrill ride's course mirrors what Premier Parks Inc. hopes
to do with the Great Escape's attendance: send it steadily up an
incline, then hold onto it with unexpected twists and turns.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma City-based Premier has had some experience at getting
the biggest bang for the buck it invests in entertainment
properties.
</P>
<P>
   With 32 properties, the company is the world's largest owner of
``regional theme parks'' _ which people visit for a day or less _
and has purchased 12 parks since current management took over in
1989. The $1.9 billion purchase of the Six Flags theme parks from
Time Warner Inc. in April brought its annual attendance figures to
more than 40 million, behind only Walt Disney Co., which runs
``destination theme parks'' that attract visitors for overnight
stays.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the 11 parks Premier then owned achieved growth in
attendance, revenue and operating cash flow of 17.3 percent, 21.3
percent and 59.5 percent, respectively, as compared to 1996,
according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a consolidating regional park operator which injects
new life into the parks they acquire by spending carefully on the
capital expenditure side,'' said Jill Krutick, an analyst who
follows Premier for Salomon Smith Barney in New York. ``They've had
enormous success in maximizing the value of these parks.''
</P>
<P>
   Premier has made a number of improvements at The Great Escape
since the $33 million purchase of the park in Lake George. In
addition to the Alpine Bobsled, there are five new picnic pavilions
and a group catering service, a new ice-skating revue, the
Boomerang loop roller coaster, the Lumberjack Splash, a
500,000-gallon wave pool, and Bunyan's Bucket Brigade, a five-story
treehouse tower that spouts water.
</P>
<P>
   In the world of theme parks, keeping current is the formula for
staying out front, said John Collins, a vice president at Premier
and the general manager of The Great Escape and Splashwater
Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry is very `What's new?''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The new owners intend to keep changing the park _ but not so
much that longtime fans won't recognize its roots as a family
entertainment center with attractions based on storybook themes.
There will continue to be the low-tech, horse-driven rides in
pumpkin-shaped carriages around a replica of Cinderella's castle
and peeks ``through the looking glass'' at characters from Alice in
Wonderland.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll see over time that existing areas of the park could be
redesigned,'' said Gary Story, Premier's president and chief
operating officer. ``But one area that will never be redesigned is
the Storytown portion of the park.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles R. Wood established Storytown in 1954 and added rides
and new themed sections over the years.
</P>
<P>
   As for competitors in The Great Escape's own league, Riverside
Park in Agawam, Mass., had been the closest. But the contest
between those two parks got friendlier last year, when Premier
bought the 160-acre property for $22 million.

   CIR-GAMES-E3 (Atlanta) _ Overview of major games conference in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   CIR-CONDUCTORS-COAT (Undated) _ A student at the MIT Media Lab
came up with a ``conductor's jacket'` that monitors the wearer's
breathing and other vitals, then converts them into some sort of
visual signal that can be displayed on a screen. Then she managed
to convince the head of the Boston Pops to wear it.

   CIR-ONLINE-EVENING (Undated) _ A New York evening: go on line
and order in 1) dinner, 2) a video, and 3) a bottle of wine.
Compared with doing it off line.

   CIR-MOLECULE-MUSIC (Undated) _ The music of protein molecules,
wacky chemists and other obscure but useful on-line reference
tools.
</P>
<P>
   CIR-FINANCIAL-SOFTWARE (Undated) _ Looking at financial
software. By Alice Kein.
</P>
<P>
   CIR-DEFACING-WINDOWS (Undated) _ As a child, I liked to rip off
mattress tags, the kind that threatened prosecution to anyone who
removed them. So I was excited to learn a few days ago about a
simple shareware program that allows a computer user to deface the
Windows operating system in much the same way. By Michelle
Slatalla.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HOME &LR;  (``l'' code)
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN-POUNDSBURY (Undated) _ It was not the kind of headline
that Charles, the Prince of Wales, was used to in the British
press. ``The Prince Has Got It Right,'' trumpeted The Independent.
What prompted this hearty endorsement of someone the British seldom
tire of tweaking was Poundbury, the new community springing to
daring old life. The planned town perfectly embodies the outspoken
heir to the throne's views of modern architecture as owing a debt
to the past. By Warren Hoge.
</P>
<P>
   HARLEM-SHOWHOUSE (New York) _ As every voyeur clutching a ticket
and a dream knows, designer show houses are typically celebrations
of the perfection that money can buy. So it came as a pleasant
surprise last Friday night when the Harlem United Show House opened
its wood-and-glass front door to a sound track of furious hammer
blows and furniture being dragged into position. Fastidious show
house devotees might have deemed the evening's gala party a bit
premature, but the 24 designers, their friends, clients and
well-wishers gamely put a cheery spin on the chaos around them. By
Mitchell Owens.
</P>
<P>
   HILTON-SLEEP-TIGHT (New York) _ At the Waldorf-Astoria and other
hotels in the Hilton group, special Sleep-Tight rooms have been
designed in consultation with the National Sleep Foundation. The
special Sleep Tight rooms include apparatus for soothing the
troubled soul (and diminishing that outside noise). Along with a
turbo spa (for a relaxing soak) and blackout curtains (to make it
perpetual midnight), the special rooms offer a clock that simulates
dawn, sound effects like the crash and murmur of streams and waves
and white noise or a gentle heartbeat that seeps from the Sound
Soother. By Phil Patton.
</P>
<P>
   FOUNTAIN-DESIGN (New York) _ Moths are attracted to flames;
humans to fountains. Whether they are towering plumes ingeniously
engineered to rise Excalibur-like from a becalmed lake or
monumental gushes churning through the body of some mythological
sea creature, fountains are irresistible messengers. Hope, renewal,
power, melancholy, joy _ almost any ambition or emotion, it seems,
can be served by the clever manipulation of hydraulics. At least,
that's the impression made by the exhibition ``Fountains: Splash
and Spectacle'' that opened on Tuesday at the Cooper-Hewitt
National Design Museum in Manhattan. By Julie Iovine.
</P>
<P>
   TROMPE-L`OEIL-DESIGN (Undated) _ A smile. That's the only
possible response to trompe l'oeil designs and photo images on
shower curtains, bed sheets, even end tables. The designs are
contemporary sisters to those by Piero Fornasetti, the Milanese
decorative master of trompe l'oeil. Renewed interest in his work
(which peaked in the 1950s) was apparent at the May 16th auction of
203 of his designs at Christie's in Los Angeles; the bureaus,
dinner plates, magazine racks and hand-painted bathroom fixtures
sold for record breaking prices _ sometimes five times the auction
house's estimates. Fornasetti transferred engravings that tricked
the eye and tickled the imagination. By Marianne Rohrlich.
</P>
<P>
   NY-BEDFORD-STREET (New York) _ Despite Lawrence Selman having,
as he puts it, ``one of the last of the Brooklyn accents,'' his one
wish in life is to live and die at 106 Bedford Street, in Greenwich
Village in New York. Selman lives there now, in a one-room
apartment with his dog, Happy, and his cats, Suzy and Lucky. He has
lived there for 27 years.

THE MILLINERY MAGICIAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARBARA DE WITT 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Poor Hillary. She got so much flak for her
unflattering hats on her husband's inaugural day that Tipper took
pity on her.
</P>
<P>
   The second lady didn't swap hats ... or take the boss's wife
shopping ... but the perky, fashion-forward wife of Vice President
Al Gore did share her haberdashery secret: Jo Lichtman.
</P>
<P>
   Lichtman, a Los Angeles psychologist who decided to take her own
advice about following one's dreams, is now a hat maker. More
accurately, she's a milliner's milliner.
</P>
<P>
   In her home-based studio overlooking the San Fernando Valley,
Lichtman imports Czech rabbit fur felt and Milan straw and creates
the shapes with antique wooden and papier-mache blocks from the
'20s and '30s and some actually used for Dior's New Look in the
'50s. She uses small metal tools to create the creases in the
crown, or those ``waves'' on the side of a cloche. She even makes
the silk flowers that accent many of her hats, and does her own
embroidery and beading.
</P>
<P>
   But the real secret to Lichtman's success is her ability to
analyze a client's personality and facial features, and come up
with the perfect hat.
</P>
<P>
   So, don't ask her for a frou-frou garden hat or something funky,
because she knows what's best. Her idea of a casual hat is more
like the late Princess Diana's idea of casual, which we all know
was fresh but never frisky, says Lichtman of her highest-profile
client.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, her ``royal'' clientele includes Tipper
Gore and Hillary Rodham Clinton, as well as Cher and Quincy Jones,
and the 1996 U.S. Olympic Team.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting over tea and scones in her Victorian-decorated home,
Lichtman chatted about some of her customers who appreciate what a
custom-made hat can do for one's appearance. For instance, she
confides, Cher has a small head, about 21{ inches around (the
standard hat size is 22 inches), which makes her an easy fit for
most hats. And, since she can carry off a lot of drama, Lichtman
designed a '20s-style cocktail hat, properly referred to as a doll
hat and reminiscent of those worn at a rakish angle by nightclub
cigarette girls in old movies.
</P>
<P>
   Another easy fit is the vice president's wife. ``Tipper is a
born hat model. She's got an oval face and can wear a wide range of
hat styles,'' says Lichtman.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand, Hillary has a round face and a slightly
bigger-than-average head size (22{ inches around). So, the wrong
hat can make her look very matronly, as we've seen in the press.
And while we're talking, I didn't design the hats she wore at the
beginning of the Clinton administration. My first one for her was a
black hat with cording and a molded crown, worn for a state
visit.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, the milliner suggests, women with round, full
features look best in a hat that has a flat top on a flat, straight
brim, such as a boater ... or maybe a Breton (see accompanying
glossary).
</P>
<P>
   Although she's never made a hat for U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer,
she's noticed that the politician has a square face and would look
best with a beret crown on a hat with a slight up-tilt.
</P>
<P>
   Besides flattering your face and keeping the sun at bay, a hat

   For instance, she says, Monica Lewinsky would look most
respectable for her court appearance in a simple ivory suit topped
with an elegant off-white boater. ``And it would be so lovely with
her coloring,'' she adds.

   If you thought hat tricks were only for those on the White House
hot seat, think again. Women's Wear Daily predicts the return of
hats for fall, which means we all may be trying to figure out which
suits our suits or jeans best _ a cloche or a fedora.

   The New York Times News Service will move the following
entertainment/arts articles this week for release Sunday, June 14,
1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ENTERTAINMENT &AMP; ARTS (`e' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FEATURE STORIES  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MACHO-MUSIC (Undated) _ One of the fundamental myths of rock was
that it was essentially a man's game, a macho sport that knocked a
generation of unctuous crooning mama's boys out of the batter's box
of popular culture and allowed ``real'' men to step to the
pop-music plate. Girls who sought membership in this boys' club had
better be butch. But even performers like Patti Smith and Joan
Jett, who affected male bravado, were never fully accepted into the
highest reaches of rock's pantheon. The reality behind that myth,
of course, is something quite different. By Stephen Holden. Moved.
</P>
<P>
   TALKING-ART-BOWIE (Undated) _ Talking art with David Bowie: A
musician's parallel passion. By Michael Kimmelman. (Editors: This
is the first in an occasional series of talks with people who, in
one way or another, have a special connection to art but aren't
(primarily) artists themselves: writers, musicians, scientists,
politicians, collectors.) By Michael Kimmelman. Moved.
</P>
<P>
   ARCHITECTURE-VINOLY (Undated) _ Even though Rafael Vinoly is the
most elegant architect now practicing in the United States, he
probably doesn't want to hear about it. The elegance of his work is
ascetic as well as esthetic. By Herbert Muschamp. Moved.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CANBY-SHAKESPEARE (New York) _ There probably isn't a scholar or
critic in the world who would rate ``Henry VIII'' as one of
Shakespeare's great history plays. Yet as presented by the Royal
Shakespeare Company during its recent 18-day residency at the
Brooklyn Academy of Music, ``Henry VIII'' is suddenly revealed to
be a vivid and compelling theatrical artifact. By Vincent Canby.
Moving 6-10.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MOVIES-FIRST-RUN (Undated) _ Altogether it has been a
high-profile month for First Run Features. Once again the small New
York film and video distributor is succeeding in acting a little
too big for its acquisition budget. By Peter M. Nichols. Moved.
</P>
<P>
   KEN-LOACH-MOVIES (London) _ Surprisingly, perhaps, given his
distaste for the prevailing social order, Ken Loach was never an
angry young man. Shy and soft-spoken, he was almost 30 by the time
he set off down the path that three decades later would earn him
recognition in Europe as the dean of leftist movie makers. By Alan
Riding. Moved.
</P>
<P>
   MOVIES-TWEENERS (Undated) _
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood hasn't quite given up on the tweens _the 9- to
12-year-olds _ but it is as perplexed about how to entertain them
as parents are about how to rear them. ``There's very little being
made anymore for the tweeners,'' says Terry Press, head of
marketing for Dreamworks. ``We figure they are either going to be
dragged to `Quest for Camelot' with their younger siblings or they
reach 8 and want to see `Titanic' and everything else. They've
really become a niche market.'' By Michele Willens. Moving 6-10.
</P>
<P>
   ALY-SHEEDY-MOVIES (Undated) _ To Americans, Aly Sheedy is still
the shining conscience of the Brat Pack of the 1980s, the sprightly
valentine at the center of classic films about the transition to
adulthood like ``The Breakfast Club'' and ``St. Elmo's Fire,'' the
touchstone for a million awkward adolescences. She is the farthest
thing imaginable from a middle-aged lesbian drug addict
photographer, which is what she plays in ``High Art.'' By Margy
Rochlin. Moving 6-10.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   DANCE-JACOBS-PILLOW (Undated) _ On June 23, when the nation's
oldest summer dance festival opens in tiny Becket, Mass., it will
have a new director, Ella Baff. Running Jacob's Pillow Dance
Festival is hard work, but Ms. Baff is full of ambitious visions.
By Jennifer Dunning. Moved.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POP MUSIC  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   COLTRANE-JAZZ (New York) _ It is a perfect indicator of jazz's
restricted place in American society that Ravi Coltrane _ who is
the son of John Coltrane _was nobody special as a boy growing up in
Woodland Hills, a suburb of Los Angeles, far away from the bohemian
world. By Ben Ratliff. Moved.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TV-THORNBIRDS-CHAMBERLAIN (Undated) _ Richard Chamberlain talks
about the series that captivated a country in 1983 on the eve of
its revival. By Anita Gates. Moved.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANTIQUES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ANTIQUES-WODEHOUSE (Undated) _ In 1927, when James H. Heineman
was 10, he demonstrated a bibliographic bent: he began buying first
editions of the novels of his favorite author, the British writer
P.G. Wodehouse, whose works poked fun at bumbling English
aristocrats. Over the next 60 years, Heineman continued to buy the
works of Wodehouse, amassing a collection of some 6,300 items. Next
Sunday, Heineman's entire Wodehouse collection goes on view for the
first time at Sotheby's in New York, where it will be auctioned in
150 lots on June 26. By Rita Reif. Moved.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TRAVEL (`t' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-PORTUGAL-CASTLES (Undated) _ Exploring the cobblestone
streets and medieval castles of Portugal's hilltop towns. By
Mitchel Levitas. Moved.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-PORTUGAL-EXPO (Lisbon) _ Lisbon looks to the future as
well as to its glorious maritime past with Expo '98. By Alan
Riding. Moved.
</P>
<P>
   PRACTICAL-TRAVELER (Undated) _ How can you get anywhere if you
won't fly and can't drive? Very slowly. By Betsy Wade. Moved.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-BRAZIL (Salvador, Brazil) _ Bahia makes room for a
Candomble Pantheon. By Jon Pareles. Moved.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-BRIEFS (Undated) _ Travel notes and news: U.S tour
companies venture to Iran; Denmark town celebrates 1,000 years;
Pacific Aquarium opens in Long Beach; a wetter, wilder Dollywood.
Moved.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ The Czar's burial; Tudor events in
England; the pope in St. Louis. Moved.

QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S MORALITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June 14)   (For Use By New York Times News Service Clients)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ These are difficult times for many Americans to
decide what is right and what is wrong with the actions taken by
the men and women who run our government and shape the future of
the republic.
</P>
<P>
   While love of country and faith in the future continue to
motivate those of us whose vision has not been blinded by the
cynicism that has spread across the nation in recent years, we each
must try to determine our own perspective of the strange events
that have taken place in our society and undercut Bill Clinton's
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Many individuals, basking in the prosperity of the moment and
looking to an even better tomorrow, approve Clinton's performance
in the White House despite the aura of scandal that surrounds him.
Many approve the direction taken by House Speaker Newt Gingrich,
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and congressional Republicans,
despite their refusal to reform campaign fund-raising and their
reluctance to force the big tobacco companies, which contribute
heavily to the GOP, to pay billions in taxes to strengthen
antismoking efforts among young Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The standing of the president and Congress have risen in public
opinion polls although many Americans are dissatisfied with the
performance of Congress and dismayed by the allegations about
Clinton's personal conduct.
</P>
<P>
   As for myself, I feel that if Clinton's relationship with former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky, whether sexual or otherwise,
was consentual, then it should be a matter for discussion by the
two of them and Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if the president of the United States lied to
a grand jury about the matter or if he sought to persuade others to
cover up any misdeeds, then he is guilty of a serious crime and
should pay the penalty, whether it be a reprimand by Congress or
resignation from the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, when I first read of Warren G. Harding's sexual
liaisons with Nan Britton, who bore him a daughter, I was offended.
When I learned that they had sex in a broom closet adjacent to the
Oval Office, I was repulsed by the knowledge that such conduct
could take place in the house that has been home to every president
and first lady since John and Abigail Adams.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when I covered the White House, most of my colleagues and
I suspected that John F. Kennedy was indulging in extramarital
activities when he journeyed without his wife Jacqueline to such
places as Los Angeles, Palm Springs, New York and Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   But we had no proof and, even if we had, we would not have
written about it. In those days, presidents' private lives were
usually kept private.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, in the late 1940s, I read a column in which Westbrook
Pegler alluded to the fact that Franklin D. Roosevelt's ``girl
friend'' was at his side in Warm Springs, Ga., when he died in
1945. But I rejected Pegler's report because his thinking was so
corroded by his hatred of FDR.
</P>
<P>
   A number of years later, one my close friends, Washington Post
White House correspondent Carroll Kilpatrick, told me that Jonathan
Daniels, a former aide to FDR, had suggested that they write a book
together about Roosevelt's longtime love affair with Lucy Mercer
Rutherfurd who, indeed, was in Warm Springs on that fateful April
12, 1945.
</P>
<P>
   Kilpatrick did not become involved in the project, but Daniels
published a book in which he told of Roosevelt's romance, which
began in World War I when Lucy Mercer was Eleanor Roosevelt's
secretary and ended in World War II with his death from a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to decide what moral code another individual
should follow, especially when that individual is the president.
The judgment is one that each of us must determine for ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   On the matter of the Clinton administration's relationship with
China, the issue is ethics rather than morality.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans assert that the president's policies toward Beijing,
including the transfer of missile technology, have been influenced
by contributions to the Democratic Party from wealthy Chinese.
Clinton denies the accusation, just as Gingrich denies that huge
campaign contributions from the tobacco industry are at the root of
GOP efforts to prevent heavy taxation of the big tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   For many reasons, including memories of the Tiananmen Square
massacre of hundreds of pro-democracy protesters in 1989 and
Beijing's continued violations of human rights, critics have
contended that Clinton should cancel his planned visit to China
later this month.
</P>
<P>
   He has refused and he is on solid ground in doing so. I
journeyed to China with President Ronald Reagan in 1984 and with
Vice President George Bush in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   During those visits America's presidents did not agree with all
China had done or was doing. But our leaders recognized that
Communist Party Chairman Deng Xiaoping, who masterminded government
strategy, wanted to improve relations with the noncommunist West.
</P>
<P>
   Although Deng is now dead, there is strong evidence that the
current leaders want to continue that policy.
</P>
<P>
   It should be clear to any thinking person, therefore, that
America can exercise far more influence on China's leadership
through an enlightened dialogue between leaders than through a
boycott that would take us back to the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Among today's political leaders, Clinton is the most eloquent
spokesman for the kind of world many of us seek in the 21st
century. That would make any moral or ethical misadventures all the
more difficult to defend and all the more tragic.

 &HT;    TechnoBuddy: Tips for joining ranks of the nouveau techno-chic
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Once upon a time, if you wanted to be techno-cool it
was enough to have an e-mail account and a fast computer.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays that won't get you into the club. So if the real geeks
and gurus edge away from you at work, I am here today to bring you
a message of hope. You, too, can be a geek, even if you think IRQ
once invaded Kuwait and the chips you are most familiar with come
in a bag.
</P>
<P>
   Even better, I'll show you several free ways to join the digital
elite. Once you've followed these simple steps, Bill Gates still
may not send you a Christmas card, but you'll gain new respect from
all those who wear propellers on their hats.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start at the very beginning -- that dull start-up screen
on your computer. You'll need some new wallpaper. This kind of
wallpaper doesn't come with paste. It's the background image on
your computer screen. Let's replace the dull stuff Windows uses
with one of your favorite photos.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a scanner, you can convert the photo to a digital
image yourself. If you don't have one, most photography places and
some office supply stores can do the conversion for just a few
dollars. Save the image as a bitmap file (that's a file that has a
BMP extension). Then put the image file in your Windows folder.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what to do next. Let's say you called your file
CECIL.BMP. Simply right-click on the screen, go to Display
Properties and you'll find CECIL has been added to your wallpaper
choices. Just select it and there, big as life, is a picture of you
holding that big bass you caught last year.
</P>
<P>
   Things are looking up now, but you still have a long way to go
before you're truly trendy. Now you'll need your own Web page. It
isn't enough to cruise the Web these days, you need a home on the
Web. Personal Web pages are important holding areas for all the bad
poetry you've ever written, for the photographs no one wanted to
see from your last vacation. You'll also want to put in links to
your favorite Web sites. (Be careful with the last item. You really
don't want to put in your favorite Web sites. Instead, use Web
sites that offer impossible-to-understand technical information.
The more technical the Web site, the cooler you are.)
</P>
<P>
   If you are rich and foolish, you can get space to park your Web
page from your current Internet provider. But, unless free Web
space is part of your account, you can use one of the many services
that gives Web space away.
</P>
<P>
   There are literally dozens of outfits that have these free
offers. You can ferret them out using a search engine and the
search words ``free'' and ``Web'' and ``space,'' but I'll give you
one good site right now that will give you 6 megabytes of space
free. It's Geocities, and you'll find the free offer at
http://www.geocities.com/members/.
</P>
<P>
   You could take a community college class and learn to write the
HTML code needed to create the Web page itself. But, instead, let's
go to a free site and download a program called AOL Press. It works
like a word processor and can spit out a Web page in just minutes.
Just drop in at http://www.aolpress.com/index
</P>
<P>
   .html to get your free copy.
</P>
<P>
   You're almost cool now. But there's one crowning touch. Live
chat is very trendy. You can spend hours each night telling
flattering untruths about yourself to complete strangers who, in
return, will do the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   But anyone can log on to one of the chat channels and meet
people. What you need is your very own chat room. Hey, it's the
difference between renting and owning. You'll be able to put a link
to it on the Web page we just built, and instead of meeting your
friends on some public chat channel, you can meet at your place.
</P>
<P>
   Just go to the following Web address -- http://www.parachat.com/
-- and, in just seconds, you'll get everything you need to start
your own chat service.
</P>
<P>
   That's it. You are now technically cool.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Files are essentially long pieces of hardened steel with
parallel rows of cutting teeth. They are abrading tools, used to
grind away excess material and to smooth the work surface. They are
differentiated by their shape and tooth configuration.
</P>
<P>
   Tooth configuration refers to whether a file is single-or
double-cut. Single-cut files have rows of teeth cut in one
direction only _ usually at a 65 degree angle to the centerline.
Double-cut files have teeth that crisscross at opposing angles.
Double-cut files clear material faster than the single-cut files,
but they create a rough surface that must be smoothed with the
single-cut file.
</P>
<P>
   A file will be either coarse or smooth depending upon the number
of teeth per inch and the spacing between rows of teeth. Files are
generally graded in three categories of coarseness; smooth, second
cut or medium smooth, and bastard cut, or medium coarse. Smooth
files have 60 teeth per inch, second-cut files have 36 teeth per
inch, and bastard files have 26 teeth per inch. In addition to
these grades, some manufacturers offer rough files (more coarse
than bastard cuts with about 16 teeth per inch) and dead smooth
files (very fine cut with about 100 teeth per inch).
</P>
<P>
   Files are available in different shapes. This allows them to
adapt to the work surface or change it if necessary. The most
familiar file is the flat file. It is a general purpose file that
may be either single or double cut, with the most common flat file
being the double-cut bastard file. Most flat files taper in width
and thickness longitudinally (toward the end) and they have teeth
on both surfaces and both edges.
</P>
<P>
   With certain flat files, called ``hand`` files, only the
thickness narrows; the edges remain parallel. Hand files have one
toothed edge and one ``safe,'' or blank, edge. This is useful for
working in a narrow slot where only one side should be trimmed.
</P>
<P>
   Mill files are similar to hand files in that they have one
``safe`` edge. They are always single-cut and they are used
primarily for finishing work and for draw filing. They are also
used to sharpen mill and circular saw blades and for sharpening
knives and lawn mower blades.
</P>
<P>
   Triangular files have three tapering sides. They are used to
file the surfaces of acute internal angles. Small triangular files
are also used to sharpen hand saws.
</P>
<P>
   A knife file is a type of triangular file that looks a lot like
a flat file. It has three sides, two of which are wide and taper to
a point, like a knife.
</P>
<P>
   Round files have circular cross sections. They are used to
enlarge circular-shaped holes and slots. Square files have four
sides of equal width. They are used for clearing rectangular or
square slots. Some square files have one safe side for working in
narrow quarters.
</P>
<P>
   The half-round file has one flat and one rounded side. It may be
the most useful of all the files because it can fit against either
curved or flat surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   Miniature versions of these files are available in sets. They
are called needle files. They are used for working on clocks,
instruments, locksmithing and model making.
</P>
<P>
   Rasps are similar to files. They are made of hardened steel in
the same file shapes. They are used to remove excess material from
a work surface quickly. However, they leave a very rough surface,
so they are never used for precision or finish work. The main
difference between rasps and files is the tooth configuration. Rasp
teeth are cut individually, and they look like miniature chisels
across the rasp surface.
</P>
<P>
   Rasps are designed primarily for wood, but they may also be used
for soft metals, leather and soft plastics. There are flat, half
round, and round rasps; these are usually available in bastard and
smooth cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Another type of rasp is the surform tool. Unlike the rasp or
file, the surform is made of a sheet-thin gauge steel mounted on a
rigid frame. The teeth, sharpened holes punched in the sheet metal,
make the tool look more like a cheese grater than a file. As the
tool cuts across a wood surface, the waste material passes up
through the holes and collects in the frame. It can then be dumped
out into a trash container. Surform tools are available in flat and
round shapes.
</P>
<P>
   Using and maintaining files properly will be covered next week.

</HEADLINE>
   By PHIL PATTON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At the Waldorf-Astoria and other Hilton hotels,
special Sleep-Tight Rooms have been designed in consultation with
the National Sleep Foundation. A survey of international business
travelers by Hilton and the sleep foundation in 1997 found that
outside noise and, more important, noise from neighbors were most
often cited as keeping travelers up at night.
</P>
<P>
   Hilton's Sleep-Tight Rooms include apparatus for soothing the
troubled soul (and diminishing that outside noise). Along with the
Helen of Troy Dazey Turbo Spa, the Roc Lon TLC black-out curtains
and the Biobrite Sunrise Clock for a gentle wake-up, various
devices offer the sounds of streams or ocean waves and the Sharper
Image Heart and Sound Soother provides white noise.
</P>
<P>
   Hilton is jumping on a trend. Equipment that produces white
noise _ a generic hum that eliminates irritating noises _ is being
marketed to travelers. (Doesn't the central air conditioning of
most hotels constitute white noise by itself?) Now, for those who
are most alienated from nature, digital chips offer up ocean waves
or the rain forest. Brookstone's Tranquil Moments for Travel
promises to block out stress with the sounds of the ocean and the
forest. The device's blue, rounded shape with a digital clock face
is as smooth as beach glass.
</P>
<P>
   The Relaxation Machine plays ``six of nature's most comforting
sounds.'' It promises clarity of mind through sound. The machine,
it is promised, can soothe a baby, help meditation or increase
concentration on work. But most of all it redesigns the space it
enters and, the promotional material says, ``creates instant
ambiance anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Discus shaped, lying flat or tilted up, the relaxation machine
has no visible speakers. Its design is as reassuring as the sound
of the wind through the trees. Its controls are circles and little
ovals shaped like nail polish samples. Push this one for heartbeat,
that for spring rain, mountain stream or summer night, and set the
device to fade away.
</P>
<P>
   These are new-age sounds, moving beyond white noise to beige
noise, teal noise _ pastel noise. And the devices that produce them
go out of their way to look sleek and nontechnological. The design
is intended to keep the customer from suspecting that these sounds
could be obtained just as easily from a tape or a CD.
</P>
<P>
   But nature's sounds may not be as soothing as the makers of
sound appliances would have us believe. Not long ago, I went to
sleep with the sound of a waterfall in my hotel room _ not a
digitally recorded one, but the Snoqualmie Falls in Washington
State. Its noise is as white as the foam and spray at its base, but
its meanings are not so simple.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds more sinister than soothing because, as I had learned,
this was the waterfall in David Lynch's television series ``Twin
Peaks.''
</P>
<P>
   The most natural ambient sounds, it occurs to me, can be far
less soothing than the makers of sound appliances would have us
believe. Is it stranger to hear a real waterfall in your hotel
room, or a recorded one?
</P>
<P>
   Beyond ``Songbirds at Sunrise'' or ``Dawn at Trout Lake,'' don't
some of us need ``Broadway Boogie-Woogie,'' with taxi horns and
ambulance sirens, or ``Madison Avenue Bus, 5 a.m.'' and
``Sanitation Department: Greatest Hits'' to feel at home?
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that the appeal of these machines lies not in
the sounds themselves but in the promise that travelers can control
their environment. It's not the nature in the natural sound that is
important, but its predictability. These sounds present a familiar
picture for the ear.
</P>
<P>
   Adrift in unfamiliar cities, at the mercy of airline schedule
changes, control is what travelers lose. And wanting to control
your environment, wherever you are, is only natural.

<P>
   Wearing the wrong glasses is a major cause of problems at the
computer. Yearly eye exams are a must.
</P>
<P>
   Even minor eye defects can cause problems if they are not
handled correctly. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   COMPUTER GLASSES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Occupational prescription glasses are designed for a specific
viewing angle and the exact distance between you and the computer
screen.
</P>
<P>
   Furnish measurements of the angle, distance and height of the
computer monitor, relative to the position of your eyes, as well as
a photograph or sketch of yourself at the computer, if possible. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BIFOCALS OR TRIFOCALS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you need to focus on farther distances while at the computer
screen, estimate which portion of the work is near, middle and far
to help an eye doctor allot the portion of the lens used for each
type of work.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that the portion of the lens that is used for reading
must be at exactly the right position for you to read the screen. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CONTACT LENSES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eye dryness is exacerbated by contact lenses, as well as by the
low humidity that is typical of offices. The combination commonly
leads to stinging, burning eyes.
</P>
<P>
   You can help keep your eyes moist by blinking frequently and
using artificial tears. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LENSES FOR OLDER WORKERS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you are 45 or older and need prescription lenses, Dr. Marcel
J. Sislowitz suggests three possibilities: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Contact lenses plus reading glasses worn over them for close
work.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bifocal contact lenses.
</P>
<P>
   _ Monovision lenses; one eye wears a contact lens for distance,
while the other wears a lens for near work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes practice, but people do it all the time,'' Sislowitz
said, drawing a parallel with target shooters, who learn to block
the image from one eye rather than squeezing it shut. &QL;

 By ANNE EISENBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For many people, working in front of a computer monitor means
aching eyes, blurred vision and even migraines. Eye and vision
problems are fast overtaking sore wrists and hands as one of the
most frequently reported health-related complaints among the
ever-growing numbers of people who spend time peering at a computer
screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no disagreement among experts that we're seeing more
and more computer-related vision problems,'' said Dr. Kent M. Daum,
an optometrist and professor at the University of Alabama School of
Optometry in Birmingham who has written a number of papers on
computer-related eye strain. ``The eye isn't meant to close-focus
all day. Doing so can lead to considerable problems.''
</P>
<P>
   So quickly have computer-related vision issues grown in the past
year that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the
federal Department of Labor is considering incorporating these
issues into the ergonomic guidelines that it is developing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, the standard targets people in manufacturing,''
said David Cochran, who directs the agency's work on the
guidelines. ``We're still wrestling with how to deal with offices
and computer work stations.''
</P>
<P>
   Surveys cited by the American Optometric Association, an
organization of 32,000 optometrists, indicate that 70 percent to 75
percent of computer workers have eye and vision problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``My eyes start to burn before I get far into the day,'' said
Leah Krawetz, who runs a travel agency in St. Paul, Minn. ``Right
now, they are killing me, and no wonder _ I'm working on an airline
reservation from here to Birmingham, England, to Oslo, Norway, and
back, all within a budget of $1,500 to $1,600. That's a guaranteed
recipe for eye strain.''
</P>
<P>
   Blurred vision, along with aching, stinging eyes, is one of the
most common complaints related to computer use.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some blurred vision comes about because of incorrect glasses
or contact lenses,'' Daum said. ``But that is not the only reason.
The process of reading up close requires a muscular effort. People
who challenge the muscle may have what are called spasms of
accommodation. When they look up into the distance, the mechanism
to focus is locked into place; everything seems fuzzy.''
</P>
<P>
   The fuzziness abates in about 15 minutes for a person in good
health, he said, but if someone is worn down or continues to abuse
the eyes with long periods of close work, ``the eye cannot easily
recover from the spasm or goes into involuntary spasm, a condition
that's very hard to manage,'' Daum added.
</P>
<P>
   Working in front of a computer may also induce other serious
problems. Dr. Ronald Burd, director of ophthalmology at Albert
Einstein College of Medicine-Montefiore Medical Center in the
Bronx, said that computer monitors could occasionally trigger
ocular migraines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ocular migraine is not one disease process but instead a main
highway with many roads to it,'' Burd said. ``Some people are
sensitive to red wine or blue cheese. Some small group of people
who have migraines are very sensitive to the computer. I think
perhaps the rhythmicity of the pixels in the display stimulates
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Many optometrists view computer-related vision problems as a
form of repetitive stress injury. ``Symptoms are associated with
repetitive muscular activity: frequent eye movement from documents
to screen and from screen to keyboard,'' said Dr. Jeffrey L.
Weaver, director of the Clinical Care Center for the American
Optometric Association. ``Just like other forms of RSI, the
problems take time to develop and lots of time for recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   What can computer users do to guard against vision-related
problems?
</P>
<P>
   ``Often users need a specific set of glasses for working at a
computer,'' said Dr. Marcel J. Sislowitz, a Manhattan
ophthalmologist and surgeon who draws a parallel between computer
users and musicians. ``If I give a piano player glasses suitable
for reading a book, the glasses won't work _ he'll have to lean
forward to get the score in focus. It's the same for a violin
player or a computer user. Both need prescriptions specific to the
task.''
</P>
<P>
   More than half the people in the United States wear eyeglasses
or contact lenses to correct vision, Weaver said, citing figures
compiled by the American Optometric Association. ``Conservative
estimates put the number at at least 147 million.''
</P>
<P>
   For computer-related eye problems, doctors sometimes advise a
step as simple as blinking, both for patients who wear corrective
lenses and those who do not.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Weiss, an ophthalmologist who practices at
Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York City, explained
how eye dryness played an important role in causing eyes to ache.
``People get so involved with reading material on the computer that
they don't blink regularly,'' he said. ``It's very similar to what
happens to drivers at night, when they concentrate on the road,
forget to blink and experience eyestrain. The cornea isn't
lubricated, and then they feel all sorts of sensations as the eye
tells them they have a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Weiss recommends that computer users close their eyes for breaks
and blink frequently. Those who wear contact lenses, in particular,
should use supplemental lubricants or artificial tears. ``The most
natural way to treat this is to take a break,'' he advised.
</P>
<P>
   The newer generation of glare filters may also help; earlier
ones were often accused of adding to the problem by diffusing the
images. Professor Bob Beaton, a researcher at Virginia Tech in
Blacksburg who has worked on glare filters for 15 years, said
properly designed antireflection filters improved contrast, making
the screen easier to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``Concern about eyestrain at the computer is universal,'' said
Beaton, who works on several international committees. ``People
often set brightness inappropriately, unaware that brightness and
contrast work together. Turn up the brightness, and eventually the
characters get fuzzier and lose contrast; the edges of the image
thicken with brightness. A filter helps when circuitry on the
computer can't make the screen bright enough for the contrast users
want.''
</P>
<P>
   Beaton said filters had little, if any, effect on the resolution
of the display. ``The newer models are basically as clear as glass
and do not blur or fuzz the displayed image,'' he said. ``They can
attenuate or minimize refections of a bright office or a bright
shirt. Make sure light is not cast directly on the screen from
windows, then adjust the monitor properly so that it is bright but
sharp.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking down at the monitor, typically 10 to 20 degrees below
the straight-ahead position of the head _ not up _ is also a good
practice, said Dr. James Sheedy, a clinical professor of optometry
at the University of California at Berkeley. ``And if possible,''
he added, ``make sure you're looking down at a large monitor with
high resolution. The larger the screen, the better the resolution,
given decent software.''
</P>
<P>
   Humble steps like cleaning the screen may also be in order. ``A
thumbprint from peanut butter can give off a horrendous
distortion,'' said Dr. Gary Tracy, a New York City optometrist who
once came home from work to confront just such a smudge on his home
computer. Tracy recommends even illumination in rooms where
computers are used. ``Working in the dark is hard on the eyes,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   If all else fails, a user might consider an eye test in which
conditions working with a computer are simulated. Tracy
occasionally uses such simulations in analyzing the eyesight of
people who use computers for many hours daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people's eyes are thrown off by the fuzziness of letters
in a computer display,'' he said. ``In such cases, the test gives
additional, helpful information.''
</P>
<P>
   Daum is not sure that such tests lead to better prescription
glasses or contacts. ``It's true that the computer doesn't present
as good a target as a piece of paper,'' he said. ``Black print on
white paper has a good border; computer images are less bright on
the edges and brighter in the center. However, I'm not sure it
makes enough of a difference for such a test to be useful.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, many doctors advise a pragmatic, step-by-step approach
to identify factors that may cause eye problems. ``My thinking is
that Computer users should look at the entire environment,'' said
Dr. Cosmo Salibello, an optometrist who has spent 16 years doing
research on eyestrain. ``Glare will add to eyestrain even with the
best screen resolution and character-background display, as will
eyes that are not properly in focus for the screen distance. All
the factors need to be considered.''

   The first digital cameras aimed at consumers were interesting
computer peripherals that captured pictures on a sliver of silicon
instead of film. Beyond some simple business applications that
required instant electronic publishing, like making computer
records of dented fenders, new home listings or smiling employees
of the month, the first digital cameras were no match for even a
simple point-and-shoot disposable camera.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, however, a harmonious convergence of several
different technologies and trends has significantly raised the
quality, lowered the price and broadened the creative possibilities
of consumer digital photography. As a result, digital cameras are
clicking with consumers as never before.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, a new class of digital cameras _ called megapixel
cameras because each image they capture can be made up of more than
a million picture elements, or pixels _ has emerged, with prices
between $500 and $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   While they are still far more costly than many conventional film
cameras, and twice the cost of the first generation of digital
cameras, these new megapixel cameras are the first to challenge
their film-based counterparts seriously with regard to image
quality and controls.
</P>
<P>
   There are limits, of course. Even at their best, these new
sub-$1,000 consumer cameras are no match for a decent 35-millimeter
film camera if the goal is merely to take pictures and print them
out. In fact, even a $10 disposable camera and a one-hour film lab
will produce equal or superior results, just as a typewriter is
probably a better choice than a $3,000 computer system if the only
task is typing the occasional short memo.
</P>
<P>
   But digital cameras, harnessed to a personal computer with
image-editing software and attached to a color ink-jet printer,
offer a tremendous leap over conventional film photography for some
applications. Images can be cropped, enhanced, distorted, resized,
rotated, recolored, tweaked or otherwise fancied up in ways that
only darkroom virtuosos could hope to match with conventional
photographic techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the newer digital cameras have a built-in liquid crystal
display that allows the user to see the image just captured. With
the press of a button or two, any image in the camera's memory can
be saved or deleted. There is no penalty for taking a bad shot,
other than the time it takes to erase it.
</P>
<P>
   The images can then be stored and sorted, sent around the world
instantly by electronic mail, added to letters or calendars or
greeting cards, embedded in Web pages or printed on glossy paper as
prints that are virtually indistinguishable from conventional photo
prints.
</P>
<P>
   The best of the new megapixel cameras _ which including the
Kodak DC260, the Fuji MX-700, the Olympus D-600L and the Nikon
Coolpix 900 _ offer image resolutions that until now were found
only in high-end digital cameras costing $2,500 to $15,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
   Such expensive professional digital cameras typically have more
features, like interchangeable lenses and a greater color range,
than the consumer models. They are used mainly by magazine and
newspaper photographers who need to publish in a hurry or by
photography studios that want to let customers review and order
shots while they are still in the studio. (Sports Illustrated, for
example, has not shot an inch of film at the last two Olympic
Games, relying instead on digital cameras.)
</P>
<P>
   But the new consumer cameras are just one part of the new
digital imaging picture. Prices of personal computers, image
scanners, portable storage and memory chips have also been falling
sharply, allowing consumers to assemble powerful and versatile
systems that used to be the province of graphics professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Inexpensive software for editing and manipulating digital images
is getting more sophisticated yet easier to use, and it often comes
bundled with cameras or scanners.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the images out of the camera is easier, too, which was
not the case with earlier models. There are new ways to beam
pictures to a printer via infrared links, to transfer them at high
speed from the camera's memory via a cable to a computer's hard
disk and to display them on television screens.
</P>
<P>
   A number of companies offer novel ways to publish digital
pictures on the Web or send them to Grandma as an e-mail
attachment.
</P>
<P>
   Color ink-jet printers, some costing as little as $250, now have
the ability to produce photo-quality prints on special (albeit
fairly pricey) paper.
</P>
<P>
   Film companies, which might be expected to resist the rise of
filmless cameras, have instead embraced them enthusiastically. Both
Fuji and Kodak have set up ambitious programs in film processing
centers and on the World Wide Web to help customers get started in
digital photography.
</P>
<P>
   Many photo labs now routinely ask whether you want your prints
on paper, disk or e-mail. Some, like Seattle Filmworks, will even
set up a password-protected Web page for customers and post
digitized photos there. Several companies will also print favorite
digital snapshots on items ranging from coffee mugs to mouse pads.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the age of the digital desktop darkroom is here, and
millions of computer users already have some or all of the
necessary components. The main problems, or at least the central
ones, have been the cost and quality of the digital cameras. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While the new digital cameras have been domesticated somewhat
for the consumer market, they are still primarily computer
peripherals _ and thus susceptible to all the gremlins that can
plague computers. Users must have at least basic computer skills, a
willingness to read instruction manuals and learn new software
applications, a tolerance for dealing with cables and connectors,
and the patience to figure out various file formats.
</P>
<P>
   The cameras may be ``point and shoot,'' but getting the pictures
out of the camera, at least in the beginning, can still be
frustrating. And a downside of taking pictures at such high
resolutions is that each image takes up more memory and file space,
so it takes longer to transfer to and from the computer.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the potential technical headaches, there is a certain
magic when one sees a digital image appear for the first time on
the computer screen, just as there is when a conventional
photograph begins to emerge in a tray of chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   The single most salient measure of the quality of a digital
camera is its resolution, which refers to the level of image detail
it can capture. Resolution is measured in pixels, short for picture
elements, expressed by the number of pixels both horizontally and
vertically. The more pixels, the higher the resolution.
</P>
<P>
   An early benchmark for digital cameras was so-called VGA
resolution, or 640 by 480 pixels. Multiplying the two numbers
yielded a total pixel count of 307,200. While that sounds like a
lot of dots, it is barely enough to make a decent wallet-size color
photograph.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Those same 300,000 dots scattered over a larger area, like a
5-by-7-inch photo print, result in a jagged, or ``pixelized,''
picture.
</P>
<P>
   The VGA-level cameras are just fine for grabbing small images
suitable for Web pages or e-mail attachments, for viewing on a
computer screen (which is relatively low-resolution) or for
inclusion in the family newsletter produced with desktop
publishing.
</P>
<P>
   The more pixels the camera can capture in one image, the better
the image quality. As a practical matter, the higher the pixel
count, the larger the prints that can be made.
</P>
<P>
   The new megapixel cameras, using larger image-capturing chips,
can capture more than a million pixels per image (hence the term
megapixel, like megabyte for a million bytes). At these levels, the
print size can be increased to 4 by 6 without succumbing to the
jaggies.
</P>
<P>
   Even amateur photographers are now able to produce
photo-quality, 5-by-7 glossy color prints at home, using relatively
common gear. (Kodak asserts that its new 1.6-megapixel camera can
yield acceptable 8-by-10 prints, but other manufacturers make more
conservative claims.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Until the megapixel cameras came out, there was a high
incidence of returns or dissatisfied customers _ not at our store,
of course,'' said Jeff Miller, sales director at Capitol Camera in
Austin, Texas, referring to the early VGA-level cameras. If
customers bought a VGA-level camera with the expectation that it
would be a digital-age Polaroid, they were often disappointed, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, 1.2 million of the cameras were sold in North America
last year, said Jonathan Pepper, publisher of Digital Focus, a
digital-imaging newsletter. Some 1.6 million digital cameras
costing less than $1,500 each will be sold in 1998, he projected,
with that number doubling, to 3.2 million, in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for the VGA cameras have fallen 35 percent in the past
year, and megapixel cameras are sure to follow. Olympus broke the
megapixel price barrier last year with the impressive D-600L; at
$1,299, it was only half the cost of previous megapixel models.
Olympus recently cut the price of the D-600L to $999.
</P>
<P>
   Angele Boyd, vice president of peripherals research at IDC, a
market research company in Framingham, Mass., said consumer digital
photography was not very likely to become a mainstream phenomenon
until megapixel camera prices fell below $300. Some models are now
getting close to $500.
</P>
<P>
   But price is not the only consideration. Each of the new
megapixel models has a unique strength or two. The Nikon Coolpix
900, for example, uses high-quality Nikkor glass lenses, with
optional wide-angle and fish-eye lenses. The pocket-size Fuji
MX-700 has a snazzy aluminum case and a brilliant two-inch LCD
screen for previewing images.
</P>
<P>
   The new Kodak D260 has a zoom lens (3X optical, the equivalent
of a 38-115 millimeter, and 6X digital telephoto, 230 millimeter
equivalent); manual focus options; a ``burst mode'' for rapid-fire
picture-taking; a time-lapse setting, and a synchronized flash and
a microphone that lets the user annotate each image with a spoken
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The D260 is also the first consumer digital camera to have a
Universal Serial Bus connection, which means that it can blast a
megapixel file to a U.S.B.-enabled computer (standard on many new
PCs) in just a few seconds.
</P>
<P>
   On the printer side, Hewlett-Packard, which makes a line of
Photosmart printers and scanners for digital-photography
enthusiasts, has hinted that it will introduce USB-ready
peripherals this fall, enabling users to send pictures directly
from the camera or scanner to the printer, bypassing the PC.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard has also developed new inks and printing
processes for the Photosmart line that minimize fading in photos
from ink-jet printers. In the past, homemade photos tended to fade
quickly, especially if left in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Today, they are expected to have life spans similar to those of
conventional photographic prints, although leaving them in the sun
is still a bad idea.
</P>
<P>
   At the rate the new cameras are falling in price and climbing in
features, potential buyers are faced with the same dilemma they
face with PCs: do you buy today, knowing prices will inevitably
fall as soon as the plastic is back in the wallet, or do you wait
until the holiday season, when new, improved models _ perhaps
approaching two megapixels _ are certain to crack the $1,000
barrier?
</P>
<P>
   ``These new cameras today will be entry-level products a year
from now,'' said Carl Holec, senior imaging products analyst at
Associated Research Services in Irving, Texas, supporting the
buy-later view. ``But,'' he said, taking the buy-now side, ``the
ones today are light-years ahead of ones a year ago.'' &QL;

AT THE CHEMICAL COMICS SITE, COMIC BOOKS REVEAL THEIR SCIENTIFIC
SIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ky.)   (af)  
 By PAMELA Li CALZI O'CONNELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   The class nerd memorized it. The chemistry teacher knelt before
it. And you _ you kind of liked the colors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'' is the Periodic Table of Elements, that ubiquitous
classroom wall chart. The table has found a welcome home on the
Web, where it exists in numerous clickable incarnations. These
range from straightforward to weirdly inspired sites involving
comic books and poetry that even the science-averse can enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleyev is credited with being the
first to definitively chart the natural order among elements, the
basic units of matter.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1860s, he began pinning cards representing the known
elements on his laboratory wall. The grouping into rows and columns
represented shared chemical properties, or periods. In a scientific
triumph, gaps in his table accurately predicted elements yet to be
discovered.
</P>
<P>
   The power of hypertext has made the table accessible and
understandable in ways that Mendeleyev would appreciate. Indeed,
the number and variety of sites devoted to the table suggest that
it has become something of an online fetish for some chemists and
wannabes.
</P>
<P>
   Two excellent Web versions of the table can be found at the
Pictorial Periodic Table
(chemlab.pc.maricopa.edu/periodic/periodic.html) and WebElements
(www.shef.ac.uk/chem/web-elements/). Both provide an enormous
amount of information about each element, easy searching and
options for printing.
</P>
<P>
   For children, the Chem4kids site
(www.chem4kids.com/elements/index.html) is a fine introduction,
while the University of Kentucky's chemistry department invites
know-it-alls to have a go at a table that is blank
(www.chem.uky.edu/misc/periodicquiz.html).
</P>
<P>
   But Periodic Table sites are not limited to the merely useful.
One such effort is Chemical Comics
(www.uky.edu/holler/periodic/periodic.html), a labor of love by two
University of Kentucky chemistry professors, John Selegue and F.
James Holler, who share a belief that comic books spurred them to
become chemists.
</P>
<P>
   A visitor can click on an element to see a comic strip panel
featuring that element, such as this excerpt from a 1967
``Metamorpho'': ``My stinger injects a chemical cocktail of the
world's most potent elemental poisons, from lead to arsenic to
chlorine, krypton, selenium and strontium!''
</P>
<P>
   Selegue said that using the table to organize the site was a
no-brainer: ``It's the chemist's alphabet. It's our icon.''
</P>
<P>
   But if you have a favorite element and a literary bent, the
Periodic Table of Poetry (n2o.com/elemental/) awaits _ emulsion
recollected in tranquillity. So far, about one-third of the
elements boast hyperlinked poems penned by a variety of
chemist-poets.
</P>
<P>
   In a few cases, you'll need to understand a bit about the
element to ``get'' the poem, but most of the verses are accessible.
Some are wildly creative. Take these opening lines from an ode to
cobalt: ``the blue-ing of memory like adding fixative to the
photo's bath can be in the form of silvery metal, bluish tint,
refined electrolytically. Now memories appear haphazardly and it's
impossible to romanticize anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere, Mendeleyev is scratching his head.

   ``Respiration fine,'' a concerned technician said as he peered
into his monitor. ``Heartbeat is flaky, but it's there.''
</P>
<P>
   An emergency room scene? No. It was an hour before show time and
the debut of the ``conductor's jacket,'' a piece of cyberclothing
that keeps track of a director's vital signs while he leads an
orchestra. The subject, with sensors and wires hanging off him like
tin-foil tentacles, was Keith Lockhart, director of the Boston Pops
orchestra, who was surrounded by a dozen academics from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the concert, in addition to his respiration and heart
rate, the flashy red-and-silver jumpsuit recorded the movements of
his arms, neck and torso, as well as muscle tension and skin
conductivity (determined by both how much he sweats and whether he
is startled, say, by an ill-timed cymbal crash.) The computers also
flashed his vital signs onto a screen suspended from the pipe
organ.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to collect data that might explain how Lockhart's
rhythm, timing, natural gestures and even emotion become music. The
jacket's creator, a graduate student named Teresa Marrin, studied
violin and conducting as an undergraduate and became concerned that
``classical performing arts are not going to survive the
millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The violin is a beautiful tool, a beautiful transducing of our
expressive intentions,'' she said. ``But I really felt that in
order to keep ourselves as human beings engaged in this process of
creating art that we'd need to have tools that make more sense in a
modern context.'' Thus she is involved in the lab's creation of
``hyperinstruments.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the showman conductor, who donned jogging
shorts for his latest CD cover, was not impressed by the original
plain, white design that could be discreetly worn under his Armani
tuxedo. He asked that it be a little more fashionable, and beamed
as he took the stage for Tech Night _ the MIT alumni concert _ in
what he called his Buck Rogers suit.
</P>
<P>
   To add to the spectacle, a computer program translated his
body's signals into a dance of colorful, swirling geometric shapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a problem these days anyway that music, being a primarily
aural medium in an extremely visual society, often suffers,''
Lockhart said. ``Most of the general public finds the frontiers of
science perhaps more interesting than they find the frontiers of
the artistic experience'' of a classical concert.
</P>
<P>
   The thumping tribute to John Philip Sousa did little to jump
start Lockhart's flat-lining EKG (a result of a glitch in the
computer, not his heart). But by the end of the ``Sound of Music''
medley, anyone would have thought Rodgers and Hammerstein had
intended the accompaniment of the psychedelic orbs and cubes
dancing overhead.
</P>
<P>
   As for the audience? David Freedman, class of '48, said that he
wouldn't call it art and that it was definitely different from the
stuff he learned in college. ``We didn't even have transistors,''
he said.

FOUNTAIN FANTASIES, FROM CASCADES TO CURBS

 (ATTN: Texas, Conn.)  (lb) 
 By JULIE V. IOVINE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

   NEW YORK _ Moths are attracted to flames; humans to fountains.
Whether they are towering plumes ingeniously engineered to rise
Excalibur-like from a becalmed lake, or monumental gushes churning
through some mythological deity, fountains are irresistible
messengers.
</P>
<P>
   Hope, renewal, power, melancholy, joy _ almost any ambition or
emotion, it seems, can be served by the clever manipulation of
hydraulics. At least, that's the impression made by the exhibition
``Fountains: Splash and Spectacle'' that opened on Tuesday at the
Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The early role of fountains _ fueling and refreshing humans and
livestock _ quickly took on metaphorical, even propagandistic
functions. What better way to awe courtiers than with the Apollo
fountain at Versailles, where the chariot-borne sun god, his
stallions spewing, charges out of a deep pool heading east toward
the palace of Louis XIV rather than west?
</P>
<P>
   The Cooper-Hewitt show begins with the golden age of fountains
in the Renaissance and Baroque ages, when the spectacular
waterworks of the Villa d'Este in Tivoli were turned on and the
great fountains of Rome were designed by the best sculptors of the
day.
</P>
<P>
   The show ends in the present, with the waterfall memorial
dedicated last year to Franklin Delano Roosevelt in Washington. But
rather than present them chronologically, Marilyn Symmes, the
exhibition's curator, has arranged the show's approximately 250
photographs, drawings and videos into themes that address fountains
as commemoration, as propaganda, as entertainment and as spectacle.
There is even a section on the history of hydraulics.
</P>
<P>
   Fountain design has tended to go in opposite directions: the
architecturally pompous and the seemingly naturalistic. The Trevi
Fountain of Rome by Nicola Salvi, finished in 1762, epitomizes
both. It seamlessly merges, Ms. Symmes said, ``the organic and
constructed worlds of stone.''
</P>
<P>
   Out of the symmetrical arches, columns and pediments (which
compose the architectural facade) burst forth stupendous travertine
boulders _ each one carved by Salvi to look as if it were pried
from some hoary, wet cavern. The Trevi was already a tourist
attraction in 1773, as seen in Giovaninni Battista Piranesi's
etchings. (One is included in the exhibition, along with original
sketches for the fountain by Salvi.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It all comes down to magic,'' said Thelma Seear, the founder
of the Fountain Society of London, whose group made a pilgrimage to
New York to see the exhibition. ``Fountains are the magic that
binds the world together,'' she said. ``Of course, they have to
work to do the magic. That's why it's so fascinating that there's a
lot about hydraulics in the show.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one of the points of the show is that short water
supplies have never discouraged the building of great fountains.
Diverting rivers was not uncommon, even in the days before electric
pumps. The Avenue of the Hundred Fountains at the Villa d'Este was
made possible by rechanneling the Aniene River. And the 1,000
fountains of Versailles were activated by water pumped from a
tributary of the Seine, 40 miles away.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One might expect a considerable gap between fountains developed
for public display and those built for private consumption. Oddly,
the evidence suggests that when it comes to fountains, public and
private often differ only in matters of scale. Geneva's famed Jet
d'Eau suspends 7 tons of water in a column more than 400 feet high
at any given moment.
</P>
<P>
   The New York designers Stephen Sills and James Huniford have
their own jet d'eau at home in Bedford, albeit one that shoots up
only 20 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Kiley, who has landscaped more than 1,500 public and private
gardens, sees almost no difference beyond size. ``The thing about
water is that it can do what nothing else can do,'' Kiley said.
``But it's always the same process.'' For Fountain Place in Dallas,
Kiley composed terraces of water, cascading from level to level,
dotted with 440 bald cypresses and enhanced with 263 bubbler
fountains.
</P>
<P>
   Something quieter was called for at the Kimmel residence in
Salisbury, Conn. One of the main features of the house overlooking
the Taconic Mountains is a croquet lawn edged by two 100-foot water
canals that are flush with the grass, thus creating shimmering
slick mirages of water. Where they meet, a small fountain erupts,
as if bubbling euphorically over the view.
</P>
<P>
   Fountains needn't be so precise or ornate, Kiley said.
``Everyone should have some kind of water about them,'' he
continued, extolling the virtues of the hose and the unplugged fire
hydrant.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent fountains featured in ``Fountains: Splash and
Spectacle'' are freer interpretations of the word. Maya Lin's
Sounding Stones, situated at the Federal Courthouse plaza in lower
Manhattan, is made of large stones of granite carved with viewing
holes; water runs within, audible but not visible. It draws
passers-by to approach, peer through the holes, perhaps to touch
the water, thus refreshing the body as well as the soul.

COMPUTER MONITOR NEED NOT TAKE A TOLL ON THE EYES
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By ANNE EISENBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are a number of ways to reduce eyestrain at the computer.
Much of the advice is common sense, but some of it is contradictory
and some is idealistic _ who wouldn't prefer a 20-inch screen?
</P>
<P>
   MAKE THE DISPLAY SHARP AND CLEAR. The eyes like to focus on
distinct borders, which is a challenge with fuzzy pixels and
consequently fuzzy letters. Make the type as distinct and readable
as possible:
</P>
<P>
   _ Large, dark letters. Dark letters on a light background work
better than the reverse. Experiment with the typefaces; some are
easier to read than others.
</P>
<P>
   _ Large monitor: A 20-inch screen is easier on the eyes than a
14-inch. Given good software, the larger screen will in effect
increase the resolution, which is helpful.
</P>
<P>
   _ Uncluttered viewing: Remove notes and decorations from the rim
of the monitor to reduce distractions.
</P>
<P>
   USE GOOD LIGHTING. Reduce or eliminate reflections:
</P>
<P>
   _ Glare from outside: Place the monitor perpendicular to the
window. Adjust blinds or shades to minimize the amount of direct
light on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   _ Glare from inside: Use a glare screen approved by the American
Optometric Association, (800) 365-2219. Adjust lights and the
monitor to keep light from reflecting into the eyes. Cover white
shirts with a darker jacket or sweater. Clean the screen regularly.
</P>
<P>
   REST OFTEN.To help the eyes, you can take several steps: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Blink: People blink less frequently when they fix on the
screen, and the eyes become dry. Remind yourself to blink.
</P>
<P>
   _ Take frequent breaks: Look away from the screen into the
distance, then close the eyes for 5 to 10 seconds. Do this at least
every hour.
</P>
<P>
   ADJUST THE SCREEN POSITION. The height of the screen and
distance from the user should be adjusted for each person: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Height: Don't place the screen at an angle that requires you
to look up. That makes the eyes dry more quickly, and the position
bothers the neck.
</P>
<P>
   Try looking at the monitor screen at an angle 10 to 20 degrees
below the horizontal, directly in front of the eye. (If you use
bifocals and are reading through the lower part of lenses, lower
the position of screen.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Distance: The monitor should be an arm's length away _ 18 to
28 inches _ given the constraints of a desk. Adjust the chair so
the screen can be read without leaning forward. &QL;

GOOD HOUSEKEEPING HONORS WOMEN FOR GOVERNMENT SERVICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Good Housekeeping magazine honored 10 women for
excellence in government service Wednesday, including the mayor of
San Jose, Calif., and a member of the Los Angeles County Board of
Supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose Mayor Susan Hammer was one of nine women receiving
$2,500 during an awards ceremony in the Capitol. She was selected
for creating Project Diversity, a program to recruit minorities
into government jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., who spoke at the ceremony, said
Hammer ``rolled up her sleeves and by reaching out to everyone of
talent, turned that city around.''
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Molina, a member of the Los Angeles Board of Supervisors,
also won for launching a program called Greater Avenues to
Independence, which helped bring thousands of welfare recipients
into the workforce and is considered a model for the rest of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The top winner, Estelle B. Richman, Philadelphia city health
commissioner, was presented with a check for $25,000. She was
recognized for creating a nonprofit corporation, Community
Behavioral Health, which provides care for the city's poor.
</P>
<P>
   Richmond said she was accepting the award ``on behalf of all
those who suffer from mental health and substance abuse problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Levine, editor of Good Housekeeping, said by establishing
the award, the magazine ``hopes to identify women fighting to make
a difference in today's society and re-establish a trust in
government... It is our editorial responsibility to help make a
difference in women's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxer cited women's suffrage leaders Elizabeth Cady Stanton and
Susan B. Anthony who argued that women should be active in politics
because they bring a fresh perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, as we honor these 10 gifted leaders, it makes me think
that, perhaps, we are coming close to realizing the dreams of the
visionary women who began the fight for women's rights a century
ago,'' Boxer said.
</P>
<P>
   Former Texas Gov. Ann Richards, who attended the ceremony and
luncheon with about 100 women, said she hopes the Good Housekeeping
award encourages women who are in government to stay there _
despite the frustrations and low pay.
</P>
<P>
   The award ``says to young people this is a good, a noble and an
honorable profession,'' Richards said.
</P>
<P>
   Other winners included:
</P>
<P>
   _ Harriet Cornell, who developed programs in Rockland County,
N.Y., to prevent violence, promote arts and help women with
political goals.
</P>
<P>
   _ Susan Daniels, deputy Social Security commissioner for
disability and income security, a polio survivor, who launched a
government program that has helped disabled people in 22 states buy
their own homes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mary Gade, director of the Illinois Environmental Protection
Agency, who helped form an association of 37 states to figuring out
how to clean up ozone, a polluting gas that causes respiratory
problems.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nancy Mayer, treasurer for the State of Rhode Island, who
revamped her state's pension system.
</P>
<P>
   _ Barbara Powell, superintendent of the Robert E. Ellsworth
Correctional Center for Women in Union Grove, Wis., who has helped
inmates with drug rehabilitation and job training.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kelly Shepard, a park ranger who has helped safeguard
artifacts and archaeological sites in Colorado's Mesa Verde
National Park.
</P>
<P>
   _ Natacha Seijas Millan, a county commissioner in Miami-Dade
County, Fla., who started the county's ``stroller parking law,''
which requires large parking lots to provide special spots for
families with small children.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's Saturday night in the big city. After weeks of
busy work and busier schedules, a loving couple has set these hours
aside for some overdue quality time, in the form of a cozy evening
at home.
</P>
<P>
   This experience has become something of an urban ritual in
Manhattan, a sometimes-prized amenity of life in a city with easy
access to restaurants for take-out or delivery, eclectic video
stores, and late-night wine shops.
</P>
<P>
   As Woody Allen once said, he wouldn't want to live where he
couldn't get a bowl of wonton soup at four in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Internet companies are trying to make it even easier
to stay home. Just boot up, surf to the food or video delivery
sites, place the orders, then wait for the goods to arrive. To find
out if this is really better than the offline way, the couple
decided to road test the options, planning one date night online,
and another offline.
</P>
<P>
   Every good date night needs a bottle of wine. For now, ordering
a bottle of Chardonnay via the Net is a work in progress. One site,
Virtual Vineyards (www.virtualvineyard.com), aims to be the
Amazon.com of vino, carrying hundreds of bottles of wine from $10
up.
</P>
<P>
   Someone craving, say, an Austrian Merlot can use the site's
search engine to narrow down the choices by wineries and types. For
those who just don't know what to serve with a salmon mousse, the
vineyard's self-described ''Cork Dork'' answers e-mail questions
about the delicate art of pairing wine and food.
</P>
<P>
   Once the bottle's selected, it's $5 - $10 for shipping,
depending on the size of the order, with deliveries taking 2 - 5
days. So much for spontaneity. And if one hopes the Zinfandel comes
chilled, forget about it.
</P>
<P>
   Online wine delivery makes more sense now for the serious
collector who wants to order cases of a particular brand or
vintage. Otherwise, daters are better off running down to the local
store; the clerk might not be as knowledgeable as the Cork Dork,
but is liable to have some good suggestions anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Next, it's time for a restaurant delivery site like NY Delivery
(www.nydelivery.com). Run by an East Village restaurant owner, NY
Delivery contains over 500 restaurant menus from around Manhattan
(other boroughs coming soon). Click the appropriate neighborhood
from the city map on the home page, and it links to a list of
nearby dining establishments.
</P>
<P>
   Each restaurant has its own page, listing the entire menu. Click
through the items desired, and each gets added up immediately on
the site.
</P>
<P>
   Once the order is sent, NY Delivery e-mails back a confirmation
then sends a fax to the appropriate restaurant, which prepares and
deliver the food. NY Delivery is not yet able to process credit
card transactions, so all payments are cash.
</P>
<P>
   There's no extra cost for the service, since NY Delivery takes a
6 percent cut of the restaurants earnings. Best of all: no
rummaging through the junk drawer for a half dozen torn menus.
</P>
<P>
   With the food and wine on the way, boot up a video delivery
service like Kozmo.com (www.kozmo.com), a service in New York that
plans to expand in other cities. Unlike the neighborhood video
store, which might have 10,000 videos, Kozmo stocks over 20,000,
ranging from Psycho to Stealing Beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Videos are categorized by genre, plus there's a search engine
and staff recommendations. Feeling romantic? Try David Lynch's Lost
Highway, Kozmo says.
</P>
<P>
   Once the video's chosen, top it off with some Milk Duds or
popcorn, then click the order through. Each video is $3.50 and gets
delivered to the door within an hour. Tipping is not required,
though the video recipient might feel guilt with no tip.
</P>
<P>
   When the film's over, customers can either have Kozmo pick it up
(for an extra $1) or can deposit it at designated drop-off centers
_ though most are not open 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   At present, the online method seems best suited for serious
Webheads or workers too busy to leave their desks. And as any
couple knows, the real challenge in planning a date night _ at
home, or anywhere _ is choosing what to see, eat, and drink. If
agreeing on a video seems hard, just imagine deciding who gets to
hold the mouse.

&HT;        BOXER BILL URGES MORE RESEARCH INTO SILICON BREAST IMPLANTS
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Robin Brown  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Washington, June 10 -- Talk show host Jenny Jones -- live via
satellite from Los Angeles -- joined Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif.,
to introduce legislation calling for a three-pronged approach to
insure women seeking breast implants have comprehensive, unbiased
information before making any decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make sure women have the information up front,''
said Boxer. ``Women need accurate and complete information to make
informed choices and to get appropriate medical treatment,
especially cancer survivors who chose implants after surgery only
to suffer all over again.'' Women who have gotten silicon implants
have come forward with a variety of health problems, often serious.
Hundreds of thousands of women have filed lawsuits against Dow
Corning and other silicon implant manufacturers, claiming multiple
ailments. Boxer said there needs to be more independent study on
these adverse effects of the implants.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would encourage the National Institutes of Health to
expand research programs, create a Presidential committee to
coordinate federal agencies, and would insure that women have
access to the most up-to-date, complete information on implants
from their doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who has had five breast implants over the course of ten
years, said having access to independent, accurate information is
crucial to making safe decisions -- information she didn't get in
time.
</P>
<P>
   Calling breast implants the biggest mistake of her life, Jones
said, ``If I had the information I would not be where I am today.''
</P>
<P>
   Each time she had the implant surgery, the doctors assured her
it was safe. But each time -- whether the implants ruptured or the
silicon leaked, eventually sticking to her rib cage -- the surgery
proved far from safe, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like a walking time bomb because I don't know what's
going to happen,'' she said angrily.

LEAPING CENTURIES IN A SINGLE STEP, A MINIMALIST GOES DIGITAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MARGARET LOKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Trained the old-fashioned way in her native
Copenhagen to photograph without light meters and to make her own
emulsions in the darkroom, Marianne Engberg is cheerfully
nonchalant about the lengths she goes to in pursuit of her art.
</P>
<P>
   She takes black-and-white photographs with pinhole cameras,
equipment so primitive that she has made the ones she uses out of
Quaker Oats boxes and black masking tape. The speed of the pinhole
is so slow that she thinks nothing of waiting out exposure times
ranging from 7 to 90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by The New York Times to try a point-and-shoot digital
camera _ the polar opposite of her technologically challenged
pinhole camera _ Ms. Engberg was instantly intrigued.
</P>
<P>
   She tried an early-generation digital camera, widely available
and not too expensive _ the Sony Mavica FD5, the world's first
digital still camera using standard 3{-inch high-density floppy
disks to store images that can later be viewed on a computer.
</P>
<P>
   t was a sunny spring day, perfect for pictures of shadows, which
Ms. Engberg has been photographing with her pinhole camera for the
last year or so. She chose a few blocks in the low 80s on the Upper
West Side.
</P>
<P>
   She was initially distracted by the digital camera's
point-and-shoot inflexibility. But she quickly realized that there
was something familiar about her inability to select an F-stop
(controlling the amount of light passing through the lens) or
change the shutter speed (the duration of the exposure).
</P>
<P>
   ``This is strange,'' she said. ``It's like using a pinhole.''
(The pinhole camera, which is devoid of all helpful photographic
gadgetry, has a simple underlying principle: light passing through
a small hole on one side of a darkened box casts the outside image
on the opposite side of the box.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Engberg also realized that the digital camera, like the
pinhole camera, offers an infinite depth of field: everything is in
focus.
</P>
<P>
   She wondered, though, why Sony had not thought of providing a
hood for the LCD screen on the camera that allows the photographer
to compose the desired images. In bright sunlight, it was difficult
to see what was on it.
</P>
<P>
   As she took pictures of a succession of shadows of railings cast
on walls and on the ground, Ms. Engberg marveled at the ease and
speed of her picture-taking. ``I'm used to having a long time
thinking about each shot,'' she said. ``Suddenly, here I am, going
click click click.''
</P>
<P>
   As she got used to the digital camera, Ms. Engberg remembered
that she could lighten or darken her exposures. She liked that
feature. ``With a regular camera,'' she said, ``you make a
photograph lighter or darker, but you have to do it in your head.
You don't see it. Here, I could actually see it by pressing a
button.''
</P>
<P>
   The playbacks on the LCD screen were very reassuring, and Ms.
Engberg began to appreciate the attraction of digital cameras. ``I
like being able to see instantly what I've shot,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Now and then, she forgot that she was not dealing with a
traditional camera. When it came time to change the floppy disk,
she wondered if she should ``go to someplace dark, as with a
regular camera.'' Reminded that there was no film in the camera,
Ms. Engberg caught herself and laughed.
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Engberg, taking pictures with the digital camera at
night in Times Square was disconcerting, she said, because the
images on the LCD screen ``are flat _ there is no mood on the
screen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sony Mavica FD5, or MVC-FD5, has shutter speeds that range
from one-sixtieth to one four-thousandths of a second, so a flash
is necessary only for a picture in virtual darkness. Because the
camera is so sensitive to light, Ms. Engberg found that when she
tried to make the images on the LCD screen lighter, she got shots
that resembled daytime scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Unwilling to give up, she took a full disk of night images, not
expecting much to come out of them.
</P>
<P>
   When the floppy disk files were viewed through Netscape, the
images Ms. Engberg had taken held a few disappointments. The
digital camera seemed unable to cope with sharp contrasts in light
and dark in indoor shots; bright sections were reduced to white
patches.
</P>
<P>
   The camera also found it difficult to deal with complex
compositions. At the time the images were taken, the LCD screen
registered perfectly wonderful compositions. With 640-by-480-pixels
resolution, the $500 MVC-FD5 does not offer the truly sharp
contrasts one can get with a $300 regular camera.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, though, the results were a pleasant surprise.
</P>
<P>
   The initial images were on the anemic side, as expected, because
Ms. Engberg had not adjusted the exposures. Then the images got
sharper, and Ms. Engberg was amazed by the unusually rich tones in
images taken under direct sunlight.

<P>
   ``The colors are different from those produced by a regular
camera,'' she said. ``The greens are greener and the yellows are
yellower. I like the colors here.''
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Engberg photographed a scavenger silhouetted by rays of
sunlight, she was not sure what she would get. With a regular
camera, she said, the rays of the sun would appear white. But the
digital camera caught a lovely shower of green and red and yellow.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest surprises of all were the night pictures. Ms.
Engberg knew that the digital camera would not produce good images
of, say, a whole city block. And no amount of exposure adjustment
would make the camera record the delicately nuanced reflection of
light on a stainless steel wall.
</P>
<P>
   But where the camera did not have to take into account a host of
conflicting light readings, it gave astonishingly striking images,
like the Times Square Tower bathed in light, for instance. Or the
oscillating billboard at the corner of 43rd Street and Seventh
Avenue, with the camera arresting a moment the eye could not see.

   Sammye Irwin of Arlington sent a request labeled ``Panic Note.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have any recipes for petite quiches and petite
cheesecake that can be served at weddings, open houses, etc.?''
</P>
<P>
   I see just a hint of hysteria here, so this week's column
addresses all you folks who are hosting a festive event this
summer. Bless your hearts.
</P>
<P>
   This quiche recipe is from Barbara Kafka's ``Party Food: Small &AMP;
Savory'' (Morrow, $25), a book I always turn to when planning a
party. It's well worth the purchase price. Kafka obviously is an
experienced hostess who knows how important it is to be able to
make party fare in advance. Every recipe in the book gives freezing
or make-ahead directions.
</P>
<P>
   The second recipe, for sweet mouthfuls, is from ``Dessert in
Half the Time'' by Linda West Eckhardt and Diana Collingwood Butts
(Crown, $25). I'd suggest doing this in pretty little foil cupcake
liners.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   MINIATURE MUSHROOM QUICHE
</P>
<P>
   Yields 24
</P>
<P>
   Cream cheese pastry: 4 ounces (1/2 cup) cream cheese at room
temperature
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   1 cup all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   Beat cream cheese and butter together in mixing bowl until
smooth and creamy. Add flour and salt and gradually work into dough
until mixture comes together to form a ball.
</P>
<P>
   Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   On lightly floured surface, roll out dough to about 1/8-inch
thick. Cut out pastry shapes to fit your 2- to 3-inch pans and
press in pastry using your knuckles. Prick base of pastry in each
pan twice with a fork and place filled tins on a baking sheet.
Re-roll pastry scraps to use up all pastry. Each cup needs about
1/2 ounce of pastry per tartlet shell. To use this dough for
quiche, only partially bake the shells. To use for an already
cooked mixture (or an uncooked mixture, such as chicken salad),
bake the shells fully.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees with rack in center. Place shells in
oven and bake for 12 minutes for partially baked crust and 17
minutes for fully baked crust.
</P>
<P>
   Remove from oven; tip baked shells out of pans and transfer to a
wire rack to cool completely. The partially baked shells can be
filled with any quiche mixture and baked as for quiche recipes.
Fully baked shells can be used immediately, or they can be
carefully packed in airtight boxes and kept at room temperature for
up to 2 days. Don't fill until shortly before serving. Partially
baked shells that are not being used immediately for quiche should
be carefully packed in plastic bags and stored in the refrigerator
for a week or freezer for up to a month.
</P>
<P>
   Partially baked and frozen or refrigerated shells for use as
quiches should be re-placed in tins and allowed to come to room
temperature before filling and normal baking. Partially baked and
frozen or refrigerated shells to use as containers for precooked
mixture should be placed on a baking sheet (not air-cushioned) in a
350-degree oven; from room temperature, the shells take 4 minutes;
directly from refrigerator, 6 minutes, directly from freezer, 8
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Mushroom filling:
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   3 ounces fresh small domestic mushrooms, wiped clean, trimmed
and coarsely chopped by hand
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 teaspoons Pernod
</P>
<P>
   1 egg
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons chopped fresh dill sprigs or fennel fronds
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt, to taste
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Melt butter in small skillet over medium heat. Stir in mushrooms
and cook for about 2 minutes or until they just start to give off
some liquid. Stir in cream and Pernod and continue to cook for
about 2 minutes or until mixture comes to a boil.
</P>
<P>
   Remove from heat and allow to cool to room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Lightly beat egg in small mixing bowl. Stir in mushroom mixture
with dill or fennel. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Fill partially baked pastry shells and bake for 10 minutes.
Remove from oven and allow to cool slightly on a wire rack before
serving.
</P>
<P>
   The completed quiches can be frozen after baking and being
allowed to cool. Reheat frozen quiches in a single layer on a
baking sheet (not air-cushioned) for 10 minutes at 350 degrees.

DEFENDING CHAMPION BRAZIL STRUGGLES IN CUP OPENER, A 2-1 WIN OVER
SCOTLAND  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. DENIS, France _ Brazil's coach, Mario Zagallo, said he would
know in the first match whether he had great players or a great
team. The fans had already made up their mind. When Zagallo was
introduced Wednesday, he was booed. But his team did what a
defending champion must do in the opener of the World Cup. It
survived, even if it took Scotland putting a goal into its own net
to provide a 2-1 victory for Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   There is a certain fatalism about this team, which Brazil's fans
and media have accused of abandoning ``the beautiful game'' for
defense and individualism. And there is always tremendous
expectation and pressure on a defending champion in the opening of
the World Cup, especially when that champion is Brazil, where the
passion for the game is overwhelming and perhaps irrational.
</P>
<P>
   So, few people will be satisfied with Wednesday's outcome, but
that is beside the point. Brazil won its first match, which
Argentina could not do against Cameroon in 1990 and which Germany
struggled to accomplish against Bolivia in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   With 3 points in the standings, Brazil can now relax for a few
days and perhaps even look ahead to the next round after upcoming
group matches against Morocco and Norway. Those teams played
Wednesday night in Montpellier.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very difficult but a big satisfaction,'' said Zagallo,
66, who has been a coach or player on all four of Brazil's World
Cup championship teams. ``This was very important win because it
was the first match of the World Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   The deciding goal came in the 73d minute, three minutes after
Zagallo had benched his subdued forward, Bebeto, and enlivened his
team with the open play of Denilson.
</P>
<P>
   Cafu, the Brazilian defender, slashed into the penalty area and
Dunga chipped a perfect pass to his feet. Cafu tried to lift the
ball over the Scottish goalkeeper, Jim Leighton, who at 40 is the
oldest player in the tournament, but the ball bounced off
Leighton's face toward his teammate Tommy Boyd. Scrambling to help,
Boyd could not prevent the rebound from bouncing off his shoulder
into the goal. Incredulous, and a little lucky, Cafu did a flip in
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's first goal, in the fifth minute, was also unorthodox.
Bebeto aimed a corner kick toward the goal and midfielder Cesar
Sampaio timed his jump, only to have Scotland's Craig Burley put a
hand on his shoulder and shove him in the back. Sampaio was thrown
off slightly, but the ball richocheted off his right shoulder past
a stunned Leighton.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no denying the better team won, but we had a great
chance not to lose,'' said Craig Brown, Scotland's coach. ``We gave
away two very bad goals from a technical point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   Scotland had positioned itself for a welcomed 1-1 tie after
Sampaio committed a foolish foul on Scottish striker Kevin
Gallacher in the 38th minute, shoving him down in the penalty area
and drawing a yellow card. John Collins took the penalty kick and
slammed a low blast inside the left post, past the dive of
Taffarel, the Brazilian goalkeeper.
</P>
<P>
   Brown sandwiched seven players into the penalty box area in the
second half, determined not to give Ronaldo any room to operate.
Not that he needed any. The 21-year-old Brazilian forward is
considered the world's best player and his talents _ at least all
but goal scoring _ were on full display Wednesday. Every time he
touched the ball or raced toward the goal, the 80,000-seat Stade de
France throbbed with anticipation.
</P>
<P>
   Ronaldo did not disappoint here in the northern Paris suburbs.
In the first half, he dribbled his way through three Scottish
defenders in the penalty area, like a slalom skier going through
gates, and fired a wicked line drive that Leighton saved with a
desperate lunge.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The game was flawed but always entertaining, as was the
beautifully inscrutable opening ceremony that has become de rigeur
for the French since the Fellini-esque opening to the 1992 Winter
Olympics in Albertville, France. Ladybugs entered on stilts and
bounded on trampolines while giant flowers budded from a canvas
lawn in what appeared to be the world's most extravagant tribute to
cross-pollination. Trapeze artists rapelled from the roof of the
futuristic stadium, bearing flags of the 32 teams competing in the
World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, Brazilian fans in their gold and green shirts, and
Scottish fans in their tartan kilts and red wigs, mingled
peacefully before the match; if there was no common language,
alcohol provided a common purpose. Jimmy McKay, an actuary from
Chicago, said his wife let him travel to Europe once a year to
watch Scotland play soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a condition of our marriage,'' McKay said. ``She's from
Kentucky. She doesn't like football. She doesn't like the state I
get into, the state of alcoholic refreshment.''
</P>
<P>
   Said John Irvine of Glasgow: ``If we win, the Eiffel Tower will
be wearing a kilt.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazil fans seemed to think that, no matter Wednesday's outcome,
this team would not repeat as World Cup champions. ``They don't
play Brazil's kind of football,'' said Helio Souza of Sao Paulo,
where the Stock Exchange was closed for Wednesday match. ``Zagallo
likes defense too much. He doesn't take risks.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be much debate about who should start at forward next
against Morocco _ the ineffective Bebeto, the magical Denilson or
the volatile Edmundo. But that is a turmoil for another day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy to have a win,'' Ronaldo said. ``The first match is
always the most difficult.''

TUMULT OVER WHO IS KING OF `SIMON SAYS' GAME

<TEXT>
<P>
   Two things irk Allan Tresser, the 77-year-old ``tummler'' who
has been entertaining hotel guests in the Catskills for nearly 60
years and the self-proclaimed king of Simon Says.
</P>
<P>
   The first is that the management of the Fallsview Hotel in
Ellenville, N.Y., where Tresser roams the lobby in his shades, a
stained, blue track suit and a thick gold ``Simon Sez'' necklace,
has decided Tresser can no longer do the warm-ups for the stage
shows.
</P>
<P>
   The other is the parade of guests who confuse Tresser with his
ancient bete noire, Lou Goldstein, interrupting Tresser even when
he's in the middle of a very important conversation to ask if he's
the guy who led them in Simon Says 30 years ago at Grossinger's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lou Goldstein,'' Tresser says shortly, grudging the time it
takes to wrap his mouth around the name.
</P>
<P>
   Then, to the reporter: ``No, don't write it down, I don't want
to give him any publicity. I hate that guy. You know what Lou
Goldstein was before he was at Grossinger's? A basketball player at
Long Island University or someplace. A good ball-player. But never
an entertainer.''
</P>
<P>
   We're indoors, Tresser _ what's with the sunglasses?
</P>
<P>
   Tresser removes them briefly, showing red-rimmed eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``My eyes are burned out from the spotlights,'' Tresser says.
</P>
<P>
   Gone are the summers of the '40s and '50s, when hundreds of
small hotels dotted the Catskills Mountains and the tummler, whose
name means ``the maker of noise and merriment,'' led the summer
guests in games, often ending a set with that perennial mountain
favorite, jumping into the pool fully clothed.
</P>
<P>
   Tresser, who leads a one-hour game of Simon Says at the
Fallsview, now takes a break for guests to take their
nitroglycerine pills.
</P>
<P>
   The years have also taken their toll on Tresser. Twice divorced,
he now lives in a small room at the Fallsview.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might as well move into the hotel,'' Tresser's last wife
said, before departing. ``You're in love with the hotel, raise the
hotel.''
</P>
<P>
   Tresser was a Lower East Side guy who went to the Catskills, as
a musician, in 1936. He can't take credit for inventing Simon Says,
Tresser says _ it's an old English game _ but he did make it famous
in the Borscht Belt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was playing Sam Fisher's Plaza in Mountaindale _ there was a
man doing Simon Says, but it had no end,'' Tresser says.
</P>
<P>
   How can there be no end to Simon Says? If you do something Simon
doesn't tell you to do, you're out.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no way to put people out fast,'' explains Tresser.
``My game is based on reflexes. I played in it every hotel in the
mountains. In '42, I go into the service. I get out in '45, five or
six guys have been doing it. I have to start from scratch.''
</P>
<P>
   Tresser did a Simon Says act with blue jays. He did Simon Says
on the Mike Douglas Show in 1968, eliminating the participants so
fast, he claims, that Mike Douglas himself had to play for eight
minutes to fill the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``To this day, the management of this hotel offers $10,000 to
any competitor I can't put out in a three-minute period,'' Tresser
says.
</P>
<P>
   Management clarifies this later.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no such guarantee,'' says Charles Slutsky, the
managing director of the Fallsview. ``I've threatened Allan's life
numerous times for saying it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tresser's telling of his life story omits this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Years ago, I wanted to have a show,'' Tresser says. ``Me, Lou
Goldstein, Lee Berman from the Concord, just the three of us on
stage doing Simon Says. Just let me go first. Nobody would do it.
Why? Because if I go on first, they can't go on. Because nobody
will be left standing. I'm that good.''
</P>
<P>
   Where is Berman these days?
</P>
<P>
   ``Dead,'' says Tresser.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein?
</P>
<P>
   ``Living in a little place in Liberty, I think,'' Tresser says.
``I had lunch with him six months ago. I loaned him $200. The check
bounced. You know, when he did Simon Says, he wouldn't let little
kids play. What kind of a man does that?''
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein, now 70, is indeed living a half-hour away, in
Liberty, N.Y. Hearing the name ``Allan Tresser,'' he comes close to
hanging up the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not interested,'' Goldstein says. ``I hope I don't sound
bitter, but the man is an idiot.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein is willing, however, to discuss his current
circumstances, which are not as dire as Tresser suggests. Goldstein
does Simon Says at the Raleigh Hotel and at halftimes of National
Basketball Association games. Goldstein did not lunch recently with
Tresser.
</P>
<P>
   Tresser's claim that he is the king of Simon Says?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I don't want to discuss him _ the man doesn't know
what he's talking about,'' Goldstein says. ``I came to Grossinger's
in 1950 to play basketball; Abe Sharkey, who worked at
Grossinger's, told me he started doing it in 1936. It was strictly
a Catskills thing. Nobody knew about the game outside the Catskills
until I went on national TV in 1960 and I popularized it.''
</P>
<P>
   The charge that Goldstein does not allow children in his game?
</P>
<P>
   A long silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, God, '' Goldstein says, aggrieved and disgusted. ``You
don't take a game that is played by kids _ look, I do the Simon
Says Championship for Kids three times a year at the Concord. I did
it on a kid show called `Wonderama.' You ever hear of
`Wonderama'?''

SPORTS COLUMN: WORLD'S TEAM KICKS OFF WORLD CUP  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST.-DENIS, France _ The No. 13 metro train was bobbing up and
down from the sheer brute rhythm of hundreds of Scots jumping in
place, singing utterly salacious lyrics to familiar tunes. You
wouldn't believe what they did to Ronaldo to the tune of ``Walking
in a Winter Wonderland.''
</P>
<P>
   What was amazing was that along with their blue wigs and painted
faces and tartan kilts, many of the Scots wore something yellow _
something Brazilian. They could chant crude ditties about their
opponent, but they wore Brazil's colors all the same.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil is soccer, the heart, the soul, the flashing feet,
whether in the era of Pele and Garrincha, the era of Socrates and
Zico, the era of Romario and Bebeto, or now, the era of Ronaldo
There was a highly unofficial all-time soccer team named the other
day, and although the organizers aimed for political correctness,
to give many nations a touch of action, there were four Brazilians
among the top 11. Sounds about right.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilians were back in the World Cup Wednesday, with exotic
flicks with their insteps, sudden 90-degree swerves, nifty passes
that made the crowd gasp. They forced one goal with a shoulder and
one goal off an opponent for a 2-1 victory in the opening game.
</P>
<P>
   Their fans don't seem to take the metro. One could imagine them
in their familiar swarm, dancing the samba, hundreds of them,
shimmering and strutting, from the center of Paris _ boom,
gaga-boom, gaga-boom _ all the way to the new stadium. If they had
taken the metro, it would have swayed back and forth. Brazil has
the beat.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Mario Zagallo _ who has been a part of all four
Brazilian World Cup championships as player or assistant coach _
needed a jump start in a 1-1 tie. Romario, the star of 1994, was
home with premature old age. Bebeto was on the field, but
ineffective. The crowd chanted for Edmundo and it got Leonardo at
the half, then Denilson. What a sense of richness, what national
treasures Brazil has.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have put in Edmundo, but that would have strengthened
our inside game,'' Zagallo would say later. ``Instead, I wanted an
open game. That was the correct move.''
</P>
<P>
   Denilson entered in the 70th minute and started dancing with the
ball like a street entertainer working for the coins of the crowd.
He would do anything to please, a feint here, a dash there, maybe
even a pass. He opened up the game so suddenly that Brazil scored
on an own goal by the hapless defender, Tommy Boyd, only 3 minutes
later. And the stands went boom, gaga-boom, gaga-boom.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil brings that beat to the World Cup. The people from
MasterCard asked a panel of soccer experts to pick the mythical
all-time 11: Lev Yashin, the late Soviet goalkeeper; Franz
Beckenbauer of West Germany, the late Bobby Moore of England, Johan
Cruyff of the Netherlands, Alfredo diStefano of Argentina, Michel
Platini of France, and Diego Maradona of Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the Brazilians _ Carlos Alberto, Nilton Santos,
Pele and the late Garrincha, the star of the 1958 and 1962 World
Cups, who died young and destitute from his excesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played with him, I lived with him, he was the godfather of
my daughter,'' said Nilton Santos, now 73. ``Every Jan. 20, I light
a candle for him. People think of what he did with the Brazilian
national team but they forget what he did for his club. He was
fantastic, as a player and as a person, and he never hurt
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony included old videos of all these stalwarts _
remarkably limber and inventive, wide open, before the defensive
technicians arranged chains and bolts and nets and clamps to slow
down the world's offense.
</P>
<P>
   The four old lions (the three Brazilians and diStefano) who
attended the press conference on Tuesday seemed to love their game
with a personal passion that exceeds the way old American athletes
talk about their sports. And they lamented the defensive tactics of
today, however inevitable they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today the coaches want to be the star,'' Pele said. ``In my
time, the star was the player. Today, strategy is more important
than the game. That is a problem today.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilians were not entirely delighted when Carlos Alberto
Parreira won in 1994 by playing brusque efficient soccer. The fans
today mutter when Zagallo talks about curbing the Brazilian flair.
But when the crowd gets edgy, and Brazil needs a life, there is
always a Leonardo, there is always a Denilson, and the beat goes
on, boom, gaga-boom, gaga-boom. Even Scots wear yellow.

STATES EXPLORE ALTERNATIVES TO FEDERAL DISASTER RELIEF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MIKE HUREWITZ  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ As officials in upstate New York anxiously await
a decision on whether federal aid will be available for areas
damaged by recent severe weather, Congress is pushing to shift more
of the financial burden to local governments, according to
emergency administrators around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Several states, including California, Florida and Vermont, have
created rainy-day disaster funds to augment federal aid and upgrade
emergency preparedness.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Congress is telling the states,'' said Fred Koutnik, a
top Florida emergency-management administrator, ``is we are no
longer going to fund these horrendous, spiraling upwards costs of
disasters. And they are looking to us guys _ New York,
Pennsylvania, Florida, Texas and California as the bad guys. We
gobble up most of the presidential funds.''
</P>
<P>
   Special federal funds flow to states when the president
determines that a disaster is beyond the resources of state and
local governments. The decision is based on data compiled by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Officials are still assessing whether the five counties in New
York hit hardest by last week's destructive storms are eligible for
disaster relief.
</P>
<P>
   Since the summer of 1995, New York has had six presidential
disasters declared, according to Dennis Michalski of the State
Emergency Management Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the hot issue between the states and federal government
at this point,'' said David Rodham, undersecretary of public safety
for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and past president of the
National Emergency Management Association.
</P>
<P>
   James Lee Witt, director of the FEMA, has urged states to
establish rainy-day funds, spokesman Barbara Yagerman said.
</P>
<P>
   But a spokesman for New York Gov. George Pataki said the
governor is confident that New York's current approach is
satisfactory. The state finances disaster relief from its general
fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think under Gov. Pataki's direction, we demonstrated that
the state has been effective in meeting the needs of victims of
several disasters _ from the Long Island wildfires, to the ice
storms, and more recently, the tornadoes,'' said Pataki spokesman
Patrick McCarthy.
</P>
<P>
   After suffering five presidential disasters in three years, the
Vermont Legislature earlier this year approved an emergency
reserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally don't think states across the country are going
to get presidential-declared disasters as easily as they have in
the past,'' said George L. Lowe, director of Vermont Emergency
Management. ``Can you imagine what you would do if you had a major
event and the feds didn't come. That could happen over in Albany or
here in Montpelier. It sounds hokey, but you've got to be
prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Massachusetts and South Carolina are weighing measures that
would establish a so-called rainy-day fund. Rodham said the
approach is prudent because it budgets for the unexpected and
doesn't require the legislators to return for a special session to
approve supplemental financing.
</P>
<P>
   The outlook for passage in both states is uncertain. But the
proposals generally founder in state legislators because of
controversy over how the reserve will be funded. Often it is
through a surcharge on insurance policies.
</P>
<P>
   That was the approach adopted by Florida, whose 1993 legislation
was perhaps the first of its kind in the country. It was approved
in the aftermath of the $25 billion in damages caused by Hurricane
Andrew, which hit Aug. 24, 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Initially opposed by the insurance industry, it puts a $4
surcharge on every commercial policy and $2 for every private
insurance contract. This year it raised $16 million.
</P>
<P>
   Florida used 48 percent of the funds to enhance local emergency
management offices, 27 percent to finance projects that may limit
future storm damage and sets aside roughly 20 percent, or $4
million, to supplement FEMA aid.
</P>
<P>
   California used its emergency-relief fund to help the needy who
suffer disaster losses. It will augment by up to $10,000 the
$13,400 maximum that FEMA offers to individuals and families who
are uninsured and too poor a credit risk to qualify for the
low-interest loans that are made available when a federal disaster
is declared.

 IN THE HEADLIGHTS: PDAs AND VIRTUAL PETS  
 (bl)  
 By J.C. HERZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Georgia World Congress Center in Atlanta contains 35
football fields' worth of exhibition space. During the Electronic
Entertainment Expo in May, it contained the equivalent of 35
football fields filled with video games _ PC games, console games
and handheld games _ peripherals and accessories of all
descriptions, as well as thousands of developers, software
publishers, retailers, investors and journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Crammed with 12-foot screens and massive speakers, looming
exhibition domes, lasers, showgirls and video game mayhem at every
turn, it's sheer heaven or sheer hell, depending on your
personality. But whether you wallow in the spectacle or run
screaming, E3 is a once-a-year chance to view the universe of
interactive entertainment and to see what's on the horizon for
Christmas and early '99. Here's a report from the trenches:
</P>
<P>
   GAME MACHINES _ No new ones this year. Sony and Nintendo are
sitting tight with their consoles. The PC standard for gaming has
stabilized with the Pentium II and a 3DFX graphics accelerator
card. That is a good thing for consumers and developers alike
because people get to catch their breath and concentrate on great
games instead of racing to catch up with the hardware.
</P>
<P>
   Sega is coming out with a new machine for Christmas 1999 that
promises the moon _ superfast graphics, multiplayer online games,
e-mail, chat, 3-D audio and a Windows CE operating system (and
breakfast in bed?) _ for less than $300, but for now, we are in the
eye of the technological hurricane. So content is king. Hallelujah.
</P>
<P>
   PERIPHERALS _ Stable platforms have brought dozens of accessory
manufacturers out of the woodwork. It is now possible to buy video
game controllers in every color of the rainbow and hundreds of
ergonomic configurations, like game pads, joysticks, headsets,
gloves and racing wheels. Force feedback _ a tactile sense of
explosions, body blows or the torque of a racetrack through a
controller _ is the cool technology du jour. All the new joysticks
are going to rumble, rattle and throb.
</P>
<P>
   More significant in the grand scheme is a new crop of video game
storage devices. Interact's Dex Drive, for instance, hooks into
your PC. Pop a Playstation or Nintendo memory card into the drive
and you can upload game saves, characters or sports rosters to your
computer, then e-mail the data or post it to a Web site. Anyone
else with a Dex Drive can download the information, plug it into a
console and play with your levels, characters or teams, modifying
them or mailing back new ones. At $40 (less than the cost of a
Nintendo game), this peripheral knits together the console, PC and
the Internet in an accessible way and could make game saves and
video game characters as tradable as baseball cards.
</P>
<P>
   Along the same lines, the Sony PDA (personal digital assistant)
is a $30, key-chain-size device that plugs into the Playstation
like a memory card. After downloading game data, the PDA converts
into a portable gaming device. It has a calendar and a clock as
well as an infrared transmitter that lets you beam data _ words,
symbols and animations as well as game information _ across the
room to other PDAs. You can transfer secret moves, trade weapons,
play head to head and pass notes to your friends. This device will
no doubt be the bane of every schoolroom from Seattle to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   WORLD-BUILDING FOR THE LAITY _ It used to be that if you wanted
to build your own levels of a PC game, you had to be a programmer.
No more. A slew of computer games, particularly first-person
shooters, will include built-in point-and-click-level editors that
let you create your own versions of a game by importing geometric
shapes into a void and giving them qualities like size, weight,
hollowness, texture and lighting effects. It's the holodeck, more
or less.
</P>
<P>
   GT Interactive's Unreal and Sierra Studio's Half-Life are
standouts in this respect, allowing players to create their own
game worlds and distribute them on the Internet or play them on
line. Building these worlds becomes a game in itself _ perhaps a
more rewarding pastime than the original code (witness the
sprawling virtual community of amateur Doom designers).
</P>
<P>
   ARTIFICIAL LIFE _ Bad news for grown-ups: the virtual pet is not
a passing fad.
</P>
<P>
   Digital creatures are only getting stronger, more numerous and
more sophisticated. From monster-breeding combat games to
Cyberlife's sequel to Creatures, virtual vermin abound. Nintendo is
releasing its own menagerie this fall. They're called Pokemon (a
portmanteau word derived from ``pocket'' and ``monster''). They
live on your belt loop and come in 150 flavors, each with its own
plush doll counterpart. Tamagotchi meets Beanie Babies. Be very
afraid.
</P>
<P>
   THE S-WORD _ After Silicon Valley's disastrous first date with
Hollywood, synergy is back. Fox Interactive is trotting out a
series of showbiz titles _ Alien vs. Predator, an X-Files game, Die
Hard Interactive and the Simpsons' Virtual Springfield. Activision
is transforming ``The Fifth Element'' into a console game. GT
Interactive is bringing ``Beavis and Butt-head'' to the PC and the
Playstation. Acclaim is tackling ``South Park,'' and MGM is
animating James Bond in Tomorrow Never Dies. Movie-based games have
usually been stinkers, but this time around, developers have used
the silver screen as a springboard instead of a crutch. They're
finally getting it right. Chalk one up for the media empires.
</P>
<P>
   THE SCOTS! _ An economic development agency financed by the
Scottish government has determined that video games represent a new
engine for economic growth, so scores of computer science grads and
art school students are being funneled into interactive
entertainment. The result? A convention hall teeming with game
designers in kilts. Bagpipes on the concourse. Interactive
renditions of ``Braveheart.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The object of the game is to become the king of Scotland,''
said Wai Ming Yuen, the Glaswegian producer of Tartan Armies, a
strategy game based on 13th-century clan warfare. ``And then you
get to invade England.''
</P>
<P>
   FEMALE PROTAGONISTS _ From Lara Croft to the trash-talking,
gunslinging truck-stop waitress in Panasonic's Space Bunnies Must
Die and the heroine of Square Soft's epic Parasite Eve, female game
characters are shooting first and asking questions later.
</P>
<P>
   As one game designer so eloquently put it, ``There's something
about a chick with a gun.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Despite Lawrence Selman's having, as he puts it,
``one of the last of the Brooklyn accents,'' his one wish in life
is to live and die at 106 Bedford St., in Greenwich Village in New
York. Selman lives there now, in a one-room apartment with his dog,
Happy, and his cats, Suzy and Lucky. He has lived there for 27
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If God wants me to live another 20 years, I'm going to stay
here, on Bedford Street,'' Selman, 56, said, sitting on the steep
short stoop of his friend Alice Elliot's house across the way at
107 Bedford St., one of a historic row of five Greek Revival
houses.
</P>
<P>
   If streets are veins, residents like Selman are their blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's community,'' said Selman, who rarely searches for the
right words _ they seem instead to find him. ``Other areas are not
a community. Neighbors aren't neighborly. Here, it's neighborly.''
</P>
<P>
   Selman has been called ``the mayor of Bedford Street'' by his
neighbors, who are creating a trust to keep him where he wants to
be _ and where they believe he belongs.
</P>
<P>
   Selman has a New Yorker's problems. He struggles with his rent.
He is often lonely. He also has problems of his own. He is
developmentally disabled. He receives monthly federal disability
payments, which are his income.
</P>
<P>
   Like a single-minded family, Selman's Bedford Street neighbors
and other members of the Bedford Barrow Commerce Block Association
are establishing a community trust, to be administered by
UJA-Federation of New York. By creating a fund that will dispense
payments for quality-of-life uses like clothing, meals, baseball
tickets and veterinary care for Selman's animals, the trust will
strengthen his ability to continue living independently in his own
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   A personal advocate, assigned by the trust to Selman for his
life, will also insure that he receives appropriate payments from
government programs.
</P>
<P>
   Morton Asch, the UJA-Federation senior development executive
working with the Bedford Street group, considers the neighbors'
coalition a precedent for the organization's trust program, which
was designed to assist family members.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interest these folks have taken in this gentleman _ he's
got to be a very special guy,'' Asch said.
</P>
<P>
   He is. Selman knows his neighborhood. He is like a chamber of
commerce map that revises itself each day as he walks Happy.
</P>
<P>
   Selman knows the local businesses, from Lilac Chocolates on
Christopher Street, where he has been blacklisted from buying
chocolates because he is diabetic, to the Hudson Diner at the
corner of Grove Street, where he orders _ and recommends _ the
flounder.
</P>
<P>
   He sells raffle tickets and solicits prizes for the Bedford
Barrow Commerce Block Association street fair, which took place
last month and at which, as usual, Selman held informal court. Last
year, he was the largest individual solicitor of funds for muscular
dystrophy in the metropolitan area. At Christmas, he plays Santa.
</P>
<P>
   In Albany last week, Selman was introduced on the floor of the
state Assembly as part of the proceedings for passage of three
disability-related bills, and he was presented with a citation for
his service to the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't meet Larry without him asking a question about you _
he's a curious, generous, outgoing person,'' said Ms. Elliot, who
is making a documentary film about Selman and who initiated the
trust effort. ``There are a lot of high-functioning people in our
neighborhood, with high-powered, challenging jobs. Here's a person
who can't work, who has an intuitive sense of community, and he
teaches us,'' Ms. Elliot said. ``That you have to know your
neighbors, that you ask questions about the little things in life:
`How's your dog?' `When's your daughter's birthday?' That those
seemingly trivial things build community.''
</P>
<P>
   However far from full adult mental development Selman may be,
experience has provided him an extreme kind of intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Selman was born weighing just over three pounds and was not
expected to live. An only child, he lived with his parents, Philip
and Minnie Selman, in Brooklyn until 1968, when both died, four
months apart, in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   Selman had a nervous breakdown. He was hospitalized for two
months. On his release, he lived briefly in a small Brooklyn
apartment he rented, and then, at the suggestion of a neighbor, he
moved to Coney Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like jumping from the pan into the fire,'' Selman said.
``The landlord took advantage of me. People see they can take
advantage _ they do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Selman's closest surviving relative, an uncle, Murray Schaul,
found him an apartment, near his own, at 106 Bedford St.
</P>
<P>
   Because of what his neighbors agree is the force of Selman's
personality, he has forged a bond with the neighborhood that has
fostered a two-sided adoption.
</P>
<P>
   By arrangement with his neighbors in the five historic houses,
Selman superintends the buildings, organizing recycling bins and
garbage removal on appropriate days. With the help of Schaul, who
brings him meals three times a week, he keeps the street swept and
cleans the debris from the parties that descend on Greenwich
Village each weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look after the houses, to make sure they're OK,'' Selman
said. ``If I see people who don't belong here, I try to chase them
off, but they give me lip,'' he added. In exchange, those in the
five houses and members of the block association beyond have
provided him services as friends and professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Lanes, a radiologist who moved into 115 Bedford St. last
year with his wife, Susan Wyland, an executive for the online
division of Walt Disney, helps Selman check his blood sugar once a
week.
</P>
<P>
   Sally Dill, an artist who lives at 88 Bedford St., accompanies
Selman to a dental clinic, ``to give him moral support,'' she said.
She put drops in his ear when he had an ear infection.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Steele, at 48 Commerce St., takes in baseball games with
Selman from seats between home plate and third base at Shea
Stadium, where Selman can keep an eye on the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an incredible Mets fan,'' Steele said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to 15 or 16 games,'' Selman said. ``In the loge, but I
get the cheap seats. I know the guys at Shea, Pat and Al.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight months ago, Ms. Elliot realized that the neighborhood's
relationship with Selman had deepened into responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Murray is aging,'' Ms. Elliot said of Selman's uncle, who is
82. ``I realized how much Larry depended on Murray.''
</P>
<P>
   The trust, to be made final on June 24 at a block association
meeting, is to be used as needed when Selman's uncle can no longer
help care for him. A $25,000 minimum balance to establish the trust
must be met with pledges, many of which have already been made;
$5,000 has been raised for the assignment of an advocate for
Selman.
</P>
<P>
   If concern for Selman has galvanized the community, his life is
something that sits at the center of every village _ a lightning
rod, that has attracted both good and bad, in bright flashes. Grief
and charity have been just two bolts in the sky. When he was 18, he
and his father were called out as air wardens to control the crowds
that mobbed the scene when a TWA flight from Ohio collided in
midair with a United Airlines jet that fell in Brooklyn, killing
128 on board and 6 on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   At 26, released to the frightening company of neighbors after
his hospitalization, Selman rode all night with the Fire Department
because he didn't want to go home.
</P>
<P>
   When he was 40, his best friend, a neighbor on Bedford Street,
was stabbed to death in her apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friend Peggy lived across the street, and she looked after
me,'' Selman recalled. ``But she got murdered. They took me in for
questioning, because I had a key,'' he said. He looked after her
houseplants.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Selman's Bedford Street neighbors find themselves part of
his story, which is taking another turn, like a wheel.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we're trying to do is pay back,'' Steele said. ``We all
live and work next to each other. But most of us don't reach out
the way he does. He's kind of the glue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They talk about the Midwest,'' Sally Dill said on the subject
of small-town values. ``Well, I lived 51 years in the Midwest and
I've never seen anything like this. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ A smile. It's the only possible response to trompe
l'oeil designs and photo images on shower curtains, bed sheets,
even end tables. The designs are contemporary sisters to those by
Piero Fornasetti, the Milanese decorative master of trompe l'oeil.
</P>
<P>
   Renewed interest in his work (which peaked in the 1950s) was
apparent at the May 16 auction of 203 of his designs at Christie's
in Los Angeles; the bureaus, dinner plates, magazine racks and
hand-painted bathroom fixtures sold for record-breaking prices _
sometimes five times the estimates. Fornasetti transferred
engravings that tricked the eye and tickled the imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Contemporary versions of the technique include the following:
</P>
<P>
   _ A moss-green cotton velvet pillow cover is patterned with a
hand-screened photo image of a sunflower by Jan Milne of Glasgow.
The down-filled cushion, 20 inches square, reverses to silk; $225
in several colors at Salon Moderne, 281 Lafayette St. (Prince
Street).
</P>
<P>
   _ Phototransparencies of rocks form a translucent surface for a
nest of blackened-steel-legged tables by the photographer Amanda
Weil. The limited-edition tables can also be ordered with images
like flowers or water. The nest of three tables, the largest 17
inches square, is $2,000 from Weil Studio, 34 Renwick St. (Spring
Street).
</P>
<P>
   _ Weatherproof lampshades on a string of lights with photos of
leaves are $45 from Smith &AMP; Hawken, (800) 776-3336.
</P>
<P>
   _ Images on Bloom pillowcases, shams and duvet covers were
adapted from old botanical engravings. The 300-thread-count fabric,
by Bonjour of Switzerland, is 100 percent cotton sateen. A pair of
pillowcases is $150, a duvet cover that reverses to a solid-color
sateen is $300 for a twin, $350 for a full/queen and $400 for a
king. To order from Harris Levy, 278 Grand St. (Eldridge Street).
</P>
<P>
   _ A cork-backed place mat with a photograph of artichokes is $24
at Ad Hoc Softwares, 410 West Broadway (Spring Street).
</P>
<P>
   _ An 8-inch drum-style shade of ``Little Lamp'' is a
phototransparency of dogwood blossoms. A 20-inch-tall table lamp
with shade (also available in rocks, pears or fern leaves) is $300
from Weil Studio.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Meadow,'' a plastic shower curtain by Waterware, looks like
a lush green lawn but never needs mowing; $24.99 at Bed, Bath and
Beyond, (800) 462-3966.
</P>
<P>
   _ The lavender cotton velvet slipcover on a slipper chair has a
photographic image of a daisy on its seat and back. Ms. Milne's

<P>
   Concerned that children have easy access to pornography and
other inappropriate material on the Internet, the American Family
Association, a conservative, Christian group, has been a vocal
supporter of filtering products, software meant to cordon off the
nastier corners of cyberspace from users, especially young
children.
</P>
<P>
   So it was with some surprise that officials at the group
recently discovered that their association's own Web pages were
being lumped together with skinhead, white supremacist and other
``intolerant'' sites blocked by a popular filter called Cyber
Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   The AFA Web site ran into trouble with Cyber Patrol because
researchers at the company decided it met the filter's definition
of intolerance, which includes discrimination based on sexual
orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of the passages Cyber Patrol found offensive, according
to Casey M. Smith Jr., executive assistant at the AFA, based in
Tupelo, Miss., was the following: ``Every time our young people
hear about a `gay' pride event or `coming out' celebration, they
become less sensitive to the perversity of homosexuality and more
likely to experiment with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith concedes that these words are strong stuff. But, he says,
they are delivered in the context of the group's belief that God
loves all and are not akin to Neo-Nazi or Ku Klux Klan-type
virulence.
</P>
<P>
   Association officials insist that their viewpoint is a
deeply-held religious conviction that does not equate to preaching
hatred of homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   The group asked cyber patrol's ``oversight committee'' to remove
the block, but by a majority vote tuesday night, the committee
voted to keep the gate up, at least for now. The committee also
decided to take another look at the AFA site in a month and to
review other pro- and anti-gay web sites to see if they meet the
filter's ``intolerance'' definition.
</P>
<P>
   Cyber Patrol bans up to 12 categories of material considered
inappropriate for the typical 12-year-old surfing without an adult,
from gambling to cult Web sites. But customers can pick and choose
which categories to block, as well as unlock access to individual
sites they consider acceptable, according to Susan Getgood,
spokeswoman for The Learning Company Inc., the Cambridge, Mass.
educational software firm that makes Cyber Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   And, she notes, in Cyber Patrol's case online publishers who
believe their sites have been unfairly blocked can take the route
of the AFA and appeal the decision to an independent panel that
includes educators, parents and representatives of groups as
diverse as the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation and the
conservative group, Morality in Media.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime opponents of filters, who view the products as clumsy
high-tech censors, are savoring the irony of the dispute. ``This is
yet another illustration of how badly the filtering concept can be
applied, even coming back to bite proponents of that approach,''
said David L. Sobel, general counsel for the Electronic Privacy
Information Center, a Washington, D.C.-based group advocating civil
liberties on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of filters respond that the flap in no way undermines
their belief in the necessity of the products to help parents
shield the young from what they view as pernicious influences
online.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Cyber Patrol chooses to leave our site blocked, it will be
unfortunate, but it will not change our viewpoint about the need
for filtering on the World Wide Web,'' Smith said before the vote.
He called filtering ``an absolute must.'' Wednesday morning, he
stood by his comments.

LANGUAGE CALLED JAVA TRANSCENDS BARRIERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By JIM MCMANUS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a familiar name with many meanings: an ancient kingdom in
what is now Indonesia, slang for a cup of coffee and one of the
most important developments in the short life span of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Java, a programming language for applications used on networks,
is being heralded, at least by Scott McNealy, chairman of Sun
Microsystems, which developed and licenses Java as the next great
thing, ready to change the nature of computing.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is quite so optimistic, but Java's growth and
success so far is clear. Created in 1991 by James Gosling and his
associates at Sun Microsystems, Java (originally called Oak, after
a tree outside Gosling's window) began as part of an effort to make
a consumer-oriented home control unit (a device to start the coffee
in the morning, regulate the temperature in the house, operate the
VCR, etc.). The device never took off, but the ascendance of the
Internet three years later opened unforeseen channels for Sun's new
language.
</P>
<P>
   Most often associated with the whirring and spinning elements on
a favorite Web page, Java has uses far beyond that. It has become
ubiquitous to the point that its name is no longer just a noun but
also an adjective used to describe all sorts of devices, virtual
and physical, McNealy said at a recent conference at Harvard
University.
</P>
<P>
   What distinguishes Java from other major programming languages
is that applications, or programs, written in Java can run on any
computer operating system, be it Windows, Mac OS or Unix.
Applications written in Java are some of the most advanced ways to
take advantage of computer networks. The Java programming on your
computer goes out to the Internet to retrieve bits of computer code
from other computers to do specific tasks. Applications of the new
language range from the grand (Home Depot uses Java-based
applications to track inventory across its 560 stores) to the minor
(the various flashing advertisements on innumerable Web pages are
small programs written in Java known as applets). And as networks
become more sophisticated and allow more data to be carried more
quickly, Java-related applications will become more commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, reliance on a network does have its limitations.
As Rob Currie, vice president of engineering at Marimba, a company
that develops business applications using Java-based programming,
said, ``When you're connected, great,'' but when you're not, ``then
you really want the whole program there with you.''

GAMES ADD FUN TO SUMMER MATH PRACTICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 (jt)  
 By ALICE KEIM    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As summer approaches and the school year ends, my students are
anticipating their time away from school. While they may miss their
friends, it would be rare for any child to spend the summer months
dreaming about math class.
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean that the next three months need to be devoid
of academics. A little practice during the break can make next year
easier. Educational computer programs are a good way to integrate
academics into your child's summer, especially during rainy days
and quiet times. Math programs are a good place to start.
</P>
<P>
   My own students, in the third through sixth grades, are as
likely to play a well-designed math game during their free time in
school as they are a nonacademic program. As long as the program is
fun, children do not think of it as just work. And with more and
more quality software available, parents can make sure that their
children's computer time is active brain time.
</P>
<P>
   There are a couple of considerations when looking for software
for your child, but there are no strict rules. Most math software,
for example, presents questions a child must answer correctly to
advance in the program. But it is the program's design and bells
and whistles that will decide whether a child plays the game in the
first place. The most important thing is whether your child enjoys
the program. Is the format appealing? Is your child engaged with
the characters? Are the games engaging?
</P>
<P>
   Education researchers who have studied software have found that
young children (through third grade) tend to respond better to
programs that use women's voices, that students usually prefer
characters they can relate to and that a program should take into
account children's attention spans. In addition, experts know that
programs should encourage children, even when they make mistakes.
We also know that children benefit from repetition of instruction
and rules; if something is spoken in the program, it should also
appear in writing to reinforce the concept.
</P>
<P>
   I have encountered these guidelines as part of my academic
studies, but my classroom teaching experience has provided me with
real insights. When I first looked at Math Munchers, for example, I
thought that students would lose interest because of the lack of
diverse activities. I also thought the commercial-break spoofs
would annoy my fourth- through sixth-grade students and entertain
the younger ones. I was wrong on most counts. My older students
laughed at the commercials. The pop-culture references hit a chord
with them. The program's repetitive assignments did not bother them
because the math tests became progressively more demanding. And to
my surprise, the younger students did not take to Math Munchers at
all. The pop-culture references were over their heads. They did not
like the fast-paced game atmosphere, preferring the softer
environment of a program like Math Splash.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, too, that while some of these programs are very good
at reinforcing math skills learned elsewhere, few, if any, teach
new skills. If a program claims, as Number Maze does, that by using
the program ``whole-number math skills are learned and practiced,''
it is fair to be somewhat suspicious of the first claim. These
programs provide an outlet and environment to practice skills but
they are not a substitute for traditional education.
</P>
<P>
   The four programs reviewed here reach a balance between
entertaining and reinforcing math skills. That combination, if done
right, can keep a child's attention.
</P>
<P>
   Solving the Maze Challenge
</P>
<P>
   NUMBER MAZE CHALLENGE
</P>
<P>
   (Great Wave Software; $49.95; Windows 3.1 and 95, Macintosh.)
</P>
<P>
   NUMBER MAZE CHALLENGE is the newest version of the classic
Number Maze program from Great Wave Software. It does a remarkable
job of providing a fun and rather enthralling environment for
students to practice their skills and an impressive range of math
problems for different ages. But even though Great Wave recommends
this program for children 5 to 12 years old, the presentation of
Number Maze does not always get more sophisticated as the questions
get harder.
</P>
<P>
   Users make their way through mazes by solving math problems. At
certain junctures, students have the opportunity to solve problems
that allow them to pick up keys or books that open locked doors and
permit them to keep moving through the maze. The program lets
students choose how to navigate through the mazes, using a
two-dimensional or three-dimensional map.
</P>
<P>
   Number Maze is essentially a drill program enhanced with clever
graphics, but it does offer limited mathematical instruction. As
each new concept is introduced, a tutorial explains the method of
calculation. An animated character narrates an explanation and
graphics illustrate the problem. The graphics help explain the
function but may require an adult's assistance to be understood.
The tutorials are only spoken, not spoken and written, so they may
prove difficult for early learners.
</P>
<P>
   Great Wave says its maze can be customized for children in
kindergarten through sixth grade, but I found that some aspects of
the presentation would have a narrower appeal. The math levels
covered, however, roughly correspond to these grade and skill
levels. Unfortunately, the instructions and tutorials, which tend
to be repetitive and didactic, cannot be bypassed and are likely to
discourage older users.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge of finishing the maze, however, should keep upper
elementary and early middle school students hooked. My students
loved the graphics of this program, but younger students, through
second grade, found that they ended up bumping into a lot of walls
while trying to reach a maze opening. The higher-level math
problems require long division and some complex word problems that
even some adults may find a challenge. Older children will also
enjoy the ability to choose three levels of intricacy for each
maze.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the many options that customize the maze and math
levels, Number Maze provides good assessment and tracking tools.
These allow you to evaluate both the degree of difficulty completed
and the areas where practice is needed.
</P>
<P>
   Number Play for the Young
</P>
<P>
   STICKYBEAR'S MATH SPLASH (Optimum Resource; $59.95; Windows 3.1
and 95, Macintosh.)
</P>
<P>
   For young math students, even preschoolers, it does not get much
more fun than this. Sticky-bear's Math Splash offers primary
students several exciting game and adventure areas to practice
their skills.
</P>
<P>
   The program's principal character is Bumper, an animated brown
bear who is spending the day at a water park with his family.
Bumper has four places to explore, each offering math challenges.
In one game, a pirate bear sits on a ship, ready to be dunked by
the player. As the student solves each group of problems, the
reward is a cannonball. Once the student has collected five balls,
it is time to shoot them at a swinging pendulum. If the child hits
the target, the pirate bear is dunked.
</P>
<P>
   In another activity area, the user enters a submarine. Sea
creatures swim by the submarine's window, offering answers to the
math question on the screen. The student earns points by choosing
the right answer.
</P>
<P>
   Each correct answer also earns the child a verbal pat on the
back from the characters. Comments like ``You're a brainiac''
brought repeated smiles to my third graders' faces. Incorrect
answers are accompanied by positive encouragement and the correct
answer. Children are not, however, given second chances.

YEAR 2000 COMPUTER GLITCH COULD THREATEN MILLIONS OF INVESTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Filed in ``w'' and ``f'' categories)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Financial experts warned Wednesday that the
possible Year 2000 computer glitch could threaten the safety of
billions of dollars in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   While corporations and government agencies are spending tens of
billions of dollars to solve the problem, investors still do not
know if those organizations are devoting enough time and resources
to fix the potential computer bug before Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors need to know if their stocks will have value,'' Sen.
Robert Bennett, R-Utah, said at a Senate banking subcommittee
hearing on the impact of the Year 2000 problem on the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett announced at the hearing that he has introduced
legislation that would require companies to make specific
disclosures about what they have done to solve the problem and what
work they have left to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The millions of people out there putting their money into
these companies have a right to know if they're prepared or not,
and those companies have an obligation to tell them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Computer experts warn that many computers originally programmed
to recognize only the last two digits of a year will fail or
malfunction on Jan. 1, 2000, when the machines will assume it is
1900.
</P>
<P>
   Under this theory, the impact of the glitch would be felt when
one computer system that thinks the year is 1900 interacts with
another computer system that thinks the year is 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The theory continues: Because computers can't think, neither
system can understand why it is 99 years ahead or behind. Unable to
sort out the problem, the two systems would either stop or give out
wrong information.
</P>
<P>
   Some computers can be reprogrammed through tedious review of
their software code, but many devices have embedded microchips that
must be physically replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Yardeni, chief economist for the North American division
of the investment firm Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, said the potential
computer failures could prove devastating for many companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way things stand, there's a good chance the Year 2000
problem will cause a recession about the size we saw in 1973 and
1974 when the Middle East cut off our oil,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett described how the glitch could impact even a company
that had its computers fixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens when a company that relies on just-in-time
delivery wakes up and discovers the trains aren't running to bring
them their supplies? Or when their supplier is shut down because of
Year 2000? Or when many of the firms that used to buy the company's
products can't anymore because their factories are shut down?'' he
asked.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``That's not even mentioning the problems a company
could have with basic things like using a telephone or trying to
make a financial transaction or even if the water is still running,
all of which could be affected by Year 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven L. Hock, president of Triaxsys Research Corp. of
Missoula, Mont., a consulting firm, said that nearly half of the
nation's 250 largest companies have disclosed no information on
their Year 2000 problem.
</P>
<P>
   Of the companies that did provide some disclosure, most of the
information was so sketchy that it gave no clue as to where the
firms were in solving the problem, Hock said.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 10 companies gave specific details on their progress
toward fixing or replacing bad computer systems and predicted
whether they would be ready by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we just don't know which companies are at risk, and
neither do investors,'' Hock said.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that Congress require all companies to answer a
standardized set of specific questions on their plans for fixing
the Year 2000 problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The questions need to be extremely detailed, so companies
don't have any room to write around the truth,'' Hock said.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Stout, a professor of securities law at Georgetown
University, said companies would continue to avoid giving full
information unless they are forced to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, companies are afraid that telling the truth will
scare away investors or tip off their competition, so they don't do
it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (STORY COULD END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Bennett's legislation would require a
company to:
</P>
<P>
   _ Tell what it is doing to fix the Year 2000 problem;
</P>
<P>
   _ Disclose a summary of all costs already incurred in solving
the potential glitch and how much more money the company expects to
spend;
</P>
<P>
   _ Provide an estimate of expected litigation costs from Year
2000 problems;
</P>
<P>
   _ Report whether the firm is insured for the problem and how
much it is costing;
</P>
<P>
   _ Disclose whether the company has contingency plans to ensure
continued operations in the event of a Year 2000 computer failure.

 UNDATED: second chances.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For kids who love carnivals and fairs, the Rapid Fire section is
a friendly place (despite the name) to practice math. The user
picks one of several water pistols shaped like a shark's mouth.
Instead of pulling the trigger, the user answers math questions to
shoot through to the finish line. There are other sharks in the
race, so winning is not guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   The areas that include shooting resemble carnival games and are
not violent. Each activity environment contains many hidden treats
and secrets. For example, if you click on the pelican sitting to
the side of the boat in Overboard, it will try to catch a flying
fish.
</P>
<P>
   The publisher recommends this program for children 5 to 10. That
seems fairly accurate although some preschool children may also
enjoy this program, depending on their math skills. The younger
players would especially benefit from having an adult play with
them. While the math levels are appropriate for children at various
levels, the characters and activities may grow tiresome for upper
elementary students. I found that this program appealed more to my
younger students, particularly the girls. The program ``makes math
fun and lets me think and stuff,'' one of my third-graders said.
</P>
<P>
   Math Drills That Imitate Video Games
</P>
<P>
   MATH MUNCHERS DELUXE
</P>
<P>
   (The Learning Co.; sold as part of Mega Munchers package,
$39.95; Windows 3.1 and 95, Macintosh.)
</P>
<P>
   Math Munchers Deluxe is a program for the child raised on MTV
and arcade games. An animated green monster called the Muncher is
drawn into a television screen at the beginning of a fictional game
show. The student player is challenged to help him answer the
questions on a game-show number board. When the student completes
each board, the Muncher rejoices and moves to a harder screen.
</P>
<P>
   The program, designed for children in grades two through six,
allows a child to practice specific math skills. For example, one
area, recommended for sixth graders, reinforces the idea of prime
numbers. Two on-screen potato-head announcers give the
instructions, ``Say, can you munch those primes?'' Different
numbers are on each of the board's 20 squares as the student moves
the Muncher to all the squares with prime numbers.
</P>
<P>
   While completing this essentially simple task, the student must
also avoid the menacing Troggle characters, which come in various
forms, like a flying spider and a walking piece of toast. If your
child answers incorrectly or is eaten too many times, the game
ends. After three screens are cleared, there is a Muncher
commercial (which can be skipped) to offer a break.
</P>
<P>
   While this is the simplest of the programs reviewed, my students
love this game, even though the younger children seem to play for
only short periods. One of my early elementary students said the
program was too easy and did not have enough different activities.
</P>
<P>
   The program provides an opportunity to practice skills already
taught. Parents can adjust the level of difficulty, as can most
children. Math Munchers Deluxe has the appeal of a video game while
relying on tried and true math drill techniques.

   Trolls Help Dress Up Math
</P>
<P>
   MATH BLASTER: AGES 6 TO 9
</P>
<P>
   (Davidson; $30; Windows 3.1 and 95, Macintosh.)
</P>
<P>
   Math Blaster is a favorite among kids, and no wonder. This
exciting program is essentially a space rescue adventure. The
heroes are Blasternaut and the Galactic Commander. The villain,
Gelator, also known as the Brain Drainer, has kidnapped Spot,
Blasternaut's droid friend. It is the student's job to help
Blasternaut and the Galactic Commander find three magic energy
crystals and use them to weaken the Brain Drainer's powers and
rescue Spot.
</P>
<P>
   Sound complicated? It is. There is a lot to keep track of: evil
trolls to be conquered, crystals to win and math problems to solve.
The problems appear in gooey drips from the roof of a cave, in
space pods, in a giant generator and in the control panel inside a
space ship.
</P>
<P>
   To conquer the enemy, the student must use clothespins,
pacifiers and banana peels. The details keep the game interesting
and exciting while simultaneously providing a slightly overwhelming
game environment.
</P>
<P>
   Math Blaster is very likely to become addictive once the child
has learned when to use the mouse, keyboard and arrows to direct
the game. The main character, Blasternaut, is childlike and easy to
relate to. The game progresses at a fast pace, keeping the child
involved and interested. At each level, there is voice instruction
and a help menu, but parents are more likely to understand the help
offered. Progress reports can be printed, creating a clear sense of
progress at every level.
</P>
<P>
   The game presents a diverse set of math skills to be practiced.
There is also some room for parental control of the different
difficulty levels and subjects. And a Math Tips component provides
a number line and number grid to help solve and understand
problems. While this section is likely to be confusing to young
children, parents and teachers can use it to explain mathematical
concepts. They can even import their own data for problems if they
feel ambitious.
</P>
<P>
   This Math Blaster program is recommended for ages 6 to 9 (Math
Blaster is also available for ages 9 to 12). The program is
entertaining and enticing, providing an excellent environment for
practice, but I would strongly encourage adults to help explain the
game.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ As every voyeur clutching a ticket and a dream knows,
designer show houses are typically celebrations of the perfection
that money can buy. More often than not in these open-to-the-public
alliances of charity fund-raising and design-industry public
relations, sumptuous taffetas shadow windows, kitchen cabinets
flaunt labor-intensive hand-painted finishes, and there is always a
room where the cost of one of the antiques would finance an Ivy
League education.
</P>
<P>
   So it came as a pleasant surprise last Friday night when the
Harlem United Show House opened its wood-and-glass front door to a
soundtrack of furious hammer blows and furniture being dragged into
position.
</P>
<P>
   Fastidious show house devotees might have deemed the evening's
gala party a bit premature, but the 24 designers, their friends,
clients and well-wishers gamely put a cheery spin on the chaos
around them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a little crazy about the situation, but we decided to
make it into a positive,'' said Joan Gibbs, an interior designer
whose entrance hall was an environmental album to African-American
creativity, from photographs by James Van Der Zee to 19th-century
furniture made by largely unrecognized black cabinetmakers who
worked in Louisiana, Missouri and North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the people who came had never seen a designer at
work,'' continued Ms. Gibbs, who admitted she would probably keep
tinkering with her space for a few more weeks. ``They had only ever
seen the finished product in a magazine. But this was something
different. It gave everyone an opportunity to ask questions about
how the painting was being done, things like that. It was a
wonderful experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Women clad in sequins and sky-high stilettos gingerly clutched
wobbling banisters as they climbed to the top of the four-story
Edwardian town house at 459 W. 141 St., between Convent and
Amsterdam Avenues. Dressed in black tie, their escorts brushed
plaster dust from their shoulders as Alma Nugent shrugged at the
electrical wires coiling around her feet and calmly explained what
her second-floor landing would eventually look like.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the loose ends and atmosphere of resigned improvisation,
the Harlem United Show House, which runs through July 3, is a
revelation. Not only for its good natured jousting against the odds
_ after all, who knew it would take eight weeks to strip seven
layers of paint from all the woodwork and install new plumbing and
electrical systems _ but for the window it opens on New York City's
African-American design community.
</P>
<P>
   Of the two dozen participating interior and landscape designers,
all but two are black. And not one of them bears a name that would
be familiar to the readers of any of the leading American
interior-design publications.
</P>
<P>
   Spearheaded by Roderick Shade, a Manhattan designer who noted
that another organization's attempt to stage an African-American
show house last year fell apart over production difficulties, the
Harlem United Show House bills itself as America's first
African-American show house. It is not the last, however: two
others are scheduled to open this fall. In September, a benefit for
the United Negro College Fund will be staged in the opulent
Irvington-on-Hudson home of the turn-of-the-century beauty expert
Madame C.J. Walker, whose hair-straightening formula made her
America's first black millionaire.
</P>
<P>
   The Harlem show house, which benefits the Harlem United
Community AIDS Center, is located in another black landmark. Built
in 1906 for a white merchant, the four-story limestone and brick
town house was once the home of Charles Blackwell, a black dancer,
writer and stage manager whose credits included ``Sunday in the
Park With George'' and ``The Tap-Dance Kid.'' Blackwell's widow,
Frances, loaned part of the couple's collection of African statues
for use in the Harlem show house dining room, decorated by Gail
Green and Cheryl Flanagan.
</P>
<P>
   Those skeptics might question the wisdom of racially-focused
design expos like the Harlem United Show House, its participants
are comfortable with the distinction _ for the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't doing this to segregate ourselves from the rest of
the design community but to make people aware that we are here,
that we have our own offices and companies,'' said Alma Nugent,
whose clients include the family of Reginald Lewis, the late
leveraged-buyout mogul who orchestrated the takeover of Beatrice
Foods, and Ron Sweeney, a senior vice president of Sony Music. ``We
don't want to be just black designers, but merely designers who
happen to be black.''
</P>
<P>
   To achieve that goal, however, has taken a a long time in the
white-dominated American design world. While designers and
architects from minority backgrounds have become celebrated in
recent years, like the Hispanic-Americans Vicente Wolf, Orlando
Diaz-Azcuy and Juan Montoya, precious few of their black
contemporaries have achieved wide national recognition.
</P>
<P>
   In the 26-year-history of the Kips Bay show house, for example,
only three black designers have ever been asked to participate:
Conchita Legendre, Rita Falkner and Robert S. Hart, said Kips Bay
chairman Harry Hinson. And only recently, thanks to the surge of
interest in Southern furniture of the 18th and 19th centuries,
spurred by studies at Colonial Williamsburg, have the contributions
of African-American craftsmen won the attention of scholars and
collectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to draw on a tradition that we're part of, too,''
said Joan Gibbs, who anchored the entrance hall with antiques
created by black craftsmen in the 1800s and then arranged to have
them reproduced for retail customers.
</P>
<P>
   Among the pieces are a humble ladder-back chair made by William
Kunze, a Missouri slave; a luxurious 1850s mahogany day bed from
the New Orleans workshop of Pierre-Charles Dutreuil Barjon, a
Haitian immigrant, and a sober American Empire oak side chair by
Thomas Day, a North Carolina cabinetmaker active in the 1870s.
Prices for Ms. Gibb's reproductions will range, she said, from
$1,500 for a Day side chair to $7,000 for a Barjon day bed with
oversize scroll feet.
</P>
<P>
   Black culture was an obvious springboard for the show house, but
many of the designers stretched the obvious into the universally
appealing. A hypnotic lava-like pattern of flowing orange and
brown, the mural that Selma Jackson and Brenda Brunson-Bay created
to wrap the four-story service stair took its inspiration from the
mud huts colorfully painted by the women of South Africa's Ndebele
tribe. ``It's not exact,'' said Ms. Brunson-Bay, whose
interpretation of the patterns seems to owe as much to Peter Max as
to traditional African art.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Black culture of a saucier sort led Wilbert Louis Shaw to
transform his second-floor space into a sincerely garish
super-affordable boudoir, whose second-hand chairs from Scotty's
New &AMP; Used Furniture are covered in cut-rate white bridal satin.
The sheer white curtains are trimmed with inexpensive tear-drop
crystals the size of half dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The inspiration, Shaw said, were Marie Antoinette-style
boiseries _ the fireplace is a scaled-down version of one at
Fontainebleau. ``I wanted to do a room to showcase an African
American associated with Europe,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Robeson came immediately to mind, but Shaw nixed that idea
as geographically inexact, not to mention politically
controversial. ``He's Russia, not France.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the designer settled on the expatriate black
chanteuse, Josephine Baker, whose joie-de-vivre proved a lot more
fun to channel. In honor of Baker's famously abbreviated
professional outfits, many nothing more than a feather
strategically placed, Shaw scattered his room with avian accents,
from an 1860s birdcage to crystal sconces shaped like ostrich
plumes. Even the air twittered, thanks to a cassette tape of Baker
singing cabaret tunes.
</P>
<P>
   The second-floor media room, a show house debut of Manhattan
designers Leyden Lewis and Catherine Kim, got the lion's ahre of
attention on opening night, thanks in part to its piece de
resistance: a Fuji plasma screen television, almost as thin as a
billfold (and given the price, not a bad comparison) suspended from
the ceiling by a horseshoe-shaped armature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Work like this is bound to get them into Kips Bay,'' said Joan
Regenbogen, who hovered over the space like a proud mother hen, and
for good reason. A Manhattan decorator, she hired Lewis to be an
aide in her office, and was so impressed with his eye and comments
that she urged him to go to the Parsons School of Design. ``He's
got really innovative ideas,'' she said, pointing out that the
room's Constructivist-style patchwork walls were not covered in
grey suede, as many people assumed; they are actually sheathed in
Homosote, a pressed-paper soundproofing material, whose velvety
finish is the result of hand-sanding.
</P>
<P>
   Homosote's special properties came in handy. It effectively
blocked the sound of hammering coming from the kitchen and pantry
below, where representatives of the Design &AMP; Development Group, a
Manhattan firm directing the rooms' renovation were completing the
work of a pro bono contractor who pulled out of the project two
weeks before the show house was to open. A behind-the-scenes
glimpse was promising: a sleek and vaguely nautical chamber with
black granite counters and walls of burl chestnut.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvan Ebanks, a director of D&AMP;DG, described the design as ``a
coccoon'' _ an embracing phrase that was an apt metaphor for the
entire Harlem show house, from its chaotic birth to the hopes that
continues to buouy it to completion. Neighbors who see work being
done _ including one woman from an SRO _ come by to offer help, and
for every sponsor that turned them down, another has stepped in.
</P>
<P>
   Ebanks said that the kitchen would be unveiled Friday, six days
behind schedule, at a cost to the young company of $40,000. But if
it isn't, he and his workers _ indeed the entire show house staff _
can repair to Alma Nugent's meditation chamber on the second floor,
where dozens of votive candles and the peaceful sound of flowing
water await.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all this,'' Ms. Nugent said, ``what we need is a good
long rest.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>

Convent and Amsterdam Avenues), around the corner from Hamilton

WHY ICE CREAM GIVES SOME PEOPLE HEADACHES

   Q. What causes hot flashes?
</P>
<P>
   M.M. Watertown
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The root of the hot flash can be traced to a part of the
brain called the hypothalamus. This portion of the brain is
responsible for many basic life functions: respiration,
circulation, and for keeping the body temperature stable.
</P>
<P>
   Think of the hypothalamus as a thermostat, says Dr. Brian Walsh,
director of the Menopause Center at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   In pre-menopausal women, the thermostat is steady because of the
relatively high levels of estrogen circulating through the body.
But during menopause, when estrogen levels dip, the thermostat
becomes unstable. A man's thermostat will also become unstable,
notes Walsh, when estrogen given him as a medical treatment is
later withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   When estrogen is withdrawn, says Walsh, ``basically you have a
faulty thermostat that's going haywire.''
</P>
<P>
   The thermostat messages the body to cool off. The blood vessels
in the face and chest dilate as the body attempts to give off heat.
Body temperature then falls, and the person who's had the hot flash
feels a chill, says Walsh, an assistant professor of obstetrics and
gynecology at Harvard Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   The thermostat generally stabilizes after a few years, but some
women endure a decade or more of hot flashes. On average, says
Walsh, a woman's last menstrual period occurs at about age 52. Hot
flashes actually begin earlier _ around age of 48 or 49.
</P>
<P>
   This suggests, says Walsh, that if a woman is going to use
estrogen replacement therapy, it should be started while she is
still menstruating.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why do people sometimes get headaches when they eat ice
cream?
</P>
<P>
   R.B. Boston
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Though it's popularly known as an ice cream headache, the
sudden searing pain can be brought on when you eat or drink
anything that's cold.
</P>
<P>
   The headache occurs when a cold substance hits the soft palate
in the back of the roof of the mouth, says Dr. Robert Smith, a
founder of the Cincinnati Headache Center. ``The effects are not
injurious,'' he says, ``but they cause a nasty pain and can
slightly reduce the pleasures of eating ice cream.''
</P>
<P>
   The pain is generally felt around the temples and sometimes
behind the ears or in the esophagus. It usually lasts only 10 to 15
seconds. People who suffer from migraines often report temporary
migraine pain during ice cream headaches, and tension headache
sufferers report their ice cream headaches feel more like ordinary
tension headaches. Headaches of all types _ including the ice cream
one _ are most common among people aged 20 to 40, Smith adds.
</P>
<P>
   Ice cream headaches were first described by Dr. Daniel Drake,
the founder of the University of Cincinnati medical school, in
1850. Nearly 150 years later, their cause is still not precisely
known. But Smith has an educated guess. The nerve receptors in the
palate are sensitive to cold, as well as heat and taste. Those same
nerves are also involved in the constriction and expansion of blood
vessels in the mouth, head, and brain. The cold stimuli in the
mouth may cause blood vessels in the brain to expand _ and that
could be what causes the pain.
</P>
<P>
   A cure? ``Of course, you could avoid ice cream, but who wants to
do that?'' says Smith. Instead, he says, don't eat ice cream in
``big gobs.'' If you do get a sudden sharp pain while munching a
cone, press your tongue against the roof of your mouth to help
reheat the sensitive area.

   Small and Wide-Shade Tree
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a small backyard in East Hampton, N.Y. I'd like to
plant a deciduous tree that will grow no more than 14 to 16 feet
tall but will have a wide canopy and pretty flowers in spring or
perhaps summer. The key is the shape; I'd like it to have a wide
reach and give shade.
</P>
<P>
   A. Since a 15-foot tree's branches will start somewhat closer to
the ground, I assume you don't mind bending low when you go to sit
in its shade. One problem with meeting your requirements is that to
be a tree, you have to look like one, and 20 feet tall is about the
minimum. But there are a few crab apples suggested by Kris
Bachtell, the curator of the collection at the Morton Arboretum in
Lisle, Ill., which has more than 200 species and cultivars of crab
apples.
</P>
<P>
   Malus Weeping Candied Apple grows 15 feet high, with picturesque
horizontal branches 15 to 20 feet wide. Its white flowers, edged in
pink, are followed by bright red fruit.
</P>
<P>
   M. floribunda (Japanese flowering crab apple) is 20 to 25 feet
high and wide, with pale pink, nearly white flowers. Its yellow
fruit, blushed with red, attracts many birds, so watch where you
sit.
</P>
<P>
   M. x zumi calocarpa (redbud crab apple) grows 20 feet high and
25 feet wide. It has pinkish-white flowers and red-orange fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the other two, redbud crab apple is an alternate bearer,
with heavy flowering years alternating with lighter displays. Every
other year, alternate bloomers cause much consternation and
discussion among their owners as to what's wrong with the tree.
</P>
<P>
   Rampant Ivy
</P>
<P>
   Q. I live on the South Jersey shore on a peninsula near the bay.
My backyard is full of very tall, straight-trunked evergreen trees,
species unknown. One of them has ivy completely covering the lower
two-thirds of the trunk. It is very beautiful, but will it hurt the
tree? Is it acceptable to cut the ivy at the ground and let it die
before removal?
</P>
<P>
   A. One of the drawbacks to immobility is being subject to the
indignities and dangers of more aggressive neighbors. We may enjoy
the aged look, but the tree finds itself, bark to rootlet, with a
fierce competitor for food and water.
</P>
<P>
   Ivy doesn't stop with the trunk. As it grows among the branches
and into the crown, it shades out leaves or needles, traps ice and
snow, and adds tremendous weight, making the branches more
vulnerable to damage from winds and winter storms. But the real
problem is underground, where the ivy's dense, shallow root mat
takes up most of the water before the tree can get any.
</P>
<P>
   Cutting the ivy at the base will kill what's on the tree, but
not necessarily the ability to resprout, and it doesn't solve the
other problems. It won't just fall off on its own accord, and
stripping it requires some care. If you yank it from below it may
break off just out of reach, or it may pull away with large
sections of the outer bark. That won't kill the tree, but it does
make it more vulnerable to other pests until it heals. If the ivy
extends beyond your reach, call a qualified arborist (your local
county cooperative extension can provide a list of licensed
arborists) to do it for you.
</P>
<P>
   Beating the Bolt
</P>
<P>
   Q. Every year I plant lettuce, and every year when the heat
arrives, the lettuce stretches and gets bitter. If I knew what
caused this I could probably prevent it. Any suggestions?
</P>
<P>
   A. When lettuce gets ready to bolt, it takes a quick look over
its shoulder (heads must have shoulders, right?), grows more stem
than leaves, fills those ever-smaller leaves with bitter sap, sends
up a flower stalk, makes seed and dies. All pretty dramatic but not
much good for a midsummer salad.
</P>
<P>
   You could have two different varieties sitting next to each
other in the garden. Same soil, sun and water, same days and
nights, but suddenly one takes off and the other doesn't. As they
say (although usually not about lettuce), the devil is in the
details. In this case, genetic details.
</P>
<P>
   Every variety of lettuce comes with an internal clock, and as it
grows it counts the hours of daylight each day. When the total on
the clock matches the number specified by its genes, it bolts.
About halfway through the required hours of daylight, however, it
begins to get anxious. From then on, until its scheduled wake-up
alarm, stress from too much heat or longer days will speed up its
metabolism and start the seed production process early.
</P>
<P>
   Since lettuce should be planted in succession _ a few seeds each
week, to keep your harvest at a constant level _ as summer comes
you can make changes to help your crop. Reduce the stresses by
providing a little shade (interplant among taller crops) and enough
water (heat increases evaporation loss), but remember that the
clock still ticks. Best bet? Start planting varieties that come
with slower clocks, listed in catalogs as slow to bolt, summer
varieties or heat-tolerant. Simpson Elite, Sierra, Buttercrunch,
Medallion, Red Sails and Vanity are all worth looking for.
</P>
<P>
   Sources for a wide variety of lettuces include Johnny's Selected
Seeds, 1 Foss Hill Road, Albion, Maine 04910, (207) 437-4301, and

Q &AMP; A: SPEED LIMITS ON MODEMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By J.D. BIERSDORFER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I own a 56 K modem. The manual says the highest speed that
the modem can legally attain is 53 kilobits per second because of
speed limits. What are these limits and why do they exist?
</P>
<P>
   A. The Federal Communications Commission does not explicitly set
a speed limit on how fast a modem can transmit data. But it does
regulate the power of the signal that such devices may transmit,
which in effect puts a limit on speed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The power limit of -12dBm _ in plainer language, about 63
microwatts _ for phone lines was set to prevent possible
interference or noise bleeding into adjacent lines and other
electrical devices. (Imagine trying to hold a quiet conversation
with someone at a party where everyone is when music is playing
loudly and people nearby are yelling.) At that upper limit, the
maximum attainable speed is about 53 K (kilobits per second). With
the maximum capacity of a telephone line being about 64 K, the FCC
wants to limit the noise within a safe, respectable limit to make
sure electronic devices in use do not conflict with each other.
</P>
<P>
   Although improvements to the technology are under development,
the 56 K boast has always been somewhat conditional. Unlike the
slower modems that came before them, the current 56 K models
operate at different speeds depending on whether the data is coming
toward you (being downloaded) or you are sending data from your
computer (uploading).
</P>
<P>
   Many modem companies claim the 56 K speed for downloading, but
uploading often tops out at 33.6 K or 28.8 K.

SURVEY FINDS LITTLE HARM IN SURFING FOR CYBERSEX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYCHE HENDRICKS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Sex is definitely a hot topic on the Internet,
but the Web is not breeding a generation of sex addicts, according
to a new study by Stanford researcher Alvin Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Cooper found, Web surfers are looking for a little
cybersex entertainment, and the anonymity of the Internet lets them
feel more comfortable exploring sexual topics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like the Web is this irresistible sexual magnet,
where people who venture in are going to get trapped,'' he said.
``Most people use it for sexual purposes in a recreational way,''
much as they might watch ``Baywatch'' or flip through a Playboy
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper heads the Marital Services and Sexuality Center in San
Jose, Calif. He and his research team posted a 47-question survey
on the MSNBC Web site in April, asking people about their ``on-line
sexual behavior,'' what they look at and what they get out of it.
</P>
<P>
   The team was hoping to exceed the largest previous study, which
looked at 400 people, Cooper said. But it was overwhelmed by the
response.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than 5,000 people responded during the first 24 hours,''
said Sylvain Boies, a clinical psychology fellow at Stanford
University who helped produce the study. The survey yielded 13,500
responses, of which 9,100 were deemed usable.
</P>
<P>
   Of the respondents to the poll, roughly 8 percent could be
qualified as cybersex compulsives, using sexual sites more than 10
hours a week and reporting that their use distressed them or
interfered with their relationships. Cooper said 3 percent to 6
percent of the general population engages in compulsive sexual
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sex on the Internet is like alcohol,'' Cooper said. ``It's not
inherently good or bad, it's what you do with it. If you drink a
glass of wine a day, it might enhance your life. If you get sloppy
drunk every night, it's a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper cited in his report statistics gathered by Relevant
Knowledge, a Web traffic-tracking company, that found 9.6 million
users, or 15 percent of all Web users, logged on to the 10 most
popular sexual sites in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty widespread phenomenon,'' Boies said.
</P>
<P>
   For people predisposed to sexual compulsivity, the accessibility
and anonymity of the Internet can make it easier to fall into
destructive behavior, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But those same traits of cyberspace may help people feel more
comfortable exploring erotic pursuits there. That may be why a
growing number of women are turning to sexy Internet sites, Cooper
speculated.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the survey found that men seeking sex on the Internet
outnumber women five to one. And they're looking for different
things. Men went after pornographic pictures, while women joined
steamy ``chat rooms'' for hot talk.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers acknowledged that their respondents were
self-selected, not a random sample, and all were MSNBC users, whom
Cooper characterized as more professionally successful and affluent
than average Internet users. But because of the size of the survey,
he said, he believes it provides a valuable snapshot of people who
go on-line for sexual pursuits.

PRESIDENT KIM MAKES SALES PITCH FOR INVESTMENT IN SOUTH KOREA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ South Korean President Kim Dae-jung played
traveling salesman Wednesday, pitching his economically troubled
homeland as an ideal spot for American investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We built one of the leading economies in the world in just
three decades, rising from the ruins of war,'' Kim said in an
address before a joint session of Congress. ``We have a proven
potential. We are resilient. But we now need your help.''
</P>
<P>
   In that speech and an earlier one before business executives at
a breakfast sponsored by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Kim painted
a picture of a nation in transition.
</P>
<P>
   The old South Korea, built out of the devastation of the Korean
War that ended in stalemate in 1953, was governed by political
strongmen and their military allies. They fostered an economic
system centered around chaebols, huge family conglomerates built
with government-directed financing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corruption prevailed,'' Kim told Congress. ``Imprudent
borrowing weakened our nation's banks and businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of South Korea's economy last year paved the way
for the December election of Kim, a pro-democracy dissident who had
spent six years in jail under the previous regimes.
</P>
<P>
   The new South Korea, he said, is committed to free elections,
representative government and free trade. Kim's government is
sending signals to North Korea that reconciliation is possible if
both sides take steps to achieve it. Under the old regime,
rapprochement was unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie B.C. Oh, professor of Korean studies at Georgetown
University here, said later that Kim ``wants to let the American
public, especially the business community, know the worst of
(South) Korea's economic troubles are over. These kinds of economic
reforms never would have occurred without cataclysmic economic
difficulties. So, in a way, the economic downturn is a shot in the
arm.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Chamber of Commerce, Kim ticked off structural changes
his government is promoting in South Korea's economy to make it
more attractive to foreign investment: Companies will be open to
hostile mergers and acquisitions, non-Koreans may buy and use land
in South Korea, the government is developing a ``one-stop'' service
center for investors, and South Korea is drafting a new law on
foreign investment designed to stimulate overseas financing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to make our country the most favorable, the most
convenient, the most safe place for foreign investments,'' Kim said
through a translator.
</P>
<P>
   A $57 billion cash infusion last December from the International
Monetary Fund saved South Korea from economic collapse. Although
its economy is still troubled, Kim insisted things are better now.
South Korea had just $3.9 billion in foreign exchange on hand on
Dec. 18, the day Kim was elected. Now it has $35 billion, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Strapped with huge debts, many of the huge South Korean
conglomerates are making deals with U.S companies to create or
consolidate joint ventures. Last month, Hewlett-Packard Co., the
Palo Alto, Calif., computer manufacturer, purchased Samsung
Electronics Co.'s 45 percent stake in a joint venture,
Hewlett-Packard Korea for $73 million.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Samsung Heavy Industries Co. sold its
forklift truck business to a U.S. company, Clark Material Handling
Co. of Lexington, Ky., for $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   Kim invited executives at the chamber breakfast to ``make a
mental note'' to invest $100 million each in South Korea, ``maybe
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Reminded at the breakfast that he was due on Capitol Hill to
address Congress, Kim joked that he was in no hurry. ``You are my
most important audience on this trip,'' he told the executives.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In his speech to Congress, Kim, 74, offered an emotional
recounting of the heavy price he paid as a democratic activist.
</P>
<P>
   He said he survived five attempts on his life _ one by agents of
communist North Korea and the other four by the ``military
dictators'' of the south. In addition to his six years in prison,
he was in exile or under house arrest for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   He credited U.S. diplomatic intervention for saving his life
when South Korean government agents kidnapped him in 1973 and 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will never forget America and the destiny that so strongly
binds my political life to your nation,'' he told lawmakers.

     CLINTON VIEWS BAPTIST WRIT ON WIVES'
SUBMISSION WITH `WRY AMUSEMENT'
 &HT;     By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton reacted with ``wry amusement''
Wednesday to news that his fellow Southern Baptists are urging
wives to ``submit'' to the will of their husbands, a spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He noted with wry amusement the article this morning and
thought about how he might call it to the attention'' to First Lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton, White House spokesman Michael McCurry told
reporters. ``I don't know whether he elected to do so or not.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Southern Baptist Convention amended its
statement of faith to include an admonition that a woman should
``submit herself graciously'' to her husband's leadership. A
husband, in turn, should ``provide for, protect and lead his
family,'' declared the statement, a sort of spiritual road map for
the 16 million Americans the denomination claims.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, a Southern Baptist, does not agree that women should be
expected to submit to their husbands' will, McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are occasions when the president's views as a Southern
Baptist are not always identical to those of the Southern Baptist
Convention,'' said McCurry. ``This is clearly one of those cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton has long worshipped as a Methodist. She attended a
Methodist church in Little Rock, and she and the president
regularly attend a Methodist church in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the president, as someone who worships both with his
wife in the United Methodist Church and occasionally in the
Southern Baptist Church and then at other denominations as well,
would consider himself a practicing and devout Christian,'' said
McCurry.

PROPOSAL TO PRIVATIZE PUBLIC SCHOOL DRAWS CRITICISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIAN GUTHRIE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Labor leaders and child advocates assailed a
proposal to hand one of San Francisco's lowest performing
elementary schools over to a for-profit company.
</P>
<P>
   The Edison Project educational management company offered $1.3
million each for start-up costs at two San Francisco elementary
schools. The Board of Education has rejected half the proposal, to
let the company run the new Tenderloin Community School.
</P>
<P>
   The other part of the proposal is to take over operations of the
Edison Elementary School in Noe Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of Edison Elementary, however, is unknown. Parents and
teachers at the school _ which has among the lowest test scores in
the district and has had four principals in less than a year _ will
vote on the proposal Friday. The school board is expected to cast a
final vote June 23.
</P>
<P>
   No one at Tuesday night's board meeting voiced support for the
private-public partnership.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Johnson, secretary treasurer of the San Francisco Labor
Council, vowed to put ``thousands of people in the street'' to
protest the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would have thought that the privatization cloud would
hover over our schools?'' Johnson asked. ``Privatization is a fancy
name for contracting out. Contracting out is a fancy name for
copping out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Donald and Doris Fisher Foundation has pledged $25 million
to schools in California that agree to become Edison sites.
Fisher's son John owns 4 percent of the Edison Project.
</P>
<P>
   The Edison Project was created by Christopher Whittle, the
Tennessee media entrepreneur who brought child-geared television
into classrooms through Channel One. The company operates 25 public
schools in eight states. Although California has 125 so-called
charter schools, which are independent public schools, most are
not-for-profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should not allow desperate parents and demoralized teachers
to feel the only option they have is to turn the school over to the
Fisher family and Chris Whittle,'' said San Francisco youth
lobbyist Margaret Brodkin.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, school Superintendent Bill Rojas said the
real decision will be made by the parents and teachers at Edison
Elementary. If they approve the plan with a majority vote Friday,
the Edison Project will take over the school, Rojas said.

MY OWN PERSONAL ANTITRUST ACTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MICHELLE SLATALLA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a child, I liked to rip off mattress tags, the kind that
threatened prosecution to anyone who removed them. So I was excited
to learn a few days ago about a simple shareware program that
allows a computer user to deface the Windows operating system in
much the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the program, called Logo Manager, doesn't do actual
damage to Windows, any more than removing that tag makes a mattress
lumpy. The program simply enables a user to bypass the Microsoft
start-up screen, which pops up on the monitor each time the
computer is booted.
</P>
<P>
   But in these days of intense debate over the legality of
Microsoft's iron-fisted control over the look of the desktop, I
felt some action was warranted. Let the government lead the broader
charge; I wanted to open my own personal antitrust offensive,
striking a small, symbolic blow in favor of free choice by
replacing the familiar image of the Windows flag silhouetted
against a blue sky with one of a dozen alternatives from Logo
Manager.
</P>
<P>
   Would I pick the Western sunset? Or the scene with a miner
panning for gold? Or perhaps the pair of preening geishas, whose
pink robes reminded me of a Halloween costume from my distant past?
</P>
<P>
   Still, I wanted to be cautious. I checked with Microsoft to make
sure that the minor rebellion I was contemplating would not cause
my operating system to explode. It was a logical concern; if the
browser is an integral part of the Windows product, who is to say
that the start-up screen is any less important?
</P>
<P>
   Jim Cullinan, a Microsoft spokesman, reassured me. ``You're an
end user,'' he said, although that was not the reassuring part.
``So do whatever you want to change the look and personality of
your computer. We just want to insure that you're buying a product
that is guaranteed to our standards. If someone between Microsoft
and the consumer makes changes, who knows what that will do to the
product?''
</P>
<P>
   Legal talk. I was far more focused on installing those geishas.
Was that too much to ask?
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, yes _ as I found out after I downloaded Logo Manager
from ZDNet's software library (www.hotfiles.com). The program
didn't work. Well, to be fair, only part of it worked. I did easily
install the shareware on my hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   Reading the Help file, I learned how to click on a single button
to attain my first goal: suppressing the Windows start-up screen. I
rebooted the computer a few times, smugly reveling in the absence
of on-screen advertising for Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   But I still needed to complete my mission by substituting the
image of the fan-wielding geishas. Following the instructions, I
scrolled through Logo Manager's list of images until I found them,
then clicked on the image. That's when the problem occurred. No
matter how many times I rebooted, no geishas. Instead, the pesky
Windows start-up screen appeared again!
</P>
<P>
   Like any respectable self-taught home computer user, I harbored
a nagging suspicion that I was doing something wrong. I repeated
the steps with no luck. Other features of the program worked
perfectly. I was, for instance, easily able to substitute the
geishas for the Windows shutdown screen. But no matter what
permutations of keystrokes I typed, I could not replace the
start-up screen.
</P>
<P>
   As I fought a familiar urge to put my head down on my keyboard
and cry, a tiny, hopeful thought occurred: What if the problem
wasn't my fault? I congratulated myself because I had come so far
from the days when I once panicked so badly over a system error
message that I screamed at my husband: ``Get the children out of
the house to safety! The cats, too!'' And I wasn't really that
attached to the cats.
</P>
<P>
   I phoned Tim Smith, ZDNet's production and programming manager,
to see if he could help. ``It's working fine on my machine right
now, but I'm running NT instead of Windows,'' Smith said. ``It's
also fine on an old 486 from Dell, which is here running Windows
95.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So it's me?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Support issues are always tough to figure out,'' he said.
``Let me try it on some of the other machines in the office.''
</P>
<P>
   Five minutes later, Smith called back. He reported that the
geishas behaved just fine on some of the other machines in his
office, including a computer running Windows 98. But when he tried
to run Logo Manager on a twin of my nearly new Micron Millenia
333-megahertz machine, he could not replace the Windows start-up
screen with the geishas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's depressing,'' Smith said. ``Every manufacturer's machine
is a little different. If we had a week or a month to work on it,
we could probably figure it out.''
</P>
<P>
   I was starting to feel bad for him. ``Well, just call Micron and
ask what they did and then take it into consideration in the next
release of Logo Manager,'' I suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what if it's not just Micron?'' Smith said. ``It could be
Gateway, too, maybe H-P, IBM _ who knows? We'd have to get every
machine from every manufacturer to know for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a long pause while we both considered the
possibilities. Then Smith said, ``It kind of stinks.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes, it does. Logo Manager is a really nifty program, so
it's too bad that not everyone can take advantage of all its
features. Worse, you cannot even blame anyone for the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Someday, of course, hardware and software will be truly
standardized and will work as reliably as all the televisions in
the world or all the toasters. We will all benefit because it will
be that much easier to harness the tantalizing power of a
ubiquitous network to work and play.
</P>
<P>
   But in the meantime? I searched for words to comfort Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe Microsoft has a point,'' I said.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Our history rears its ugly head
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ A few weeks ago I wrote a piece recalling the
1961 book, ``Black Like Me,'' and the horrors of segregation that
it exposed.
</P>
<P>
   A fellow I know, who says he likes most everything I write, said
he didn't like that one.
</P>
<P>
   He allowed that those bad old days should be put to rest, that
the era is over and done with, and there's nothing to be gained
from stirring the awful memories.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't say anything. I didn't want to argue.
</P>
<P>
   But that was a few weeks ago. Now the argument has been settled
in the worst possible way.
</P>
<P>
   An hour's drive from here toward the Louisiana border, a black
man was brutally and cruelly murdered in cold blood and without
mercy, dragged to death on a chain behind a pickup truck until an
arm and his head were torn away from his body.
</P>
<P>
   Law officers have charged three white men who are said to have
ties with Ku Klux Klan-type organizations. The FBI has joined the
investigation. So has Jesse Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   It's a time of shame and sorrow. Just when we get to the point
of thinking it can't happen here, it happens again.
</P>
<P>
   Heaven help us, we're not that far removed _ a mere 30 years _
from a time when racism was our way of life, passed along from one
generation to another.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians campaigned on it.
</P>
<P>
   Policemen enforced it.
</P>
<P>
   Preachers preached it.
</P>
<P>
   Parents believed it.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers taught it.
</P>
<P>
   Children learned it.
</P>
<P>
   And it's among us yet _ now and maybe forever.
</P>
<P>
   I'm a racist. Why shouldn't I be? It was everything I was ever
told as a child.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, though, I wonder if I'm the only one who is.
Everybody else is so quick to tell you he isn't.
</P>
<P>
   At best, I'm a recovering racist. At worst, I'm a racist who
sounds no different from the worst of them.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes for a joke, sometimes in anger or disgust, I repeat
the evil words _ sometimes before I even realize it.
</P>
<P>
   For me, it's the same as taking the Lord's name in vain. I catch
myself, and I say a prayer of forgiveness for my sins against my
fellow man.
</P>
<P>
   Today I say a prayer for my fellow man who died at the hands of
bigots. Cause of death, ignorance and hatred.
</P>
<P>
   The town of Jasper, pop. 8,000, is itself a victim. This
community where more than 40 percent of the citizens are black,
including the mayor, will be remembered for years to come in terms
of racially motivated murder.
</P>
<P>
   The white people will realize how unfair it is. The black people
already know.
</P>
<P>
   For every crime committed by a person who happens to be black,
white racism indicts an entire people.
</P>
<P>
   I only hope that good people everywhere will not judge us in the
same way.

YEAR 2000 COMPUTER GLITCH COULD THREATEN MILLIONS OF INVESTORS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Financial experts warned Wednesday that the
possible Year 2000 computer glitch could threaten the safety of
billions of dollars in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   While corporations and government agencies are spending tens of
billions of dollars to solve the problem, investors still do not
know if those organizations are devoting enough time and resources
to fix the potential computer bug before Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors need to know if their stocks will have value,'' Sen.
Robert Bennett, R-Utah, said at a Senate banking subcommittee
hearing on the impact of the Year 2000 problem on the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett announced at the hearing that he has introduced
legislation that would require companies to make specific
disclosures about what they have done to solve the problem and what
work they have left to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The millions of people out there putting their money into
these companies have a right to know if they're prepared or not,
and those companies have an obligation to tell them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Computer experts warn that many computers originally programmed
to recognize only the last two digits of a year will fail or
malfunction on Jan. 1, 2000, when the machines will assume it is
1900.
</P>
<P>
   Under this theory, the impact of the glitch would be felt when
one computer system that thinks the year is 1900 interacts with
another computer system that thinks the year is 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The theory continues: Because computers can't think, neither
system can understand why it is 99 years ahead or behind. Unable to
sort out the problem, the two systems would either stop or give out
wrong information.
</P>
<P>
   Some computers can be reprogrammed through tedious review of
their software code, but many devices have embedded microchips that
must be physically replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Yardeni, chief economist for the North American division
of the investment firm Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, said the potential
computer failures could prove devastating for many companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way things stand, there's a good chance the Year 2000
problem will cause a recession about the size we saw in 1973 and
1974 when the Middle East cut off our oil,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett described how the glitch could impact even a company
that had its computers fixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens when a company that relies on just-in-time
delivery wakes up and discovers the trains aren't running to bring
them their supplies? Or when their supplier is shut down because of
Year 2000? Or when many of the firms that used to buy the company's
products can't anymore because their factories are shut down?'' he
asked.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``That's not even mentioning the problems a company
could have with basic things like using a telephone or trying to
make a financial transaction or even if the water is still running,
all of which could be affected by Year 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven L. Hock, president of Triaxsys Research Corp. of
Missoula, Mont., a consulting firm, said that nearly half of the
nation's 250 largest companies have disclosed no information on
their Year 2000 problem.
</P>
<P>
   Of the companies that did provide some disclosure, most of the
information was so sketchy that it gave no clue as to where the
firms were in solving the problem, Hock said.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 10 companies gave specific details on their progress
toward fixing or replacing bad computer systems and predicted
whether they would be ready by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we just don't know which companies are at risk, and
neither do investors,'' Hock said.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that Congress require all companies to answer a
standardized set of specific questions on their plans for fixing
the Year 2000 problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The questions need to be extremely detailed, so companies
don't have any room to write around the truth,'' Hock said.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Stout, a professor of securities law at Georgetown
University, said companies would continue to avoid giving full
information unless they are forced to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, companies are afraid that telling the truth will
scare away investors or tip off their competition, so they don't do
it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (STORY COULD END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Bennett's legislation would require a
company to:
</P>
<P>
   _ Tell what it is doing to fix the Year 2000 problem;
</P>
<P>
   _ Disclose a summary of all costs already incurred in solving
the potential glitch and how much more money the company expects to
spend;
</P>
<P>
   _ Provide an estimate of expected litigation costs from Year
2000 problems;
</P>
<P>
   _ Report whether the firm is insured for the problem and how
much it is costing;
</P>
<P>
   _ Disclose whether the company has contingency plans to ensure
continued operations in the event of a Year 2000 computer failure.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DORCHESTER, England _ It was not the kind of headline that
Charles, the prince of Wales, was used to in the British press.
``The Prince Has Got It Right,'' trumpeted The Independent.
</P>
<P>
   What prompted this hearty endorsement of someone the British
seldom tire of tweaking was Poundbury, the new community springing
to daring old life here. The planned town perfectly embodies the
outspoken heir to the throne's views of modern architecture as
owing a debt to the past.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Charles' blunt expression of those attitudes in the 1980s
started a public shouting match with the country's design
establishment that attracted world attention. He taunted
architects, saying that the Luftwaffe had treated London with more
care than they had. They cast him as a feckless intruder into a
refined world, with taste they classed as pedestrian, retrograde
and fustian.
</P>
<P>
   The crusading magazine he founded to advance his ideas,
Perspectives on Architecture, folded in April, and the institute he
created to instill students with more respect for tradition has had
revolving-door leadership and minimal impact.
</P>
<P>
   But here in the Dorset countryside, he may have hit on a way of
redeeming his breathtaking claim that the country's architects were
more out of touch with the desires of ordinary Britons than the
future leader of the famously remote British monarchy was.
</P>
<P>
   Poundbury is an attempt to create a 21st-century community that
looks as if it grew up over time, with a long linger in the 18th
and 19th centuries when this rural part of southwestern England _
with its stone villages, thatched white cottages and twisting lanes
_ inspired Thomas Hardy.
</P>
<P>
   Its 400 acres will one day be home to 5,000 people living in
houses and cottages of period design with stores and offices all
within walking distance.
</P>
<P>
   It takes some imagination to visualize all this from the 12
acres that have been developed. With 142 tidy new homes up, less
than a tenth of its planned population to animate its streets, and
recently planted trees in their gawky adolescence, Poundbury can
still strike a visitor as the freshly carpentered back lot for the
latest big-budget clogs-and-shawls setting of ``The Mayor of
Casterbridge.''
</P>
<P>
   Built on land that the prince's Duchy of Cornwall owns, and
designed by Leon Krier, an architect from Luxembourg who is a
champion of traditional town planning, Poundbury is an ambitious
project that is meant to change attitudes about building, housing
mix, traffic, energy savings, parking, zoning and shopping.
</P>
<P>
   With its first two sections nearing completion this summer, it
is emerging as a pleasingly chockablock village of rusticated
stonework homes, meandering streets, alleys and mews, and market
arcades and public squares. Street lanterns with ornamental caps
hang from metalwork struts on the sides of buildings or on gently
curving masonry walls, casting Poundbury each evening in a soft
play of light and shadow.
</P>
<P>
   Poundbury was derided as a kitschy time warp using a sentimental
pastiche of outmoded styles and toy-town concepts when plans first
emerged in 1989. In answer to written questions from The New York
Times, Prince Charles wrote that he remembered ``a torrent of
criticism and abuse that was beyond all belief and amounted, over
the years, to a continuous stream of `knocking' stories in the
press.''
</P>
<P>
   But the town has recently begun to gain favor with the writers,
designers, architects, planners and backpacking day-trippers who
swarm over the project in growing numbers. Cabdrivers now
affectionately call the destination Charleyville.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over all, the effect is polite, elegant and as English as a
vicar's tea party,'' the magazine Homes and Antiques said. ``I
arrived a skeptic,'' a critic from The Financial Times said. ``I
left a convert.''
</P>
<P>
   In his response, which he penned in flowing red ink, Charles
wrote that he thought opinion had swung around in the project's
favor because ``more and more people are going to look at Poundbury
for themselves and finding it is completely different from the
negative propaganda they have read about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Its residents have become its most vigorous advocates. ``Try as
hard as they can, the media cannot find many people in the local
area to knock it,'' the prince wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Paying particular attention to the one part of his architectural
campaign that seems to be impressing people, he is a frequent and
apparently welcome visitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just sat down there on the sofa, took his boots off and
nattered on like anyone else,'' said Diane Bryant, whose husband,
Peter, is the head of the Poundbury Residents' Association. ``He
wasn't patronizing at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The locals are even good-natured about the way all the visitors
talk to them as if they were the stand-in blacksmiths and wig
makers of Colonial Williamsburg. ``I've been gardening, and people
will walk up the path expecting us to be dressed in period costume,
doing the Hardy bit,'' said Jennie Fellowes, a schoolteacher who
lives in a rented cottage with her 11-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   Her home is one of 55 subsidized ``social housing'' units
interspersed throughout the community; it is a source of pride here
that these rental buildings are indistinguishable from the
privately owned homes. ``I challenge you to try to tell,'' Bryant
said, sweeping his gaze up and down the streets of stucco and brick
and flint-work town houses. ``People who buy here know they're
coming into a mixed community,'' Mrs. Bryant said. ``They don't
find out only after they've parted with their money.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, it seems, no NIMBY problem in Poundbury. ``Our
principle from the start has been to pepper-pot the social housing,
scattering it through the development,'' said Andrew Hamilton, the
development director. ``Builders said: `We can't build private
houses next to social housing. They won't sell.' But we have proved
that this is not true.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment all 142 homes are sold and, according to Hamilton,
resale value has increased as much as 20 percent in three years.
Plot sizes range from 1,500 square feet to 80,000 square feet.
Every house is designed by an architect, and cannot be the same as
any other in the vicinity.
</P>
<P>
   Architects must work in the ``vernacular,'' which in the case of
Dorset means Purbeck marble and Portland stone and a rich local
vocabulary of brick, chalk, roof slate and stucco called
``render.'' There can be no decorative tricks like half-timbering
or gaudy ornamentation.
</P>
<P>
   The houses may look antique from the outside, but they have
double-glazed windows, high-efficiency condensing boilers, extra
insulation and computer-controlled energy-management systems to
reduce fuel consumption.
</P>
<P>
   All services _ telephone, electricity, gas and drainage _ are
buried in channels behind the housing; one large satellite dish
hidden behind a high masonry wall serves the community. All you
will see protruding from a Poundbury roof is a stately brick
chimney or a polished weather vane. Houses stand flush with the
street so that when you step from your front door, you're already
in town.

</P>
<P>
   Krier's decision to have his streets and alleyways wander and
their breadths widen and narrow randomly has created bends and
blind corners that add a sense of anticipation and theater to
taking a stroll or running an errand.
</P>
<P>
   They have the added value of controlling traffic without
resorting to gimmicks like speed bumps. There are no straightaways
in Poundbury that allow drivers to exceed 20 mph. ``The streets are
simply short and winding on the same principle that stream beds
slow down water,'' Krier said.
</P>
<P>
   The developers realized early on that they had to coexist with
automobiles. ``We decided not to murder the car, but to suppress
it, to make it subservient,'' said Simon Conibear, an executive of
the Duchy of Cornwall. They wrestled highway regulations that
called for providing each family space for 2.5 cars down to 2.3 and
have held out the promise of larger garden space for smaller
parking space, an alluring trade-off for flower-besotted Britons.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of houses ranges from $95,000 to $300,000, but even the
most expensive stick to modest dimensions. To maintain firm control
over the quality of the finished product, the duchy does not sell
the land to the builder until the construction is done and
approved.
</P>
<P>
   Britain is studded with red-brick suburbs that march in numbing
grids up and down its contours. Built originally for men returning
from the war, they proved functional but uninspiring. Now the
government estimates that Britain must build 4.4 million new homes
by the year 2016.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the very real threat to the quality and integrity of the
British countryside from the insensitive uglification of standard
housing developments,'' the prince responded, ``people have begun
to realize that Poundbury might just offer a more imaginative and
attractive approach from which to draw inspiration.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he also hoped the example of Poundbury would rattle the
bureaucracy. ``Some of the most difficult attitudes to change are
those rigidly conventional ones held by local councilors and by
professionals such as planning consultants, road and traffic
engineers, building standards regulators, lighting engineers and
the kind of social engineers who seem to regard human beings as
technological units of some millennial utopia,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The origins of the Poundbury project began in a controversy that
is sometimes forgotten because of the succession of subsequent
attention-getting crises in the prince's life.
</P>
<P>
   His fight with the British modern-architecture establishment
preceded news of the breakdown of his marriage; the tapes of his
tangy conversations with his mistress, Camilla Parker-Bowles; and
zestful accounts of his bent for communing with mystical beings on
the Scottish moors.
</P>
<P>
   It was a time when the percussive single-syllable words like
``twit'' and ``prat'' that Britons use to dress down their
well-born often accompanied mention of the prince's name in
broadcast satires and newspaper commentaries.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1984, at the celebration of the 150th anniversary of the
Royal Institute of British Architects, Prince Charles declared his
views on what its members had done. In the most famous line from
the speech, he compared the planned extension of the facade of the
National Gallery in London's Trafalgar Square to ``a monstrous
carbuncle on the face of a much loved and elegant friend.''
</P>
<P>
   He complained that people were never consulted about the
construction of communities they were to live in, and that the
establishment deliberately made them feel ``guilty or ignorant if
their natural preference is for the more `traditional designs' _
for a small garden, for courtyards, arches and porches.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, he took on the design establishment again,
deploring the modern buildings and proposals for new ones in
Paternoster Square, the area around St. Paul's Cathedral. His 1989
book ``A Vision of Britain'' outlined 10 simplistic rules for
architecture, and the battle lines were drawn.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Rogers, a leading British architect and lecturer on
planning, threw down the gauntlet. ``As a man with strong views
about architecture, a high public profile and enormous private
wealth,'' the architect said of the prince, ``he has an
extraordinary opportunity to commission buildings for his large
estates, but he has yet to produce a noteworthy construction.''
</P>
<P>
   The prince was at that time pondering a request from the local
council to sell the 400-acre Poundbury farm to a national developer
for housing that was much needed. (The Duchy of Cornwall, which
comprises 128,000 acres in 22 counties of England, was created in
1337 by Edward III to provide income for the heir to the throne.)
</P>
<P>
   The prince instead asked Krier to do a master plan, liked what
he came up with and made Poundbury the cornerstone of his
architecture campaign. Krier, whose most recent book carries the
dedication ``A mon Prince,'' found Charles a refreshingly untypical
English client. ``Lots of English people say exactly the opposite
of what they mean,'' he said. ``The prince is absolutely frank.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he permitted himself to gloat over the welcome his
once-derided project is now receiving, Prince Charles made it clear
that he was happy he hadn't followed an easier path. ``If the duchy
had sold the land to the highest bidder for several million pounds
and then walked away to have a developer build yet another housing
estate on the edge of yet another English town as happens
elsewhere,'' he said, ``would anyone have uttered a word of
criticism?''

 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Restaurants in Palm Beach International
Airport will have to serve up better prices if they want to win a
contract to sell food.
</P>
<P>
   Airport Director Bruce Pelly said he is tired of seeing
customers abandon their orders at the register when they hear how
much they owe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there's a feeling out there in the public that, one,
airport food isn't that good, and two, it's overpriced,'' Pelly
said. ``If the prices are good, then you'll sell more food, and
everyone will make more money.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why a new request for bids, due June 18, asks would-be
food concessionaires to offer ``street level'' prices, which are
markedly lower than the ``captive audience'' prices at airports and
food courts.
</P>
<P>
   The current contract with CA One Services Inc. expires Sept. 30.
The Buffalo, N.Y.-based company has run the airport's food and
beverage outlets since 1988, when the terminal opened.
</P>
<P>
   By Oct. 1, a new contract will be in place, ushering in nine
months of construction and transition for the airport's four
restaurants and half-dozen food stands.
</P>
<P>
   Besides lower prices, proposed changes include:
</P>
<P>
   Coffee kiosks at the end of concourses.
</P>
<P>
   More name brands and local restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   A lounge with telephones and business machines where the
Atlantic Cafe and Lounge used to sit.
</P>
<P>
   A 10-year agreement with one, five-year renewal possible.
</P>
<P>
   Pauline Armbrust, editor of Palm Beach Gardens-based World
Airport Retail News, said PBIA's plans fit in with a trend toward
name brands and more reasonable prices at airports in the past four
years.
</P>
<P>
   The reason: ``When you provide customers with value and quality,
the airport can make a lot of money out of doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   PBIA made $870,719 last year from its food and beverage
concessions, but officials are aiming higher with the next
contract.
</P>
<P>
   CA One got a five-year contract in 1988, with three renewal
options of five years each. But in 1992 county commissioners
decided to terminate the contract at the end of 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the Department of Airports attributed the problems
to lower-than-expected passenger counts, the poor location of the
Atlantic Cafe, and trends toward brand names and casual dining.
</P>
<P>
   CA One, which runs concessions in 30 airports nationwide, plans
to bid again, said general manager Tim Bannigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our facilities have addressed the needs of the travelers in
Palm Beach County very well,'' he said. ``Can we do better? I
certainly hope so.''
</P>
<P>
   Whoever serves the snacks next at PBIA will have to ground their
prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to not gouge people when they go through the
airport,'' Pelly said.

 &HT;    Ernest Holsendolph's Business Commentary: Families discover the
wonders of WebTV
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Some pursuits are solitary, like stamp collecting or
developing pictures in a darkroom. Pleasant, absorbing, but
solitary. Much about personal computing matches that pattern, a
single person and his or her computer, surfing and exploring into
the night.
</P>
<P>
   When I ask people why they are among that massive 60 percent of
households that have no computer at home, many people, especially
those with families, say it's because Internet venturing is
cloistered, a poor way to spend time after a long day at work.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons why Bill Gates has bought WebTV technology is
because he, more than most of us, realizes something new is needed
on the landscape. The romp through the computer networks for fun
and information needs transformation, a new setting, an alternative
way to bring new kinds of people into the information age.
</P>
<P>
   If that's his aim, Gates again may be on to something.
</P>
<P>
   WebTV was born as an inexpensive way to get onto the Internet
using a black box and a television set. It was dismissed by many
computer veterans as, at best, a training wheels version of
computer surfing -- or worse yet, computing for people who hate
computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than two-thirds of people who own WebTV do not have
personal computers in their homes,'' said Greg Goodruff, vice
president at Sony Electronics in New Jersey. ``That's how we know
WebTV is a different kind of experience, appealing to a different
group.''
</P>
<P>
   WebTV has advanced, and so has its fans.
</P>
<P>
   I was surprised recently when Ken Beauchamp, manager of retail
sales at the Computer City store near Dunwoody, told me that WebTV
was his medium of choice for Internet surfing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's put it this way,'' he said. ``I have a lot more fun
doing my surfing on my 35-inch television set than you can on your
15-inch monitor.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest version of the system, called WebTV Plus, has added
dimensions that allow subscribers to access cable television and
the Internet through the same box. Several unique features include
an electronic TV guide that describes program offerings quickly,
and also permits subscribers to see cable programs and Internet
information simultaneously on the same screen.
</P>
<P>
   Beauchamp said his family can gather around the TV and do such
group activities as explore travel options, looking at the pictures
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also look at movie choices together, planning our weekends
together,'' he said. ``We can even sit in our living room and plan
movies and other entertainment in California, where I go to visit
family.''
</P>
<P>
   In my own experience with the WebTV, I found evidence to support
that view. We hooked up the system in my living room and left it to
my teenage son, Joseph, and his school friends, Rico Harmon and
Corey Daniels. Since two of them are baseball players, they
immediately found on the Internet baseball manuals on fielding and
pitching, read them together and had animated discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Then they looked up music CDs, and even found the lyrics to rap
songs, and had a rollicking good time ``singing'' them.
</P>
<P>
   It was a far cry from the quiet, solitary individual surfing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young children get it right away,'' said Goodruff, the Sony
vice president, who happens to have two pre-teens.
</P>
<P>
   ``My boys, age 7 and 12, sit with me and watch `Wheel of
Fortune,''' Goodruff said, ``and then they surf for music, which
comes through louder and more clearly on the stereo system of our
entertainment center than it would on those little computer
speakers.''
</P>
<P>
   What families and experts agree on is this: WebTV is a new kind
of connecting point in the home, and we are likely to see newer
systems in the next year that resemble it. Examples include digital
pipelines from the cable companies that will include video, phone
service, computer access and more.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some communications specialists speculate that Bill
Gates' primary interest in WebTV is the licensing agreements that
will give him speedier access to this new kind of one-stop
entertaining center.
</P>
<P>
   Though Gates wants to sell that kind of system to others,
including cable systems, the cable operators appear determined to
do it their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Gates comes control,'' said Dave Woodrow of Cox
Communications, a major cable operator. ``We would rather do our
own system, and it may be available next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the Justice Department, in its growing list of charges
against Microsoft, is reportedly investigating how the computer
giant may install its WebTV-like features into its latest Windows
program and serve to forestall competition.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the new WebTV system has many features familiar to
the sophisticated PC user, including fast Internet connections at
56 kilobits per second. The new black box contains a hard drive, so
information can be stored, thus helping to keep the system speedy.
Also, the new systems have printers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Versions right around the corner will help subscribers import
much more data,'' said Goodruff, so WebTV will have many of the
advantages of personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   In sum, WebTV is a medium for lovers of television. But it adds,
as an extra component, the ability to surf the Internet. And before
long, that feature will be married to the television components to
create a seamless service that just might attract a mass audience.

 &HT;    New NCAA bowl procedure not perfect, but better
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The new system for selecting the two teams for college
football's national championship game is not perfect. But it's
certainly better than the methods used in the past, SEC
Commissioner Roy Kramer said recently.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer, who also is the coordinator of the Bowl Championship
Series, unveiled a rating system that will include four components
to create what will be known as the BCS Standings. The top two
teams in the standings will advance to the national championship
game, which this season will be the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 4, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The BCS is comprised of six major conferences and four major
bowls _ Fiesta, Sugar, Orange, and Rose. Each of the six conference
champs is guaranteed a slot in one of the bowls, with the top two
teams playing in a ``national championship'' game, which rotates to
a different bowl each year.
</P>
<P>
   In previous years the bowls have used only the two major polls _
which included the votes of sportswriters and coaches _ to pick the
teams for the national championship game. This new system
interjects more scientific information into the process, not unlike
the Ratings Percentage Index (RPI) used to help determine the field
for the NCAA men's basketball tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Problems still will exist. If there are three undefeated teams,
the BCS Standings would be used to leave one team out of the big
game. The same goes if there is only one unbeaten team and several
with one loss. The numbers will make the decision, and somebody is
not going to be happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We simply felt that the time had come to get as much good
information into the process as we logically could,'' Kramer said.
``Like the polls, this system will have its flaws, and people will
argue about it. But it is an honest attempt to give the public what
it wants, and that's a true national championship game.''
</P>
<P>
   These standings, however, will determine the matchup for the
national championship game only. The other bowls will make their
selections from the remaining conference champions or at-large
teams that qualify by finishing in the top six of the standings.
</P>
<P>
   The top four in the final regular-season polls a year ago _
Michigan, Nebraska, Tennessee, and Florida State _ were the also
the top four under the BCS formula.
</P>
<P>
   Had the current system been in effect a year ago, Nebraska and
Michigan would have played for the national championship. But
Michigan was locked in to the Rose Bowl, where it beat Washington
State and eventually shared the national title with Nebraska, which
beat Tennessee in the Orange Bowl.

 &HT;    Town council agrees to lift Neiman Marcus ad ban
 &HT;    By Tim O'Meilia
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH _ The town council Tuesday, June 9, backed away from
barring Neiman Marcus from advertising on television, radio or in
major local newspapers for a year after it opens.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you impose this condition on this store and not on
every other store on the island?'' asked council President Lesly
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The council reversed itself as it was reviewing an agreement
with landowner Murray Goodman to allow the upscale Dallas-based
retailer to build a three-story store on Worth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Members last week approved the store, contingent on the
advertising ban suggested by Councilman Leslie cq Shaw. Shaw said
he wanted to ensure the store's target customer lives on the
island.
</P>
<P>
   Under town law, larger than 2,000 sq ft stores, restaurants and
other businesses must prove that more than half their customers
live, work or are staying at hotels and homes in Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Town Attorney John Randolph warned the council against telling
merchants how to meet the law. ``I begin having a concern when
you're doing more than requiring them to be town-serving,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   To replace the advertising restriction, the council agreed, 3-2,
to substitute a condition that the store meet the ``town-serving''
requirement.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw and Smith voted against the change. ``I don't think the
(condition) is necessary at all,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Allen Wyett suggested an advertising blackout of
end-of-season sales since they attract the most traffic. Other
council members disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Worth Avenue goes on sale, the world comes,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The council will consider a final draft of the agreement
Thursday.

 &HT;    Former Texas player Pinkney changes attitude, league
 &HT;    By Suzanne Halliburton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ In August 1997 Lovell Pinkney was competing for a
roster spot with the then-Super Bowl champion Green Bay Packers
when he decided he didn't want to be in De Pere, Wis.. Even though
the training camp likely represented his last chance to make it in
the NFL, he no longer had a passion for football.
</P>
<P>
   So he packed his bags and walked out of the team dorm, leaving
his new coaches and teammates wondering what prompted his sudden
departure.
</P>
<P>
   Pinkney, one of the most gifted and most controversial athletes
ever to play for the University of Texas, was troubled. His
61-year-old mother, who was home in Washington, D.C., had suffered
her second heart attack in three years. She needed dialysis
treatment for her ailing kidneys. He also was going through the
breakup of an 18-month marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew if it wasn't fun anymore, I didn't need to be doing
it,'' Pinkney, 25, said of playing football.
</P>
<P>
   Pinkney's attitude, on the field and off, has taken a drastic
turn. He said he has discovered Christianity. His ailing football
pysche also received a jolt of optimism because for at least the
month of May, he was a star in the Arena Football League, which two
years ago he would have considered not worthy of his talents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who knew me then (back in Austin) probably wouldn't
recognize me now,'' Pinkney said during a telephone interview last
week. ``Personality- wise, I'm still the same guy, a fun guy to be
around, that's still the same. But what kind of crowd I hang out
with, my Lord and savior has changed all that now.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinkney moved home last summer to care for his mother, Helen
Lancaster. For several months he worked for a group that lobbies
the U.S. Congress for family- oriented issues. But when he got a
call from Michael Trigg, a former star for the Arena League's
Detroit Drive, Pinkney decided to return to football. He accepted
an invitation to play for Trigg, who coaches the Grand Rapids
(Mich.) Rampage, which in a previous incarnation was the Drive,
winner of four Arena Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   For a month, until he broke his right arm, he was the Rampage's
brightest star, playing wide receiver and linebacker for a team
that sells out its converted hockey arena in a league that requires
all but a handful of players to compete on both offense and
defense. Pinkney even was catching passes from a former rival,
Texas A&AMP;M quarterback Corey Pullig. Defensive tackle Stonie Clark,
Pinkney's former Longhorns teammate, was given a two-day tryout
with the Rampage but was cut.
</P>
<P>
   Most Arena League players make from $500 to $800 a week, but the
stars can make as much as $2,000. The team also pays a player's
rent for the four-month season. Pinkney would not say what he made,
adding that he is honoring the wishes of his coaches not to reveal
his salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``This league really has helped build my self-esteem,'' Pinkney
said. ``It's helped to build my mind-set and make football fun
again. In this league, they score like 50 to 70 points. And the
defensive backs, they're all like 5-6 or 5-7.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-5-inch Pinkney was enjoying his distinct height
advantage, catching 12 passes for 162 yards and four touchdowns in
three games. He also had four tackles, one for a loss, and had
broken up a pass. But his season ended prematurely May 28 when he
broke a bone in his upper right arm trying to make a tackle against
San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame he got hurt, because we were building our team
around him,'' said Tony Lasher, a Rampage spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns once pinned their hopes on Pinkney, who despite
his defensive- end-like size could outrun the quickest running
backs. He was a key recruit in Coach John Mackovic's first class in
1992 and, along with fellow wide receiver Mike Adams, earned a
place on USA Today's freshman All-America team.
</P>
<P>
   But Pinkney, a product of a tough inner-city D.C. neighborhood,
constantly found himself in trouble in Austin. Mackovic benched him
midway through his freshman season for missing class. An off-season
dormitory prank prompted a one- game suspension his sophomore year,
and he was barred from living in the dorm for one year. He was
suspended for a total of three games in 1994, for breaking curfew,
improperly accepting the use of an expensive rental car and
misleading investigators about why he took a spring trip to Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Pinkney declared for the NFL draft in 1995, leaving UT after his
junior season with the school record for career touchdown
receptions (15). He hasn't returned to Austin. However, he is
trying to reestablish ties. Last week he called UT Coach Mack Brown
to wish the new coach well. He also wanted to get back in touch
with Cleve Bryant, the new UT assistant athletic director who as an
assistant under Mackovic recruited Pinkney to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Although Pinkney once was projected as a first-round NFL draft
pick, the St. Louis Rams selected him in the fourth round in 1995.
Teams had questions about Pinkney's suspensions at UT, and they did
not know what position he should play in the pros. In his three
years at UT, he gained about 30 pounds, so that by 1995 he weighed
about 250. He maintained most of his speed but he looked more like
a tight end, albeit a tight end who never had to block.
</P>
<P>
   As a pro, he remained a lightning rod for controversy. He was
suspended for a game with the St. Louis Rams in 1995 because he
missed a practice to attend the Million Man March in Washington. He
was waived the next year. Pinkney's name even was linked to the
suspension last December of Penn State running back Curtis Enis,
who improperly accepted clothes after going on a shopping trip with
agent Jeff Nalley of Houston. Pinkney also was represented by
Nalley, who told Penn State officials the $400 worth of clothing
was meant for Pinkney.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went shopping with Jeff in Pennsylvania,'' Pinkney said.
``But I don't know what happened. I never saw Curtis. I don't know
if people thought I was Curtis or not. Does Curtis favor me? I
don't know what he looks like.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinkney said he has calmed down since college. He became a
Christian two years ago, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of my problem, I was trying to do everything on my own,
instead of allowing God to take over,'' said Pinkney, whose parents
are Muslim but didn't raise their 12 children with those beliefs.
``I remember I was playing for the Rams and this voice kept coming
to me. There was this guy who played for the Rams named Todd
Kinchen, and he was a real good Christian. I asked him about it one
day. We sat in a car in the parking lot of Wendy's for three hours.
He told me the voice I kept hearing was God trying to come in my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinkney started attending a Baptist church in Washington. In
Grand Rapids, he participates in informal, weekly Bible studies
with some of his teammates and in game-day chapel services.
</P>
<P>
   He still dreams of one day playing in the NFL. But he has placed
those dreams on hold because of the fun and acceptance he has had
playing Arena ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a nice town. They're football crazy here,'' Pinkney
said. ``They pack this place every weekend. You know, the New
Orleans Saints called me last year, but I didn't want to go back to
the NFL. They just wanted me for like an insurance tight end. I
like to compete. I don't want to ride the bench. I want to play
ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NFL is not my main focus. I've got some years left in me,
but my main focus right now is to return back to this league.''

 &HT;    Reds revamp while season revs up
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO, Calif. _ With the team spinning its wheels and
apparently on a road to nowhere this season, the Cincinnati Reds
are in full-throttle revamping mode. Shortstop and captain Barry
Larkin, the 34-year-old anchor of the team, is being offered in
trade to several teams, the Dayton Daily News learned recently.
Sources said general manager Jim Bowden has contacted the San Diego
Padres, Los Angeles Dodgers, San Francisco Giants and St. Louis
Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   And Larkin knows it. His agent, Eric Goldschmidt, told Larkin on
June 9 that the Reds are trying to move him.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, the Reds apparently are asking too much for me,''
Larkin said during an early-afternoon special batting practice
session at Qualcomm Stadium. ``They've asked for San Diego's top
three prospects and were told (by San Diego general manager Kevin
Towers), `We wouldn't trade those three for Mo Vaughn.'''
</P>
<P>
   Moving Larkin makes sense for two reasons: The Reds are in a
payroll-reduction mode, and they are in a youth and development
phase in which he doesn't fit.
</P>
<P>
   The longer they wait to move him, the tougher it will be. His
contract this year and next year calls for $5.3 million and another
$5.3 million in 2000 if he makes 525 plate appearances in any of
the next three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting impatiently for his time in the sun is 25-year-old
shortstop Pokey Reese, the team's No. 1 draft choice in 1991, who
is wasting away on the bench. Reese has appeared in 28 games this
season and has started 10 at shortstop, most of those when Larkin
missed the start of the season recovering from neck surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Larkin is hitting .270 with four homers, 26 RBIs and 12 stolen
bases in 13 attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Larkin has professed a desire to finish his career with a
winning team, one with a chance to get him into the World Series
one more time, and it appears it will be too late for him by the
time the Reds complete their rebuilding plans and complete a new
stadium to generate revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know by the time they get done around here what they want to
get done, it'll be too late for me,'' Larkin said. ``Sure, I'd like
a chance to play for a winner, for a team that could use me to help
them win, before I finish.''
</P>
<P>
   Larkin, a Cincinnati native and graduate of Moeller High School,
was the Reds' No. 1 draft pick in 1985 and is the last remnant from
the 1990 World Series champion. He has a career .299 batting
average with 143 home runs, 672 RBIs and 302 stolen bases in his
11-plus seasons with the Reds. He was National League MVP in 1995
when he led the team to the NL Championship Series with a .319
average, 15 home runs, 66 RBIs and 51 stolen bases.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres (Chris Gomez), Giants (Rich Aurilia), Dodgers (Jose
Vizcaino) and Cardinals (Luis Ordaz) all could use a multi-faceted
offensive and defensive shortstop, and they could afford Larkin.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds' payroll is at $22 million; trading Larkin for
prospects would reduce it to less than $17 million.

 &HT;    Lexus making bold pitch for younger buyers
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If Lexus is not changing its image, it is most
certainly expanding it to include an entirely new genre of
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with the bold styling of its lightning-fast GS 400
sedan and continuing with the debut of the RX 300 sport-utility
vehicle, Lexus is seeking to expand its horizons to a broader and
potentially more youthful customer base.
</P>
<P>
   The GS 400's rounded shape exudes the same type of youthful
appeal as Volkswagen's New Beetle. While equally as elegant as the
Lexus LS 400 flagship, this Lexus screams, ``Hey, notice me!'' It
also screams when the driver pushes the accelerator.
</P>
<P>
   Lexus likes to brag about the GS 400's steering-wheel-mounted
button-shift capability, which is derived from Formula One
technology. The irony is that the system is overkill. The GS 400's
five-speed automatic is one of the finest in the industry. In a
spirited test drive, I never once was tempted to use the steering
wheel shifter. The GS's automatic always provided the proper gear
at the proper time.
</P>
<P>
   Stepping even further out on the styling limb is the new RX 300.
My first impression: a copycat of the Mercedes M-Class. Nothing
could be further from the truth. The RX 300 has its own
personality.
</P>
<P>
   Its futuristic styling evokes an almost spaceship type of image,
highlighted with bold headlight and taillight treatments. While
maintaining all the creature comforts synonymous with Lexus, the
futuristic concepts carry on to the RX 300's interior, with the
gearshift lever being mounted in an extension pod of the dashboard.
At first glance, it was a bizarre visual concept, but it proved to
be exceptionally functional.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of this instrument pod is an LCD screen that houses
ventilation, audio, trip computer, outside temperature and clock
functions -- sort of your own personal mini computer monitor.
</P>
<P>
   The best part of the RX 300 is its driveability. Powered by a
3.0-liter, 220-horsepower, four-cam, 24-valve V-6, the RX 300 is
one of the more spirited sport-utilities on the market.
</P>
<P>
   From a ride and handling standpoint, the RX 300 gets a thumbs
up. Not surprisingly, it drives more like a car than its big
brother, the LX470. That's because it is based on a Camry platform
rather than a full boxed frame. It is also exceptionally
maneuverable and parkable.
</P>
<P>
   But don't mistake the RX 300 for a wimpy player. The RX 300's
full-time four-wheel-drive connected with a four-speed automatic
with ``snow mode'' switch can carry soccer moms and business moms
alike through the most treacherous terrain.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Christian Hennings is enthusiastic about his DVD movie player
and the disks that go with it, but it remains to be seen if the
technology mainstream will move in the same direction.
</P>
<P>
   Hennings, a movie buff from Springfield, N.J., jumped into DVD
when it became available about 15 months ago. ``There wasn't
anywhere you could rent disks, so I started buying them right off
for $22 or $24,'' he said. So far, he has bought 50 or 60 movies on
DVD disks to watch on his television set.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little leery when they first came out,'' he said. ``I
always loved laser disk'' _ another disk format for movie
enthusiasts _ ``but now there are a thousand titles on DVD and the
quality is better than laser. And the price makes it awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   But all is not well with DVD, which stands for digital video
disk or digital versatile disk, depending on who is doing the
talking. Movies on DVD are luminous and clear, with a depth of
field that looks very much like what you see in a movie theater.
Yet DVD, promoted as the next hot thing by the home electronics
industry and movie companies, has made a debut that is widely rated
as mildly disappointing or guardedly promising.
</P>
<P>
   For DVD sales to consumers, the industry ``got the early
adopters in the first year,'' said Martin Greenwald, president of
Image Entertainment, a distributor of laser disks and DVDs for
several Hollywood studios. ``The reason DVD hasn't hit a nerve with
videotape buyers is that people don't perceive the economic value
of the product.''
</P>
<P>
   The public seems generally satisfied with the video cassette
recorder and is slow to see a need for DVD movies. Players cost
from $400 to $1,000. Distributors recall that the VCR didn't really
take off until the price fell to $300.
</P>
<P>
   DVD comes in several forms besides DVD-video for playing movies
on television screens. DVD-ROM can run games and other software as
well as movies on computer monitors; it is widely expected to
eventually replace CD-ROM because of its superior storage
capabilities. There are also recordable forms of DVD disks and
Divx, which plays movies on special players. DVD technology for
audio is on the way.
</P>
<P>
   A disagreement in the industry over competing plans for DVD
players is thought to have slowed consumer acceptance of the
format.
</P>
<P>
   It is movie buffs like Hennings who are most interested in the
video end of DVD. About 300,000 DVD video players are now in use, a
far cry from industry predictions of a million or more players by
now. Richard Kelly, president of Cambridge Associates, a consulting
company for disk and tape replicators, said that player sales could
reach 900,000 to a million by the end of this year. He sees steady
if not spectacular growth after that, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see good acceptance,'' he said, ``but I'm not sure
you'll see a player in 10 percent of homes in a couple of years.
There won't be that kind of penetration.''
</P>
<P>
   DVD movies look sharp and clean on computers, which makes the
disks ideal for taking movies along to play on laptops equipped
with DVD-ROM players and for other specialized uses. Otherwise,
computers aren't what most people think of when it comes to a
two-hour feature film. ``I have a 36-inch television, so the idea
of watching movies on a 15-inch computer screen isn't that
appealing,'' Hennings said.
</P>
<P>
   To play DVD movies on a television set, one needs a separate
set-top player that looks like a VCR and, depending on its
features, costs from $400 to $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Do you really need another movie player? That depends. Image and
sound are vastly superior to videotape, but is that important
enough to you to warrant buying a new video system for the
television set?
</P>
<P>
   Like many other movie buffs, Hennings is attracted by the extras
that are on many, but not all, DVD disks: documentaries about the
making of the film, behind-the-scenes interviews and other
supplementary information.
</P>
<P>
   If you aren't entirely sure where you stand on such matters, it
is perhaps best to see DVD in operation, or even to give it a trial
run. Not every video store carries DVD, but ones that do often have
demonstration areas, and some will rent players for trial purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Among the questions a prospective DVD buyer might want to ask
are whether the sparkling, crisp images of DVD, plus the disks'
movie extras, are worth the investment in the first generation of
DVD players.
</P>
<P>
   Another important question is this: Will DVD develop into a mass
commodity, along the lines of VHS and the VCR, which is now in
almost 90 percent of American homes? Or as with the laser disk,
will it always be a niche item for technically inclined film
enthusiasts? Opinions vary wildly, but moderate voices in the
business say that if DVD for television is to enter the mainstream,
it will be bit by bit over the next several years, perhaps faster
if prices drop.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue is the quantity and range of movies available on
DVD. Both Kelly and Greenwald say supply will affect the prices of
both DVD players and DVD movies. ``Studios should get very
interested in DVD after players hit the million mark,'' Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   The more players sold, the more movies will be put on disk, he
said. That, in turn, might stimulate player sales, which will
increase the number of movies available, and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   Will you be able to get all the movies you want when you want
them? With the exception of Fox, which has not entered the DVD
market, all the major studios say they will release movies on DVD.
How many and when is unclear. Now, the vast majority of DVD titles
are older catalog films that appeal to collectors who aren't
necessarily interested in having the latest hit.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest issues for prospective DVD purchasers is the
question of the industry disagreement over the format for DVD
players: DVD vs. Divx. Let's say you want to rent movies and not
buy them. Within the next year, there could be two competing types
of DVD on the market, introducing elements of potential
incompatibility that recall the VHS-Beta competition of the early
80s.

 UNDATED: early 80s. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A format war? Not exactly, but the upshot could be the same.
Both DVD video and Divx offer digital video disks, but the
marketing concepts are different, as are the players, which could
cause a problem if you have one and not the other. The first type
of system, available now, is called open DVD. The second is Divx,
for digital video express, which began tests this week.
</P>
<P>
   Open DVD is designed for collectors like Hennings who buy disks.
Only lately have studios and retailers begun to acknowledge that
many potential DVD consumers want to rent, not buy. Large chains
like Blockbuster and Tower have introduced trial rental programs.
</P>
<P>
   Divx is DVD designed for rentals. You buy a disk for $4.50,
which serves as a base rental fee. For that $4.50, you can watch
the film as many times as you want within 48 hours. If you play the
disk again after that, you pay an extra fee, which is billed
automatically to a credit card via a phone modem in your Divx
player. If you want to buy the movie, you are charged more.
</P>
<P>
   The Divx plan has caused a furor among video dealers who dislike
the idea because people will not have to go back to stores to
return the disks. Critics also say the system is too complicated
for consumers to use easily. Advocates say it is no more
complicated than ordering movies via pay-per-view cable or
satellite.
</P>
<P>
   The studios see advantages in Divx because the system of
consumer payment for movie rentals enables them to collect a fee
for every transaction. Videocassettes, by contrast, are sold to
retailers for one price up front. At present, Paramount, Disney and
Universal say they will put out movies in both open DVD and Divx.
Warner and Columbia-Tri-Star, which inaugurated DVD last year, say
they will stay with only open DVD.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone contemplating getting into DVD, there is a very
important point to remember: all DVD disks will play on Divx
machines, but Divx disks will not function on standard open DVD
players. So should you wait for Divx, a system that isn't ready and
isn't assured of success?
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, Greenwald and most other informed observers say they
expect all the studios to promote rentals and issue movies in both
Divx and open DVD formats. No one expects a repetition of the
VHS-Beta tangle. ``I can't imagine any studio head allowing that to
happen,'' Kelly said.

 &HT;    Test Drive: Lexus RX 300 has plenty of power, with silky comfort
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Try as you might, it's really difficult to couple the
usual sport-utility vehicle-associated phrase ``trucklike'' with
the new-for-'99 Lexus RX 300 sport-utility. The words ``luxury
car-like'' keep getting in the way.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's because of all the leather and real wood that came
with the pearl-painted test RX 300. Or maybe it's because of the
high-end stereo with in-dash six-CD changer, trip computer and
fold/slide rear seats. Then, again, it just may be the
220-horsepower V-6 engine, four-speed automatic transmission and
supple independent suspension that combine to give the RX 300
luxo/sports sedan performance (zero to 60 mph in eight-plus
seconds) and ride on the road.
</P>
<P>
   It's also quite likely these attributes can be traced to the RX
300's heritage, heavily influenced by the Lexus ES 300, the Toyota
Camry and, seemingly, the new and lavishly greeted Mercedes-Benz
M-Class. After all, all those factors are positives in the market
segment catering to status-seeking buyers with money and little
desire to go off-roading.
</P>
<P>
   The RX 300 will go off-road, quite willingly in fact, and is
more manageable for most drivers than the larger, costlier Lexus LX
450. The RX 300 transmission lacks the low range demanded by
serious off-roaders, but the RX 300 has sufficient ground clearance
(7.8 inches), bulk (two tons) and the strength and suspension to
handle moderate off-road jaunts without it or occupants feeling
threatened.
</P>
<P>
   The steering -- too luxury car-like to ever rebound and whang
around your wrists -- is helpful up and down reasonable terrain,
and the power anti-lock disc brakes are very adequate. Still, the
RX 300 and driver can't help but go into a
stranger-in-a-strange-land mode when this gleaming,
upscale-appointed vehicle is slipping around trees and splashing
mud.
</P>
<P>
   A far more natural environment for the RX 300 is found on paved
surfaces, and its real utility comes when it's loaded with people.
The handling is nicely balanced, with little chance of the RX 300
giving an impression of being tippy. Bumps are noted, but not
telegraphed to occupants.
</P>
<P>
   The interior, in addition to being cushy, is quite functional.
The car-type instrumentation and controls, including the shifter
found on the busy center dash, are sensibly arranged. The only
anomaly is the information display screen in the center dash pod
that seems to be waiting for an onboard navigation system to
appear.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond all this and the cachet of Lexus badging, though, what
endows the RX 300 with appeal is precisely what makes the high-end
Lexus 300 and 400 cars winners: sheer power and silky comfort.

 &HT;    Air-conditioning retrofits will be tricky
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Most pre-1994 vehicles used R-12, better known as
Freon, as the refrigerant in their air-conditioning systems. But
because of efforts to protect the ozone layer, the chemical has not
been manufactured since 1995, and the supply is rapidly dwindling.
</P>
<P>
   As these older A/C systems require service and repair, you
eventually will be confronted with the option of retrofitting
(using an alternative refrigerant) your car's air-conditioning
system. One thing all of the replacement refrigerants on the market
have in common is they all require some modification to your
existing A/C system.
</P>
<P>
   What refrigerant and retrofit is right for your car and your
bank account? You might want to carefully weigh the following
before you plunk your money down.
</P>
<P>
   The two most commonly used refrigerants, R-12 and R-134a, are
unmixed, pure refrigerants. Although each requires separate
service/recovery equipment, most shops have invested in the tools
and supplies to service them. Both of these refrigerants can be
completely recycled unless contaminated by either each other or
another chemical.
</P>
<P>
   Cesar Pascual, a local Automotive Service Association shop
owner, meets regularly with the Bottom Line Impact Group, comprised
mainly of other ASA shop people around the country.
</P>
<P>
   He, the group and shop owners around the country unanimously
agree they will not service any vehicle containing refrigerants
other than R-12 or R-134a.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons? Original equipment and aftermarket air-conditioning
component manufacturers will not warranty any A/C parts using
refrigerants other than R-12 or R-134a. And the shops are not going
to incur the additional cost of different chemicals and equipment
every time a new refrigerant hits the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Some refrigerants are now calling themselves safe substitutes
for R-12 and R-134a. Some, primarily FRIGC/FR-12 and Freeze 12, are
likely to be aggressively marketed.
</P>
<P>
   These products probably would work well as replacements for
R-12. Their claims on price, performance and ease of conversion
seem to be valid, but my main concern with them is serviceability
and availability. Their chemical construction and subsequent
service have very little acceptance in the automotive repair field.
</P>
<P>
   FRIGIC/FR-12 and Freeze 12 are blend refrigerants. They use a
combination of chemicals to achieve cooling. Each requires its own
service/recovery equipment, tools and supplies. Neither can be
recycled. They must be recovered in containers and shipped back to
the manufacturer for disposal. That means serviceability of A/C
systems containing this stuff will be extremely limited.
</P>
<P>
   If your air conditioning conks out in the middle of Kansas or
Wyoming, the rest of the vacation could well be spent with the
windows down unless you can find a shop that has this particular
refrigerant setup.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you've decided by now that the new alternative
refrigerants are not for your car, you're not out of the woods yet.
Used vehicles, especially those from auto auctions or buy here/pay
here lots, are prime candidates for a cheap and easy retrofit. It
is a good idea before purchasing any used vehicle to have its
refrigerant content checked along with the standard used-car
check-out.
</P>
<P>
   The standard procedure in most shops for a customer who needs
A/C service will be to identify, or ``sniff,'' the vehicle's
refrigerant. If anything other than pure R-12 or R-134a is
detected, the vehicle will be sent away. It's up to the customer to
find a shop that will work on the system.
</P>
<P>
   We have all purchased products that appeared inexpensive or
economical, only to find the replacement part costs astronomical,
if available, or that service was nonexistent.

because of all the leather and real wood that came with the

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Very warm and humid air will make slow progress toward the
Northeast as high pressure moves farther off the New England coast.
The leading edge of the sultry air will reach from North Carolina
to northern Iowa. Winds at 5,000 feet will transport large amounts
of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico into the central Appalachians
and Ohio Valley.
</P>
<P>
   A few disturbances in the jet stream will intersect this current
of humid air, leading to the development of several clusters of
thunderstorms from southern Michigan to western Virginia. Hail and
flooding rains are likely with these storms.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds will encroach on the Northeast, but most sections will
stay dry and central New England may remain sunny. Showers,
associated with advancing summery weather, will dampen
Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and western New York. In the
Middle Atlantic region, onshore winds will combine with thick
clouds to keep readings below seasonal levels.
</P>
<P>
   It will be steamy across most of the South with isolated thunder
in Florida. The progression of hot, dry air from Old Mexico into
the western Plains will lead to thunderstorms along the dry line
from the Big Bend to east central Kansas. In the vicinity of low
pressure over Iowa, a cluster of strong to severe thunderstorms may
form later in the day. The upper Middle West will be dull, damp and
mild.
</P>
<P>
   A cold front progressing into the Central Rockies will be
accompanied by thundershowers and followed by cooler, gusty winds.
A strong disturbance moving southward in California will promote
showers in the Central Valley and along the central coast.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Sprouting from the Ashes
</P>
<P>
   Fires continued to rage across northern and central Florida on
Wednesday. Anomalously dry, sunny weather has parched the area,
with some locations receiving less than half of their average
spring rains. Daytona Beach received a paltry 0.16 inch of rain in
May, which is only 5 percent of normal. While the fires wreak havoc
on area homes, the pine forests that cover the landscape of much of
Florida ironically benefit from the fires. Seeds in the pine cones
produced by the trees are released by the heat of the fires,
allowing new trees to germinate and replace aging trees in the
canopy.

 GEEK NOTES: Amazon Offering CD Music; Offerings of Y2K Fixes; Nader
Weighs In on Microsoft; Questions About Online Sex Survey; How Low
Will PC Prices Go?  
(ja) 
 By KATIE HAFNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Amazon Offering CD Music  &LR;  What a drumroll. Practically since
the day it opened three years ago, Amazon.com, the popular on-line
bookstore, has been considering an expansion into the audio CD
business. Finally, after dozens of focus groups and months of
building an editorial staff well versed in music, Amazon has
started selling tunes along with its books.
</P>
<P>
   The new music site certainly looks impressive. Customer
critiques get posted just as they do in the book section, and many
music categories are accompanied by primers. The catalog contains
more than 100,000 CD's, with 225,000 songs to sample using Real
Audio.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon executives recognize that book buyers and music buyers
can be very different breeds. ``Music people tend to take music
almost more personally than books,'' said David Risher, Amazon's
senior vice president for product development and marketing. ``You
don't hear people saying, `I hate biography, it makes my skin
crawl.' But talk to a jazz enthusiast and bring up New Age jazz
lite, and they'll break out into a rage.''
</P>
<P>
   When Amazon first began selling books on line, it largely had
the field to itself, but it faces well-established competition in
on-line music retailing. Music Boulevard  &UR; (www.musicblvd. &LR;   &UR; com) &LR; ,
CDnow  &UR; (www.cdnow.com) &LR;  and Tower Records  &UR; (www.towerrecords.com) &LR; 
are already far ahead of Amazon. Barnes &AMP; Noble is likely to enter
the audio CD business as well. Moreover, Amazon has yet to turn a
profit, and the pressure to keep spending money on building the
music business isn't likely to help its cause.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Borders and Bertelsmann are each venturing
into the on-line book retail market, as is W.H. Smith, of England,
with its purchase this week of  &UR; bookshop.co.uk &LR; , Europe's largest
Internet bookstore. Amazon can ill afford to get too distracted by
music.
</P>
<P>
   For now at least, Amazon officials are not including classical
music in the inventory, having decided that the vast library of
classical recordings is too problematic and complex.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Offerings of Y2K Fixes  &LR;  Beware of geeks bearing gifts. Lendlin
Limited, based in Britain, has made the exaggerated claim that ``99
percent of PCs in every office, factory, hospital, etc., will crash
at midnight Dec. 31, 1999, unless their programs are checked and
modified.'' For $15, the company will send you a program that tests
your machine, or you can download it free. For an additional $39.95
plus postage, you can buy a program that fixes the bug.
</P>
<P>
   The computer millennium glitch, or, as it is also known, the
Year 2000 bug, is a problem that primarily affects mainframe
computers that were programmed way back in the 1960s and 1970s to
recognize two digits for dates instead of four. Such computers
would interpret 2010, for example, as 1910.
</P>
<P>
   The digital apocalypse that some Cassandras _ consultants,
mostly _ expect to befall the planet come midnight on Dec. 31,
1999, should spare most personal computers, which each have a BIOS
(basic input/output system _ the software that starts the computer)
that contains the machine's internal clock.
</P>
<P>
   All Apple Macintoshes will accept the date change, and most PCs
made after 1995 are supposed to. Older PCs, running on 386 and 486
chips, may need a BIOS upgrade. Newer machines, even if they have a
problem, can be fixed easily by resetting the date with Windows or
DOS commands.
</P>
<P>
   If you are unsure about whether your BIOS will trip on the new
date, it is probably best to ask the computer's manufacturer. For
applications, like Microsoft Word or Intuit's Quicken, call the
software company and ask whether your program will recognize the
date change.
</P>
<P>
   Testing programs can also be downloaded free from several
Internet sites, including Survive 2000  &UR; (www.sbhs.com) &LR;  and YMark
2000  &UR; (www.nstl.com) &LR; . But be warned when using these tests. They
might cause your applications to lose data or expire.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Nader Weighs In on Microsoft  &LR;  As part of a year-old crusade
against Microsoft's dominance, the longtime consumer advocate Ralph
Nader has written to the chairman of International Business
Machines, Louis V. Gerstner, to say he thinks IBM should make
public the source code for its moribund OS/2 operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Nader's reasoning is this: If OS/2 source code were freely
available, developers of application programs would jump at the
chance to write programs to run on OS/2, building a strong
alternative to Microsoft and Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Nader said in his letter, IBM should offer OS/2 as a
free option when selling its own computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were surprised to learn that IBM will not permit consumers
to buy IBM Aptiva computers with IBM's OS/2 operating system
installed,'' Nader wrote. ``The only way to get OS/2 is to buy a PC
with Microsoft Windows 95 installed and then pay an extra $199 for
a shrink-wrapped copy of OS/2, which consumers will have to install
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Windows is so well entrenched on desktop computers that even IBM
shifted its strategy toward the Microsoft product. For a brief
period three years ago, IBM offered a feature called
Select-a-System, which allowed customers to choose between OS/2 and
Windows when starting up their computers. The majority chose
Windows, and IBM discontinued the program shortly thereafter. OS/2
is now used almost exclusively as a server operating system in
large corporations.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was also signed by Jamie Love, director of the
Consumer Project on Technology in Washington, who said he and Nader
had received several letters of support from OS/2 users. But they
have yet to get a response from IBM.
</P>
<P>
   Nader said in an interview: ``IBM stands for Intimidated by
Microsoft. They're doing in their own product, for heaven's sake.
It just shows you the power of Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   Tara Sexton, an IBM spokeswoman, said Gerstner was traveling and
had not yet seen the letter.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Questions About Online Sex Survey  &LR;  A survey of more than 9,000
MSNBC.com readers about their online sexual habits has generated
skepticism about the study's scientific soundness.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, 47 questions for people who had visited at least one
sex site, was posted on the MSNBC Web site over a seven-week period
in March and April.
</P>
<P>
   According to the preliminary findings, released earlier this
week, five times as many men than women responded to the survey.
Young women appear to be turning to cybersex sites in surprisingly
high numbers, more men look at visually explicit Web sites, and
more women visit sex-oriented chat rooms, the survey found.
</P>
<P>
   The survey's director, Alvin Cooper, who runs a clinic for
marital and sexuality counseling in San Jose, Calif., said the
results confirmed what he had already suspected: online, at least,
women want relationships, and men want pictures.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, which has not been published in a scientific
journal, has many problems, its critics say. ``Not only was it not
random, but the self-selected sample is severely biased since you
had to have visited a sex site to participate,'' said Donna
Hoffman, an associate professor in the Owen School of Management at
Vanderbilt University. The survey, she said, should not be taken to
represent legitimate scientific research about the link between
human sexual behavior and its relation to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fun survey that tells something about what the people
who filled it out think about sex on the Net,'' Hoffman said. ``But
that's all it tells.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper agreed that the survey had its limitations but said:
``There are all kinds of ways to do science. Most people I know who
are familiar with sex and the Internet think this is a landmark
study.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; How Low Will PC Prices Go?  &LR;  Just when it seemed safe to buy a
new computer, along comes another prediction of an imminent plunge
in PC prices. Last week, Ziff-Davis Market Intelligence predicted a
new shift downward. By the middle of next month, the report said,
the prices of computers selling for $1,000 will drop to $700 or
$800. And the price of a decent 17-inch color monitor will fall to
about $350. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As a result of lower prices, the Ziff-Davis research group
declared, the number of homes in the United States with at least

CROONER TAKES ADVANTAGE OF NEWFOUND FAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDY CORDOVA  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) - Everywhere Vonda Shepard goes, the question follows
her. It's enough to make her want to scream sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   It has nothing to do with the music on her albums, the songs she
writes, even the way she sings.
</P>
<P>
   ``People always ask me, `How are you like Ally McBeal?' ''
Shepard says, calling from an Austin hotel room. ``And you didn't
ask me that _ yippee!''
</P>
<P>
   Her exuberance is understandable. After all, her career includes
five solo albums, backup work with Jackson Browne and Rickie Lee
Jones, even a hit duet with Dan Hill. But it took the quirky charms
of David E. Kelley's Fox sitcom to turn her into a household voice.
</P>
<P>
   That's Shepard's dusky, stars-at-midnight croon that sings the
lyrics that parallel the inner workings of the title character.
</P>
<P>
   She also appears on camera: Shepard is the ripe-looking blond
who performs in the saloon frequented by the show's cast members.
</P>
<P>
   At first, ``Ally McBeal'' seemed like it would be just another
job for the piano-playing New Yorker. But the offbeat comedy about
a career woman caught on with viewers, becoming something of a
phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see it coming at all,'' a cheerful Shepard says. ``I
thought I was going to have a few songs in this show. Even once I
was on camera, with a regular gig working in the studio every week,
I didn't see it coming.''
</P>
<P>
   As the show grew in popularity, so did the call for Shepard's
music, which is featured in every episode.
</P>
<P>
   ``David started joking about doing a soundtrack, because he
wanted a CD for his own car,'' she says. ``Next thing I know, major
labels are calling about it. It was just wild.''
</P>
<P>
   Sony won the bidding war, and ``Songs From Ally McBeal'' has
been sitting in the nation's Top 10 since its release last month.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad, especially for a performer who had scrapbooks full of
rave reviews but little luck achieving widespread success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can't We Try,'' a rather anonymous duet with Canadian
balladeer Dan Hill, was a huge hit in 1987. But the next 10 years
of Shepard's shadowy career were marked by albums that sold only to
the converted. Her songwriting was sharp and literate, but it was a
small, select audience that clued in to what she was doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in my career when I was not so well-known, people would
say, `God, you're so comfortable onstage,' '' she says. ``That was
a compliment, but it was also very frustrating. This last month and
a half, working on this large a scale, it's just been very
exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to ``Ally McBeal,'' it's been a huge jump. A year ago you
could find her performing for small audiences at intimate LA
nightspots.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is definitely the right time for all that's happened,''
she says. ``I'm just so thankful. I'm 34 years old. I have all this
energy, and I just love to work. It was driving me crazy, sitting
at home waiting for things to happen. Now it's time, and I want to
take advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   But every rose comes with its thorns. For example, ``Songs From
Ally McBeal'' may be sitting in a lot of people's homes, but it's
series star Calista Flockhart's face that smiles out from the front
cover. Shepard makes do with a photo on the rear.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a strange, surreal feeling to be connected with a
TV show,'' she says. ``I'm sort of removed from it in a way. I
mean, it really makes sense to have her picture on there _ it is a
show about Ally McBeal. But the next one will definitely have my
picture on the front.''
</P>
<P>
   The next ``Ally'' disc, which is due after Shepard's next
non-``McBeal'' album appears later this year, will include a
greater number of original tunes. Much of the current album is
packed with covers of songs such as ``I Only Want to Be With You,''
`You
</P>
<P>
   Belong to Me'' and ``Walk Away Renee.''
</P>
<P>
   She handles the familiar tunes with verve and style, but she's
still a songwriter performing other people's songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, I'm sighing a big sigh,'' she says with a giggle.
``Through this medium, I've been able to expose people to the
original material, which is closest to my heart. I think of myself
as a writer as opposed to a singer, so it's strange.''
</P>
<P>
   A form of amends comes when she performs in concert. She sees
the enthusiastic way audiences respond to the cover tunes, most
which have played integral parts in ``Ally'' episodes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll play something like ``Hooked on a Feeling'' and I see the
fun people are having,'' she says. ``The audiences are very
high-energy and very excited to be there. There's a lighthearted
spirit to the whole thing, because the show has a lighthearted
spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   But being a human karaoke machine, even one with a great
pedigree and a terrific set of pipes, was not part of Shepard's
game plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand, I'm the same person who writes very
diligently and spends a year perfecting a song,'' she says.
``Honestly, I guess I just don't want to be a novelty through
``Ally McBeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, that's the big fear. Here's a gifted woman who has been
working at her craft since she was 14 years old. She doesn't want
to become this year's version of the Rembrandts, the Heights, or,
God forbid, Cyndi Grecco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping that won't happen,'' she says. ``Hopefully, people
at the live shows will buy the older albums. They'll connect with
my songs. I mean, ``Ally McBeal'' is so different from other TV
shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent so much time gearing the music exactly for the show,
but it had to fit my own personal specifications as an artist.
Hopefully, people will realize that.'' &QL;

DOES SHAKESPEARE REALLY NEED B-12 SHOTS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., June 14 ) 
 (JT)  
 By VINCENT CANBY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There probably isn't a scholar or critic in the world
who would rate ``Henry VIII'' as one of Shakespeare's great history
plays. It possesses no grandly iconic heroes or villains of
diabolic ambitions. It contains no patches of soaring verse and
commemorates no single splendid event that forever changed the
course of the British monarchy. It is essentially a
patched-together propaganda piece.
</P>
<P>
   The general belief today is that Shakespeare himself wrote less
than half the text, and that John Fletcher and others were
responsible for the rest. Part pageant, part history, the play
seems to have been composed quickly and to order, possibly to
celebrate the marriage of James I's daughter in 1613.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as presented by the Royal Shakespeare Company during its
recent 18-day residency at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, ``Henry
VIII'' is suddenly revealed to be a vivid and compelling theatrical
artifact. Here is an emotionally charged, early-17th-century
docudrama, gorgeously designed and costumed, acted cleanly and
without affectation, as engaging to the intellect for the history
it omits as for the history it embraces.
</P>
<P>
   This production is the kind of discovery that is expected of the
giant, financially besieged RSC, which maintains three theaters in
Stratford-on-Avon and two at the Barbican Center in London, tours
regularly in Britain and abroad and has 29 productions in its
current repertory. Certainly, ``Henry VIII'' is the most fully
realized of the three Shakespeare productions in the company's
five-play touring repertory, which, following its Brooklyn
engagement, is now at the Kennedy Center in Washington through July
5.
</P>
<P>
   Though this tour was designed to show off the RSC to advantage
(and could, if successful, become a recurring event), it also
demonstrates why London press support for the company has eroded.
Some English critics argue that the RSC isn't adventurous in either
its choice of plays or approach to the productions it chooses to
stage. They also worry that many of its productions simply aren't
good enough.
</P>
<P>
   Because Americans aren't often bombarded by competing
conceptions of ``King Lear'' or ``Henry V'' or ``Hamlet,'' we're
inclined to be grateful for any halfway decent Shakespeare that
comes along. We can't easily yawn at the prospect of another more
or less conventional ``Julius Caesar'' when we haven't seen any
major productions of ``Julius Caesar'' in years.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the Americans' surprise and disappointment when the RSC
comes over and, in addition to the seldom seen ``Henry VIII,''
presents fancified though indifferently performed productions of
``Hamlet'' and ``Cymbeline.'' Even its production of Samuel
Beckett's ``Krapp's Last Tape,'' starring Edward Petherbridge, is a
letdown. It is a perfunctory staging of the classic that David
Kelly of the Gate Theater of Dublin performed so exquisitely during
the 1996 Lincoln Center Festival. (I missed ``Everyman,'' the
medieval morality play that is also in the RSC touring repertory.)
</P>
<P>
   Unlike ``Henry VIII,'' which was presented at the comparatively
intimate Majestic Theater, both ``Hamlet'' and ``Cymbeline'' were
seen in the cavernous BAM Opera House, where, even if you are
seated in the middle of the orchestra, you seem to be miles from
the stage. Spoken words have a way of going astray when lobbed from
the stage out to the distant audience. Acoustics, however, are not
the only problem. Concepts also interfere.
</P>
<P>
   The RSC's cinematically inspired ``Hamlet'' begins promisingly,
though irrelevantly, with home movies (Hamlet as a small boy,
playing with his father in the family compound). It then jumps to
``the present'': what looks to be a madcap Long Island evening
party, complete with a large swing band, on the occasion of the
marriage of Claudius and Gertrude. Pay no attention to the
dialogue, which still contains references to kings and queens and
such. Claudius could be the new head of his late brother's
brokerage firm, Gertrude a bored, middle-aged socialite who winters
in Barbados, and Hamlet a Yale student who drinks too much.
</P>
<P>
   As with so many attempts to update and find contemporary
associations to the classics, this concept has no place to go once
it is established. It simply gets in the way. Reducing the members
of this lusting, neurotic royal family to the status of the haute
bourgeoisie, circa 1950, also reduces the stakes, makes the
governing passions seem petty and renders the violence more wanton
than inevitable. The concept doesn't seem to have been thought
through. When Laertes comes on carrying a rifle and looking for
Hamlet, you might think he had been hunting squirrels.
</P>
<P>
   The language is all but lost amid these bizarre images. Alex
Jennings's Hamlet is likely to be remembered more for his wardrobe,
his decadent good looks (and the white-painted face he affects at
one point) than for anything he says. This is a Hamlet in which the
gravedigger sings ``September Song,'' Ophelia wears red shoes in
her mad scene (evoking Judy Garland in ``The Wizard of Oz'') and
the Ghost turns up in a dinner jacket. Every now and then, when you
hear a familiar speech, it seems to be a mistake, as if the
soundtrack from another movie were butting in.
</P>
<P>
   Performances are impossible to judge in these circumstances.
Susannah York, a most appealing and sexy actress on the screen,
appears to be distant, small and unnaturally quiet as Gertrude.
This isn't necessarily her fault: the entire play is like a badly
edited film composed entirely of longshots. Matthew Warchus, who
staged the hit productions of ``Art'' in London and New York, is
the director.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Noble, the RSC's artistic director, is responsible for
``Cymbeline,'' though one wonders how he finds the time to direct
individual productions when he is also expected to administer the
company's $50 million yearly budget, attend to the needs of its 750
employees, oversee 2,100 annual performances and, in his spare
time, raise private money to supplement the company's ever smaller
state subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   However he budgets his time, ``Cymbeline'' is something of an
improvement over ``Hamlet,'' if only because the production's
concept affects only the costumes and the spare but handsome set
design. The inspiration is said to be Kabuki, but it looks to be
almost as Chinese as Japanese. The nobly born characters wear
great, handsome kimonolike costumes, while the servants are dressed
in the sort of trousers, jackets and pillbox hats worn by coolies
in old movies of ``Shanghai Express'' vintage.
</P>
<P>
   No matter, since reality isn't the point. ``Cymbeline'' is a
shimmering fairy tale, far less difficult to follow than it is to
synopsize, being about (among other things): a foolish king
(Cymbeline); his virtuous but spunky daughter (Imogen); her
doubting husband (Posthumus); her evil stepmother; Post-humus's
treacherous, lecherous friend; banishments; mistaken identities;
long-lost children; decapitation; resurrections from the dead, and,
ultimately, forgiveness for almost everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Noble's production looks good, but it slides too smoothly
through the fanciful events of the play without ever finding the
appeal or truth of its characters. With two exceptions, most of the
principal performances are astonishingly superficial, composed of
actorly readings and the sort of royal gestures you may not have
seen in years. Note Cymbeline and his queen as they sweep around
the stage, declaiming in their voluminous kimonos and kicking their
trains behind them. Watching this production you might suspect that
train-kicking is taught along with fencing at British drama
schools.
</P>
<P>
   In the pivotal role of Imogen, Joanne Pearce is pretty,
spirited, husky-voiced and commanding, very much the modern woman
that George Bernard Shaw admired in the character. The other
noteworthy performance is that of Guy Henry, who plays Cloten, the
queen's dimwitted twit of a son. Henry doesn't let his broadly
comic lines go without savoring them a bit too long, but he is in
touch with his role and with the sense of the play.
</P>
<P>
   Though Shaw wrote that ``Cymbeline'' is ``for the most part
stagy trash of the lowest melodramatic order,'' he also admitted,
``I pity the man who cannot enjoy Shakespeare.'' He was
sufficiently hooked by the play to write his own substitute last
act, published in 1938 as ``Cymbeline Refinished.'' According to
Shaw, the emancipated Imogen refuses to be reunited happily ever
after with her Posthumus and goes her own way.
</P>
<P>
   O rare G.B.S.!
</P>
<P>
   Compared to ``Hamlet'' and ``Cymbeline,'' Gregory Doran's
production of ``Henry VIII'' is a vigorous, clear-eyed, unhackneyed
delight. Its focus: the plight of Katherine of Aragon, Henry's
first wife, whom he's in the process of dumping in favor of Anne
Bullen (Boleyn), soon to be the mother of Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
   That such a play, written so soon after Queen Elizabeth's death
in 1603, could present a strong, sympathetic portrayal of Katherine
seems odd, especially since the play ends on the triumphant note of
Elizabeth's birth and christening. Poor, soon to be headless, Anne
figures hardly at all in the drama, which also deals with the fall
from favor and execution of Cardinal Wolsey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Henry VIII'' or ``All Is True,'' as it was known to
contemporary audiences, is a treasure trove of what today look like
contradictory political impulses.
</P>
<P>
   The familiar Holbein portrait of Henry is recalled early in the
production, but the role, and Paul Jesson's measured performance of
it, are otherwise free of cliches and, for that matter, all
idiosyncratic particulars. Instead of leaving a vacuum at the
center of the play, this creates a kind of mystery that prompts not
boredom but speculation. Like the god he was when he ruled, Henry
appears to be accessible while remaining unknowable.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Lapotaire is very fine as the abandoned wife who
tenaciously fights Henry all the way to her eventual house arrest
in a second-class castle. It's a tough, proud, unsentimental
performance by the actress who, four years ago, starred in the
RSC's memorable revival of ``Ghosts.'' If you have the chance, note
also Ian Hogg's excellent portrayal of Wolsey, the worldly prince
of the church who was both perpetrator and victim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Henry VIII'' is a most entertaining minor drama about which we
know even less than we do about Shakespeare. One fact is
documented: it can be incendiary. In the course of a performance of
the play on June 29, 1613, the Globe Theater burned to the ground,
the thatched roof apparently ignited by the debris from a fiery
special effect. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ Scarcely will the curtain have rung down on his

the star Vladimir Malakhov will vault across the plaza at Lincoln
Center to the New York State Theater to dance Romeo in the opening
of the Stuttgart Ballet's ``Romeo and Juliet.'' When the curtain
rises on the Lincoln Center Festival '98 attraction on July 7,
Yseult Lendvai will dance Juliet, and the former Stuttgart prima
ballerina Marcia Haydee will be Lady Capulet. Malakhov, whose run
with American Ballet Theater ends three days earlier, will also

   NEW YORK _ Commemorating the 100th anniversary of the birth of
Peggy Guggenheim, the Solomon Guggenheim Museum will trace the life
of this champion of contemporary art in an exhibition that opens
Friday. With paintings, sculptures, photographs and other

   NEW YORK _ What is billed as the first major exhibition in some
20 years to be devoted to George Segal is to open on Sunday at the
Jewish Museum. The exhibition features works from 1958 to 1996 by
the Pop artist known for evocative sculptures of everyday people in
urban environments. Besides his freestanding sculptures, the

FEMALE DEEJAYS READY TO BE JUST PLAIN DEEJAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DOROTHY PARVAZ and DAVID PROFFITT  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) - Pop quiz: Name some hot hip-hop deejays.
</P>
<P>
   OK, who did you come up with? Rob Swift (of the X-ecutioners)?
Gearhead? Invisibl Skratch Piklz? DJ Faust?
</P>
<P>
   You're more or less on track. These guys are some of the top
spinners in the business.
</P>
<P>
   Now try and think of some female deejays.
</P>
<P>
   Go ahead, take your time.
</P>
<P>
   Boy oh boy, where are all the girls? They're out there, you just
don't hear much about them.
</P>
<P>
   A few female deejays across the country and in Arizona are
starting to make noise, but they still run into the attitude that
they're ``just girls'' who are hired by promoters who want to prove
their political correctness.
</P>
<P>
   It's a distinction that many of them wish would disappear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids don't really care (about the deejay's gender),'' says
Mara, a Phoenix area deejay who spins mostly electro, breakbeat and
house. ``The only people it really matters to are the promoter and
the other deejays . . . and it disappoints me that they're not
looking at who plays well.''
</P>
<P>
   She says everyone is too focused on bean counting.
</P>
<P>
   After all, promoters benefit from a gender gap because they can
say they've got female deejays on their fliers. But the problem is
that they still don't expect much from female deejays.
</P>
<P>
   Women get the gigs, but they don't get the respect. And the one
thing they'd like to see change _ that they're viewed as novelty
acts _ is precisely what gets them a lot of their gigs.
</P>
<P>
   The irony isn't lost on the deejays. Still, they'd rather
sacrifice a night's pay than play a gig they don't deserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're hiring me just because I'm a girl, I won't play for
you,'' Mara says. ``If you're good enough to be up there (on the
deejay stand), it shouldn't matter if you're a girl, a boy,
whatever. That's the thing that upsets me about people hiring
female deejays _ you wouldn't hire a male if he sucks.''
</P>
<P>
   After playing a couple of parties where she felt like she only
got a spot because she's female, she avoids becoming the token
woman on the flier by asking promoters who else is spinning and why
they asked her before agreeing to play.
</P>
<P>
   Mara's been playing out for about four years _ practically an
era in the high-turnover world of dance music _ but she says she
doesn't always get the same respect as her male counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   DJ Symphony, the sole female member of the Beat Junkies, a Los
Angeles-based hip-hop crew, says women probably view deejaying as a
guy thing, while men don't take their female counterparts
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the male friends that have turntables might view a
girl as a groupie,'' she says, recalling how a woman she knew of
lost interest in deejaying. ``I guess they just sent her little
subliminal messages.''
</P>
<P>
   Other female deejays are beating the odds, such as the Valley's
Miss Jag, who started spinning darkstep and techstep jungle about a
year ago on a friend's decks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said that I had natural beat-matching skills,'' she says.
``We ran out to Swell (Clothing and Records in Tempe), and he
bought me five or six records and told me to practice.''
</P>
<P>
   So she did.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of practice hours and a few dozen record purchases
later, she got a gig. Then another, and then another.
</P>
<P>
   Now she's getting out-of-state bookings and is about to come out
with her first mix tape.
</P>
<P>
   She said that being female definitely helped her get attention,
but that focusing on an accident of genetics takes attention away
from the most important thing for deejays _ how well they play the
music.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it should matter _ what would happen if I
dressed up like a guy? Would I get the attention? Probably not,''
she says. ``I think it's great to get attention, but I just want to
be known as a deejay.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucson deejay Lady Jane also started spinning jungle about a
year ago, and she's had the same quick rise as Miss Jag.
</P>
<P>
   At one point male deejays were asking (beginital)her (endital)
to help them get jobs, an uncomfortable experience since they'd
been spinning two or three times longer than she had.
</P>
<P>
   She attributes this to female deejays' being something of a
novelty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Promoters talk to so many guys, they must feel like it's the
same thing all the time,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But in the long run, deejays will earn respect for solid skills,
not the type of hormones they have.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great that some people are like, `Girl deejays!
We need more!' but that's not it for me,'' Miss Jag says. ``For me,
it comes down to the music.''
</P>
<P>
   Such success could open the field to more women. San Jose-based
DJ Dazy is optimistic. She runs an online mailing list called
``sisterdjs'' from her Web site (www.djdazy.com), with about 90
subscribers worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot more female deejays everywhere,'' Dazy says.
``When I first started deejaying six years ago, I could count all
the women deejays on my hands. I think in the next couple years we
are going to see (beginital) a lot (end ital) more female deejays
playing out.'' &QL;

SAN FRANCISCO CONSIDERS SUICIDE BARRIER FOR GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY DELGADO  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As tourists and locals both know so well, the
Golden Gate Bridge offers breathtaking views of San Francisco, the
Bay, Alcatraz and more.
</P>
<P>
   But the bridge's darker draw is well documented too: more than
1,200 people have jumped to their deaths by simply leaping over its
four-foot railing.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to prevent that loss of life, Bridge District
officials on Tuesday unveiled a 100-foot expanse of horizontal
steel wiring that could someday run the entire length of the bridge
as a suicide barrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our best effort with the least impact (on
aesthetics),'' said district engineer Merv Giacomini, anticipating
the expected public criticism of a barrier placed on the famous
bridge.
</P>
<P>
   The Golden Gate Bridge, which crosses the San Francisco Bay to
connect the city with Marin County, has two huge towers more than
700 feet tall. The bridge itself is 220 feet above the water.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction already has been mixed to plans for a suicide barrier.
</P>
<P>
   Tourist Nicole Houck of Seattle questioned the need for a
suicide barrier on such a historic bridge, objecting to anything
that obstructs the views.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a person wants to commit suicide, they'll find a way to do
it even if it's not on the bridge,'' Houck, 28, said.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Killebrew of Alameda, Calif., had a different opinion,
having lost a daughter to suicide on the bridge 27 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been vitally interested intrying to prevent others from
doing what my daughter did,'' Killebrew said. ``If this can work
... then I'm all for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The barrier, designed by Z-Clip International Fence Systems, is
made of horizontal, high-tension steel wires spaced 4 inches apart
with fasteners every 6 feet or so. The design has been used for
agriculture and security purposes, but never on a bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the district has considered roughly 20 other
proposals, including a barbed wire fence, U-shaped spikes on top of
the rail, a clear plastic screen and a low-voltage electric fence.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed barrier would have to clear numerous hurdles. First
would be a series of tests to determine if a suicidal person would
be able to scale the 11-foot high fence or cut through it.
</P>
<P>
   Should it prove a successful deterrent, the barrier would then
have clear state and federal historic and aesthetic regulations.
The final challenge would be for the bridge district to fund the $2
million to $3 million project.
</P>
<P>
   Suicide prevention experts have lobbied hard for the barrier,
saying it will be an effective deterrent for many of the impulsive
individuals who want to commit suicide from the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bridge is so easily available,'' said Dr. Richard Seiden,
a psychiatrist who studied several hundred people who were stopped
from jumping from the bridge. ``There is a mystical quality to it.
A barrier would make it more difficult. The feelings of suicide
usually pass. It's a permanent solution to a temporary problem.''

GETTING A HEAD ON STRAIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Friday June 12)  
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Say what you want about our accuracy, our credibility or our
hidden political agendas: Newspapers are still No. 1 when it comes
to goofy headlines.
</P>
<P>
   What follows are actual headlines taken from actual newspapers
produced by actual people who may or may not have been actually
awake at the time:
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN BF)Hospitals Are Sued by 7 Foot Doctors(END BF)
</P>
<P>
   Why are all these extremely tall doctors suing hospitals? Was it
a discrimination thing or does it have to do with uncomfortably low
doorways or the lack of basketball courts in the operating rooms?
Or were these doctors normal-sized until they started eating the
hospital cafeteria food? I've always suspected that hospital
gelatin contained some sort of a radioactive substance.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN BF)Ban on Soliciting Dead in Trotwood(END BF)
</P>
<P>
   Well, good for Trotwood! The dead have enough to worry about,
what with decomposition and maggots and everything, without having
to put up with a bunch of overeager solicitors trying to sell them
credit cards or air conditioner tuneups. Now if Trotwood can just
take it one step further and ban soliciting of the living, then it
would really be on to something.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN BF)Local High School Dropouts Cut in Half(END BF)
</P>
<P>
   While I agree that we should do everything we can to encourage
kids to get an education, this seems a bit extreme. Perhaps we
should first suggest counseling or maybe even vo-tech before we cut
them in half.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN BF)Teacher Strikes Idle Kids(END BF)
</P>
<P>
   Once again, I have to think that this is the wrong approach to
achieving academic excellence. I don't approve of corporal
punishment in any form, but to strike kids who are just sitting
there doing nothing seems flat-out cruel. Just the same, if I were
in that class, I'd make sure I stayed busy.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN BF)Juvenile Court to Try Shooting Defendant(END BF)
</P>
<P>
   Man, it's tough being a kid these days! You drop out of high
school and they cut you in half; you sit there doing nothing and
they strike you; and you make a mistake and wind up in juvenile
court and they try to shoot you! I'm as worried about juvenile
crime as the next person, but I think we're going way over the line
here. Sure, he might deserve to be shot if he's guilty, but what if
he's not? And what if all he did was steal a bicycle or soap some
windows? Does he deserve to be shot for that? All I can say is glad
not a kid anymore because Id look like a piece of Swiss cheese.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN BF)Cold Wave Linked to Temperatures(END BF)
</P>
<P>
   Well, that's good to know. I always figured it had something to
do with the Asian stock market or maybe Monica Lewinsky. But what
kind of temperatures are we talking about here? Cold temperatures?
Hot temperatures? Middle-of-the-road temperatures? Clearly, we need
to fork over a big wad of federal grant money so this matter can be
studied in more detail.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN BF)Survivor of Siamese Twins Joins Parents(END BF)
</P>
<P>
   I'm trying to put myself in the shoes (shoe?) of the surviving
Siamese twin here. Life has dealt you a really bad hand. You and
your brother or sister have just undergone an extremely dangerous
operation and you were the only one to come out alive. Maybe, just
maybe, you're not thinking real clearly at this point. You're
looking for someone to blame and your parents seem a likely
candidate. It all their fault! Well, Momsie and Popsie, let's just
see how you like it! You get out a needle and thread and ... well,
what follows is just too gruesome to write about in a family
newspaper.

   NEW YORK _ The theater company Voice and Vision, now in its
eighth year, is committed to developing works by and about women
and girls. The strength of this commitment is clear from the latest
theater work the company has commissioned, ``Jocasta,'' which uses
opera, dance and the spoken word to tell the story of Oedipus from
the imagined perspective of Jocasta.

   This is an all-female creation: the text is an English-language
version of a French libretto by Helene Cixous, the music is by the
Hamburg-born American composer Ruth Schonthal, the director is
Marya Mazor, the conductor is Teresa P. Cheung, the choreographer
is Christine Sang and the sets, costumes and lighting were designed
by women.
</P>
<P>
   The feminist spin on this seminal Sophocles tragedy was the
work's most intriguing element on Tuesday night at the Cornelia
Connelly Center for Education on East 8th St. in Manhattan, where
Voice and Vision presents its work. Jocasta is presented as a woman
deeply scarred by having been abandoned, as she sees it, by her
father when he went off to die. So later, as the wife of Oedipus,
she is fearful of abandonment by him. When Oedipus learns that he
is in fact Jocasta's son, she claims to have known it all along.
Refusing to be bound by convention, including the ``names'' of
mother and wife, she entreats him to defy the taboo and remain with
her, and charges that he, too, on some primal level, was attracted
by her resemblance to him.
</P>
<P>
   The libretto is long, philosophical and poetically stylized.
Setting it all to music would have made the work as long as
``Parsifal,'' hence Ms. Schonthal's decision to employ almost equal
portions of spoken and sung text. Jocasta is triply portrayed by an
actress (Mary Magdalena Hernandez), a soprano (Wilma Wever) and a
dancer (Dawn Akemi Saito); Oedipus is similarly portrayed by both
an actor (Russell Hornsby) and a baritone (Thomas Meglioranza).
</P>
<P>
   But mixing large spans of spoken dialogue into opera is never
easy. Language is direct and specific and can be overpowering. It
was especially so in this production because the actors' voices
were heavily amplified through body microphones. To match them, the
singers, chorus and pianist (Max Midroit) also had to rely on
amplification (microphones placed about the stage), which nullified
the intimacy of this wonderful 110-year-old, 200-seat theater.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schonthal, who fled Nazi Germany, studied with Hindemith at
Yale, and her style has some of the thickly chromatic
Neo-Classicism of her teacher. Her musical language is essentially
tonal, though spiked with dissonance. And though not especially
innovative, her work has an authentic voice. She also uses pastiche
effectively, as in some swaths of Romanticism that sounded like
disoriented Rachmaninoff. But the constant switching from sung to
spoken lines gets tiring and prevents the drama from having an
inexorable flow.
</P>
<P>
   The production is appropriately stark, and the gifted young cast
is attractive and engaging. Yet in striving to be weighty and
gripping, ``Jocasta'' gets draggy and ponderous.
</P>
<P>
   The final two performances are Thursday night and Saturday. &QL;

MATHEMATICS TO MADNESS, AND BACK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: W.Va., Calif.)   (af)  
 David Goodstein is a professor at the California Institute of
Technology. His latest book, written with his wife, Judith
Goodstein, is ``Feynman's Lost Lecture.''  
 By DAVID GOODSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Mathematics is a young man's game,'' the mathematician Norbert
Wiener wrote, ``yet it is not bearable to contemplate a brief
distinction and burgeoning of activity ... followed by a lifetime
of boredom.''
</P>
<P>
   John Forbes Nash Jr., a mathematician who had a genius for
solving hard problems in his own distinctive way, found an unusual
solution for this one, too. After the dazzling achievements of his
youth, he simply departed from the realm of consensual reality.
</P>
<P>
   He lived in a superheated world of schizophrenic delusions for
the better part of 30 years. Then he emerged, at least as sane as
the average mathematician, just in time to accept, graciously, the
1994 Nobel Prize in Economics.
</P>
<P>
   The story brings to mind the pianist David Helfgott and the
movie ``Shine.'' Sylvia Nasar, an economics correspondent for The
New York Times, has written a biography of Nash that reads like a
fine novel.
</P>
<P>
   Reared in blue-collar Bluefield, W.Va., Nash won a Westinghouse
scholarship that brought him to Carnegie Tech, where his
mathematical ability paved the way to graduate school at Princeton.
</P>
<P>
   In 1948, Fine Hall at Princeton was for mathematicians what
Paris had once been for painters and novelists; the air was so
thick with mathematical ideas that, in the words of Einstein's
assistant Leopold Infeld, if you put out your hand, you would find
``a few formulae are stuck to your palm.''
</P>
<P>
   The Protestant Nash, out of place in this largely Jewish setting
but not lacking in mathematical talent, wound up graduating on the
basis of a slender, 27-page doctoral thesis on the theory of
competitive games. It would eventually win him that Nobel Prize,
but it was not good enough to get him the position he coveted at
Princeton or Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   He landed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which in
spite of the presence of a few giants like Wiener, was a distinct
step down in Nash's mind.
</P>
<P>
   Now in his 20s, he proceeded to knock off a number of impressive
theorems, working in an intuitive style in which he saw the result
before he could provide the detailed steps. While an MIT colleague
named Warren Ambrose wrote a meticulous proof on the blackboard,
Nash could be heard muttering ``hack, hack'' from the back of the
room. Perhaps out of revenge, Ambrose asked Nash, ``Is it possible
to embed any Riemannian manifold in a Euclidian space?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nasar never really explains what that means, but it doesn't
matter. Having satisfied himself that it was a problem worthy of
his talents, Nash went after it with relentless tenacity, producing
at the end of two years what a Princeton mathematician called ``one
of the most important pieces of mathematical analysis in this
century.'' Mathematicians consider the Nobel-winning work trivial
by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   During this same period, Nash had two homosexual relationships
that left deep emotional traces; managed to get arrested in a sting
operation by the police in Santa Monica, Calif., which cost him his
summer consulting job at the Rand Corp.; took a mistress whom he
treated with casual, selfish cruelty, a practical nurse named
Eleanor Stier, who bore him a son named John; and finally married a
beautiful, aristocratic Salvadoran named Alicia Larde, a rare
female physics major at MIT.
</P>
<P>
   By the age of 30, he narrowly missed the Fields Medal, the
highest honor in mathematics, but he was awarded tenure at MIT, and
he had begun his inexorable descent into madness. He had, with
Alicia, another son, also named John, who later turned out to be
both a formidable mathematician and a paranoid schizophrenic.
</P>
<P>
   Nash resigned his tenured position almost as soon as he'd gotten
it, tried to give up his American citizenship, managed to get
himself expelled from both Switzerland and France, and suffered a
series of involuntary hospitalizations that put him at the mercy of
psychiatric crudities like insulin shock therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Nash was tall, handsome, muscular and witty when he courted
Alicia in the mid-50s. By the summer of 1960, ``he would go into
restaurants with bare feet,'' Ms. Nasar writes. ``With dark hair to
his shoulders and a bushy black beard, he had a fixed expression, a
dead gaze. Women, especially, found him frightening.''
</P>
<P>
   During a remission in the 1960s, he managed to write a couple of
quite good scientific papers, but the relief was only temporary.
</P>
<P>
   Although he and Alicia were divorced in 1963, she took him back
as a boarder in 1970, because no one else would. Given the stable
domestic arrangement provided by the hard-working Alicia, he became
the gentle ghost of Fine Hall, harmlessly haunting the library and
computer room and very gradually drifting back in the general
direction of sanity. Nash learned, he says, to discard the paranoid
thoughts the way a dieter stays off sweets.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Naser has managed to tease out the super-secret story of the
deliberations at the Swedish Academy that led to Nash's Nobel
Prize. This set piece alone will be a feast for Nobel junkies, full
of drama, politics and snobbery. The controversy was so bitter, it
almost put an end to the economics prize.
</P>
<P>
   She has a special knack for recreating the atmosphere of places
like Fine Hall, and for thumbnail sketches of the characters who
march through these pages, including many giants of 20th-century
mathematics. If you don't know what a Nash equilibrium is, you
won't understand it after reading this book, but that hardly
detracts from the pleasure it gives.
</P>
<P>
   There are numerous loose ends. (Alicia at one point is pregnant
with a second child who is never mentioned again.) But in a messy
life like Nash's, there are bound to be loose ends.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the book he no longer has to wonder whether he
will be permitted to enter the Princeton Faculty Club. The rest of
us feel as if we've been sitting there all along, happily gossiping
about him. &QL;

`INNOCENTS LOST': TRACKING CHILD ABUSE ABROAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Broadcast notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
(mk) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the 50th anniversary of the U.N. Convention of the Rights of
the Child, the lot of many of the world's children is far from
happy. That is the message of Kate Blewett and Brian Woods, who
traveled 70,000 miles and visited 21 countries to track down abuses
of the young in Russia and Ghana, Greece and Togo, Central America
and the United Arab Emirates. ``Innocents Lost'' is a harsh sequel
to their 1996 investigation, ``The Dying Rooms,'' which exposed the
mistreatment of baby girls in Chinese orphanages.
</P>
<P>
   Painful pictures and interviews make their case. The program
opens with scenes of camel races in the United Arab Emirates,
where, we are told, boys as young as 3 are the jockeys. It looks
like a dangerous sport, and the diminutive riders tell of falling a
lot. Signed up in Bangladesh in exchange for a few dollars to their
parents (``The smaller the child, the better,'' a trainer says),
the boys are kept until they outgrow their use and then are either
shipped back home or left to fend for themselves, unskilled
strangers in a foreign land.
</P>
<P>
   In a penal colony in the Urals and in a mental institution in
Greece, the filmmakers find children languishing without education
or treatment. In Ghana, young girls become slaves of resident
priests: ``I'm here forever,'' one says. In Costa Rica, North
American tourists tell of the Yankee dollar buying the sexual
favors of girls as young as 12 and 13; in Honduras, street children
comfort themselves by sniffing glue; in Guatemala, police squads
are implicated in beating, raping and killing homeless teen-agers.
Not all these conditions come as revelations, but everywhere a
sensitive camera captures the loneliness of defenseless children.
</P>
<P>
   Moved by sympathy and indignation, the filmmakers slip now and
then from reporting to exhorting; at moments they seem bent on
exhibiting their own concern by way of contrast with the world's
indifference. That may be understandable, but it also invites
mistrust of their judgment when, for example, they suggest that the
plight of homeless boys in New York and London is equivalent to the
horrors they have just reported from Central America.
</P>
<P>
   More revealing than their remonstrances is their recognition of
the causes at work: The poverty that induces desperate parents in
Togo to sell their children into servitude; the political pressure
in Russia to crack down on crime with little attention to educating
the young criminals; the stigma that attaches to the retarded in
Greece, and the religious beliefs that sustain the exploitation of
young girls in Ghana.
</P>
<P>
   These differing situations call for separate analysis. But even
if in their zeal Ms. Blewett and Woods go global and turn from
reporting to inveighing, much credit is still due for their
exertions, their dedication and their insistence that attention be
paid.

   Miss Jag
</P>
<P>
   Also known as: Jennifer Tanguy.
</P>
<P>
   Style: Darkstep and techstep, ``movable'' jungle.
</P>
<P>
   Dating advice: ``Sometimes guys say it turns them on (that a
woman can spin records) _ I just blow them off.''
</P>
<P>
   Mix tape? Soon. Check Swell Clothing and Records, 1444 N.
Scottsdale Road, Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   Genesis of a deejay: ``After I saw Emile, Gary (Menichello) and
Bahamut at Bassics (in November '96), I knew that I wanted to be up
there and do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Best trainspotter: ``My mom came to my debut at Planet Rampant
(in November '97). She said it was `interesting.' '' &QL; 
Lady Jane
</P>
<P>
   Also known as: Erin Gwinn.
</P>
<P>
   Style: Techstep jungle, ``darker, musical stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Mix tape? Yes, but supply is spotty. Check Swell, Plastik
Records (101 S. Central Ave., Phoenix) or Burn Music (7607 E.
McDowell Road, Scottsdale).
</P>
<P>
   Gut reaction to deejaying: ``I play oboe in an orchestra (at the
University of Arizona), so the thought of all the freedom I have
deejaying was almost scary at first.''
</P>
<P>
   Academic goal: To put on a party for her senior thesis where a
deejay and a chamber orchestra play together. ``I'd have to find
some really good musicians, though. The beats on the record don't
change, and they'd have to keep together.''
</P>
<P>
   Parting thoughts on gender: ``I've always been a tomboy, so
maybe that makes me more open to being in a male-dominated
situation like deejaying.''
</P>
<P>
   Current whereabouts: Unknown. Gwinn fled Tucson for the wilds of
Los Angeles this summer. Reports are that she'll be back for the
fall semester at the UA.
</P>
<P>
   Mara
</P>
<P>
   Also known as: Mara Arrieta.
</P>
<P>
   Style: Electro, house and breakbeat. ``I like to mix it up a lot
and play different styles. It's important to show you can play
everything, and it keeps them guessing.''
</P>
<P>
   Mix tape? No. ``I find them really limiting. What if somebody
hears your tape from a couple years ago and thinks you're bad
because the music's not so fresh? If you want to hire me, I'll tell
you where to come see me, and I'll do a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Trainspotters, beware: ``I'd rather play for three people
dancing than 3,000 people standing there watching me. What kind of
vibe is that? I hate it when people watch me.'' &QL;

   (Undated) - (begin ital) With a banana seat and long, shiny
chrome handlebars, the Schwinn Krate bikes made children of the
early '70s feel like they could outrun the wind. The company hopes
they'll feel the same as adults.
</P>
<P>
   Schwinn Cycling and Fitness Inc. is putting the popular Orange
Krate and Apple Krate bikes back into limited production, targeting
buyers from their 20s to their mid-40s. . . . Introduced in 1968,
the Orange Krate was the first true ``off-road'' bicycle, featuring
full suspension and advanced technology, such as rear shocks. It
retailed for $86.95. . . . Gregg Bagni, Schwinn marketing vice
president, said the new Orange and Apple Krate bicycles will cost
about $459. ``The '70s retro thing is still on fire,'' he said.

<P>
   With its simple design and ease of care, the Pet Rock made
children of the '70s feel like they, too, could buy into a
pointless craze. The Clueless Quarry Co. hopes they'll feel the
same as adults.
</P>
<P>
   The company is putting the popular Pet Rock back into limited
production, targeting buyers with low intelligence. A Clueless
spokesman said he hoped the reintroduction would help lift the
company out of recent financial doldrums, ``since we can just sell
some of this extra rock we have lying around.''
</P>
<P>
   The original retailed for $3.95. The spokesman said the new Pet
Rock will cost about $95, ``which is still cheaper than a pure-bred
puppy.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _With a popularity so great it spawned hit songs, popular
television shows and even feature films, citizens band radios made
adults of the '70s feel like they were ``putting the hammer down''
in the demanding truck-driving industry. Self-Important hopes they
still feel the same.
</P>
<P>
   Self-Important is putting the radios, rendered obsolete as a
popular trend by cellular phones, back into limited production,
targeting buyers who still purchase Beta recorders. ``The time is
right for people to go back to `handles,' '' a Self-Important
spokesman said. ``We believe the person willing to wear
bell-bottoms to a restaurant is also willing to be called `Rump
Shaker' over public airwaves.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Prices for the original radios varied. The spokesman said the
new CB radios will go for $750, with leasing plans available.
``Unless we can get C.W. McCall to write a rap version of
``Convoy.'' That might drive the price up.'' &QL; 
_With its cloying, maudlin lyrics and syrupy tune, ``Seasons in the
Sun'' made music fans of the '70s feel like they were attending a
funeral. Pointless Records hopes kids today will feel the same way.
</P>
<P>
   The record company is reissuing a limited release of the single,
which spent three weeks at No. 1 in 1974, targeting the same fans
of limited taste who made Celine Dion's song ``My Heart Will Go
On,'' from the ``Titanic'' soundtrack, such a hit. ``There is no
underestimating the taste of the American public,'' a Pointless
spokesman said. ``I mean, just listen to `classic rock' radio. Who
can argue realistically that ``Nights in White Satin'' is any
better a song than this?''
</P>
<P>
   The original single, sung by Terry Jacks, retailed for less than
$1. The enhanced CD, which includes a CD-ROM multimedia history of
the recording of the song, will cost $48. ``This includes an
air-sick bag, in case people don't really remember the song,'' the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   _With its pointless humor, bad acting and ridiculous story
lines, ``Welcome Back, Kotter'' made '70s television fans feel like
they were honorary ``sweathogs.'' Unnecessary Pictures hopes
they'll feel the same as adults.
</P>
<P>
   The production company is making a big-screen version of the
popular sitcom, targeting the same mental giants who tune in to
``Suddenly Susan'' and ``Veronica's Closet.'' The show, which
rocketed John Travolta to fame, ``speaks to today's poor student,''
an Unnecessary spokesman said. ``We hope we can reach the same kids
who are inspired by Bart Simpson to do poorly in school, only on an
even larger scale.''
</P>
<P>
   The television show, of course, was free. The movie tickets will
cost $7.50 each, the spokesman said, ``unless we can convince
people to pay more.'' &QL;

NEW YORK RECOMMENDS MORE READING FOR STUDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RICK KARLIN  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ If students are going to meet New York's higher
academic standards, they need to start reading 25 books a year and
write 1,000 words each month, top state educators say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big leap, and you can see it in the (bookless)
backpacks of students,'' Education Commissioner Richard Mills said
Tuesday. ``Ask students how much they read and it's not close to
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mills and Carl Hayden, chancellor of the state Board of Regents,
announced new English curriculum guidelines, including a list of
dozens of suggested books, poems, plays and periodicals that
students from prekindergarten through 12th grade should be reading.
</P>
<P>
   ``This also sends a powerful message to parents,'' Hayden said,
explaining that adults must ``wean'' their kids off television,
video games and other distractions, if the youngsters are to find
the time for 25 books a year.
</P>
<P>
   Some students, though, said the new guidelines were too
ambitious. ``That's too many,'' Albany High School ninth-grader
Nieishia Lloyd said. She figures she reads about a half-dozen books
a year for English class, with the most recent being ``Romeo and
Juliet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten is more realistic,'' added sophomore Latasha White, who
just polished off Stephen King's ``Misery'' in her English class.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, I don't really like to read,'' said Marybeth Henry,
a junior. Henry, who just finished ``Macbeth,'' reads about a
half-dozen books a year and peruses magazines like Readers Digest.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines are not mandatory, but state officials said that,
if followed, the reading and writing will help students pass the
new Regents requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines, which are outlined in workbooks and CD-ROMs
being sent to all the state's schools, also are intended to satisfy
critics, including teachers, who in the past have said they need
guidance on how to help students reach the upgraded standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted more details and we've responded to that,'' Hayden
said. ``It's part of our continuing promise to you and to the
public to make the standards clear.''
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Regents, which sets state education policy, has
embarked on an ambitious plan to have all high school students pass
a sequence of college-prep level Regents exams in order to earn a
high school diploma. This plan, which replaces the easier
non-Regents tests that more than half the state's students now
take, is being phased in over several years.
</P>
<P>
   English will be the first Regents test students will have to
take. This year's 10th-graders are all required to pass the test in
order to graduate.
</P>
<P>
   Mills described the reading list as ``a series of very, very
strong suggestions'' for schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most common question in the classroom is: `What's going to
be on the test?''' Mills said. ``This is going to be on the test.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials emphasized students won't have to answer factual
questions about the books on the list, such as names and dates. But
students will perform better on essay questions if they have read
from the list.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the list, derived largely from a survey of English and
reading teachers, consists of classics that would be recognizable
to the baby boom generation.
</P>
<P>
   The list seemed to avoid any controversial books, though it
contains J.D. Salinger's ``Catcher in the Rye,'' which has been
criticized by fundamentalist Christians as being too racy, and Mark
Twain's ``The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,'' which has come
under fire for use of a racial slur to describe blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``These books are books that teachers teach today; they've been
teaching them for years,'' state Education Department spokesman
Bill Hirschen said. The guidelines also call for lots of practice
for students to hone their writing skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no secrets or shortcuts,'' Roseanne DeFabio,
coordinator of curriculum and instruction, said of how writing
should be taught. ``It's repetition. Over and over again.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's largest teachers union welcomed the guidelines. ``It
sounds as if the commissioner is adding to the new standards
something we've been asking him to do for a long time,'' said Linda
Rosenblatt, spokeswoman for the New York State United Teachers.

 &HT;    Yoakam again proves he's off-center but right on target
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the 15-plus years since Dwight Yoakam emerged from the
honky-tonk Los Angeles club scene, a question has dogged his
career: Is he making country music, or is he pretending to make
country music? Certainly the lanky star was a product of cloning in
the early days, lifting heavily from Buck Owens' Brylcreem-era
tunes in search of his own style. These two albums _ one from the
man himself and the other a collection of others covering his work
_ show that Yoakam has evolved into much more than pouty pantomime.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, he still pulls styles out of his cowboy hat like a master
mimic. The Owens-influenced tune ``The Curse'' has Yoakam
stretching the accent (``These are the thangs I wish fer you'')
with whiny backing vocals straight out of the Bonnie Owens
songbook. ``Things Change'' is built over a dramatic guitar riff
lifted from the Animals' ``It's My Life.'' And this time he dips
into circa-1965 Nashville-sound strings on ``Yet to Succeed'' and
``I'll Just Take These,'' which both sound a lot like Jack Greene's
``Statue of a Fool.'' But what a combination of flair and
experimentation. Though never quite accepted by the Nashville
establishment, Yoakam's albums are like lightning bolts over
today's predictable country landscape, making your hair stand on
end with their energy.
</P>
<P>
   The album of cover tunes, ``Will Sing for Food'' (a benefit for
the homeless), proves that he's not entirely a product of slick
production. In the hands of other artists, such as sweet Sara
Evans, sassy Kim Richey or the haunting Gillian Welch, Yoakam
classics such as ``The Distance Between You and Me'' and ``Miner's
Prayer'' show that his songs can stand alone long after his tight
pants get thrown over a chair. A gospel piano and dobro version of
``I Sang Dixie,'' by bluegrass songbird Rhonda Vincent, confirms
that this tune may be one of the best wallow-in-it country
tear-jerkers ever written.
</P>
<P>
   These two CDs prove it: Like the cousin who left home and went
to college up North, Yoakam's a little different from mainstream
Nashville, but he's still the real deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Long Way Home''
</P>
<P>
   Dwight Yoakam. Reprise. 13 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   ``Will Sing for Food:
</P>
<P>
   The Songs of Dwight Yoakam''
</P>
<P>
   Various artists. Little Dog. 14 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A killer double dose of Dwight.

 &HT;    Center at Duke University documents people behind the problems
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JUNE 14: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Bo Emerson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Durham, N.C. _ The teenagers hanging out on Franklin Street have
that scary look. Pierced noses. Strange haircuts. Grungy clothes.
They're panhandling pedestrians and smoking cigarettes and
otherwise acting like a bunch of punks. ``Nobody's happy here,''
says regular scene-maker Jessica Turner, 16.
</P>
<P>
   But Claire Trask sees something different. The Duke University
senior has been photographing these Chapel Hill kids for eight
months. She's had them over to her house, fielded distraught phone
calls from their parents, visited their crash pads. She has spied
the little children hiding behind the tattoos.
</P>
<P>
   And you can see it in the photo essay she has assembled for a
class with the Center for Documentary Studies. Of choosing music
for her slide show, she says, ``I could have put it with the
Beastie Boys, and people would have said, `These kids are going to
pot.' But I didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Trask, 22, chose Nat King Cole, singing ``L-O-V-E,''
and the street scene became a love story.
</P>
<P>
   ``The veil dropped,'' says Alex Harris, co-founder of the
center. ``You carry in your mind a picture of what you're going to
do. How do you get rid of those pictures and really react to what's
in front of you? It takes time; it takes forming a relationship
with
</P>
<P>
   people.''
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1988 with support from the Lyndhurst Foundation, the
center has been training future Walker Evanses in its classes for
undergraduates, while pursuing a titanic research project on the
lives of black Southerners during the Jim Crow years.
</P>
<P>
   That project, called ``Behind the Veil,'' draws on 1,800 hours
of interviews in 25 communities and 10 states, completed over eight
years with the help of 50 graduate students from several North
Carolina schools. From it will flow several books and a special
archive of material at the John Hope Franklin Research Center,
which should support doctoral research for years to come, said
project leader William Chafe.
</P>
<P>
   Connected with the Veil undertaking is a service program called
Community Stories, through which summer interns train young people
in inner-city neighborhoods to also become documentarians, to take
oral histories from elders in the community. ``We want to teach
kids to be better thinkers,'' says coordinator Delia Gamble. Adds
Harris, ``They find it helps strengthen community identity,
strengthens bonds between young and old.''
</P>
<P>
   The center is also a publishing house. In addition to DoubleTake
magazine, it has produced a dozen high-quality books that
concentrate on the kind of personalized social inquiry favored by
co-founder Robert Coles. Recent titles include the 1998 book
``Closing: The Life and Death of American Factory'' _ the story, in
words and pictures, of the death of a Mebane, N.C., furniture
factory _ and ``The Youngest Parents,'' a 1997 Coles book about
teenagers with children of their own.
</P>
<P>
   The first in what is to be a series of yearly documentary film
festivals, sponsored by the center in May, attracted such noted
filmmakers as Ken Burns and Albert Maysles.
</P>
<P>
   This interlocking web of activities operates out of a homey
19th-century country manor just off the Duke campus, with rocking
chairs on the porch and _ small wonder _ gorgeous photographs on
every wall.
</P>
<P>
   Just inside the door and down the uneven boards of the front
hall are ghostly black-and-white images from the hills of Chiapas,
Mexico. In a new $1.5 million wing connected to the house are
classrooms, lecture halls and an impromptu gallery of
self-portraits from patients at a mental health facility.
</P>
<P>
   DoubleTake magazine is the center's best-known product. The
spring issue's interview with rocker Bruce Springsteen, by Will
Percy, had an unusual genesis. Percy's uncle, the late novelist
Walker Percy, had a lasting influence on Coles with his 1961 novel
``The Moviegoer.'' (Coles even uses the protagonist's name as his
e-mail moniker.) It turns out that Walker Percy was also a fan of
Springsteen's. The elder Percy wrote to Springsteen in 1989 and,
though the musician didn't respond at the time, he began reading
the novelist's work, eventually corresponding with Percy's widow.
(Percy died in 1990.) In the interview, Springsteen talks about
populism, folk culture and how books, including Percy's work, have
affected his music.
</P>
<P>
   Often the outreach, teaching and publishing arms of the center
work in synergy. Wendy Ewald, a MacArthur Prize-winning
photographer based in New York, offers a course sponsored by the
center called ``Literacy Through Photography,'' which gives cameras
to Durham school kids and then prompts them to write about their
images. Ewald's work has also been featured in several issues of
the magazine, including a haunting series of images that resulted
when she asked youngsters to take photographs of their dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Name another magazine that would publish that,'' says Esquire
magazine senior editor and former DoubleTake staffer Jay Woodruff.
``They're almost the conscience of the culture out there, doing
God's work.''

 &HT;    The healing art of stories
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JUNE 14: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Bo Emerson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert M. Coles strides across the Emory University(Ga.) campus,
on his way to give a lecture at the venerable Glenn Memorial United
Methodist Church, when his steps bring him to a steep gully, cut by
a swift, murky creek.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's swim it,'' he says, with an impish grin. ``I'd love to
arrive dirty and disheveled.''
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't be the first time that the Harvard University(Mass.)
professor, a recipient of this year's Presidential Medal of
Freedom, has departed from the beaten path.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, he was headed toward a low-key life as a child
psychiatrist when Coles encountered a white mob trying to scare the
life out of a little black girl named Ruby Bridges. The civil
rights movement loomed in front of him. He jumped in.
</P>
<P>
   As he followed Ruby and other students who were integrating
Southern schools in the 1960s, he abandoned his career and found
his life's work. His stated plan was to study how children handled
the stress of integration. His real focus, however, became the
psyche of the country, as America went through what his mentor Erik
Erikson would call an identity crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children of Crisis,'' the monumental series of books that
sprang from Coles' experiences in the South, won the Pulitzer Prize
in 1973 and anointed Coles America's counselor at large.
</P>
<P>
   Through his writings on the moral, spiritual and political lives
of children, and his books about migrant workers, Eskimos, Indians,
teen parents, the elderly and many other subjects (more than 60
books at last count), Coles became the conscience of a generation
and one of the most significant social historians since James Agee,
author of ``Let Us Now Praise Famous Men.'' Catholic priest and
writer Andrew Greeley has called him a ``secular saint'' _
terminology that makes Coles distinctly ill at ease.
</P>
<P>
   This is a confirmed Yankee, with a honking Boston accent to
prove it. (In Coles' mouth, ``Harvard'' rhymes with ``avid.'') But
he never left the South completely behind. For 20 years, he has
taught part time at Duke University(N.C.), and in 1988 he
co-founded Duke's Center for Documentary Studies, with Atlanta
photographer Alex Harris and William Chafe, now Duke's dean of arts
and sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Among the publications created by the center is the visually
stunning magazine DoubleTake, a large-format quarterly collection
of photography, reportage, fiction and poetry that is Coles and
Harris' special brainchild. Established in 1995, it has won raves,
including a National Magazine Award for general excellence this
year for featuring work such as the photographs of Helen Levitt,
the poetry of Seamus Heaney, and writing by John McPhee and Joyce
Carol Oates.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine's 60,000 readers _ roughly the same kind of folks
who tune in to National Public Radio _ expect an earthy mixture of
the well-known and the obscure. Early issues balanced a newly
discovered short story by Flannery O'Connor with a remarkable essay
and drawings by a 7-year-old named Kristin Graves, who explained in
heartbreaking language the story of her mother's death in an
automobile accident.
</P>
<P>
   DoubleTake, says Coles, is an extension of his Duke classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an old teacher; I've got a new classroom,'' he says. ``How
many can come to a lecture, 400 or 500? And DoubleTake reaches
60,000. It's a wonderful educational opportunity. I used to write
for The New Yorker under William Shawn, and he said, `I regard
myself as a teacher, principally.'''
</P>
<P>
   He teaches documentary work not by handing his students a tape
recorder, but by shoving them into a new world. It could be a
public housing project, or a migrant labor camp or a mountain
shack, but it's probably someplace where undergrads paying $25,000
a year in tuition rarely go. He shows them how to get lost in
someone else's story.
</P>
<P>
   Coming South
</P>
<P>
   It happened to Coles. The tale is one he repeats for all of his
classes, at Duke and Harvard, and he tells it again to a group of
faculty and graduate students during this same Emory visit in May.
</P>
<P>
   Disheveled, if not dirty, Coles, 68, radiates a Peter Falkian
charm as he paces before the audience assembled in the Emory
student center: His shirt sleeves are rolled up to reveal hairy,
muscular forearms, his face bristling with permanent 5 o'clock
shadow. He seems to have combed his unpredictable salt-and-pepper
mane with a Mixmaster.
</P>
<P>
   The voice is as cranky as a New England winter, softened by a
set of flannel vocal chords. The jacket and tie are missing. (His
children forced this self-described slob to buy a new suit in
January so he would look presentable at the White House while
receiving the Medal of Freedom from President Clinton.)
</P>
<P>
   He tells the group about being drafted as a young psychiatrist
and stationed at Keesler Air Force Base in Biloxi, Miss., when he
first realized that there was a revolution going on under his nose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd been in the Force for a year, and I had paid no attention
to any of this stuff, even though I was a reasonably well-educated
person from all these snotty schools up North,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Then one Sunday afternoon in 1960, Coles rode his bicycle home
along U.S. 90 in Biloxi, where he saw whites attacking blacks who'd
trespassed on ``their'' beach. The incident riveted him, as did the
experience during a visit to New Orleans, when he saw the
6-year-old Ruby Bridges kneel in the midst of a mob and pray for
her attackers.
</P>
<P>
   He couldn't get these moments out of his mind, and he was
desperate to do something about them. ``Something was happening to
me, some kind of moral crisis, not to mention personal crisis, as I
was trying to figure out what to do with my life,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The moments became a touchstone for him. The moral courage of
the little girl in the starched white dress was a central image of
``Children of Crisis,'' and an image that Coles returns to
frequently in his writings. He spun the tale again in 1995 with a
popular children's book, ``The Story of Ruby Bridges,'' the
proceeds of which benefit the Ruby Bridges Education Foundation.
(Disney made it into a TV special this year.) As Ruby changed his
life, so did his attention change hers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have kids all over the country that see me as this great
role model,'' says Ruby Bridges Hall, now a mother of four in New
Orleans. ``It humbles me.''
</P>
<P>
   An active observer
</P>
<P>
   Coles also studied the children who integrated Atlanta schools
in the early '60s, while he lived in the Vinings area and attended
All Saints Episcopal Church in Midtown. He says that he learned
much from Atlanta news-papermen Gene Patterson and Ralph McGill.
``Never mind all this social science crap,'' he says, with typical
bluntness. ``They taught me how to go talk to people and interview
them in their homes, where they lived.''
</P>
<P>
   Far from acting the detached observer during those years, Coles
put his own life on the line. In the summer of 1964 he and his wife
Jane Hallowell Coles were staying at a safe house in McComb, Miss.,
when a bomb destroyed the structure. ``Then the police came and
arrested us all, like we were the ones who dynamited our own
house,'' says a laughing Coles. He and his wife were shaken but
unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   And if he hadn't been drafted and sent to Biloxi? ``If that
hadn't happened to me, I'd have an office somewhere on Brattle
Street,'' he says. Then adds, with a curl of the lip, ``I'd be
treating gifted, troubled, Harvard students.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But Coles didn't seem destined for the conventional
career arc. He remembers when his mother, Sandra, a hard-headed
descendant of Yankee abolitionists, took him out of elementary
school one day to see her hero Franklin D. Roosevelt as he
motorcaded through Boston. Little Bobby's teacher objected, but
Sandra was firm. ``He'll remember this long after he forgets
everything he learned in school,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of Boston Latin, Coles studied literature at Harvard,
writing his thesis on the doctor/poet William Carlos Williams.
Coles sent him a copy and Williams was impressed (``Not bad, for a
Harvard student,'' he wrote), and suggested Coles try medicine:
``Lots to keep you busy, and lots to make you think.''
</P>
<P>
   But Coles was a mediocre medical student; he was ready to quit
when his mother chided him for his selfish ennui. ``Why don't you
go work in a soup kitchen?'' she asked. ``That will be one way for
you to see what a lucky life you've had.''
</P>
<P>
   He did, working two summers during the early 1950s at a shelter
operated by Catholic activist Dorothy Day. She inspired Coles to
write her biography (``Dorothy Day: A Radical Devotion'') and
showed him the kind of life that he would strive toward, a life
consumed with service.
</P>
<P>
   Coles completed the training to become a pediatrician, but
changed to psychiatry. Like his mentor, Williams, Coles became
better known for his writing than his work in medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Real stories
</P>
<P>
   Back in Boston, Coles is sometimes referred to as Robert ``Never
an Unpublished Thought'' Coles. Certainly his literary output, all
written in ballpoint pen on yellow legal pads, is prodigious.
</P>
<P>
   His writing, Coles freely admits, is a device to keep him out of
faculty meetings, which he abhors. Though he is perched at the top
of the university heap, Coles has a thinly veiled contempt for the
stuffy world of the academy. (Just ask him about intellectuals: ``I
hate the word! I hate the people!'' Or about Ivy-league professors:
``Stuck-up big shots.'')
</P>
<P>
   He especially holds suspect the rhetoric of social science.
``Such abstractions as `ghetto neighborhood' or `culturally
deprived child' or `socially marginal this' and `something else
that,' I'm trying to rescue myself and the people I write about
from these overwrought and sometimes fatuous generalizations,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   His role models are Dickens, Tolstoy and Steinbeck,
documentarians who portrayed their societies in a wealth of
complex, contradictory detail. ``I favor their leadership rather
than the leadership that populates our universities in the name of
social science,'' he says. ``Novelists and short story writers,
they do it out of their imagination. The only difference is, I do
it in connection with the concreteness of real people.''
</P>
<P>
   Coles, the James Agee Professor of Social Ethics at Harvard,
draws on these novelists in his popular Harvard course, ``A
Literature of Social Reflection,'' which students jokingly call
``Guilt 105,'' because of its emphasis on ethics and morality.
Undergrads hell-bent on careers in law and business are treated to
the counter-cultural writings of George Orwell, Ralph Ellison,
Flannery O'Connor and others, and some find their goals changing.
</P>
<P>
   Former student Tom Kelley, now a director of community programs
at the Center for Documentary Studies, says he took Coles' courses
as a Harvard undergrad. ``I was mystified by his approach. He gets
up and he just tells stories. What's the theme? How can I critique
this? That's not how aggressive young pre-med students are taught
to think.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At times I blame Bob Coles for my mediocre grade point
average,'' says Jay Woodruff, a former DoubleTake staffer and
currently an editor at Esquire magazine, who studied with Coles in
the early 1980s. ``I was very affected by his perspective on the
world. It gave me a convenient excuse to care a lot less about
things like midterms.''
</P>
<P>
   William Chafe, a historian and chronicler of the Civil Rights
movement, has observed Coles' ability to create believers, to move
young people toward idealism. ``I've known Bob for 15 years, says
Chafe. ``He is a charismatic figure. He inspires people, makes them
want to do exciting work, with a passion that's all-consuming.''
</P>
<P>
   A life of service
</P>
<P>
   The Center at Duke has given Coles access to a new group of
followers, in particular, the readers of DoubleTake, which he
started with Alex Harris.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of those genius people who needs to have a challenge
at every turn,'' says Isabel Geffner, DoubleTake's associate
publisher. ``That's a wonderful lesson in how to grow up, and grow
older: When you're in your 60s, by God, start a magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite winning awards and getting large infusions of cash
from various donors _ including a $10 million grant from the
Lyndhurst foundation _ DoubleTake is hemorrhaging about $2 million
a year. ``I think we've got a year or two,'' says Coles, whose
office is, aptly, decorated with wall-sized blowups of children's
drawings. ``If we pull it off, we'll continue. If we don't, it will
be a noble experiment.''
</P>
<P>
   When he's not in Durham, Coles directs the magazine from his
Harvard office (in FDR's old room at Adams House), running up a
heavy Federal Express bill as photos and proofs are shipped back
and forth. During the early hours he works on his next two books,
editing a collection of the writings of German theologian Dietrich
Bonhoeffer, and writing a book to be called ``Moral Leadership,''
about the character of such exemplars as Bonhoeffer and Bridges.
</P>
<P>
   That he lets his associates run the Center for Documentary
Studies when he's not around is in keeping with his laissez faire
organizational style. Harris remembers an early collaboration, when
Coles invited him to New Mexico and Alaska to shoot photographs for
what would become two books, ``The Old Ones of New Mexico'' (1973)
and ``The Last and First Eskimos'' (1978). ``I had just heard him
mesmerize a room, and I thought `This guy is going to show me the
way.' It turns out he was interested in what I was going to find
there,'' says Harris. ``Not what he was going to teach me.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Center still doesn't offer a degree or even a major,
it offers what Coles believes is a powerful tool, useful to
students in all disciplines.
</P>
<P>
   And that is, he says, ``first-hand awareness of how people live,
uncluttered by jargon, unmediated by high-falutin' theoretical
talk. They'll remember voices, they'll remember sights, they'll be
able to pull together portraits of individuals, be able to think in
reasonably clear language about fellow human beings, how they live,
what they want out of life.''
</P>
<P>
   They'll be able to hear the stories that are all around them.
It's Dr. Coles' prescription for a good life.

 &HT;    Curse all bad drivers and bless the good, male and female
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JUNE 14: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A friend brought up the old subject that I like boys better than
girls. She said she knew I was glad that our newest baby, Jack, is
a boy.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I'm glad Jack is Jack, but I would have liked a girl baby,
too. She said she knew I had always thought men drivers were better
than women drivers, and I said no such thing. I know some good ones
and some bad ones of both sexes.
</P>
<P>
   The golden-haired beauty who is bad to tailgate and will pull up
on your left side at an intersection, blocking the view of oncoming
traffic, is not my favorite _ but neither is her brother, if he
does the same. I understand, but do not like, the old lady who
scolds you by tapping her horn if she thinks you are slow to turn
right on red. I don't think her husband would do that, but then
he's never with her. Maybe he hates her, too.
</P>
<P>
   Just because I have said I find truck drivers the most courteous
drivers doesn't mean I like men truck drivers better than women. I
think truck drivers in general are taught courtesy. They will let
you change lanes in front of them, and they will stop if you have
trouble on the road and make a barrier of their truck to divert
traffic. I have even had a truck driver for one of the big lines
stop and shoo me and my children passengers back off the shoulder
and change a tire for me.
</P>
<P>
   My friend thought she had me trapped when I admitted that some
of my best friends are men. You don't work with men all your life
without developing affection and admiration for some of them. But
then, there are women very dear to me, too. It's a dumb question.
Men or women? We seem to need both.
</P>
<P>
   It gives me extra sympathy for the single-parent family. The
old-fashioned concept that a household needs a man has a lot to
commend it. I don't mean just economically. Nowadays, most women
have found ways to support their families.
</P>
<P>
   But what does a kid do when he has a splinter in his foot
calling for the blade of a little pocketknife? My mother would
wield a needle, but when I drove a big splinter from Seymour Creek
bridge into my bare heel, she couldn't find it. She simply held my
hands and made soothing noises while my father made a quick slit
with his little knife and the ugly splinter popped out. He taught
me to paddle a boat and to cast for bream in the millpond. He
showed me how to regulate the flow of water through the big dam so
I could scrub my body without drowning. He taught me how to change
the tire on the little Ford he bought me when I got a job in town.
I could even clean spark plugs then but probably not now.
</P>
<P>
   He tried to teach me to be quiet. When my mother raged about
anything, he was a tolerant listener. I may have missed that
talent, but I know it exists and is probably a special masculine
trait.
</P>
<P>
   When I was sick, I wanted my mother and did not particularly
want him sitting on the side of the bed taking my temperature. Muv
did not believe in thermometers. The palm of her hand was more
accurate, she felt.
</P>
<P>
   I was warmed and proud of his pride in military service, and I
believed implicitly in his religion. (My mother could change hers
to suit the occasion.)
</P>
<P>
   I only wish that the young boys in the family, even baby Jack,
could have benefited by his calmness, his patience, his masculine
know-how with machinery and guns and knives.
</P>
<P>
   Boy children or girl children? Give me both.

 &HT;    Slinky-style bracelets make a bold fashion statement when worn
by the bunch

   The more the merrier. That's the sentiment of women all over
town who are slipping into something cheap and slinky: the newly
popular guitar string bracelets that you buy _ and wear _ by the
bunch.
</P>
<P>
   At stores such as the Limited, these gold-and silver-toned
bracelets sell at $10 for a pack of 20. That's the going rate for
them as well at the Beth Ann Image and Accessory Boutique in
Buckhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more you put on, the stronger the statement they make,''
said the boutique's owner, Beth Ann Taratoot. ``The rage among
those customers of mine who can afford it is to buy 50 or more.''
</P>
<P>
   The guitar string bracelets _ alternately referred to as
``slinkies'' _ come in a thicker version that costs $1 each.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Limited and Beth Ann's, they're also sold at
Saks Fifth Avenue and Erika Reade Ltd..

 &HT;    Designer prides himself on pretty, pain-free shoes
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JUNE 14: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stuart Weitzman designs ``killer'' shoes that are actually quite
harmless.
</P>
<P>
   The New York designer, who counts Cindy Crawford and Tipper Gore
among his clients, puts foam padding in his stilettos, rubber soles
on his loafers and suede linings in his pumps. Another fan, Rosie
O'Donnell, wore his comfy black heels to last week's Tony Awards.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent appearance in Atlanta to showcase his $150-$200
shoes for fall, Weitzman said: ``My firm is known for making
pretty, comfortable shoes that fit. I would not risk my reputation
by making a fabulous-looking shoe that hurts.'' shoe that fits.''
</P>
<P>
   Bridal salon owner Elise Johnson of Greenville, S.C. can relate.
She and her daugher Susan were stocking up on10 pairs of heels and
flats during Weitzman's visit because, says Johnson `` when you're
on your feet all day, you simply have to wear comfy shoes.'' And
Stuart's are.''
</P>
<P>
   Between fittings with customers, the designer chatted with
Style:
</P>
<P>
   Q:Any innovations in the footwear business?
</P>
<P>
   A:High-tech materials. This fall, I'm designing with Gore-Tex
that's been a staple in outerwear for a number of years. It's a
man-made fabric that breathes and is waterproof, making it ideal
for footwear. Also I'm using suede that's been laminated with
Lycra. It stretches and fits like a glove.
</P>
<P>
   Q:How do you feel about being copied by other designers?
</P>
<P>
   A:On one hand, it's discouraging. On the other, it forces me to
be more creative. Also, if other shoe manufacturers don't copy my
designs, I'm not doing my job.
</P>
<P>
   Q:How many collections do you produce each season and where are
your shoes made?
</P>
<P>
   A:I design three lines a year for a total of 550 styles. I spend
half the year in Spain, where my shoes are made in my own
factories.
</P>
<P>
   Q:About how many shoes do you sell each year?
</P>
<P>
   A:I sell over 1 million pairs a year, in store boutiques and in
six free-standing stores. The Bob Ellis store in Phipps sells the
most Weitzman shoes _ 10,000 pairs a year.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Do you visit Atlanta often?
</P>
<P>
   A:Atlanta is my adopted home, since my wife's family, the
Gershons, live here.

 &HT;    Jeff Buckley release highlights our loss
 &HT;    By Shane Harrison
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   On May 29, 1997, Jeff Buckley drowned in Memphis, where he was
about to begin recording. Those sessions were to be his second pass
at a follow-up to 1994's ``Grace,'' his excellent full-length
debut.
</P>
<P>
   After recording some ``official studio demos'' with former
Television main man Tom Verlaine as producer, Buckley was to be
joined by ``Grace'' producer Andy Wallace to record an album he
planned to call ``My Sweetheart the Drunk.'' The demos have been
remixed here and, even in their incomplete state, are a sprawling
and ambitious step forward. Songs such as ``The Sky Is a Landfill''
and ``Nightmares by the Sea,'' with guitars that slash and burn,
sit side by side with the quiet beauty of ``Morning Theft'' and
``You &AMP; I.'' Buckley had a masterful way with dynamics and the
vocal brilliance to pull off most anything he put his mind to.
</P>
<P>
   The second of the two discs contains mostly solo four-track
demos that document the early stages of songs Buckley had been
working on in Memphis. He was an electrifying solo performer
onstage, and many of these low-fi tracks capture some of that
spark.
</P>
<P>
   The recording process can capture only so much, though, and it's
a tragedy that we'll never again hear Buckley's living, breathing
voice, dark, sweet and gooey as caramel. He could have made a
grocery list sound sensual. The set ends, as his memorial service
did, with a version of ``Satisfied Mind,'' which somehow gains
added poignance from the singer's clearing his throat between
verses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sketches for
</P>
<P>
   My Sweetheart
</P>
<P>
   the Drunk''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Buckley. Columbia. 20 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A moving and lovingly compiled musical epitaph.

 &HT;    POLITICAL BATTLE OVER CENSUS SAMPLING HAS A DATE IN COURT
 &HT;    Not for Atlanta
 &HT;    By MARK SHERMAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A political dispute masquerading as a legal issue
makes its first appearance in federal court Thursday as Republicans
try to prevent the Clinton administration from using statistical
methods in the 2000 census.
</P>
<P>
   A panel of three federal judges will decide whether the
Constitution requires a head count of every American, or if the
statistical method known as scientific sampling _ favored by the
administration and the National Academy of Sciences _ can be used
to round out the picture of the U.S. population.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau wants to use sampling because it does not
believe it can count every American, particularly minorities,
recent immigrants and transient populations. These groups were
prominent in the 8.4 million people the 1990 Census failed to
count, according to the bureau's estimates. In addition, another
4.4 million people were counted twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fundamental to our democracy is the principle of one person,
one vote, and vital to that is getting the most accurate census
possible,'' said James Hahn, the Los Angeles city attorney. ``And
we know how to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, led by House Speaker Newt Gingrich, fear that a
statistically adjusted census would be a boon to Democrats because
it would add predominantly Democratic-voting people to the
population and because they believe the administration will
manipulate the count for partisan advantages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's simple,'' said Rep. John Linder, R-Ga. ``We think they'll
cheat.''
</P>
<P>
   The importance of the census cannot be overstated in political
terms. It is used to apportion the 435 seats in the House of
Representatives among the states and to determine each state's
share of $100 billion a year of federal aid.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich favored sampling after the 1990 census, when Georgia
complained that it had been undercounted.
</P>
<P>
   After the judges rule, probably sometime within the next two
months, the Supreme Court will have the final say over sampling, a
method that uses intense surveys of some census tracts to determine
the population of other, similar tracts.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans and the White House agreed last year
to take the matter to the High Court while the Census Bureau
prepares for the 2000 Census on two tracks, one that employs only
the traditional head count and another that includes sampling.
</P>
<P>
   A separate lawsuit, filed by the Atlanta-based Southeastern
Legal Foundation, also is making its way through the federal
courts. In that suit, individuals in counties that expect to be
hurt by sampling as well as the counties themselves are challenging
the constitutionality of sampling.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles, New York, Chicago and a host of other big cities
and urban counties as well as New Mexico have joined the Commerce
Department, which includes the Census Bureau, in defending the
lawsuit filed by the House. Wisconsin, which would have lost a
congressional seat had sampling been used in the 1990 Census, is
siding with the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``One lesson that Wisconsin learned during the 1990 census was
the tremendous disincentive created by statistical estimation to
voluntary census participation,'' said Wisconsin Attorney General
James E. Doyle.
</P>
<P>
   But Harvard Law School professor Laurence Tribe, a supporter of
sampling, said he believes courts will throw out both lawsuits
because the plaintiffs lack the grounds to bring a challenge before
the census is conducted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a Potemkin Village,'' Tribe said. Until sampling is used
and the government translates census results into congressional
seats and federal funds, House Republicans and the Southeastern
Legal Foundation ``are not in a position to demonstrate that they
are concretely injured,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tribe said he believes the Supreme Court would apply the same
standard it used in throwing out a constitutional challenge to the
line-item veto on the grounds that, at the time of the challenge,
the members of Congress who sued had not suffered any harm.
</P>
<P>
   Linder, however, said Republicans will not give up their fight
even if the courts rule against them. So long as they control the
House, he said, they will refuse to provide funding for statistical
sampling in the 2000 Census.

 &HT;    Ashbury ignores critics as publishing company thrives
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Robin Asbury left the University of South Carolina Press
three years ago to launch her own publishing company in Columbia,
few of her colleagues expected her to succeed in such a risky
enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``They basically told me I was crazy,'' says Asbury. ``I was 41
and I had just had a baby when
</P>
<P>
   I started the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, thanks to unexpected tips from friends, Summerhouse
Press has become a success. A friend of a friend steered actor Jack
Palance to her with a long poem, ``Forest of Love,'' which became
her first best seller. The next bit of good fortune came when
another friend told her about Lorraine Johnson-Coleman. The
African-American storyteller's book, ``Just Plain Folks,'' resulted
in a contract as a commentator with National Public Radio and a
four-book deal with Little, Brown in the low seven figures. ``Just
Plain Folks'' is a collection of stories about African-American
burial rites, worship, courtship and cultural traditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Little, Brown deal has given us a financial base we didn't
have before,'' Asbury says. And it has brought Summerhouse a lot of
attention. At the recent BookExpo America convention in Chicago,
big publishers Ballantine and Doubleday stopped by the booth to
inquire about its fall books.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should develop a niche,'' says Asbury, who is publishing a
novel about Blackbeard the pirate and a Confederate housewife's
cookbook, ``but right now I'm just interested in finding good
writers.''
</P>
<P>
   -- DOWN ON PONCE: Casting is not completed for the movie version
of Fred Willard's novel ``Down on Ponce'' (Longstreet, $12), but
the Atlanta writer says everything else seems to be on track. ``No
shooting date has been set,'' he says. ``That'll be determined
later.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Willard has finished his second novel, ``Princess
Naughty and the Voodoo Cadillac,'' and is waiting to shop it to
publishers. Like ``Down on Ponce,'' this one is set in Atlanta.
``There are double-crosses, betrayals, shootouts and an alarming
amount of money involved,'' Willard says. One of the characters,
Ray Justice, has a porn shop that he uses to launder drug money.
Princess Naughty is his employee, and the Voodoo Cadillac is Ray's
car.
</P>
<P>
   Willard, who worked as a free-lancer and news photographer
before becoming disabled with arthritis, says one of the nice
things about success at 50 is that ``you don't have to stop and
figure out who you are.''
</P>
<P>
   -- IN THE LITERARY PIPELINE: When it comes to being prolific,
Joyce Carol Oates doesn't have to worry about competition from
Fannie Flagg. It's been 11 years since ``Fried Green Tomatoes at
the Whistle Stop Cafe'' appeared. Flagg, whose novel ``Welcome to
the World, Baby Girl'' is scheduled for fall publication, blames
the delay on screenwriting assignments and a severe case of
dyslexia. Her new novel is about a woman of Swedish descent from
Missouri, with a long-hidden secret, who becomes a famous
newscaster (think Diane Sawyer).
</P>
<P>
   -- LAMMIES: Atlanta Journal-Constitution staffer Lisa C. Moore
was a double winner recently at the Lambda Literary Awards in
Chicago. Moore won both the Lesbian Studies and the Small Press
Award for ``Does Your Mama Know?'' (Redbone), a collection of
essays that she edited.

 &HT;    Somebody's gotta do it
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA--He's arrived, late, unaware he's late, unaware he's
arrived: a post-fired, post-walked-out-on, pre-banned Norm
Macdonald.
</P>
<P>
   Macdonald is in some big identity-challenged room inside the
Ritz-Carlton Buckhead with a bunch of people trying to work up
enthusiasm for promoting ``Dirty Work,'' a new big-screen comedy
Macdonald co-wrote and stars in. It opens Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just looking forward to seeing 'Godzilla,''' says
Macdonald, who thought ``Dirty Work'' would be eaten alive at the
box office by opening the same weekend as the lizard movie. The
studio later decided to delay ``Dirty Work.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the ``Weekend Update'' host (and former ``Roseanne''
writer) was considered the funniest thing on ``Saturday Night
Live'' (Rolling Stone: ``At least there's one reason to watch
'Saturday Night Live' this year.'' TV Guide: ``(Macdonald) has
emerged as yet another 'SNL' success story'').
</P>
<P>
   Then things went in another direction: last year, virtually an
entire audience in Iowa walked out on Macdonald's stand-up act
(same thing happened later in Connecticut); late last fall, NBC
entertainment honcho Don Ohlmeyer ordered Macdonald fired from
``SNL''; and last week Ohlmeyer forbade NBC from running ads for
``Dirty Work'' (the ban has since been lifted).
</P>
<P>
   ``I retired from show business for a while,'' sums up Macdonald.
``I got to spend more time with my parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he's unretired with ``Dirty Work,'' a comedy co-starring
Jack Warden and Artie Lange (``Mad TV'') and directed by Bob Saget
(``America's Funniest Home Videos''). It's about two guys who open
a revenge business (the movie wasn't previewed for critics). When
we could catch Macdonald's attention at the Ritz, here's some
things he talked about.
</P>
<P>
   -- On what it's like being directed by Bob Saget: ``I've been
asked that question 10,000 times, and I've yet to come up with an
answer that doesn't sound like I'm lying. I mean, who were we gonna
get? I was pushing for Ricky Schroder, but he was unavailable.''
</P>
<P>
   -- On getting fired from ``SNL'': ``The president of the network
didn't like me so he fired me from the fake news. It never happened
before _ not in midseason. It's very hard to get hired on ('SNL'),
and it's even harder to get fired.''
</P>
<P>
   -- On Don Ohlmeyer: ``He's kind of a ... a ... idiot. He's not a
smart man.''
</P>
<P>
   -- On breaking into comedy: ``I did manual labor until I was 25.
Then I went to a comedy club and realized it pays better and it was
a very, very easy job. I was attracted by its complete easiness.''
</P>
<P>
   -- On why people have walked out on his act: ``They don't think
I'm funny. When you're trying to be funny and people don't think
you're funny, then they hate your guts.''
</P>
<P>
   -- On working on ``SNL'': ``I loved it. We had a free reign to
do whatever was funny. For a performer and writer, it's one of the
best places to be.''
</P>
<P>
   -- On his future on TV: ``I've been offered sitcoms. But I can't
think of one I would do. Every one I can think of seems retarded.
All I do now is stand-up.''

 &HT;    So what's so bad about the spice girls?
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JUNE 14: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   We strive for enlightenment, plan to read great books. We listen
to NPR and speculate about the future of Social
</P>
<P>
   Security and peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   And in spite of it all, we can name the Spice Girls.
</P>
<P>
   It's a chilling thought: Baby. Posh. Sporty. Scary and the
recently departed Ginger. You can't pick up a magazine, flip on the
radio or even surf the Web without stumbling across their perky
faces, blabbering on about Girl Power (``Gul Powah'' as it sounds
tripping off their south London tongues) or prancing to lyrics such
as ``ziga-zig-aaaah.''
</P>
<P>
   As distasteful as it is to admit, the very triviality of these
gals has somehow mesmerized (some might say numbed) our collective
consciousness. It's similar to stopping the remote control on late
night infomercials about the Miracle Mop or the Banjo Minnow
fishing lure _ we can't believe we're watching, but we stay tuned.
</P>
<P>
   Like a big bowl of potato chips, the Spice Girls are what they
are: junk food. They're a cheap thrill, a shallow romp in sequins
and skintight dresses whose only mission is to entertain.
</P>
<P>
   So, what's wrong with that?
</P>
<P>
   As long as you keep it in perspective, not a thing.
</P>
<P>
   When they roll into Lakewood Amphitheatre on Thursday, the
Spices are well into their 15 minutes. They've had two huge albums,
a string of state-of-the-art videos, a movie and more media
attention than when man landed on the moon. Little girls adore
them. Parents chuckle and remember cutting out pictures of Bobby
Sherman and David Cassidy. In its very meaninglessness, the group
serves a purpose _ a fleeting diversion from the realities of
day-to-day life.
</P>
<P>
   Some examples: In the best-selling Pocket Spice books, Ginger
Spice shares her thoughts: ``My favorite word is existentialism.
But I don't know what it means, and I can't even pronounce it.''
Calling from Oslo, Norway, to promote the Atlanta show, the first
of 30 phone interviews she was doing that morning, Baby Spice
chants her well-rehearsed lines like a mantra: ``We're such great
friends. We wanted to show that we'restrong and independent.'' At
theVirgin Records Web site (www.virginrecords.com), it's possible
to pull up individual interviews with the Spices. Ginger, who's
still featured on the site despite quitting the band two weeks ago,
trumped up like a tart with bright orange hair, dangling her 4-inch
heels over the armrest of a chair, says, ``Imagine, me, going to
all these pahr-ties meeting people like Lahra Dern.''
</P>
<P>
   What's really amazing about the Spice Girls is that this group
of giggly, working-class waifs has managed to take mindless dance
music and turn it into a platform for perhaps the biggest exercise
in celebrity for celebrity's sake that we have seen in decades.
They are pet rocks and Sea-Monkeys for our time. Fame isn't the
byproduct for these girls, it's the goal. As they said themselves
in their vanity film ``Spice World'': ``It's not any good, but it's
perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than ignoring the hype, the Spice Girls embraced their
manufactured nicknames to the point they have become cartoon
characters of these personas. It's a concept straight out of the
Mattel marketing department, each Spice becoming a living/breathing
Pocket Pal that little girls can dress up and hang their budding
self-images on like dolls.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere along the way, the music became secondary. The first
album, 1997's ``Spice,'' was actually a fun exercise in
unapologetic pop, spawning the hit singles ``Wannabe,'' ``Say
You'll Be There'' and ``Two Become One.'' The girls have
tenaciously claimed all along that they really, really did write
all the tunes themselves, which were as good as anything Madonna
has ever churned out. And let's face it: At least they admit they
are poseurs, unlike U2's Bono or the ubiquitous pop queen Jewel.
</P>
<P>
   The real magic of this goofy group isn't in their glitzy,
Vegas-style stage show or their inane prattle. (We all know Sporty,
Scary, Ginger, Posh and Baby are going to fade into pop obscurity
as our daughters grow up and get on with the serious business of
life.) It's on the faces of the little girls who have decided to
hop on the Spice Girls like a quick carnival ride. Of course, it'll
be over in a couple of minutes. It has no particularly redeeming
social value. But, like childhood or a spend-the-night-party, it's
over fairly quickly _ and it sure can be a lot of fun.

 &HT;    Mini reviews of the latest sights on video
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   -- ``Afterglow'' (R) _ Leaves so little aftertaste that if it
weren't for Oscar nominee Julie Christie's glow, you'd forget you'd
ever seen it. A long-wed, long-estranged couple (Christie and Nick
Nolte) unwittingly (and separately) become involved with a
maritally challenged younger couple (Lara Flynn Boyle and Jonny Lee
Miller). Sometimes, director Alan Rudolph's meandering character
studies end up somewhere remarkable. Sometimes, like this one, they
... just ... end.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C +
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The End of Violence'' (R) _ Wim Wenders' first American
work since 1984's ``Paris, Texas'' is set in Los Angeles, where the
filmmaker tries to take on everything from Big-Brother-is-watching
paranoia to big-bucks, no-brainer action flicks. Bill Pullman as a
producer of ultraviolent movies and Traci Lind as a sexy stuntwoman
are two of a half-dozen characters wandering through the strained
plot. What ensues is a movie in which teeny-tiny moments grab your
attention while the bulk of the film is like watching outtakes from
a failed Robert Altman experiment. Grade: D
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The Tango Lesson'' (PG) _ A movie with two left feet.
Filmmaker Sally Potter (``Orlando'') returns in a dual role as
director and actress. She plays a filmmaker named Sally (hmmm ...)
who funnels her creative frustrations into taking up tango lessons.
She also takes up with her tango teacher, a luscious hunk named
Pedro (Pablo Veron). The movie has its good points. The seductive
sheen of the black-and-white cinematography is one. Another is
Veron, sheer poetry in motion. But the whole thing starts to remind
you of Katharine Hepburn's ``Summertime.'' But that was in the
1950s, and Hepburn could act. This is the '90s, and Potter ...
well, let's hope what she really wants to do is direct. Grade: C -

 &HT;    Frightful sequel a screaming delight
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Scream 2'' (R)
</P>
<P>
   Still a scream _ in both the scary and the funny sense.
</P>
<P>
   Writer Kevin Williamson and director Wes Craven, the team that
made ``Scream'' the unexpected hit of 1996, take scary sequels as
their target this time around. Neve Campbell returns as our
beleaguered heroine Sidney, now enrolled in picturesque Windsor
College (it's actually Agnes Scott in Decatur), where a masked
killer is prowling around with a butcher knife.
</P>
<P>
   The players (and suspects) from the original movie include
Courteney Cox's ruthless TV reporter, David Arquette's goofy
ex-lawman, Jamie Kennedy as the video-clerk-turned-film-student,
and Liev Schrieber in his expanded role as the guy Sidney wrongly
fingered for her mother's death. Supporting players: Jada Pinkett
Smith, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Laurie Metcalfe and Jerry O'Connell.
The flick gets some of its best mileage from a film-within-a-film
based on the original ``Scream,'' remade with Tori Spelling in the
Campbell part.
</P>
<P>
   No, ``Scream 2'' can't recapture the bracing experience of the
first film. But it gets as close as you could hope for.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A -
</P>
<P>

Elm Street,'' ``Shocker,'' ``Wes Craven's New Nightmare,''

 &HT;    Romance Reviews
 &HT;    By Helen Holzer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   -- ``Hostage Bride.'' By Jane Feather. Bantam. $5.99. Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   The first in Jane Feather's ``Bride'' trilogy is a feather in
her cap and one of her best stories ever. Portia is the poor
relation, a brash, illegitimate 14-year-old caught between feuding
families in 17th-century England. Lady Olivia is her shy,
stuttering cousin, and Lady Phoebe is the ugly-duckling younger
sister of a great beauty who's rotten inside. The three girls meet
at a wedding and pledge never to marry but to follow their hearts'
desires.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Rough Around the Edges.'' By Susan Johnson, Dee Holmes,
Stephanie Laurens and Eileen Wilks. St. Martin's. $5.99. Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Four stories. Four men. And all of them ``Rough Around the
Edges.'' But these tough guys are putty in the hands of the right
women. ``Playing With Fire'' by Susan Johnson, queen of erotic
romance, is the highlight. ``Fire'' has a young duke thrown into
marriage with an equally unwilling bride because he needs her
father's money. Wish this was the whole book instead of just 80
pages.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The Perfect Scandal.'' By Kit
</P>
<P>
   Garland. Dell. $5.99. Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   The murder mystery takes a back seat to romance in this tale of
a poor little rich girl sent from America to marry British royalty.
She falls for a poor painter, and the rest is elementary.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The Bequest.'' By Candice Proctor. Ivy. $5.99. Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Writers are advised to write about what they know. Last year,
Australian Candice Proctor wrote a brilliant first novel, ``Night
in Eden'' (B+), set in Australia. Her second book, ``The Bequest,''
is an awful western about a woman who inherits a brothel. It's
chock-full of cliches and in poor taste. If there's a third book,
let's hope it's set in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The Wedding Chase.'' By Rebecca Kelley. Bantam. $5.50.
Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   This is an interesting first novel. But the murder plot is
superfluous, and the author must get rid of those names. Grizelda
and Wolfgang? Poor Grizelda wanted to marry a rich old man for his
money, while Wolf just wanted an amorous fling. Their hormones take
over, and soon ``The Wedding Chase'' is on.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Night of the Dragon.'' By Peggy Webb. Loveswept. $3.50.
Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   This ``Dragon'' is definitely a drag. It has a few interesting
moments, but this time-travel tale harking back to Camelot is
better left untold.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Texas Glory.'' By Lorraine Heath. Topaz. $5.99. Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Keep the hankies handy for teary Part 2 of a trilogy about two
Texas brothers. The first, ``Texas Destiny'' (B+), told of a bride
who falls in love with the brother of the man she's supposed to
marry. In ``Texas Glory,'' the spurned brother finds another bride,
but things go wrong once again. Lorraine Heath is a powerful writer
of westerns, but she has yet to top her masterful Civil War drama,
``Always Remember.''
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Romance of the Rose.'' By Julie Beard. Berkley. $5.99.
Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, Julie Beard has moved from grim medievals to lighter
Elizabethan themes. And what a name-dropper. William Shakespeare.
Queen Elizabeth. They're both here _ but stuck with the rest of us
_ trying to escape the Bloody Tower and the silly plot, centering
on home ownership.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Magic.'' By Kimberly Cates. Pocket. $6.50. Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Fallon calls upon an ancient legend to save her Irish people
from the hated English soldiers. When it seems that her call has
been answered, as an injured, naked man appears, she believes it's
magic. This soap opera just seems to drag on forever.

 &HT;    `The horror' Mary Thweatt painted helps others cope with disease
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA--Draw cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Thweatt put her left hand to pen and paper, closed her eyes
and let her heart guide her through ``the horror'' of breast
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Diagnosis. Mastectomy. Chemotherapy. Drowning. Self-hate.
Renewal.
</P>
<P>
   Thweatt, 81, drew each step of the disease _ and her own dread _
five years ago in an art workshop after the removal of her right
breast and three months of chemotherapy. The class was taught by
Atlanta artist Sandi Grow, who suggested that Thweatt try the
unconventional method of closing her eyes and sketching with her
nondominant hand. The technique is taken from the book ``No More
Secondhand Art: Awakening the Artist Within'' by Peter London.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd concentrate on a thought, a feeling, an emotion and try to
express it in one single line,'' Thweatt says. ``I kept doing it
repeatedly on different pieces of paper, concentrating on one
thought. Then, I would open my eyes and see if that's what I wanted
to say. Then, I'd go onto another thought or feeling. At the end of
the day, I would take out the colors and work on the design.''
</P>
<P>
   Thweatt, a retired international buyer for Rich's department
store, resumed drawing at her Buckhead townhouse after the
discovery of a cancerous lump on her neck last November.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really fell to pieces,'' she says. ``I went through the same
horror story and I started drawing again. I want to do one on my
search for peace because that's all you can do. You destroy
yourself if you just dwell on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Resembling folk art, Thweatt's images are stark and powerful,
simple drawings painted with oil color sticks. Her art will be on
display Saturday at the Swissotel at the ``Celebration of Living''
cancer survivors' events sponsored by Emory Hospitals and the
Winship Cancer Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are powerful because they come from deep within her,''
Grow says of Thweatt's work. ``Art doesn't need to be pretty. It
has to express what the artist needs to express. I think it's very
courageous of Mary to share this with others.''
</P>
<P>
   While Thweatt was taking Grow's class, she was also meeting
weekly with breast cancer survivors at an Emory Clinic support
group led by Kaye Coker, coordinator of social services.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was hesitant to show us her illustrations because she lays
no claim to being an artist,'' Coker recalls. ``But when the group
saw them, it was incredibly moving. Everyone was struck with the
resonance of the experience and how universal it is. It shows the
scars in different places, inside and out.''
</P>
<P>
   The group, which still informally gathers at members' homes, has
grown smaller in five years, from 10 women to seven. Thweatt
portrayed it in a drawing of red profiles sitting in a circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's the group when it started in 1993. This is the first
one who died,'' she gently says, pointing to a white ghostly figure
among the red. ``She was only 27 years old. Then Cheri and Sandy
died. I haven't gotten around to painting them white yet.''

 &HT;    `The horror' Mary Thweatt painted helps others cope with disease
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA--Draw cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Thweatt put her left hand to pen and paper, closed her eyes
and let her heart guide her through ``the horror'' of breast
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Diagnosis. Mastectomy. Chemotherapy. Drowning. Self-hate.
Renewal.
</P>
<P>
   Thweatt, 81, drew each step of the disease _ and her own dread _
five years ago in an art workshop after the removal of her right
breast and three months of chemotherapy. The class was taught by
Atlanta artist Sandi Grow, who suggested that Thweatt try the
unconventional method of closing her eyes and sketching with her
nondominant hand. The technique is taken from the book ``No More
Secondhand Art: Awakening the Artist Within'' by Peter London.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd concentrate on a thought, a feeling, an emotion and try to
express it in one single line,'' Thweatt says. ``I kept doing it
repeatedly on different pieces of paper, concentrating on one
thought. Then, I would open my eyes and see if that's what I wanted
to say. Then, I'd go onto another thought or feeling. At the end of
the day, I would take out the colors and work on the design.''

 &HT;    Without the violence, ``Jerry Springer'' is just another talk
show
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is ``Jerry Springer''?
</P>
<P>
   Mom is bummed. Her son Jeremy dresses like a woman. ``If he
wants to be a woman, bring me some scissors. I can take care of
that,'' Mom says.
</P>
<P>
   So Jeremy comes out, dressed in a sparkly black gown and a long
brunette wig. Mom shakes her head.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Carol. Carol's bummed because her husband Billy likes to
dress like a woman, too. Carol's also bummed because Billy _ in a
short dress, curly brunette wig and five o'clock shadow _ slept
with Jeremy the night before. ``He's the top,'' Carol explains
patiently to someone in the audience, nodding toward Jeremy. ``My
husband's the woman.''
</P>
<P>
   What's missing? All the cheap peep-show tee-hees that have
always filled ``The Jerry Springer Show'' are still there. But no
wigs were yanked off. Mom didn't slap her son silly. The spurned
wife didn't knee her unfaithful husband, then wrestle with a drag
queen until they both rolled off the back of the stage, the crowd
chanting ``Jer-RY! Jer-RY!''
</P>
<P>
   Violence-free ``Springer'' debuted this week . Two impressions:
this is still really crummy programming for a network station to
air in an after-school time period (today's topic: ``You're Too Fat
To Make Porn''); and without the violence, ``Springer'' plays like
a decade-old talk show, milking its kicks out of the kind of sexual
oddities and flamboyance we've seen a thousand times before. You're
a ... transvestite! Oooooh.
</P>
<P>
   It's ``Jenny Jones.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether this plays with a daytime viewership now sophisticated
enough to expect at least a fight a day remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   But Springer's ready. ``If we see viewers are unhappy that we're
editing stuff out, then we won't edit it out anymore,'' he said
during an MSNBC interview. ``This week the fights are going to be
edited out. Whether we continue this policy or not ... we'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Springer seemed to sum up the kind of icky, gratuitous,
been-there-seen-that perversion he's left with these days when,
looking over a freak show he'd assembled on the stage this week, he
turned to the audience and mumbled, ``Oh, God ...''

PHILADANCO: `FIBER' THAT'S THE FABRIC OF LIFE 
</HEADLINE>

(lb) 
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nearly two decades ago, Blondell Cummings created an
epochal solo, called ``Chicken Soup,'' that explored black family
life through the metaphors of the kitchen, the kitchen table and
food. Now Philadanco, also known as the Philadelphia Dance Company,
has brought us Ms. Cummings' new ``100 Percent Cotton Natural
Fiber,'' presented on Tuesday night at the Joyce Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Too sprawling, perhaps, to assume the hallmark status of
``Chicken Soup,'' ``100 Percent Cotton Natural Fiber'' is
nonetheless the work of a choreographer with a rich sense of
theater and the human condition. It was performed with passion and
authority by some of the best modern dancers around today.
</P>
<P>
   The piece is essentially a stylized, ambling processional
through time and space. It opens with a man dressed as a plantation
field hand in the American South and then doubles back and forward
to focus on groups of people who might be everything from early
African villagers to late-20th-century urban dwellers.
</P>
<P>
   Those shifts are echoed in simple, eloquent poetry by Niamini
Mutima, projected above the dancers on a backdrop whose subtly
changing shades of blue suggest the daylong passage of time.
</P>
<P>
   Frequent mention is made of the Niger, and ``100 Percent Cotton
Natural Fiber'' unfolds with the fabled leisureliness of that
mighty, winding river. Ms. Cummings has set her piece to a score
for percussion, strings and murmuring voice, created and sung on
tape by the feminist composer Oumou Sangare, that gives the dance
an African flavor. But the message of ``Natural Fiber'' is that
life experiences and dreams are common to all people, no matter
where or how they live.
</P>
<P>
   The opening passage, in which dancers are dressed in folds of
soft cotton and manipulate swatches of the material, suggests
misleadingly that the piece will be about fabric, rather than
cotton as a metaphor for human durability.
</P>
<P>
   A projected statistic about the extent of female genital
mutilation throughout the world seems out of place. But Ms.
Cummings creates the sense of an almost filmic sweep of history,
stuffed with fleeting suggestions of individual tales, that is
unusual in dance today.
</P>
<P>
   Hope Boykin, a performer of extraordinary resonance and vivid
physicality, stood out, as she always does, in a powerful cast that
also included Desiree Lynn Pina, Allyson Triplett, Candace
Whitaker, Tracy Vogt, Curtis C. Glover, Brandon Ellis, Gabriele
Tesfa Guma, William Grinton and a tiny guest performer, Alejandro
Rivera from Louis Johnson's Henry Street Kids. The costumes were by
Nancy Bours. Pat Dignan designed the lighting.
</P>
<P>
   The program was completed by an excerpt from ``La Valse,''
choreographed by Gene Hill Sagan, and ``previews,'' as the program
put it, of pieces by Ronald Kevin Brown and Milton Myers. Brown's
handsome ``Gate Keepers,'' with music by Wunmi Olaiya, was a long,
too-even flow of sculptured, hard-dancing bodies. Myers' stylish
``Echoes: A Celebration of Alvin Ailey,'' danced to music by John
Adams, had Ailey forms but little Ailey content.

YOUNG ATHLETES AREN'T GETTING THE THOROUGH SCREENING THAT CAN
DETECT HEART DISEASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALAN BAVLEY  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Millions of high school athletes throughout
the country will undergo physical exams this summer to see whether
they can safely play their sport in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   A new study, however, has found that many of these young men and
women won't be getting the kind of thorough screening for heart
disease critical to preventing death on the playing field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that good clinical practice would allow us to identify
some of these athletes'' at risk, said David Glover, a St. Luke's
Hospital physician and co-author of the study in Wednesday's
Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   The incidence of sudden cardiac deaths among high school
athletes is estimated at just one in 200,000, but with more than 6
million students playing that translates to 30 deaths a year.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago a North Kansas City High School tennis player
required cardiopulmonary resuscitation after her heart stopped.
Early last year a University of Kansas swimmer who had heart
disease died at practice.
</P>
<P>
   The American Heart Association set guidelines in 1996 that call
for doctors to take detailed family and personal medical histories
and perform thorough medical exams to identify student athletes
with severe heart disease. The association had hoped to cut the
number of sudden cardiac deaths in half.
</P>
<P>
   When Glover and co-author Barry Maron of the Minneapolis Heart
Institute Foundation reviewed the physical exam forms that state
athletic associations provide to high schools, they found that 12
states were using few or none of the heart association's
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Eight states had no recommended examination forms at all. One of
the states, Rhode Island, did not require an examination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only one-third of states have a reasonably adequate form,''
Glover said.
</P>
<P>
   Improving the exams by adding measures recommended by the heart
association shouldn't be difficult, said Glover, who practices
medicine in Warrensburg.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri's association offered the most thorough exam form in
the country, according to the researchers' criteria. Kansas tied
with the District of Columbia for the second-best exam.
</P>
<P>
   The National Federation of State High School Associations
established a sports medicine advisory committee two years ago that
is reviewing physical exams for sports participation.
</P>
<P>
   The federation, however, has no authority to require states to
use a standard medical exam, said Jerry Diehl, assistant director
of the Kansas City-based organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``The national federation cannot mandate that state associations
do anything,'' Diehl said. ``Each state association must make up
its own mind on how deep they go in their requirements. They have
to do what they think is best.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas State High School Activities Association issued a
four-page medical form this year that is required for sports
participation. The Missouri State High School Activities
Association recommends that schools use its form but does not
require it.
</P>
<P>
   The result, said family physician Larry Rues, director of the
Goppert Family Care Center in Kansas City, is that not every school
uses forms that meet the high standard set by the state
association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some forms I see brought in by high schools just don't make
any sense,'' Rues said. ``Some ask for things that aren't important
and don't ask for things that are needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Unexpected heart disease occurs at all levels of sports
competition:
</P>
<P>
   -- Boston Celtics star Reggie Lewis collapsed at a National
Basketball Association playoff game in 1993 and months later died
of heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   -- University of Kansas swimmer Seth Dunscomb died at practice
last year. An autopsy found severe enlargement of his heart.
</P>
<P>
   -- In 1996, North Kansas City High School senior Melissa
Thompson went into cardiac arrest after playing in a tennis
tournament. A doctor performed CPR that saved her life.
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier study Maron surveyed the cause of death of about
100 athletes ages 13 to 40. Most had died in or soon after
competition or practice. In about half the cases the underlying
cause was an inherited condition called hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy.
</P>
<P>
   The condition results from thickening of the wall of the heart's
main pumping chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Maron also found about 10 other genetically passed heart
abnormalities that could cause sudden death during athletics.
</P>
<P>
   The screening exam recommended by the heart association includes
checking blood pressure, listening for heart murmurs and looking
for signs of Marfan's syndrome, a hereditary disease that can cause
abnormalities of the cardiovascular system.
</P>
<P>
   The heart association said doctors also should ask athletes
whether they had experienced chest pains or trouble breathing when
exercising and whether they had a family history of heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not asking people to do much more than they have been
doing,'' Glover said. ``What we're saying is, if you're going to do
it (exams), do it right. It seems it would be an easily fixable
problem.''

THYME TO TRY AN HERB WITH CLOVE, LEMON OR CARAWAY FLAVORS
</HEADLINE>

By CAROL NUCKOLS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABCs: Thyme is a perennial whose many varieties bear green,
silver or variegated green-and-gold foliage. Flavors range from the
aromatic, slightly clovelike taste of standard thyme to caraway,
lemon and oregano. Native to the western Mediterranean, thyme
reaches 12 to 18 inches in height, 3 inches for prostrate
varieties.
</P>
<P>
   Growing conditions: Well-drained soil with plenty of sunshine.
Grow from transplants planted after last frost. Thyme requires no
fertilizer but can benefit from a light application of fish
emulsion at planting. Cut back woody branches to encourage new
growth, and start new plants every three or four years.
</P>
<P>
   Companion plants: Lavender, sage. Attracts bees, repels cabbage
worms.
</P>
<P>
   Food pairings: Meat, sausage, butter, beans, vegetables, eggs,
cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Caveat: Growing in moist, heavy soil can result in root rot and
fungal disease.

MAKING BOOKS: ART OF FOREPLAY AT THE TABLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MARTIN ARNOLD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The oldest ceremony in book publishing is the
publishing lunch. It may date back to the 15th century when, myth
has it, Johann Gutenberg bought a chunk of bratwurst for an
author's agent. And it has reeled on through mead and the
three-martini lunch to today's meal of choice, grilled fish and
iced tea.
</P>
<P>
   So in the bubbling pot of the present book world, the question
is: Are these lunches (down to about two hours from the three of
not too long ago) still useful? Or are they merely for preening?
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the answer is that they are important. That is
because even in this age of the conglomerate, book publishing
remains traditional enough to depend on rapport, and ego-driven
enough to place great importance on perceptions. Since it also
feeds on gossip and speculation, the visibility of lunch with a
personage in a power restaurant meets all these needs.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Rubin, the president and publisher of Doubleday, said:
``The only way this business works is through a network of personal
relationships. It's terribly important for a publisher to remind an
agent at lunch just how wonderful that publisher is. So much of
what we do is of the moment that you've got to remind people that
you are a player.'' That, in a nutshell, is the stratagem of the
publishing lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said that although the lunch mystique is so much about
people wanting to be on the radar screen, nonetheless ``you can
remind agents that they can send you other projects than what they
think they can send you, and that's very important for business.''
</P>
<P>
   Or one can look at the ritual as a sort of foreplay to the deals
that will be consummated elsewhere and will thus lead to the
publication of books.
</P>
<P>
   As such, it has its own rites and etiquette. For instance, the
publisher or the noted senior editor nearly always pays for lunch
and will eat only with celebrities, other publishers or senior
editors, important writers or very successful agents, and a select
few dreaded journalists.
</P>
<P>
   More protocol. An agent seldom picks up the check except for a
client or a potential client, and a major agent does not lunch with
a junior editor unless the introduction is extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
   Senior editors eat with senior agents; junior editors with
junior agents. Publishers' public relations people are interested
only in talk-show bookers or television producers and a few
reviewers and print reporters.
</P>
<P>
   What to look for: strutting. A strutting agent is one who has
just negotiated a seven-figure deal _ or at least a deep-six-figure
deal _ that everyone knows about although it's supposed to be
secret; or has a book high on the best-seller lists. A publisher
toting books means lunch with a journalist, from whom the executive
hopes to get some publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Also to be noted is the table at which the bill never arrives.
(It's quietly put on a tab in the back room somewhere, and that
means the host is truly important.) Still, the really cool appear
unconcerned and a bit careless even when given a table not quite to
their liking.
</P>
<P>
   Morton Janklow, a primal agent who actually does pay for the
lunch most of the time, says: ``It's all about schmoozing. There's
rarely something specific to talk about. You are with an editor or
publisher, and suddenly he says he could really use a book for this
fall, he doesn't have good fiction for the list, and suddenly
there's a project on the table.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Owen Laster, executive vice president of the William Morris
Agency, who also tends to pay for lunch, encourages the younger
agents in his office: ``Find the bright young editors and take them
out to lunch and be seen. I believe being seen is a kind of
important but understated part of the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Book publishing is one of the few businesses in which
competitors appear to want to spend all their time with each other,
so besides the trumpery of ``I have arrived,'' the publishing lunch
allows these competitors the comfort of being together.
</P>
<P>
   The right to lunch on the corporate credit card is a rite of
passage. It took quite a time for Barb Berg, vice president and
director of publicity for Bantam Books, to get her card. Unlike the
publishers and editors, she uses the lunches for the down and
dirty: that is, for getting publicity for her authors and books.
Which mostly means television and radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find that in their harried world, I can only get the
undivided attention of producers and bookers at lunch,'' she said.
``My lunches are all about business. It's hard to get them away
from their desks, so I always go wherever they ask, and I always
pay. It's a great coup to get their undivided attention for that
amount of time.''
</P>
<P>
   If Ms. Berg concentrates on substance at lunch, most people in
book publishing focus on place. For instance, the Grill Room of the
Four Seasons is the first temple of the publishing lunch, and among
its regular congregation are Phyllis Grann of Penguin Putnam,
Alberto Vitale of Random House, and Jack Romanos and Michael Korda
of Simon &AMP; Schuster.
</P>
<P>
   The room itself gathers together the publishers and the editors,
the authors and the agents, and gives them a setting to show
themselves in the happiest of circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Michael's is a place for book people to be seen, and it has its
regulars among the power publishers and agents. Other book places
include Orso, Lutece, for some Le Bernardin, San Pietro, Palio and,
downtown, the Union Square Cafe, where in a recent lunch hour it
was noted that the Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux people were seriously
ignoring Grove Atlantic at a nearby table, a terrible lapse in
publishing politeness.
</P>
<P>
   Which was a scene that reminds one that no matter how sociable
the lunches usually are, no matter how comforting, no matter how
casual and coy even, book publishing is a business, and in business
there's no such thing as a free lunch.

FALCON MAKES COMEBACK, WITH HELP FROM IDAHO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL DOUGAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The birds from Boise took their first flight
Tuesday _ in a box. They arrived at San Francisco International
Airport on a commercial jet.
</P>
<P>
   In a week or so, though, they'll be dive-bombing hikers at the
Marin Headlands, mastering the arduous arts of falconhood and,
according to the wildlife biologists who placed them there,
repopulating a region where peregrine falcons have not been seen
for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one time there were seven pairs nesting in sea cliffs of
Marin County and currently there are none,'' said Brian Walton who,
since 1975, has headed the Predatory Bird Research Group a the
University of California at Santa Cruz. Saving the once-endangered
peregrine falcon population has been part of his life's work.
</P>
<P>
   Only two pairs of peregrines remained in the Golden State when
the species was listed as endangered in 1970, largely because of
DDT poisoning and the predations of people with guns, Walton said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 150 peregrine pairs are known to inhabit California,
although none have returned to the cliffs of Marin, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Walton and his team, which included rangers from the Golden Gate
National Recreation Area, sought to remedy that situation two weeks
ago. They moved two male and two female fledglings from precarious
perches on the Bay Bridge to a spot on the Marin Headlands.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, those chicks were joined by six more, imported from the
Santa Cruz group's sister organization, the World Center for Birds
of Prey in Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   As Walton's team carried the young birds to their ``hack boxes''
_ or artificial nests _ they were roundly scolded by the four
peregrines already there. Having taken to wing since their arrival,
the territorial birds screeched and circled the biologists,
sometimes launching their famous attack dives, which can reach
speeds approaching 200 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Walton predicted that fewer than half the young peregrines would
survive. While they are threatened by predators like gray foxes and
horned owls, he said, the most common cause of death is starvation.
Catching food the peregrine way isn't easy, and some never get the
hang of it.
</P>
<P>
   Peregrines eat other birds, which they kill by diving _ or
``stooping'' _ from the sky at phenomenal speed, striking their
prey in midflight.
</P>
<P>
   The newly arrived peregrines will be confined to their boxes for
a week, until _ at age 42 days _ their feathers have grown in and
they'll be ready to fly, he said. Meanwhile, a team that watches
over the birds 24 hours a day will sneak up to the boxes each
night, secretly depositing dead quail for the junior birds to
devour.
</P>
<P>
   Team members observe each bird's progress, taking notes all day,
said Tim Brewton, 31, a wildlife biologist and one of the
inhabitants of the nearby team tent.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are long, arduous days in paradise,'' he said, noting
that the peregrine observation squad has put up with hot days, cold
days, 50 mph winds and rain since arriving at the spot in late May.
They will stay at least another 10 weeks, leaving only after the
birds have figured out how to catch their own prey, Brewton said.
</P>
<P>
   Then it's up to the peregrines to find new homes. All the local
bridges are taken, Walton said. One pair lives on the Golden Gate
Bridge, one on the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge and two on the Bay
Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Walton said the peregrine falcon _ nearly extinct three decades
ago _ will be removed from the endangered species list later this
summer.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The traffic on West Broadway in SoHo came to a
standstill on Sunday evening as a flatbed truck carrying what
looked like a translucent water tower inched its way toward a
250-ton crane waiting at the corner of Grand Street.
</P>
<P>
   Strollers stopped. Diners poured out of the restaurants to see
what the commotion was all about. Faces appeared in loft windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's so interesting?'' asked a bearded man on a bicycle.
``Is it Godzilla or something?''
</P>
<P>
   There were no giant lizards in sight, just a dozen or so people
_ riggers, photographers and engineers _ all focused on hoisting
the water tower onto a rooftop.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of maneuver isn't an everyday occurrence in Manhattan,
because most of the 10,000 wooden water towers that are integral
parts of the skyline were built on site, piece by piece. But then
again, this wasn't your everyday water tower.
</P>
<P>
   It was a sculpture by Rachel Whiteread, the English artist who
over the last decade has made a considerable name for herself
casting the interior volumes of familiar objects and structures in
materials like plaster, resin, concrete, wax or rubber. Objects she
has cast in this manner have ranged from water bottles to bathtubs
to an entire house.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, when the nonprofit Public Art Fund approached
Ms. Whiteread about doing a work of some sort in New York, she said
she spent days and nights walking around the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was offered various sites, like the Doris Freedman Plaza and
the Flatiron Building,'' she said. ``But I finally realized there
was no way I wanted to work on street level. New York is completely
mad. There's no peace in this city. It's chaos. I tried to find a
quiet place.'' The first time she came to New York, 15 years ago,
Ms. Whiteread remembers being amazed by the industrial brick
buildings more than the hulking skyscrapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those short, hairy buildings and the intimacy of the water
towers on top of them are what intrigued me,'' she said. ``Water
towers are like the furniture of New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Whiteread's work is all about taking objects familiar to the
everyday landscape and making people see them with fresh eyes.
Sometimes this has led to considerable controversy. ``House,'' a
concrete cast of the interior of a row house in London's depressed
East End, for instance, caused vociferous debate between city
officials who wanted to tear it down and neighbors who wanted it
left intact. The project, which was destroyed in January 1994,
became an excuse for the public to air its opinions about public
art.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want the water tower to be controversial project,''
she said. ``I want it to seem like a peaceful moment in the sky, to
echo the atmosphere of the city.''
</P>
<P>
   The skyline on the corner of West Broadway and Grand Street
looks almost the same as it did before Ms. Whiteread's
installation: a cluster of small buildings topped with water
towers. But the newest tower commands a second look: The
translucent resin changes color from green to white throughout the
day, depending on the sunlight. At one point during the
installation, one passer-by thought it was a block of ice about to
melt.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Whiteread's work has always stood out. In 1995, she became
the first woman to win the coveted $32,000 Turner Prize, given
annually by the Tate Gallery in London to an artist whom its jury
considers the best representative of contemporary British art. But
even before she captured that prize, Ms. Whiteread's projects had
been known and exhibited throughout Europe and the United States.
She is at work on a Holocaust memorial in Vienna, a large concrete
casting of an inside-out library, with the books on the outside.
</P>
<P>
   Each of these projects is ambitious, and each comes with its
share of problems. In planning the water tower, for example, Ms.
Whiteread had to find the right tower to cast and the right site.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted an old tank, because of the grain of the wood
embossed on the surface,'' she said. The venerable American Pipe
and Tank Lining Co. in Manhattan ended up giving her a 25-year-old
wooden tank. And the company's owners, Steven and Richard Silver,
found the site. They remembered removing an old tank from the
building and, together with Tom Eccles, director of the Public Art
Fund, approached the building's owners to see how they would feel
about having a Rachel Whiteread work on their roof. Fortunately,
they turned out to be contemporary-art lovers.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the problem of finding the right material. ``I
wanted a tough, ultraviolet material that would withstand weather
changes,'' said Ms. Whiteread. After extensive research, she
discovered a company in California and visited it three months ago
to test the material and make sure it would give the desired
translucent effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happiest showing things in daylight,'' she said. When the
material arrived in New York, fabricators cast the tower as a whole
and eventually polished the surface until they achieved the desired
texture.
</P>
<P>
   The process sounds easier than it was. At one point, the
internal structure gave way because of the immense heat and
pressure from the casting. ``We underestimated what the problems
would be,'' Ms. Whiteread said. ``Eventually we resolved them.''
</P>
<P>
   The installation, though it had to be carefully managed, went
smoothly by comparison. Because the tower weighs about 9,500
pounds, a 250-ton crane with a 195-foot boom had to be used to
hoist it to the roof. (The weight may seem considerable, but it is
actually minimal compared to the average New York City water tower,
which can weigh 40,000 to more than 300,000 pounds, depending on
size.)
</P>
<P>
   The cost of the project, $270,000, was the most the 20-year-old
Public Art Fund has spent on a single artist. Funds came from
several sources, including the New York arts program of Beck's, the
German brewery.
</P>
<P>
   Although the average life span of a New York City water tower is
25 years, Ms. Whiteread expects hers to last a lot longer. It will
stay at its current site for about a year and then, she said, she
envisions it being shown in a gallery or museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's rare that I make a public piece that's movable,'' she
said. ``But I would like to keep it in New York, because that's
where its home is. It was born here.''

 &HT;     ARAB AMERICANS TO FOCUS ON `TARGETED' DISCRIMINATION AT MEETING
 &HT;     With US-ARABS-BOX.
 &HT;     By SAMAR ABULHASSAN 
 &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Labeled a ``threat to national security,'' Nasser
Ahmed has been imprisoned _ in solitary confinement _ for more than
two years. The reason: ``secret evidence'' he is not allowed to
see.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed, a 37-year-old engineer, has now gone on a hunger strike
after being transferred from a New York City detention center to a
federal prison upstate earlier this week, according to his attorney
Abdeen Jabara.
</P>
<P>
   His is one of 14 cases in which the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service is attempting to deport immigrants it deems
have political affiliations that make them a threat to national
security _ again, based on secret evidence.
</P>
<P>
   This so-called ``targeting'' of Arabs and Muslims by the federal
government will take center stage when an expected 2,000 Arab
Americans begin a four-day meeting here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno, who currently faces a lawsuit
pending before the U.S. Supreme Court on this very issue, is
scheduled to address the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination
Committee convention on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   While spokesman Michael Gordon said it still wasn't clear if
Reno would address the issue in her remarks, it is difficult to see
how she will be able to avoid it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every single one of these cases involves an Arab or a
Muslim,'' said Jabara, who called the use of secret evidence ``the
most pressing problem facing Arab Americans today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This sends a message not only that you are a suspect
community, but that you are defenseless,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Arab Americans, though one of the most affluent and
fastest-growing minority groups in the United States, often find
themselves negatively stereotyped by the same American society they
embrace.
</P>
<P>
   Tragic events such as the Federal Trade Center and Oklahoma City
bombings, and memories of the Iran hostage crisis, all bolstered by
Hollywood stereotypes in popular movies such as ``True Lies,'' have
made it difficult for Arab Americans to even move through airports
without causing suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in a healthy dose of disunity, and you've got a perfect
recipe for an ineffective lobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arab Americans have to rise, and they have to make a fuss and
build coalitions,'' said Rashid Khalidi, a University of Chicago
professor who will discuss U.S. policy toward the Palestinian cause
at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   He said for the Arab lobby to equal the Jewish lobby _ which he
called the strongest ethnic group in the world _ is a matter of
``hard work and assimilation.''
</P>
<P>
   But ADC president Hala Maksoud said the targeting of Arabs in
anti-immigrant, anti-terrorism legislation has brought an at times
divided community together.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're identifying as Arab Americans as we haven't before,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   That will help, she said, when it comes to fighting laws such as
the Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   While ``secret evidence'' was used to deport immigrants for
years, according to Georgetown University law professor David Cole,
it wasn't until after the law was passed that the INS began
``aggressive and systematic'' use of the practice ``in a disturbing
pattern.''
</P>
<P>
   Cole is also representing Ahmed, an Egyptian, and working with
the American Civil Liberties Union on a constitutional challenge to
his detention.
</P>
<P>
   Malea Kiblan, a Virginia-based attorney specializing in
immigration, said a part of the problem lies in an unclear
definition of what constitutes a terrorist organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter,'' said
Kiblan, who will address this issue at a civil rights workshop on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   She will also discuss the sweeping changes of the 1996 Illegal
Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act _ which, among
other things, imposed new income requirements for families wishing
to bring relatives from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``People need to know what their rights are,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Also to be addressed is what the group calls the ``targeting''
of travelers going to certain destinations under a computerized
Federal Aviation Administration profiling program developed in
response to the crash of TWA Flight 800 in 1997. A commission
headed by Vice President Al Gore last year expanded profiling
procedures to include anything from putting extra tags on a
``suspect's'' bags to taking a traveler aside for questioning.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA has repeatedly insisted that profiling is not based on
racial and religious distinctions, however, more than 200 Arab
Americans filed reports with ADC last year, said Ghada Khouri, a
spokeswoman for the group.
</P>
<P>
   While those complaints are down since the FAA replaced the
manual profiling system with the computerized system this year,
they have not ceased, Khouri said.
</P>
<P>
   In a move that has already sparked controversy, the ADC will
mark what they call ``50 years of Palestinian dispossession,'' a
counter-point to Israel's 50th Anniversary celebration this year,
said Muhammad Hallaj, who will moderate a discussion on the stalled
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
   That theme of ``dispossession'' will be symbolized by the
display of a giant quilt project on the Mall during a final rally
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The quilt, made up of 418 pieces in the four colors of the
Palestinian flag, was stitched by women across the country.
Embroidered on each piece is the name, population and date of each
village lost in the 1948 Arab-Israeli war ``to make visual the loss
of the Palestinians,'' Maksoud said.
</P>
<P>
   Maksoud notes that the quilt project, which has toured 10 major
cities before reaching Washington, has been criticized in the
Jewish community, who ``says we have no interest in making peace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We find this very disturbing,'' she said. ``Why is it that
when it comes to us, they went us to forget our past?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We do it to learn lessons for the future,'' she said.

`THE SECRET LIFE OF BARBIE': WHAT A DOLL
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are
for New York area. Check local listings.) 
(ja) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The breasts of Barbie, those peaks of American merchandising,
receive their due in Thursday's report on the sexy little miss _
now 40 years old, although you wouldn't know it _ who
revolutionized global dolldom.
</P>
<P>
   Delving into ``The Secret Life of Barbie,'' Robert Krulwich goes
to Barbie's creator and developer, Ruth Handler, for an account of
how she beat down the resistance of prudish male executives at
Mattel, the big toy company that she and her husband founded, and
made them all rich.
</P>
<P>
   Our engaging correspondent talks to middle-aged women who
cherish memories of their Barbie collections and to
deconstructionists of her construction, noting along the way how
Mattel has played hardball with competitors bent on imitating the
inimitable.
</P>
<P>
   It all began on a trip to Europe when Ms. Handler came upon a
sex toy, known as Bild Lilli; Krulwich calls her a ``slutty doll
from Germany,'' but Ms. Handler's vision of pulchritude for kids
and some heavy television advertising carried the day.
</P>
<P>
   While becoming the most popular and profitable toy of all time,
Barbie gave two generations of academics something to get their
teeth into; on Thursday you can meet a woman who is identified as
``a Barbie scholar.''
</P>
<P>
   Exegetes agree that ``Barbie is about sex.'' Soon she was joined
by Ken, described here as ``a palpable idiot'' with the hint of a
bump where his genitalia ought to be. Camille Paglia, always good
for a quotable observation, sees Barbie as leading the movement
toward female liberation: a professional woman with glamour. (But
why does my 3-year-old granddaughter, Rebecca, insist on removing
her hair?)
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the basic appeal, the marketeers kept pace with
fashion. During Camelot, Barbie had a Jackie Kennedy hairdo. As the
civil-rights movement gained support, Barbie gained her first black
friend, unfortunately named Colored Francie.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such signs of social awareness, sales dipped as the
1960s turned into the 1970s, when Barbie seemed out of step with
liberation movements and Mattel got into legal trouble with the
government.
</P>
<P>
   But she found favor again as a Reagan-era go-getter, ``the queen
of conspicuous consumption,'' someone crowns her. Equipped with all
manner of outfits, she was also the New Woman who could be anybody
and do anything. With sales approaching $2 billion a year, Barbie
became, in Krulwich's slightly mixed image, ``the Coca-Cola of
toys.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics like Dr. Ruth Westheimer still don't like those breasts,
which, they warn, may stir girls' anxieties over their own
imperfectly proportioned bodies, but nobody is picketing; 100
million Barbies are likely to be sold around the world this year.
The exciting promise of 1998 is a refigured Barbie: Will she be
fatter or flatter? A glimpse on Thursday reveals no dramatic
difference, except, be assured, to students of her form.
</P>
<P>
   The program ends with a scene of children making up stories
featuring their Barbies and Kens: An admirer notes contentedly that
the youngsters are in control of this little piece of global
commerce. Other adults, who have been visiting toy stores and
watching television commercials, may come away with a different
take on who is controlling these young controllers.

     PANELS OVERSEEING DRUG TRIALS ARE
OVERWORKED, UNDERFUNDED, REPORT SAYS
 &HT;     By JEFF NESMITH 
 &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The safety of persons who volunteer to take
experimental drugs is being jeopardized by the fact that committees
overseeing the drug trials are overworked and underfunded, federal
investigators are to report Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Institutional Review Boards, made up of scientists and outside
``community representatives,'' review and approve proposals for
drug trials at universities, medical centers and other
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   But a series of reports to be released by the inspector general
of the Department of Health and Human Services warns that the
system is being jeopardized by the fact that the boards are
overworked and understaffed.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, drug companies often ``shop'' for friendly review
boards, known as ``IRBs,'' further compromising the system's
effectiveness, the investigators are expected to report.
</P>
<P>
   ``The safety net intended to protect human research subjects
appears to be showing signs of age and disrepair,'' said Rep.
Christopher Shays, R-Conn., whose Human Resources subcommittee is
to release the inspector general reports at a hearing Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a system in jeopardy of failing to provide even minimal
protections against unavoidable research risks,'' Shays added.
</P>
<P>
   The IRB system was created in the 1970s in response to reports
that human research volunteers were inadequately protected and
informed of the risks they faced. In effect, federal regulators
began ``farming out'' the job of policing trials to the
institutions where the research was being conducted.
</P>
<P>
   The IRBs must approve, in addition to federally funded trials,
advance plans for drug company-sponsored trials of products that
will be considered for licensing by the Food and Drug
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   That covers virtually all clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
   However, with the explosion of drug research that has taken
place in the past decade, the committees are overworked, said
Arthur Caplan, director of the University of Pennsylvania Center
for Bioethics and himself a member of an IRB.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IRBs are just swamped,'' Caplan said. ``Some large
institutions get hundreds of research proposals each month. There's
no way every member of an IRB is going to carefully read several
hundred proposals, so they end up setting up subcommittees to
review the proposals and report back to the full IRB.''
</P>
<P>
   Before approving a proposed drug experiment, the IRB is charged
with such duties as making sure the trial will be monitored to
catch any adverse reactions and ensuring that volunteers are
adequately informed of the risks they face. Subtle wording in the
``informed consent'' forms that all volunteers must read and sign
can underemphasize risks involved while playing up potential
benefits, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Caplan noted that federal regulations require that IRBs include
``outside members,'' such as physicians or lawyers, but do not
specify their qualifications. Therefore in some cases, retired drug
company salesmen have served on IRBs.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, members of the boards are usually scientists who
volunteer their time and in many cases are provided with little or
no staff support.
</P>
<P>
   Simple matters such as whether minutes are taken of IRB
discussions, files are adequately maintained and the way IRB
meetings are scheduled can have profound impacts on the well-being
of trail participants, Caplan said.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem involves so-called ``IRB shopping,'' a practice
in which a pharmaceutical manufacturers will offer researchers at
several institutions the opportunity to conduct a drug trial and
award the work to the scientists with the most pliable IRB, Caplan
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The companies sometimes take the position that they are paying
for the research, and they might as well have it done at the
institution that gives them the least grief,'' he said. ``It's not
a malicious thing, where they are trying to smuggle in a bad
proposal, but they are often looking for speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there are independent IRBs that are not connected with
research institutions, and some researchers turn to these groups
for approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, there have been occasions where IRBs were created for
the purpose of approving specific drug trials,'' he said. ``That
practice is ethically pathetic and undercuts the purpose of the
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Shays said IRBs also are vulnerable to institutional pressures
to conform ``and to cronyism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Missing are periodic evaluations and external oversight needed
to maintain a rigorous, vigilant bioethical review system,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to representatives of the Health and Human Services
inspector general, Thursday's hearing will receive testimony from
drug companies, IRB members, ethicists and representatives of
medical colleges.

BUSH STILL ADAPTING TO WEALTH WITH SALE OF TEXAS RANGERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush, who becomes a
multimillionaire this week with the sale of the Texas Rangers
baseball team, said Wednesday he is still adjusting to his new
wealth and doesn't yet know how he will spend the money.
</P>
<P>
   There has been speculation Bush will spend part of the $10
million he is expected to receive from the Rangers' sale on a race
for president in 2000, should he win his re-election race this
year.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush said he hasn't decided on a race for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said he will ``pay a lot of tax, for starters'' on
his share of the Rangers' deal.
</P>
<P>
   He said he probably will save some but wasn't sure what he would
do with the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had time to adjust,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball owners were expected to approve the sale Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The ownership group that includes Bush has agreed to sell the
American League team to Dallas investor Tom Hicks, who also owns
the National Hockey League's Dallas Stars, for $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's profits grew from a $600,000 investment he made in 1989
for a 1.8 percent ownership in the team. &QL;

By NEIL STRAUSS c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Concert audiences in Japan have a reputation as quiet
spectators who mystify Western musicians by hardly even clapping
between songs. But when the German electronic-pop pioneers
Kraftwerk performed three concerts at the Akasaka Blitz for a
sold-out crowd of 2,500 people a night last week, the response was
deafening.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of listeners, most of whom weren't even born when
Kraftwerk formed, whistled and applauded wildly between numbers,
even singing along with ``Pocket Calculator.''
</P>
<P>
   The enthusiasm made sense not just because Kraftwerk is on its
first tour in 17 years, but because Tokyo is a world of
miniaturized electronics, robotic efficiency, high-speed trains and
techno music. It is a world where Kraftwerk's electric dreams have
best come to life.
</P>
<P>
   By far the world's most influential band in electronic music,
Kraftwerk has been as mysterious as it has been important, working
quietly in its Kling Klang Studio in Duesseldorf and letting years
elapse between albums, interviews and performances.
</P>
<P>
   In an extremely rare interview, his first with an American
reporter in more than 15 years, Ralf Huetter, one of the band's
reclusive founders and conceptual masterminds, said that smaller,
affordable and portable music technology was the reason Kraftwerk
was on the road again. (The band is scheduled to perform June 13 at
the Hammerstein Ballroom in New York and June 14 at the Tibetan
Freedom Concert in Washington.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we can play the music the way we feel artistically we
should be playing it,'' Huetter said. ``Before it was all
compromising, and some machines and programs were not really
transportable. Today we have access to all our computer programs
and can interact live with them. We're very lucky to be composing
music in this time. It's all at your fingertips. In the 19th
century you'd probably need to have a rich donor or king or
community giving you 80 people for an orchestra.''
</P>
<P>
   For the tour, Huetter said, the band brought the entire contents
of its studio and assembled it onstage every night. ``We're playing
our studio on the road,'' he said. ``It's everything we have. We
left empty studios in Duesseldorf.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Kraftwerk was to electronic dance music what the
Beatles were to rock music: innovators who developed new standards,
codes and benchmarks for the musicians who followed them. Since
breaking into the American Top 40 with the song ``Autobahn'' in
1974, the band has been transformed from a novelty into a legend.
</P>
<P>
   Its robotlike image, automated music and concept-laden albums
from the '70s may seem like the epitome of uptight European
art-school dogma, but the music nonetheless crossed barriers of
race and nationality, perhaps because it stressed the importance of
the instrument, or machine, which has no such identity, over the
human being playing it.
</P>
<P>
   The performers who first solidified styles like disco,
electro-funk, rap, new wave, industrial and techno all acknowledged
a debt to Kraftwerk's music and its use of the recording studio not
just as an instrument but as a composer. At times, the band would
let its machines run on their own to see what developed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We consider our music as ethnic music in a way,'' Huetter
said. ``It is from postwar Germany. As you probably know, Germany
has a very long history of art and music. Being the first postwar
generation, we were without any line of historical continuity. We
just started from zero. Culturally speaking, we didn't have our own
musical language. At first we had to find some kind of sound,
create some kind of industrial sound, and then we added voices.''
</P>
<P>
   The process began when Huetter and Florian Schneider, two
classically trained musicians, began improvising on the hippie
progressive rock of the late '60s and early '70s. They recorded
first as the Organisation and then as Kraftwerk before spurning
rock altogether and making music reflective of an industrial era
but prescient of a computer age.
</P>
<P>
   Today it's not just the band's automated dance music that still
seems current, it's also the band's ideas. Its cautionary album
``Radioactivity,'' though more than 20 years old, still relates to
current events in India. Its dreams of traveling through a
borderless Europe, related in ``Trans-Europe Express'' from 1977,
have come closer to reality.
</P>
<P>
   Its visions the next year on ``Man Machine,'' of human beings
and electronics fusing as machine beings, have in a sense come true
as people have become dependent on cell phones, electronic
organizers and other battery-operated extensions of themselves.
They have also almost literally become true as people have created
computer personalities on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Internet and immaterial transportation of information
images, technology has developed very much in our direction,''
Huetter said.
</P>
<P>
   Logically, Kraftwerk's influences would seem to be the
city-as-symphony manifestoes of the Futurists; the mid-century
electronic music studies that took place in radio studios in Paris
and Cologne, Germany; the prankish anything-goes artwork of the
Fluxus collective; the studio craft of albums by the Beatles and
the Beach Boys.
</P>
<P>
   But Huetter was reluctant to cite influences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course this music was part of our cultural situation,'' he
said. ``We lived near the Cologne radio station and saw a couple of
Fluxus concerts, but to us it was part of our environment. It
seemed quite normal to create music in today's technological
society with new instruments. Why play an instrument with
19th-century technology and a limited sound range when today's
instruments have so many more variations? When you go to your
doctor or your dentist, you don't want him to use a wooden hammer.
You should expect from music the same as what you expect from
science or medicine, to be working with up-to-date technology.''
</P>
<P>
   For Kraftwerk, working with cutting-edge technology without
using excessively large, sonically limited and costly equipment
initially meant that the band had to cut and splice audiotape and
design its own instruments, like electronic drum pads, synthesizers
and sequencers. Technology has since caught up with Kraftwerk, and
the music it struggled so hard to make is now commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``A very long time ago we were outsiders, but always we had this
vision of electronic music as the new Volkswagen,'' Huetter said.
``It's transportable _ you can do it in your home, you can do it
anywhere _ and therefore we always had this vision of this techno
music.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In concert, Kraftwerk embraces the ambiguities of live
electronic music. It performs surrounded by banks of
mysterious-looking devices, the functions of which are unclear. For
all the audience at a Kraftwerk show knows, the music could be
entirely recorded. In fact, during the song ``We Are the Robots,''
the band is nowhere to be seen onstage. Instead, robot torsos and
heads are suspended in the air, slowly twisting and waving as the
music plays on. Huetter, however, said that much of the music is
played live, changed from night to night and even improvised at
times.
</P>
<P>
   Malfunctions aside, the biggest difficulty of touring with so
much equipment has been customs declarations. ``We have to have
long lists of inventory with numbers for every instrument or
device,'' Huetter said. ``People fear we're bringing in some kind
of weapon. In some countries, we're not even allowed to take in our
mainframes because they could be misused to program missiles. But
they're only there to make music. Art and technology are always
very closely linked.''
</P>
<P>
   Though it may seem like Kraftwerk has been on a long leave of
absence, Huetter said that the band has been working nonstop at
Kling Klang creating new songs, updating their computer programs
and instruments, making films and briefly considering a
collaboration with the German film director Wim Wenders.
</P>
<P>
   In concert, the band performs instrumental versions of two works
in progress, which it hopes to include on an album that Huetter
describes as ``nearly finished.'' He plans to follow the album with
a larger, conceptually different tour next year.
</P>
<P>
   When asked what music he's been listening to, Huetter said that
he doesn't buy many records, most of which he considers ``aural
pollution.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We just walk around, and sometimes we go out and dance, and
then we listen to the environment,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Huetter also does a lot of bicycling, and recently returned from
a cycling trip in Spain. In fact, Huetter said that when he
delivered new songs to his record company, EMI, the receptionist
mistook him for a bicycle messenger and refused to believe he
recorded for the label.
</P>
<P>
   Despite repeated prodding, Huetter would not reveal the concept
of Kraftwerk's next album. But considering that the band has sung
about bicycles, cars, trains and automobiles, wouldn't the logical
next step for these technology worshipers be to sing about
airplanes and space travel?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Huetter replied. ``We're afraid of flying.''

     GATES: GOVERNMENT ATTEMPTS TO BLOCK
ENCRYPTION ARE FUTILE
 &HT;     Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;     By ANDREW J. GLASS 
 &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a digital age, crime-fighters can no longer
count on deciphering coded messages to catch spies or crooks,
several of the nation's top software executives warned Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just a fact of life,'' said Microsoft's Bill Gates,
adding , ``It's a change in the world of spying and law enforcement
that we cannot affect. I realize that it makes their job tougher.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates's views were echoed at a news by a Microsoft business
rival, Eric Schmidt, chairman of Novell, who declared: ``The genie
is out of the bottle.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt contended that U.S. officials ``appear to be running a
jobs export program'' by barring Novell, Microsoft and others from
exporting their most advanced encryption systems even as foreign
firms craft similar or even better encoding tools.
</P>
<P>
   Despite several attempts to fashion a compromise under pressure
from the White House and Congress, law enforcement officials remain
deeply at odds with the software industry over the encryption
issue.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI wants Congress to pass a law that requires all encoding
programs to carry a hidden ``back door'' that would permit its
agents to tap into Internet messages under a court order, as they
are able to do today with phone taps. The FBI plan calls for
providing a trusted third party with a digital ``key'' that would
be available in conducting criminal or intelligence investigations.
</P>
<P>
   But the Business Software Alliance, an industry trade that
sponsored the news conference, countered with a study which held
that a government bid to curb Internet encryption would cost users
at least $7.7 billion a year and $38.5 billion over five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we've said in the past, encryption policy must be guided by
the digital Hippocratic Oath _ first, do no harm,'' said Schmidt.
``The high cost of the key escrow system documented in this study
does not pass this test.''
</P>
<P>
   In return for a ``key,'' the Clinton administration is willing
to lift its strict export controls on more powerful U.S.-made
encryption tools. The industry holds that it has been slow to
design truly unbreakable codes, which could further advance
Internet commerce, because it has effectively ceded the world
market to overseas competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The standoff led on Tuesday to a summit conference between
government and industry leaders, including Attorney General Janet
Reno, FBI Director Louis Freeh and Thomas Constantine, head of the
Drug Enforcement Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was sponsored by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., a
key player on Capitol Hill on technology issues.
</P>
<P>
   About all that was decided in what Gates termed ``a good
exchange'' was that the group would meet soon again. ``There wasn't
any agreement to change our position,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The trade group also released a report on the benefits of
electronic commerce predicting that direct business-to-business
transactions in cyberspace in 2000 would range from $66 billion to
$171 billion. By 2002, the study foresaw electronic commerce
reaching the $300 billion level.

to lift its strict export controls on more powerful U.S.-made
encryption tools. The industry holds that it has been slow to
design truly unbreakable codes, which could further advance
Internet commerce, because it has effectively ceded the world
market to overseas competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The standoff led on Tuesday to a summit conference between
government and industry leaders, including Attorney General Janet
Reno, FBI Director Louis Freeh and Thomas Constantine, head of the
Drug Enforcement Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was sponsored by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., a
key player on Capitol Hill on technology issues.
</P>
<P>
   About all that was decided in what Gates termed ``a good
exchange'' was that the group would meet soon again. ``There wasn't
any agreement to change our position,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The trade group also released a report on the benefits of
electronic commerce predicting that direct business-to-business
transactions in cyberspace in 2000 would range from $66 billion to
$171 billion. By 2002, the study foresaw electronic commerce
reaching the $300 billion level.

COMMENTARY: PREGNANCY AND ADDICTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Ky., Ohio, S.C., Nev.)  (Eds.: Malissa in 2nd graf cq) 
(JT) 
 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last fall the Supreme Court of South Carolina, in a bizarre 3-2
decision, ruled that a viable fetus is legally a ``child'' and that
therefore a pregnant woman who does something detrimental to the
fetus can be prosecuted for child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Malissa Ann Crawley smoked cocaine when she was pregnant in
1991. It doesn't matter that her son from that pregnancy is now 6
years old and quite healthy, or that Ms. Crawley overcame her drug
habit, obtained employment and has successfully been raising three
children. Those kids are now with relatives and Ms. Crawley is in
prison because of a criminal justice policy that is irrational and
extreme, and law enforcers who frequently are merciless.
</P>
<P>
   As a judge told one of Ms. Crawley's lawyers, ``I'm sick and
tired of these girls having these bastard babies on crack cocaine
and until they change the law, the law they gave me, it said I
could put them in jail.''
</P>
<P>
   In March, her legal appeals having failed, Ms. Crawley entered
state prison to begin serving a term of five years.
</P>
<P>
   Few people are suggesting that society close its eyes to
behavior that is potentially very harmful to fetuses. But drug
addiction, like alcoholism, is a public-health problem. Breaking up
functional families in order to send the mother up the river for a
long stretch is hardly the answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Malissa was doing a great job with her kids,'' said C. Rauch
Wise, one of the lawyers representing Ms. Crawley. ``My frank
opinion is that more harm is being done to those children by her
being in jail than was ever even remotely done to the 6-year-old by
her cocaine use.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1989 law enforcement officials in parts of South Carolina
have zeroed in on a particular class of pregnant women at public
hospitals who test positive for illegal drug use. Dozens have been
arrested, virtually all of them African-Americans who went to the
hospitals for prenatal care or to deliver babies.
</P>
<P>
   In Charleston, 30 women were arrested ``out of their hospital
beds'' at the Medical University of South Carolina, according to
the Center for Constitutional Rights in New York, which is
providing legal assistance to some of the women. A briefing paper
prepared by the center said, ``Many were taken away in chains and
shackles, some still bleeding from delivery.''
</P>
<P>
   The arrests at the Medical University stopped in 1994 following
an investigation by the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services. But the arrest and prosecution of pregnant women and new
mothers in South Carolina continued, although with less vigor.
</P>
<P>
   Now proponents of such prosecutions have the State Supreme Court
ruling to bolster their dangerous efforts. Health-care and social
service officials in South Carolina are required by law to report
evidence of child abuse. With a viable fetus having the same legal
status as a child, these officials face criminal prosecution and
possible imprisonment themselves for failing to notify authorities
of women who are taking drugs, drinking or engaging in other
behavior that poses a risk to the fetus.
</P>
<P>
   The South Carolina ruling is unprecedented. It is the first time
in the post-Roe era that the highest court of any state has upheld
the prosecution of a woman for behavior that endangered a fetus.
All other top courts that have addressed the issue, including the
supreme courts of Florida, Kentucky, Nevada and Ohio, have ruled
the other way.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials in South Carolina who favor the
prosecutorial approach say their goal is to protect the fetus and,
by holding out the threat of imprisonment, to encourage the mothers
to seek drug treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Most health-care professionals and organizations, including the
American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics
and the March of Dimes, believe that is a wildly misguided
approach. Pregnant women who are addicted to drugs and know that
health-care officials are required by law to report them to the
authorities will, in many cases, refuse to seek either prenatal
care or drug-abuse counseling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that drug treatment, when available, can work,''said
Lynn Paltrow, a lawyer who also represents Malissa Crawley. ``But
we have reached a point culturally, it seems, where people think
the only way to encourage responsibility is to imprison people.''

<P>
   TORONTO _ Each stroll in the neighborhood opens new worlds for
Guillermo Sambra. He gawks at the shoes and radios in Toronto's
store windows and shakes his head in disbelief at the gleaming new
cars that actually stop to let him cross the street.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Sambra's world was limited to one
cockroach-infested Cuban prison cell where he was serving an
eight-year sentence for the crime of distributing election
material.
</P>
<P>
   After five years and four months in jail, Sambra, now 27, was
suddenly told that he was being released. One day last month, he
was put on a jet along with his wife and daughter and sent to
Canada to begin life again. In all, 17 Cuban dissidents have been
exiled to Canada since Pope John Paul II urged Fidel Castro early
this year to throw open the doors of his prisons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like a newborn,'' said Sambra, a slightly built young
man with hollow cheeks, dark sunken eyes and a pain in his stomach
that developed in prison and is a constant reminder of his time
there. He arrived in Toronto with little more than the clothes on
his back. ``When the plane left Cuba I felt as if a great weight
had dropped off of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Canada is a land of immigrants and that is especially true of
Toronto, which is peopled by so many newcomers from so many
different parts of the world that at times it feels more like an
international airport terminal than a city.
</P>
<P>
   But few immigrants arrive here with such a depth of disbelief as
Sambra and the other Cubans. For them, not only is the richness of
North America staggering, but also its very existence represents a
challenge to lifelong ways of thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Since he landed at Toronto's Pearson International Airport,
Sambra said he had learned that contrary to what was drilled into
him at home in Santiago, the island's second most important city,
communist Cuba is not the only place with universal medical care.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to pay anything here,'' said Sambra, who has
had free medical exams since he arrived. ``I thought that the only
country in the world where that happened was Cuba.'' He and his
wife, Miriam, and their daughter, Jessica, have been given landed
immigrant status in Canada, which automatically entitles them to
all the benefits of Canadian citizenship, without allowing them to
vote. They can apply for citizenship in three years.
</P>
<P>
   Sambra's euphoria may be tempered when he finds himself paying
Canada's high taxes or suffering through a northern winter. But for
now even the simplest aspect of life takes on great significance.
The cars that stop at crosswalks have quickly become his favorite
symbol of Canada, a land, he said, where even powerful machines can
be stopped by the individual rights of ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The automobile has the force, it's made of steel and the
people are just flesh and bones,'' he said. In Cuba, drivers lean
on their horns when approaching pedestrians, expecting them to give
way. ``But here,'' he said, ``the person has the right to go
first.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he was jailed on charges of rebellion, Sambra considers
himself an unlikely rebel. Before he was imprisoned in 1993, he had
lived his entire life in his grandfather's house. He had not gone
beyond the 10th grade and his only dream was to pick up his
grandfather's trade, keeping old American-made, pre-revolution
General Electric, Westinghouse and Philco refrigerators running as
long as possible.
</P>
<P>
   He said the communist newspapers in Cuba never tired of
publishing articles about how bad things were in the United States
and, it sometimes seemed, every country but Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every place seemed to be so bad that you figured you might as
well stay in Cuba,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the isolation and misinformation, the never-ending
shortages of food and clothing made him suspect that what the
newspapers said could not be true. His dissatisfaction gnawed at
him.
</P>
<P>
   His mother and father had divorced long ago but he knew his
father, Ismael, was an important writer and television producer,
who also felt cheated by life in Cuba. When the elder Sambra began
distributing anti-government campaign literature before the
1992-1993 local and national elections, Guillermo did so too.
</P>
<P>
   The offending words on the pamphlets he slipped under doors were
simple: liberty, dignity, independence. The underlying message was
a direct challenge to Castro's old chant of ``Socialism or death.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We said, `No socialism. No death. No Castro,''' the younger
Sambra said.
</P>
<P>
   Early one morning, five armed policemen came for Guillermo
Sambra. They hauled him in for questioning. Eventually he was
transferred to a grim state prison that baked during the day and
swarmed with insects at night. Clouds of mosquitoes filled the cell
and constant dampness attracted roaches.
</P>
<P>
   A month after Guillermo was arrested, police came back for his
father. Both were eventually found guilty of rebellion. Guillermo
was sentenced to eight years. His father got 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian chapter of PEN, the international writer's group,
began a campaign to free the elder Sambra, which was furthered by
the Canadian government. Canada ignores the U.S. embargo and
maintains diplomatic and commercial relations with Cuba. In the
last two years, Canadian officials have moved to strengthen those
ties while pushing the Cubans to improve their record on human
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Ismael Sambra was freed from prison just over a year ago and
exiled to Canada, where he has taken up the post of scholar in
residence at York University in Toronto.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Life in Canada for the elder Sambra has also been an adventure.
After learning to write on a computer, he has done substantial work
on a book about Cuba. He also used his e-mail to campaign for the
release of his son.
</P>
<P>
   He was disappointed when Guillermo was not among the first batch
of prisoners to be freed after the pope's visit, but elated to
learn he would be in the second group.
</P>
<P>
   Guillermo and his family spent their first weeks in Canada at a
nonprofit immigration center in West Toronto called Costi, which
arranges government assistance and helps provide food, clothing and
housing subsidies for a year, or until Guillermo finds work. He has
already moved into his own apartment, not far from his father.
</P>
<P>
   Both father and son find it difficult to describe how they feel
about being forced to leave Cuba and take up residence in Canada.
But both are equally struck by what they say are the walls built
around Cuba during the last 40 years that made the rest of the
world seem so forbidding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rights for workers, liberty of expression, social benefits,
free health care, education, children's parks _ all that Fidel
promised was going to happen has happened here in Canada,'' Ismael
Sambra said. ``Once I told a friend in jest, `Hey, this is
communism. This is what they told us it was going to be like in
Cuba.' So for what did we shed so much blood in Cuba? Why did we go
through such anguish?''

ASIA'S ECONOMIC CRISIS COULD IMPACT INTERNATIONAL SECURITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ED OFFLEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Asian economic crisis is complicating an already
difficult juggling act by the U.S. Pacific Command to protect
American security interests while promoting regional stability in
east Asia, experts warned at a Seattle conference Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   While no immediate crisis threatens to escalate into military
hostilities, longstanding tensions between the Koreas, internal
upheavals in Indonesia and economic stagnation in Japan all pose
threats to the U.S. military's policy of constructive engagement
with its counterparts in those countries, a panel of Asian
political analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   And a senior Army general warned the nuclear competition between
India and Pakistan could be a harbinger of increased development of
weapons of mass destruction by regimes throughout the Asia-Pacific
basin.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of armed forces in this area and they have a
lot of nasty weapons,'' Maj. Gen. Stephen Silvasy told a session of
the ``East Asia in Crisis'' conference. Silvasy, deputy commander
of the U.S. Army Pacific command, said the recent round of nuclear
tests in south Asia won't be the last.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where the next nuclear weapons will show up but I
know they will show up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Silvasy noted the multi-service Pacific Command headquartered in
Hawaii controls 330,000 U.S. military personnel, including about
100,000 based in Japan, South Korea and aboard Navy warships. It is
responsible for military operations from the U.S. West Coast to the
east coast of Africa, a vast region spanning 105 million square
miles that contains two-thirds of the world's population, 41
countries and the world's six largest military forces, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The economic downturn in Asia threatens to weaken a number of
U.S.-led programs and diplomatic initiatives in the region that aim
to bolster security, speakers said. They include:
</P>
<P>
   _North Korea's nuclear program: North Korea recently threatened
to walk out on a 1994 agreement in which an international
consortium supported by the United States, Japan and South Korea
agreed to replace Soviet-designed nuclear reactors that generated
bomb-quality warhead material with newer reactors that do not
create plutonium.
</P>
<P>
   _Regional military forces: The collapse of currency values and
budget cuts have halted military modernization efforts and training
exercises with the United States on the part of several counties,
including Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea. Most countries in
the region fear further declines may tempt China in the future to
act unilaterally in several disputed areas such as the oil-rich
Spratley Islands in the South China Sea.
</P>
<P>
   _Support for U.S. forces: Japan and South Korea face financial
pressures that could prompt them to reduce payments for U.S.
military units stationed there, nations, which in turn could lead
for calls in Congress to withdraw U.S. units from east Asia. Japan
currently pays the United States $4 billion annually, about 90
percent of the cost of basing American units there.
</P>
<P>
   Civilian and military speakers agreed the military component of
the Asian situation is intertwined with economic and political
trends.
</P>
<P>
   Silvasy noted that Adm. Joe Prueher, commander-in-chief of
Pacific Command, receives a daily briefing on the Asian financial
markets along with his normal fare of military intelligence and
operational information.
</P>
<P>
   Not all signs are negative, security experts said.
</P>
<P>
   China has in recent years implemented a number of
``confidence-building measures'' to downplay concerns that the
People's Liberation Army is preparing to intervene outside the
mainland, said Sheldon Simon, a security specialist at the Center
for Asian Studies at Arizona State University. While concluding
China is sending mixed signals on military modernization to the
rest of the region, particularly with its 1995 missile tests in the
Taiwan Strait, Beijing has taken several steps to open up its
military exercises to outside observers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The two-day conference was presented by the National Bureau of
Asian Research and the Strategic Studies Institute of the U.S. Army
War College.

BUSH SAYS JASPER `THUGS' NEED TO BE `TREATED LIKE BARBARIANS' 

</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush said Wednesday that the
people who killed a black man in Jasper by dragging him behind a
pickup were guilty of ``barbaric behavior'' and need to be
``treated like barbarians.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he was ``sickened'' by the allegations against three
ex-convicts with suspected ties to racist hate groups. They are
charged with murdering James Byrd Jr., a 49-year-old Jasper man who
did odd jobs and was the father of three.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said the actions of ``three thugs'' shouldn't be
allowed to define Texas. But he said he believed the state has a
problem with race relations because ``there are some people who
have got hate in their hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's disturbing, but government can't make people love one
another,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``When somebody steps across the bounds, and does what happened
in Jasper, what government can do is provide a cell for a long
period of time, a courtroom with good prosecutors, and that's
what's going to happen in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor wouldn't say whether laws against ``hate crimes''
should be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that all crime is hate, particularly the crime that
went on there,'' he said. ``I think the way to get rid of hate in
people's hearts, the best course I know is religion .... The truth
of the matter is hate and evil exist, and something much larger
than government will help (heal) the hearts of man.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush called on the courts to respond quickly to the murder but
said he didn't plan to go to Jasper, a town of 8,000 about 150
miles northeast of Houston. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``I think the best thing I can do is tell the revulsion I felt
in my gut when I saw what happened,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two state lawmakers who represent Jasper said they were appalled
at the murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nature of this crime is despicable and worthy of great
outrage,'' said state Sen. Drew Nixon, R-Carthage, and state Rep.
Wayne Christian, R-Center, in a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through our criminal justice system, East Texans will show the
nation that we will not tolerate acts of racial malice.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislators urged people to ``remain calm and allow the
system a chance to work.''

 &HT;    
 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    On Wednesday, Southern Baptists dominated our morning
conversation over coffee and the newspaper. ``Guess what?'' said my
husband, ``The Southern Baptists passed the resolution saying wives
must submit to their husbands.''
 &HT;    ``Wifely submission?'' I responded, ``Why not slaves? Why don't
they hold slaves, too?''
 &HT;    ``They would if they could. It's not legal. Remember? We fought
a war over that.''
 &HT;    This week, the Southern Baptist Convention amended Baptist Faith
and Message, the denomination's doctrinal summary, to include a
statement asserting male headship and female submission as the
model for Christian marriage.
 &HT;    Mary Mohler, a member of the family committee and wife of a
prominent Southern Baptist seminary president, defended the
amendment saying, ``Submission is not a negative word. It's not a
politically correct word. It is a biblically correct word.''
 &HT;    Although based on 42 biblical texts, the addition draws heavily
from Paul's letter to the Ephesians. In chapter five, the author
outlines his theology of marriage: wives must ``be subject'' to
their husbands as to God; husbands must ``love your wives as Christ
loved the church''; children must obey their parents. The new
statement follows the Pauline text almost exactly.
 &HT;    Almost. But not quite.
 &HT;    The Baptist statement stops with Paul's instructions for
children in Ephesians 6:4. The passage, however, continues with the
next verse, ``Slaves, be obedient to those who are your masters.''
 &HT;    Yes, Mrs. Mohler, wifely submission is ``biblically correct.''
So is slavery. The Bible teaches them in the same text. Why believe
one and not the other?
 &HT;    Despite my husband's quip, most Southern Baptists do not believe
in slavery and would surely be offended by the suggestion that they
do. But why not? Widely practiced in the ancient world, biblical
texts seem to support slavery. With only minor exceptions, the
Bible points to an overwhelming conclusion: slavery should be
regulated, but not necessarily abolished, in Christian societies.
 &HT;    Until the nineteenth century, Christians used the Bible to
justify slavery arguing that the practice was not inherently
sinful. According to scripture, even the most faithful believers
could be good masters.
 &HT;    Today, however, few Southern Baptists would admit slaveholding
is good. Like most people, they believe slavery was wrong --
perhaps even evil or sinful.
 &HT;    Instead, contemporary Christians argue that the Bible does not
promote slavery. Rather, the Bible only sanctioned slavery as a
cultural practice and attempted to control its excesses. Able to
differentiate between timeless moral teaching and cultural
temporalities, Christians -- Southern Baptists and other
conservatives included -- reject slavery in spite of apparent
biblical injunctions to the contrary.
 &HT;    When it comes to women, however, conservative Christians have
drawn the line. Male headship and wifely submission are not
cultural -- they are eternal biblical standards. If one violates
these spiritual principles, it is tantamount to apostasy and
threatens the moral stability of church and nation.
 &HT;    As with slavery, however, wifely submission was an ancient
cultural norm. Rome was a rigidly structured patriarchal society.
Authority flowed through the ``pater familias,'' the male head of
household, to all those who depended upon his protection. Roman
wives had few rights; children and slaves, none.
 &HT;    Early Christianity challenged Roman authority. Women and slaves
converted to the new faith in greater numbers than did the male
overlords. Rather than following their masters' old religions, the
converts embraced Jesus's teaching.
 &HT;    The new Christians disobeyed old authorities in order to be
baptized, to teach their children faith, and to attend worship.
When the Romans complained that Christianity was ``a religion of
women and slaves,'' they were warning the new faith undermined
social order -- especially the traditional family.
 &HT;    When Paul urged wives to submit, he was trying to control a
chaotic -- and potentially dangerous -- situation. Because it
threatened the family, the new church might be persecuted.
Exuberant converts needed to temper their faith with a respect for
traditional structure. Therefore, Paul urged wifely submission as a
way to prove their fidelity to Roman society and mitigate the
charge of treason to the Empire.
 &HT;    Ephesians 5 is not timeless morality. Rather, it reflects

 &HT;    
 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    On Wednesday, Southern Baptists dominated our morning
conversation over coffee and the newspaper. ``Guess what?'' said my
husband, ``The Southern Baptists passed the resolution saying wives
must submit to their husbands.''
 &HT;    ``Wifely submission?'' I responded, ``Why not slaves? Why don't
they hold slaves, too?''
 &HT;    ``They would if they could. It's not legal. Remember? We fought
a war over that.''
 &HT;    This week, the Southern Baptist Convention amended Baptist Faith
and Message, the denomination's doctrinal summary, to include a
statement asserting male headship and female submission as the
model for Christian marriage.
 &HT;    Mary Mohler, a member of the family committee and wife of a
prominent Southern Baptist seminary president, defended the
amendment saying, ``Submission is not a negative word. It's not a
politically correct word. It is a biblically correct word.''
 &HT;    Although based on 42 biblical texts, the addition draws heavily
from Paul's letter to the Ephesians. In chapter five, the author
outlines his theology of marriage: wives must ``be subject'' to
their husbands as to God; husbands must ``love your wives as Christ
loved the church''; children must obey their parents. The new
statement follows the Pauline text almost exactly.
 &HT;    Almost. But not quite.
 &HT;    The Baptist statement stops with Paul's instructions for
children in Ephesians 6:4. The passage, however, continues with the
next verse, ``Slaves, be obedient to those who are your masters.''
 &HT;    Yes, Mrs. Mohler, wifely submission is ``biblically correct.''
So is slavery. The Bible teaches them in the same text. Why believe
one and not the other?
 &HT;    Despite my husband's quip, most Southern Baptists do not believe
in slavery and would surely be offended by the suggestion that they
do. But why not? Widely practiced in the ancient world, biblical
texts seem to support slavery. With only minor exceptions, the
Bible points to an overwhelming conclusion: slavery should be
regulated, but not necessarily abolished, in Christian societies.
 &HT;    Until the nineteenth century, Christians used the Bible to
justify slavery arguing that the practice was not inherently
sinful. According to scripture, even the most faithful believers
could be good masters.
 &HT;    Today, however, few Southern Baptists would admit slaveholding
is good. Like most people, they believe slavery was wrong --
perhaps even evil or sinful.
 &HT;    Instead, contemporary Christians argue that the Bible does not
promote slavery. Rather, the Bible only sanctioned slavery as a
cultural practice and attempted to control its excesses. Able to
differentiate between timeless moral teaching and cultural
temporalities, Christians -- Southern Baptists and other
conservatives included -- reject slavery in spite of apparent
biblical injunctions to the contrary.
 &HT;    When it comes to women, however, conservative Christians have
drawn the line. Male headship and wifely submission are not
cultural -- they are eternal biblical standards. If one violates
these spiritual principles, it is tantamount to apostasy and
threatens the moral stability of church and nation.
 &HT;    As with slavery, however, wifely submission was an ancient
cultural norm. Rome was a rigidly structured patriarchal society.
Authority flowed through the ``pater familias,'' the male head of
household, to all those who depended upon his protection. Roman
wives had few rights; children and slaves, none.
 &HT;    Early Christianity challenged Roman authority. Women and slaves
converted to the new faith in greater numbers than did the male
overlords. Rather than following their masters' old religions, the
converts embraced Jesus's teaching.
 &HT;    The new Christians disobeyed old authorities in order to be
baptized, to teach their children faith, and to attend worship.
When the Romans complained that Christianity was ``a religion of
women and slaves,'' they were warning the new faith undermined
social order -- especially the traditional family.
 &HT;    When Paul urged wives to submit, he was trying to control a
chaotic -- and potentially dangerous -- situation. Because it
threatened the family, the new church might be persecuted.
Exuberant converts needed to temper their faith with a respect for
traditional structure. Therefore, Paul urged wifely submission as a
way to prove their fidelity to Roman society and mitigate the
charge of treason to the Empire.
 &HT;    Ephesians 5 is not timeless morality. Rather, it reflects
particular problems faced by early Christians in the cultural
context of ancient Rome.
 &HT;    The ``biblical'' family -- now enshrined by Southern Baptists --
is not biblical at all. Pagans practiced male headship; early
Christians rejected it. They experienced a God who lifts the
oppressed from their humble estate.
 &HT;    The Christian family consists neither of roles nor structures.
Rather, it is a living community which embodies Jesus' teaching:
Love God and love thy neighbor as thyself.
 &HT;    Accordingly, my family is my closest neighbor; from this
intimate neighborhood, each member moves out into the world and
serves others in a life of faithful vocation. We do not lead,
submit, and obey; we love, respect, and support one another.
 &HT;    I'm sorry if that isn't Christian enough for the Southern
Baptists.

     SUMMER LUCH PROGRAM FAILING TO REACH MAY
POOR CHILDREN
 &HT;     By KIMBERLY MARSELAS 
 &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite an increase in the number of summer free
lunch programs offered across Texas and the nation, too many
children are still going hungry during the summer months, the Food
Research and Action Center reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the summer food program reached all eligible children,
millions less would go hungry,'' said Jim Weill, the president of
FRAC, a national anti-hunger group. The report, `Hunger Doesn't
Take a Vacation,'' found that many families are unaware that the
federally funded free lunch program even exists during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Only 16 percent, or about 2.3 million, of the 14.7 million
school children nationwide who participate in the free or
reduced-cost lunch programs during the school year take advantage
of similar summer programs. There were 28,387 food program sites
for children last summer, up 1,239 from the summer of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government gives subsidies to qualified sponsors,
including schools, churches and other non-profit groups, to provide
food for low-income children during school vacations. But the
report's author, Michele Tingling-Clemmons, said the local sponsors
usually do not generate enough publicity about summer free lunch
programs in their areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The program is not well-advertised,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Tingling-Clemmons praised the ``Lunch's On Us!'' program in
Corpus Christi, Texas, for its outreach and promotional campaign,
which includes announcements and interviews on television and radio
talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parks and recreation department has done a mammoth job
there,'' she said. FRAC, a national anti-hunger group, named Corpus
Christi one of its eight model programs for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But Tingling-Clemmons said many children still don't participate
in free lunch programs during the summer because of transportation
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even more than during the school year, children eligible to
receive free meals during the summer often have no transportation
to meal sites, and sponsors cannot afford to staff widely scattered
rural sites that have few participants,'' the FRAC report found.
</P>
<P>
   This problem was handled by another of FRAC's model programs in
Hookstown, Pa., a rural area with several mobile home parks. The
South Side School District there converted a school bus into a
cafeteria on wheels and now delivers more than 300 children's
lunches a day during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   FRAC officials said they were encouraged by increases in the
number of children served, the number of sites serving lunches and
the initiative of local sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when Congress is contributing to cuts, people at the
local level are struggling to make these programs expand,'' said
Weill. The FRAC president blamed recent food stamp and welfare
legislation for an increase in hungry children.
</P>
<P>
   But the report shows there is still room for improvement. ``All
states can do better, and that fact is shown by the diversity of
states in this report that are doing better,'' said Weill.
Twenty-nine states and the District of Columbia served more
children in the summer of 1997 than in the previous summer.

   &UR; (Editors: A COLOR SLIDE of Belleruth Naparstek is available.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By CHERYL HECKLER-FELTZ &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Psychotherapist Belleruth Naparstek recalled the patient who
visited her in her Cleveland office more than 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The woman was dying of cancer, had been told she could not
survive more than six months and was demanding help.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had horrific cancer and her oncologist said to me, 'Just
do what you can. You can't make her medical circumstances any
worse.'''
</P>
<P>
   The woman was ``tough, committed and determined to stay alive,''
Naparstek said. ``She was very bossy, very demanding and very
appealing.''
</P>
<P>
   Naparstek, who had begun to conduct guided imagery exercises for
patients during therapy sessions to promote their relaxation and
enhance their coping skills, agreed to make a cassette tape of
guided imagery for the patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recorded it at my kitchen table. I included her favorite
images and added some background music,'' Naparstek said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She lived another 2 1/2 years and had a good quality of
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Naparstek has since become known nationally for her ``Health
Journey'' series of guided-imagery audio tapes, which she describes
as ``a kind of deliberate, directed daydreaming.''
</P>
<P>
   Guided imagery leans heavily on sensory imagination and emotion
as a way of creating images in the mind to heal or relax the body.
It is the power of visualization, the power of mind over matter _
and it is nothing new.
</P>
<P>
   For years, professional athletes have used it to see victory on
the playing field, surgeons to envision successful procedures,
stock brokers to imagine a system of success in the midst of the
chaotic trading floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The body, if you run images _ richly sensory images _ in an
altered state, will take those images as real,'' she said. ``It is
a way of programming the body.''
</P>
<P>
   There is growing evidence that guided imagery in general _ and
Naparstek in particular _ are dramatically improving many lives:
</P>
<P>
   _Naparstek, 54, has sold about 400,000 copies of her 20 guided
imagery audio tapes, helping patients deal with addictions,
diabetes, weight problems, asthma, AIDS and other health issues.
</P>
<P>
   _SmithKline Beecham recently purchased 200,000 copies of her
chemotherapy tape for distribution to cancer patients.
</P>
<P>
   _Naparstek's tapes are now used at more than 800 hospitals and
health institutions _ from the Mayo Clinic and Cleveland Clinic
Cancer Center to Columbia Presbyterian in New York and UCLA Medical
Center in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   _In a three-year study of 335 surgical patients done at the
Medical Center at the University of California at Davis,
researchers found that patients who listened to Naparstek's guided
imagery tapes prior to and during surgery lost less blood, had a
shorter hospital stay and required less pain medication than
patients who listened to four other kinds of tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Patients listened to the Health Journeys tape repeatedly before
surgery; then during surgery, tapes of just the background music
were played, triggering in a patient's subconscious mind the
message that had been heard so many times before.
</P>
<P>
   The study involved four other types of tapes: one of
affirmations (positive thoughts), one of explanatory reassurance
and one of white noise and one called a ``brain wave'' tape,
designed to synchronize both sides of the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Naparstek refuses to claim that guided imagery is the panacea
for all illnesses. ``I get very impatient with people who claim
that their one thing fixes everything. What I can say about my
tapes is this: They sure don't hurt you. At the very least they
help with coping. At best, they do seem to help the healing process
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after she made the first cancer tape, nurses at the
Ireland Cancer Center at University Hospitals in Cleveland asked
her to make a tape that chemotherapy patients could listen to while
waiting for their treatments.
</P>
<P>
   The success of that tape made her decide to create and mass
market tapes dealing with a variety of medical conditions. By 1991,
she had 14 titles and a contract with Time Warner Audio Books.
</P>
<P>
   She researches each disease thoroughly and then determines which
physical images will be most helpful to people with that particular
disease. She then records a tape describing those images.
</P>
<P>
   In the tape focused on weight loss, for instance, she tells
listeners to sense a light moving into the thyroid and pituitary
glands, speeding up their body's metabolism like moving a lever on
a carburetor.
</P>
<P>
   Her interest in the power of imagination has deep roots. ``As a
child, I was a left-handed space case,'' she said, ``always
imagining and acting things out in my head.'' Left-handedness is an
indication of right brain dominance, which means greater tendency
toward creative expression.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started using imagery for clients who were stuck in the
therapy process _ who needed to get around left-brained (more
analytical than creative) processes.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually she made personalized tapes for several clients based
on their own needs. ``I had them picture themselves achieving
specific goals I knew they were working towards or see themselves
in the best possible light.''
</P>
<P>
   Naparstek has written two books, ``Staying Well With Guided
Imagery'' published by Warner and ``Your Sixth Sense: Activating
Your Psychic Potential'' published by HarperSan Francisco.

GEN-CSUN (Los Angeles) _ First of a two-day package. One year ago,
Cal State Northridge announced it was addressing a budgetary
shortfall and meeting an agreement for gender equity by eliminating
four men's sports _ baseball, volleyball, swimming and soccer. The
administration expected a short, muted protest. However, the
community howled. All four sports were eventually reinstated,
through at least the next academic year, and president Blenda
Wilson has committed to keeping them forever. A look at where the
programs stand now, how last year's fiasco affected the athletic
program, a look at this year's much improved budget situation,
NOW's position that the consent decree won't be renegotiated until
at least 1999, what the task force accomplished, at the student's

   TOBACCO-LOTT (Washington) _ When the anti-smoking issue came

His brother-in-law Richard Scruggs was one of the lawyers who had
negotiated the tobacco settlement and stood to make millions from
any legislation. So the Senate majority leader turned the issue
over to his majority whip, and to this day he carefully votes
present on any amendments that might affect the attorney's fees to
come out of the deal. But he has now emerged as one of the critical
players who will determine the fate of anti-tobacco legislation
this year. So some days he proclaims the tobacco legislation near
death. On others, he smoothes the way for conservatives to add tax
cuts and anti-drug amendments that could help them swallow the
bill. By Alison Mitchell. With photo.

<P>
   Last month a deeply troubled 15-year-old took a semiautomatic
rifle and pistols to school, fired 51 rounds in a Springfield,
Ore., high school cafeteria, killing two students and wounding 18
others. He had murdered his parents as well.
</P>
<P>
   The scenario was disturbingly similar to other small-town
America juvenile slaughters:
</P>
<P>
   In Pearl, Miss., a 16-year-old killed his mother and father and
two classmates.
</P>
<P>
   A 14-year-old shot three girls in a West Paducah (Ky.) high
school with a semiautomatic.
</P>
<P>
   In Jonesboro, Ark., an 11-year-old and 13-year-old ambushed
classmates, killing five.
</P>
<P>
   Yet nationally, murder rates dropped 20 percent from 1993 to
1996, and fell another 9 percent last year. New York's murder rate
fell 22 percent, and Los Angeles was down 20 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, something is poisoning the youth of America that has
eluded adults.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, guns are too available, with 222 million of them in
America. In a recent year 38,166 Americans died by gunshot while
the comparable number in Great Britain was under 100.
</P>
<P>
   But the guns are already out there, and fewer adults are being
murdered, while in a six-year period, arrests for murder of those
aged 18 to 20 leapt 113 percent; for 17-year-olds it jumped 121
percent; for 16-year-olds, 158 percent and among 15-year-olds, 217
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The odds that a boy born in America in 1974 will be murdered
are higher than the odds that serviceman in World War II would be
killed in combat,'' says Sen. Phil Gramm.
</P>
<P>
   One solution proposed by Handgun Control Inc. makes sense: a
Children's Access Prevention law. It holds parents accountable if
they allow guns to fall into underage hands. Florida passed the
first CAP law in 1989, and 14 other states have done so.
</P>
<P>
   Result: unintentional deaths dropped 23 percent among children
younger than 15. Sen. Richard Durbin of Illinois, who is
introducing a federal CAP bill, says: ``It's time for the adults
who own the guns to act responsibly, to store them safely and to
take responsibility for guns in their possession.''
</P>
<P>
   However, there is a more sinister, insidious poison affecting
the minds of youth: nihilistic violence-inciting television.
</P>
<P>
   Have you heard of the TV show ``South Park?'' Probably not. Ask
any 8- to 12-year-old, you will get an earful. It is a cartoon
featuring four 8-year-olds in an elementary school who have foul
mouths and a love of mayhem that is aired on the cable network,
Comedy Central, at 10 p.m. Wednesdays. It is hot, generating more
ad income than any other cable show.
</P>
<P>
   In EVERY episode, one of the characters, Kenny, is murdered. He
is shot, run over, stabbed and even decapitated. Each time, the
other kids say: ``Oh my God, they killed Kenny. You bastard.'' But
they say it nonchalantly. After one killing, another character
says, ``Everybody has somebody they want to be killed.'' This is
supposed to be funny.
</P>
<P>
   Why is Kenny killed each week? Matt Stone, co-creator of the
series with Trey Parker, explains: ``Trey and I created Kenny. So
we can kill him.. Leave us alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Each show is also sexually shocking. ``An Elephant Makes Love To
A Pig'' is the title of one episode. ``I will produce a pot-bellied
elephant,'' says an 8-year-old competing in a science project. When
the animals show no sexual interest, they ask an adult what to do.
``Get them good and drunk,'' they are advised.
</P>
<P>
   When that fails, the school janitor, who sings raunchy songs
each week, advises they need music for atmosphere, and croons,
``Tonight is right for love. You know I want to touch you when the
lights go out. Love, baby. Love so sweet. I want your love. You are
burning like a dog in heat.'' That worked.
</P>
<P>
   The show's violence has had a proven devastating consequence.
Anita Ferguson of the Maryland Times Press reported last week that
a 12-year-old in Ocean City, Md. who committed suicide, left a note
telling his parents to watch ``South Park'' to learn why he killed
himself. He mentioned Kenny, the silent third grader murdered in
every episode.
</P>
<P>
   ``Media influence on our youth can not be underestimated,'' says
Melody Morris, director of the Christian Family Network in Dayton.
``The violence we see coming from young people is a mirror image of
what is being portrayed in so-called entertainment fields.''
</P>
<P>
   What can be done? Write your cable company demanding ``South
Park'' be removed. And write to the advertisers:

serious blow to Washington wheat farmers, advising the White House
that under a sanctions law, Pakistan must be barred from accessing
the credits it has used to purchase up to 40 percent of

   ENDANGERED-SPECIES (Undated) The Clinton Administration's

Endangered Species Act on millions of acres of private lands across
the United States has relied upon shaky science, a new study has
found.The draft study, performed by 119 independent scientists with
National Science Foundation funding, highlights scientific
weaknesses in Habitat Conservation Plans, which the administration
has used to enforce the ESA. The plans, or HCPs, are negotiated
agreements that allow landowners to destroy habitat and even kill
imperilled species _ by logging or home-building for instance _ in

Jackson first. If that doesn't happen, then they probably will name

anyone of the candidates is a front runner is inaccurate.'' Says
the process will go well into next week. Jackson's agent says there
has been no formal contact by the Sonics, but if there is an

DEFENDING CHAMPION BRAZIL STRUGGLES IN CUP OPENER, A 2-1 WIN OVER
SCOTLAND  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Updates to include score on Norway-Morocco game)   By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. DENIS, France _ Brazil's coach, Mario Zagallo, said he would
know in the first match whether he had great players or a great
team. The fans had already made up their mind. When Zagallo was
introduced Wednesday, he was booed. But his team did what a
defending champion must do in the opener of the World Cup. It
survived, even if it took Scotland putting a goal into its own net
to provide a 2-1 victory for Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   There is a certain fatalism about this team, which Brazil's fans
and media have accused of abandoning ``the beautiful game'' for
defense and individualism. And there is always tremendous
expectation and pressure on a defending champion in the opening of
the World Cup, especially when that champion is Brazil, where the
passion for the game is overwhelming and perhaps irrational.
</P>
<P>
   So, few people will be satisfied with Wednesday's outcome, but
that is beside the point. Brazil won its first match, which
Argentina could not do against Cameroon in 1990 and which Germany
struggled to accomplish against Bolivia in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   With 3 points in the standings, Brazil can now relax for a few
days and perhaps even look ahead to the next round after upcoming
group matches against Morocco and Norway. Morocco and Norway met in
the second game Wednesday, in Montpellier, with the match ending in
a 2-2 tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very difficult but a big satisfaction,'' said Zagallo,
66, who has been a coach or player on all four of Brazil's World
Cup championship teams. ``This was very important win because it
was the first match of the World Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   The deciding goal came in the 73d minute, three minutes after
Zagallo had benched his subdued forward, Bebeto, and enlivened his
team with the open play of Denilson.
</P>
<P>
   Cafu, the Brazilian defender, slashed into the penalty area and
Dunga chipped a perfect pass to his feet. Cafu tried to lift the
ball over the Scottish goalkeeper, Jim Leighton, who at 40 is the
oldest player in the tournament, but the ball bounced off
Leighton's face toward his teammate Tommy Boyd. Scrambling to help,
Boyd could not prevent the rebound from bouncing off his shoulder
into the goal. Incredulous, and a little lucky, Cafu did a flip in
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's first goal, in the fifth minute, was also unorthodox.
Bebeto aimed a corner kick toward the goal and midfielder Cesar
Sampaio timed his jump, only to have Scotland's Craig Burley put a
hand on his shoulder and shove him in the back. Sampaio was thrown
off slightly, but the ball richocheted off his right shoulder past
a stunned Leighton.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no denying the better team won, but we had a great
chance not to lose,'' said Craig Brown, Scotland's coach. ``We gave
away two very bad goals from a technical point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   Scotland had positioned itself for a welcomed 1-1 tie after
Sampaio committed a foolish foul on Scottish striker Kevin
Gallacher in the 38th minute, shoving him down in the penalty area
and drawing a yellow card. John Collins took the penalty kick and
slammed a low blast inside the left post, past the dive of
Taffarel, the Brazilian goalkeeper.
</P>
<P>
   Brown sandwiched seven players into the penalty box area in the
second half, determined not to give Ronaldo any room to operate.
Not that he needed any. The 21-year-old Brazilian forward is
considered the world's best player and his talents _ at least all
but goal scoring _ were on full display Wednesday. Every time he
touched the ball or raced toward the goal, the 80,000-seat Stade de
France throbbed with anticipation.
</P>
<P>
   Ronaldo did not disappoint here in the northern Paris suburbs.
In the first half, he dribbled his way through three Scottish
defenders in the penalty area, like a slalom skier going through
gates, and fired a wicked line drive that Leighton saved with a
desperate lunge.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The game was flawed but always entertaining, as was the
beautifully inscrutable opening ceremony that has become de rigeur
for the French since the Fellini-esque opening to the 1992 Winter
Olympics in Albertville, France. Ladybugs entered on stilts and
bounded on trampolines while giant flowers budded from a canvas
lawn in what appeared to be the world's most extravagant tribute to
cross-pollination. Trapeze artists rapelled from the roof of the
futuristic stadium, bearing flags of the 32 teams competing in the
World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, Brazilian fans in their gold and green shirts, and
Scottish fans in their tartan kilts and red wigs, mingled
peacefully before the match; if there was no common language,
alcohol provided a common purpose. Jimmy McKay, an actuary from
Chicago, said his wife let him travel to Europe once a year to
watch Scotland play soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a condition of our marriage,'' McKay said. ``She's from
Kentucky. She doesn't like football. She doesn't like the state I
get into, the state of alcoholic refreshment.''
</P>
<P>
   Said John Irvine of Glasgow: ``If we win, the Eiffel Tower will
be wearing a kilt.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazil fans seemed to think that, no matter Wednesday's outcome,
this team would not repeat as World Cup champions. ``They don't
play Brazil's kind of football,'' said Helio Souza of Sao Paulo,
where the Stock Exchange was closed for Wednesday match. ``Zagallo
likes defense too much. He doesn't take risks.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be much debate about who should start at forward next
against Morocco _ the ineffective Bebeto, the magical Denilson or
the volatile Edmundo. But that is a turmoil for another day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy to have a win,'' Ronaldo said. ``The first match is
always the most difficult.''

MARSHALL GREEN, 82, DIPLOMAT AND EXPERT ON EAST ASIA
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By PHILIP SHENON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Marshall Green, who for years was the State
Department's leading expert on East Asia and served as ambassador
to Indonesia during the violent uprising in the 1960s that brought
President Suharto to power there, died on Saturday near his home in
Washington. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
   His family said he suffered a heart attack while playing golf
with one of his sons. He was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital.
</P>
<P>
   At the side of a succession of presidents and secretaries of
state, Green helped steer American foreign policy in East Asia as
the United States deepened its involvement in the region in the
decades after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   He was a witness to history in Asia from the earliest days of
his career, which began with his appointment in 1939 as the private
secretary to the U.S. ambassador to Tokyo. He left the embassy only
a few months before Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961, he was the senior American diplomat in South Korea
during a coup that toppled a democratically elected government.
Four years later, he was ambassador to Indonesia during the
overthrow of President Sukarno and his replacement by Suharto. In
1969, he was named a member of the U.S. delegation to negotiations
in Paris to end the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, he was a key aide to secretary of state Henry
Kissinger and accompanied President Richard Nixon on his historic
1972 visit to China. After the China trip, Nixon sent Green to
several Asian nations to calm their fears about the new
relationship between Washington and Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ``History is likely to regard the period from 1940 to about 1970
as the golden age of the American Foreign Service,'' said William
Bundy, who preceded Green as assistant secretary of state for East
Asian and Pacific affairs and went on to edit Foreign Affairs
magazine. ``No career officer exemplifies that period and its ethos
better than Marshall Green.''
</P>
<P>
   Green was born in Holyoke, Mass., on Jan. 27, 1916, and
graduated from Yale University in 1939. His introduction to Asia
came later that year, with his appointment as secretary to
Ambassador Joseph Clark Grew in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the attack on Pearl Harbor, Green returned to the
United States to prepare to take the examination for the Foreign
Service. With the start of the war in the Pacific, he joined the
Navy as a Japanese-language translator. He had learned to speak
Japanese during his years in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   After his discharge from the Navy in 1945, he joined the Foreign
Service and received his first assignment _ third secretary in
Wellington, New Zealand, where he remained for two years.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout a career that spanned five decades, Green was admired
by his State Department colleagues for his persuasive speaking
style, his almost preternatural calm and his quick wit.
</P>
<P>
   He endeared himself to many fellow American diplomats _ although
not to Kissinger _ when he let slip in a speech that the former
secretary of state was a ``self-made man who worshipped his
creator.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   His cool head served him well as he managed the American
response to a series of diplomatic and military crises in East
Asia, beginning with the 1958 crisis over the Chinese Communist
shelling of Quemoy and Matsu, two offshore islands held by the
Chinese Nationalists on Taiwan. The clash brought the United States
and China to the brink of war.
</P>
<P>
   Bundy later said that Green, who was the State Department's
chief working-level officer on the issue, ``argued at the moment of
greatest apparent crisis that China was in fact easing off, and
that a policy of quiet firmness would win out and bring the threat
to an end without outright war _ he was right.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1961, Green was the senior American diplomat in Seoul, South
Korea, when Gen. Park Chung Hee seized power in a military coup
that ousted an elected government. As soon as he learned of the
coup, Green announced on local radio that the United States
continued to back the ousted civilian government, a decision that
did not endear him to the Korean military.
</P>
<P>
   He was named ambassador to Indonesia in July 1965, only weeks
ahead of an anti-Communist purge there that would see Sukarno
replaced with Suharto and would lead to the deaths of an estimated
500,000 Indonesian leftists.
</P>
<P>
   To make clear the tensions between Indonesia and the United
States at the time of Green's appointment _ the Indonesians were
opposed to American military involvement in Vietnam _ Sukarno
organized a ``Go Home, Green'' protest by thousands of Indonesian
demonstrators outside of the ambassador's residence, only hours
after Green presented his credentials to the Indonesian leader.
</P>
<P>
   Green, who was widely praised within the State Department for
his bravery during the months of bloodshed that followed the ouster
of Sukarno, practiced what he described as a ``low-profile
concept'' of diplomacy during his years in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   From 1969 to 1973, at the height of the Vietnam War, Green
served in Washington as the assistant secretary for East Asian and
Pacific affairs, a post in which he helped oversee foreign policy
in all of the Far East, including Indochina.
</P>
<P>
   His office did much of the background work in preparation for
Nixon's visit to China, and he was one of the 13 senior American
officials who accompanied the president to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   From 1973 to 1975, Green was ambassador to Australia. He
returned from Australia to become the State Department's
coordinator of population affairs. He retired in 1979 and went on
to write three books, all of them touching on his experiences in
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Legend had it that upon his arrival in the Tokyo Embassy in 1939
as the secretary to the ambassador, Green saw the portrait of a
young woman named Lispenard Seabury Crocker on the mantlepiece of
the home of her father, a senior diplomat in the embassy, and
announced that he would marry her.
</P>
<P>
   In 1942, he did. The couple had three children, two of whom
survive Green _ Mark Green and Edward Green, both of Washington.
Mrs. Green died in 1986. Their other son, Brampton, died in 1988.

CLINTON URGES STRONGER LEGISLATION ON EQUAL PAY FOR WOMEN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Another day, another 75 cents _ if you're a woman.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said Wednesday it's not good enough that the
wage gap between men and women has narrowed. He called on Congress
to act quickly to pass legislation giving women the ability to
punish companies that allow pay disparity to continue.
</P>
<P>
   The White House staged a full-scale event _ complete with the
president, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, Vice President Al
Gore and wife Tipper Gore, civil rights leaders and members of
Congress _ to press the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The administration released two reports to mark the 35th
anniversary of the Equal Pay Act signed by President Kennedy in
1963. The reports show the pay differential narrowed from 58 cents
earned by women to every $1 earned by a man to 75 cents earned by a
woman to every $1 for a man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you will be persuaded that there is no explanation for
the gap that is complete without acknowledging the continued
existence of discrimination,'' Clinton said after reviewing the
reports.
</P>
<P>
   The president called for Republican leaders in Congress to
immediately schedule a vote on a measure by Democrats that would
allow women to sue for compensatory and punitive damages rather
than being limited to regaining back pay as they are under current
law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, this should not be a partisan political issue. In a funny
way, it shouldn't even be a gender issue. More fundamentally, it is
a civil rights issue. More fundamentally than that, it is a family
issue,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The event on equal pay was one of a series the White House has
organized in recent weeks to focus on issues especially important
to women, such as reining in managed health care or curbing tobacco
use among children. Women are key constituents for Democrats going
into the congressional elections this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It always seems the White House is aiming at women one way or
another,'' said Michael Scanlon, spokesman for House Majority Whip
Tom DeLay, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is driving the White House is politics. That's how he ran
his last campaign. He wanted to court the women's vote and he wants
to do that again,'' Scanlon said. ``One questions whether he's
really concerned about this issue or whether he's trying to drive
up his poll ratings among women.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he knew of no plans for the House to vote on the
Democratic measure but ``that's not to say it won't become an
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton said what's at stake is equity under the
Constitution and what kind of nation the United States wants to be
in the new century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Therefore, it is ludicrous to say that 75 percent equality is
enough. You wouldn't tolerate getting to vote in three out of every
four elections,'' Clinton said. ``I wouldn't like it if someone
said you can only pick up three out of every four paychecks. But
that is, in effect, what we have said to the women of America.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation also would allow women employees to share their
salary information with each other without reprisal from the
company and require companies with more than 100 employees to
report in general terms their pay scales for women and men.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., a sponsor of the legislation,
suggested Congress should increase the minimum wage because that
would help narrow the pay gap. He noted women account for 60
percent of the minimum wage earners. &QL;

 &HT;    COMPROMISE REACHED ON TAX-FREE ACCOUNTS FOR EDUCATION SPENDING
 &HT;    Not for Atlanta
 &HT;    By KEN FOSKETT
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress is heading toward a showdown with
President Clinton over federal education policy.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate Republicans, joined by several key Democrats,
announced agreement Wednesday on a compromise proposal by Sens.
Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., and Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., to establish
tax-free savings accounts for children in elementary and secondary
school.
</P>
<P>
   The House will vote on final passage next Wednesday, with a
Senate vote likely soon thereafter. Clinton has vowed repeatedly to
veto the measure, which would allow parents, relatives and even
corporate or union sponsors to set aside up to $2,000 annually in
tax-free savings accounts. Money in the accounts could be used for
private school tuition, after-school tutors and expensive school
supplies such as computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, the president's veto still stands,'' said White
House spokeswoman Julia Payne.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, however, crafted a compromise that will put
pressure on Clinton to sign the bill. At the request of a
half-dozen Democrats, Republican leaders agreed to strip the
legislation of two controversial provisions that were tacked on
when the bill was first voted on by the Senate two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation agreed to by the House-Senate conference
committee does not contain a provision by Sen. Slade Gorton,
R-Wash., to allow states and communities to receive federal
education money in the form of block grants. It also does not
contain an amendment by Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo., that would have
hampered Clinton's efforts to establish voluntary testing for
fourth- and eighth-graders _ though Ashcroft received written
commitments from Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and
House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., that his proposal would be
included in other legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats vowed to filibuster the conference committee bill if
it included the Ashcroft and Gorton provisions, and the removal of
the controversial measures assures easy passage in both the House
and the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., said the bill now embodies
``classic new Democrat'' ideals that Clinton champions, offering a
way to empower parents without costing any government money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The removal of these amendments are a step toward the
president,'' Lieberman said. ``It opens the opportunity for him to
take a step toward the bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Max Cleland, D-Ga., Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., John
Breaux, D-La., Bob Graham, D-Fla., and Joe Biden, D-Del., also
threw their support behind the legislation, minus the block grant
and school testing amendments.
</P>
<P>
   Not all Democrats were hailing the measure as a testament to
bipartisan cooperation. Jim Manley, spokesman for Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass., said Democrats were effectively excluded from the
conference committee deliberations, saying Kennedy received only
three hours' notice about a meeting held last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats were shut out,'' Manley said. ``It will get the veto
that it richly deserves.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will also have to choose whether he wants to support
reading programs in the legislation. Congress appropriated $210
million for reading programs, but the money can't be spent unless
Congress also adopts authorizing legislation by July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell's bill now includes the authorizing legislation for
the money to be spent on teacher training, research and grants to
local school districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that education is a core component of (the president's)
agenda right now, he's got a difficult decision to make,''
Coverdell said.

A TRYING TRIP DOWN MEMORY LANE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH MARTIN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It had become a quest, a search for identity and
the nostalgic longing for an idyllic time in the past all rolled
into one.
</P>
<P>
   As a native of Minnesota, I sought a place to canoe in Southern
California, my home for the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Was it the expression of a midlife crisis? The urge to relive
joyous boyhood hours, many of which were spent in a canoe in the
Land of 10,000 Lakes?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was just the urge to enjoy nature. A canoeist can find
so much serenity on a lake or river that he will never use _ and
hates to hear _ a motor. Paddling gives a sense of gliding, of
floating free amid the bounty of the outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   As a boy, I used to fantasize I was an Indian or an explorer as
I glided through the expansive Boundary Waters Canoe Area along
Minnesota's border with Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't matter that a day trip to Orange County's Irvine Lake
might well pale in comparison to past excursions. Or that the
predominant color in the surrounding hills would be brown, not
green, and the sky would be smudged, not clear. Or that this lake
was a fake _ one of the many reservoirs that dot the arid
Southland.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I tried _ as I so easily did in my youth _ to conjure up
images of Lewis and Clark, paddling their craft silently in virgin
waters.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis and Clark? Try Abbott and Costello. But at least we made a
splash.
</P>
<P>
   My partner Ron Johnson, assistant manager of Irvine Lake, and I
loaded into the canoe clumsily but with hopes high.
</P>
<P>
   ``It must have been 35 years since I've canoed,'' Johnson said,
a note of nostalgia in his voice. It proved an ominous
foreshadowing but went little-noticed at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Our first destination was a scenic cove, where we would land to
snap a few photos. Unfortunately, the only decent spot to land was
occupied by a couple of bass anglers. Does our intrepid party take
the nice path, leaving those guys alone, or the practical one,
paddling to the good spot?
</P>
<P>
   We chose nice. Johnson tried to get out _ splash. He was
drenched, soaked nearly to his chest.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, he remained stoic, in keeping with the day's
regional theme, rather like legendary Minnesota Vikings coach Bud
Grant, who buried dejection with a calm demeanor during the Vikes'
four Super Bowl losses.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, we swapped seats and Johnson took to the stern and
the responsibility of directing the canoe. But, try as he might, he
couldn't keep us going straight. We paddled around in a circle,
much to the amusement of folks at the lake targeting trout on a
derby day. Must have been nice to get a free sideshow while trying
to win cash prizes for the day's biggest catches.
</P>
<P>
   The trip back to the dock took about 20 minutes, and our
courageous party, Lewis and Clark II, found itself amid trees more
than once. Would this require a rescue by a patrol vessel? Has a
canoe ever been evacuated because the stern paddler couldn't paddle
straight?
</P>
<P>
   At the dock, we changed positions again and continued the
sojourn.
</P>
<P>
   What more could possibly go wrong? Life had already served up a
dollop of foul-ups. Surely our quota had been met.
</P>
<P>
   They would be exceeded. After the trip was finished, I
transported the canoe back to the business from which I rented it
only to discover that the life preserver I had also rented was lost
and I was out $50.
</P>
<P>
   Did this ever happen to Lewis and Clark? Don't think so. The
trip was becoming more like a ``Three Stooges'' short. It was time
for Moe to start pulling hair and gouging eyeballs.
</P>
<P>
   But the trip wasn't a complete failure. Once onto the lake,
Lewis and Clark II enacted their dreams of being explorers.
Cormorants, herons, sea gulls and cranes greeted us.
</P>
<P>
   That's one of the great advantages of canoeing. ``In a canoe,
you can slip up on wildlife,'' Johnson said. ``That's the best
feature of it.''
</P>
<P>
   And it was possible to enjoy some solitude... at least when
trolling fishing boats, and gravel-dredging equipment were out of
range. The Marine attack helicopters that hovered overhead were
also a bit unsettling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they're ours,'' Johnson joked, expressing stoic
Minnesota-type resignation to a dark fate.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the interruptions, however, the scenery was pretty good.
Clouds covered 4,000-foot mountains in the Cleveland National
Forest off to the east. The lake was dotted with coves, inlets and
even a few creeks. A canoeist can find plenty of places to track
adventure.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of the voyage covered spots that ordinarily would be dry
land, including many trees that are now under water. The high water
is another effect of El Nino.
</P>
<P>
   The last part of the journey before hugging the shore to the
dock was from Sea Cliffs to Catfish Cove.
</P>
<P>
   The primary fish caught at the cove? Trout.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, why not? It made about as much sense as anything else on a
4-mile trip that may not have evoked many comparisons to long-ago
voyagers who plied the waters of the North Woods but which did
offer one of the Southland's best opportunities for a Minnesotan
hankering for a canoe ride.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Southland is not the Land of 10,000 Lakes, but
it does have its share of locales to enjoy canoeing ... and more
than one might imagine for a desert region.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are places that are jewels even though Southern
California isn't noted for canoeing,'' said Joanne Turner of
Southwind Kayaks in Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   Among the possibilities:
</P>
<P>
   _Naples area of Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   _Upper Newport Bay out of Newport Beach.
</P>
<P>
   _Big Bear Lake (beware of wind).
</P>
<P>
   _Lake Perris near Moreno Valley.
</P>
<P>
   _Lake Elsinore in West Riverside County.
</P>
<P>
   _Lake Hemet in Central Riverside County.
</P>
<P>
   _Colorado River from Hoover Dam to the Mexican border.
</P>
<P>
   _Lopez Lake in San Luis Obispo County.
</P>
<P>
   _Santa Margarita Lake near San Luis Obispo.
</P>
<P>
   _Lake Nacimiento, northwest of Paso Robles.
</P>
<P>
   Canoeists should always check conditions and weather before
putting their craft into the water.
</P>
<P>
   While it can be a difficult mission to find a canoe available
for rent, some sporting good stores carry the crafts, including
Sport Chalet _ (818) 710-0999 in West Hills _ and Irvine's
Southwind Kayaks, (949) 261-0200.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ As the South Korean economy boomed, so did
Son Kyoung- suk's career. As a clothing designer at Shinsegae
Department Store, she was steadily given more responsibility and
promoted to become a buyer, a job usually reserved for men.
</P>
<P>
   Then when South Korea's economy burst, so did Mrs. Son's career.
The company needed to slash costs, and so her department decided to
cut her position and those of five other women.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was only the women who were pushed out,'' recalled Mrs.
Son, her black eyes sparkling angrily through her glasses. So Mrs.
Son, 47, was dismissed April 30. Leaning forward angrily in her
chair, elegant in a black cotton suit that she had designed in
better days, she brooded that the Asian financial crisis has been a
special disaster for women.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line across most of Asia, from the office suites of
Japan to the peasant villages of Indonesia, has always been that
resources are allocated disproportionately to men and boys. In
times of bounty, there are plenty of leftovers for women; in lean
times like these, it is women who are the leanest of all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impact on women and girls is just catastrophic,'' said
Linda Tsao Yang, the American envoy to the Asian Development Bank
in the Philippines. Like many scholars and aid workers, she says
that as a result of the financial crisis, women are
disproportionately losing their jobs and families are pulling their
daughters out of school or even selling them to brothels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once these girls have dropped out of school, they'll never go
back,'' she said. ``And once they're pressured into prostitution,
that's the end of their lives. They will be a lost generation.''
</P>
<P>
   This generation is made up of girls like Juliana Aoetpa, an
8-year-old with olive skin, big black eyes and long black hair, who
lives in the village of Toeneka in eastern Indonesia. Indonesia has
been hit by the Asian financial crisis, by a drought and by
political turmoil that has further ravaged the economy. So
Juliana's parents told her to drop out of the local elementary
school and spend the days fetching water and gathering food.
</P>
<P>
   ``School is free,'' said her mother, Josisna Banue. ``But the
children have to buy a uniform, and we just couldn't afford it.''
</P>
<P>
   The uniform costs a bit less than $2.
</P>
<P>
   The number of children dropping out of elementary school in poor
areas of Indonesia has doubled in the last few months, aid
organizations say, and the great majority of the dropouts are
girls.

<P>
   ``People say it's better for girls to stay at home, so that they
can save money for the boys,'' said Meriana Kulla, a 17-year-old
girl on the Indonesian island of Sumba. ``Parents are afraid that
their money will run out, so they are pulling the girls out of
school.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not a new problem, for even before the crisis, girls in
Indonesia were six times more likely than boys to drop out of
school before the fourth grade. But the long economic boom in Asia
had been chipping away at the gender discrimination and creating
new opportunities for girls and women.
</P>
<P>
   Now, development experts say, that process has been reversed.
Interviews around the region suggest that in these times of
scarcity, job opportunities for women and educational opportunities
for girls are narrowing again.
</P>
<P>
   Even in South Korea, one of the richest of Asian countries,
families are pulling their daughters out of cram schools so that
they can devote the money to their sons.
</P>
<P>
   ``My older sister has four kids, three girls and then the
youngest is a son,'' said Lee In Sook, a bubbly, self-confident
25-year-old woman working in Seoul for an advertising company.
``Each child used to go to two or three after-school classes a
week, but after the economic crisis hit, their Dad ordered the
girls to drop out of everything but art classes. And since the boy
will carry on the family name, he was forced to continue taking
three classes, even though he didn't want to.''
</P>
<P>
   Is that fair?
</P>
<P>
   Miss Lee paused and looked a bit perplexed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be best if everyone could get opportunities,'' she
said thoughtfully, ``but I think it's right that a son gets the
most attention.''

   RURAL INDONESIA: Eating for Two On Bark and Roots
</P>
<P>
   Efriendi Bea is due to give birth in a few weeks. Mrs. Bea, 27,
sat on a creaky wooden bed in her dirt-floor hut, decorated with a
1990 calendar and glossy advertisements ripped out of an Indonesian
magazine, and said that despite her pregnancy she is eating nothing
but bark and roots foraged in the woods.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Bea has two girls, aged 10 and 4, and they are eating the
same crude diet and appear malnourished. The problem is that when
the family comes across more nutritious food, it goes elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we get some meat, my husband eats it,'' Mrs. Bea
explained. ``My husband has to work hard, farming and fishing, so
he takes the meat so he'll have energy.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a problem in many parts of Asia, for in times of
difficulty even most food and medical care go to males. Some say
this is because it is the men who do the hardest work and therefore
need the most energy. Others say it is because of traditions that
sons carry on the family name and family line, while daughters
marry into other families and represent a familial dead end.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars say that it is not that parents deliberately starve
their daughters, but rather that they take the choicest bits of
meat out of the pot and set them on the plate of the father or the
eldest son. Or parents rush their sick son to the doctor, but when
their daughter is ill they feel her forehead doubtfully and say,
``Well, let's see how you are tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, in much of Asia girls die at a higher rate compared
with boys than in most other parts of the world _ whether rich
areas like the United States or poor areas like sub-Saharan Africa.
It is too soon to see whether this financial crisis will worsen the
imbalance, but the risks are evident in households like Mrs. Bea's.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Bea and her family do have two chickens, six pigs and two
goats, but they do not eat the livestock. Instead they sell the
animals to get cash _ a chicken sells for about $1.25 _ and Mrs.
Bea's husband uses the cash himself.
</P>
<P>
   He spends a total of about 20 cents a week buying tobacco and
betel nuts. He rolls the tobacco up in scraps of paper to make his
own cigarettes, and he chews the betel nuts, which produce a mild
natural high and are widely consumed in rural areas of Asia.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The pattern is for families to save resources for the
fathers,'' said Dr. Anugerah Pekerti, the chairman of World Vision
Indonesia, an aid organization. ``When the fathers are asked why
they smoke cigarettes instead of buying food for their hungry
children, they say, `We can always make more children.'''
</P>
<P>
   Another consequence of the Asian financial crisis in the home
may simply be that a lot more women are getting beaten up every
evening. The evidence is anecdotal, but aid organizations and women
themselves say the strains of financial hardship are leading to
more violence in the homes. This appears most common not in middle
class families but in the villages and urban slums that have been
worst affected by the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't have enough food in the house, my husband hits
me,'' said Ina Ako, who was selling chilies in the open-air market
in the Indonesian city of Waikabubak. ``So I'm afraid of him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When there's no food,'' she mused sadly, ``the men get very
angry.''
</P>
<P>
   URBAN INDONESIA: Baby Delivered By a `Healer'
</P>
<P>
   On a narrow lane near Surabaya, one of Indonesia's largest
cities, Warni held her 22-day-old baby boy, Nurhadi. Her eyes shone
as she cuddled him, but the baby was thin and wizened and weak.
</P>
<P>
   Nurhadi is Mrs. Warni's only child, and she would have liked to
give birth in a clinic with the help of a real doctor. But that
would have cost $60 at a time when the economic crisis has hit the
family hard and her husband is struggling to survive by selling
fruit on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   So Mrs. Warni went to a traditional healer who charged only $6.
The birth went smoothly, but when Mrs. Warni returned to her
tin-roofed shack immediately afterward she found that she had no
milk to breast-feed the baby. She began feeding the baby formula _
ruinously expensive, at $1.50 for a week's supply _ and the baby
looks severely malnourished.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, even a proper clinic might not have been able to help
Mrs. Warni breast-feed and nurture her baby to proper health. But
health experts say the risks to both baby and mother are far
greater when women give birth without access to a doctor or
midwife.
</P>
<P>
   These days, because of the tough economic times, many women seem
to be following Mrs. Warni's approach. There are no statistics
available yet, but health workers say that more and more pregnant
women are cutting costs by turning not to a doctor or midwife but
to a traditional healer or to a mother or other relative.
</P>
<P>
   A result, health experts say, is more risk to babies and mothers
alike. Maternal mortality rates are already high in Southeast Asia,
for a woman is 16 times as likely to die in childbirth in Thailand
as in the United States, 30 times as likely in Indonesia, and 43
times as likely in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
   Birth rates may rise as well, for contraception is becoming
unaffordable for some families. In both Indonesia and Thailand,
birth control used to be free _ at least in theory _ but supplies
are now running out in some clinics, and Indonesia introduced
charges beginning in February.
</P>
<P>
   Poniti, a 25-year-old housewife near the Indonesian city of
Surabaya, said her clinic had raised the price of a contraceptive
injection, widely used in Indonesia and effective for three months,
from 50 cents to $1.20.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctor said if I wanted an ordinary IUD, it would be free,
but if I wanted a good one that would prevent me from getting
pregnant, it would be 3,000 rupiah,'' or about 30 cents, Mrs.
Poniti said. In the end, she decided to save money and take her
chances by not using any contraception at all.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN: First of All, Fire the Women
</P>
<P>
   In the labor market, women have been particularly hard-hit in
north Asian countries with a Confucian heritage, places like South
Korea and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the discrimination is not necessarily rooted in misogyny. In
an odd way, it is in some cases based on a genuine desire to
minimize the pain of layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a crisis, first of all we would have to fire the women,''
said Masamitsu Nishi, 47, the owner of a 40-employee construction
company in Japan's Mie Prefecture. ``We would retain men, because
they are the pillar of household earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would also fire young people, because they could always get
another job,'' Nishi added. ``But I would never want to dismiss the
main income-earner, because that might destroy a whole family.''
</P>
<P>
   The best and brightest women graduates can still often get good
jobs. A look at hiring records of 55 Japanese companies shows that
the proportion of women being hired for fast-track ``career'' jobs
this year is roughly the same as in 1990 or has even slightly
increased. Now as then, women are hired for about 15 percent of
these career-track jobs, which offer excellent prospects for
promotions but mean sacrificing one's family life for the company.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest challenge for women in northeast Asia, therefore,
is faced not be the most ambitious and talented women graduates who
compete for the career track but by more ordinary people _ young
women like Izumi Suzuki, a 22-year-old university senior in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not looking for a career-track job, because I hear that's
very tough,'' Miss Suzuki said, as she took a break from poring
over company recruiting materials in her university library. ``So
I'm looking for an ordinary job, and that's very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, women like Miss Suzuki did not enter the career
track but worked as OLs, or office ladies. They are the least
important employees _ in Japanese they are called ``flowers of the
workplace'' and are treated as partly ornamental _ and so when
companies run into financial distress those are the kinds of
positions that are cut out.
</P>
<P>
   Some Japanese say, therefore, that the discrimination is not so
much in the workplace, which is quite naturally weeding out the
non-essential staff. More broadly, they say, the problem lies in
the social values that channel young women to the slow track and
that require mothers, but not fathers, to take off from work to
take part in school activities and look after sick children.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Suzuki noted that the Japanese term ``hyogaki,'' or ice
age, has been used for several years to refer to the job market for
women since the economy slowed sharply at the beginning of the
1990s. But now as hiring of women has been reduced further, young
women are dolefully referring to this as the ``cho-hyogaki,'' or
super ice age.

<P>
   THAILAND: 15-Year-Old Sold Into a Brothel
</P>
<P>
   The economic crisis has driven families in places like Thailand
and Indonesia to sell their own daughters to brothels.
</P>
<P>
   When the downturn hit Samrong Harwiset's family in northeast
Thailand late last fall, Mrs. Samrong suddenly found new monetary
value in her prettiest granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter and son-in-law are working in Bangkok, and so I'm
looking after the five grandchildren on my own,'' Mrs. Samrong
explained as she sat on a mat inside her home. ``Then with the
crisis, my daughter stopped sending money.''
</P>
<P>
   To get by, Mrs. Samrong and her grandchildren collect herbs in
the mountains to sell. But that is not enough to cover expenses, so
when a trader came by and offered $40 in cash for her 15-year-old
granddaughter, Mrs. Samrong agreed to the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we'd had money, she wouldn't have needed to go,'' Mrs.
Samrong said unapologetically. ``I just wanted her to get money.
That way she could help her brothers and sisters.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Samrong says that the trader told her that the girl would
work as a maid in Bangkok, but other girls had been sold to
brothels before in the village and the neighbors doubt that Mrs.
Samrong was so naive.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about that, Mrs. Samrong shrugged her shoulders
ambiguously. ``When you're poor,'' she said, ``you believe
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Although such transactions have long been common in Southeast
Asia, they seem to have become more frequent in recent months,
according to social workers and local news reports. There have
never been reliable statistics on the sale of girls, and the
authorities often do not intervene.
</P>
<P>
   In Indonesia, local newspapers and aid workers report that
complex deals are now taking place in which loans are made to
peasants with a woman as the collateral. If the peasant defaults,
then the lender gets the woman.
</P>
<P>
   One study by the University Diponegoro in the major Indonesian
city of Semarang found that since the crisis the number of
Semarang's street children aged 13 to 15 had increased 43 percent.
The study also found that 30 percent of girls who became street
children had turned to prostitution to support themselves.
</P>
<P>
   One might think that the sex industry would suffer during
difficult economic times because men have less cash to pay for
entertainment. But as social workers describe it, the business is
almost entirely supply-driven: it expands because there are more
girls desperate for any cash at all, even at much lower rates than
normal.
</P>
<P>
   So that is how Mrs. Samrong's granddaughter, Lamphan Ngaophumin,
a radiant girl with chipmunk cheeks and doe eyes, came to be sold
to a trader and eventually resold to a buyer in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then the brothel-owner said, `I bought you, and I can do
whatever I like with you,'' Lamphan recalled, a tremor in her
voice. ``They locked me up and I thought I would die. Every day I
cried. I tried to slash my wrists, but the cuts weren't deep and
they bandaged me up so that my arms eventually healed.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamphan said that the brothel-owner tried to break her spirit by
starving her and by threatening to make her eat excrement, but
still she managed to escape _ and was promptly detained by police,
who returned her to the brothel-owner. She had managed to get word
to relatives, however, and they came and rescued her.
</P>
<P>
   She came back to the village without seeing a doctor or getting
blood tests, so it is unclear whether she has HIV, the virus that
causes AIDS, a possibility she does not seem to have thought of.
She is simply back in the village, living with her grandmother
again and willing to forgive her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever I think about it, I start crying again,'' Lamphan
said softly. ``But I don't blame my Grandma. She didn't know. And
we needed the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Samrong, only slightly abashed, also seems to think that
all has ended happily.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be OK,'' she said reassuringly. ``She still won't have
any trouble getting a husband.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Lamphan has every reason to be terrified at the thought
of leaving the village again, she says that she must go once more
to look for money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some friends and I will go to Bangkok again to try to get
work,'' she said. ``There's somebody in the village who can
introduce me to a factory where I would make wicker furniture. I'll
be really careful this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I have to do it, because we need to earn the money.''

SOUTH AFRICA USED TOXINS ON ENEMIES, COMMISSION TOLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE TOWN, South Africa _ Screwdrivers held tiny poison-filled
cylinders, rings had spring-loaded compartments hiding deadly
powders, vials of whisky were laced with the toxic herbicide
paraquat and even peppermints were spiked with botulism.
</P>
<P>
   During testimony before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission
Wednesday and earlier this week, a parade of witnesses has made
clear that undetectable ways of murdering political opponents was a
high priority of a chemical and biological warfare campaign during
the apartheid era.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of dollars were spent on developing James Bond-type
gadgets, though sometimes the results seemed more in keeping with
the bumbling Maxwell Smart. The head of one front company the
military used described accidentally poisoning himself when he
showed an operative how the ring worked.
</P>
<P>
   And several notable assassination efforts apparently failed
miserably. In one case, not enough of a toxic substance was poured
into five pairs of the victim's underwear. In another case, a
poisoned shirt was borrowed from the intended victim who escaped
injury altogether, but a friend who wore the shirt died.
</P>
<P>
   The commission heard testimony indicating that such poisoned
gadgets appeared to be distributed in volume to agents working for
the government. They were among an arsenal of techniques used to
brutalize anti-apartheid activists.
</P>
<P>
   The exact extent of South Africa's chemical and biological
program and whether it included weapons for mass destruction
remains unclear and is likely to remain so after this week's
testimony before the commission, which is investigating atrocities
of the past.
</P>
<P>
   But the hearings have offered a compelling and sometimes
detailed glimpse into the program, code named Project B or Project
Coast and headed by Wouter Basson, a cardiologist who was once the
personal doctor to the former president, P.W. Botha. Basson is now
facing an array of criminal charges including fraud and theft.
</P>
<P>
   The government has expressed unease with the commission's
hearings and asked this week that the panel hold its sessions
behind closed doors. It said it wanted to keep any information that
could help anyone build such weapons out of the public domain. But
the commission went ahead with public hearings, saying it would be
careful of such considerations.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, some commission officials say they are focusing on
those aspects of the program that aimed at undoing anti-apartheid
efforts. There seems to be no shortage in this area.
</P>
<P>
   One witness, Jan Lourens, a bio-engineer who in the late 1980s
headed a company called Protechnik, said his company began by
making protective clothing to withstand chemical attacks, but soon
developed a sideline bringing out tailor-made gadgetry including
umbrellas with poisoned tips, soap boxes packed with explosives and
a walking stick that could fire poisonous pellets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never told what they were for, but it was quite
obvious,'' he said. ''I was never under any illusion that it was
for any purpose other than assassinating human beings.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Lourens had worked for a different front company that
was trying to make substances to reduce the fertility and virility
of blacks. Lourens said he had been told the drugs would be for use
among woman who were fighting against the Angolan government and
were falling pregnant too often, a story that he said even he found
implausible. The South African government supported the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Lourens said his laboratory took up on the project
experimenting on animals, particularly baboons. Among his jobs was
to design a restraining chair for the baboons and a stimulator to
collect semen from the animals. He said he witnessed the testing of
tear gas on caged baboons.
</P>
<P>
   Another witness, Schalk van Rensburg, who worked at another of
the front companies, Roodeplaat Research Laboratory, said it
produced chocolates and cigarettes infected with anthrax, beer
bottles containing botulism and sugar laced with salmonella.
Included in a document titled ``list of sales'' were 32 bottles of
cholera culture.
</P>
<P>
   The hearings have also explored what some commissioners have
described as the ``underlying criminality'' of the projects, which
apparently cost millions of dollars and ended up making
millionaires of some of the people in charge.
</P>
<P>
   One reluctant witness, Dr. Wynand Swanepoel, a dentist who said
he was the managing director of the Roodeplaat lab but had no idea
what the company was making, apparently invested about $10,000 in
company stock and a few years later made almost $800,000 when the
company was sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would just call that a good investment, I suppose?'' one
of the commission officials asked Swanepoel Wednesday. Swanepoel
replied, ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Some witnesses have said they produced drugs usually used for
recreational purposes, known as Ectasy and Mandrex. They said they
suspected that members of the military simply sold the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The man who was in charge of South Africa's chemical and
biological warfare efforts, Basson, was arrested in January 1997
when he was caught with about $20,000 worth of Ectasy tablets. He
has since been charged with theft and fraud charges involving the
disappearance of about $6 million in government funds.
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Basson was expected to testify at this week's hearings and had
promised in the past to tell all to the Truth Commission. But on
Wednesday his lawyers argued that he should be excused from
testifying, claiming it would deny him a right to a fair trial.
Dressed in a bright African shirt, Basson seemed to have a hard
time sitting still as his lawyers argued.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of the biological and chemical warfare programs
remains something of a mystery. Former government officials have
claimed that the country began a defensive effort in the 1980s
after suspecting that they would face such weapons in Angola, where
they were supporting the rebels and the Soviet Union was supporting
the government.
</P>
<P>
   Experts contend that South Africa developed nuclear bombs and
had the expertise and resources to develop chemical and biological
warfare. The country has since dismantled its nuclear weapons and
signed treaties against chemical and biological warfare.
</P>
<P>
   But rumors persist that South Africa may have used chemical
agents against Mozambique a decade ago. The Russian news agency
Tass also alleged that South Africa used deadly herbicides in
Namibia in 1984. Some experts suggest that outbreaks of cholera in
African National Congress training camps in Angola may have been
the work of the South African military.
</P>
<P>
   ``They seem to have used their abilities for some pretty odd
things,'' said Laurie Boulden, a researcher with the South African
Institute of International Affairs. ``It all sounds like a bit of a
bumbling spy novel.''

SERBIA SAID TO USE WARPLANES IN ATTACKS ON KOSOVO ALBANIANS
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Serbia has used military warplanes in addition to army
troops and special police units in its attacks on ethnic Albanian
villages in Kosovo province over the last two weeks, a senior U.S.
official involved in monitoring the situation there said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In light of that information, other officials said that defense
ministers of the NATO alliance might ask its military authorities
to speed up planning for possible allied air strikes against
strategic targets that could include air bases and command centers
in Serbia. Allied defense ministers meet in Brussels on Thursday to
discuss efforts to stop the Serbian offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Another U.S. official said that observers had seen bombing raids
by Serbian jets and artillery attacks that had resulted in enormous
destruction of homes, with the apparent aim of terrorizing the
ethnic Albanian population.
</P>
<P>
   Military sweeps have driven 80,000 people from their homes,
according to estimates, in an effort by Serbia to quash an
independence movement in the province. Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic revoked the autonomy of the overwhelmingly Albanian
province in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the United States, Russia, and four European
countries met in Paris on Wednesday and weighed giving Serbia a
deadline for resuming talks with civilian leaders in the province,
diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   Western and Russian foreign ministers, meeting in London on
Friday, plan to issue a strong warning to Milosevic to stop the
attacks and resume talks with Albanian leaders, the diplomats said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   U.S. and French officials said after Wednesday's Paris meeting
that Russian representatives in the international Contact Group
that monitors developments in the Balkans agreed that Milosevic,
not the Albanian leadership under Ibrahim Rugova, was responsible
for the recent deterioration of the situation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But Russian President Boris Yeltsin indicated in Bonn on
Wednesday that Russia would block moves at the United Nations to
authorize NATO military measures to halt the violence in Kosovo.
Russian officials in Moscow said Yeltsin could meet Milosevic soon
to try to get him to resume talks with Rugova and halt the
violence.
</P>
<P>
   British Prime Minister Tony Blair told Parliament in London,
``The only circumstance in which we will insure that President
Milosevic responds to diplomatic pressure is if that is backed up
by the threat, the credible threat, of the use of military force.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary Defense William Cohen said, on his way to the
NATO meeting in Brussels, that the United States did not exclude
the possibility that military force might have to be used to keep
Kosovo from exploding into war, as Bosnia-Herzegovina did in the
early 1990s, and drawing in other countries.
</P>
<P>
   The allied defense ministers are expected to ask NATO military
planners to accelerate planning for possible troop deployments for
peacekeeping missions along the border between Kosovo and
neighboring Albania or inside Kosovo, NATO officials said. They
could also ask the military to draw up targets including Serbian
air bases or airfields from which attacks on civilians in Kosovo
have been launched.
</P>
<P>
   But the allies are still some way from actually authorizing
military action. Russian diplomats have agreed so far only that
military means cannot be excluded.
</P>
<P>
   Britain has been circulating a draft Security Council resolution
authorizing NATO to use force to preserve peace in Kosovo, but
Russia, a permanent member of the Security Council, could veto the
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Jacques Blot, the senior French diplomat who took part in
Wednesday's talks on Kosovo in Paris, said that Russia joined the
five other countries Wednesday in not excluding the possibility
that military measures might have to be considered. But France and
Germany, also in Wednesday's talks, say they believe that a United
Nations resolution would be required before NATO could take any
action in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov is to meet with
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and other foreign ministers
in London on Friday. The ministers, representing all the countries
that met in Paris on Wednesday, plus Japan and Canada, would
probably get Russian cooperation in issuing a set of international
demands to Milosevic, Blot said.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting German concerns about the increasing flow of ethnic
Albanian refugees from Kosovo into Germany, officials in Paris said
Wednesday that the European Union would be asked to come up with
immediate proposals for channeling and handling the flow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time is of the essence to produce a political settlement,''
Blot said.

AIR FRANCE PILOTS END STRIKE
</HEADLINE>
   (dc) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Air France began limping back toward normal operations
Wednesday after pilots accepted a seven-year pay freeze, ending a
strike that had grounded most flights since the beginning of the
month.
</P>
<P>
   The strike, on the eve of the World Cup soccer championships,
which began Wednesday, had embarrassed the airline, the official
carrier for the games, and the French government, which owns the
company and has spent millions to welcome the world to the
tournament. It also inconvenienced thousands of soccer fans, who
had to scramble to find alternative transportation.
</P>
<P>
   The airline, 20 percent of which will be offered to the public
later this year, agreed to end a two-tiered salary system that put
pilots hired after 1997 on a lower pay scale than ones hired before
then. The settlement also allows pilots to take part of their
salaries in Air France stock instead of cash over the next seven
years.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots seemed satisfied with the settlement, which is to be
finished by Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the whole, the agreement is a good one for everybody,''
said Christian Paris, a spokesman for the SNPL, the main pilots
union. ``The company had its constraints and its objectives to
achieve.''
</P>
<P>
   Air France officials said the agreement would result in an
annual saving of $83 million in salaries, an average of $26,000 per
pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Their average annual salary of $123,000 is higher than that of
any other carrier, according to the airline.
</P>
<P>
   ``This global accord is aimed at assuring the development of Air
France by improving its competitiveness with regards to its
rivals,'' a statement by the airline said.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, a socialist, who had said over the
weekend that the government was prepared to intervene to end the
strike, said the settlement ensured that the airline, which nearly
went bankrupt five years ago but reported a profit last year, would
have a future.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Cyril Spinetta, the company's president, said Air France
had lost $166 million in revenue during the 10-day strike. British
Airways, which put on extra 747 jumbo jets from Britain to fly in
thousands of fans for Wednesday night's opening match between
Brazil and Scotland, estimated that it took in $1.6 million extra
every day the stoppage lasted.
</P>
<P>
   Other French transportation workers continued to make travel a
dicey experience in some cities. A railroad engineers' strike
stopped service on part of the Paris rapid-transit system but had
little effect on mainline train travel except in Marseilles, where
strikers kept several high-speed express trains from leaving the
station, the national railway said.

   &QL;  SHUSTER PROBE ON HOLD
</P>
<P>
   By Paul Kane
</P>
<P>
   States News Service
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, June 10 -- A day after seeing his most important
legislative legacy signed into law, the $200 billion highway bill,
Rep. Bud Shuster faced a less glamorous piece of his legacy: an
ongoing investigation into his top aide's role in an alleged
influence peddling scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Shuster, R-Everett, chairman of the House Transportation
Committee, learned Wednesday that the congressional investigation
into how he raises and spends his campaign cash has been delayed at
the request of the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Department of Justice has indicated that its ongoing
criminal investigation may relate to matters similar to those under
investigation by the committee,'' the House ethics committee said
in a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   At Justice's request, the committee is delaying interviewing
witnesses or taking depositions. This could spell trouble for the
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Boston won an indictment
of Ann Eppard, Shuster's fundraiser, on charges that she took
$230,000 in illegal payments from contractors connected to the $11
billion ``Big Dig'' highway project in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment alleges Eppard took the money while she served as
Shuster's chief of staff, a position she held from the early 1970s
until 1994, when she became a transportation lobbyist. She has
remained close to Shuster, and still serves as his political
adviser and fundraiser.
</P>
<P>
   When the indictment came down, Shuster aides made clear that it
did not allege any wrongdoing by the chairman himself, and denied
that Eppard had done anything wrong. Shuster could not be reached
for comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the House ethics committee has probed a
complaint about Shuster's close ties to Eppard, who lobbies for
contractors and communities before Shuster's committee. She also
travels with Shuster on fundraising junkets, during which sometimes
the lawmaker conducts official committee business during the day
and then takes campaign contributions from the same highway
contractors at nighttime fundraisers.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of Shuster, who question whether his support for
projects is for sale, say Wednesday's developments may mean that
the Big Dig probe could be closing in on Shuster, and that the U.S.
Attorneys don't want House investigators to get in their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may be an indication that there is substantial overlap,''
said Gary Ruskin, who runs the Congressional Accountability
Project, a one-man watchdog group that filed the ethics complaint
against Shuster.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorneys in Boston refused to
comment, other than to say that the investigation is ``ongoing.''
No trial date has been set for Eppard, and discovery is due in the
fall.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Herald reported in March that the U.S. Attorneys
wanted to ensure that the House ethics committee didn't offer
immunity to too many witnesses in the congressional probe. Immunity
before Congress would leave witnesses free from prosecution under
the Justice probe.
</P>
<P>
   Ruskin said he was unable to confirm the Boston Herald account,
but indicated that if the ethics committee is now delaying its
investigation, prosecutors would be free to pursue the Shuster case
without congressional interference.
</P>
<P>
   The ethics committee said in its statement that the delay would
not ``affect the committee's ability to issue and enforce
subpoenas'' in its probe. It did not say what impact it would have
on immunity.
</P>
<P>
   Shuster's influence over highway projects has been legendary,
even when Republicans were in the minority. His biggest legislative
victory came on Tuesday, when President Clinton signed the $200
billion highway bill that Shuster co-wrote.
</P>
<P>
   If he were indicted in a criminal probe, Shuster would
immediately have to step down as chairman under House rules. He
could continue serving in Congress until his trial.

 ESSAY: SHIFTING OPINION ON MISSILE DEFENSE  (ja) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For years, when hawkish Republicans uttered the
phrase ``missile defense,'' dovish Democrats would respond with a
derisive Bronx cheer: ``Star Wars! Pie in the sky! Cost too much
and would never work!''
</P>
<P>
   Partisan positions froze and debate was paralyzed. Tens of
billions were spent on research just to keep our hand in but with
no hope of actually defending the nation against incoming nuclear
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats asked, with some reason: How in the world could we
build a foolproof shield in the sky against 10,000 Soviet missiles?
Wasn't it wiser to rely on the threat of mutual suicide that served
us so well during the Cold War?
</P>
<P>
   But circumstances changed. The threat is now no longer an
overwhelming rain of missiles from Russia, but only a dozen or 20
from rogue states or terrorist groups. That's more manageable.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of missile defense then tried a different argument: A
shield in the sky would not stop a terrorist from sneaking a bomb
into the United States in a suitcase.
</P>
<P>
   True enough, and methods of detecting smuggled nuclear and germ
weapons need refinement. But nations like China, Iran, Iraq, North
Korea, India and Pakistan have not been investing heavily in
suitcases. For some reason, they have been spending national
treasure on long-range missiles, swapping know-how, importing
hungry Russian scientists, buying or stealing American
missile-guidance technology.
</P>
<P>
   From this we may deduce that the preferred method of delivery is
a missile, and that a monomaniacal dictator or a terrorist with
little to lose would not be deterred, as Soviet leaders were, by
the assurance of massive retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   As the nuclear club expands and as missiles become cheaper and
rangier, the threat increases of an accidental launch _ or of an
unintended missile headed our way during a nuclear war among other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   What could we do about it? At the moment, nothing. Most
Americans do not realize that our armed forces have no way of
stopping the most likely weapon to be used against us. We spend a
quarter-trillion dollars a year for defense and it buys the
population of American cities zero defense against missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Why do we allow this terrible anomaly to exist? Some die-hard
doves insist that our debatable 1972 ABM treaty with the defunct
Soviet Union locks us in forever to ``mutual assured destruction''
(MAD) _ even as Boris Yeltsin prepares to run for a third term on
the theory that Russia is not the Soviet Union. President Clinton,
mired in decade-old rhetoric, still professes to see that treaty as
the ``cornerstone of strategic stability.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan argues, incredibly, that no defense
is needed because the CIA would give us three years' warning of any
threat. Those are the same spooks who assured us in 1990 that
Saddam Hussein was 10 years away from a nuclear device (postwar
inspection showed it had been less than one year), and the same who
were caught flatfooted last month by India's blasts.
</P>
<P>
   But we are beginning to see evidence of a paradigm shift in the
thinking of both sides about the threat of ``incoming.'' Last week,
as Levin led a filibuster against missile defense, only a bare
minimum of 40 Democrats enabled him to block the will of a growing
Senate bipartisan majority.
</P>
<P>
   Even within the Clinton Defense Department, support is growing
for deploying the Navy's Aegis fleet air defense system, a step
toward serious missile defense. Secretary Bill Cohen's choice for
chief technical adviser, the former NASA hand Hans Mark, was
welcomed last week by Senate Armed Services as the harbinger of a
new administration attitude toward countering missile dangers.
</P>
<P>
   The center of gravity in the old ``Star Wars'' debate has moved.
Ronald Reagan turns out not to have been deranged on defense _ only
ahead of his time. For those concerned about our new vulnerability,
the trick is not to adopt a nyah-nyah, told-you-so posture, but to
give proponents of the old strategy a graceful exit citing changed
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is absolutely no question the nation will have missile
defense in the future,'' Dr. Jacques Gansler, a top Clinton Defense
official, has said. ``The question is when.''
</P>
<P>
   The threat is here. The money is there. The answer is now.

ECONOMIC SCENE: WAR ON DRUGS IS UNDER ATTACK
</HEADLINE>
   (dc) 
 By PETER PASSELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the war on drugs is indeed a battle of good vs. evil, then
Satan is gaining some impressive allies. An open letter to the U.N.
secretary-general, on the occasion of the General Assembly's
special session on drugs, asserts that ``the global war on drugs is
now causing more harm than drug abuse itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the signers of the letter were Javier Perez de Cuellar,
the former secretary-general; Robert Strauss, the Democratic
Party's lobbyist-lawyer; George Shultz, the former secretary of
everything to Republican presidents, and even Walter Cronkite.
</P>
<P>
   More striking from the parochial perspective of this column, the
list includes high-profile economists ranging from Milton Friedman
(the Hoover Institution) to Jagdish Bhagwati (Columbia) to Gavin
Wright (Stanford).
</P>
<P>
   On second thought, perhaps it is not so surprising. Most
economists these days are alert to the unintended consequences of
regulation. And in the case of drug policy, they do not have to
look far. ``The harmful side effects _ everything from the spread
of AIDS to violent crime to abuse of civil liberties _ simply
overwhelm the benefits,'' said Jeffrey Miron of Boston University.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to reduce illegal drug use is to reduce the supply
or the demand. Consider supply-side strategies first.
</P>
<P>
   Common sense says the place to start is at the border, or even
in farmers' fields. But in this case, suggests Peter Reuter of the
University of Maryland's School of Public Policy, common sense is a
ticket to frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Smugglers of low-bulk drugs have adapted easily to interdiction
efforts, he says. Confiscation of large quantities at sea or at the
border has only modest impact on importers since the value of the
drugs outside the country is so much lower than the value once they
cross the border.
</P>
<P>
   By the same token, discouraging drug production by subsidizing
alternative crops is a fools' game. Drug entrepreneurs can always
afford to pay more since the cost of the raw material is a minute
fraction of the wholesale price of the delivered product.
</P>
<P>
   What about disrupting wholesale and retail markets on this side
of the border? It can and has been done through policing efforts _
though at a cost that makes economists, as well as legislators and
civil libertarians, wince. With more than a half-million arrests
annually for marijuana possession alone, the bulk of police, prison
and court resources is now devoted to drug law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Miron notes, for supply-side policies to work, drug
prices must rise. And if, as most economists believe, the use of
drugs is not particularly sensitive to price, the total value of
drugs sold actually increases when enforcement is successful. This
breeds ancillary crime as users steal to pay for their habits and
dealers fight over turf.
</P>
<P>
   If supply-side anti-drug policies create a vicious circle of
higher prices and more crime, demand-side policies should lead to a
virtuous one. Lower demand means lower prices, lower revenue and
less incentive to steal and kill.
</P>
<P>
   By no coincidence, then, demand-reducing drug treatment and
education have become the centrist politician's mantra. Reuter
acknowledges that treatment is often cost-effective. But he doubts
that even the most dedicated treatment policy would reduce
addiction by more than one-third.
</P>
<P>
   Miron points to another problem: pushing addicts off illegal
drugs all too often pushes them into legal ones _ methadone,
alcohol and tobacco. ``You have to be skeptical that the benefits
of treatment would exceed the benefits of simply minimizing the
adverse side effects of illicit drug use,'' Miron said.
</P>
<P>
   For Miron the best of all possible worlds would be one in which
dangerous drugs are legal, with their use discouraged with taxes
and social pressure. But many people who buy arguments against the
flat-out prohibition cannot stomach policies that would probably
lead to greater drug consumption.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Reuter argues that legalization has become a straw
man that diverts attention from the messy task of reforming
regulation. That might include the decriminalization of drug
possession without making it legal to sell drugs for a profit. Or
the quiet abandonment of expensive border interdiction. And it
would certainly mean a more nuanced policy in which the use of
marijuana by adults ceased to preoccupy the justice system.
</P>
<P>
   Is the world ready for a change in drug policy as usual? Ethan
Nadelmann, the director of the Lindesmith Center in New York, which
sponsored the open letter, is encouraged by the growing numbers of
very important people ready to take a stand in favor of a fresh
start. But he doubts that the United Nations' own drug bureaucracy
can lead the way. ``It's hard to turn that big boat around,'' he
lamented.

     `MARRIAGE PENALTY' RELIEF AT A GLANCE
 &HT;     With TOBACCO.
 &HT;     By SAMAR ABULHASSAN 
 &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Key facts about the ``marriage penalty'' income tax
reduction approved Wednesday by the Senate:
</P>
<P>
   WHO BENEFITS: Only married couples with an adjusted gross income
below $50,000, as calculated before the marriage penalty deduction.
</P>
<P>
   HOW MUCH THEY WILL SAVE: The current standard deduction of
$6,900 for couples filing jointly would gradually increase over 10
years by $3,300, to $10,200. For a married individual filing a
separate return, the deduction would increase by $1,650.
</P>
<P>
   The deduction lowers the amount of income that is subject to
taxes. So, if a couple were in the 15 percent tax bracket, their
eventual $3,300 deduction would lead to a $495 tax savings.
</P>
<P>
   HOW IT IS PHASED IN: Next year, 25 percent of the reduction
would take effect. The percentage would increase to 30 percent in
2000, 40 percent in 2003, 50 percent in 2006, 60 percent in 2007
and 100 percent in 2008.
</P>
<P>
   INFLATION ADJUSTMENT: As inflation increases from year to year,
the size of the deduction increases accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   HEALTH BENEFIT FOR SELF-EMPLOYED: The self-employed will receive
a 100 percent deduction for health insurance costs beginning Jan.
1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   TOTAL COST: The tax cuts will cut federal revenue by $16 billion
through 2002 and $30 billion in the following five years. Of that
amount, $11.8 billion is earmarked for marriage penalty relief and
$4.2 billion for the health insurance deduction for the
self-employed through 2002. For the following five years, $26.9
billion is earmarked for marriage penalty relief while $3.1 billion
is dedicated to the health insurance deduction.

ADVERTISING: ABC LIGHTENS UP ON LAST YEAR'S TV CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ No need to wonder where the yellow went, to echo the
old Pepsodent toothpaste jingle. ABC is bringing back for a second
season an irreverent, yellow-tinted campaign that satirically
salutes those intermingled twinges of guilt and pleasure felt by
most Americans as they watch television.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign's initial iteration, promoting the ABC network
brand and its 1997-98 prime-time programs, was one of the most
discussed and debated in advertising annals. Critics complained
that the ads, carrying the theme ``TV is good,'' mocked the
national preoccupation with the tube by presenting arch, hip
slogans like ``Don't worry, you've got billions of brain cells,''
``The couch is your friend'' and ``You can talk to your wife
anytime.''
</P>
<P>
   For 1998-99, however, the campaign, by the Venice, Calif.,
office of TBWA Chiat/Day, is being ``evolved,'' which is adspeak
for ``You don't like it? All right, already! We'll change it.'' The
revamped ads were introduced Wednesday at a lunch-time news
conference at which everything from the pencils to the electrical
cables under a table to the liquid soap in the men's room was
colored, yes, yellow.
</P>
<P>
   The primary differences for 1998-99 are that the brand-centric
ads are supplemented by considerably more series-specific pitches
and ``TV is good'' is supplanted by the more ardent ``We love TV.''
In a promotional videotape shown at the news conference, Drew
Carey, the star of one of ABC's few hits, ``The Drew Carey Show,''
lampooned the lampoon by rendering the new theme as ``Everybody
loves everybody else on ABC.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``We'' in ``We love TV'' _ which evokes the ``I Love L.A.''
commercial that a TBWA Chiat/Day predecessor, Chiat/Day, created
for Nike for the 1984 Summer Olympics _ makes the campaign less
generic and more directly linked to ABC, a unit of Walt Disney Co.
</P>
<P>
   ABC has been struggling to overcome problems ranging from a
ratings slide among its core younger family viewers to a failure to
develop popular new programs to intensifying competition from cable
networks. Those difficulties are indicative of the troubles
confronting broadcast television as commercial time is sold to
advertisers for the new season.
</P>
<P>
   That process, known as the up-front market because the time is
sold before the season begins, will be completed soon; industry
analysts predict the amount may total $6 billion to $6.1 billion
for the four major networks, or flat with to slightly ahead of
1997-98.
</P>
<P>
   The ABC share of the up-front market is projected at $1.5
billion to $1.6 billion, down slightly from or the same as last
season. That would be ``a home run,'' said Joe Mandese, editor of
The Myers Report, an industry newsletter, given the network's
travails.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story isn't so much growth anymore,'' said Mandese, who
attended the news conference, ``as preserving your share.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the new ABC ads are as pointedly cheeky as their
predecessors. They include: ``Hello? It's free,'' ``Don't just sit
there. OK, just sit there,'' ``Before TV, two world wars. After TV,
zero'' and ``You're breathing. We're broadcasting. Let's get
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Many, though, are softer, less barbed and snide _ even warmer
and fuzzier, if not kinder and gentler: ``Without a TV, how would
you know where to put the sofa?'', ``TV, so good they named a
frozen meal after it'' and ``If TV's so bad for you, why is there
one in every hospital room?''
</P>
<P>
   The changes don't mean that ABC executives ``want to run from''
the campaign, asserted Alan Cohen, executive vice president for
marketing at the network, because it was ``a whole new way to use
our promotional time to entertain people so they're less likely to
reach for the remote.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew it had a little bite,'' Cohen said, ``and that some
people would say, `I don't want anyone to tell me to watch more
TV.''' The revisions, he added, while ``keeping the sensibility the
same,'' make the campaign ``more fun, a little more celebratory
about television,'' so ``it's easier to get the joke.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't be doing it again,'' Cohen said, ``if viewers
weren't telling us it was effective, that it gave us an identity.''
</P>
<P>
   The principal executives on the ABC account at TBWA Chiat/Day, a
unit of Omnicom Group, also attended the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, the campaign might have come off as defensive,''
said Rich Siegel, associate creative director, ``because it was the
first time someone stood up for the medium.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Gentile, creative director, said: ``Some of the press last
year took it very seriously when it was meant to be lighthearted.
You see studies about watching TV and people say they watch two
hours and the reality is they watch like eight hours. We want to
say it's OK to come out of the closet _ you can watch eight hours
and have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   So that's who will be coming out of the closet next season on
ABC: devoted TV viewers.
</P>
<P>
   The budget for the 1998-99 campaign, which begins on Monday, is
$15 million to $16 million, Cohen said, compared with a budget of
$12 million last season. The goal is to reach the estimated 117
million Americans who are ages 18 to 49 _ the crucial ABC
demographic group _ 44 times each with promotions.
</P>
<P>
   A substantial portion of the campaign is devoted to commercials
on ABC. Some promote stars and their series, including Carey,
Michael J. Fox of ``Spin City,'' Dennis Franz of ``NYPD Blue'' and
Jenna Elfman of ``Dharma &AMP; Greg'' with tongue-in-cheek patriotic
salutes from ``the American Broadcasting Co.'' and spoofs of
commercials for products like Nike sneakers. Other spots parody
``Great Inspirations in Television,'' like the invention of the
remote control and the TV tray table.
</P>
<P>
   There will also be print ads, billboards, transit posters and
pitches in so-called place-based, or ambient, media venues like
food carts, coffee cups, beach trash barrels, airplane banners,
personal ads in weekly newspapers (``Single, fun-loving appliance
seeks companionship'') and even fruit stickers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The heavy emphasis will be on bananas,'' Cohen said, laughing.
``You can guess why.''
</P>
<P>
   Bananas? Naturally. Imagine what the critics would say if ABC
chose lemons.

COMMENTARY: STOP THE `INCOMING!' 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For years, when hawkish Republicans uttered the
phrase ``missile defense,'' dovish Democrats would respond with a
derisive Bronx cheer: ``Star Wars! Pie in the sky! Cost too much
and would never work!''
</P>
<P>
   Partisan positions froze and debate was paralyzed. Tens of
billions were spent on research just to keep our hand in but with
no hope of actually defending the nation against incoming nuclear
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats asked, with some reason: How in the world could we
build a foolproof shield in the sky against 10,000 Soviet missiles?
Wasn't it wiser to rely on the threat of mutual suicide that served
us so well during the Cold War?
</P>
<P>
   But circumstances changed. The threat is now no longer an
overwhelming rain of missiles from Russia, but only a dozen or 20
from rogue states or terrorist groups. That's more manageable.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of missile defense then tried a different argument: A
shield in the sky would not stop a terrorist from sneaking a bomb
into the United States in a suitcase.
</P>
<P>
   True enough, and methods of detecting smuggled nuclear and germ
weapons need refinement. But nations like China, Iran, Iraq, North
Korea, India and Pakistan have not been investing heavily in
suitcases. For some reason, they have been spending national
treasure on long-range missiles, swapping know-how, importing
hungry Russian scientists, buying or stealing American
missile-guidance technology.
</P>
<P>
   From this we may deduce that the preferred method of delivery is
a missile, and that a monomaniacal dictator or a terrorist with
little to lose would not be deterred, as Soviet leaders were, by
the assurance of massive retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   As the nuclear club expands and as missiles become cheaper and
rangier, the threat increases of an accidental launch _ or of an
unintended missile headed our way during a nuclear war among other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   What could we do about it? At the moment, nothing. Most
Americans do not realize that our armed forces have no way of
stopping the most likely weapon to be used against us. We spend a
quarter-trillion dollars a year for defense and it buys the
population of American cities zero defense against missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Why do we allow this terrible anomaly to exist? Some die-hard
doves insist that our debatable 1972 ABM treaty with the defunct
Soviet Union locks us in forever to ``mutual assured destruction''
(MAD) _ even as Boris Yeltsin prepares to run for a third term on
the theory that Russia is not the Soviet Union. President Clinton,
mired in decade-old rhetoric, still professes to see that treaty as
the ``cornerstone of strategic stability.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan argues, incredibly, that no defense
is needed because the CIA would give us three years' warning of any
threat. Those are the same spooks who assured us in 1990 that
Saddam Hussein was 10 years away from a nuclear device (postwar
inspection showed it had been less than one year), and the same who
were caught flatfooted last month by India's blasts.
</P>
<P>
   But we are beginning to see evidence of a paradigm shift in the
thinking of both sides about the threat of ``incoming.'' Last week,
as Levin led a filibuster against missile defense, only a bare
minimum of 40 Democrats enabled him to block the will of a growing
Senate bipartisan majority.
</P>
<P>
   Even within the Clinton Defense Department, support is growing
for deploying the Navy's Aegis fleet air defense system, a step
toward serious missile defense. Secretary Bill Cohen's choice for
chief technical adviser, the former NASA hand Hans Mark, was
welcomed last week by Senate Armed Services as the harbinger of a
new administration attitude toward countering missile dangers.
</P>
<P>
   The center of gravity in the old ``Star Wars'' debate has moved.
Ronald Reagan turns out not to have been deranged on defense _ only
ahead of his time. For those concerned about our new vulnerability,
the trick is not to adopt a nyah-nyah, told-you-so posture, but to
give proponents of the old strategy a graceful exit citing changed
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is absolutely no question the nation will have missile
defense in the future,'' Dr. Jacques Gansler, a top Clinton Defense
official, has said. ``The question is when.''
</P>
<P>
   The threat is here. The money is there. The answer is now.

`HARRY AND THE CANNIBALS': A MAN OF MANY PARTS
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(dc) 
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Pete, Bob and Mary walk into a bar. ``You can't run
around with primates all your life,'' says Pete (Sean Weil),
objecting to Mary's plan to adopt an ape. Mary (Eva Patton) wants
Pete and Bob (Lars Hanson) to be the ape's co-godfathers.
</P>
<P>
   But the guys have other things on their minds. Pete recently had
a liver, kidney, pancreas and partial-intestine transplant, so
naturally he doesn't ``have the guts anymore,'' as he explains, for
his former career as a journalist. Bob recently had a retina
transplant and has given up his career in seismology. Both men,
however, admire Mary's new ears, which she picked up recently at
the Cornell Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   All this transplanting (and there's more) sets up the plot for
``Harry and the Cannibals,'' Susan Mosakowski's pleasant absurdist
one-act play, which continues at La Mama E.T.C. through Sunday. Not
to give too much away, but the Harry of the title is deceased and
he was an organ donor.
</P>
<P>
   The play's bartender-waiter (Greig Sargeant) has an attitude
problem, but so would you if you'd been brought up by a father
named Frank Stein (Raphael Nash Thompson) and special-ordered from
the DuPont Institute of Eugenics.
</P>
<P>
   This group of characters is soon joined by McCoy (Malcolm Adams,
an actor with an infectious Robert Downey Jr. demeanor), a former
mortician who wants to have sex with everyone, anyone, right now.
And they're all soon mesmerized by a mysterious woman in black
(Louise Favier) who has film-noir presence and a secret connection
to Harry.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Baby (David Giambusso), Mary's ape, has learned to
talk but inexplicably speaks Spanish. His first word is ``leche.''
And Dr. Lacuna (Frank Deal), who seems to be all the other
characters' favorite mental-health professional, sneaks moments
alone with his old heart, which he keeps in a jar. Yes, he's a
recent transplant patient, too. Lacuna's leopard-skin
psychiatrist's couch is one of several bright touches in Paula
Longendyke's clever, stylish set.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way to the predictable but cheerfully silly
conclusion, Adams and Ms. Favier capture a few moments of perfect
absurdism. So does Giambusso, usually without speaking. The play's
message _ ``We can't let go of anything; we need all our parts,''
as McCoy says _ seems appropriately pointless.
</P>

<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ For the first time in 20 years, the
government has signaled its willingness to address one of the
sorest points in Indonesia's international relations: the status of
East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday President B.J. Habibie proposed that the territory,
which Indonesia seized by force from Portuguese control in 1975, be
granted a special administrative status, an idea that had been
rejected by his predecessor, Suharto. But Habibie ruled out
independence.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday Justice Minister Muladi announced that 15 East
Timorese political prisoners would be freed, but he said the
territory's independence leader, Xanana Gusmao, would remain in
prison, where he is serving a 20-year sentence for plotting against
the state and possessing illegal weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal for ``special status'' was immediately rejected as
inadequate by separatists who demand total freedom. But in the new
atmosphere of openness that has swept the country since Suharto's
resignation on May 21, Habibie's proposal has touched off a
free-wheeling debate, complete with raucous student demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Ali Alatas, who for years has taken a hard line
on East Timor, said on Tuesday that the departure of Suharto
offered an opportunity to reopen the issue. ``I think now is a good
time to resolve our disagreement under the auspices of the United
Nations secretary general, who has taken the initiative over the
years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Muladi is also taking a moderate position, now calling East
Timor an ``international issue'' and suggesting last month, ``We
should change our position.''
</P>
<P>
   In a scene that would have been impossible under Suharto,
several hundred students marched and chanted Wednesday on a campus
in Dili, the capital of East Timor. Speakers demanded a referendum,
the right to self-determination and a withdrawal of the government
troops who have suppressed a separatist insurgency, often
viciously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bring Suharto to the international court as a war criminal in
East Timor,'' read a poster at the demonstration, which was
attended by several local political figures, including a former
governor, Manuel Viegas Carrascalao.
</P>
<P>
   Government troops, who have broken up student demonstrations by
force in the past, stood by quietly, as they have during a rash of
demonstrations elsewhere in the country since Habibie became
president.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia invaded the former Portuguese colony in 1975 and
annexed it as the nation's 27th province the next year. The move
was condemned by the United Nations, which regards Portugal as the
administrating power.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years Indonesia has poured development funds into the
territory, which is one of its poorest provinces. But it has also
deployed thousands of troops and security officials who have
created an atmosphere of terror. An often brutal separatist
insurgency has battled the government forces, and tens of thousands
of lives have been lost.
</P>
<P>
   The status of East Timor has been the single most difficult
question for Indonesia in international forums. Human rights groups
regularly document government abuses there.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews Tuesday with Reuters and the BBC, Habibie said his
proposal was contingent on an agreement by the United Nations and
Portugal to recognize Indonesian control of the territory and its
800,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   He said autonomy was not an option. ``If you want to discuss it
in that direction, there is no way you can discuss that with me,''
the president said. ``No, we will not let that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia fears that freedom for East Timor would encourage
separatists elsewhere in this sprawling archipelago, particularly
in the provinces of Aceh and Irian Jaya, where guerrilla armies are
also battling the government.
</P>
<P>
   The president's statements were immediately rejected by the
separatist leader Jose Ramos-Horta, who was awarded the 1996 Nobel
Peace Prize. ``This is not a serious proposal, and I am stating
unequivocally that we reject it,'' Ramos-Horta said, speaking by
telephone from Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   The announced plan to free East Timorese prisoners is the latest
in a series of releases of political prisoners that was announced
by Habibie almost immediately after he took office. That
announcement was followed by the extraordinary spectacle of
prisoners giving interviews to reporters inside Cipinang jail, in
Jakarta. Among those interviewed was Gusmao, the symbol of the East
Timorese resistance.

UNANSWERED QUESTIONS IN SHOOTING OF TURKISH RIGHTS ADVOCATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Even after Turkey's most prominent rights
advocate, Akin Birdal, was released from a hospital this week,
questions about who was behind the attempt to kill him remain
unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   Police have arrested six men in connection with the shooting, on
May 12. Birdal has identified two of them as the gunmen who walked
into his Ankara office and shot him in the chest, arm and legs.
</P>
<P>
   Interrogations of the suspected gunmen led detectives to the
other four, one of whom is reported to be a noncommissioned
military officer assigned to a police station in Istanbul. They are
said to have planned the shooting and told the gunmen that Birdal
was a traitor who had to be punished.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish military officers and prosecutors have long asserted
that Birdal and his Human Rights Association maintain ties with
Kurdish guerrillas, a charge he denies. After a senior guerrilla
leader was captured earlier this year, newspapers close to the army
reported that he had named Birdal as a paid guerrilla agent.
</P>
<P>
   Birdal's associates said those reports set the stage for the
attack last month. Before the arrests, Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz
described the shooting as an ``internal settling of accounts''
within pro-guerrilla circles.
</P>
<P>
   According to statements attributed to the two gunmen, however,
the attack was planned by members of shadowy ultranationalist
groups. Ties between these groups and officials of security
agencies have been the subject of widespread speculation for the
last year and a half.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit, speaking after Birdal's
suspected attackers were arrested, said, ``If people, using the
excuse of protecting the state, have put themselves in the place of
the state and have perpetrated this attack or have permitted
someone else to do so, they should know that they are destroying
the state with such extra-judicial executions.''
</P>
<P>
   According to his aides, Birdal has been a defendant in more than
20 criminal cases over the last year, all for statements he made or
for activities of the Human Rights Association. In February he and
other leaders of the association were acquitted on charges of
``incitement'' and ``disseminating separatist propaganda'' that
were filed after they organized a rights conference.
</P>
<P>
   His most recent court appearance came three weeks before he was
shot. Prosecutors asserted that a speech he gave in Rome advocating
a negotiated settlement to the Kurdish conflict constituted
encouragement to terrorists. No verdict has been announced.
</P>
<P>
   In the days after the shooting, thousands of demonstrators took
to the streets in Ankara and Istanbul to repudiate the attack and
show solidarity with the Human Rights Association. They chanted
``Murderer State!'' and carried banners accusing state-sponsored
gangs of involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Birdal himself, however, has been more cautious. ``One should be
careful about saying the attack was linked to the state just
because a sergeant was involved and those who pulled the trigger
were the sons of policemen,'' he told an interviewer before being
wheeled out of his Ankara hospital room on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always see those in front of the curtain,'' he said. ``The
people who put these players on the stage are the real
perpetrators, the directors who wrote the script. When I saw the
attackers I saw only two pawns. Our problem is those who are behind
the stage.''
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen who tried to kill Birdal fired 13 shots, but only six
hit him. Doctors said that they had operated on him several times
and that he will need more treatment for nerve injuries to his left
arm, but that they expect him to recover fully. ``You will see him
walking in a few months,'' one doctor predicted.

MONTINI-COLUMN (Phoenix) - How do you explain Bobby Charles Purcell
in jail, maybe on his way to death row, and Andre Bradley and
Renelyn Simmons in the funeral parlor, on their way to the
cemetery? The system failed. The system (beginital)had (endital) to
fail. That's what I'm hearing. After all, if the system is working,
if the system is doing what it's supposed to do with criminals like
Purcell, then there's no possible way we could end up burying a
couple of bright, talented teenagers. Right? Wrong. By E.J.MONTINI.

CDS: BEFORE NILSSON WAS NILSSON

<TEXT>
<P>
   Last month, Birgit Nilsson turned 80, and it seems clearer than
ever that she was the dominant Wagnerian soprano of the post-World
War II period.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Nilsson moved cautiously in taking on the touchstone
dramatic soprano roles of the German repertory. During the first
decade of her career, she sang mostly Verdi, Strauss, Puccini and
Mozart, and did not attempt Bruennhilde until late 1954, when she
was 36.
</P>
<P>
   What was her voice like before she came to attention outside her
native Sweden? Few recordings exist from her youth, so a new
Bluebell compact disc (ABCD 0750) of Ms. Nilsson in two live
performances with the Swedish Radio Orchestra is of great interest.
</P>
<P>
   One performance, recorded in 1949 when Ms. Nilsson was 30,
presents her in ``The Chinese Flute,'' four songs for soprano and
orchestra by the Danish composer Poul Schierbeck. The concert took
place just weeks after the composer's death at 60. Schierbeck's
tonally grounded, harmonically restless music bears the influence
of his teacher Carl Nielsen. But this work also recalls the
Orient-tinged experiments of Debussy and Ravel.
</P>
<P>
   There is a youthful vulnerability in Ms. Nilsson's singing here
that will surprise those who only know the commanding artist of
later years. Yet the unforced resonance and clarion tone for which
she would become renowned are already present.
</P>
<P>
   Today, a similarly endowed soprano of 30 would already have been
cajoled by impatient impresarios into big Strauss and Wagner roles.
</P>
<P>
   An occasional tremulous quality in Ms. Nilsson's singing
suggests why she was wise to pace herself at this stage: it takes
time to learn to control naturally enormous voices, and Ms. Nilsson
was still learning about hers.
</P>
<P>
   The major offering, recorded in 1953, is ``Bluebeard's Castle,''
Bartok's one-act, two-character opera. This Expressionist work
tells the story of a mysterious old knight and his new young wife
(his fourth), Judith, who is determined to bring light into
Bluebeard's bleak existence by opening the doors, literally, that
contain his secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Bernhard Sonnerstedt, a fine Swedish baritone, sings the title
role in this gripping performance, sung in German, and conducted by
Ferenc Fricsay, a student of Bartok. There are drawbacks: No
libretto is provided, and about 10 minutes of the 60-minute score
are missing, though the cuts are fairly seamless.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Nilsson is the main interest and her voice at 34 sounds
fully settled and gleaming. Clearly, she could have moved in
another direction. But soon the opera world was clamoring for her
Isolde, Electra and Turandot, and she, thank God, obliged.
</P>
<P>
   During the years Birgit Nilsson reigned in the German dramatic
repertory, Joan Sutherland presided similarly over the bel canto
coloratura roles. But the Australian soprano also took chances,
more than she is given credit for.
</P>
<P>
   One came in 1978, when, at 52, she recorded the title role in
Puccini's one-act opera ``Suor Angelica,'' recently released
complete for the first time on London Records (289 458 218-2). Even
with an ideal Puccini soprano in the title role, many opera buffs
find this work weepy and sentimental, with its story of a girl from
an aristocratic family who has given birth to a child out of
wedlock and been sent, for life, to a convent. Ms. Sutherland's
refulgent sound and grandeur would seem all wrong for the role.
</P>
<P>
   Yet she delivers a fascinating performance, lyrically expansive
and, in places, surprisingly passionate. Her trademark reserve is
also evident, but here it actually helps to temper the emotive
excess of the score, allowing its musical elegance and dramatic
honesty to come through.
</P>
<P>
   In this regard, the cool conducting of Richard Bonynge, not a
typical Puccinian, is a plus. He elicits a supple performance from
the National Philharmonic Orchestra. The great German mezzo-soprano
Christa Ludwig, also stepping outside her usual repertory, is
unforgettable as Sister Angelica's imperious aunt.
</P>
<P>
   The American baritone Thomas Hampson has taken chances in his
career, too. But a new EMI Classics recording (7243 5 56443)
presents him in repertory he is ideally suited to: Mahler's
``Kindertotenlieder,'' the ``Ruckert Lieder'' and one song from
``Das Lied von der Erde.'' Hampson previously recorded these works
(except for ``Das Lied'') with Leonard Bernstein and the Vienna
Philharmonic. But here he performs them with their original piano
accompaniments, played by the musicianly Wolfram Rieger.
</P>
<P>
   Many Mahlerites consider the piano versions of these songs as
the composer's sketches for the familiar versions with orchestra.
But there are advantages to the originals: The contrapuntal
textures are clearer, and the impact of Mahler's inspired text
setting is more vivid.
</P>
<P>
   Hampson's performance is intelligent and handsomely vocalized,
especially the high pianissimo phrases, which are sung with aching
beauty. To hear the gentle, tinkling orchestral music from the
final section of ``In diesem Wetter'' performed with unmannered
simplicity on the piano, as if on some wind-up music box, makes
these unbearably tragic songs about the death of children almost
comforting.

H.F. MCCARTY JR., 76, POULTRY ENTREPRENEUR
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

   H.F. McCarty Jr., a Mississippi entrepreneur who transformed a
feed and seed store into one of the United States' biggest poultry
operations, died of heart failure on Saturday at his home in Magee,
Miss., his son, John, said. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his business activities, McCarty, who was known
as Mac, was an active and generous supporter of a wide range of
educational institutions in his native state.
</P>
<P>
   He established scholarships at most of Mississippi's major
universities, donating money to historically black colleges like
Jackson State University and endowing professorships at the
University of Mississippi, Millsaps College and Rust College.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mac loved to make money, but he liked to make it because he
liked to give it away,'' said George Harmon, president of Millsaps
College, where McCarty was a lifetime trustee.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Ovett, Miss., during the Depression, McCarty was raised
by two great-aunts, Annie and Birdie McCarty, who managed the
family business, McCarty &AMP; Co., in Collins, Miss., as well as a
600-acre farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got all of his enterprise from the two aunts who raised
him,'' John McCarty said.
</P>
<P>
   A career in business was not foremost on McCarty's mind in his
early years.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from the University of Mississippi and service
in the Army Air Corps in World War II, McCarty earned an master's
degree in history at the University of South Carolina and had
aspirations of becoming either a lawyer or an academic.
</P>
<P>
   In 1947, however, after spending a year and a half at the
University of Mississippi School of Law, McCarty's father asked his
son to join the family feed and seed business. He chose to give up
a legal career, and in February 1948 opened a second store in
nearby Magee.
</P>
<P>
   Within a year McCarty's store was on solid footing. But he saw
better growth prospects in the poultry business, and in 1949 bought
a small hatchery, supplying chicks and feed to farmers in the
surrounding area.
</P>
<P>
   The business flourished in the 1950s and 1960s, and by the
mid-1970s McCarty Farms Inc. was well on the way to becoming a
vertically integrated poultry producer, with direct control over
the selection, growth and processing of the chickens that it
marketed. In 1981, the company established McCarty Foods and became
a further processor of broiled meat.
</P>
<P>
   With his son, John, and daughter, Marsha McCarty Wells, in key
positions, by the mid-1990s McCarty had built the business into one
of the Mississippi's largest employers, with more than 4,000
employees and contracts with more than 400 independent chicken
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, McCarty Farms had sales of more than $300 million. A
year later the closely held company was sold to Tyson Foods Inc.
for an undisclosed price.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his philanthropic work for Mississippi's schools
and colleges, McCarty was also a devoted supporter of the United
Methodist Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lived a life of quiet service,'' said Robert Khayat,
chancellor of the University of Mississippi. ``From humble
beginnings, he built a wonderfully successful business and
throughout his life placed an important emphasis on philanthropy.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarty is survived by his wife, the former Mary Ann Henry, of
Magee; three daughters, Patti Sullivan of Jackson, Miss., Katherine
Flint of Flowood, Miss., and Marsha Wells of Ridgeland, Miss.; a
son, John, of Jackson; five sisters, Lunita Badgerow of Detroit,
Jane Haman of Atlanta, and Margaret Ann Crawley, Frankie McCarty
and Mary McNair, all of Magee; 11 grandchildren, and two
great-grandchildren.

RESENDING FOR SAN BERNARDINO SUN

<P>
   There are plans and then there are Master plans. Julie Rousseau
is riding the wave of the latter.
</P>
<P>
   The spiritual coach of the Los Angeles Sparks owes her lofty job
to a Higher Source. In hindsight, she can track the sequence of
events that prepared her for this day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I an overnight success? No,'' Rousseau answered her own
question emphatically. ``For nine years I've worked on perfecting
my craft. It's not perfect, no where near perfect. I'm constantly
learning, but that's the whole beauty of the game is that you're
constantly learning. I had no idea that the Lord was actually
preparing me for this role.''
</P>
<P>
   At 33, she is the youngest coach in the WNBA. Rousseau was
promoted from assistant to interim head coach to replace Linda
Sharp after the Sparks begin the inaugural WNBA season 4-7.
</P>
<P>
   The change was swift and abrupt and the results were immediate.
The Sparks finished the rest of the season 10-7, one victory shy of
the Western Conference title and a playoff berth. But that was just
one of the effects that surfaced. Clearly, the most apparent change
came in the players attitude. They stopped making excuses for their
obvious lack of intensity to being invigorated by Rousseau's aura.
</P>
<P>
   Management was pleased and offered the Los Angeles native a
three-year contract. By all accounts it was a good move by the
Sparks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was really tough,'' guard Tamecka Dixon said.
``Julie did a great job of coming in and instilling confidence that
was lost. She pumped us up every time, even when we did something
wrong she was there pumping up the good thing that we did, maybe
the play before or whatever. I think that really, really helped us.
The level of respect that the players have for her; she's a
motivator, and people want to play for her. They want to go out and
make the big play so that they can look on the sideline and see her
smiling.''
</P>
<P>
   Her motivational skills are highly regarded, guard Penny Toler
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing at this level is what coach can motivate
their players the most,'' said Toler, an All-American from Long
Beach State. ``You can be talented, but still if you don't have the
motivation from the bench, the confidence; when you look over to
the side and you have the confidence in your coach it makes a
difference. I know me, as a player, I feel confident with Julie.''
</P>
<P>
   Up until a couple of years ago there were no women pro leagues
in the United States (now there are two), so Rousseau never
visualized herself in this position. But through the Say No
Classic, the brainchild of Sparks general manager Rhonda Windham,
and other summer league tournaments, Rousseau had the opportunity
to coach both college and pro athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I've been quote unquote kind of grooming her,''
said Windham, who has known Rousseau since 1989. ``Anytime I had
any type of pro, all-star or any type of game, I always had Julie
coach a team for me. Because she's good, she's knowledgeable, the
players respected her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's such a hard worker. She would do everything in her power
to prepare herself which would in turn prepare the players. She's
committed to basketball, she has a passion for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rousseau dreamt of becoming a college coach one day, but when
opportunity arose, her ``heart and focus'' was committed to
Washington Prep High where she coached since 1989 and won three
L.A. City championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``When this opportunity came as an assistant coach, I just
wanted to learn and go back to my high school kids and teach them
some new stuff and try to win a state championship,'' Rousseau
said.
</P>
<P>
   Now she's committed to winning a WNBA championship. She spent
the offseason studying and researching on how to execute her job.
But it's not work with Rousseau, it's a labor of love.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having a lot of fun. I love it. I really do. Every day's a
challenge,'' Rousseau said. ``At night I'm dreaming of things,
really, literally. I go through the day's practice in my head and
I'm like, `Yeh, we need to do this, we need to do that tomorrow.'
This team is a constant, not battle, but reflection every day.
Reflecting on what we've done and what we need to do. It's all
apart of being in tune, even in the shower.''
</P>
<P>
   SPARKS NOTES:
</P>

SCIENTISTS CRACK GENETIC CODE OF TUBERCULOSIS BACTERIUM 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By NICHOLAS WADE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists have broken the code of the tuberculosis bacterium, a
germ that kills more people in the world than any other infectious
agent.
</P>
<P>
   The advance, which is being published Thursday in the journal
Nature, is the work of a team led by Dr. Stewart Cole, a
tuberculosis expert at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, and Dr. Bart
Barrell, a DNA sequencer at the Sanger Centre near Cambridge,
England.
</P>
<P>
   The team succeeded in decoding the 4,411,529 chemical letters
that constitute the genome, or DNA sequence, of Mycobacterium
tuberculosis, as the microbe is known. Working out the structure of
so enormous an DNA molecule lies at the edge of what is technically
possible. About a dozen bacterial genomes have been sequenced since
1995, only one of them larger than that of tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
   This advance is likely to open up new approaches for developing
drugs and vaccines against the microbe, and to reinvigorate
research efforts in what has been up to now a difficult and slow
moving field.
</P>
<P>
   The success comes none too soon. Tuberculosis is a deadly
disease in the less developed world, killing three million people a
year, according to the World Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, where it has long been treatable with
antibiotics, public health officials were concerned when
drug-resistant strains emerged several years ago that the disease
would become uncontrollable again. The outbreak of these novel
forms has been contained, but tuberculosis is no longer regarded
with complacency.
</P>
<P>
   The bacterium is inhaled and is usually contained within the
lungs by the body's immune system. There it may lurk harmlessly for
years, until the immune system is weakened by age, stress or
disease. Then the bacterium erupts, eating through the tissues of
the lungs and occasional blood vessels, making the patient cough up
alarming displays of blood.
</P>
<P>
   Possession of the bacterium's DNA sequence is like acquiring an
enemy's battle plan. The sequence encodes every genetic defense and
stratagem the bacterium has acquired in the course of evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Though full analysis of the sequence will take years, the
Pasteur-Sanger Centre team has already discerned that the sequence
encodes about 4,000 separate genes and has divined how some of them
may assist the microbe at different stages of its cunning life
cycle.
</P>
<P>
   About 400 of these genes, for example, belong to a previously
unrecognized genetic family. Their purpose may be to help the
bacterium change its outer coat, staying one step ahead of the
attacks mounted against it by the body's immune system.
</P>
<P>
   Another large set of genes is devoted to making fat-related
chemicals known as lipids. These may be the key to sealing the
bacterium's membrane and enabling it to survive for years while it
waits for a weak spot to emerge in the immune system's defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Barry Bloom, a tuberculosis expert at the Albert Einstein
College of Medicine in the Bronx, said the genome would have ``a
major effect in accelerating ongoing work in terms of identifying
the genes required for virulence and targets for drugs and
vaccines.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lee Reichman, director of the National Tuberculosis Center
in Newark, N.J., said he hoped the genome would stimulate drug
companies to devise less draconian ways of treating the disease
than the present six months of intensive drug therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bloom and Reichman have been critical of the lack of public
funding for tuberculosis research and believe that availability of
the genome will bring new zest to the field.
</P>
<P>
   But even the genome sequencing project looked for a time as if
it would be another fumble with two rival teams duplicating each
other's work. The Wellcome Trust, a large medical philanthropy in
London, decided to fund the Sanger Centre team to sequence the
tuberculosis genome starting in March 1996.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later the National Institutes of Health, which had
been unsuccessful in an earlier attempt, approved funding for the
Institute of Genomic Research in Rockville, Md., to also sequence
the tuberculosis genome. The institute's director, Dr. J. Craig
Venter, was the first to sequence a bacterial genome in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Claire Fraser, the institute's vice president for research,
said the NIH decided to go ahead ``since the Wellcome Trust hadn't
completed a genome and the NIH didn't want to put their eggs in
another failed basket, as it were.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sanger Centre has won the race since the Institute of
Genomic Research is a month away from closing the gaps in its
sequence and then has further checking to do.
</P>
<P>
   Barrell, asked how he felt to have beaten the usually very
competitive Venter, said diplomatically that he was happy to finish
first ``but coming in second is sometimes a bigger prize because
you can make all the comparisons,'' meaning that the differences
between the two laboratories sequences will be of high scientific
interest.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid direct duplication, the two teams chose to study
different strains of the tuberculosis bacterium. The Sanger Centre
chose a strain that has been studied in the laboratory for many
years, while the Institute for Genomic Research picked an unusually
infectious strain that had recently caused an outbreak in a
children's clothing factory in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   A worker with the strain infected most of his family members and
many of his fellow workers, despite the most casual contact with
them.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser said that the two strains were proving to be very
different, with changes in every 5,000 units of DNA on average.
Since the clothing factory strain is highly infectious and the
laboratory strain is not, the differences between the two genomes
should help pinpoint exactly which genes account for the
infectivity.
</P>
<P>
   Barrell and Fraser both said the tuberculosis genome had proved
particularly hard to sequence, in part because of the many regions
in which the same string of chemical letters is repeated. These
repetitive strings have the higher purpose of protecting the
bacterium against its host's immune system.
</P>
<P>
   Repetitive DNA confuses the machinery that translates genetic
instructions into proteins. Since the repetitive regions seem to be
in the genes for the bacterium's coat proteins, the effect is to
change the composition of the coat at regular intervals. The coat
proteins are the target of the body's immune system, which is
thrown into disarray each time the target shifts.
</P>
<P>
   The tuberculosis strain that infects humans seems to have split
away some 10,000 years ago from the strain that infects cattle.
Since this is about the time that cattle were domesticated, the
human disease can be seen as a consequence of that agricultural
revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Plans are under way to sequence the cattle version of
tuberculosis, as well as another closely related bacterium, which
causes human leprosy. &QL;

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With a mixture of pride and puzzlement, Alan
Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, declared the economy to be
in extraordinarily good shape Wednesday and signaled to investors
that he saw no immediate need to strike against inflation by
raising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current economic performance, with its combination of
strong growth and low inflation, is as impressive as any I have
witnessed in my near half-century of daily observation of the
American economy,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve chairman sprinkled his two hours of
testimony before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress with
caveats about how the combination of low unemployment and strong
growth could eventually force the central bank to raise rates. But
he emphasized that price pressures were subdued and that Asia's
financial crisis was already working to take some of the steam out
of the American economy.
</P>
<P>
   Just as he has in other public statements over the last several
years, Greenspan spoke optimistically about several economic
developments, including his belief that the nation was benefiting
from huge investments in technology that were helping companies
produce more for every hour worked, holding down overall costs even
as wages rise. And he pointed to a ``virtuous cycle'' in which low
inflation had reduced interest rates and stimulated more investment
and consumption.
</P>
<P>
   And in what has become a familiar refrain for investors in the
stock market, Greenspan said expectations of stronger earnings had
``driven stock prices sharply higher and credit spreads lower,
perhaps to levels that will be difficult to sustain unless economic
conditions remain exceptionally favorable.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's less direct but more explosive warning about the
danger of ``irrational exuberance'' spooked the markets when he
first suggested the market might be overvalued a year and a half
ago. But investors largely shrugged off his concerns Wednesday _
although reports late in the day from some big American companies
about likely earnings weakness because of the Asian turmoil jolted
the markets.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has Greenspan's fretfulness about the market become old
news to investors as they have pushed the market higher, but Wall
Street is convinced that the Federal Reserve has little leeway to
raise rates anyway because of its concerns about the fragility of
Asian markets and economies. Underscoring those worries, stock
markets fell sharply Wednesday in Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea
and other nations, largely because of concern that the plummeting
value of the Japanese yen could further harm the region's
economies.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, bond prices rose sharply Wednesday, with
Greenspan's comments extending a rally set off when investors in
Asian markets sought a safe refuge in U.S. Treasury securities.
After being up much of the day, stock prices ended lower, dragged
down in part by a warning from Boeing Co., the nation's biggest
exporter, that weak demand for airliners from Asia would cut into
its profits.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In his testimony, Greenspan suggested that the risks to the
American economy remained balanced between an Asia-induced slowdown
and an inflationary overheating fueled by the surging stock market
and strong demand.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan said the Fed remained uncertain about whether Asia was
stabilizing or whether further economic deterioration there could
wash up in the United States later this year.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he said, there were signs that consumer price
inflation might be picking up from extremely low levels. And
without saying so explicitly, he suggested that a continued run-up
in the stock market could fuel excess demand and inflationary
pressures.
</P>
<P>
   But he said there was almost no evidence of the phenomenon that
central bankers fear most _ wage and price increases feeding off
each other and creating inflationary pressures that can only be
squelched by higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, at least, the adverse wage-price interactions
that played so central a role in pushing inflation higher in many
past business expansions _eventually bringing those expansions to
an end _ do not appear to have gained a significant toehold in the
current expansion,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   The Asia crisis, a slowdown or reversal in the rise of corporate
earnings and a reversal of the inventory buildup of the last
several quarters could all help slow the economy to a sustainable
pace, Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan was careful to say that he would be as vigilant as
ever in looking for early warnings signs of broad-based wage and
price increases, especially with unemployment at a 28-year low of
4.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``If developments such as these do not bring labor demand into
line with its sustainable supply, tighter economic policy may be
necessary to help guard against a buildup of pressures that could
derail the current prosperity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the optimistic tone of Greenspan's testimony put him at odds
with a small group of inflation hawks on the central bank's
policy-making committee who have been agitating for a rate increase
now. Led by Jerry Jordan, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank
of Cleveland, they have been arguing that heading off inflation
down the road requires striking now, even if there is little
evidence of current price pressure. The Fed next meets to consider
interest rate policy on June 30 and July 1, and economists say it
is now extremely unlikely that the Fed would raise rates then.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan mused at several points during his testimony about how
the old rules and assumptions about the interplay between growth,
inflation and unemployment did not seem to be holding up _ although
he quickly added that he did not know if they had been permanently
retired or just set aside by a confluence of temporary factors.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that economic performance strengthened as inflation
subsided should not have been surprising, given that risk premiums
and economic disincentives to invest in productive capital diminish
as product prices become more stable,'' he said. ``But the extent
to which strong growth and high resource utilization have been
joined with low inflation over an extended period is nevertheless
extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the strong economic performance, Greenspan said,
is an apparent pickup in the growth rate of productivity, or the
measure of output per worker per period of time worked.
</P>
<P>
   A steep and largely unexplained decline in productivity growth
since the early 1970s has been the main brake on economic growth in
the United States, and economists have been debating for several
years whether heavy investments in computers and other technology
have turned the trend around. Greenspan said there is mounting
evidence that productivity gains are growing, although the extent
of the improvement remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Signs of a major technological transformation are all around
us, and the benefits are evident not only in high-tech industries
but also in production processes that have long been part of our
industrial economy,'' Greenspan said.

MARKET PLACE: THE YEN HAS ONE DIRECTION _ DOWN
</HEADLINE>
   (dc) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The yen must fall. Even further than it has.
</P>
<P>
   So say several veteran Japan-watchers. While economists argue
about when and how the Japanese government might act to reverse the
nation's economic slide, they say that even if the government takes
decisive action, the yen will still plunge.
</P>
<P>
   Severe weakness in the yen's exchange value has already taken it
from 135.5 yen to the dollar a month ago to 141.43 late Wednesday,
a 4.4 percent decline. And the Japanese central bank increasingly
appears incapable of stopping the plunge. ``I don't think an
intervention by the Bank of Japan, even a massive one, can reverse
the slide,'' said David Horner, a senior financial strategist with
Merrill Lynch in New York. ``The worst is yet to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Horner expects Japan's central bank to try to prop up the
currency soon. But he expects any intervention to be modest
compared with the $25 billion yen-buying spree by the Bank of Japan
at the Easter weekend. The threat of another intervention has so
far been successful, keeping currency traders on guard and
speculators reined in. It has also helped make the yen's four-week
fall a smooth drop, not a disruptive one.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the currency may rebound here and there, but the
long-term outlook seems grim indeed. Horner says the yen could fall
within eight weeks to a rate of 148 against the dollar, a 5 percent
decline from Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Others agreed. ``Japan is in depression,'' said Robert Parks, a
former Wall Street economist and a professor of finance at the
Lubin Graduate School of Business at Pace University in New York.
``And the Japanese are not taking effective action to get out of
depression.''
</P>
<P>
   If Japan reports Friday that the economy contracted again in the
first quarter, as is expected, economists will characterize it
officially as in recession.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing Japan must do to give its economy some lift,
Parks argued, is to increase demand at home. The current lack of
demand shows up in several ways. In May, Japanese wholesale prices
fell by 2.3 percent from their level a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Another measure is inventories. Even considering that Japanese
companies normally carry two and a half times as much inventory for
each unit of output as American companies do, the inventories
overhanging the Japanese economy today is staggering at 22.5
percent above the average level in the 1980s. Corporate inventories
are now double the level of their last peak in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not easy to increase the demand for goods and services
in a country where the working population is declining by one-half
of 1 percent annually. According to Andrew Smithers of the economic
advisory firm Smithers &AMP; Company in London, ``Even if Japan is very
successful, if its productivity paced the rest of the world and it
had a higher growth in the standard of living than the rest of the
world, it will still grow slower than everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   The result? Japan must stimulate its economy by cutting taxes
and spending more on public works projects that are not
boondoggles. And, Parks argued, the central bank must finance these
projects with money fresh off the printing presses. If the bank did
not create new money and instead sold debt to pay for the projects,
it would merely sop up funds that might otherwise go to investment
or consumption.
</P>
<P>
   But revving up the printing presses is something the Japanese
are loath to do. For one, it goes against a monetary policy in
place since 1990. Japan's money-supply growth, running about 4
percent last year, has come down from 20 percent in the early 1970s
and 9 percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Printing money is also deemed inflationary by the Japanese and
therefore deeply feared. Creating a fresh supply of yen would also
push the currency's value down further.
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies the Scylla and Charybdis aspect of the Japanese
situation. If the government were to let the budget deficit run
bigger than this year's estimated 3.8 percent of the gross domestic
product, the yen's value would fall. If the government did nothing,
it would fall as well. ``The yen is tumbling either way,'' Parks
said. ``There's no bottom to a currency in the middle of a
depression.''
</P>
<P>
   A tumbling yen could be expected to cause another bloodletting
among the already wan Asian economies. A serious downward spiral in
currencies in Indonesia, South Korea, Thailand and other Asian
countries would likely be even more damaging than the devaluations
there last fall.
</P>
<P>
   That's because in 1997, most of these countries were still
showing growth in their economic output. Now, they are not. China,
which is growing, albeit slowly, is voicing its concerns to
Washington about the free-falling yen.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a sharply declining yen would devastate Japanese
stocks, already down more than 7 percent this year. Conclusion:
Investors buying into the Japanese market in the belief that it is
the bargain basement may soon learn that they are nowhere near the
cellar.

   JERSEY CITY, N.J. _ On the night after Frank Sinatra died, Jimmy
Roselli, the other Italian-American singer from Monroe Street in
Hoboken, was starting his first three-night gig of the year at
Caesars Atlantic City. All day long, the news was Sinatra, Sinatra,
Sinatra. But at Caesar's Circus Maximus Theatre, the audience was
all Jimmy's.
</P>
<P>
   It was a mature crowd, dressed for cocktails, seated at
white-clothed tables and hanging on the singer's every note. Not a
glass was tinkled. Not a throat was cleared. No one seemed to
breathe. Finally, at the middle of his set, after he had belted his
signature torch song, ``Mala Femmena,'' and moved his stool to the
edge of the stage to be that much closer to the audience, the rabid
fans broke loose. People were hollering and whistling. ``Cante,
Jimmy!'' ``Jimmy you're the greatest!'' ``Jimmy you're mine!''
</P>
<P>
   This happens to him all the time. It has been happening for 30
or 40 years. But the 72-year-old crooner never seems to get used to
it. He squinted into the audience, then glanced over to his
orchestra, as if the hoots and hollers might be for the trumpet
section. ``OK,'' he said, shrugging. ``I'm yours. What else you
want me to say?''
</P>
<P>
   It's in moments like that (and this: ``If we didn't rehearse it,
you're not gonna hear it,'' he said when fans shouted requests),
that Jimmy Roselli sounds an awful lot like you-know-who. Roselli,
who can still hit the high notes and who sells out Caesars just
about every single time he performs here in the spring, summer and
fall, has been The Other Singer From Hoboken for so long that he
has gotten used to it.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say he likes it. ``Are we gonna talk about Sinatra
or we gonna talk about me?'' he said, sitting on his leather couch
in the brick house overlooking his hometown where he lives with his
wife Donna. Still, Roselli, a favorite singer of generations of
Italian-Americans and all the big wiseguys (he sang his best-loved
song, ``Little Pal,'' at John Gotti Jr.'s wedding) expects to face
lots more Sinatra comparisons _ or, more likely, the same ones,
over and over _ in the near future. After 32 albums, the one
big-time singer from Hoboken who never really left is getting his
turn to shine far and wide.
</P>
<P>
   A biography, ``Making the Wiseguys Weep: The Jimmy Roselli
Story,'' by David Evanier (Farrar, Straus and Giroux) is due in the
stores later this year, and Roselli has promised to sit for
interviews to promote it. Not to mention a screenplay, commissioned
by Touchstone Pictures and John Travolta's production company, is
in the works, with Travolta interested in starring as the singer.
(So what if Jimmy Roselli looks more like Danny Thomas and would
prefer his pal, Joe Pesci, to play him?)
</P>
<P>
   Is he excited? ``Don't you think it's kind of pathetic for
someone to be getting noticed when they're 72 years old? Or by the
time the book comes out, 73?'' He slumped down into the sofa,
suddenly smaller, with a deep sigh. His wife, 20 years his junior,
and his two other best friends in the world, Pete Cavallo and Jimmy
Geritano, were sitting around him, fidgeting nervously, wondering
if the grumpy Roselli was about to surface. ``When you've had a lot
of hard luck like Jimmy has, you become a little hardened,'' Mrs.
Roselli said, filling the silence. ``He's had hard luck since he
was born. His mother died at childbirth and his father abandoned
him, and his grandfather was a longshoreman who was away a lot.
Jimmy has had a lot of bad luck.''
</P>
<P>
   It was just his luck to be born a songbird in the same town as
the singer who would transform pop music. Jimmy Roselli grew up
half a block from Frank Sinatra (his grandfather and Frank's father
were best friends), sang the same type of songs (even some of the
same songs), traveled in the same circles. They couldn't stand each
other.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not just because one became a megastar and the other
didn't. (Or hasn't.) Roselli often turned down chances at wide
fame. ``Tell them the time you walked off the Merv Griffin Show,''
Cavallo said fondly. ``Or the time you turned down Regis and Kathie
Lee and all the other shows,'' Mrs. Roselli added.
</P>
<P>
   Most famously, he quit a seven-show stint on the Ed Sullivan
Show after three nights. (''They didn't pay enough.'') But that was
his doing. The Roselli-Sinatra feud was born, as Jimmy Roselli
tells it, when Sinatra had Roselli's records blacklisted from radio
stations.
</P>
<P>
   The story goes that Dolly Sinatra, Frank's mother, asked a
friend to ask Roselli to perform in a charity show, as he had done
for her on other occasions. But Roselli was offended that she
hadn't asked her himself, and said so. Frank Sinatra, Roselli says,
took his response as an insult and used his power to get his music
blackballed.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is that after that, the radio stations stopped
playing my music,'' he said. His biographer, Evanier, says the
story has some merit. ``It can't be proven,'' he said. ``But it
can't be misproven. Radio stations did stop playing his songs at
that time. WNEW (in New York) stopped playing him totally.''
</P>
<P>
   And other incidents bear out the theory. ``There was a time the
Italian-American Anti-Defamation League was doing an event at
Madison Square Garden,'' Evanier said. ``Joe Colombo asked Jimmy to
be the star. But Sinatra came in.'' Sinatra's ground rules had
Roselli and Jimmy Durante, who was Roselli's good friend, doing 10
minutes and Sinatra singing for however long he wanted. Roselli
said no, and infuriated Colombo, who had him blacklisted from clubs
and theaters and jukeboxes, Evanier said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happened with Frank Sinatra, Jimmy Roselli's friends
know that the singer blessed with a two-octave range often damns
his own success. He does nine shows a year at Caesars Atlantic City
(the next are at the end of July) for $1.8 million, but has turned
down the same amount for the same number of shows elsewhere. Not to
mention that he refuses to do compilation albums of songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been trying to get him to put some songs on one CD,''
Pete Cavallo said. ``He does the most beautiful rendition of
``Somewhere Over the Rainbow.'''
</P>
<P>
   Grudgingly, Roselli let his friend put the song on his elaborate
stereo. As the room listened raptly, Roselli paced impatiently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shouldn't he put this on a special CD?'' Cavallo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whadda I need to do that for?'' Roselli said. ``I got enough
albums.''

MEXICO PROTESTS HANDLING OF MONEY-LAUNDERING STING BY U.S. AGENTS

<TEXT>
<P>
   On a Saturday night in May, some accused Mexican drug
traffickers and their banker friends strolled out of a casino in
Mesquite, Nev., piled into limousines, and set off for what was to
be a wild night of women at a desert brothel called ``The Chicken
Ranch.''
</P>
<P>
   When they were quickly arrested in an elaborately choreographed
sting that reached from San Diego to Aruba, it concluded one of the
most ambitious undercover campaigns that U.S. law-enforcement
agents have ever waged against Latin American drug cartels.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a month later, however, the three-year investigation
appears likely to make history less for the 167 arrests and the
scope of the drug-money laundering system that it smashed than for
the extraordinary diplomatic uproar it has inspired.
</P>
<P>
   According to senior officials from both countries, the battle
has brought to a head what has been a lengthy, bitter and
behind-the-scenes struggle over how U.S. law-enforcement agents
will be allowed to work in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly five years after Mexico and the United States forged a
partnership under the North American Free Trade Agreement, the
furor has underscored both the resilience of Mexico's nationalist
sensitivities on law-enforcement matters and the U.S. government's
stubborn mistrust of Mexico's criminal-justice apparatus.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of things that we have not accepted and that
we are not going to accept,'' said Mexican Foreign Minister Rosario
Green. ``We Mexicans are very jealous of our national
sovereignty.''
</P>
<P>
   Angered at what they view as the trampling of criminal laws and
diplomatic rule by undercover agents working in Mexico, Mexican
officials say they may prosecute the Americans for enticing the
jailed bankers to commit crimes. U.S. officials say Mexico has also
proposed that law-enforcement cooperation between the two countries
could be suspended if such operations take place again without
their consent.
</P>
<P>
   So frustrated have Clinton administration officials grown during
more than a year of secret negotiations over what protection will
be accorded U.S. law-enforcement agents assigned to Mexico that
Attorney General Janet Reno recently told Ms. Green that the United
States may pull most of its drug-enforcement agents out of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the Americans have abandoned hopes of gaining formal
authorization for the agents to carry guns, as they have done
informally for years. Instead, the United States is pushing for
broader diplomatic immunity, something Mexican officials have
steadfastly opposed.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials describe the possibility of a mass withdrawal of
drug agents as remote, given the likelihood that Mexico would only
allow them to return under more restrictive terms.
</P>
<P>
   But they also acknowledge that the Drug Enforcement
Administration has already pulled back two teams of agents who
recently came under threat from drug traffickers in the two main
cocaine-transit cities along the border, Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When the arrests were announced in May, with the indictment of
officials from 12 Mexican banks unsealed in Los Angeles, Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin and Reno hailed the the action as ``the
largest, most comprehensive drug-money laundering case in the
history of U.S. law-enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   According to interviews with almost two dozen U.S. and Mexican
officials, the case began after Customs Service agents in Los
Angeles noticed a new currency in the shadowy financial world
through which Latin America's biggest drug organizations move and
hide their money.
</P>
<P>
   Big Mexican bank drafts, drawn on the dollar accounts that
Mexico's newly privatized banks keep in the United States, were
becoming instruments of choice.
</P>
<P>
   By 1994, Customs agents determined that drug profits in the
United States were being wired through U.S. banks or shipped in
bulk back to Mexico, where Mexican bankers, charging a one or two
percent commission, would issue drafts in dollars. In a stroke, the
dealers and the bankers created a highly-liquid currency that was
hard to trace. Drug traffickers could choose between cashing the
drafts, redepositing them or swapping them for, say, Colombian
pesos with a legitimate businessmen who might then use the dollars
to buy goods in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Customs agents began to infiltrate the system by using
undetected pieces of a successful operation they had set up against
Colombian drug dealers years earlier _ a phony business near Los
Angeles, old drug connections and experienced covert operatives.
</P>
<P>
   The basic idea, one agents said, was to ``play it again.''
Recalling Ingrid Bergman's famous line from the 1942 film, they
named the operation ``Casablanca.''
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the scheme, agents said, was an extraordinary
``cooperating informant,''a man whom the drug traffickers and their
bankers know as an urbane, enterprising Colombian money launderer
named ``Javier Ramirez.''
</P>
<P>
   Working with an undercover team of Customs agents and police
detectives, Ramirez, a protected federal witness whose identity
remains secret, entertained traffickers at the warehouse offices of
the front company outside Los Angeles; flew them to Las Vegas on a
private jet; even visited them in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry concentrated initially on money launderers
associated with Colombia's Cali cartel. But the agents' focus
shifted in November of 1995, when they were dispatched by Cali
operatives to a routine money pick up outside of Chicago.

CAN NEW SACAJAWEA COIN GIVE THOSE DEAD PRESIDENTS A RUN FOR THEIR
MONEY?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY BINGHAM 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the first time in decades, the feds are changing our change.
</P>
<P>
   Coming soon to a bank near you is a newfangled $20. But as soon
as you're accustomed to the new bill, expect more change: A new
dollar coin to replace the infamous Susan B. Anthony.
</P>
<P>
   A Congress-appointed committee met Monday and Tuesday in
Philadelphia, and after much polite debate, decided which famous
female will adorn the new dollar coin. Ladies and gentlemen, empty
your pockets for ... Sacajawea.
</P>
<P>
   Philip N. Diehl, director of America's coinmaker, the U.S. Mint,
said the new coin will depict ``Liberty represented by a Native
American woman and inspired by Sacajawea.'' (That's
``sack-a-juh-WEE-uh,'' if you don't remember from Social Studies.)
</P>
<P>
   Diehl's nine-person committee met because in December, Congress
told them to. With the stock of Susan B.'s running out, the time
had come for another coin. Susan's was such a stinker that
moneymakers were glad to have another chance.
</P>
<P>
   Congress gave the Dollar Coin Design Advisory Committee its
marching orders: Make the new coin gold-colored (so it won't be
confused with the quarter); give it a distinctive edge (so it won't
be confused with a quarter); and put a woman on the head side (make
that a deceased woman, thank you).
</P>
<P>
   That meant all the country music fans who suggested Dolly Parton
were out of luck. That left Martha Washington to square off with
Pocahontas; Betsy Ross to take on the first female governor, Nellie
Ross. The rules eliminated all but roughly 25 suggestions, gleaned
from the U.S. Mint's Web site, from public telephone calls and
letters and from sidewalk conversations with committee members.
</P>
<P>
   After two days in the great halls of Philadelphia, the
runners-up were abolitionist Sojourner Truth; Underground Railroad
founder Harriet Tubman; former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt; and a
surprise candidate, early African-American aviator Bessie Coleman.
The two finalists turned out to be Sacajawea, tour guide to
explorers Lewis and Clark; and Liberty, the lady of statue fame.
</P>
<P>
   When the discussion was over, they both won. The camp that
rooted for Liberty, the allegorical candidate, convinced the others
that Americans have a long tradition of Liberty on their coins. The
camp pulling for a real woman, Sacajawea, convinced their opponents
of the great contributions of Native American women. With six in
favor, one opposed and one abstaining _ and no flipping for it _ a
decision was made.
</P>
<P>
   But Sacajawea might have had an edge. The Shoshone Indian
recently showed up in Ken Burns' PBS documentary about Lewis and
Clark, and before that, she appeared on bookshelves in Stephen
Ambrose's bestselling story of the expedition, ``Undaunted
Courage.'' Poor Pocahontas hasn't made NPR or the ``Today'' show
since the Disney movie.
</P>
<P>
   From here, the committee will submit its ``design concept'' to
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin. He'll OK it, then ship it off to
artists who'll get busy drawing. We won't hold a new dollar coin
for a couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever she looks like, things don't bode well for Sacajawea.
Modern history is littered with money that didn't quite make it.
</P>
<P>
   The most maligned is the Susan B. Anthony. Hers is the reason
we're getting a new dollar coin. ``The lesson of the Susan B.
Anthony, and the lack of popular acceptance of the aesthetics,
weighed heavily on the committee,'' Diehl said. ``They very much
wanted an aesthetic design that was simple in execution, that would
not be too cluttered, because this is a small coin, but also
reflected traditional American values, and presented a role model
for young men and young women.''
</P>
<P>
   Minted between 1979 and 1981, the Susan B. seemed a good idea,
to honor the 19th-century suffragist. Too bad Americans thought it
wasn't worth a plugged nickel.
</P>
<P>
   Money designers thought they had learned a lesson from the
preceding silver dollar, the Dwight D. Eisenhower. Ike flopped
because he looked like Casper the Ghost, and the coins were heavy
enough to ruin trouser pockets.
</P>
<P>
   The mint wised up and made the Susan B. smaller. Problem was, it
was no bigger than a quarter. The Susan B. was such a stinker that
the mint still has 100 million stocked in its vaults, 20 years
later. The one place you're likely to get one is in change at the
U.S. Post Office, where a $20 bill in a stamp machine is a big
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, the poor girl never had a chance. When other
countries introduced a dollar coin, they removed the competition,
the dollar bill. But Americans cling fast to their George
Washingtons. So Susan sank.
</P>
<P>
   The John F. Kennedy half dollar, minted in 1964, never caught
on, either. The coins are still being made, but when was the last
time you saw one? Or better yet, the last time you used one?
Vending machines eat them, parking meters won't take them, and coin
laundries spit them out.
</P>
<P>
   But time was, before World War II, that the feds made money we
cherished. They printed $1,000, $5,000 and $10,000 bills, and even
if we never held them, we sought them.
</P>
<P>
   There's no question we Americans love our cash, but tinker with
it and expect complaints. You can take that to the bank.

 UNDATED: Carrillo Fuentes.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Barely six weeks later, two senior agents were dispatched to
Mexico City to meet with Mexican officials.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of sharp criticism from opposition politicians who
are now weighing a huge bailout of the troubled banking system,
Mexican officials have acknowledged only one meeting _ one at which
the Customs agents briefed a former deputy attorney general who is
a member of the political opposition.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, U.S. officials said the agents laid out most of what
they knew to the former deputy attorney general, Rafael Estrada
Samano, and asked for his help. They said they then gave a separate
, less detailed presentation to a deputy minister of finance,
Ismael Gomez Gordillo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked him to conduct a joint investigation with us,'' said
one official with direct knowledge of the meeting with Estrada.
``That would have included them covering meetings with the
traffickers, conducting surveillance. Estrada said he had to check
with his boss and would get back to us. But they just wouldn't
respond to us. And after a couple of months, we gave up.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Tuesday, Mexican Attorney General Jorge Madrazo
said he believed the Americans had been vague about both the
investigation and their needs. He acknowledged that Gomez Gordillo
also met with the agents, but said they had asked him only for
information on some Mexican bank accounts, which he provided.
</P>
<P>
   While U.S. officials have defended the secrecy of the operation
as necessary to protect the lives of undercover agents, it has gone
largely unnoticed that senior Mexican law-enforcement officials
knew for more than two years that Customs agents were investigating
money laundering by Mexican banks, and that the operation was
apparently never jeopardized as a consequence. But from the Mexico
City briefings, Customs officials grew suspicious about the lack of
response they got.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was obvious that something was screwed up, whether it was
corruption or something else,'' one law-enforcement official said.
``And that did factor into our decision not to go back to them
later on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Doctor, '' who agents identified as Victor Manuel Alcala
Navarro, introduced Javier Ramirez and his purported launderers to
an ever-widening group of Mexican bankers.
</P>
<P>
   But he also introduced the agents to his boss, a man they
identified as Jose Alvarez Tostado and came to believe was the
principal money launderer for the Juarez cartel.
</P>
<P>
   In little more than a year, the agents managed to launder more
than $62 million in drug profits funneled from sales in the United
States and Canada. But they might have done far more. At one
Illinois safehouse of the gang, they found a ledger documenting the
collection of $200 million by part of the organization over a
period of about 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were so conservative about what we did and how much we
moved that we were constantly in danger of losing our credibility
with the bankers,'' said one Customs official. The bankers, he
said, far from being enticed to break laws, were uniformly
introduced to the agents by drug traffickers. ``We could have done
not millions of dollars, but hundreds of millions.''
</P>
<P>
   But senior Mexican investigators who have pursued the Juarez
gang sharply criticized the U.S. operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Customs guys didn't even get the name of their main target
right,'' one Mexican officials said dismissively. ``It's Juan Jose
Castellanos Alvarez-Tostado. And he's not such a big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mexicans noted that they have worked closely with agents
from both the Drug Enforcement Administration and the FBI, dealt
with a much wider part of the same drug organization, and could
easily have helped Customs agents had they been asked.
</P>
<P>
   The agents, however, received clear instructions from above.
</P>
<P>
   In briefings last November and December for Reno, Rubin and a
few of their subordinates, officials said there was considerable
discussion of possible ``collateral effects'' once the
investigation went public: diplomatic troubles; an impact on the
Mexican financial markets; even the possibility that the weak
Mexican banking industry, could have trouble getting interbank
loans.
</P>
<P>
   But several officials said it was Rubin _ whose Treasury
Department has often been depicted by other officials in Washington
as skeptical about Mexican corruption and skittish about tough U.S.
measures to fight it _ who insisted that the operation proceedin
secret.
</P>
<P>
   Those left out, they said, included not only the Mexican
government but senior officials at the White House, the State
Department and even the Treasury itself.
</P>
<P>
   While senior Mexican officials initially praised the operation
after its disclosure, they said they did so after being told that
none of the undercover work was done on Mexican soil. When they
read the indictments and saw that wasn't so they were incensed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very clear that there is an ignorance of Mexican law on
the part of the United States,'' said Madrazo, the attorney
general, ``or if not the United States, at least among the agents
who participated in this.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials acknowledged that the repercussions are more than
a matter of diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes of wrangling a form of diplomatic protection for U.S.
agents in Mexico, ``administrative and technical immunity,'' have
been discarded. Thoughts of following up the investigation are
fading. Although Customs officials have the name of a Mexican army
general and the rough identities of federal police agents who were
said by one of the suspects to have laundered illicit profits, the
U.S. agents are debating whether even to pass them on.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of the suspects who couldn't be lured to the United
States have been arrested in Mexico. But the one whom U.S.
officials believe knew the most, an investment banker named Enrique
Mendez Urena who was said to have worked for the trafficker
Carrillo Fuentes, did not fare well.
</P>
<P>
   After Mendez's name and Mexico City address were sent to Mexican
officials, he was arrested in Puerto Vallarta, and then suddenly
died of massive head injuries. The state police, who apparently
arrested him, said he was acting strangely and hurt himself in
jail.

BOB HOPE STORY BRINGS CELEBRITY DEATH-WATCHERS BACK TO LIFE

<P>
   When a pre-written obituary about entertainer Bob Hope became
public, it not only stirred up the masses, it aroused a rather
morbid bunch on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   It grabbed the attention of celebrity death-watchers.
</P>
<P>

REPORT THAT SLIM JIM ACTIVATES SIDE AIR BAG CAUSES SCARE AMONG
POLICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL WEISSENSTEIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ If you just locked your keys in your
late-model Cadillac DeVille and you're thinking of flagging down a
cop here; forget it.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth officers received a strongly worded federal alert
last month. It warned that a Slim Jim _ a thin strip of metal used
to pop a car lock from the outside _ can activate a side air bag,
launching the tool at the user's face with potentially fatal
results.
</P>
<P>
   There's just one problem. The report was a hoax.
</P>
<P>
   The Slim Jim/side air bag warning is a virulent strain of urban
legend that's duped thousands of police and fire departments
nationwide, experts said. The report has spread via e-mail and
Internet discussion groups, reaching officials from Salem, Ore., to
Albany, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all baloney,'' said Ed Sparkman, an Illinois car theft
expert who has researched the report.
</P>
<P>
   But police officers still take the warning seriously. In Fort
Worth, many aren't using Slim Jims on vehicles with side air bags
such as 1998 Chevrolet Venture minivans and Toyota Avalon sedans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't risk the danger to one of my officers,'' said Lou
Davis, supervisor of the department's downtown traffic unit. ``We
are not unlocking any cars with side bags.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the new world of the Internet hoax, where campfire
scare stories become fast-moving electronic chain-letters _
difficult to verify and easy to send on to friends and colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   The Slim Jim report even reached the Environmental Protection
Agency, whose Dallas office was the source of Fort Worth's warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even have a clue as to who sent me that,'' said Josie
Hopkins, EPA safety and health manager in Washington, D.C. ``I just
read it and thought, `I'll share this with the people out in the
field.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Like most reports, the alert from Dallas says that at least
three police officers in the United States have been killed by
inadvertently deploying an air bag with a Slim Jim.
</P>
<P>
   But manufacturers say activating an air bag that way is
virtually impossible. And officials at the Law Enforcement
Officers' Memorial Fund in Washington, which tracks law enforcement
officers' deaths in the line of duty, say there are no such fatal
accidents on record.
</P>
<P>
   The hoax apparently began when an unnamed officer from Ohio
dropped by a Montgomery County, Md., police station, said Jim
Onder, a highway safety specialist for the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohioan told a Maryland police sergeant taking a cigarette
break that a fellow officer had been injured when an exploding side
air bag blew his Slim Jim into his face, said Onder.
</P>
<P>
   The sergeant's supervisor sent out a countywide alert and
Maryland state police broadcast the alert nationwide, said Ron
Moore, a rescue expert who wrote an article on the hoax for
Firehouse Magazine, a firefighters' trade publication.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth Fire Department officials who read the article
disregarded the Slim Jim warning, said Lt. Kent Worley, a
department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Onder said: ``Everybody was relying on someone's e-mail or memo
or newsletter. They've been flippantly passing this info on without
checking the source.''
</P>
<P>
   That's typical of an Internet hoax, said David Emery, a
freelance writer who runs a World Wide Web site dedicated to urban
legends and folklore.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, someone misattributed a supposed two-word
graduation speech _ ``wear sunscreen'' _ to novelist Kurt Vonnegut.
The specious speech to Massachusetts Institute of Technology grads
was actually taken from a column by a Chicago Tribune columnist.
Thousands of people were fooled.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you do is click the forward button and it goes to
somebody,'' Emery said. ``I didn't tell you Kurt Vonnegut gave that
speech. I just forwarded a message telling you that he did.''

 By LESLIE EATON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The topic may have been an arcane change to the
securities laws, but there was the sound of old-fashioned melodrama
Wednesday in a hearing room on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the legislation talked of protecting the
hard-working companies that are trying to cure AIDS, heart disease
and other ailments. Opponents talked about protecting ``the weak,
the frail, the infirm and those not fully able to defend
themselves.'' There was even a mysterious villain in the piece,
cryptically referred to by several congressmen as the notorious
``Mr. L.''
</P>
<P>
   But the subtext of this discussion could not have been more
up-to-the minute: the growing political influence of the companies
in California's Silicon Valley, which have begun flexing their
political muscles after years of disdaining government and
politicians' increasing desire to tap into the glamour _ and gold _
of the booming high-technology industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology community has an advantage most industries
don't,'' said Dan Schnur, Republican political director of
Technology Network, or Technet, a year-old political advocacy group
that represents 140 California companies. ``The National Widgets
Association would have a much tougher time getting attention,
because Silicon Valley is about the future, and I don't know of any
politician who has come out against the future.''
</P>
<P>
   And the No. 1 issue on Silicon Valley's agenda right now is the
Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act, which is the bill that
was approved Wednesday by the finance subcommittee of the House
Commerce Committee. Identical legislation has already passed in the
Senate, so if the House approves the bill _ which it seems all but
certain to do _ Technet will have scored its first federal victory.
</P>
<P>
   The actual content of the bill is hardly likely to catch the
attention of most voters. Basically, it would prevent investors and
their lawyers from filing class-action securities fraud cases in
state courts. Instead, these suits would have to be brought in
federal court under strict rules imposed by Congress in 1995 to
discourage ``meritless'' lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules would apply only to securities traded on national
stock exchanges, which supporters of the bill contend should be
covered by national, rather than state, standards.
</P>
<P>
   The connection between such legislation and the high-technology
industry may not be immediately apparent _ except to those who know
that technology companies have been frequent targets of
class-action securities frauds suits.
</P>
<P>
   And California is also home to Mr. L. _ William S. Lerach _ who
is probably the most feared of the class-action lawyers for
plaintiffs. In 1996, he tried to persuade state voters to loosen
the rules in state courts to make it even easier for investors to
sue companies. The high-technology industry spent $40 million to
beat the initiative, in what was by many accounts its political
awakening.
</P>
<P>
   Now Silicon Valley wants to make sure it never faces a similar
threat, in California or anywhere else. And it is putting its money
on the line. In 1995 and 1996, the industry gave $4 million to
congressional candidates. And in the last 18 months, even before
the campaign fund-raising season has fully swung into action,
computer companies and their executives have already given more
than $1.2 million. That includes $150,000 to members of the Senate
Banking Committee, which handled the litigation legislation but
otherwise has little involvement in technology issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've really opened up their wallets,'' said Jennifer
Shecter, an analyst for the Center for Responsive Politics, a
nonpartisan research group. ``This industry has so much money, and
if as a politician you can tap that successfully, you're golden.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, the high-technology industry had a reputation for
being politically naive. Ms. Shecter said that is no longer the
case. She pointed out that Technet, for one, is serving as a
conduit for individual contributions, which allows the organization
to get credit for delivering funds while keeping contributions
within legal limits.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Technet funneled $37,500 to the campaign of Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., chairman of the Banking Committee,
according to a filing the organization made in March with the
Federal Election Commission. The list of contributors from Silicon
Valley includes venture capitalists, investment bankers, technology
executives and even a couple of political action committees.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato has also received more than $50,000 from other
high-technology executives and corporate PACs, according to the
Center for Responsive Politics. The group's study included
information released by the FEC as of May 1, and may understate the
amounts because not all donors' professions were identified.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Is there any connection between D'Amato's support of the uniform
standards legislation, which backers say was important to its
success, and the campaign contributions? ``The New York Times'
questions get more ridiculous every week,'' said Lisette McSoud
Mondello, D'Amato's director of communications. ``This bill was
introduced by two other senators, passed the Senate overwhelmingly
and with strong bipartisan support, was supported by the White
House and the Securities and Exchange Commission. And it's good
legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the sponsors of the bill in the Senate, Christopher Dodd,
D-Conn., was a sponsor of the 1995 securities litigation reform
bill as well. He has raised more than $24,000 the last two years
from computer companies, almost all of them from outside
Connecticut, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
</P>
<P>
   Dodd, said Ellen Miller, president of Public Campaign, which
advocates publicly financed elections, ``has carried enough water
for the securities, investment, accounting and high-tech computer
industries to fill all of the bathtubs of Connecticut.''
</P>
<P>
   That statement is ``garbage,'' replied Marvin Fast, Dodd's
spokesman. ``Chris Dodd fights for what he believes in. He works
for the people of Connecticut, and no one else.''
</P>
<P>
   Lobbying involves more than campaign contributions, of course,
and Silicon Valley has become more adept at getting its message
across. In late May, less than two weeks before his House
subcommittee was to take up the legislation, Rep. Michael Oxley,
R-Ohio, visited California under the auspices of Technet and met
with several companies.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Oxley did not respond to questions about his
trip.
</P>
<P>
   Schnur of Technet said such face-to-face visits, rather than
campaign contributions, help explain his group's success.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, politicians are falling all over themselves to be
associated with high-technology industries. said Mark Gitenstein,
counsel for the more traditional lobbying group on this issue, the
Uniform Standards Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in policy are attracted by the new economy,'' he said.
``The percentage of jobs they are creating dwarfs the smokestack
industries. That's what this is all about. There is no question
that the very mechanism by which they flourish is chilled by
litigators.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is what the 1995 securities law was supposed to
prevent: class-action lawyers jumping on a company because its
stock tumbled, finding a plaintiff who owned a handful of shares,
and rushing to the courthouse to sue for fraud. Companies settled
almost all of these lawsuits, arguing that the cost of fighting
them was prohibitive.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the 1995 legislation, however, said that it would
encourage securities fraud and deprive investors of one of the few
ways they had to recover money in a fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The fight over the 1995 legislation was extremely contentious,
pitting securities firms, accountants and, increasingly, the
technology industry, against trial lawyers and consumer groups.
Clinton vetoed the bill; Congress overrode his veto for the first
and only time.
</P>
<P>
   The 1995 law requires that, when they are filed, class-action
securities fraud suits contain very specific accusations, and it
does not permit plaintiffs to demand information from a company
until a judge has ruled on the company's motion to dismiss the
lawsuit. It also provided a ``safe harbor'' that allows companies
to make predictions about their business without being legally
liable if those predictions fail to come true.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for plaintiffs fought back with Proposition 211, which
was on the ballot in California in 1996. This initiative would have
made it far easier for investors and their lawyers to file
securities-fraud lawsuits against companies. At first, it appeared
to enjoy wide public support.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Proposition 211 was roundly defeated _ primarily
through a $40 million campaign organized by high-technology firms,
venture capitalists and investment bankers. That effort led to the
creation of Technet.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, securities lawyers began filing class-action
fraud suits in state courts, where the new federal rules did not
apply. The number of such cases jumped from about 19 in 1992 and 41
in 1994 to 70 in 1996, according to a study by two Stanford
University law professors, Michael Perino and Joseph Grundfest, who
also is a former commissioner of the SEC. More than half these were
filed in California.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1997, a funny thing happened: The number of state
lawsuits began to decline, falling to just 24 in the first six
months of the year. ``I still haven't done the final statistics for
1997, but the raw amount of litigation is less than in 1996,'' said
Perino, who has recently joined the faculty at St. John's
University in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Lerach, the California lawyer, said the number of such suits is
declining because state courts have not turned out to be ``an
effective forum.'' Not only are the courts overburdened, he said,
but it is unclear if one can bring a national class-action case in
California.
</P>
<P>
   So why does he think Silicon Valley's executives are so intent
on getting the litigation bill passed? ``I don't say it in a mean
way,'' Lerach responded, ``but they are intoxicated with their own
power, and think they can get what they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Valley's power clearly had an impact on Arthur Levitt
Jr., the politically astute chairman of the SEC, who reversed
himself and agreed to support the litigation bill on the day his
renomination was taken up by the Senate Banking Committee. The
commission's staff argues that he got some significant
modifications to the legislation in exchange for his support, and
that the commission wants to encourage companies to provide more
forward-looking information for investors, which they have been
reluctant to do because of their fears of state lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, said one former SEC lawyer, it was impossible for the
commission to resist. ``This is the most powerful lobbying force in
America today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups have tried to stop the legislation, which they
argue will deprive investors of their rights. But they are not
optimistic. ``It's been clear Congress was going to do this, and
it's hard to justify making a massive campaign in a future
effort,'' said Barbara Roper, director of investor protection for
the Consumer Federation of America.
</P>
<P>
   Just because the opponents are not mounting a big
counter-offensive, however, does not mean Silicon Valley's
executives are relaxing their push. ``One neat thing about our
community,'' said Schnur of Technet, ``is that it is filled with
people who don't take no for an answer.''

PROGRAM HELPS KIDS GET A FIRST SWING AT GOLF 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By JACK CAVANAUGH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARRISON, N.Y. _ Twelve-year-old Jason Diaz had taken three
ferocious swings and hit nothing but air on the practice range at
the Westchester Country Club here. But then the advice he had been
receiving from Ben Hoffhine, an assistant professional at the club,
finally registered, and Jason, swinging easier, laced a tee shot
right down the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Jason's swings and misses were understandable because this was
the first time the seventh grader had ever held a golf club in his
hands. The same was true for about 35 of his classmates from Virgil
Grissom Junior High School in South Ozone Park, Queens, who were
getting their first exposure to golf at a clinic conducted on
Tuesday in conjunction with this week's Buick Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Asked after a dozen or so swings if he had enjoyed his first
golf outing, Jason said, ``I like it as long as I can hit it.''
</P>
<P>
   That evoked a smile from Robert Klineman, the founder and
director of Inner-City Student Golf-USA, a nonprofit organization
whose goal is to provide instruction and playing time for
youngsters 10 to 15 years of age in New York and, eventually,
elsewhere in the country. The group from Virgil Grissom Junior
High, chaperoned by three teachers, is one of the first to be
involved in the program, which Klineman said he started two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   In all, about 500 schoolchildren from the New York metropolitan
area turned out at the clinic, sponsored by the Callaway Golf Co.
The youngsters received instruction from Rocco Mediate, a 13-year
professional who is entered in the Buick Classic; Rick Smith, who
coaches a number of players on the PGA Tour; Tom Patri, the
director of instruction at the Westchester Country Club, and
several of Patri's assistants.
</P>
<P>
   The one-day clinic, which has been held annually for 10 years,
is one of a growing number of such group instructional sessions
being held across the country to foster an interest in golf,
particularly among underprivileged youngsters. Many of the children
at the Callaway clinic are also involved in the Metropolitan PGA's
Golf in Schools program, in which Met PGA pros provide instruction
in golf fundamentals during physical education classes once or
twice a week for six weeks every spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The program has grown tremendously since we started it 10
years ago,'' said Ben Ward, the administrator for the Met PGA
program, which now involves about 5,000 children from elementary
through high school. ``We hold workshops for gym teachers so that
they can provide golf instruction when the pros aren't there.
Beyond that, we also bus kids to driving ranges, where our pros
work with them and, whenever possible, get them to play on courses
in the metropolitan area.''
</P>
<P>
   The Met PGA also provides golf clubs to youths who need them,
along with balls and other equipment. As much as possible, the Golf
in Schools program is extended into the summer months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have about 120 kids in our program, and in the spring we
take as many as we can to Pelham Split Rock in the Bronx twice a
week to play the course,'' said Michael Correa, a gym teacher at
Community Elementary School 4 in the South Bronx, who shepherded 28
of his pupils to the clinic. ``Then in the summer, I work with
about 15 of the kids who are able to get to the course.''
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Perez, a sixth grader at CES 4, conceded that he
approached golf with a considerable amount of skepticism. ``I
thought it was a boring game,'' the 12-year-old said. ``But now
it's my favorite sport.''
</P>
<P>
   As it is, apparently, for many of the youngsters, if not most,
involved in the Met PGA program, to whom Tiger Woods, and not
Michael Jordan, has emerged as the No. 1 sports idol.
</P>
<P>
   In-school golf instructional programs have also proved popular
elsewhere. In Bridgeport, Conn., about 60 middle school pupils have
been enrolled each academic year since 1993 in an after-school
program that blends academics with golf instruction. Assisted with
donations from the U.S. Golf Association, corporate sponsors, the
Tiger Woods Foundation and other nonprofit organizations and using
equipment donated by golf manufacturers, the children meet after
school for three hours twice a week.
</P>
<P>
   Half of that time is devoted to reading comprehension and
problem-solving skills in mathematics and the other half to golf
instruction. During spring and summer, the children spend most of
their time at the Fairchild Wheeler Golf Club in Fairfield, Conn.,
which is owned by the city of Bridgeport and where, under
supervision by golf instructors, they have free access to the
driving range and the course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite a few of these kids are at-risk students,'' Alan
Wallack, the director of athletics for the Bridgeport school
system, said, ``and many of them have gained self-confidence from
the program.''
</P>
<P>
   In New Haven, about 150 schoolchildren, most of them black and
Hispanic, take part annually in the Inner City First Swing Golf
Association program, which is held twice a week, year-round, for
those 8 to 18 years of age.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, the reaction of most kids was negative,'' said
Cheryl Merritt, a sixth-grade science teacher at the Jackie
Robinson Middle School in New Haven, who co-founded the program.
``The kids would say golf was boring and was for old people. Or
they'd say, `Blacks and Hispanics don't play golf.' But they don't
say that anymore.'' &QL;

DELTA HIRES MARKETING CHIEF
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (dc) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frederick W. Reid, the president of Lufthansa, will join Delta
Air Lines as marketing chief, the latest in a series of top
personnel changes by Leo F. Mullin, Delta's new chairman and chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Reid, who is 47 and from San Francisco, worked at Pan American
World Airways and American Airlines before joining Lufthansa in
1991 to head its operations in North and South America. He moved
quickly through the ranks, becoming chief operating officer in 1995
and president last year.
</P>
<P>
   At Delta, Reid will have wide-ranging responsibilities,
including in-flight service, sales, advertising, routes and
pricing. He will also play a crucial role in the recently announced
domestic alliance between Delta, the country's third-largest
airline, and United Airlines, the country's largest and a unit of
UAL Corp. That deal is still awaiting government approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will have the primary responsibility for satisfying the
customer and improving the revenues of the company,'' Mullin said
of Reid.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment is the second major hire made by Mullin, a
former banker, who joined Delta in August. Last fall, he forced
Thomas J. Roeck Jr., the airline's chief financial officer, to
resign, replacing him in March with Warren Jenson, 41, who was
chief financial officer at the NBC television network. In April, he
forced out Robert W. Coggin, the executive vice president in charge
of marketing, and Robert G. Adams, senior vice president of
personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Both Jenson and Reid will hold the title of executive vice
president, putting each of them in line one day to succeed Mullin,
who is 55. Reid was not available for comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The moves are an attempt to bring fresh blood into Delta, which
has long promoted from within and is widely seen as the most
lackluster of the major airlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been the general view _ and I think it is the case _
that Delta has been weak in the marketing area,'' Mullin
acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Mullin himself was heavily criticized earlier this year
for not understanding the nuances of the airline industry after
Delta missed an opportunity to merge with Continental Airlines.
Continental's largest investors instead sold a controlling stake in
the carrier to Northwest Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Mullin played down the significance of that episode and went on
to negotiate the alliance with United. He has also moved quickly to
expand into Latin America and overhaul the interiors of Delta's
airplane fleet and its airport VIP clubs. He hired a new head of
information technology and recently purchased a new computer system
to forecast demand and set prices, which he says will generate $300
million to $450 million in additional annual revenues three years
from now.
</P>
<P>
   Mullin said that he would hire a new manager of human resources
in three or four months.

CHINA BANS BOOK THAT DETAILS CLINTON SEX SCANDALS
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ In a seeming attempt to spare President Clinton
embarrassment on his state visit, officials ordered bookstores this
week to remove from their shelves a popular new book that details
the sex scandals surrounding the American leader.
</P>
<P>
   The book, ``Clinton: A President of Strong Drives,'' is a glossy
302-page quick-publish quick-read issued here weeks ago by the
Xueyuan Publishing House in the hopes of capitalizing on Clinton's
visit, which begins on June 25.
</P>
<P>
   Based largely on American news reports, the first five chapters
delve into Clinton's reported encounters with Gennifer Flowers, who
said she had an affair with Clinton; Paula Corbin Jones, a former
Arkansas employee who filed a sexual-harassment suit against him,
and Monica Lewinsky, a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   The last five chapters explore less titillating episodes of the
president's life like the death of his father before he was born
and the standoff with Iraq last winter.
</P>
<P>
   And just so Chinese readers receive the full flavor of recent
cases, the book includes 30 pages of color photographs like happy
pictures of the Clintons holding hands, photomontages of women who
have been linked to Clinton and a shot of Clinton's famous hug with
Ms. Lewinsky on the White House lawn.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-thousand copies of the book were printed and, when the
State Press and Publications Department ordered it off the shelves,
it had had almost sold out.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary Chinese have both admiration for Clinton and, as China
has opened up, a tittering interest in things sexual, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Also, after decades with little to read, Chinese are fond of
quick biographies and lively narratives. An account of the mass
suicide by members of the Heaven's Gate cult in California was
popular this year.
</P>
<P>
   Although Chinese censorship has loosened considerably, it was
perhaps predictable that Chinese officials would find the latest
look at the Clinton sex reports too distasteful. The private lives
of Chinese leaders are carefully guarded, so that citizens
generally have little idea how many children they have, let alone
the particulars of any affairs.
</P>
<P>
   In fact the book presents a far more sympathetic look at
Clinton's private life than he has enjoyed in similar places in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Calling Clinton ``young, promising and elegant,'' the book says,
``He has achieved a lot.'' It accuses the American news media of
``fabricating news'' and the Republican Party of ``criticizing the
weak points and personal blemishes of its rivals just for the sake
of returning to power.''
</P>
<P>
   A portrait of Clinton with outstretched hands carries the
admiring caption, ``No wonder so many women have claimed to have
had affairs with him.''

UNFORTUNATELY, SENTENCE GIVEN TO NICHOLS IS LONG, NOT LETHAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Richard Matsch gave Terry Nichols the
toughest sentence available under the law. The sentence: Lock him
up and throw away the key.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad the judge couldn't give Nichols the sentence he
deserved: a trip to Death Row.
</P>
<P>
   A jury in Denver could have sentenced Nichols to death after
convicting him of helping Timothy McVeigh plan the Oklahoma City
bombing. Federal law gives jurors the option of imposing capital
punishment for the crime of ``conspiracy to use a weapon of mass
destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   But the jury couldn't reach a unanimous verdict on the question
of capital punishment vs. life in prison. They decided not to
decide, and that left sentencing up to the judge; the stiffest
penalty the law allowed him to hand out was life without parole.
</P>
<P>
   Those jurors who copped out when faced with the task of
sentencing Nichols were the same jurors, of course, who couldn't
bring themselves to convict him of murder. They opted instead for a
finding of involuntary manslaughter in the deaths of eight federal
agents who were among the 168 people killed in the April 19, 1995,
bombing of Oklahoma City's Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building.
</P>
<P>
   It is considered bad form in some circles to criticize jury
verdicts, seeing as how juries are composed of just plain citizens
who sacrifice much time and effort in return for virtually no
remuneration and mostly no gratitude from the community they serve
so selflessly. But the Nichols verdict was a major-league
head-scratcher, if not a bafflement of historic proportions.
</P>
<P>
   How in the world could jurors find that Nichols conspired to use
a weapon of mass destruction _ conspiring with McVeigh, of all
people, who was sentenced to death in an earlier trial _ and then
find him not guilty of murdering people who died in the mass
destruction?
</P>
<P>
   Even in the face of that mind-boggling lapse of logic, however,
the jury could have used the conspiracy conviction to put Nichols
in the death chamber right along with McVeigh. But they didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Which set the stage for Thursday's sentencing by the judge, who
seems very much like a man who might have doled out the ultimate
punishment to Nichols if only the law had allowed it.
</P>
<P>
   Matsch called Nichols an ``enemy of the Constitution'' as he
slapped him with a life sentence on the conspiracy charge and eight
concurrent terms of six years each in the deaths of the federal
agents. To the extent that he was able to do so, Matsch threw the
book at Nichols; it's easy to imagine that the judge would have
enjoyed throwing a bigger book.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols accepted his fate with no outward sign of emotion,
although one news report said that he ``sank into a chair and began
to quietly sob'' before the judge entered the courtroom to begin
the hearing. Do you suppose he quietly sobbed for the 168 victims
who lost their lives as the result of his conspiracy? Did he sob
for the loved ones of those who were killed, or for the 500 people
who were injured in the bombing?
</P>
<P>
   Probably not, if a letter that Nichols wrote to the judge after
his trial was an accurate indication of his remorsefulness.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I did anything to contribute to the cause of the Oklahoma
City bombing, I am sorry, I'm truly sorry,'' Nichols wrote.
``Perhaps I should have questioned McVeigh more about certain
things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If'' he did anything to contribute to the bombing?
</P>
<P>
   You really have to admire a guy who takes responsibility for his
actions.
</P>
<P>
   The letter apparently represented Nichols' best bid for a
lighter sentence, and the judge properly treated the letter with
all the respect it warranted: none.
</P>
<P>
   But Matsch reportedly offered to cut Nichols some slack if he
would provide additional information about the planning and
execution of the bombing. Nichols declined that deal, his lawyers
said, because he faces further prosecution in Oklahoma and feared
that any information he provided might be used against him.
</P>
<P>
   The Oklahoma prosecutors, by the way, will seek the death
penalty for both Nichols and McVeigh when they put them on trial
for the 160 bombing deaths that were not included in the federal
trials. Maybe those Oklahoma jurors will give Nichols the sentence
he deserves.

IMF DEMANDS IMPROVEMENTS IN RUSSIAN ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The International Monetary Fund has told the Russian
government that it needs to slash its budget deficit and overhaul
its antiquated tax system if it wants to qualify for billions of
dollars in additional loans, senior Russian officials said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Among other measures, the fund also wants Russia to strengthen
its banking system. And fund officials have even gone so far as to
suggest that the operations of Gazprom, the huge natural gas
monopoly, be split up.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF says its demands are intended to advance long-stalled
economic reforms. But the fund's critics worry that the IMF may be
asking too much of Russia at a time when its financial markets are
under enormous strain and new aides to President Boris Yeltsin are
just taking over.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF has refused to outline its demands in public. Its
official position is that it is too soon to say whether extra help
is even needed.
</P>
<P>
   But the fund opened negotiations with Moscow this week by
sending the Yeltsin government a confidential letter listing steps
it would like Russia to take, Russian officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not saying there will be no money for the Russian
government,'' an IMF official said. ``But we are not saying that it
is guaranteed, and we need to know if Russia can meet the
conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials said the measures suggested by the fund
include a commitment to slash Russia's budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Under the fund's plan, the deficit would be cut to 2.5 percent
of the nation's gross domestic product in 1999, well under the 4.5
percent target originally envisoned by the Russian government.
</P>
<P>
   The fund also wants Russia to adopt a new tax code that would
lower rates and make the taxation system more fair. Tax reform has
languished in the Communist-dominated Parliament, and the IMF would
like to see that measure and a new code on budgetary procedures
adopted before the Legislature recesses in mid-July, according to
Kremlin aides.
</P>
<P>
   Other fund proposals call on the central bank to be more open
about its activities and statistics and for Gazprom's pipeline to
be split from its gas extraction operations.
</P>
<P>
   The behind-the-scenes talks are taking place at a critical time
for the troubled Russian economy. Russia has been successful in
proping up the ruble. But its financial markets have been shaky.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Russia's stock market fell for a fifth straight
day and the government failed to sell enough treasury bills to
cover its short-term debt. On Tuesday Standard &AMP; Poor's lowered its
long-term credit rating for Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Western finance ministers and Western investors are
at odds over how much help Russia should receive and how fast.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF has already given Russia more than $5.2 billion of a $10
billion loan. It is soon expected to approve another $670 million
installment of this three-year loan.
</P>
<P>
   The key issue is whether to lend $5 billion to $10 billion in
additional funds, or perhaps even more, to help Russia's central
bank defend the ruble and ease the fears of foreign investors who
fear Russia's currency will be devalued.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris the Group of Seven nations said they would support an
additional IMF loan if needed. Many investment bankers, however,
say the West is moving much too slowly.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Based on what is going on in the market it is clear that
Russia needs more assistance,'' said Charles Blitzer, director of
emerging markets for Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, an investment
bank. ``And the sooner the size, timing and composition of that
support is known the better. Waiting to see if words alone
stabilize the market is a form of Russian roulette.''
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly the discussions are also focusing on what Russia
would have to do to get any extra assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Oleg Vyugin, Russia's deputy finance minister, has flown to
Washington for talks with IMF and American officials. The issue is
also the focus of top-level deliberations in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IMF has sent a written communication to the Russians, and
there are active consultations between the Russians and the IMF,''
a senior Western official said Wednesday. A Russian official said
that the letter was drafted by the fund's top expert on Russia,
John Odling-Smee.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the fund's guiding philosophy is that Russia is going to
have to do a lot more to restructure its economy and restore the
confidence of foreign investors if it wants to tap additional
funds.
</P>
<P>
   Some Russian officials say that IMF pressure is useful in
overcoming bureaucratic resistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never said the IMF is too tough,'' Boris Fyodorov, the
new head of the State Tax Service, said in an interview. ``My
personal view is that the IMF is never pressuring Russia enough.''
</P>
<P>
   But other pro-reform Russian aides say the matter is more
complex. They say the fund's pressure is useful to a point, but
they worry that Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko and his young team
of aides will not be able to meet all of the new conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fund's demands are sensible but also very difficult,''
said one Russian official. ``It is necessary to do them. The
question is whether it will be possible to do them.''
</P>
<P>
   A new tax code, for example, would require winning over the
Communist-dominated Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The new deficit target is considered to be very ambitious, and
the suggestion that Gazprom be broken up was called a political
non-starter by one Russian aide, who added that he doubted the fund
would insist on it.
</P>
<P>
   While Russia's economy is weak, it has other ways to raise
money, including through the Eurobond market and commercial bank
loans. And while the IMF position is strong, the fund has already
been encouraged by the Clinton administration to do more for the
Russians.
</P>
<P>
   American officials have supported the fund's basic line that
more Russian reforms are needed. But if the ruble began to falter,
American pressure for speedy IMF action would grow.
</P>
<P>
   As the U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers put it in
Paris Wednesday, the industrialized nations support aid ``as
necessary and as appropriate.

HONEYWELL TO HIRE LAID-OFF MOTOROLA, IN TEL WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CRAIG ANDERSON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (PHOENIX) - Relocating, re-training, starting over at the bottom
of the pay scale: These are the travails of the laid-off worker.
</P>
<P>
   That's if you can find a new job.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Valley Motorola Inc. employees and hundreds of
Intel Corp. workers are expected to lose their jobs in the next
year, but a massive hiring effort by Honeywell Inc. could ease the
pain for as many as 500 of them.
</P>
<P>
   Honeywell, which already employs 7,500 in the Phoenix area in
three main divisions, is suffering from a shortage of engineers,
technicians, assemblers and other personnel, staffing manager
Lesley Connelly said.
</P>
<P>
   The electronics and aviation systems manufacturer hopes to take
advantage of proposed layoffs at other high-tech firms to fill its
own personnel void.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the company is helping unemployed workers by
finding them new local jobs which require a minimal amount of
re-training, Connelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Due in part to a decreased demand for semiconductor chips, Intel
recently has announced it will cut 600 jobs in the Valley of the
Sun.
</P>
<P>
   While details about Motorola's cutbacks locally haven't been
finalized, the computer giant announced last week that it would
eliminate 10 percent of its workforce worldwide. If applied across
the board, the cut would amount to 2,000 of Motorola's 20,000
workers in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Connelly said Honeywell has 400 to 500 local jobs available and
about 80 more at a plant in Albuquerque, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   The company, the ninth-largest private employer in Arizona,
makes a variety of computer systems for everything from commercial
aircraft to space vehicles. Another division makes industrial
automation systems for companies that manufacturer a wide range of
products, including aspirin and paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to hire employees who have worked for big companies
like Intel and Motorola,'' Connelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola spokesman Larry Barton said the company appreciates
Honeywell's response to the layoffs, athough he is not sure whether
the help is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are hoping to have a good response to our voluntary
severance program, so job fairs and database searches will not be
needed,'' Barton said.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's response was more enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd be thrilled to work with them,'' said Intel spokeswoman
Shelly Esque. ``Our recruiters did a scan of the market and felt
that there were many, many good opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Esque said she wasn't aware of Honeywell's job openings but
expects the company's recruiters to post the jobs in Intel's career
resource center as soon as details are available. The center
already has 500 postings, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Although Honeywell does not manufacture the same type of product
as Intel and Motorola, which primarily make computer chips for
personal computers, cellular phones and other devices, Connelly
said the same kind of experience is required.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the skills are transferrable,'' she said. ``Where
re-training is required, we are happy to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Honeywell plans to attend upcoming job fairs for Intel and
Motorola employees, in addition to placing job announcements in
local newspapers. &QL;

<P>
   TOKYO _ Six months after it retreated from closing weak banks or
allowing them to fail, the Japanese government is once again
inclined to administer such shock therapy as a cure for the
nation's sick financial system.
</P>
<P>
   Although no bank failures are expected before elections for the
upper house of Parliament in July, comments from leaders of the
governing Liberal Democratic Party suggest that they would not
rescue financial institutions, some large, that are verging on
insolvency.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are betting against the survival of at least two of
Japan's weakest banks among the top 20 in the country, the Nippon
Credit Bank and the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Lenders and stockholders are abandoning them and other weak
institutions. Nippon Credit shares traded here Wednesday at 121
yen, down 4 percent so far this week. The Long-Term Credit Bank's
stock closed at 176 yen, down 8 percent in the same brief time.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have resumed handicapping merger possibilities they
envisioned last fall, when a string of failures shook the financial
system. Those merger possibilities were dropped when government
bureaucrats insisted that no further fallout was evident.
</P>
<P>
   ``There seems to be a greater possibility than before that the
government would consider shutting down some banks,'' said James P.
Fiorillo, a banking analyst at ING Baring Securities of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, Seiroku Kajiyama, a senior Liberal Democratic Party
leader whose outspoken criticism of government efforts to fix the
financial system have been a source of irritation, said Japan
needed only half the number of banks it now has. ``Japanese banks
can't survive with the current number,'' he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   And Koichi Kato, the party's general secretary and a longtime
critic of the Finance Ministry, which oversees the banking system,
said last month in Washington that more bank closings ``could well
be expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan's banks are struggling with an estimated $600 billion in
bad debt, a legacy of the speculative ``bubble economy'' of the
1980s. Last month, some of the largest banks reported their biggest
annual losses ever.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, the banking system seemed poised for a major overhaul
when a number of overly indebted institutions collapsed. Sanyo
Securities closed in November, quickly followed by the Hokkaido
Takushoku Bank, Yamaichi Securities and a smaller regional bank.
</P>
<P>
   Investors expected more, but the torrid pace seemed to unsettle
Finance Ministry bureaucrats, who spent much of December insisting
that no more banks would fail.
</P>
<P>
   But market wisdom has held just as stubbornly that, just as
there is overcapacity in the global auto business that only
consolidation will repair, there are too many Japanese financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment has hung over the Japanese economy and stock
market, despite a rescue package of 30 trillion yen for the
financial system as well as several economic-stimulus packages.
</P>
<P>
   With few options left, politicians now seem more resigned to
further financial institution failures.
</P>
<P>
   Fiorillo and other analysts decline to identify which banks they
considered candidates for closing.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Last fall, the government made life difficult for the firms that
employ analysts who spoke their minds about specific banks,
accusing them of spreading rumors to support short-sellers, or
investors who bet on stock declines. Right-wing extremists
threatened the lives of two banking analysts who made the names
public.
</P>
<P>
   Nippon Credit's problems have been grist for the rumor mill for
more than a year. The government arranged for a bailout for the
bank last summer, pressing insurance companies and other banks to
recapitalize it by buying preferred shares and issuing subordinated
debt, which carries a higher risk of nonpayment than other types of
debt.
</P>
<P>
   Nippon Credit now wants to extend the terms on some of those
loans because it will have trouble meeting its obligations. Lenders
are balking.
</P>
<P>
   One of those, Nippon Life Insurance Co., sent a clear signal of
its sentiments about the banking system when it announced over the
weekend that it would no longer make subordinated loans to
financial institutions because it considered them too great a
credit risk. The finance ministry has said it will not protect
shareholders or subordinated-debt holders.
</P>
<P>
   The Long-Term Credit Bank's shares have been pummeled, as rumors
circulated that its investment banking alliance with Swiss Bank
Corp. was unraveling. Both it and Swiss Bank deny that their
relationship is dissolving, but Swiss Bank has also made clear that
it feels no obligation to rescue its partner, should it need help.
</P>
<P>
   Fiorillo calls Long-Term Credit the ``hardest call'' he has. He
said the bank was not in as precarious a position as Nippon Credit
because it had no immediate need for additional funds.
</P>
<P>
   Moody's Investors Service currently gives 10 Japanese financial
institutions its worst rating for financial strength, including
Long-Term Credit, Sakura Bank and Daiwa Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Daiwa is widely regarded as a potential acquisition target for a
foreign bank. Tokai Bank and Asahi Bank are often discussed as
candidates for potential mergers or takeovers.
</P>
<P>
   And banks are expected to take advantage of changes in the
holding-company law to consolidate. Sanwa Bank, for instance, could
absorb Toyo Trust and Banking, or Fuji Bank could take in the
ever-ailing Yasuda Trust.

MARRIAGE-TAX AMENDMENT MOVES ANTI-SMOKING BILL ALONG IN SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo., Texas, S.C., Fla., Vt., Mass., Maine, R.I.)  (See also TOBACCO-LOTT) 
(th) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate voted Wednesday night to use part of the
money that would be raised from higher cigarette prices to give an
income-tax break to married couples with low and moderate incomes.
</P>
<P>
   The vote gave additional strength to anti-smoking legislation
that has been before the Senate for three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The marriage-tax amendment was approved on a voice vote, after a
procedural motion to kill it failed on a 50-48 roll call along
party lines.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican amendment to the tobacco bill would give all
couples with annual incomes below $50,000 a new tax deduction of
$825 this year, rising gradually to $3,300 in 2008. The amendment
was billed as a reduction in the marriage tax penalty _ the
additional income taxes some couples owe above what they would owe
if they were single.
</P>
<P>
   A Democratic alternative was then rejected, 55-43, on another
party-line vote.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican amendment would also allow self-employed
taxpayers to deduct the full cost of their medical insurance
premiums beginning with this year's taxes. Under the current tax
law, the self-employed can deduct 45 percent of the cost of
premiums, and the percentage will not reach 100 percent until 2007.
</P>
<P>
   The tax relief seemed likely to win more Republican support for
the underlying tobacco legislation. Many Republicans have argued
that the anti-smoking bill was mainly a tax increase to finance a
big-government solution to the problem of teen-age smoking that was
bound to fail.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the steam is taken out of the tax argument if, as
Wednesday night's amendment would require, one-third of all the
revenues generated would be used to provide a tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans argue that it is bad public policy to impose higher
taxes on couples who marry than on those who live together out of
wedlock. Party leaders have made elimination of the marriage
penalty their No. 1 tax priority this year.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the House of Representatives approved a budget
blueprint that would allot $100 billion to that end over the next
five years.
</P>
<P>
   The vote Wednesday night, which followed hours of tense
negotiations, was a big step in moving the tobacco bill to final
passage by the Senate. That could occur as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   But serious obstacles remain, especially a dispute over whether
the government's price-support program for tobacco farmers should
be abolished and how much money should be allotted to ease the
financial burden on tobacco growers and communities whose economy
depends on tobacco farming and cigarette manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   And many Republican senators continue to oppose the bill, even
with the tax breaks approved Wednesday night. ``The bill is still a
tax increase bill,'' said Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Meant to reduce the number of young people who start to smoke,
the bill would raise the price of cigarettes by at least $1.10 a
pack over the next five years, expand the government's authority to
regulate cigarette advertising and marketing and impose penalties
on tobacco companies if teen-age smoking did not fall to specified
levels.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Newt Gingrich said Wednesday that the House of
Representatives was working on a much narrower anti-smoking bill.
He called the measure before the Senate a ``dead end.''
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the tax break for couples, said Sen. Phil Gramm,
R-Texas, the main sponsor of the amendment, was to ``help working
families shield more of their income.''
</P>
<P>
   The new break would not be limited to those who face a marriage
penalty. More than half of taxpayers who file joint returns pay
lower taxes than they would if they filed as individuals _ what
some call a marriage bonus _ but even those with a bonus would be
entitled to the new deduction under the amendment approved
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   As a general rule, the penalty applies when a husband and wife
both work and earn approximately the same amount of money. Couples
normally get a bonus if only one spouse works or if one earns much
more than the other.
</P>
<P>
   All the Senate Democrats who voted favored killing the Gramm
amendment, except for Ernest Hollings of South Carolina. But they
were joined by only five Republicans: Susan Collins and Olympia
Snowe of Maine, John Chaffee of Rhode Island, Connie Mack of
Florida and James Jeffords of Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' alternative amendment, which failed, would have
given larger tax breaks than Gramm's plan to couples that faced a
marriage penalty but little if any tax relief to couples who now
pay lower taxes because they are married. ``There's no rationale
for rewarding those who get a bonus,'' said Sen. John Kerry,
D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also argued that the Gramm amendment would become so
expensive in the second decade of the next century that it would
eat into budget surpluses that should be set aside for Social
Security benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm said that the Democratic plan would have had the effect of
penalizing parents who stayed home to take care of children.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said that President Clinton preferred the
Democratic approach but could live with the Gramm amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco bill was approved by the Senate Commerce Committee
in April on a strong bipartisan vote. But the cigarette makers
abandoned the bill as too costly and mounted a nationwide
advertising and lobbying campaign to defeat the bill.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, the bill was bogged down in the Senate. But Tuesday,
senators began to find ways to unclog the logjam. The Senate then
attached to the tobacco bill several measures meant to combat drug
abuse, an important Republican issue. &QL;

   520&AMP;ADD  SENATE VOTES REDUCTION OF MARRIAGE
TAX PENALTY
 &HT;     With TOBACCO-TAX-CUT.
 &HT;     By LARRY LIPMAN 
 &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Republican-led Senate took the first step
toward its long-cherished goal of eliminating the ``marriage
penalty'' Wednesday by offering a tax cut to families earning less
than $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   The key 50-48 vote came on an amendment to the comprehensive
tobacco bill, which would raise the price of cigarettes by $1.10 a
pack.
</P>
<P>
   When fully implemented by 2008, the $46 billion measure,
sponsored by Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, would eventually provide a
$3,300 income tax deduction for married couples _ $1,650 for
married individuals filing separately _ who fell below the income
cap. For 1999, the first year it would take effect, the deduction
would be $850.
</P>
<P>
   Five Republicans joined the unanimous Democrats in opposing the
amendment. A $31 billion Democratic alternative, which its sponsors
said would have given more relief to those couples who pay higher
taxes because they are married but which would have taken less
money from anti-smoking and medical research efforts, failed 55-43.
</P>
<P>
   While Gramm's amendment would produce $46 billion in tax relief
over 10 years, over 25 years it would consume about one-third of
the $516 billion expected to be raised from the tobacco bill.
</P>
<P>
   The marriage penalty amendment, plus a drug enforcement
amendment adopted Tuesday, are two elements GOP lawmakers have
demanded be a part of any tobacco bill, and their adoption raised
hopes among the overall bill's backers that it would win Senate
passage.
</P>
<P>
   But even the amendments' sponsors indicated they still opposed
the tobacco bill sponsored by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., claiming
it was too expensive and too great an increase in federal programs.
With contentious amendments relating to relief for tobacco farmers
and limitations on attorneys fees still pending, the fate of the
tobacco bill remained uncertain late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, the Senate rejected, for the second time in
two days, a Democratic motion to curtail amendments and force a
final vote within a limited time. The vote was 55-43, largely along
party lines. Another vote to limit debate is scheduled for
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Although the White House would have preferred the Democratic
alternative, press secretary Mike McCurry said the Republican
proposal was acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have gone from an appetite for a much more expansive
approach on tax cuts ... to what is, in effect, a fairly targeted
approach to middle-income tax relief,'' McCurry said, adding that
the GOP plan was ``consistent with what the administration's
approach to tax relief has been.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, House Speaker Newt Gingrich signalled that the House
would not accept anything close to McCain's bill.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich said the House would pass a bill more narrowly focused
on reducing teen smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine why the Republican conference would pass a
$600 billion increase in the size of government. It is antithetical
to everything we believe in,'' Gingrich said. ``This became the
gravy train of Teddy Kennedy and every liberal in the country. The
House, I think, will never conference on the McCain bill. The
McCain bill, I believe, is a dead end because it got off the real
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The fight over the marriage tax had stymied progress on the
tobacco bill for the last two weeks, first as Gramm and McCain
negotiated the level of tax relief, then as the parties debated the
procedure they would use in considering their alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that smoking was far more prevalent among middle- and
low-income individuals, Gramm argued the marriage tax relief was
necessary because nearly half of the money raised by the bill would
come from families with incomes below $22,000 and nearly 60 percent
would be from families below $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shields tobacco companies and it squarely hits
moderate-income, blue-collar workers right in the wallet and in the
pocketbook,'' Gramm said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats argued that Gramm's proposal would not only help
couples paying the marriage penalty, but also those couples who
receive a tax benefit from being married.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, couples in which both partners earn about the same
amount of money pay higher taxes when married than they would have
if they remained single. But couples in which one partner makes
substantially more than the other _ such as in cases where one
spouse was at home _ generally pay lower taxes than if they were
not married.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic alternative, which would have given couples a 20
percent deduction on the income of the spouse earning the least,
was targeted at couples that paid a tax penalty, said Sen. John
Kerry, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   But Gramm argued that it discriminated unfairly against couples
in which _ in most cases _ the wife decided to stay at home and
raise the children.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic bill, Gramm said, ``gives no relief to the family
where one parent stays home and works in the home _ one of the most
important jobs in America and one of the most difficult jobs in
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want the government to be making the decision as to
whether parents work outside the home or inside the home,'' he
said. ``The tax code shouldn't discriminate against parents ... who
chose to have one of the parents stay home to raise children.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry warned that Gramm's proposal, because it was limited to
one-third of the tobacco bill's revenues, would require additional
money from the general fund. That would have to come out of the
government surplus earmarked for Social Security, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A vote for the Gramm amendment is a vote to take $90 billion
to $125 billion of surplus away from Social Security,'' Kerry said.

A REPUBLICAN TRIUMPH IS POSSIBLE, BUT ONLY IF ...
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texas Republicans are excited. And they have a right to be.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party of Texas is about to take over the state _
lock, stock and barrel.
</P>
<P>
   That's what the advance PR says, anyway, as Republicans from all
over Texas gather in Fort Worth this week for their state
convention. A media ``advisory'' hyping the convention proclaims
that ``Republicans are poised to sweep all statewide seats,
maintain our majority in the Senate, and take control of the Texas
House of Representatives for the first time in over 120 years.''
</P>
<P>
   There's more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trend toward Texas becoming a conservative Republican
state is undeniable and gaining momentum. The State Convention will
serve as the launching point for the Republican Party of Texas to
change the course of Texas history in 1998.''
</P>
<P>
   A skeptic might suspect that winning elections ``and'' changing
the course of history is an awfully ambitious agenda for
Republicans in a state where Democrats once reigned supreme _ and
not so long ago, come to think of it. An objective observer, if
there is such a thing nowadays, might wonder if the Republicans are
overreaching. There is that old saying about counting your
chickens, after all.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, there's another old saying: If you can do it,
it ain't bragging.
</P>
<P>
   Who would have guessed that the Republican Party of Texas could
have grown the way it has in recent years, that untold numbers of
card-carrying Texas Democrats could have been lured into the Grand
Old Party?
</P>
<P>
   Who would have guessed? Probably some of the same people who are
now predicting a Republican takeover of the Lone Star State.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of the GOP in Texas is no accident. It is the result
of years of hard work and dedication by party leaders and
grassroots volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   If Republicans keep working _ and keep working together _ there
is no reason they can't accomplish everything that the news
releases predict they will.
</P>
<P>
   The operative words here are ``working together.''
</P>
<P>
   The high-profile portion of the state convention _ the official
ceremonies and business sessions to be conducted Friday and
Saturday at the Fort Worth Convention Center _ is guaranteed to be
a gala exercise in party unity and back-slapping.
</P>
<P>
   All the big names will be on hand: Gov. George W. Bush, Sens.
Phil Gramm and Kay Bailey Hutchison, statewide candidates,
legislative leaders, congressional movers and shakers ...
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of rank-and-file Republicans will be there to cheer on
the party honchos, and to be cheered by the honchos in return. At
week's end, the Republicans figure to pour out of Forth Worth
energized and motivated as they look toward the history-changing
weeks and months ahead.
</P>
<P>
   That's how it will be, if the PR hype is accurate.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a potential problem. One faction of the Republican
Party wants to turn the GOP into something other than a statewide,
nationwide, majority party. What this faction wants, far more than
winning elections and prevailing in the halls of government, is to
purge the Republican Party of those it deems unworthy.
</P>
<P>
   Unworthy Republicans, by the way, are those who embrace any idea
or attitude that fails to conform with the controlling faction's
agenda. And that agenda is mostly set behind the scenes, beyond the
public's view.
</P>
<P>
   While the party celebrates its unity and ubiquitousness, while
the throngs applaud the speeches by Bush and Gramm and others, the
behind-the-scenes manipulators will be working to undermine the
widespread appeal of Republicanism. They will be working to narrow
the party's scope in a way that discourages any divergence of views
and precludes the possibility of universal participation.
</P>
<P>
   That's no way to run a party.
</P>
<P>
   If the Republican Party truly wants to dominate politics in
Texas and across America, then it should use the occasion of its
state convention in Fort Worth to reiterate its commitment to that
``big tent'' we used to hear so much about.
</P>
<P>
   If the party of Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan truly wants to
change the course of history, it must remember that debate and
disagreement are crucial to a political party's enduring viability.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans must remember that a political party expands its
horizons by working toward principled consensus, not by imposing
rigid doctrines that exclude all dissent.

GREENSPAN SIGNALS NO DESIRE TO RAISE INTEREST RATES 

</HEADLINE>

By DAVID IVANOVICH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, applauding
the economy's ``virtuous cycle'' of strong growth and low
inflation, signaled no desire Wednesday to raise interest rates
anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan, appearing before Congress' Joint Economic Committee,
described the economy's ability to grow at such a strong clip while
keeping inflation in check as ``extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The current economic performance, with its combination of
strong growth and low inflation, is as impressive as any I have
witnessed in my near half-century of daily observation of the
American economy,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous analysts interpreted Greenspan's ever-careful
phraseology to mean the Fed has no intention of tightening monetary
policy by raising short-term interest rates at its meeting at the
end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are not the words of a man who is about to pull the
tightening trigger,'' said Robert Dederick, economic consultant for
Northern Trust in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Some Fed watchers are even ruling out a rate hike at the Fed
policy-making committee's subsequent session in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of positive-type references in his testimony suggest
that we're going to get a bye on, maybe, a meeting or a couple of
meetings,'' said James Barkocy, U.S. economist for Brown Brothers
Harriman in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street reacted positively to Greenspan's comments
Wednesday, rising slightly after his testimony. But even the
central banker's reassuring words could not head off a
late-afternoon sell-off that sent the Dow Jones industrial average
down 78.22 to close at 8971.70.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 1 1/4 points, or $12.50
per $1,000 bond, to 106, the biggest gain in almost six weeks. Its
yield fell 9 basis points to 5.70 percent, just above the 5.69
percent level reached Jan. 12, the lowest since the government
began regular sales of the 30-year securities in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   While maintaining an upbeat tone, Greenspan noted the economy is
feeling the effects of the economic and currency crisis in East
Asia, as well as a continued strong U.S. dollar abroad.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. exports fell during the first quarter for the first time in
four years, Greenspan noted.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of nation's domestic product was shaved by 2.5
percentage points to 4.8 percent, with the economic crisis in East
Asia, which has ravaged economies from Thailand to South Korea,
accounting for half of that reduction.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. inventories, meanwhile, are on the rise, an indication
production at many companies could slow even further later in the
year as companies work off excess stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the nation's economy has slowed from its ``torrid''
pace during the first quarter, Greenspan said, although it
continues to move ahead at a robust rate.
</P>
<P>
   All of these factors would tend to lessen concerns about a
return of inflation. In fact, inflation actually moved down further
during the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But Greenspan made clear the Fed has not dropped its guard
against this old enemy, run-away inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are remaining watchful for signs of potential inflationary
imbalances, even as the economy continues to perform more
impressively than it has in a very long time,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Chan, managing director and chief economist for Banc One
Investment Advisors Corp. in Columbus, Ohio, was struck by the
emphasis Greenspan gave to the Asian crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have not really seen a Federal Reserve in the past
stressing the effects of international forces,'' Chan said. ``So
given that these international forces have really become more
supportive of an unchanged policy, the message should be that the
Fed is not likely to raise rates.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During his testimony, Greenspan avoided the kind of explosive
choice of words that has rocked the markets in the past. In
December 1996, stocks nose-dived when the Fed chairman referred to
the market's ``irrational exuberance.''
</P>
<P>
   But Greenspan did raise new warning about today's stock price
levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors seem to be expecting that low inflation and stronger
productivity growth will allow the extraordinary growth of profits
to be extended into the distant future,'' Greenspan said. ``These
rising expectations have, in turn, driven stock prices sharply
higher and credit spreads lower, perhaps to levels that will be
difficult to sustain unless economic conditions remain
exceptionally favorable _ more so than might be anticipated from
historical relationships.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Long-term interest rates fell sharply Wednesday, as
the Asian financial crisis and continuing problems in Russia
apparently sent more foreigners to the haven of the American bond
market.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board,
helped the rally when he indicated, in an upbeat assessment of the
economy, that an interest-rate increase to slow economic growth was
not imminent.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the 30-year bond fell to 5.70 percent, just a tick
away from the 5.69 percent closing low it reached in January. That
yield for the 30-year bond was the lowest since the Treasury began
issuing the bonds in 1977. At the same time, yields on corporate
debt approached 30-year lows.
</P>
<P>
   Other interest rates, however, have not fallen back to their
January levels, which means that mortgage rates are still above the
four-year lows they reached at the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
   While Greenspan said that the American economy was ``still
enjoying a virtuous cycle,'' he also said the Asian crisis could
lead to a cut in earnings expectations, a key element in the
outlook for the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian crisis, he told Congress' Joint Economic Committee,
should lead to both a further dampening of American export sales
and a reduction in profit margins because of rising price pressures
from cheaper imports. Both developments would cut into earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market plunged in the afternoon, as Boeing Co. and
Lattice Semiconductor Corp. announced that the Asian problems were
worsening their earnings outlooks, emphasizing Greenspan's warning.
The Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500 stocks fell 6.13 points to
1,112.28, while the Nasdaq index dropped 27.51 points, or 1.5
percent, to 1,773.25. The Dow Jones industrial average, which has
suffered the least in the recent market downturn, fell 78.22
points, to 8,971.70.
</P>
<P>
   Although Greenspan raised the issue of earnings and the stock
market, he did not make any comments that appeared aimed at talking
the market down. He has tried that in the past only to see stocks
rally after an initial negative reaction.
</P>
<P>
   But in a contorted way _ something that a quick reading of his
remarks might miss _ Greenspan did say that a decline in stock
prices would help the central bank avoid an interest rate increase
because the fall would probably help curtail the consumer spending
that has helped propel the economy.
</P>
<P>
   In listing the factors that could help slow growth and obviate
the need for an interest-rate increase, Greenspan said, ``Reduced
prospects for the return to capital would not only affect
investment directly but could also affect consumption as stock
prices adjusted to a less optimistic view of earnings prospects.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts did not focus on this part of his remarks, however.
They were more taken by his positive outlook. He said that wages
had not risen as much as one would have suspected and that
productivity gains might offset inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sounded more optimistic about the long-run prospects of
keeping inflation down than in his previous testimony,'' said
Richard Berner, chief economist at the Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the surge in bond prices, which move in the opposite
direction of yields, came after stock markets dropped sharply in
Asia, showing that the economic turmoil there that helped push
interest rates to their January lows might be deepening. The price
of the 30-year bond rose 1 7/32 to 106 2/32, as the yield fell from
5.78 percent Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Hang Seng index in Hong Kong dropped 4.9 percent, to
7,979.26, a three-year low that brought it below the 8,121.06 low
it reached on Jan. 12, the same day that the 30-year bond yield
reached 5.69 percent. The Nikkei index in Japan dropped 1.2 percent
to 15,339.
</P>
<P>
   Also adding to concerns about the world's emerging markets was
the failure of the weekly Russian treasury bills sale. The
government needed to raise $1.1 billion to cover maturing issues
but received only $742 million, raising concerns about the
government's ability to pay its debts without new international
assistance. A key Russian stock index dropped 6.2 percent.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even though the yield on the 30-year bond is near its recent
lows, other interest rates are not nearly so low as they were in
January. For example, the yield on the 10-year note dropped to 5.50
percent Wednesday from 5.58 Tuesday. But it is still well above
January's 5.36 percent level, which is why mortgage rates have not
gone down to January levels.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Bank Rate Monitor, the average rate nationally
on a 30-year mortgage is 6.92 percent, still above the 6.87 percent
of mid-January.
</P>
<P>
   And short-term rates are so much higher than they were in
January that the 5.50 percent yield on the 10-year note Wednesday
was below that of the two-year note, 5.52 percent.
</P>
<P>
   One reason that short-term rates are high is that investors
still expect the Fed to raise its interest rates target sometime in
the next year. In January, when the yield on the two-year note
dropped to 5.17 percent, some expected the economy to slow enough
for the Fed to cut interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   In some circumstances, a move of short-term interest rates above
longer-term interest rates could signal that the economy will be
slowing down if the so-called inversion is caused by the Fed's
decision to raise its short-term interest-rate target.
</P>
<P>
   But in the current circumstances, the inversion is caused more
by a fall in longer-term rates that reflects positive views on
inflation and, therefore, it is not a warning signal, Berner said.

STUDY: CONSERVATION PLANS OFTEN BASED ON SHAKY SCIENCE,
UNCERTAINTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB TAYLOR  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Clinton Administration's trademark new approach to enforcing
the Endangered Species Act on millions of acres of private lands
has often relied on shaky science, a broad new study has found.
</P>
<P>
   The draft study, performed by 119 independent scientists with
National Science Foundation funding, highlights scientific
weaknesses in more than 200 Habitat Conservation Plans, which the
administration has fequently substituted for bans on disturbing
species protected by the Act.
</P>
<P>
   The plans are agreements between landowners and the federal
government. They allow the landowners to develop, mine, log _ or
otherwise use _ their property. In return, the landowners agree to
make habitat improvements that lessen the harm to the endangered
plants or animals.
</P>
<P>
   The plans have reshaped the way the Endangered Species Act is
enforced on about 5 million acres of state and private land, and
they're spreading rapidly. The areas covered by the habitat
conservation plans range from suburban sage-scrub brush of
gnatcatchers in Southern California to the red-cockaded
woodpecker's longleaf pine forests in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said he welcomed the study as
``innovative'' and ``helpful.'' He said it is spurring his agency
to rewrite guidelines for habitat planning.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the study concludes that the plans often lack
scientific support for conclusions that they would help at-risk
species. Plans commonly fail to assess how many protected plants or
animals would be disturbed, show how this would affect the species'
survival, or prescribe monitoring that will indicate how the
species actually fare, the study says.
</P>
<P>
   The problems stem, in part, from a lack of available scientific
data, according to the study, which also says that the estimates of
the plans' impact on senstivie species are, at times, ``very close
to a guess.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration contends the plans get owners of
private land, the site of 80 percent of endangered species habitat,
to preserve or improve habitat that otherwise might be lost.
</P>
<P>
   And large landowners, especially timber companies in the
Northwest, have come to enthusiastically embrace the plans. They
have negotiated or are working on agreements that would effect
about 11 million acres in Washington, Oregon California, Idaho and
Montana. That land includes one quarter of non-federal commercial
timberland in the region.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the plans have drawn mounting criticism from
environmental groups and some conservation biologists.
</P>
<P>
   A draft of the new study, obtained by the Post-Intelligencer,
supported some of those complaints. It found:
</P>
<P>
   _ No estimates regarding the number of at-risk plants or animals
killed or disrupted by the authorized plans were done for about
two-thirds of the species covered.
</P>
<P>
   _ Inadequate assessment of the impact of those losses on the
species' survival was ``especially common.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Almost two-thirds of the plans fail to show that the
improvements minimize damage to the species as much as is
practicable, as the Endangered Species Act requires.
</P>
<P>
   _ Less than 10 percent of the plans ``had clear monitoring
programs that were sufficient for evaluating success.''
</P>
<P>
   _ About 25 percent of the plans fail to assess whether habitat
is currently sufficient to support recovery of the species or what
cumulative impacts would result from piecemeal loss of habitat.
</P>
<P>
   _ The agency has been negotiating plans that last as long as 100
years, with guarantees that no further concessions will be asked,
without regard to uncertainties about whether they will provide
adequate species protection.
</P>
<P>
   Laverne Smith, chief of Interior's Division of Endangered
Species, declined to respond to any of the draft's specific
criticisms. She said a formal response is being drafted.
</P>
<P>
   The study, which eclipses previous habitat planning reviews in
both depth and scope, was coordinated by the National Center for
Ecological Analysis and Synthesis at the University of California
at Santa Barbara with financial assistance from the National
Science Foundation and the American Institute for Biological
Sciences. The scientists from eight universities evaluated 208 of
227 habitat plans, with an in-depth look at 43 of them.
</P>
<P>
   Though still subject to revisions, the draft study expands on
findings reported in December. At that time, Peter Kareiva, the
University of Washington ecologist who supervised the study, said,
``There are a huge number of Habitat Conservatin Plans (HCPs) that
probably should not have been written.'' Kareiva could not be
reached for comment on the latest version of the report.
</P>
<P>
   The White House announced in February it intends to improve HCP
guidelines. Interior Department officials have been working on
language to require plans to have clear monitoring programs,
measurable biological goals and more public review. And, where
information is lacking, the government is seeking shorter duration
and more clauses that would force landowners to tighten safeguards
if new species problems developed.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Babbitt dismissed many of the problems as
necessary growing pains for a new program. ``Obviously, this stuff
is all new and we're cutting it out of whole cloth,'' Babbitt said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a couple hundred HCPs. Now, what we have to do is go
back and look at all of them and see if there are lessons we can
learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials noted that the plans cannot be delayed for
perfect data and are negotiated compromises, not pure science.
</P>
<P>
   The study follows mounting criticism from other quarters. In
1996, 167 scientists complained about the plans' lack of
independent scientific review and warned they ``have the potential
to become habitat giveaways that contribute to, rather than
alleviate, threats to listed species and their habitats.''
</P>
<P>
   Several environmental groups and members of congress have also
raised concerns. ``Giving it all away'' is what a coalition of
Northwest environmental groups last year called a review of the
plans.
</P>
<P>
   One notable exception to the environmental group critics is
Michael Bean of the Environmental Defense Fund, a highly regarded
expert on on U.S. wildlife law. Bean agrees that some of the plans
are ``lousy,'' but says they can produce net gains.
</P>
<P>
   ``HCPs have the potential to produce results that are far better
than we could otherwise expect,'' he said, especially where human
intervention is needed to restore habitat or combat an invasive
exotic species.

WISCONSIN SAYS STATE MONEY CAN BE USED FOR RELIGIOUS SCHOOLS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Ariz. Vt., Maine)   By ETHAN BRONNER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the most significant legal decision yet on the growing use of
school vouchers, the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that
the city of Milwaukee could spend taxpayer money to send pupils to
parochial or other religious schools.
</P>
<P>
   Voting 4-2 to overturn a lower-court ruling, the state's highest
court said that the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program did not
violate Wisconsin's existing ban on spending state funds for
religious seminaries or the First Amendment's separation of church
and state. The court said the program ``has a secular purpose'' and
``will not have the primary effect of advancing religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Hasson, president of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty
in Washington, a public interest law firm promoting the free
expression of religious traditions, said the decision ``is the
latest example of the fact that common sense is returning to the
law of religious liberty.'' Hasson added, &QL; 
``Courts no longer see religion as an allergen in the body politic
but as a normal part of life in society.''
</P>
<P>
   Civil libertarians, aghast at what they considered a radical
departure in court interpretation of the First Amendment, and
teacher's unions, lamenting the ruling as a blow to public schools,
vowed an appeal to the United States Supreme Court. Some legal
scholars said that the decision could form the basis of a test case
for the U.S. Supreme Court on the extent to which government can
support parental choice in using public money to buy a religious
school education.
</P>
<P>
   By the rules of Milwaukee's Parental Choice Program, begun in
1990 and the first of the country's voucher programs, families
below a certain income level can send their children to the school
of their choice _ public or private, kindergarten through 12th
grade _ with tuition paid by the state government.
</P>
<P>
   When religious schools were added to the list of choices in
1995, a change aimed at vastly increasing the program's size
because Milwaukee has so many more parochial schools than private
schools, the plan was challenged by the civil libertarians and
teachers groups. Agreeing with them, a lower state court limited
the program to private, nonsectarian schools.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,500 children currently attend 23 private, nonsectarian
schools in Milwaukee at public expense under the program. With the
expansion approved by the court Wednesday, about 13,500 additional
poor students of the city's 100,000 public school children will be
able to choose a parochial school starting in September. Already,
81 religious schools in the city have registered to participate.

 AMERICAN PEACE ACTIVISTS BEATEN, ARRESTED IN jERUSALEM 
(For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ A group of American peace activists were beaten and
five were arrested by club-wielding Israeli police Wednesday during
a demonstration against Jewish settlements in Arab neighborhoods of
East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said the demonstration began as a peaceful protest
with some 60 US activists, including six from Massachusetts, and
dozens of Palestinian and Israeli supporters staging a sit-in.
</P>
<P>
   Singing ``We Shall Overcome,'' the demonstrators gathered in the
yard of one of four houses that Jewish settlers occupied on Monday
in the Palestinian neighborhood of Silwan, just outside the walls
of the Old City.
</P>
<P>
   The protest quickly became a violent confrontation, witnesses
said, after Israeli police, using batons, forced the demonstrators
to disperse. Some were dragged by their hair into custody.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Murray, 52, of Cambridge, a member of the Boston Committee
on the Middle East who was in Jerusalem for a human rights
conference, said, ``It was unbelievable. We were sitting on the
ground in a completely peaceful demonstration and the police began
beating people and dragging them out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Settlers came running at us with machine guns, shouting and
threatening us,'' added Murray, who said that she and 20 other
protesters suffered cuts and bruises.
</P>
<P>
   One demonstrator was hospitalized. It was not clear last night
whether charges would be brought against the five who were arrested
and detained.
</P>
<P>
   A police spokeswoman told Reuters, ``Police asked the crowd to
disperse but once they did not comply, the police used reasonable
force.''
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli settlement group Elad has said that it legally
bought the houses, although the protesters say the group took over
the homes in the night armed with machine guns and illegally
evicted Palestinian tenants who were living there.
</P>
<P>
   According to Elad, Silwan, where today some 30,000 Palestinians
live, was the location of King David's ancient palace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the home of King David, he wrote the Psalms here, and
here Jews are not allowed to live?'' asked Elad spokesman Yehuda
Malik.
</P>
<P>
   Israel captured East Jerusalem in the 1967 Six Day War and later
annexed it. Israel's taking of East Jerusalem has been condemned by
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Israel sees Jerusalem as its ``permanent and
indivisible'' capital. Palestinians see East Jerusalem as the site
of a capital for a future state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should these Palestinians, who have lived in Jerusalem for
hundreds of years, be evicted from their homes so that Jews from
Brooklyn can live in them?'' asked protester Norman Finkelstein of
New York.

   ``We have 125 students eligible and waiting for vouchers,'' said
Brother Bob Smith, principal of Messmer High School, a Roman
Catholic school, which serves a mainly black and Hispanic section
of Milwaukee. ``We're going to have a capacity problem but it's a
good problem to have.''
</P>
<P>
   Voucher programs are sprouting up around the country because of
discontent with the public school systems, especially in urban
areas that serve the poor. In such areas, the main alternative to
public schools are those run by churches, and experts said that the
Wisconsin decision, if repeated elsewhere, could remove the biggest
obstacle to such plans.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a group of business leaders, saying they hoped to
move public schools to improve, pledged to raise $200 million for a
national voucher program that would permit at least 50,000 poor,
public-school students to attend parochial and other private
schools over the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   Four other states _ Ohio, Arizona, Vermont and Maine _ have
cases similar to Milwaukee's pending in their state courts. The
winners in Wisconsin said the ruling provided the other programs
with rationale and momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's decision will help school choice spread like wildfire
across the nation,'' said Chip Mellor, president of Institute for
Justice, a Washington-based conservative public policy law firm and
one of the major litigators. ``The court's careful analysis of the
constitutional issues provides powerful insight that voucher
programs are fully compatible with the principles of the First
Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Lynn, executive director of the Americans United for
Separation of Church and State, which helped bring the lawsuit
enjoining the program's implementation, said the decision would be
appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taxpayers shouldn't be forced to pay for religious schools,''
Lynn said. ``The principal purpose of a religious school is to
spread its teachings, whether they be the Gospel of Jesus Christ or
the words of Mohammed. They are specific teachings from ministries
of religious denominations. We are not throwing in the towel.''
</P>
<P>
   Phil Baum, of the American Jewish Congress, who was upset by the
ruling, said he foresaw ``a possible landmark U.S. Supreme Court
decision.'' Baum said the high court would soon be confronted with
a fundamental choice: ``to preserve the principal that the
Constitution imposes stringent and special restrictions on
government funding of religion _ a policy which has allowed
religion and religious liberty to flourish _ or to embark on an
uncharted course, and put at risk the religious liberty Americans
enjoy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Feldman, president of the American Federation of
Teachers, called it ``unconscionable to give public funds to
private religious schools for just a few students, when those same
tax dollars could be put into proven, public-school programs that
would benefit every child in Milwaukee.''
</P>
<P>
   The advocates of voucher programs say that one of its great
benefits is to force public school systems to face their failings
and improve.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor John Norquist of Milwaukee said the ruling would lead to
higher quality public schools because ``the district won't be able
to take kids for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the old system, if it failed, it didn't matter.'' Mayor
Norquist said. ``The only real penalty a school district paid was
that people with money went to the suburbs. But lower-income kids
were captive.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, advocates for publicly financed vouchers said
that the Wisconsin decision revived at least the prospect that such
programs might be tested someday in the city's poorest
neighborhoods. But they said it was far too soon to know whether
anyone would propose such a program.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1996, in response to a challenge from John
Cardinal O'Connor, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani had briefly considered
using tax dollars to send 1,000 low-performing public-school
students to parochial schools, saying he was confident he could
defend such a program before the United States Supreme Court. But
he quickly retreated, saying that such a plan would be ``clearly
illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   The program that later resulted, which has so far awarded
four-year scholarships to parochial or other private schools to
2,200 New York City public-school children, was financed entirely
by corporate and other private donations.
</P>
<P>
   Some scholars who have been watching the legal battles over
vouchers expressed surprise that the Wisconsin judges went beyond
state constitutional questions and directly addressed the First
Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big surprise that they took on the First Amendment,''
said Joseph Viteritti, a professor of public administration at New
York University, who is writing a book on school choice. Viteritti
said the key to Wednesday's ruling was the court's view that the
voucher money went to the parents rather than the schools and that
its purpose was neutral with regard to religion.
</P>
<P>
   He and other scholars who favor school choice said the Wisconsin
decision was well-grounded in the past two decades of high court
decisions on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Few issues have been as divisive or murky at the Supreme Court
as the meaning of the First Amendment's assertion that ``Congress
shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or
prohibiting the free exercise thereof.''
</P>
<P>
   The mandate, which applies equally to state legislatures by
virtue of the 14th Amendment, has, since a 1971 high court case,
been interpreted to mean that a law must pass a three-prong test:
it has a secular purpose; its primary effect neither advances nor
inhibits religion; it does not create excessive entanglement
between government and religion.''
</P>
<P>
   The 68-page ruling of the Wisconsin Supreme Court said the
Milwaukee school choice program met all three criteria. The two
dissenting judges, including Chief Justice Shirley Abrahamson, did
not take issue with that portion of the decision. In a short
paragraph the dissenters said simply that they agreed with the
appellate court decision saying the program violated Wisconsin's
constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The program has a provision prohibiting a private school from
requiring a student attending it to participate in any religious
activity if the pupil's parent or guardian submits a written
request that he or she be exempted.
</P>
<P>
   That did not satisfy the plan's opponents, who said religious
indoctrination would occur anyway. Gov. Tommy Thompson of
Wisconsin, a long-standing proponent of school vouchers, said
Wednesday: ``Religious values aren't our problem. Drop-out rates
and low test scores are.''

 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the anti-smoking issue came before Congress
last year, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott had an ethical
problem: his brother-in-law Richard Scruggs was one of the lawyers
who had negotiated the tobacco settlement and stood to make
millions from any legislation.
</P>
<P>
   So to avoid conflict, Lott turned the issue over to others, and
to this day he carefully votes ``present'' on any amendments that
might affect the lawyers' fees that might come out of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   But as the man who controls the Senate floor and searches for
the Republican consensus, he has now emerged as one of the critical
political players who will determine the fate of anti-tobacco
legislation this year. As the Mississippi Republican himself has
said, ``You can't really recuse yourself from being the majority
leader.''
</P>
<P>
   So on some days, he proclaims the tobacco legislation to be near
death. On others, he seeks to smooth the way for conservatives to
sweeten the tobacco bill with tax cut and anti-drug amendments that
might help them swallow it.
</P>
<P>
   It is quite plain that he does not like the bill's $516 billion
cost to the tobacco industry. It is equally clear that he
recognizes the perils to many Republicans of looking like pawns of
tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   What is not altogether clear to his colleagues is whether Lott
has a carefully plotted strategy, that he sees around corners and
anticipates where he wants to be three amendments from now.
</P>
<P>
   Characteristically, as he deals, the buttoned-down 56-year-old
Lott has kept his ultimate intentions to himself. Even his closest
aides refuse to guess whether he will push the bill to completion.
</P>
<P>
   But how he maneuvers the Senate and judges the needs of his
sharply divided Republican conference in these coming days will
help determine whether Congress ends the year with bipartisan
legislation or a campaign issue. And for all Lott's grousing about
the bill, and all the obstacles and uncertainty still ahead, those
who want the Senate to give momentum to an anti-smoking bill this
year tentatively count him as working with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've concluded that Senator Lott isn't wild about this bill,''
said Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle. ``But I've also concluded
that I think he would like to see some closure.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who drafted the tobacco bill, said:
``I don't have a doubt that he wants a bill at the end of the day.
At the same time, he is cognizant that there are not many
legislative days left.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Lott has never been quite as distant from the tobacco
issue as he has seemed. In 1996, Scruggs, who was helping the state
of Mississippi sue the tobacco companies for Medicaid costs, called
and asked his brother-in-law whether it was possible that Congress
would sanction a national settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Lott, Republican aides and lobbyists said, suggested that
Scruggs use two Republicans _ John Sears, a former member of the
Nixon administration, and Tommy Anderson, a former chief of staff
to Lott _ as intermediaries to approach the tobacco industry and
see if it would be interested in reaching a deal with its
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican official familiar with Lott's thinking said his
original interest stemmed from his philosophical opposition to
bringing down an industry that had been manufacturing a legal
product. He was also was aware that tobacco was turning into a
political issue that could become difficult for Republicans,
because they have traditionally received the bulk of campaign
contributions from the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   It was in 1996 that President Clinton, as part of his
re-election campaign, first began taking high-profile stands in
favor of fighting smoking among the young through federal
regulation of tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 contacts that Lott helped put in motion produced an
early proposal that the tobacco companies pay the states $150
billion over 15 years. That effort died.
</P>
<P>
   But those first contacts grew into the process, watched over by
the White House, that eventually produced the proposed tobacco
settlement under which the industry would pay $368.5 billion in
fines and fees and institute measures against smoking by young
people in exchange for legal protection.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment that plan was brought before the Senate, it
posed problems for Republicans. Democrats sensed a political
bonanza, an issue on which they could stand for activist government
and protecting the health of teen-agers. But the Republican Party
fractured between those who felt they needed to take a strong stand
against the tobacco companies and those who had a philosophical
objection to a measure that they saw as a Big government approach
to a social problem and one that would impose a large tax on
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   And Lott has his own special problem because of Scruggs, one of
a small group of private lawyers whom states hired to sue the
tobacco companies because they lacked the legal resources
themselves. Those lawyers took the cases on contingent fees, and
when the states won verdicts in the billions, the lawyers stood to
gain hundreds of millions of dollars. Scruggs himself stands to
share in $4.5 billion in state fees. Many lawmakers have sought to
curtail the lawyers' fees severely.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the bill that McCain crafted as chairman of the
Commerce Committee became even worse for the tobacco companies,
costing $516 billion over 25 years and containing far fewer legal
protections for the companies than the original bill.
</P>
<P>
   Lott did not participate in the drafting, and his press
secretary, Susan Irby, says he will ``probably'' not vote on final
passage of the bill. But by proxy he cast his vote in committee in
favor of the bill. He said later he was doing so only to keep the
process moving and to put the issue on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   As the debate now moves into its third week, Lott faces a
particularly difficult balancing act. For one thing, Senate
Republicans have no unity on the issue. ``It's not just black or
white, or red or brown,'' said Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio. ``We have
shades of where people are on this bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott's political base in the Senate has been among
conservatives. Yet conservatives such as Sen. Don Nickles of
Oklahoma, Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, and Sen. John Aschcroft of
Missouri _ who sings in a barbershop quarter with Lott _ are the
ones most adamantly opposed to the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Lott has made clear that he believes the true tobacco
legislation, if there is any eventually, will be written in a
House-Senate conference committee. The House, even more adamant
against McCain's legislation, is expected to write a stripped down
bill to deter teen-age smoking. That will allow the drafting in
essence to start all over again.
</P>
<P>
   But the question remains of whether the Senate will manage to
get a bill to the conference. Monday, Lott said, ``There's a point,
you know, at which you say this thing is not, you know, capable of
being resurrected.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the legislation's prospects seemed to improve this
week, Daschle said Wednesday morning, ``Anybody that would declare
victory today would be a fool.''

DAMAGE-AWARDS BILL HAS NEW BACKER 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Wash.)  ( dc ) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A far-reaching measure that would set nationwide
limits on damages awarded in court for faulty products received a
significant boost Wednesday as a leading Senate opponent said he
would now support a version of the law proposed by the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., said he would support the bill,
which would set nationwide standards on damage awards to people
harmed by faulty products as diverse as microwave ovens and cardiac
pacemakers.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Gorton backed out of a White House plan, ending the
possibility of a compromise. But Gorton said through a spokeswoman
that he now regarded the compromise proposal as ``a good start.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of limiting liability has been pushed by a coalition
of manufacturers for more than two decades. But Gorton, the chief
Republican spokesman on the issue, said last year that the bill
proposed by President Clinton did not provide enough relief,
because some benefits applied only to small companies.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which was taken off the legislative calendar at the
end of 1997 might now be voted on in the Senate next month. It
would limit punitive damages available to someone harmed by a
flawed product manufactured by a company of fewer than 25 employees
to $250,000 or twice that person's actual damages.

3 MORE VICTIMS OF GRAIN ELEVATOR BLAST ARE FOUND
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By DIRK JOHNSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA, Kan. _ For all the poetry of Kansas wheatfields swaying
in the breeze, the laborers who worked inside the big DeBruce Grain
elevator knew a job that could be brutish: dirty and low paying
work often done by Mexican immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   It was not an easy way to live. And for some, it was a violent
way to die.
</P>
<P>
   Fire and rescue crews Wednesday uncovered the remains of three
more victims inside the grain storage facility that exploded
Monday, bringing the death toll to five. Meanwhile, searchers
continued looking for one man still trapped in tunnels in the
wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the dimming chances of survival, officials Wednesday
expressed hope that the remaining worker might somehow still be
found alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is air in those tunnels,'' said Ken Cox, division chief
of the Sedgwick County Fire Department. ``So breathing would not be
a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The search was temporarily halted Wednesday afternoon when a
rescue worker slipped and was buried to his armpits in grain,
before being pulled to safety by other crew members.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies found Wednesday had not been identified. And
officials did not disclose the precise cause of death. Two victims
killed instantly on Monday were Jose Prajedes Ortiz, 24, and Jose
luis Duarte, 41. The others missing the explosion were Howard Goin,
Noel Najera, Victor Castaneda and Raymundo Diz-Vela. Six others
were seriously injured, including some who were badly burned.
</P>
<P>
   The DeBruce Grain elevator, one of the biggest, free-standing
storage facilities in the nation, has been cited at least twice in
the last 19 months by federal warehouse inspectors for excessive
grain-dust conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said that the company in both cases vowed to
clean up the dust, which can be flammable.
</P>
<P>
   The DeBruce facility, which towers over the flat prairie about
five miles south of Witchita, bears little resemblance to the
small, quaint wooden grain elevators found in so many farm towns of
the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it is a series of cement silos that stand 120-feet
tall, with tunnels that extend 800 feet, and has a storage capacity
of about 21 million bushels of grain. The DeBruce company buys
grain from farmers and smaller elevators, then ships it to mills.
</P>
<P>
   Grain is stored and extracted from the elevator by conveyor
belts that run the length of the facility. The huge giant silos,
which stand aside a freight rail line, had vast sections knocked
away, with some holes bigger than cars.
</P>
<P>
   The men inside the tunnels, which are 7 feet by 8 feet, were
working on the maintenance crew at the time of the explosion, a
series of jolts that shook homes 10 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Explosions in grain elevators are caused by the mixing of grain
dust and oxygen in closed quarters. The spark for the fire can come
from an electrical short, or the cutting of some metal. Rather than
a single blast, the explosion sets off a ripple of explosions.
</P>
<P>
   There have been 10 grain-dust explosions in Kansas in the last
10 years, but no deaths. Low-level jobs at grain elevators
typically pay $5 or $6 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Working inside the tunnels can be dirty, even disgusting,
according to people familiar with grain elevators, places filled
with strong odors and scrambling mice.
</P>
<P>
   Paul DeBruce, the chief executive of the Kansas City-based
company, said during a news conference on Tuesday that he had
invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in the facility, much of
it for equipment to contain grain dust. DeBruce purchased the grain
elevator in 1996 for $1.15 million.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 searchers were combing through the wreckage of the
elevator, including local fire crews and representatives from the
Federal Emergence Management Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the friends and families of the victims gathered at the
Oatville Elementary School, about a mile from the grain elevator,
where the Red Cross and other volunteers were helping them cope.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz, one of those who died, was recalled by family and friends
as a hard worker who loved life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always happy, always wanting to go dancing, to hold his
baby and be with his friends,'' said his widow, Claudia Ortiz.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz had moved to Kansas from Mexico about five years ago.
Known for his trademark black cowboy hat, Ortiz loved to sit
outside and talk with friends, as he held his 6-month-old baby,
Saul, on his lap.
</P>
<P>
   DeBruce said the workday Monday was proceeding as usual before
the blast. He said Goin was greasing bearings in the tunnel, while
the other three men were cleaning up spilled grain. The executive
said he had known Goin, who is in his 60s, since 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Goin had recently retired, but came back to help at the grain
elevator during the busy wheat harvest season.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they had detected no signs of life since some
thudding noises about 2 a.m. Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The division fire chief, Cox, said the spilled grain posed
hazards to the searchers, since it could swallow a person like
quicksand. But he said none of the workers, which included
firefighters from Oklahoma City, expressed any desire to be taken
off the dangerous assignment.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the families of the dead and missing have been told
about the work of the rescue crews.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're saying prayers for the rescuers, too,'' he said. &QL;

HOUSE PANEL DEFERS TO CRIMINAL PROBE OF REP. SHUSTER
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS BLACK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House ethics committee announced Wednesday that
it has curtailed its investigation of Transportation Committee
Chairman Bud Shuster in deference to a Justice Department criminal
probe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Department of Justice has indicated that its ongoing
criminal investigation may relate to matters similar to those under
investigation by the committee,'' said the one-paragraph statement
issued by the committee formally known as the House Committee on
Standards of Official Conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Shuster's lawyer said there was no indication the Pennsylvania
Republican had become a target of the investigation by US Attorney
Donald Stern in Boston into alleged corruption involving Boston's
$10 billion Central Artery depression project. Stern's office
declined to comment on the ethics committee announcement.
</P>
<P>
   The committee has agreed to refrain from conducting interviews
and deposing witnesses in connection with its investigation of
Shuster and his relationship with lobbyist Ann M. Eppard, who was
his top congressional aide for 20 years and remains his top
campaign fund-raiser. The committee may continue to issue and
enforce subpoenas for documents on the case.
</P>
<P>
   A federal grand jury in Boston returned a seven-count indictment
on bribery, corruption, and income tax evasion charges against
Eppard in April. The indictment charged her with accepting $230,000
in payments from a lobbyist working on behalf of two Boston
property owners whose property was threatened by the Big Dig. She
has denied the charges, and Shuster has denounced them as
political.
</P>
<P>
   Shuster was an early supporter of the massive Big Dig project.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to Shuster believe investigators were concerned an
offer of congressional immunity in return for Eppard's testimony
could damage the case pending against her. The grand jury has
subpoenaed documents from the committee, but the panel fought that
request.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Delinsky, one of Shuster's Boston lawyers, said the
ethics committee action does not suggest that Shuster is in any
legal trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not,'' he said. ``My understanding is the United
States has absolutely no case against Bud Shuster because he did
nothing wrong, and the US attorney himself said in a public
statement that Bud Shuster is not directly or indirectly implicated
in any pending indictment.''
</P>
<P>
   Delinsky added, ``Bud Shuster has cooperated 100 percent with
the ethics committee investigation. He expects to be fully
vindicated in that investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Shuster, Scott Brenner, said, ``We are very
pleased with the ethics committee's decision concerning the
complaint filed against the congressman. ... This is exactly what
we requested from the ethics committee on March 27.''

LEWINSKY IMMUNITY DEAL SAID TO BE FAVORED BY BOTH SIDES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As they renewed their negotiations over a possible
immunity agreement, prosecutors and the lawyers for Monica Lewinsky
have two things in common: Each side wants evidence from the other
and each side would prefer an immunity deal to an indictment,
lawyers and others involved in the inquiry said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Those forces could ultimately lead to the kind of agreement that
would prove troublesome for President Clinton, although the lawyers
said that the negotiations had only just begun when Ms. Lewinsky's
lawyers met on Tuesday with Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   While the issue was apparently not raised in Tuesday's
discussions, Ms. Lewinsky's legal team has long sought the details
of conversations involving Ms. Lewinsky that were secretly recorded
by Linda Tripp, a former colleague at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors, meanwhile, have repeatedly asked to interview Ms.
Lewinsky in order to measure her demeanor and credibility before
approving any kind of immunity deal in which she could become the
main witness for the prosecution in any further proceedings. The
prosecutors have also sought more information from Ms. Lewinsky
about a three-page document she handed Ms. Tripp that provided
talking points about what to say when she was subpoenaed in the
Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky conferred with her new Washington lawyers again
Wednesday. The Tuesday meeting outlined a framework for further
discussions between the prosecutors and Ms. Lewinsky's lawyers,
Plato Cacheris and Jacob Stein, who replaced William Ginsburg after
he was unable to secure an immunity agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The talking-points memorandum and the Tripp-Lewinsky tapes form
the backbone of the independent counsel's inquiry into whether
anyone lied or obstructed justice over Ms. Lewinsky's relationship
with Clinton. The tapes reportedly contradict the affidavit given
by Ms. Lewinsky to Mrs. Jones' lawyers, in which Ms. Lewinsky said
she never had a sexual relationship with the president. The tapes
are also said to contain Ms. Lewinsky's pleadings that Ms. Tripp
lie under oath about Ms. Lewinsky's relationship in the Jones
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   But the full details of the 20 hours of tapes have never been
made public and no one aside from Ms. Tripp and the independent
counsel's office knows what else they might reveal or how damaging
they might be.
</P>
<P>
   Starr is also examining whether anyone has taken steps to
intimidate Ms. Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, a federal grand jury in Alexandria, Va., took
testimony from Harold Ickes, a former top White House aide who
remains an adviser to Clinton, about the improper disclosure by the
Pentagon of details from Ms. Tripp's personnel file, according to
lawyers involved in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Bacon, the Pentagon's top spokesman, has acknowledged
that he erred in releasing details from Ms. Tripp's file to The New
Yorker magazine. A statement from Ms. Tripp in her personnel file
said that she had never been arrested, though The New Yorker
disclosed that she had been arrested once as a teen-ager. Bacon has
said he acted on his own and did not release the material following
any requests from the White House or any of his superiors at the
Defense Department.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ickes, a former White House deputy chief of staff, has
acknowledged that he might have asked Bacon about Ms. Tripp before
Bacon disclosed the material from her personnel record. Ickes has
not received any notification that he is anything other than a
witness in the inquiry, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's new legal team was described Wednesday as being
unhappy about a recent spread of photographs in Vanity Fair
magazine, featuring their client in a series of seductive poses and
on a beach in Malibu, Calif., wearing an outfit reminiscent of
Marilyn Monroe's. The pictures appeared to undermine the image of
Ms. Lewinsky that she and her parents have tried to convey: a
young, former White House intern, victimized by circumstances and
hounded by the paparazzi.
</P>
<P>
   The photographs, for which she was not paid, were arranged by
Ginsburg and approved by her father, Bernard Lewinsky.

WHATEVER HAPPENED TO JERRY BUSS?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN 
c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I have a disturbing confession to make.
</P>
<P>
   I'm worried about my old pal, Jerry Buss.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   Because he's no longer Jerry Buss.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure, as some are saying, that he's metamorphosed into
Donald T Sterling.
</P>
<P>
   But he's not Jerry Buss, either.
</P>
<P>
   No way.
</P>
<P>
   The Jerry Buss I've always known has been the most generous
owner in the NBA, a guy who would unlock his bank vault to win a
world championship for his Lakers, a philanthropist who'd give
Magic Johnson five percent of his team and James Worthy a $12
million going-away gift.
</P>
<P>
   The Jerry Buss I've always known would rather stand up one of
his 21-year-old starlet girlfriends on a date than allow a valued
employee, Jerry West, to become so unhappy that's he's threatening
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   The Jerry Buss I've known since 1979, the Jerry Buss I've sat
with umpteen times in his private Forum box during Laker games, the
Jerry Buss I laughed with and kidded with and played cards with in
the early morning hours on so many occasions in the Forum press
lounge, the Jerry Buss I partied with in various Beverly Hills
nightclubs during the 1980s, would never get himself into a money
beef with Jerry West.
</P>
<P>
   Never!
</P>
<P>
   Who is this impostor passing himself off as Jerry Buss, long the
most beloved athletic owner in L.A. because of his well-documented
willingness to do what it takes to win world titles for the Lakers?
</P>
<P>
   Should the Inglewood cops be summoned to check this guy's
fingerprints for identification?
</P>
<P>
   I know that Jerry Buss is now in his mid 60s and that aging does
do funny things to people I myself have no idea who that stranger
is that stares back at me when I look into a mirror these harrowing
days but there is no way the Jerry Buss I've known all these years
would offend Jerry West in any manner.
</P>
<P>
   But he has.
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly, the proud Laker organization that Jerry Buss has so
nobly overseen soon could blow asunder if Jerry West indeed does
leave in a huff, which could have a falling dominos effect of
Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant following West out the door.
</P>
<P>
   And all Jerry Buss has to do to rectify this festering problem
is to give Jerry West the $2.3 million he's seeking, which really
isn't that much for a guy whose net profit from his team's $100
million gross earnings the past season probably exceeded $30
million.
</P>
<P>
   To condense a long and convoluted soap opera, Buss offered West
a $5 million bonus a while back for the exemplary work West has
done for him across the years, especially for the vital role he
played in rebuilding the post-Magic Johnson-Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
Lakers with the signing of O'Neal and the drafting of Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   This was a sporting gesture that was typical of the Jerry Buss I
once knew, although Buss did defer payment of the amount to West
across seven years, which in essence diluted the monetary value of
the bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry West, whose $1.25 million annual salary ranks him in the
middle of the pack of NBA executives even though he's considered
the shrewdest judge of talent in the league, told Buss last
November that he would like the remainder of his bonus in one
payment.
</P>
<P>
   Buss surprisingly said he'd think about it.
</P>
<P>
   The two men met a couple of weeks ago to discuss the same
situation.
</P>
<P>
   Buss said he'd get back to West on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   But Buss still hasn't made up his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry West has.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Buss coughs up that $2.3 million he owes West, the
60-year-old West will announce his retirement on August 31 from a
team he has worked for since 1960.
</P>
<P>
   And even if Buss does decide to give West what he's worth, West
probably will fulfill the final year of his Laker contract as a
consultant instead of a hands-on administrator making all the
team's decisions.
</P>
<P>
   You see, this version of Jerry Buss doesn't even listen to Jerry
West's advice any longer.
</P>
<P>
   If Buss did, Mitch Richmond would have been throwing up jump
shots for the Lakers against the Utah Jazz instead of Eddie Jones.
</P>
<P>
   And I'm not sure Del Harris would be returning as the Lakers'
coach next season, either.
</P>
<P>
   Harris still might not, but Harris has a year left on a contract
that pays him more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure this guy impersonating Jerry Buss is willing to
take such a financial hit, especially since he's been so willing to
keep Jerry West in a perpetual state of distress over a money
matter.
</P>
<P>
   I just don't know what to make out of this ringer passing
himself off as Jerry Buss.
</P>
<P>
   I'm keeping my fingers solemnly crossed that Jerry Buss hasn't
been seized by the dreaded Pat Riley Personality Transformation
Syndrome (named after the celebrated former Laker coach who
overnight went from being a friendly, gracious, open, amiable
fellow to an arrogant, paranoid, uptight, secretive,
philosophy-spewing boor who takes himself far too seriously).
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Buss still smilingly says hello to me and I haven't
spotted any arrogance in his demeanor, but I'm certain this guy is
disguised to look like Jerry Buss.
</P>
<P>
   The Jerry Buss I've always known never gave even the faintest
hint of acting like Donald T Sterling.

 &HT;    Naming no names, Baptists urge morality
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Southern Baptists urged Americans to consider
character when evaluating the performance of public officials, but
defeated an attempt to single out President Clinton, a fellow
Southern Baptist, in the resolution they adopted at their annual
convention.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution mentions ``serious allegation'' about ``moral and
legal misconduct by certain public officials.'' An amendment
proposed by a California pastor, the Rev. Wiley Drake, would have
added ``William Jefferson Clinton in particular.''
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Whitehead, chairman of the convention's resolutions
committee and a vice president at Midwestern Theological Seminary
in Kansas City, said ``including personalities would blunt the
message.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people will say, ``These shoes fit Bill Clinton,''
Whitehead said. ``But as our committee talked about this, we
realized there are scores of people on both ends of Pennsylvania
Avenue whom these shoes fit.''
</P>
<P>
   The resolution was directed at citizens to disregard charges of
immorality ``as long as economic prosperity prevails,'' he added.

 &HT;    Waiting for the rain to reign
 &HT;    By Moni Basu
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALCUTTA, India -- Every morning at 7, Gita Bashak bathes,
before the water reservoir is warmed by the sun, and sits down at
her altar to pray. For the last three weeks, her prayers have been
unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have asked for rain every day,'' Bashak, 47, said. ``Without
fail. Every morning I ask the gods for relief. Sometimes I look out
of the veranda at the cloudy skies and think that, yes, today, the
gods will hear me. But where? Where is the rain? This is just
unbearable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This'' in Calcutta on Wednesday meant a high temperature of
108 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   That coupled with 94 percent humidity has left this city of 11
million reeling in a relentless onslaught of heat.
</P>
<P>
   It has not been this hot on the Indian subcontinent in 50 years.
Blame it on the Gods or on El Nino or, as some joked, the
controversial recent series of nuclear tests in the northwestern
desert region, but the whole country is suffering.
</P>
<P>
   More than 2,500 people have died heat-related deaths so far.
Unless the monsoons arrive immediately, more are likely to perish.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, by the first week of June, the monsoons, the result of
a unique weather pattern that develops in the Indian ocean, cross
the subcontinent into the Bay of Bengal. The storms then turn
inland, unloading torrential rain and putting an end to a
blistering Calcutta summer.
</P>
<P>
   This year, though, the monsoons are late. Way late.
</P>
<P>
   Calcutta had considered itself lucky compared to New Delhi, the
capital, which has posted highs of 120-plus degrees. But now the
rains have arrived in other parts of the nation, pushing the
mercury down while Calcuttans are still waiting for relief. No one
here remembers it being this hot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been here all my life and I have never felt it like
this,'' said Bipul Naskar, a 28-year-old domestic worker. ``I am
having to change my shirt five times a day. A bath is useless,
because five minutes later, you are soaked again with sweat.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the inside of your house feeling like Turner Field at an
afternoon Braves game in August. Or consider trying to sleep at
night inside the sauna at your favorite gym. It is 10 degrees
warmer here than it was on the hottest part of the afternoon on the
hottest day of the Atlanta Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Bustling Calcutta streets are desolate at midday with most shop
windows shuttered. To ward off the pavement heat, water-soaked jute
mats hang on the doors and windows of state-run establishments,
which cannot afford air conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   For most out in the sun, beating the heat means a few minutes
sipping lukewarm Coca-Colas at corner stands and covering their
heads with wet handkerchiefs.
</P>
<P>
   Not even a shower is that refreshing: The tap water at 3 in the
afternoon is hot enough to brew a cup of tea.
</P>
<P>
   The normally lush stalls at neighborhood markets are now filled
with yellow and wilted vegetables, and fishmongers are struggling
to keep their morning catches fresh.
</P>
<P>
   Rickshaw pullers are demanding extra fares. Taxi drivers are
sacrificing a third of their paltry $4-a-day salaries, refusing to
drive in the heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if I lose 50 rupees a day. I have to save my
health,'' said Shymal Maitra, a 28-year-old cab driver, who took
the entire afternoon off after spending several hours behind a
blazing metal dashboard of a 30-year-old Ambassador sedan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels as though someone is burning you alive,'' said
Maitra, pointing to the blisters on his neck and arm.
</P>
<P>
   When the lights turn red and the traffic piles up at Calcutta's
busy intersections, drivers dart out of their cars and pour gallons
of water into their parched radiators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Calcutta is hot enough already thanks to the traffic and
pollution. The heat makes it intolerable,'' Maitra said.
</P>
<P>
   Most cars here are not air-conditioned. Neither are the houses
or shops or banks or offices or restaurants, for that matter. There
is absolutely no relief from the heat.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, several areas of the city were without
power Tuesday. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation blamed the power
shortages on heat-related transformer trouble and said it could not
guarantee uninterrupted service for the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   As ceiling fans came to a standstill, office buildings and
houses became veritable furnaces. Police now fear violence
especially if frustrated and very hot Calcuttans are denied live
television coverage of World Cup soccer matches.
</P>
<P>
   One local meteorological office offered hope and predicted the
monsoons, still 700 kilometers away from the city, would arrived in
two to three days.
</P>
<P>
   Other scientists say Calcuttans must wait until the end of the
month.
</P>
<P>
   A fluke storm teased for an hour Wednesday afternoon as the
skies turned gray and a cool wind whirled through the city. It
looked as though Gita Bashak's prayers would be answered. Heavenly
drops of water fell from sky to earth, the dusty ground soaking
them up like a sponge.
</P>
<P>
   All over town, people flew out of their houses and into the
streets to taste manna from heaven. Could it be, they wondered,
that the forecasters were wrong and ``barshakal'' (the rainy
season) had finally arrived?
</P>
<P>
   ``I opened every window in the house, and stuck my head out to
feel the water,'' said Bashak.
</P>
<P>
   But it was, as Bashak said, ``too good to be true.''
</P>
<P>
   One hour later, the clouds had vanished and the raging heat had
returned.
</P>
<P>
   And the monsoons seemed a continent away.
</P>
<P>
   Moni Basu, editorial desk chief of The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, is currently visiting her native India.

NATO CLOSE TO DECISION ON WHETHER TO USE AIR POWER IN KOSOVO
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELIZABETH NEUFFER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS _ The 16-member NATO alliance is seriously considering
the use of air power against Serbia to slow the escalating ethnic
violence in the province of Kosovo, according to senior NATO
diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   NATO defense ministers gathering here Thursday will examine a
range of options, including deployment of troops along the
Kosovo-Albanian border. But according to the NATO diplomats, the
ministers are more likely to order military commanders to start
planning for air strikes to stop the Serbian crackdown against
Albanian insurgents that has sent thousands fleeing from their
homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a new sense of urgency, and the focus of the debate
is on air strikes,'' a senior NATO diplomat said as Kosovo
Albanians gathered Wednesday outside NATO headquarters in Brussels,
waving flags and calling for NATO intervention.
</P>
<P>
   NATO is still far from ordering air strikes. Many members of the
alliance, such as Greece, are uneasy about such force against
Serbia. The United Nations Security Council would have to approve
it, and Russia has said it opposes such action.
</P>
<P>
   But air strikes are becoming a popular option as the West grows
frustrated at the offensive launched by the Serb leader, Slobodan
Milosevic, titular president of the Yugsolav Federation. Almost 300
people have been killed in the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Tony Blair, the British prime minister, told
Parliament that military action may be needed if diplomacy cannot
end the crisis. US Defense Secretary William S. Cohen, speaking in
Rome, said that force could not be ruled out.
</P>
<P>
   The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia
has also increased pressure against Serbia by launching an inquiry
to determine whether war crimes have been committed in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an armed conflict taking place there,'' Graham
Blewitt, a deputy prosecutor for the tribunal, said in an interview
in the Hague. ``We have an investigation under way that, in broad
parameters, will examine the ethnic cleansing and the crimes
against humanity occurring in this armed conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic launched a police action in the Serb-held Kosovo
province in February to break the back of the Kosovo Liberation
Army, the force fighting for independence.
</P>
<P>
   A second sweep last month by police and security forces, which
included heavy shelling, has left villages in ruins and has sent
nearly 12,000 Kosovo Albanians fleeing across the border to
Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations over the province's future have been fruitless.
Kosovo Albanians, 90 percent of the province's population, have
long argued for autonomy from Serbia. But Milosevic has refused to
cede the province, which some consider the sacred heartland of the
Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   While Milosevic and his forces clearly launched the brutal
offensive, the Kosovo Liberation Army is also an armed force that
has killed Serbs. And Milosevic has argued that NATO has no right
to intervene in what he calls an internal dispute.
</P>
<P>
   NATO will hold training missions soon in Albania, a member of
NATO's Partnership for Peace program. Six to eight ships are due to
visit the Albanian port of Durress and carry out military
exercises.
</P>
<P>
   One option before defense ministers today is to increase the
visibility of such exercises to send a warning to Milosevic.
Another is to deploy troops along the mountainous Kosovo-Albania
border. A third includes air strikes, which proved effective in
changing the war in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   NATO diplomats increasingly see air power as the fastest way to
avoid further escalation in the conflict. ``The greatest interest
is in the use of air power,'' a senior NATO diplomat said. ``People
see preventative deployments as less relevant to the current
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO air strikes would not be limited to Kosovo, diplomats
warned. ``Once you cross the line, the whole country is eligible,''
a senior diplomat said of Serbia.

 &HT;    Jury awards deceased man's family nearly $1 million
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ The courtroom wars over tobacco heated up
Wednesday when a jury ordered Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp. to
pay nearly $1 million to the family of a dead smoker.
</P>
<P>
   It is the largest cash verdict against a tobacco company, and
only the third courtroom loss for the industry. The award includes
$450,000 in punitive damages, another milestone that bodes ill for
cigarette companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's stunning because it's the first punitive verdict
against the tobacco companies,'' said attorney Norwood Wilner, who
represented the family of Roland Maddox.
</P>
<P>
   News of the verdict sent Brown &AMP; Williamson's stock price
plunging and other tobacco company stocks also fell.
</P>
<P>
   It is Wilner's second victory over Brown &AMP; Williamson. In 1996,
he won a $750,000 judgment for Grady Carter, a lifelong smoker.
That verdict is under appeal. Wilner has lost two cases against
R.J. Reynolds, and has dozens of other tobacco cases lined up for
trial, including three scheduled to begin in October.
</P>
<P>
   John Nyhan, an attorney for Brown &AMP; Williamson, the nation's
third-largest tobacco company, said the Louisville, Ky.-based firm
would appeal the Maddox verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very disappointed,'' he said. ``The jurors didn't
recognize Mr. Maddox's responsibility for the personal choices he
made.

 &HT;    No Viagra without heart check?
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Cardiologists say it is imperative for men who have
heart disease, high blood pressure or circulatory problems to check
with their doctors and undergo a complete physical exam, including
a stress test, before taking the impotence drug Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not letting any patients with serious heart disease take
Viagra,'' said Dr. Barry Silverman, an Atlanta cardiologist.
</P>
<P>
   The same circulatory problems that often lead to impotence also
stress the heart and possibly put these patients at higher risk for
sudden cardiac arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors are watching for possible adverse drug interactions with
Viagra, although organic nitrate heart medications are the only
drugs known to pose a problem. Some men who have died after taking
Viagra were on nonnitrate medications or blood pressure-lowering
drugs. But most of the men were older than 60, and several had weak
hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Mixing Viagra and organic nitrates, which include the common
heart medication nitroglycerin, can result in heart failure or a
large, sudden drop in blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Of 16 men who reportedly died after taking Viagra, four are
known to have taken nitroglycerin. Several others were on
nonnitrate medications, including hypertension drugs such as
Hytrin, Tenormin, captopril and atenolol.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration, which approved Viagra in
March, maintains that it is safe ``for its intended population.''
The FDA also said it cannot absolutely determine whether Viagra was
a factor in the 16 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   But FDA spokeswoman Susan Cruzan did not say whether the agency
has completely ruled out other possible adverse drug interactions.
``As with any drug, we will continue to monitor reports,'' Cruzan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer, the drug's manufacturer, said it has no plans to revise
the drug label and its warnings.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gordon Azar Jr., a Dunwoody cardiologist, said he isn't
worried about possible interactions between Viagra and blood
pressure-lowering drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Silverman said he lets patients on hypertension drugs such as
ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers take Viagra as long as
they don't have serious heart disease. And those taking nitrates
are absolutely banned from taking Viagra, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Barry Mangel, a Marietta cardiologist, won't prescribe the
impotence drug for patients who aren't on nitrates but might need
nitrate therapy soon.
</P>
<P>
   Viagra has had at least one major beneficial side effect _ the
demand for it has gotten men into their doctors' offices for
check-ups.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a boom for cardiologists, especially cardiologists
seeing African-American men,'' said Dr. Wayne Kong, chief executive
officer of the Association of Black Cardiologists. ``Many of the
men need stress tests to see if they can stand the additional
stress of sexual activity after a period of abstinence.''
</P>
<P>
   The flood of cardiology visits may provide early diagnoses of
high cholesterol or high blood pressure for some would-be Viagra
takers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They might need nitrate medication more than they need the
Viagra,'' Azar said.

SENATE JOINS `MARRIAGE PENALTY' TO ANTI-SMOKING LEGISLATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate on Wednesday wedded tax cuts to
anti-smoking legislation with the expectation that the unlikely
marriage will eventually break an impasse over the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers agreed to include a tax break for married couples who
earn under $50,000 a year, after Republicans narrowly beat back a
Democratic effort to kill the proposal by a vote of 50-48. The
amendment was then formally approved on a voice vote.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was sponsored by Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, who
argued that the tax cut was the only way conservatives could accept
the $1.10-a-pack cigarette price increases included in the overall
tobacco package.
</P>
<P>
   The tax cut will be paid for by a portion of the revenue raised
from the tobacco tax increase.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm said that because the cigarette levy would largely hit
lower and moderate income people, they should get some money back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will give a substantial tax cut to very Americans who are
bearing the burden of this increase in the price of cigarettes,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation has estimated that 73
percent of people hit by the cigarette price increase earn less
than $50,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
   The Gramm amendment would also allow self-employed individuals
to deduct the entire cost of health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats voiced concerns that the tax cut would drain money
from other public health needs they hope to fund from tobacco
revenues. But they conceded that the final legislation would have
to include some form of tax reduction to ensure Republican support.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, which badly wants tobacco legislation, also
signaled it could support some tax reduction for married couples.
</P>
<P>
   The Gramm plan would help married couples with annual incomes
under $50,000 by increasing their standard deduction over a 10-year
period.
</P>
<P>
   By the year 2008, those couples would end up paying an average
of $1,400 less annually in taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But to placate Democrats and moderate Republicans, the amendment
stipulated that only about one-third of the tobacco revenue could
be used to pay for the tax cuts. This would ensure that other
needs, such as state Medicaid, anti-drug and smoking cessation
programs could be accommodated.
</P>
<P>
   The Gramm amendment would cost $46 billion over 10 years. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Abolishing the so-called ``marriage penalty'' has long been a
goal of Republicans who say it is unfair that married couples often
pay more taxes than if they had filed as singles.
</P>
<P>
   However, lawmakers have had hard time finding the substantial
revenue needed to pay for such a tax cut. Furthermore, it is not
easy targeting who should get the tax break.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current tax code, about 42 percent of married couples
pay more taxes than if they had filed as single people, according
to a Congressional Budget Office analysis.
</P>
<P>
   However, about 51 percent of married couples, including many one
wage-earner households, received tax bonuses that more than offset
financial setbacks from being married, the study reported.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that the marriage penalty hits couples who both
earn relatively comparable incomes particularly hard.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats opposed to the Gramm plan said that in later years it
would cost so much that the government would have to dip into
surpluses to pay for the cuts. They said the surpluses should be
reserved to help shore up Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   They proposed giving tax relief only to couples that were
specifically penalized by their marriage status and not those who
incurred tax bonuses. That proposal was defeated, 55-43.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the criticism came from Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, was clearly annoyed that her
home-state colleague had taken the marriage penalty elimination
concept that she had proposed months ago and attached it to an
unrelated measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my bill,'' Hutchison emphatically noted during a speech
on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   But she said that by linking the tax cuts it to the tobacco
measure the Senate would be raising taxes on one group of people
and redistributing the money to another group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I think you have a terrible principle,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison voted for the Gramm amendment, calling it the ``lesser
of two evils.'' She said that if the money was not returned in tax
cuts it would be used for more government spending.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., who has opposed the tobacco bill,
said the tax reduction makes the measure ``a little more
palatable.''
</P>
<P>
   He conceded that a number of Senate Republicans will use the tax
measure as an excuse to vote for the overall bill.
</P>
<P>
   But the measure's fate in the House is less certain. Republican
leaders have said they are not planning to consider any legislation
as sweeping as the Senate bill.

A COCKTAIL FOR CANCER HAS CANADA IN A STIR
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Italy)   (dc) 
 By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ The visit this week of an 85-year-old doctor from
Italy who claims to have successfully treated thousands of cancer
patients with a cocktail of vitamins and hormones has set off a
debate within Canada's universal health care system about patients'
rights and alternative treatments.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of the Italian, Dr. Luigi Di Bella, on Sunday for a
week of meetings and appearances was reported on the front pages of
Toronto's daily newspapers and on television news reports.
Enthusiastic supporters have cheered him as he met with Canada's
top doctors in hopes of convincing them that his treatment should
be approved in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   So far he has failed. But that has not dissuaded his supporters,
many of them cancer patients like Suzy Mariotti of Toronto, who
wear buttons that proclaim, ``We Believe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are paying for my chemotherapy at Toronto General
Hospital and it doesn't work, so why don't they just give me the
money and let me try something else?'' Mrs. Mariotti, 58, said
outside the Ontario legislative building where Di Bella held a news
conference on Monday. She is suffering from ovarian cancer, and
chemotherapy has so far been only minimally successful.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other Canadians who support Di Bella, Mrs. Mariotti
wants the government to act quickly to approve the treatment, which
is used in parts of Italy. ``Canada has a good health system,'' she
said, ``but sometimes it's not enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Canada's universal health care system, patients receive
free treatment without having to rely on private insurance. But
alternative treatments are usually not covered, and they would be
costly to provide.
</P>
<P>
   A number of Canadians have gone to Italy for the Di Bella
treatment _ heavy doses of vitamins, the hormones melatonin and
somatostatin, and the drug bromocriptine, which have been used in
conventional cancer treatments. Some have reported spending as much
as $28,000 for the treatment. In March, four Canadian doctors went
to Italy to see if there was any basis for the claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``They failed to show us any objective evidence that this
treatment has efficacy,'' said Dr. Victor L. Fornasier, chief of
pathology at the Wellesly Central Site of St. Michael's Hospital in
Toronto, who led the delegation.
</P>
<P>
   Fornasier said Di Bella is a physiologist and biochemist who
conducted academic research and did not start a medical practice
until late in his career. When Di Bella opened his clinic,
Fornasier said, he apparently jumped from general theories to
clinical application without undergoing normal reviews.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian team found Di Bella's files to be incomplete.
Instead of X-rays and detailed diagnoses, they contained signed
affidavits from patients attesting that they had been cured. And
because as many as 60 percent of Di Bella's patients also received
conventional care, Fornasier said, it was impossible to determine
which treatment worked.
</P>
<P>
   The delegation recommended that the ministry of health await the
results of an ambitious Italian field study before making any
decisions. Allan Rock, the minister of health, has said he will
follow the recommendation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Fornasier conceded, though, that Di Bella's visit had focused
attention on the need for changes in the way doctors care for their
patients. ``People don't trust the health care system,'' he said.
``If there is no trust in the system, doctors are not going to have
the full trust of their patients, and that is when the patients
look for alternatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Di Bella has distanced himself from the coming Italian report.
He told reporters that he expected the results to be manipulated by
drug companies and others threatened by his success. ``I do not
need any more proof,'' he said through a translator. ``I have tens
of thousands of patients who feel well.''

FED CHIEF EXPECTS ASIAN ECONOMIC WOES WILL COOL US ECONOMY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan suggested
Wednesday that the Asian financial crisis would likely cool the
nation's ``torrid'' economic growth soon, freeing the Fed from
having to raise interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's testimony before a congressional panel was full of
hedges and contingencies, but investors took his words to mean that
the Fed does not see inflation as an immediate threat and does not
plan to raise interest rates in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average, which declined about 20 points
before Greenspan spoke late Wednesday morning, moved quickly into
positive territory soon after he was finished. But the market
closed down 78.22 points on concerns that Asia's economic slump is
causing US companies that do business there to report disappointing
earnings. Greenspan's comments, however, boosted the bond market to
its best showing in six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   As the nation's central banker, Greenspan is always on the watch
for signs of inflation, which can hurt economic propserity. Under
traditional theory, the economy would be expected to produce
inflation by now: Unemployment is at a 28-year low of 4.3 percent,
and the economy grew a rapid 4.8 percent in the first three months
of the year. Those conditions would normally force businesses to
raise wages and prices as they seek more workers to turn out more
goods.
</P>
<P>
   But Greenspan said the historic link between employment and
inflation may no longer apply.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is possible that we have, in a sense, moved beyond
history,'' he told Congress's Joint Economic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan said inflation has actually declined this year, and he
suggested the Asian crisis would keep US growth in check by
limiting Asia's appetite for American goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``The effects of the crisis in Asia will almost certainly damp
net exports further, potentially moderating the growth of domestic
production and hence employment,'' Greenspan said. But he also
warned that the Fed would raise rates if it saw signs of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is, get ready, because the economy is going to
slow one way or another in the second half of the year,'' said
Wayne Ayers, chief economist at BankBoston. ``Greenspan thinks it
will come via Asia. But if it doesn't, the Fed stands ready to
raise rates and make sure inflation is contained.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; if,,.2l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has left the overnight bank lending rate unchanged at
5.5 percent for more than a year. Changes in the overnight rate
often prompt lenders to raise or lower other interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony, Greenspan said the US economy had entered a
``virtuous circle'' in which low inflation convinces lenders to
keep interest rates low, which pushes up spending, factory
production and employment. ``The current economic performance, with
its combination of strong growth and low inflation, is as
impressive as any I have witnessed in my near half-century of daily
observation of the American economy,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   He also laid out the evidence that inflation and economic growth
would remain in check. Data on the number of hours that employees
work suggest that growth has likely slowed in the current quarter
from the first quarter, Greenspan said. Productivity is also
rising, meaning companies are able to do more work with the same
amount of labor and materials. When productivity rises, firms can
raise wages more easily without sparking inflation, economists say.
And firms have built up an ``unsustainable'' level of inventories,
Greenspan said. That build-up must slow at some point, ``perhaps
abruptly,'' which could help cool the economy.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, Greenspan said the most recent data
suggest that consumer prices have been rising at a faster pace in
the current quarter than earlier in the year. Most important, the
unemployment rate has fallen so low that businesses may have to
raise wages to retain workers, which could spark inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing he knows for sure: You can't sustain growth
where employment is growing twice as fast as the population,'' said
Alan Levenson, director of research at Aubrey G. Lanston, a New
York investment firm. ``He says that if you want to sustain the
expansion, you have to get job growth to slow before inflation
picks up.''

EL DUQUE BAFFLES BOTH FRIENDS AND FOE  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ The Yankees pay Mike Borzello to sit behind home
plate at every game with a radar gun and write down the speed and
type of every pitch thrown. In his own way, he's an expert on
pitching, but Borzello met his match Tuesday night. There were
times he had no idea what Orlando Hernandez was throwing.
</P>
<P>
   With his multiple arm angles and speeds and his variety of
pitches, Hernandez sometimes confused the scouts and catcher Joe
Girardi, and he confounded the Montreal Expos, allowing four hits
and striking out nine in an 11-1 victory. Dominating with his
guile, Hernandez all but clinched a permanent spot in the Yankees'
rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager, indicated Wednesday that a
final decision on his five starters was imminent, assuming
everybody remains healthy. Ramiro Mendoza will start Friday, in the
first game of the three-game series against Cleveland; David Cone
will start Saturday. David Wells, coming back from tendinitis in
his pitching shoulder, threw in the bullpen Wednesday and reported
some stiffness in his shoulder, but no pain, and he is scheduled to
pitch Sunday, in the series finale against the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez will make his next start Monday in Baltimore, followed
by Hideki Irabu on Tuesday and Andy Pettitte on Wednesday. By then,
Torre will most likely announce his decision, and the most obvious
solution is moving Mendoza to the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez will stay and continue to confuse opposing hitters,
who are batting .164 against him, as well as Borzello. Hernandez's
sleight of hand Tuesday night could be traced to the fact that he
threw his basic overhand curveball 70 to 72 mph, a slider about 80
mph _ and then dropped down and threw a breaking ball from the side
at 76 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would turn to a scout sitting next to me,'' Borzello said,
``and would ask, `Do you know what that pitch was?' And he would
say, `Your guess is as good as mine.'''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Widger, Montreal's catcher Tuesday, was hitless in three
at-bats  &QL; 
and, like the rest of his teammates, he didn't have a good swing or
even a clue as to what Hernandez might throw next.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was completely unpredictable,'' Widger said. ``One time,
the count was 2-0, and he dropped down to the side and threw me a
slider.''
</P>
<P>
   In the context of how pitchers usually pitch, throwing a sidearm
slider with a 2-0 count is like Michael Jordan shooting a
left-handed 3-pointer in the fourth quarter. ``Then,'' Widger said,
``he'll bust you inside with a fastball. With all of the angles he
throws from, you can't really focus on one release point.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Torre: ``We talk about a pitcher trying to find one release
point. This guy's got three or four of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the scout sitting near Borzello filed a report that
said Hernandez has six release points. Imagine Hernandez in front
of a clock: he throws with his arm angled at 11 o'clock, 10:30, 10,
9:30 and 9, and he also throws crossfire, with his body aimed in
one direction and his arm moving in another in a sidearm motion.
With two strikes, opposing batters have just 2 hits in 35 at-bats
against him, evidence that they cannot conceive what he will throw
next.
</P>
<P>
   ``He starts out with that violent leg kick,'' said the scout,
from an American League team, who did not want to be identified,
``and then you have no idea where the ball is coming from, what
direction, what pitch. And he throws everything for a strike. I
don't think he threw a bad pitch the whole night. Every pitch had a
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is to find a pattern in what he does, eliminate
possible pitches he'll throw in different situations. I couldn't
eliminate anything. I don't think you can guess the pitches. The
best thing to do might be to just look for something in one part of
the strike zone. He's like a Rembrandt, or a Barbra Streisand. The
guy is an artist. It was the best-pitched game I've seen this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Widger, Torre and the scout all dismissed the idea that
Hernandez thrived because he was facing the Expos, a struggling
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is, he made all of his pitches,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   Widger said, ``He would've been good against anybody.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A Yankees team doctor who examined Hernandez in spring training
believes the pitcher is the best-conditioned athlete he has ever
seen. His extraordinary flexibility is evident every time he goes
into his windup, and he draws his left leg up by his cheekbone. But
Hernandez said Wednesday that in the past, his leg kick _ which he
developed after watching Dwight Gooden pitch for the Mets on
television in 1988 _ was even more pronounced, even higher, so that
his knee would brush the side of his head.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how high he could kick his leg, Hernandez shrugged, stood
and, without any preparation or unusual effort, raised his right
foot above the locker, adjacent to Paul O'Neill's name plate on
top. Then, in one continuous motion, Hernandez did it again. No
problem.
</P>
<P>
   The lockers are six and a half feet tall. As tall as Darryl
Strawberry. ``That's incredible,'' said Strawberry, inspecting the
spot where Hernandez raised his leg. ``I wouldn't even try that.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale Sveum, an inch taller than the 6-foot-2-inch Hernandez,
drew his leg about halfway up the locker. ``No way,'' he said,
laughing.

   Jose Cardenal, the Yankees' first base coach, grew up in Cuba
and said that pitchers there are routinely taught to change speeds,
as Hernandez does, to vary their deliveries. The Texas-born Nolan
Ryan is the standard for youngsters in the United States, a power
pitcher who was clocked over 100 m.p.h. on radar guns. In Cuba,
players could emulate Luis Tiant, with his odd contortions and
change of speeds. ``In Cuba,'' Cardenal said, ``they worry about
getting the hitter out. They don't care how.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Cardenal ran into Tony Oliva, another Cuban-born
former star. He said Oliva told him that there was a pitcher in
Cuba who was better than all the rest, who could be a star in the
United States. El Duque, Oliva called him, referring to Hernandez
by his nickname.
</P>
<P>
   With Cardenal serving as interpreter, Hernandez said Wednesday
that he doesn't consider himself unusual, that he doesn't consider
himself a master of anything. ``I'm still trying to learn,''
Hernandez said. ``That's why I'm here.''
</P>
<P>
   It appears he will teach opposing hitters a thing or two along
the way.

IT'S SHOWTIME FOR SISTERS OF THE NBA 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By FRANK LITSKY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Women's National Basketball Association, a sister of the NBA
and a beneficiary of the NBA's marketing clout, begins its second
season with four games Thursday night. One of those games _ the New
York Liberty at the Cleveland Rockers _ will be televised
nationally by the Lifetime channel.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, 30 games in the 10-week regular season will be
televised nationally _ 10 each by NBC, ESPN and Lifetime. And those
networks, one or two at a time, will televise every playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   That extensive television coverage of the 10 teams (up from
eight) is part of the war between the WNBA and the equally young
American Basketball League for the public's heart and ultimately
its dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The ABL plays in the traditional winter-spring basketball
season. The WNBA plays in the summer, when NBA arenas have more
open dates. In their first seasons, the ABL had better players and
a higher level of competition, but fewer marketing dollars and
smaller crowds. The WNBA averaged 9,669 fans a game, to the ABL's
3,536.
</P>
<P>
   The WNBA scored a major signing coup this year. First, it picked
up Nikki McCray, the ABL's most valuable player last season. Then
it signed most of the best college seniors, including such
all-Americans as Ticha Penicheiro, the flashy point guard from Old
Dominion, Nykesha Sales of Connecticut and Kristin Folkl of
Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   Penicheiro will play for the Sacramento Monarchs. Sales and
Folkl are injured and will not play this season, but at least the
WNBA has them in the fold. Their presence has cheered such WNBA
players as Rebecca Lobo of the Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited,'' she said, ``because it's important to us to get
the best players, and we sure did this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The WNBA's biggest score may have been the signing of Malgorzata
(``call me Margo'') Dydek of Poland, who has played in Europe for
six years. When she reported to the WNBA's combine camp, she was
listed at 6 feet 6 inches. She turned out to be 7-2 and graceful,
with a 7-foot wing span that forces opponents to alter shots.
</P>
<P>
   The Utah Starzz made her the first choice in the draft, which
should get the team out of the cellar. But the Detroit Shock and
the Washington Mystics, the expansion teams, may not be buried
there, either. Washington, coached by Jim Lewis, formerly of George
Mason, has McCray. Detroit, coached by Nancy Lieberman-Cline, has
six foreign players.
</P>
<P>
   The ABL will start its season in November with 10 teams,
including new ones in Chicago and Nashville. Like the WNBA, it is a
single-entity league, which means the league owns all the teams and
signs all the players. Its season is longer than the WNBA's, its
salaries are higher and the players get part ownership of the
league.
</P>
<P>
   But the ABL does not allow its players to play in another
league. The WNBA does, and most of its players play overseas during
the traditional basketball months.
</P>
<P>
   The ABL is privately owned, and it lacks the financial clout of
the WNBA, whose 12 sponsors include Nike, Coca-Cola, McDonald's,
General Motors and American Express, and its national television
package pales next to the WNBA's.
</P>
<P>
   The ABL teams are mostly in middle-size cities. The WNBA teams
are in NBA cities, including New York, where the Liberty reached
last year's playoff championship game before losing to the Houston
Comets.
</P>
<P>
   While Val Ackerman, the WNBA president, did not call this a
make-or-break season, she said much was at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year is the test,'' she said, ``because the curiosity is
lessened and the novelty is gone.'' &QL;

NATIONS PLEDGE TO REDUCE DEMAND FOR DRUGS
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS.: H.A.F.M.O van Mierlo is cq.) 
(ja) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The General Assembly concluded a special
session on the world drug problem Wednesday with the 150
participating nations promising to work to reduce their appetites
for illegal drugs within the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   The effect was to place reduction of demand on par with
reduction of supply as an ``indispensable pillar'' in combating the
spread of illegal drugs. Until recently, the drug-fighting
strategies of the United States and many other consumer countries
focused on intercepting drugs from producing countries.
</P>
<P>
   The participants also shifted from a purely law enforcement
approach toward reducing drug supply to an approach of alternative
development, including inducing farmers who grow coca leaf and
opium to switch to less lucrative crops in return for roads,
hospitals, schools and other means to a better life.
</P>
<P>
   On the recommendation of the U.N. International Drug Control
Program, the delegates endorsed an ambitious proposal by its
director, Pino Arlacchi, to phase out cultivation of opium and coca
leaf in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The countries further agreed to do more to expose money
laundering, to tighten up on chemicals used to process illegal
drugs and to cooperate on extraditing traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not starting a new `war on drugs,''' Arlacchi told the
delegates. ``In fact, there never was one. Instead, the better
analogy for the international community is that of a doctor facing
a deadly disease. Drugs quite simply kill people. And it is our
responsibility to help find the cure.''
</P>
<P>
   The three-day session was filled with speeches that described
the damage done by drugs as well as calls for concerted action
against the traffickers. The session has been more useful in
bringing delegates together offstage to compare how their
respective countries deal with the problems and to discuss a
coordinated response.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Netherlands, which has the most liberal drug
policies, took the session into the uncharted waters of ``harm
reduction,'' a public health concept for reducing the harm that
drug users cause themselves and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our primary aim is to protect health and social well-being and
to reduce the harm and risks associated with drug abuse,'' the
Dutch deputy prime minister and foreign minister, H.A.F.M.O van
Mierlo, said. ``Within this context, we believe that drug users
should not be criminalized for their habits, but on the contrary,
should be provided the help they need.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch foreign minister said that his country tried to make
drug use less glamorous by bringing it into the open. ``For young
people in the Netherlands now, heroin is for losers,'' he said.
``Very few of them would think of trying it.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Mierlo asserted that such programs do not increase drug
abuse. ``On the contrary,'' he said, ``needle exchange programs,
for instance, have not led to more intravenous drug use, but they
have led to less people sharing needles.'' As a result, he said,
few Dutch addicts suffer from AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Some other speakers appeared unsympathetic. Wong Kan Seng, the
home affairs minister of Singapore, which hangs drug traffickers,
said that the situation is under control in his country because
``drug offenders are treated with the same gravity, regardless of
whether they are Singaporean or foreign nationals.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has been less than enthusiastic about
alternative development, in part because it would mean working with
some governments notorious for repressing their own people,
including Myanmar and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would love to be able to deal with advanced Western
democracies, but that's not where drugs are produced,'' Sandro
Tucci, a spokesman for the U.N. drug control program, said.  &QL;

3 MORE VICTIMS OF GRAIN ELEVATOR BLAST ARE FOUND

<P>
   WICHITA, Kan. _ For all the poetry of Kansas wheatfields swaying
in the breeze, the laborers who worked inside the big DeBruce Grain
elevator knew a job that could be brutish: dirty and low paying
work often done by Mexican immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   It was not an easy way to live. And for some, it was a violent
way to die.
</P>
<P>
   Fire and rescue crews Wednesday uncovered the remains of three
more victims inside the grain storage facility that exploded
Monday, bringing the death toll to five. Meanwhile, searchers
continued looking for one man still trapped in tunnels in the
wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the dimming chances of survival, officials Wednesday
expressed hope that the remaining worker might somehow still be
found alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is air in those tunnels,'' said Ken Cox, division chief
of the Sedgwick County Fire Department. ``So breathing would not be
a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The search was temporarily halted Wednesday afternoon when a
rescue worker slipped and was buried to his armpits in grain,
before being pulled to safety by other crew members.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies found Wednesday had not been identified. And
officials did not disclose the precise cause of death. Two victims
killed instantly on Monday were Jose Prajedes Ortiz, 24, and Jose
luis Duarte, 41. The others missing the explosion were Howard Goin,
Noel Najera, Victor Castaneda and Raymundo Diz-Vela. Six others
were seriously injured, including some who were badly burned.
</P>
<P>
   The DeBruce Grain elevator, one of the biggest, free-standing
storage facilities in the nation, has been cited at least twice in
the last 19 months by federal warehouse inspectors for excessive
grain-dust conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said that the company in both cases vowed to
clean up the dust, which can be flammable.
</P>
<P>
   The DeBruce facility, which towers over the flat prairie about
five miles south of Witchita, bears little resemblance to the
small, quaint wooden grain elevators found in so many farm towns of
the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it is a series of cement silos that stand 120-feet
tall, with tunnels that extend 800 feet, and has a storage capacity
of about 21 million bushels of grain. The DeBruce company buys
grain from farmers and smaller elevators, then ships it to mills.
</P>
<P>
   Grain is stored and extracted from the elevator by conveyor
belts that run the length of the facility. The huge giant silos,
which stand aside a freight rail line, had vast sections knocked
away, with some holes bigger than cars.
</P>
<P>
   The men inside the tunnels, which are 7 feet by 8 feet, were
working on the maintenance crew at the time of the explosion, a
series of jolts that shook homes 10 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Explosions in grain elevators are caused by the mixing of grain
dust and oxygen in closed quarters. The spark for the fire can come
from an electrical short, or the cutting of some metal. Rather than
a single blast, the explosion sets off a ripple of explosions.
</P>
<P>
   There have been 10 grain-dust explosions in Kansas in the last
10 years, but no deaths. Low-level jobs at grain elevators
typically pay $5 or $6 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Working inside the tunnels can be dirty, even disgusting,
according to people familiar with grain elevators, places filled
with strong odors and scrambling mice.
</P>
<P>
   Paul DeBruce, the chief executive of the Kansas City-based
company, said during a news conference on Tuesday that he had
invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in the facility, much of
it for equipment to contain grain dust. DeBruce purchased the grain
elevator in 1996 for $1.15 million.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 searchers were combing through the wreckage of the
elevator, including local fire crews and representatives from the
Federal Emergence Management Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the friends and families of the victims gathered at the
Oatville Elementary School, about a mile from the grain elevator,
where the Red Cross and other volunteers were helping them cope.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz, one of those who died, was recalled by family and friends
as a hard worker who loved life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always happy, always wanting to go dancing, to hold his
baby and be with his friends,'' said his widow, Claudia Ortiz.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz had moved to Kansas from Mexico about five years ago.
Known for his trademark black cowboy hat, Ortiz loved to sit
outside and talk with friends, as he held his 6-month-old baby,
Saul, on his lap.
</P>
<P>
   DeBruce said the workday Monday was proceeding as usual before
the blast. He said Goin was greasing bearings in the tunnel, while
the other three men were cleaning up spilled grain. The executive
said he had known Goin, who is in his 60s, since 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Goin had recently retired, but came back to help at the grain
elevator during the busy wheat harvest season.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they had detected no signs of life since some
thudding noises about 2 a.m. Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The division fire chief, Cox, said the spilled grain posed
hazards to the searchers, since it could swallow a person like
quicksand. But he said none of the workers, which included
firefighters from Oklahoma City, expressed any desire to be taken
off the dangerous assignment.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the families of the dead and missing have been told
about the work of the rescue crews.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're saying prayers for the rescuers, too,'' he said. &QL;

AGENTS SEIZE 1,300 POUNDS OF COCAINE HIDDEN IN PAPER ROLLS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ Customs agents seized more than 1,300 pounds of
cocaine after smugglers tried to bring it into the United States
secreted in specially made fiberglass barrels at the center of
tightly wound, one-ton rolls of brown wrapping paper.
</P>
<P>
   Four people have been arrested here so far for claiming and
dispersing the shipment, with an estimated street value of $40
million, said John Varrone, special agent in charge of the U.S.
Customs Service's Newark office. He said the cocaine arrived at
Port Newark by container ship from a paper mill in Santos, Brazil,
on June 1.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation is continuing, he said, adding that the
capital investment in machinery and the sophistication of the
elaborate ruse suggested that Colombian cartels like the Cali,
Medellin or North Valle factions were involved.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the seizure resulted from a program of
intensified inspections of cargo arriving at the port area, and
followed law enforcement monitoring of two previous deliveries of
rolled paper to the same individuals in the last six months.
</P>
<P>
   While not the largest seizure ever at the port, it is larger
than many of the more recent shipments traced to the big cartels,
said Anthony Senneca, head of the Newark office of the Drug
Enforcement Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, he said, it was common to have single shipments
of more than 5,000 pounds coming in from Mexico and elsewhere. But
that stopped with stronger border enforcement efforts. In recent
years, loads of 500 to 700 pounds have become more common.
</P>
<P>
   ``Different techniques are used by different groups,'' Senneca
said, ``but this is a fairly large seizure in this day and age.''
</P>
<P>
   The suspects, who were arrested and charged with intent to
distribute narcotics, were Paulo Portella, 33, of Manhattan; Jose
Mosquette, 49, of Bellville, N.J.,; Byron Alvarado, 33, of Corona,
Queens, and Robert Pacheco, 34, of the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Buono, an assistant U.S. attorney, said that the
suspects appeared before federal Magistrate Ronald Hedges Tuesday
and Wednesday and were being held pending a detention hearing on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   According to the complaint filed in Federal District Court here,
two suspects got $200,000 and another received $50,000 for
retrieving more than 500 green-plastic-wrapped, one-kilogram bricks
of cocaine from barrels hidden inside four rolls of paper among a
shipment of 40 rolls.

ALLY SHEEDY MAKES A BID TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., June 14)  
 (JT ) 
 By MARGY ROCHLIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, under a tent at the film festival in Cannes,
France, a moderator kicked off a news conference by briefly
introducing the American writer and director Lisa Cholodenko and
the cast of her movie ``High Art.'' Then, looking out into the
crowd, he said, ``Any questions?''
</P>
<P>
   Panel-weary, the standing-room-only tentful of French
journalists had shown up with very little to ask. It was almost a
relief when dark clouds drifted in off the blue waters of the Cote
d'Azur. The thumping of raindrops on the white plastic roof at
least broke the uncomfortable silence.
</P>
<P>
   To Americans there, this nonreaction was perplexing, considering
the fact that seated at the center of the royal-blue dais with her
hands neatly clasped in front of her was the 36-year-old Ally
Sheedy.
</P>
<P>
   To Americans, Ms. Sheedy is still the shining conscience of the
Brat Pack of the 1980s, the sprightly valentine at the center of
classic films about the transition to adulthood like ``The
Breakfast Club'' and ``St. Elmo's Fire,'' the touchstone for a
million awkward adolescences. She is the farthest thing imaginable
from a middle-aged lesbian drug-addict photographer, which is what
she plays in ``High Art.''
</P>
<P>
   Exhausted-looking and boyishly attired, Ms. Sheedy's character,
the faded legend Lucy Berliner, slumps her way through much of the
film knocking back tumblers of scotch, snorting heroin and making
love first to her equally strung-out girlfriend, a faded German
actress (Patricia Clarkson), then to a young, ambitious magazine
editor (Radha Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of the slumping is what is being widely regarded as
an accomplished portrayal of loss and artistic identity. At the
Sundance Film Festival, where ``High Art'' had its premiere in
January, even critics who were set to poke fun at Ms. Sheedy's walk
on the wild side left the movie making predictions of a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``The birth of Ally Sheedy as a real actress,'' read one notice,
perhaps best conveying how disconcerted film-world observers were
to find her so masterly at projecting torment and gravity. After
all, they had never seen her do anything in a movie much more
eyebrow-raising than eating a Captain Crunch cereal sandwich, as
she did in ``The Breakfast Club.'' And yet in Cannes, at the news
conference, it was just drip, drip, drip.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, on a hotel-front beach packed with so many topless
sunbathers that an ``Entertainment Tonight'' crew that wanted to
interview her had trouble lining up a PG-rated shot, a barefoot Ms.
Sheedy sprawled on an orange chaise lounge in a beige tank top and
laced black trousers. ``I was, like, squirming up there,'' she said
in a microreview of the strange event 24 hours earlier. Still, the
bewildered stares of the French reporters were preferable to the
flat, bored gazes that casting directors had fixed on her for the
last eight years or so.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been frustrating to the point of being just
devastating,'' said Ms. Sheedy, who since the early '90s has worked
steadily in straight-to-video movies and cable thrillers with words
like ``haunting'' in the title. ``I couldn't get arrested. I'd go
to an audition and it'd be like: `Surprise us. Shock us. Show us
something new. We already know what you can do. Now show us
something else. Prove yourself to us.'''
</P>
<P>
   On the path to proving herself, Ms. Sheedy bled from every
slight and rejection. But she never stopped trying, and old friends
regard that as vintage Sheedy behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even at her best moments, she was always extremely fragile,''
said Molly Ringwald, one of her ``Breakfast Club'' co-stars, who is
emerging from a professional dip that resembles Ms. Sheedy's
except, as Ms. Ringwald puts it, ``because of her personality,
Ally's probably more likely to remember the hard times.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a strength in her,'' Ms. Ringwald continued. ``You can
see it in her face. That mixture of strength and vulnerability is
one of the things that makes her an interesting actress.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In private, Ms. Sheedy spent a decade in solo classes with the
legendary acting coach Harold Guskin. In public, she recited
confessional poetry at open-mike nights, talking about the Ally No
One Knew: her abortion at 16, repeated bouts with bulimia and a
dependency on the sleeping pill Halcion so severe that a group of
friends led by Demi Moore confronted her and persuaded her to go to
Hazelden, the substance-abuse treatment center outside Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, she passed a sheaf of her verse to James Silberman, an
old friend who was then president of Summit Books. This resulted in
the release of her book ``Yesterday I Saw the Sun.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I was expecting,'' Ms. Sheedy recalled with
a wince. ``But I didn't think that people would be that dismissive
and condescending.'' She was mocked for the book far more
aggressively than for anything she ever did on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, she has spent more time in the warmth of the spotlight
than out in the cold. She grew up in New York, the eldest of three
children; her parents, who divorced in 1971, are Charlotte Sheedy,
a literary agent, and John Sheedy, an advertising executive.
</P>
<P>
   By the time she was 11, Alexandra Elizabeth Sheedy was a dancer
in pink tights and tutus at American Ballet Theater. By the time
she was 12, she had started a writing career that included a
well-received children's book, ``She Was Nice to Mice,'' and
freelance jobs for Ms. magazine and The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, after making good in the world of television
commercials, she jetted out to Los Angeles as a self-sustaining
teen-ager. Talent-spotters there found she had a luminous quality
that meshed perfectly with junior ruffians like Sean Penn (``Bad
Boys'') and with sweater boys like Matthew Broderick (``War
Games'').
</P>
<P>
   ``The best advice I've gotten is from books that people have
written who've taken the same path as me,'' Ms. Sheedy said back in
1986, when she was a touchingly earnest ingenue on a roll with no
idea that in a few years she would be banished from favor. ``Like,
Katharine Hepburn said that acting is nothing but waiting for a
custard pie in the face and that you should just learn your lines
and get on with it.''
</P>
<P>
   About one-third of the way through ``High Art,'' Ms. Sheedy's
character, who is being wooed back into the limelight by the
magazine editor, haltingly explains about the conflicting emotions
caused by public adulation. ``I loved the attention, but I couldn't
handle the impact,'' she says, her lips pulled into a pained smile.
``I sort of felt pigeonholed.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sheedy might as well have been reading from her own diary.
It's no wonder that after reading the ``High Art'' script, which
was slipped to her by an agent-friend early last year, she
impulsively picked up the telephone, called Ms. Cholodenko at home
in Manhattan and left a message on the answering machine. ``This is
me,'' she said, then pleaded to be given a tryout. That Ms.
Cholodenko's tastes in '80s-era cinema ran more toward
revival-house Fellini than mainstream American was something Ms.
Sheedy considered fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, I didn't know who she was,'' said Ms.
Cholodenko, who was making her first feature film after working as
an editor on movies like Gus Van Sant's ``To Die For.''
</P>
<P>
   She also didn't know that Ms. Sheedy had recently been dropped
by the William Morris agency and was representing herself. But in
signing the actress, Ms. Cholodenko soon realized that she had
gained the help of someone who would do anything for the team.
``What do you need?'' the director remembers Ms. Sheedy asking as
Ms. Cholodenko tentatively blocked out the first sex scene she had
ever directed. ``Do you want me to make out with her? Fine. Want me
to take off my shirt? Whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On that day,'' the director recalled, ``she was like our
anchor.''
</P>
<P>
   Team play aside, the role of Lucy Berliner _ by turns an
irritating presence and a deeply sympathetic one _ would appear to
have been an enormous individual challenge, but Ms. Sheedy says no.
``People keep asking me, `What did you do to prepare?' And the
answer is: nothing. I felt so close to the material that I figured
that the less that I did, the better.''
</P>
<P>
   Which also means that her emaciated look in ``High Art'' wasn't
the result of strict dieting. ``I am really skinny right now, and I
don't know why,'' said Ms. Sheedy, who knows that her weight is a
cause of concern among her friends. ``A lot of people have been on
my case about this for a long time _ my mother, my father,
everybody. I'm eating. I'm not doing anything anorexic. I'm highly
conscious of what that behavior is.''
</P>
<P>
   In Cannes, Ms. Sheedy was inundated with so many interview
requests from Americans that her schedule-conscious publicity
representative kept trudging across the sand, anxiously trying to
extricate his client and move her along to her next inquisitor.
Finally, Ms. Sheedy was told that an infotainment television crew
was waiting. ``I don't want to do `Access Hollywood' _ I've already
had access to Hollywood,'' she said with a laugh, suggesting in a
single quip much about lost naivete. ``I already know where they
live.''
</P>
<P>
   And she knows the rules Hollywood plays by. In exchange for a
second chance, those in the film industry will undoubtedly expect
Ms. Sheedy to draw a blank about her past and appear grateful to be
invited back to the party. Maybe Ms. Sheedy is, by nature,
forthright. Maybe it has been too long since reporters solicited
her thoughts. In any case, she comes off like someone who has
nothing left to lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually people don't talk because they're worried they're
going to cause themselves problems, right?'' reasoned Ms. Sheedy,
who has been quoted delivering sharply etched opinions about
everything from how Ms. Moore turned herself into an international
commodity to what it was like to be directed in a bed scene by Joel
Schumacher (``St. Elmo's Fire''). ``Well, I already have all the
problems. So I don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, how bitter and twisted up she sounds!'' added Ms. Sheedy,
as she spread a thin white film of sun block onto her reddening
cheeks. Then she laughed self-consciously, inhaled a final puff
from the smoldering stub of a cigarette and reluctantly navigated
her way back into the surreal hoopla of Cannes. In the words of
Lucy Berliner, Ms. Sheedy seemed to be loving the attention but
having trouble with the impact.

IBM ELBOWS ITS WAY INTO A GROWING SPECIALTY CHIPS MARKET
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Texas Instruments is getting some more
competition in the specialty computer chip business.
</P>
<P>
   IBM said Wednesday that it will spend more than $100 million on
efforts to get into faster-growing segments of the computer-chip
business, specifically targeting TI's favorite product, digital
signal processors.
</P>
<P>
   TI has bet the farm on digital signal processors, which are
special chips that translate light, sound and motion into the
digital language of computers.
</P>
<P>
   Such chips are used in cellular telephones, hearing aids, car
parts, computer modems and hard-disk drives.
</P>
<P>
   TI was never home alone in the DSP market, but the house is
starting to get a little crowded.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Lucent Technologies and Motorola said they will work
together to develop the next generation of digital signal
processors offered by their companies. The two companies said they
will share licenses on the DSPs and create a jointly owned designed
center in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, IBM, another player that can't be ignored, elbowed
its way into the room. Big Blue said it will spend $100 million on
custom chips that will work in cellular phones, digital cameras,
television set-top boxes and other consumer products.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will make it more competitive, but it validates the market
opportunity of DSP recognized by Texas Instruments,'' said Dave
Powers, an analyst for Edward Jones, a stock brokerage in St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   William O'Leary, an IBM spokesman, said IBM is designing two
dozen chip ``cores'' with pieces that will be interchangeable. Chip
cores are the building blocks of custom-chip making.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to making custom chips, IBM plans to offer some
basic chips, such as one modeled after a DSP chip line offered by
Texas Instruments. That chip is used in millions of cellular phones
and other communications devices.
</P>
<P>
   IBM said its chip will become the first alternative to the Texas
Instruments product.
</P>
<P>
   IBM's DSP chip will have the same powers, but it won't be a copy
of the TI chip, O'Leary said. ``IBM tends to be very
conservative,'' O'Leary said. ``From our perspective, it is a
totally clean IBM design from the ground up without any patent
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not an accident that chip makers are looking at DSPs for
salvation. The Semiconductor Industry Association recently rained
on the chip makers' sunny 1998 forecast.
</P>
<P>
   The industry had predicted a sales increase of 17 percent for
1998, but last week, the association said total chip sales will
fall 2 percent to $134.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, DSPs have been one of the strengths of the
semiconductor market. The association reported that DSP revenues
grew 39.2 percent in 1996 and 33.6 percent in 1997, and are
expected to increase 23 percent in 1998 to $3.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   And TI is the strongest player in that growing market. Forward
Concepts Co. of Tempe, Ariz., estimated that TI had 45 percent of
the worldwide DSP market in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   IBM's aggressive move onto TI's turf isn't stirring major
worries at TI's home offices in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, we have 15 years' experience in this market and we're
not resting on our laurels,'' said Donna Coletti, TI spokeswoman.
``We're not standing still. We have more than 1,000 third-party
producers who make tools that support our product.''
</P>
<P>
   Those tool makers are creating software that makes it easier to
use the TI chip in other products. They make software products that
handle basic functions such as detecting programming errors.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary said the IBM chip will be compatible with the software
tools that work with TI's chip. And Powers noted that TI has been
pouring money into its support of DSPs.
</P>
<P>
   IBM's push into DSPs is expected to force prices lower on some
chips. Coletti said TI's chips range from $3 to more than $100.
</P>
<P>
   Will Strauss, president of Forward Concepts, said the big users
of TI's chips in the cellular telephone business might use the
competition to get a better price, but there's no promise that TI
will lose those customers.
</P>
<P>
   Strauss noted that TI has held steady at its 45 percent market
share for the past four years as the demand for DSPs has grown.
</P>
<P>
   IBM is aiming at just part of TI's market for DSPs: the
communications sector. Strauss estimated that 25 percent to 30
percent of TI's semiconductor revenues come from the chip targeted
by IBM.
</P>
<P>
   Powers said he doesn't believe that the competition will change
TI's status in the market: ``We think they'll continue to be the
leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors weren't as confident that TI won't be affected. The
company's stock price fell 6 percent in active trading Wednesday,
closing at $51.50, down $3.38 a share.
</P>
<P>
   IBM shares fell $2 to close at $117.25.

SOUTHERN BAPTISTS URGE AMERICANS TO ELECT MORALLY PURE POLITICIANS 

</HEADLINE>

By RICHARD VARA 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Southern Baptists, in a not-so-subtle swipe at
President Clinton, urged Americans to send a message to elected
officials that ``character does count in public office.''
</P>
<P>
   Delegates to the annual meeting of the Southern Baptist
Convention voted for a resolution asking Americans ``to elect those
officials and candidates who, although imperfect, demonstrate
consistent honesty, moral purity and the highest character.''
</P>
<P>
   The 8,540 registered delegates also approved a resolution
affirming the ``finality, sufficiency and exclusivity of the
Christian gospel and of biblical revelation as the sole source of
saving truth.''
</P>
<P>
   The resolution implies the beliefs of the Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter-day Saints were not Christian. Salt Lake City is the
world headquarters of the Latter-day Saints, also known as Mormons.
The Rev. James G. Merritt, chairman of the convention's Executive
Committee, said in a sermon that the city was ``headquarters of a
counterfeit Christianity.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, a Southern Baptist, has been the subject of an intense
investigation by Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth Starr for a
cover-up of an alleged affair between the president and Monica
Lewinsky, a former White House intern. In the course of the
investigation, numerous allegations of Clinton sexual affairs have
surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   But the Southern Baptist delegates voted down an amendment that
would have named Clinton as public official involved in ``moral and
legal misconduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Whitehead, chairman of the convention's resolutions
committee, said the moral principle of the resolution, that
character counts in public life, would be blunted if it included
names.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are plenty of names on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue
to whom this resolution may be applicable,'' Whitehead said.
``There are plenty of people in city councils, county governments,
state governments in both Republican and Democratic and independent
parties to whom this resolution applies,'' Whitehead said.
</P>
<P>
   But that did not stop the Rev. Wiley Drake of California from
trying to name Clinton in the resolution. Drake said he was
disappointed with Clinton's moral record. He told delegates that
the resolution did not hold Clinton accountable.
</P>
<P>
   Whitehead, an attorney and a professor at Midwestern Baptist
Theological Seminary in Kansas, told a press conference that the
convention was countering the idea that character in public office
did not matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in the news media are saying that holding men and women
to a standard of basic honesty and fidelity to spouse is going to
screen too many politicians out of public life,'' Whitehead said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need good men and women in public office who know what good
means,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitehead acknowledged the resolution included Clinton and his
alleged indiscretions. ``He fits the category of this resolution,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also considered Clinton unrepentant since the president has
not publicly confessed or sought forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   It is not the first time the national convention has tangled
with the president. Clinton's support of gay rights and abortion
rights have upset the convention's conservative leadership. In
Houston in 1992, delegates attempted to oust the president's
Arkansas home church because of the stands. The effort was
defeated.
</P>
<P>
   Whitehead also defended the resolution implying that Mormons
were not authentic Christians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Southern Baptists are about the one true Gospel, the one true
Christ,'' Whitehead said. He denied that the resolution was
directed at Mormons but intended for those who do not believe in
Christ.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are eternal consequences to not knowing who Jesus Christ
is,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Merritt meanwhile attacked the Latter-days Saints in a sermon
Wednesday morning. ``Salt Lake City is both the mainstay of a
cultural conservatism for which I am grateful but is also the
headquarters of a counterfeit Christianity of which I am fearful,''
Merritt said.
</P>
<P>
   Merritt said there was a ``gulf of doctrinal and theological
differences which separate them completely from orthodox
Christianity.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Otterson, spokesman for the Latter-day Saints Church,
said the attacks were nothing new for the denomination. ``We have
heard it all before,'' Otterson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to get into a battle of theology or a
pingpong match on who is a Christian and who is not,'' Otterson
said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In other actions, the convention voiced continued support for
the yearlong boycott of the Walt Disney Co. In 1997, delegates
approved a boycott to protest what they considered immoral films
and literature produced by the entertainment conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still oppose moral filth and an agenda to promote
anti-family, anti-Christian values in all entertainment
industries,'' said the Rev. Tom Elliff, outgoing convention
president. The Rev. Paige Patterson is the new president.
</P>
<P>
   A convention publishing house, Broadman &AMP; Holman, issued a book
titled ``Send a Message to Mickey'' by Richard Land, president of
the Ethics &AMP; Religious Liberty Commission. Land is directing the
boycott for the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boycott is very positive and growing,'' Land said. Several
other groups, including the Assemblies of God, have joined the
effort, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Land said the boycott was succeeding in cutting Disney's
profits. But John Dreyer, spokesman for Disney, said the company
was recording record profits.
</P>
<P>
   Dreyer also said the company has rejected the convention's
proposal to establish an advisory committee of evangelical
Christians and conservative Roman Catholics to screen entertainment
material.
</P>
<P>
   The company is also rejecting a proposal to stop gay and lesbian
days at the Disney theme parks. ``The thing they are asking us to
do is to discriminate against the guests at our parks,'' Dreyer
said.
</P>
<P>
   The three-day annual meeting ends Thursday.

JURY AWARDS $450,000 TO FAMILY OF DEAD SMOKER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ky., Fla., Minn., Mass.)  (See also TOBACCO-MARRIAGE, TOBACCO-LOTT) 
(af) 
 By BARRY MEIER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a major defeat for cigarette makers that could affect the
course of federal tobacco legislation, a Florida jury Wednesday
found Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp. liable for a smoker's death
and ordered the company to pay about $1 million in compensatory and
punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the six-person jury in Jacksonville, Fla.,
marked one of the rare times in recent decades that jurors have
sided with individual smokers in cigarette-related lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   But the panel's decision Wednesday to award $450,000 in punitive
damages against Brown &AMP; Williamson could affect all cigarette
makers because several legal experts said that it appeared to mark
the first time that such damages had been awarded in a tobacco
case.
</P>
<P>
   An award of punitive damages, which are intended to punish a
defendant, had been made in 1995 against Lorillard Tobacco Co.,
which used asbestos in the filter of Kent cigarettes. But that
case, in which a smoker blamed his cancer on asbestos exposure, did
not pose a problem for other tobacco companies because Lorillard
was the principal user of asbestos in cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the industry's nightmare that in individual and, even
worse, class-action cases that juries will come down with punitive
damage awards,'' said Robert Rabin, a professor of law at Stanford
Univeristy who has followed tobacco litigation. ``It ups the ante
and creates great uncertainty with so many potential individual
cases out there.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Florida case, the jury also awarded $500,000 in
compensatory damages to the family of Roland Maddox, who died of
cancer last year at age 67 after smoking primarily Lucky Strike
cigarettes for 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   The jury found that Brown &AMP; Williamson, which acquired the Lucky
Strike when it bought American Tobacco Co., had produced a
defective product and then conspired to conceal its dangers from
the public.
</P>
<P>
   The punitive damages awared by the jury were far less than the
lawyers for the family of the plaintiff had sought.
</P>
<P>
   John Nyhan, a lawyer for Brown &AMP; Williamson, which is based in
Louisville, Ky., and is a subsidiary of BAT Industries PLC of
London, said that he expected that the company would seek to have
the award set aside and, failing that, appeal it.
</P>
<P>
   He said he believed that the judge in the case had mistakenly
allowed into evidence documents stolen from a company law firm in
1994 by Merrell Williams, a paralegal.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawyers involved in tobacco cases said that Wednesday's
decision may encourage those who believe Congress should not bar
class-action lawsuits and punitive damages in federal tobacco
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarette companies insisted on protection from such suits as
part of the $365.8 billion tobacco settlement proposal reached last
June between the industry and 41 state attorneys general. But while
that proposal has since collapsed, Congress is debating legislation
modeled on it, and some bills include protections from such
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Daynard, director of the Tobacco Products Liability
Project at Northeastern University School of Law, in Bostin, said
that many proponents of federal legislation had argued that bars on
lawsuits against tobacco companies were an acceptable trade-offs
for industry concessions because smokers has so little chance of
success in a courtroom. But Daynard said that Wednesday's decison
suggested otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   He added that many documents used in the Florida case had been
publicly released recently as the result of tobacco lawsuits
brought by states like Minnesota. Those records were now available
to lawyers on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone with a computer can download them,'' said Daynard, who
is involved in lawsuits against tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   Still, victories by individual smokers remain rare. Norwood
Wilner, a plaintiffs' lawyer in Jacksonville, who represented
Maddox's estate in Wednesday's case, also won a $750,000 verdict
against Brown &AMP; Williamson in 1996 that the company is appealing.
In the last two years, the lawyer has lost two cases brought by
individual smokers, both of them against the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
Co. a unit of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp.
</P>
<P>
   He has about 100 individual claims pending against cigarette
makers.
</P>
<P>
   Before Wilner's cases, only a few other smokers had succeeded
since the 1950s in their cases against tobacco companies. But some
of those verdicts had either been reversed on appeal or juries,
while they had found against the companies, had not awarded
damages. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the Florida case, Wilner had asked the jury to consider
meting out substantial punitive damages against Brown &AMP; Williamson
based on the company's net worth which he placed at $836 million.
But Stephanie Hartley, a lawyer who worked with Wilner on the case,
said that jury's award of $450,000 was far less that had been
sought.
</P>
<P>
   But she added, that Maddox's family who had carried his lawsuit
forward after his death, was not disappointed by the amount.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jurors indicated that they wanted to send a message and
they would have given out a much larger punitive damage award if
they knew the money was going for a purpose like education rather
than to individuals,'' Ms. Hartley said.
</P>
<P>
   In its defense, lawyers for Brown &AMP; Williamson had argued that
Maddox had been aware of the dangers of smoking but choose to
ignore them and not to quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are disappointed that the jurors did not find that Maddox
was personally responsible for the choices he made,'' Nyhan, the
company's lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hartley said she and Wilner had based their case in part on
previously-secret industry documents released in recent months as a
result of the lawsuit brought by the state of Minnesota against
tobacco producers. That lawsuit, which was filed to recover
tobacco-related Medicaid expenses was settled last month for $6.5
billion.
</P>
<P>
   She estimated that 25 percent of the company documents used in
the Maddox's lawsuit surfaced as a result of the Minnesota lawsuit.
But she added that the documents largely added details and context
to revelations contained in previously disclosed records including
those stolen in 1994 by Williams, the former paralegal, from a law
firm used by Brown &AMP; Williamson.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these documents out of Minnesota have helped us
tighten our case,'' she said.

CONTROLS ON SATELLITE EXPORT TO CHINA EASED IN '96, AUDITOR SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The controls on exports of satellites to China have
been loosened since the Clinton administration shifted authority
for the exports to the Commerce Department in 1996, a senior
government auditor said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the auditor, from the General Accounting Office, an
investigative arm of Congress, told a Senate panel that her agency
could not judge whether the less rigorous standards had jeopardized
national security.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not looked at how this process is working,'' said the
auditor, Katherine Schinasi, an associate GAO director for national
security and international affairs.
</P>
<P>
   But in giving senators an independent analysis, Ms. Schinasi
cited five broad changes since 1996 in government controls over the
exports of American satellites to be launched on Chinese rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Her testimony, which came at the first open hearing of the
Senate Intelligence Committee's inquiry into whether sensitive
satellite technology was illegally sent to China, struck at the
core of a broad congressional investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Whether China gained new information by launching American
satellites is important because the rockets Beijing uses to fire
its own satellites into orbit are very similar to the missiles used
to launch nuclear warheads.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and his top national security aides insist
that the shift in licensing authority to the Commerce Department,
which considers commercial interests, from the State Department,
which does not, had not relaxed export controls and had not
threatened American security.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new procedures that Ms. Schinasi outlined Wednesday,
Congress does not have to be notified of a new application for a
license, although lawmakers are alerted separately because a
presidential waiver is required for the export of any satellite to
China, and they are told of such waivers.
</P>
<P>
   Sanctions imposed against countries for violating missile
proliferation agreements do not always cover technology under the
Commerce Department's jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions do apply when the technology sales are supervised
by the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   Under the old rules, the Pentagon effectively had a veto over
satellite exports. Under new procedures, the Pentagon has one vote
among five federal agencies, and must persuade a majority to stop
an export. The new rules allow a three-step appeals process for an
agency opposing an export.
</P>
<P>
   Technical information is not as clearly controlled under the new
procedures, Ms. Schinasi said. Without clear guidelines, she said,
the Pentagon does not have an opportunity to consider sending
monitors to meetings between the satellite makers and Chinese
officials to insure that sensitive information is not inadvertently
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Additional controls placed on the satellites that were
transferred to the Commerce Department's jurisdiction in 1996 do
not apply to a group of satellites over which Commerce took
licensing control in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Ms. Schinasi said, many of the same controls the State
Department required are now available to the Commerce Department
``if it chooses to use them.'' But they are not required.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., the chairman of the committee, said
the shift represented a ``sea change in our technology-transfer
policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., who is the vice chairman, did not go
that far, but said, ``The process is not only complicated but lacks
a central leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelby also expressed his ``concern that the Justice Department
is still preventing information that is key to our oversight
investigation from being brought to this committee.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee and Attorney General Janet Reno are wrangling over
the release of reports by the Central Intelligence Agency, the
State Department and the Pentagon into whether two American
satellite companies disclosed sensitive information to the Chinese
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   As another part of the inquiry, Rep. Norman Dicks of Washington
was named Wednesday as the lead Democrat on a proposed House select
committee investigating the accusations about technology transfers
to China. The chairman is to be Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The House committee could have a budget of up to $2.5 million
for four months' work but Cox said in an interview that the
committee would not spend nearly that much. The full House is
expected to vote next week on setting up the committee. &QL;

SPREADING IMPACT OF GM STRIKE MAY QUICKLY GET WORSE

 By NICOLE CHRISTIAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ A strike by 3,400 workers at a General Motors Corp.
metal stamping factory has closed seven assembly plants from Kansas
to Canada and parts of three other plants, idling more than 18,000
workers by GM's count and quieting cash registers at nearly every
business in Flint, Mich., where the walkout began five days ago.
</P>
<P>
   But those problems are minuscule compared with what GM faces
Thursday night when 5,000 workers at a second parts-making factory
in Flint are expected to decide whether to strike over what they
call unmet job security demands. The plant builds an array of
components, including spark plugs and speedometers, that are used
in almost every GM vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Auto analysts said a strike there would ripple across North
America within days, quickly shutting most of the 22 assembly
plants not yet affected by the metal-stamping plant strike, causing
hundreds of temporary layoffs at independent parts supply companies
and depleting dealer inventories of cars and trucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be a long June for GM and its suppliers,'' said Mike
Robinet, managing director at CSM Forecasting in Farmington Hills,
Mich. Robinet's firm estimates that GM has already lost 14,038 cars
and trucks. ``The spark plug plant impacts production at almost
every GM plant,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As leaders of the United Auto Workers all but guaranteed the
second strike, economists said a combined work stoppage could trim
the nation's production of goods and services by $6 billion, on a
yearly basis, if a settlement is not reached before the end of the
month.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of this week, some economists say, the metal plant
strike alone will have reduced the nation's economic output by $500
million. The automotive industry represents 3 percent to 5 percent
of the nation's total economy.
</P>
<P>
   Workers on the picket line say GM exacerbated longstanding
tensions at the plant when it quietly removed several large
stamping dies from the factory over the Memorial Day weekend. The
machines press steel into parts for its 1999 GMC Sierra, an eagerly
awaited full-size pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   GM has not specified where the machines have been redeployed,
although they are believed to be at a plant in Mansfield, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   That tactic, along with what the strikers called GM's broken
promises on factory modernization, are partly why progress in
resolving the strike has stalled, some UAW leaders said Wednesday.
Dick Shoemaker, the union's vice president in charge of GM
negotiations, said, ``We have the right to expect that when GM
enters into an agreement, they will abide by that agreement.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   GM is the automotive industry's largest employer, with 224,000
workers, many of whom earn $45 an hour in wages and benefits. Last
year, the average GM worker earned $52,800 by working six- and
seven-day weeks.
</P>
<P>
   For GM, the costs of the Flint strike are rising almost by the
hour as one plant after another is closed.
</P>
<P>
   The metal-stamping plant strike has not yet prevented the
automaker from building the sport-utility vehicles and trucks that
account for most of its profits. But the strike has crippled
production of several profitable cars such as the Pontiac Grand
Prix and the Oldsmobile Intrigue.
</P>
<P>
   The closing of assembly plants in Linden, N.J., and Moraine,
Ohio, has halted the automaker's production of popular midsize
sport-utilities like the Chevrolet Blazer and GMC Jimmy. With GM
coming off a stellar sales month in May, when it increased market
share and lured back thousands of customers with rebates of $500 to
$1,000, the situation is even more critical because inventories are
already low.
</P>
<P>
   GM's stock price has fallen nearly 4 percent since the strike
began on Friday. Yesterday, GM shares declined 50 cents, to
$72.6875.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strike at the metal plant and tomorrow's threat couldn't
come at a worse time for GM,'' said Scott Merlis, an independent
auto analyst in Westport, Conn. ``In May, they made incredible
sales gains with some really competitive products. The lost
momentum during the strike will be more negative than any profit
impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Merlis said GM improved its market share to 32.5 percent, from
about 29.5 percent, since the start of the year. Some dealers said
Wednesday that they were alerting customers to the possibility of
shortages and delayed factory orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strikes make you thankful for the used car business,'' said
Dan Rudolph, owner of a Buick and GMC. dealership in Lewiston,
Idaho. Rudolph is currently waiting to receive 25 Buick cars and
GMC. trucks and sport-utility vehicles. ``If they don't get this
thing settled, who knows when I'll see those cars,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   People close to the negotiations at the metal factory said a
quick end to the strike was unlikely. The UAW contends that GM is
reneging on a $300 million pledge to modernize and is ignoring more
than 800 health and safety grievances. GM's response is that the
plant's productivity lags behind other stamping plants because of
union work rules that bar managers from shifting workers into jobs
outside their union classification.
</P>
<P>
   What makes GM so vulnerable to UAW strikes is its reliance on an
industry practice of delivering parts just in time for production,
rather than warehousing supplies as automakers did years ago. In
addition, automakers are now able to become more efficient by
producing parts at only a few factories, a trend that makes those
factories easy targets for the long union strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The UAW exploited that weakness in 1996 during a 17-day strike
at two brake plants in Dayton, Ohio. The strike caused GM to lay
off 177,775 workers and cost the company about $900 million after
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Within the UAW, the tactic of striking parts factories is viewed
as the fastest and most cost-effective way to war with automakers.
The union only has to pay $150 a week in benefits to thousands of
workers at just one or two factories _ a small price considering
the $725 million it now holds in its strike fund. Still, GM says it
wants to win more control over what happens inside its plants and
thus cannot afford to back down from battles with the UAW
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since Dayton,'' said Robinet of CSM Forecasting, ``we've
seen a new General Motors, one that is willing to make the hard
decision in order to gain the efficiencies many of its competitors
have.''
</P>
<P>
   But some experts argue that GM's. tough labor stance could
jeopardize long-term labor peace with the UAW. ``It's one thing to
go head-to-head with UAW once in a big way, but it's problematic to
have it become a recurring theme when every other automaker is
coming up with ways to work with labor,'' said Diane Swonk, an
economist with First Chicago NBD in Chicago.``Only GM knows what
the payoff is to their strategy.''

STAYING IN MANHATTAN: EXPENSIVE PROPOSITION 
</HEADLINE>
 (Duplication warning: Also moving in `t' category)

 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Looking for a hotel room in Manhattan? You have
plenty of options.
</P>
<P>
   You could book weeks in advance and pay $300 or so a night for a
room at a modern midtown high-rise like the Crowne Plaza. If you're
willing to pay a bit more _ say, $500 a night on average _ you
could probably get something with less of a hassle at the Four
Seasons or the Pierre. Or you could do what a growing number of
visitors are forced to do: stay in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel market in Manhattan, the most expensive in the nation
and fresh off a record year in 1997, continued to tighten in the
first quarter of 1998, with the average cost of a night's stay
creeping closer to $200.
</P>
<P>
   The market has become so expensive that in the past 18 months
five hotels _ the Lowell, the St. Regis and the Carlyle, as well as
the Pierre and the Four Seasons _ began charging an average rate of
$500. No other city in the nation has even a single hotel with an
average rate so high, industry experts said.
</P>
<P>
   And even as prices rise, it is still difficult to find a room in
New York unless it is booked far in advance. That fact has forced
some visitors to stay in New Jersey or bypass the city altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot find a decent hotel room anywhere on Manhattan, it
seems, for less than a fortune,'' said Alan Bennett of Sydney,
Australia, who was planning to come to the city in August. ``We
have searched data base after data base and rung hotel chains'
reservations centers, all to no avail.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It has got to the stage,'' he added, ``where we are about to
scrap our plans to go to New York and instead split our four or
five days there between an extra day or two in Washington and
Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who do find a room are often in for a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three hundred bucks!'' said Susan Jeans of Bayport, Minn., who
booked her room at the Crowne Plaza in mid-Manhattan two weeks in
advance. ``We were expecting like $200.''
</P>
<P>
   The average price of a room in Manhattan rose to $189.70 for the
first quarter of the year, according to preliminary figures from
the Coopers &AMP; Lybrand Lodging Research Network. That's a 13.9
percent leap over the $166.58 average room price for the first
quarter of 1997 and a smaller jump over the $187.91 rate for all of
1997. By the end of the year, Coopers &AMP; Lybrand expects average
room rates to rise another 10 to 12 percent, surpassing $200, a
figure reached briefly for the first time last fall and Christmas,
the busiest months of the year for many New York hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Occupancy rates are nearing records, too. For the first three
months of the year, which are among the slowest for the industry in
New York, hotels were 80.5 percent filled, according to Coopers &AMP;
Lybrand. That's an increase of 5.4 percent over the first quarter
of 1997, and only slightly down from 82 percent in the fourth
quarter of 1997, which was the highest since 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``Demand is unprecedented here,'' said Steven Pipes, general
manager of Le Parker Meridien, a hotel in mid-Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   John A. Fox, a senior vice president with PKF Consulting, a
hotel and real estate consulting firm in Manhattan, said that
business was good for a variety of reasons: the strong local and
national economies; a continuing shortage of rooms; the city's
improved image; a cheap dollar in many parts of the world, which
makes it affordable for foreign tourists to come to the city and
expensive for Americans to travel abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market has been on a steady upward climb since 1992,'' Fox
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jeffrey C. Zawadzk from Bayport, Minn., was hoping to stay at
the Millennium in mid-Manhattan this month, where a conference he
was attending was being held. He could not get a room, though.
Instead, he, like Ms. Jeans, a colleague, stayed at the Crowne
Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will do lot more planning next time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bjorn R. Hanson, chairman of Coopers &AMP; Lybrand's hotel and
casino division, said, ``It's a hotelier's dream, rates rising at
three to four times inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   The increased business has led not only to the planned
construction in Manhattan of more than 31 new hotels, with more
than 11,593 rooms, but also to a slight increase in hotel jobs.
According to the state Department of Labor, hotel employment in New
York City rose by 700 jobs to 36,200 in April of this year, from
35,500 last April.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the fastest growth spurt I've ever experienced in the
hotel industry,'' said Kevin Murphy, regional manager for New
Boston Select Staffing, which provides hotels with personnel. ``We
are filling job requests including housekeeping-cooks-wait staff,
and it's not just body-pushing anymore. Hotel skills are in great
demand. The hotel business is searching for skilled labor, similar
to the information technology industry. With the right experience
you can write your own ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanson also noted that hotels are curtailing discounts and
weekend packages because the markets are so strong. ``Everything is
priced premium,'' he said. ``And we are also finding that guests
are spending more money in the hotels.''
</P>
<P>
   The city's hotel space squeeze has sent many corporate travel
managers scrambling. J.P. Morgan &AMP; Company now often books people
into the relatively spartan Club Quarters hotel in downtown
Manhattan, which lacks amenities such as in-room faxes and room
service.
</P>
<P>
   And with the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau projecting
32.5 million out-of-towners coming to the city this year, including
5.9 million from abroad, many business travelers and tourists may
find that accommodations in New Jersey are their only affordable or
available alternative. But even there, the overflow from Manhattan
is making it difficult to find a room.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Eismeier, the treasurer of Colgate University, could
not get a room two weeks ago. ``We tried a dozen or more hotels,
plus an AAA Travel agent, plus the Williams Club,'' she said.
``Friends checked the Cornell Club and the Yale Club _ no soap.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, AAA suggested the Marriott at Newark Airport,'' she said.
``It was just fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made me want to see if any of our real estate investment
managers were investing in hotel development in New York City.
Seems like the city needs that.''
</P>
<P>
   The visitors bureau advises people trying to find a room to call
the Peak Season Hotel Hot Line at (800) 846-7666, which makes
reservations for more than 80 hotels in various price ranges and
can give availability information. If you're really stuck, the
bureau says, try contacting hotels after 6 p.m. to check on
canceled reservations that have not been guaranteed with a credit
card.
</P>
<P>
   Even with all the new hotels going up, it is probable, according
to industry analysts, that only 4,000 to 5,000 of the approximately
12,000 rooms that are planned will be built; there are currently
about 45,000 rooms in Manhattan.

however, that if the economy slips, demand could fall _ just as

YOUNG AND IN A NICHE THE MOVIES NEGLECT

   Wendy Wasserstein was surprised when a friend mentioned that she
had just accompanied 17 11-year-olds to see ``The Object of My
Affection'' for a birthday party. ``At first I was taken aback,''
says Ms. Wasserstein, who wrote the screenplay for that movie,
which is rated R and deals with bisexuality. ``But then I had to
admit that to appeal to such young girls made me really happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Many would kill for her recipe: Parents and producers alike are
struggling to get some better idea about how to appeal to the group
known in Hollywood these days as the ``tweens.'' They are the 9- to
12-year-olds, too old for the animated stuff and too young,
theoretically, for movies like ``Object,'' ``He Got Game,''
``Scream 2'' and ``Sliding Doors.'' Alas, those are the movies many
are seeing.
</P>
<P>
   These young people are walking contradictions, one foot still in
childhood, the other leaping into the age group just above. They
collect Beanie Babies when no one's looking and yet wear ``South
Park'' T-shirts. When I was my daughter's age, 10, I was heavily
into ``The Parent Trap.'' She had been there, done that by the time
she was 7. I doubt I'll be able to drag her to Disney's forthcoming
remake, but she has been counting the days until ``Can't Hardly
Wait,'' the high school party movie featuring actors from
television series she should be too young to watch.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood hasn't quite given up on the tweens, but it is as
perplexed about how to entertain them as parents are about how to
rear them. ``There's very little being made anymore for the
tweeners,'' says Terry Press, the marketing chief at Dreamworks.
``We figure they are either going to be dragged to `Quest for
Camelot' with their younger siblings or they reach 8 and want to
see `Titanic' and everything else. They've really become a niche
market.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the tweens may be the first niche generation, something
the makers of ``Spice World'' learned painfully a few months ago.
They expected their movie, starring the Spice Girls, to be swept to
success by the group's young fans. Instead, it was apparently done
in by them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call them subteens,'' says Barnaby Thompson, the producer of
the film, whose core audience was intended to be girls 7 to 12.
``What I think happens is they cancel out the teen-agers, who don't
want to go to anything younger kids want to see. So I think gearing
a film to them might be considered hazardous, since everyone wants
the teen-agers.''
</P>
<P>
   The only made-for-tween films that have done respectably this
year are ``Mouse Hunt'' and ``Paulie,'' both from Dreamworks. The
latter, about a talking, feeling and thinking parrot, has made more
than $20 million, luring skeptical parents with witty trailers.
``Mouse Hunt'' managed to survive the Christmas crush and has done
well on video. ``Children's films, to be honest, are seen mostly
now as a video market,'' says Ms. Press. The few other movies aimed
at the 9- to 12-year-olds, like ``The Borrowers,'' which critics
loved, came and went quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Now the summer movie season is upon us, and while in the past it
has been chock-full of films for the younger set, be it a Power
Ranger-Mortal Kombat feature or the latest Mara Wilson vehicle
(``Matilda,'' ``A Simple Wish''), summer '98 looks lean on tween.
There are ``Doctor Dolittle,'' a remake with Eddie Murphy in the
Rex Harrison role; ``Madeline,'' based on the Ludwig Bemelmans
picture books set in Paris, and ``Small Soldiers,'' which mixes
computer imagery with live action. And many youngsters are looking
forward to the July release of ``Baseketball,'' from the makers of
``South Park.'' But they may be sorely disappointed _ and their
parents sorely tested _ when they see the R rating.
</P>
<P>
   Even those savvy entertainment professionals who have tried to
gear films to this age group in the past have grown weary. ``When I
hear parents complain about no films for their young kids, it kind
of gets to me,'' says Roger Birnbaum, who has produced many a
tween-geared movie, including ``The Big Green,'' ``Rocket Man'' and
``Angels in the Outfield.'' ``Because when you make those kinds of
films, they don't take their kids to see them. At the same time,
the teen-age marketplace is really a strong demographic now, bigger
than the baby boomers, so everything is going toward them.''
</P>
<P>
   Birnbaum perfectly embodies how Hollywood is reacting to this
generation of tweens, lumping them in with the group they aspire to
and, in fact, will soon be part of. His newest film is ``Six Days,
Seven Nights,'' a romantic comedy with Harrison Ford and Anne
Heche. It's rated PG-13, and Birnbaum insists: ``It's good clean
fun for the whole family. There's nothing in it I wouldn't want my
11-year-old daughter to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Still there are elements in the film that someone somewhere
thought were more suitable for those older than 12. And so once
again parents will spend an inordinate amount of time squirming and
wanting to cover little eyes and ears.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's really not much that is age-appropriate for the
middle-school years,'' says Glenn Stein, a psychologist at the
Dalton School in New York. ``So these kids are going straight from
Disney to `As Good As It Gets.' And some kids can react adversely
to seeing things that are not designed for them. They can become
traumatized, desensitized and overstimulated. We need more `Star
Wars.'''
</P>
<P>
   Funny he should mention it. The hugely successful re-release of
George Lucas' trilogy last year proved, first, that if it's done
right, they will come. It also indicated that there might still be
curious, innocent tweens lurking behind all that precocious back
talk. In 1972, when he started working on the first film of the
three, Lucas was quoted as saying, `` `Star Wars' is for 10- and
12-year-olds who have lost something even more significant than the
teen-ager. Kids today don't have any fantasy life the way we had.''
The truth is, the 10- to 12-year-olds of 1972 would translate to
the 7- to 10-year-olds of today.

</P>
<P>
   The situation may be bleak, but it's not hopeless. ``Doctor
Dolittle,'' opening later this month, was directed by Betty Thomas,
who with ``The Brady Bunch Movie'' proved she had the right touch
to appeal to the tweens: don't take dead aim and never make them
look down or back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really made `The Brady Bunch' for people in their 30s and
40s who'd grown up with the TV series, so I was surprised when
young kids got into it,'' says Ms. Thomas. ``I didn't realize how
many had seen the old show on Nickelodeon.'' Ms. Thomas believes
that ``Doctor Dolittle'' will appeal to age 8 and up, but like
others in the tween-shy industry, she veers away from calling
anything a ``children's film.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a certain hipness to it, with Eddie Murphy as the star
and the animal voices played by Albert Brooks and Chris Rock, so
it's nowhere near a Disney,'' says Ms. Thomas, whose last movie,
``Private Parts,'' managed to make even Howard Stern something of a
family man. ``With my movies I never feel I'm talking to kids, but
to sophisticated human beings, and kids appreciate not being talked
down to.''
</P>
<P>
   Another film geared to this audience, albeit its younger end, is
``Madeline'' (think ``12 little girls in 2 straight lines''), which
opens in July. Spirited girls of summers past have not fared well _
witness ``The Little Princess,'' ``Harriet the Spy,'' ``Matilda,''
even ``Pocahontas'' _ but the folks behind ``Madeline'' say,
naturally, that this one is different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because these books have been read for 60 years and because
four generations of women have grown up with them, there is an
audience,'' says one of its producers, Stanley Jaffe. Jaffe shrugs
off warnings that girls today won't want to contemplate a girl
their age unless she's reading Seventeen and singing along with
Hanson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a very brief discussion about changing the story to the
present day,'' says Jaffe, ``but then we decided it was safer to
keep her in the 50s. It wouldn't be `Madeline' if the girls were
e-mailing each other. I'm not saying there won't be kids who will
think it's uncool to see this movie, but it's for people who
complain there's nothing for their kids to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Just for insurance, more adventure than is in the typical
picture book has been added _ a kidnapping, for example. And the
cast includes adult actors whom parents can appreciate (Frances
McDormand, Nigel Hawthorne).
</P>
<P>
   The road looks rough, but Jaffe recalls being warned not to make
a movie about divorce (``Kramer vs. Kramer'') or one in which
infidelity takes place in the first 10 minutes (``Fatal
Attraction''). ``And when we made `Bad News Bears,''' he says,
``everyone asked, who would go see it after 6 in the evening? It
turned out to be one of the top-10-grossing films that year. But
these are different times, and you can't go into it thinking you're
making a children's film. `Madeline' has to be accepted as a movie,
though of course it must respect the sensibilities of little
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Madeline, the redhead who strays from those two straight lines,
is nothing if not willing to question authority. This is good. Some
of the loudest roars of tween approval at screenings of ``Titanic''
come not when Rose and Jack, played by Kate Winslet and Leonardo
DiCaprio, finally connect romantically but when Rose makes a
well-known obscene gesture and when she tells her mother to shut
up. Ms. Wasserstein feels that is also a display of spirit that is
making ``The Object of My Affection'' attractive to girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``They seem to like that Jennifer Aniston's character is
independent and nonpassive, that she's still finding her own way,''
says Ms. Wasserstein. ``They also like that the grown-ups don't
have all the answers in the movie, at least all the right answers.
That's reassuring to kids.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, they are being exposed to openly gay
relationships, unfamiliar cultural references and complex family
issues. One only hopes they can pick up the good and ignore the
inappropriate. ``Some kids do have the ability to filter things
out,'' says Stein. ``They shut down when they can't handle
something.''
</P>
<P>
   That is no guarantee, however, that they're not being
overstimulated and overinformed way too soon. Every parent has his
or her own pet concern _ violence, sex, offensive language, warped
values. Many parents are willing to give in on something, usually
the language, since it's so omnipresent in daily life. The violence
can be numbing and, in light of the recent ``kids with guns''
real-life horror stories, disturbing. But as Stein points out,
``these kids are already getting it on television and in their
computer games, so it's hard to blame the movies alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is sex, which, at least in the PG-13 and R movies
that so many tweens are seeing, has become tantamount to a
good-night kiss. ``Basically, most of these PG-13 and R-rated
movies, including `Titanic,' have males and females jumping into
bed with each other right after meeting,'' says Mary Pipher, who
wrote the wildly popular book ``Reviving Ophelia,'' about
adolescent girls. ``And the combination of sex and violence is
pernicious. I think these kids are too young to understand the
consequences or the subtleties.''
</P>
<P>
   Never is the sex-violence equation more prevalent than in the
``Scream'' films, which an astounding number of tweens _ either
because of videotapes, older siblings or kowtowed parents _ have
seen. I plead guilty to caving in to pressure, and to my own
curiosity, and taking three 10-year-olds to see ``Scream 2'' (which
opened last winter but was put back in theaters recently, partly to
capitalize on the rapidly growing soon-to-be-teen-age audience).
Now there are at least three little girls who have suffered many
sleepless nights and months of refusing to use public bathroom
stalls.
</P>
<P>
   Wes Craven, the man behind these R-rated films, believes they
offer something for most age groups, even the impressionable
tweeners. The main character (portrayed by Neve Campbell) is yet
another of the nonpassive types considered healthy models for
mini-feminists. And, adds Craven, ``even the younger kids
understand some of the issues in the films, like whom can you
trust?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether we approve or not,'' he says, ``they are being pushed
into the information blizzard of adulthood, and at least with these
films they can have a laugh about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but who knows what lurks behind such nervous laughter?
Obviously every child is different: some 10-year-olds skew up, some
down. Some are thrust into situations without proper preparation.
My daughter's fourth-grade class came home with an assignment to
watch coverage of the Karla Faye Tucker execution and then write an
essay on the death penalty. The unconsulted parents were upset, to
put it mildly.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the VCR and the fact that other children's parents
may be less vigilant about what movies their sons and daughters
watch on videotape, especially when left with a baby sitter.
Currently making the tween slumber-party circuit: ``I Know What You
Did Last Summer,'' replete with sex, violence and college-age
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   What works best, suggests Pipher, is for parents not only to
decide what their children see, but also to see it themselves, so
they are able to have informed discussions later.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of parents are afraid to say no,'' says Stein, ``afraid
it will result in their children being left out of a group. They
have to be confident enough in their parenting skills, because
these discussions about what movie to see may seem minor now but in
a few years they will be pushing the envelope on more serious
issues, and the pattern will be set.''

STAYING IN MANHATTAN: EXPENSIVE PROPOSITION 
</HEADLINE>
 (Duplication warning: Also moving in `a' category) 
(dc) 
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Looking for a hotel room in Manhattan? You have
plenty of options.
</P>
<P>
   You could book weeks in advance and pay $300 or so a night for a
room at a modern midtown high-rise like the Crowne Plaza. If you're
willing to pay a bit more _ say, $500 a night on average _ you
could probably get something with less of a hassle at the Four
Seasons or the Pierre. Or you could do what a growing number of
visitors are forced to do: stay in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel market in Manhattan, the most expensive in the nation
and fresh off a record year in 1997, continued to tighten in the
first quarter of 1998, with the average cost of a night's stay
creeping closer to $200.
</P>
<P>
   The market has become so expensive that in the past 18 months
five hotels _ the Lowell, the St. Regis and the Carlyle, as well as
the Pierre and the Four Seasons _ began charging an average rate of
$500. No other city in the nation has even a single hotel with an
average rate so high, industry experts said.
</P>
<P>
   And even as prices rise, it is still difficult to find a room in
New York unless it is booked far in advance. That fact has forced
some visitors to stay in New Jersey or bypass the city altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot find a decent hotel room anywhere on Manhattan, it
seems, for less than a fortune,'' said Alan Bennett of Sydney,
Australia, who was planning to come to the city in August. ``We
have searched data base after data base and rung hotel chains'
reservations centers, all to no avail.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It has got to the stage,'' he added, ``where we are about to
scrap our plans to go to New York and instead split our four or
five days there between an extra day or two in Washington and
Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who do find a room are often in for a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three hundred bucks!'' said Susan Jeans of Bayport, Minn., who
booked her room at the Crowne Plaza in mid-Manhattan two weeks in
advance. ``We were expecting like $200.''
</P>
<P>
   The average price of a room in Manhattan rose to $189.70 for the
first quarter of the year, according to preliminary figures from
the Coopers &AMP; Lybrand Lodging Research Network. That's a 13.9
percent leap over the $166.58 average room price for the first
quarter of 1997 and a smaller jump over the $187.91 rate for all of
1997. By the end of the year, Coopers &AMP; Lybrand expects average
room rates to rise another 10 to 12 percent, surpassing $200, a
figure reached briefly for the first time last fall and Christmas,
the busiest months of the year for many New York hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Occupancy rates are nearing records, too. For the first three
months of the year, which are among the slowest for the industry in
New York, hotels were 80.5 percent filled, according to Coopers &AMP;
Lybrand. That's an increase of 5.4 percent over the first quarter
of 1997, and only slightly down from 82 percent in the fourth
quarter of 1997, which was the highest since 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``Demand is unprecedented here,'' said Steven Pipes, general
manager of Le Parker Meridien, a hotel in mid-Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   John A. Fox, a senior vice president with PKF Consulting, a
hotel and real estate consulting firm in Manhattan, said that
business was good for a variety of reasons: the strong local and
national economies; a continuing shortage of rooms; the city's
improved image; a cheap dollar in many parts of the world, which
makes it affordable for foreign tourists to come to the city and
expensive for Americans to travel abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market has been on a steady upward climb since 1992,'' Fox
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jeffrey C. Zawadzk from Bayport, Minn., was hoping to stay at
the Millennium in mid-Manhattan this month, where a conference he
was attending was being held. He could not get a room, though.
Instead, he, like Ms. Jeans, a colleague, stayed at the Crowne
Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will do lot more planning next time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bjorn R. Hanson, chairman of Coopers &AMP; Lybrand's hotel and
casino division, said, ``It's a hotelier's dream, rates rising at
three to four times inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   The increased business has led not only to the planned
construction in Manhattan of more than 31 new hotels, with more
than 11,593 rooms, but also to a slight increase in hotel jobs.
According to the state Department of Labor, hotel employment in New
York City rose by 700 jobs to 36,200 in April of this year, from
35,500 last April.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the fastest growth spurt I've ever experienced in the
hotel industry,'' said Kevin Murphy, regional manager for New
Boston Select Staffing, which provides hotels with personnel. ``We
are filling job requests including housekeeping-cooks-wait staff,
and it's not just body-pushing anymore. Hotel skills are in great
demand. The hotel business is searching for skilled labor, similar
to the information technology industry. With the right experience
you can write your own ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanson also noted that hotels are curtailing discounts and
weekend packages because the markets are so strong. ``Everything is
priced premium,'' he said. ``And we are also finding that guests
are spending more money in the hotels.''
</P>
<P>
   The city's hotel space squeeze has sent many corporate travel
managers scrambling. J.P. Morgan &AMP; Company now often books people
into the relatively spartan Club Quarters hotel in downtown
Manhattan, which lacks amenities such as in-room faxes and room
service.
</P>
<P>
   And with the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau projecting
32.5 million out-of-towners coming to the city this year, including
5.9 million from abroad, many business travelers and tourists may
find that accommodations in New Jersey are their only affordable or
available alternative. But even there, the overflow from Manhattan
is making it difficult to find a room.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Eismeier, the treasurer of Colgate University, could
not get a room two weeks ago. ``We tried a dozen or more hotels,
plus an AAA Travel agent, plus the Williams Club,'' she said.
``Friends checked the Cornell Club and the Yale Club _ no soap.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, AAA suggested the Marriott at Newark Airport,'' she said.
``It was just fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made me want to see if any of our real estate investment
managers were investing in hotel development in New York City.
Seems like the city needs that.''
</P>
<P>
   The visitors bureau advises people trying to find a room to call
the Peak Season Hotel Hot Line at (800) 846-7666, which makes
reservations for more than 80 hotels in various price ranges and
can give availability information. If you're really stuck, the
bureau says, try contacting hotels after 6 p.m. to check on
canceled reservations that have not been guaranteed with a credit
card.
</P>
<P>
   Even with all the new hotels going up, it is probable, according
to industry analysts, that only 4,000 to 5,000 of the approximately
12,000 rooms that are planned will be built; there are currently
about 45,000 rooms in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a drop in the bucket,'' said Fox of PKF Consulting.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Weinstein, editor in chief of Hotels magazine, noted,
however, that if the economy slips, demand could fall _ just as
additional rooms were being made available.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could be dangerous,'' he said.

SUPPORT GAINS FOR ENDING MARRIAGE TAX PENALTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also TOBACCO-MARRIAGE) 
(ja) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican efforts to cut taxes for some married
couples gained momentum Wednesday as many Democrats, including
President Clinton, expressed support for some version of the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-smoking legislation, the subject of desultory debate on the
Senate floor for several weeks, suddenly became the vehicle for
bipartisan efforts to address a longstanding quirk in the tax code.
Because of this quirk, some married couples with two incomes pay
higher taxes than they would if they filed separate tax returns as
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans led by Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas assailed the
``marriage penalty,'' saying it undermined the institution of the
family. Social conservatives have pressed Congress to promote
``family values'' by reducing the marriage penalty, and Speaker
Newt Gingrich promised conservatives last month that he would do
so.
</P>
<P>
   Under Gramm's proposal, married couples with adjusted gross
incomes of $50,000 a year or less could eventually receive a
special tax deductions of $3,300 a year, regardless of whether they
itemized such deductions as state taxes and mortgage interest. This
would reduce taxes by about $500 a year for a family with income of
$25,000.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say they have found a popular political issue in
their campaign against the marriage penalty, the very name of which
suggests injustice. And some Democrats agree.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm said that the tobacco bill, by raising cigarette prices,
would impose ``a bone-crushing tax on moderate-income Americans.''
Under his proposal, Gramm said, ``one-third of the money we are
collecting in higher tobacco taxes would be given back to working
families.''
</P>
<P>
   In its current form, he said, the tax code rewards many couples
who ``live in sin'' rather than getting married.
</P>
<P>
   The new tax deduction proposed by Gramm would be available to
married couples regardless of whether they had actually incurred
the marriage penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Though the fact is hardly mentioned on Capitol Hill, more
couples save money by filing joint returns than lose money. This is
especially true when one spouse has much higher earnings than the
other. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 25 million
such couples receive a ``marriage bonus,'' while 21 million incur a
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader,
denounced Gramm's proposal, saying it was too costly. Daschle
offered a Democratic alternative, intended to provide tax relief to
those who experience a marriage penalty, but not to those who
receive a tax bonus as a result of being married.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kent Conrad, a Democrat who is a former Tax Commissioner of
North Dakota, said: ``We ought to give those who actually
experience the marriage penalty the help they really need to
overcome it. It does not make sense to give the help to those who
benefit from being married in the same way you help those who are
being hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Toiv, a White House spokesman, said that reducing the
marriage penalty had not been ``a high priority for the
administration,'' but that President Clinton now supported efforts
to cut takes for some married couples as a way to secure passage of
anti-smoking legislation.

COPS SEIZE DUNKIN' DONUTS ROBBERY SUSPECT NAMED DUNCAN 
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK _ The homonym was not lost on the Police Department:
The man arrested Tuesday night in the robbery of eight Dunkin'
Donuts shops in Manhattan over the last two months was named
Douglas Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan was arrested as he and an accomplice tried to rob a
Dunkin' Donuts shop at 412 Third Ave. near 29th Street, said
Detective Mark Patterson, a police spokesman. As Duncan pulled out
a knife and announced a robbery, he was stopped by Officers Kevin
Buell and Teddy Lauterdorn of the 13th Precinct.
</P>
<P>
   Police took pains to point out that the arresting officers were
staking out the doughnut shop in the hopes of preventing a robbery,
not filling up on Boston Kremes.
</P>
<P>
   Eight Dunkin' Donuts shops have been robbed since April. In each
case, the description of the robber and of his method were the
same.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd come in, order a doughnut, and when the register was
opened he'd make a grab for the money,'' said Sgt. Randall Bush of
the Manhattan Robbery Squad. ``Sometimes, he'd show a knife.''
</P>
<P>
   So officers were given a sketch of the suspect and dispatched to
doughnut shops around Manhattan. ``Everybody was volunteering for
that job,'' another police official said jokingly, noting the
well-known affinity officers have for doughnuts. ``Guys said they
would come in on their days off for that one.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan, 24, and his accomplice were arrested at 5:10 p.m.
Wednesday and taken to the 13th Precinct, where they were placed in
line-ups before other angry doughnut makers. Duncan confessed to
robbing all eight donut shops, police said.
</P>
<P>
   He was arraigned Wednesday on charges of robbing the shop on
Third Avenue, but the investigation is continuing and he could face
additional charges, said Wayne Brison, a spokesman for Manhattan
District Attorney Robert Morgenthau.
</P>
<P>
   Police identified his accomplice as Howard Johnson, 43. They
said they did not believe that Johnson was responsible for any
other doughnut robberies. And they said there was no indication
that he had robbed any of his namesake restaurants.

CUTS POSSIBLE IN ONLINE PLAN FOR SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Mich., Ariz., S.C.)  (ja) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Facing intense bipartisan criticism on Capitol
Hill, William Kennard, chairman of the Federal Communications
Commission, offered Wednesday to scale back a plan to connect
schools and libraries to the Internet and said his agency would
make a final decision by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing before the Senate communications subcommittee
considering his agency's budget, Kennard proposed stretching the
initial spending on the project to cover 18 months, instead of the
planned 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We originally intended that the money we collected in the
first year would be dealt with all in a calendar period of Jan. 1
to Jan. 1,'' Kennard said.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 30,000 schools and libraries across the nation have
applied for a total of $2 billion under the program. About $625
million has been collected this year, most of it from big
long-distance phone companies. The commission and lawmakers are
concerned that financing all the applications from schools and
libraries could lead to higher long-distance rates. Opponents of
the program want to limit spending to the $625 million already
raised.
</P>
<P>
   People familiar with the negotiations between Congress and the
commission said that Kennard had started circulating a proposal to
give the program a maximum of $2.3 billion over 18 months, or about
$1.53 billion in 1998. Kennard was also weighing a plan to limit
the program to as little as $1.35 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The commission set a Friday deadline for a final decision on the
program's budget.
</P>
<P>
   Senators at the hearing said the program as wasteful and
ill-suited to connecting students to cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   The program, which emerged from the Telecommunications Act of
1996, was originally limited by the commission to an annual budget
of $2.25 billion.
</P>
<P>
   It has been clear since the winter that the program would not
receive the full amount. But until Wednesday, the commissioner had
not publicly discussed altering the timetable for distributing the
funds.
</P>
<P>
   Powerful members of Congress, however, want to go much farther
to rein in the program. The chairmen and ranking minority members
of both the House and Senate commerce committees, which oversee the
FCC, said in a letter last week that the commission should suspend
the collection of money for the program.
</P>
<P>
   Critics contend that the FCC exceeded its authority in
establishing a quasi-independent corporation to run the program and
say the commission ought to focus more closely on protecting the
subsidies that keep down phone rates in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was sent by Rep. Tom Bliley, R-Va., who is the
chairman of the House Commerce Committee; Rep. John Dingell,
D-Mich., who is the ranking minority member on the committee; Sen.
John McCain, R-Ariz., who is chairman of the Senate Commerce
Committee, and Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., the ranking minority
member on the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Speaker Newt Gingrich and Sen. Trent Lott, the
majority leader, have spoken out against the program and both
President Clinton and Vice President Gore have voiced support for
the program.  &QL;

GOP ATTACHES TO TOBACCO BILL RELIEF FOR ``MARRIAGE PENALTY''
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate, eyeing money to be raised by a
potential tobacco tax hike, on Wednesday approved an election-year
tax cut to address an oddity in the tax code called the marriage
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   About 42 percent of couples pay the so-called penalty, which
requires them to pay higher taxes than they would if they remained
single and earned the same income. The quirk has troubled lawmakers
for decades, but it is hard to fix without making other parts of
the tax code unfair.
</P>
<P>
   In a voice vote led by Republicans, the Senate attached the tax
relief plan to the sweeping tobacco bill now before Congress. The
prospects of that bill becoming law are uncertain, but some
senators said the tax measure will make it easier to move the
tobacco bill through the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stayin' alive,'' said Senator John McCain, a Republican from
Arizona, who is the key sponsor of the tobacco bill.
</P>
<P>
   The tax cut would give couples earning less than $50,000, and
who are in the 28 percent tax bracket, a tax cut of about $238 next
year. The cut would increase to more than $900 in 2008. It would be
funded in part by a $1.10 hike in the tax on each pack of
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the measure would allow self-employed individuals
to deduct the full cost of their health insurance from their income
taxes, effective immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Republican lawmakers have been pushing hard this year to end the
marriage penalty, a move that wins support from both the
tax-cutting and social conservative wings of the party.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats had been prepared to go along, and the White House
Wednesday endorsed an earlier version of the tax cut. But Senate
Democrats complained that the version finally approved cost more
than they had agreed to support. They argued that money for the
plan inevitably would come from the projected budget surplus that
the president has said should be held in reserve in case it is
needed to shore up Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is still conceivable, which is a problem, and it is why I
believe this will ultimately be scaled back,'' said Senator John F.
Kerry, referring to the size of the tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, a single man and single woman, each earning
$37,500, would each pay about $5,550 in taxes, a total of $11,100.
But if they married, their combined income would produce a $12,500
tax bill under current law _ $1,400 more than they would pay as
single people.
</P>
<P>
   Under the measure approved Wednesday, sponsored by Senator Phil
Gramm, Republican of Texas, married couples earning less than
$50,000 a year would qualify for a new tax deduction. Those couples
could deduct $825 from their adjusted gross income next year and
$990 annually in 2000 through 2002. The deduction slowly rises to
$3,300 a year by 2008.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats complained of the cost, $46 billion over 10 years.
Under terms of the measure, only one-third of the money would come
from the higher tobacco tax in most years. Democrats said the rest
would come from vital federal programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A vote for the Gramm amendment is a vote to take $90 billion
to $125 billion away from Social Security,'' Kerry said on the
Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry also said Gramm was giving a tax cut to all married
couples who earn under $50,000, even though roughly 50 percent of
those couples receive a ``marriage bonus,'' meaning their tax bill
is lower than it would be if they paid taxes as unmarried
individuals. Seven percent of couples neither pay a marriage
penalty nor get the bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Under a Democratic proposal, which would cost $27.8 billion over
10 years, couples earning up to $50,000 could take a 20 percent
deduction against the lower of their two incomes. The deduction
would phase out for those earning up to $60,000.
</P>
<P>
   The effect would be to lessen or eliminate the marriage penalty
for those who pay it, but make little change to the tax bill of
people who receive a bonus, Democrats said.

FBI BACKGROUND CHECKS MAY ADD GUN TAX TO TEXAS BUYERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ People seeking to buy guns in Texas may have to pay
a federal surcharge of about $15 beginning this fall unless state
leaders decide to help the FBI conduct computerized background
checks on would-be purchasers, a senior Justice Department official
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the state offers its assistance, the FBI will charge
licensed gun dealers $15 per transaction, the agency's
administrative cost of conducting the background check, once the
computer system is in place Nov. 30. The federal fee is expected to
be passed on to the gun purchaser.
</P>
<P>
   The fee is designed to encourage Texas and 30 other as-yet
uncooperative states to assist the FBI in its high-tech effort to
check criminal records of would-be purchasers, added the official,
who asked not to be identified by name.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno said Wednesday that state assistance
is critical to the national effort to keep guns away from
criminals. States have the most thorough, accurate and up-to-date
records on the criminal histories of their residents, she added.
</P>
<P>
   ``The states are an important partner in our efforts to build a
National Instant Check System,'' Reno said, referring to the FBI's
computer program. ``By working together in the coming months and
the coming years, state and federal law enforcement have a real
opportunity to keep guns out of the wrong hands and provide for
safer streets and safer communities.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI wants _ but the law does not require _ each state to
have a ``point of contact,'' a state official responsible for
assisting the federal agency in its effort to collect data on
prospective buyers, Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one knows more about state records than the states
themselves, and the system will work better if the states
participate in the National Instant Check System,'' the attorney
general said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the FBI's computerized system, prospective gun purchasers
would fill out a federal form seeking information about their
backgrounds. The consumer presumably would pay the FBI's fee to the
gun dealer, who would in turn access the computer system.
</P>
<P>
   The computerized background check would be completed within
minutes, and the dealer would be informed instantly whether the
sale may be made or if the check revealed information that needed
further examination. The FBI would then inform the gun dealer
within three days if the sale may be completed or if the purchaser
failed the background check, the Justice Department official said.
</P>
<P>
   The Brady law requires that firearms not be sold to indicted or
convicted felons, fugitives, illegal aliens or people who have
renounced their U.S. citizenship, been dishonorably discharged from
the military, have a record of domestic violence or been adjudged
mentally incompetent. People denied guns have a right to appeal
their rejection, but none of the more than 200,000 people rejected
under the 1993 Brady law have appealed, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   To preserve the would-be buyer's privacy, the computer will not
reveal why a prospective purchaser was rejected, the official
added.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said creating a computer system that will encompass more
than 60,000 gun dealers nationwide and account for the more than 11
million guns sold each year has presented a ``great challenge'' for
the Justice Department. ``But the prospect of making America's
streets and communities safer makes it all worthwhile and all the
more important,'' she added.

JOINT COMMITTEE AGREES ON EDUCATION TAX-BREAK BILL  
 (JT )
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., N.J.)   By LIZETTE ALVAREZ    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House and Senate negotiators agreed Wednesday on a
final bill to provide tax breaks to parents who save for elementary
and secondary school costs, including private school tuition, a
proposal that President Clinton has threatened to veto.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's centerpiece, tax breaks for education expenses,
remained unchanged in the compromise bill. The measure, which has
bipartisan support, was sponsored by Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga.,
and Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J. The agreement reached Wednesday
dropped two contentious provisions, including one that banned
voluntary national, standards-based educational testing, testing
that Clinton had proposed.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is expected to take up the measure next week, and
Torricelli said he believed that the Senate would have enough votes
to override a presidential veto. The House is also expected to take
up the legislation next week, but its prospects for a veto-proof
majority are uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Congress will soon produce a bill to improve the
educational opportunities available to children across our
nation,'' Coverdell said. ``I urge the president to abandon his
stubborn defense of failed education policies and join our effort
to implement real education reform.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill would allow family members, charitable groups or
private donors to contribute as much as $2,000 a year for each
elementary or secondary student to special savings accounts that
could be used for education-related expenses, including tutoring,
computers and private or parochial school tuition.
</P>
<P>
   The interest on the money and withdrawals from the account would
be tax free and could be used for college expenses. The accounts,
which would cost the federal government $1.6 billion in 10 years,
would be phased out for individuals who make more than $95,000 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said the bill favors the wealthy and does little for
the poor, arguing that the federal money would be better spent
elsewhere. Many Democrats have denounced the legislation as a first
step toward using federal money to subsidize private schools.
Republicans maintain that Clinton is merely responding to pressure
from teachers' unions, which oppose the measure.
</P>
<P>
   In negotiations, Republicans and Democrats on the conference
committee stripped two provisions from the legislation. Seven
Senate Democrats said they would drop their support for the bill if
the parts were not removed.
</P>
<P>
   One would have barred voluntary national standards-based testing
in reading and math for school children. Republican leaders said
that provision would now be included in the Labor, Health and Human
Services and Education appropriations bill. The other provision
would have converted nearly all federal education money into block
grants for participating states.
</P>
<P>
   By removing the two provisions, Republicans and some Democrats
hoped Clinton would embrace the idea of expanding the tax breaks,
which now exist for college students, and sign the bill into law.
Polls show that the proposal is popular with voters. The
negotiators also tacked on a reading bill, supported by Clinton,
that must be signed for $210 million to be spent starting July 1
for research, teacher training and grants to help improve reading
instruction.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have made the education savings bill their showcase
education initiative and have used it as an election-year issue to
tap into the frustration of some parents who believe that public
schools are not doing enough to teach their children. Some
Democrats also support the bill, saying it would help, not hurt
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is fairly deep Democratic support for this concept,''
Torricelli said, adding that the Republicans had ``made this easy
for President Clinton.''

hearts, Tatyana Denoshova's lament rings loud and often: ``It's
difficult to meet a real man here. Good men are already married and
if they are not already married, they are no good.'' In her case,
though, the desperation resonates with urgency. A 25-year-old
hospital nurse in this depressed Siberia city, Denoshova earns only
$40 a month and hasn't been paid since March. She says the men she
meets are similarly strapped, or sodden with vodka, or both. She

preferably American or European men who will love them and take

TOM DENT, 66, CIVIL-RIGHTS CAMPAIGNER AND POET
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN.: La., Ga., N.Y., Calif.)   (ja) 
 By ERIC PACE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tom Dent, a civil-rights campaigner who went on to become a
writer of prose and poetry, died on Saturday at a hospital in New
Orleans. He was 66 and lived in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   He had had heart surgery recently, said Joan Rhodes, a family
friend.
</P>
<P>
   Dent, a native of New Orleans, was a New York-based
public-information worker for the NAACP Legal Defense and
Educational Fund in the early 1960s. That job took him to places
that figured prominently in the civil-rights movement. He played a
part in James Meredith's entering the University of Mississippi in
Oxford as its first black student.
</P>
<P>
   From 1966 to 1970 he was an executive of the Free Southern
Theater, a troupe of actors that brought quality drama with racial
themes to economically depressed places in the South.
</P>
<P>
   In a performance one evening in 1966 in the Desire section of
New Orleans, for example, the company presented a reading of ``A
Poem for Mr. Lincoln'' by Dent. The work describes the experience
of a black youth who decides he will pattern his life after that of
the Great Emancipator but eventually learns that the racial
barriers on the road to the presidency are insurmountable.
</P>
<P>
   David Garrow, a civil-rights historian and a professor of legal
history at Emory University in Atlanta, said, ``Tom was someone who
both deeply appreciated the civil-rights movement's history and,
maybe as much as anyone, personified how the movement had a
cultural impact as well as a political one.''
</P>
<P>
   Dent returned to New Orleans, where he became one of the city's
leading literary figures. His writings included two volumes of
poetry, ``Magnolia Street'' (1976) and ``Blue Lights and River
Songs: Poems'' (1982).
</P>
<P>
   He spent the early 1990s writing poetry and essays and working
on a book, ``Southern Journey: My Return to the Civil Rights
Movement.''
</P>
<P>
   The book, which was published in 1996, is an account of a trip
that he took in 1991 to communities that had been in the news
during the civil-rights movement's tumultuous years. Reviewing it
in The New York Times Book Review, Lynn Karpen said, ``Mr. Dent
paints a bleak picture in which entrenched racism, seemingly little
altered by time, continues to hold sway.''
</P>
<P>
   Dent, whose full name was Thomas Covington Dent, was born to
Albert Dent, an educator, and Jessie Covington Dent, a concert
pianist. He received a bachelor's degree in 1952 from Morehouse
College in Atlanta and a master's degree in 1975 from Goddard
College.
</P>
<P>
   His writings also include a 1968 play, ``Ritual Murder,'' about
a killing done ``for no apparent reason.'' It is performed annually
in New Orleans. For several years, until 1990, he was the executive
director of the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Foundation. He also
taught at Southern colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
   His marriage to Roberta Yancy ended in divorce. He is survived
by his mother, of New Orleans, and two brothers, Walter, of
Washington, and Benjamin, of Camarillo, Calif.

FREER AND FRESHER, AN OLD FORM CATCHES FIRE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 14) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By VALERIE GLADSTONE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was not a dream. Late one night last month, at
Tunnel, a club in lower Manhattan, the deejay threw a curve. For
several hours a group of young men and women had been gyrating to
hip-hop, house and techno music when, out of the blue, a passionate
song sung by Alejandro Sanz filled the room.
</P>
<P>
   Without missing a beat, the dancers' posture changed. They
lifted their chests, placed their hands on their waists and
prepared for a fiery flamenco. Then, fingers clicking, hips
swiveling, feet pounding, they had a go at it. They sizzled. And
why not? Flamenco is hot.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year more performances of flamenco have been seen in
New York than ever before, at least twice the number of any other
foreign dance. Some 15 companies, both Spanish and American,
arrived in the city, among them the Cristina Hoyos troupe, Noche
Flamenca, the National Ballet of Spain and Ballet Hispanico.
</P>
<P>
   The tide shows no signs of abating. Early this month, the
flamenco star Joaquin Cortes returned to New York with his show
``Gipsy Passion,'' a huge hit in 1996 at Radio City Music Hall. Now
it's at the City Center. And starting on Tuesday, the Carlota
Santana Dance Company, with six musicians and nine dancers, comes
to the Joyce Theater for a week.
</P>
<P>
   The highlight of the program will be the New York premiere of
``Federico,'' a mix of dance and drama in tribute to the beloved
Spanish writer _ and champion of flamenco _ Federico Garcia Lorca,
a martyred revolutionary who died in the Spanish Civil War. This
year is the 100th anniversary of his birth.
</P>
<P>
   Why is flamenco suddenly so popular here? America's large
Hispanic population and an attendant interest in Hispanic culture
partly account for the phenomenon. But the dance's own evolution is
as much responsible for its new-found success.
</P>
<P>
   Originally a regional folk art, flamenco has found mass appeal
by incorporating new kinds of music and dance forms, from ballet to
jazz. At the same time, it has begun to modernize its look for
dance dramas. Though traditional costumes are still used, the
frilly shirts for men and the long, cumbersome trains on women's
dresses are nonetheless giving way to looser and sleeker
contemporary dress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flamenco has become more sophisticated,'' Ms. Santana said.
``After a quiet revolution that was long in the making, we're now
seeing it blossom.''
</P>
<P>
   Flamenco emerged from southern Spain at the end of the 15th
century, a time when Gypsies, Arabs, Jews and other outcasts
mingled in the region. These persecuted peoples poured their
emotions into a music and dance that became flamenco, distinguished
by a regal carriage of the head, torso and arms and a fierce
projection of pride and sensuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time,'' said Miguel Marin, a producer of Spanish
dance events in Spain and abroad, ``flamenco only appealed to a
small minority. Most Spaniards couldn't identify with it. But now
it has shed many of its dated accouterments without losing its
essence. If this hadn't happened, it might have become obsolete.''
</P>
<P>
   Flamenco artists of the 1920s were the first to look for ways to
make the dance more relevant to their times. The matchless Carmen
Amaya, whose career spanned 40 years, challenged sexual stereotypes
by donning pants and dancing with the power of a man.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, another master, Antonio Gades, took flamenco into the
realm of contemporary performing arts when he produced Garcia
Lorca's play ``Blood Wedding'' for the legitimate theater, a drama
filled with flamenco sequences.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, flamenco won international exposure when
Gades teamed up with the director Carlos Saura to adapt ``Blood
Wedding'' and another Garcia Lorca play, ``Carmen,'' for the
screen. Now dance film classics, the movies were the precursors of
Saura's eloquent documentary ``Flamenco,'' released last year.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout these decades the dance itself was changing. Elements
of ballet, modern and jazz dance were added to the flamenco
lexicon: arm movements became more fluid, and dancers would lunge
deeply and bend their knees. Like any folk art, flamenco had
historically been passed down from one generation to the next. But
now it became a subject of formal study, and performers began
improving their technique remarkably.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, no longer did every flamenco work revolve around love,
betrayal and death. The noted choreographer Mario Maya, for
instance, creates dances to Garcia Lorca's poetry, some of which
deals with nature and his native Andalusia.
</P>
<P>
   Flamenco music also changed. For centuries a guitar and singers
were all that was required for the dance. But in 1975 the guitarist
Paco de Lucia added jazzy percussion to his compositions. Today, no
musical accompaniment is out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the choreographer Maria Plages created a work for the
Compania Andaluza de Danza in Seville to the folk music of Tom
Waits, the world music of Peter Gabriel and the tango works of the
Argentine composer Astor Piazzola.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   This September, in the annual monthlong flamenco festival in
Seville, Spain, audiences will see how varied the dance form has
become, when 40 companies perform in the city's many theaters and
clubs. De Lucia, Ms. Pages, the singer Enrique Morente and the
composer and guitarist Manolo Sanlucar are among the major artists
on the roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flamenco has been freed from its strictures,'' said Marin.
``It can now be used simply as a movement language, like ballet.
Even though Antonio Canales adopts a purist approach and Joaquin
Cortes advocates a fusion, their base is the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Does fusion dilute the art? Some authorities on flamenco think
so. In an interview last year in the Spanish newspaper El Pais,
Canales stressed the difference between himself and Cortes.
</P>
<P>
   ``My kind of flamenco is intimate, austere and emotional,'' he
said. ``I defend flamenco at its purest. It is a great and profound
art. We're not talking about Coca-Cola Light here.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Santana falls between the two camps. She established her
troupe and school in New York 15 years ago, with a mission to make
flamenco more accessible to the wider public. One way she chooses
to do this is by presenting narrative dances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Federico'' was on her agenda for some time. Finally, in 1996,
partly because of flamenco's current high profile, the National
Dance Residency Project, sponsored by the Pew Charitable Trusts,
gave her $100,000 to produce it. The grant was followed shortly by
another one, from the New York State Council on the Arts, for
$10,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were impressed by Carlota's concept and the high quality of
her collaborators,'' said Susan Fait Meyers, director of the dance
project.
</P>
<P>
   For her choreographer and lead, Ms. Santana picked the elegant
young flamenco dancer Juan Andres Maya, a Gypsy from Granada. (In
its American premiere in Albuquerque, N.M., on June 9, Miguel Angel
Rojas played Garcia Lorca, as he will at the Joyce.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Santana also commissioned the well-known Spanish classical
composer Juan Campos to create the score and perform it with his
group, Canadu. She then asked Manuel Duque, professor emeritus of
theater arts at Pennsylvania State University, to write the book
and direct the production.
</P>
<P>
   He had directed another Santana piece, ``For Whom the Bell
Tolls,'' based on the Hemingway novel, in 1988. ``Each of us had a
different perspective on how to represent Garcia Lorca in dance,''
Ms. Santana said. ``It resulted in a very rich drama.''
</P>
<P>
   Tall and stately, perhaps in her early 50s, Ms. Santana looks
like the quintessential flamenco dancer, her hair black and
flowing. In ``Federico'' she plays the part of Garcia Lorca's
mother. The work compresses Garcia Lorca's brief life into a series
of vignettes, beginning with his childhood in Granada and
continuing through his early, heady professional success in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   With sensitivity, Duque shows how the writer's poems and plays
reflected both his inner conflict about his homosexuality _
something utterly taboo in Spanish society _ and his outward
political and cultural concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted the dance to be impressionistic, not literal,'' Duque
said. ``Many cultures fused in Garcia Lorca's work, as they do in
Andalusia. I bring in these influences.'' The drama ends with
Garcia Lorca's death at 36 in 1936, when he was shot by government
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   To give the story a contemporary feel, Maya used flamenco's
traditionally insistent hand claps and footwork in conjunction with
more natural movements, which lend the piece fluidity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I use tense and erratic gestures, others that are
soft and gentle _ all to convey Garcia Lorca's various mental
states,'' he said. ``Granada then had a closed society. I put his
sense of isolation into the dance.''
</P>
<P>
   When ``Federico'' had its world premiere in Granada last
December, cold winds had swept into the city from the surrounding,
snow-covered Sierra Nevada. Nonetheless, local dignitaries,
townspeople and visitors from Madrid and Barcelona turned out in
record numbers for the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was quite a test to open among his most devoted
followers,'' Ms. Santana said, ``but it felt right. Granada was
Garcia Lorca's home.'' In a rave review, Miguel Angel Gonzalez, the
local newspaper critic, called ``Federico'' ``a beautiful flamenco
musical.''
</P>
<P>
   The next test is the United States. ``I hope through works like
`Federico' to establish flamenco in the United States as a basic
dance language, comprehensible to a vast number of people,'' said
Ms. Santana. That ambition is a tall one. But if the Radio City
audiences and the Tunnel clubgoers are any indication, it may not
be out of reach.

CHILDRESS ROLLS DICE BY TRADING ACE MECHANICS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Richard Childress shook up the NASCAR world earlier this week,
when he ordered a swap of crew chiefs for his two underachieving
Winston Cup teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Underachieving'' hardly seems to fit when speaking about
seven-time series champion Dale Earnhardt and respected crew chief
Larry McReynolds. Between them, they have been involved in 94
Winston Cup victories. Their pairing at the beginning of the 1997
season widely was headlined as the key to Earnhardt's elusive and
record eighth Cup championship.
</P>
<P>
   But the union has produced more inquiries than victories 14
races into '98. So Childress has decided that Earnhardt will team
with Kevin Hamlin, formerly crew chief for teammate Mike Skinner.
McReynolds now is working with Skinner _ both swaps effective with
the Miller Lite 400 at Michigan Speedway this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the toughest decision I had to make in quite some
time,'' Childress said Tuesday, two days after he had informed the
principals. ``The drivers, everyone was ready for some type of
change. They were sitting here saying, `What are we going to do
next?' Everyone ended up buying in on it. It was a change that had
to be made.''
</P>
<P>
   Childress said he opted to trade his ace mechanics Saturday
night at Richmond, Va., where Earnhardt finished 21st after
qualifying an abysmal 38th.
</P>
<P>
   Skinner finished 30th at Richmond after qualifying an abysmal
34th. Skinner, who crashed heavily at Atlanta Motor Speedway in
March and Texas Motor Speedway in April, is 38th in Cup points.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt stands 12th in Cup points. Earnhardt never has
finished lower than 12th in the final standings during his career.
</P>
<P>
   McReynolds admittedly has had trouble adjusting from the Ford
Thunderbirds he worked on at Robert Yates Racing to RCR's Chevrolet
Monte Carlos. But he and Earnhardt seemingly had solved their
``communication problems'' during Speed Weeks at the Daytona
International Speedway in February. Earnhardt won his 125-mile
qualifying race and then removed 19 years of frustration by scoring
an emotional victory in the Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   The wheels of this working relationship, however, may have begun
falling off as early as April, when the Cup series visited Fort
Worth for the Texas 500. The open practice on Thursday, April 2,
was considerably spiced when Earnhardt got on his radio and ripped
the handling of his No. 3 GM Goodwrench Service Plus Chevy.
</P>
<P>
   In language that would have made A.J. Foyt blush, Earnhardt said
he could not drive the car. He asked for a second opinion, and a
third, and Sterling Marlin and Skinner both hot-lapped the No. 3.
</P>
<P>
   The rumor circulating the garage area then was that Earnhardt
had no confidence in the chassis _ a chassis engineered by
McReynolds.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt's results since crashing at TMS have been particularly
un-Intimidating, especially in qualifying. Earnhardt qualified
fourth at Daytona and second at Talladega, the series'
restrictor-plate races. But he has started no higher than 26th _ as
the best of the second-round qualifiers _ in the remainder of the
races. Earnhardt has posted only four top-10 finishes, including
Daytona.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Skinner _ the 1997 Cup rookie of the year _ has
managed only two top-10 starts and one top-10 finish in the No. 31
Lowe's Chevy. That was his memorable eighth-place run at Daytona,
where Skinner played a key role as drafting partner for Earnhardt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had the season we expected with either car,'' said
Childress, who has won 63 races and six Cup titles with Earnhardt.
``Winning the Daytona 500 was a real highlight. But as the season
progressed, it just wasn't working. We tried (changing) a whole
lot. We tried different bodies. We moved bodies backward and
forward and different setups. It was well-thought-out. We're not
pulling from the sky.''
</P>
<P>
   Childress said each of his crew chiefs has a different style. At
this point, maybe different really is better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin Hamlin is laid-back. Working with Dale, I think Kevin's
personality might fit better,'' Childress said. ``Mike Skinner is a
very aggressive driver. He needs someone to get ahold of him.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest risk with the swap, Childress said, involves its
on-the-fly timing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very unfair to Larry McReynolds and Kevin Hamlin, with
three days, to go out to another racetrack,'' Childress said.
``None of us are expecting miracles. We just hope to see an
improvement.'' &QL; 
THE BUZZ &QL; 
NASCAR &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup star Dale Jarrett has cooled his jets somewhat since
Saturday night, when he roundly criticized NASCAR officials for
throwing a red flag that factored into the outcome of the Pontiac
Excitement 400 at Richmond, Va. Jarrett was leading the race when
it was stopped with seven laps remaining to clean oil and debris
from Turn 2 after a multicar wreck. Terry Labonte, who was racing
with tires fresher than Jarrett's, was able to run down and bump
his way past on lap 398 of the 400 at the three-quarter-mile,
D-shaped oval. Labonte, ironically, won under caution after Johnny
Benson Jr. hit the wall between turns 1 and 2. Mike Helton,
NASCAR's vice president for competition, said Tuesday the red-flag
decision was made to give the fans the chance to see the race end
under the green flag. But Jarrett said the call was not consistent
with NASCAR policy. ``This sport has gone on for 50 years, and it
was our contention they clean the track up as normal,'' said
Jarrett, driver of the No. 88 Ford Quality Care/Ford Credit Taurus.
``What hurt us was stopping with older tires and them having the
opportunity to cool off. Where Terry and Rusty Wallace had much
newer tires. We thought it could be cleaned in three or four laps,
and we could race a couple under green. We're not against finishing
the race under green. That's what the fans deserve to see. But we
have to have some basis to go off of when we make our (pit)
decisions. This didn't seem to go along with the norm. Each
circumstance is different. I understand it was a call they had to
make in about 10 seconds, and it was best for the sport. We're not
happy the way things came out, but down the road the decision could
benefit us.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett also sought to defuse talk about possible retaliation
directed at Labonte during the Miller Lite 400 at Michigan Speedway
this weekend. Labonte used the right front fender of the No. 5
Kellogg's Chevrolet Monte Carlo to bump-pass past Jarrett.
Immediately after the race, Jarrett said, ``That's all right. We'll
remember that, and another day will come around.'' On Tuesday,
Jarrett modified his remarks. ``I'm not looking to rub on Terry
Labonte, at 190 mph or 200 going into the corners (at Michigan),''
Jarrett said. ``I'm not going to wreck Terry Labonte. That's not
the makeup of NASCAR. Hopefully one day I'll beat him; if I have to
use the bumper a little bit, then that's what I'll do. I know Terry
Labonte is a hard racer. He could have hit me a lot harder and put
me out of the race. He did enough to get by, and I finished second.
It shows the premium of winning Winston Cup races. When you're in
that position, you've got to take that chance. As far as paybacks _
the best way we can pay somebody back is to beat them on the
racetrack.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Irvan put the exclamation point on his comeback from a
near-fatal wreck at the Michigan Speedway in August 1994 last June,
when he won the Miller Lite 400 by 2.984 seconds over seven-time
Michigan winner Bill Elliott. Irvan said he has become a more
patient driver during his comeback. ``A lot of it is just more
experience,'' said Irvan, driver of the No. 36 Skittles Pontiac
Grand Prix. ``I guess when you hit your head so hard, sooner or
later you figure out how not to do it.'' ...

   The top six drivers in the Cup standings are separated by just
93 points through the first 13 races. That pack includes leader
Jeremy Mayfield (1,868 points), Rusty Wallace, Jeff Gordon, Mark
Martin, Jarrett and Terry Labonte (1,775). This is the first time
in NASCAR history that six drivers have been within 100 points of
the lead after the 13th race. &QL;

   If you are looking for someone in the Pep Boys Indy Racing
League to carry the ball once Tony Stewart heads off to a full-time
NASCAR ride next season, car owner A.J. Foyt offers his rising
star, Billy Boat. Winner of the True Value 500K at Texas Motor
Speedway on Saturday night, Boat has a catchy name, he is
approachable and quotable. And as Foyt pointed out, Boat has won
open-wheel races across the country. ``A lot of people know Billy
Boat,'' said Foyt, who believes the name recognition factor in the
rival Championship Auto Racing Teams FedEx Series is overstated.
``The names I know over there are Bobby Rahal, Bryan Herta _
because he drove for me _ and Little Al (Unser),'' Foyt said. ``You
got Michael Andretti. I know Jimmy Vasser, but the average person
don't know Vasser. And Alex Sardi (Zanardi)? Who really knows him?
You know him, I know him because he's racing. And that's really
about it over there. You've got a lot more names over here, I
think. And you're going to have bigger names over here.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Boat was one of six drivers who traded the lead 22 times during
the 312-mile night event at TMS. That was just one lead change
short of the IRL record, set during the Indy 500 _ a race which is
188 miles longer than the True Value 500K. ...
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Robby Unser has recorded top-10 finishes in both his IRL
starts. He was ninth at TMS in the Team Cheever Dallara/Aurora
owned by Indy 500 champion Eddie Cheever. Unser placed fifth in the
Indy 500 last month. &QL;

   Jac Haudenschild's Pennzoil World of Outlaws season became
painful on June 1, when he injured his shoulder in a wreck at
Lebanon Valley Speedway in West Lebanon, N.Y. He qualified for the

<P>
   Haudenschild since has missed two races in upstate New York and

FALWELL PROCLAIMS HIMSELF FULL-FLEDGED SOUTHERN BAPTIST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ The Rev. Jerry Falwell, who for the first time
is a voting delegate at the Southern Baptist Convention, now says
he is a full-fledged Southern Baptist. And he believes that his
adopted denomination is one of the most powerful political forces
in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Southern Baptists, with 15 million members strong, is a force
to be reckoned with,'' Falwell said in an interview at the
convention, which ends Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The high-profile leader of religious-political conservatives
predicted that the leadership of the giant denomination, which now
sides with social conservatives opposing abortion and gay
lifestyles, and championing prayer in schools, will have a major
influence in electing a Republican president in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it's George W. Bush, John Ashcroft (a Republican
senator from Missouri) or Steve Forbes, the Baptists will be a
force in getting them elected,'' Falwell predicted. ``And President
Clinton is making it easier for a Republican to win.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that he believes that Texas Gov. George W. Bush is the
leading prospect for the Republican presidential nomination at
present.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early to predict, but I think it's George W. Bush's
nomination to lose,'' Falwell said. ``He has a kind and gentle
quality and maybe even more charisma than his father,'' former
President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Falwell, pastor of the 11,000-member Thomas Road Baptist Church
in Lynchburg, Va., arrived at the Southern Baptist Convention on
Sunday with 10 voting messengers, or delegates, from his church.
But he has purposely kept a low profile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been to every session, but I always slipped out through
the back door,'' Falwell said. He said he didn't want to distract
from the convention's main business.
</P>
<P>
   But Falwell appeared on the ``Crossfire'' TV program Tuesday and
supported an amendment to the Baptist Faith and Message Statement
that said, in part, that wives are to ``submit graciously to the
servant leadership of their husbands.''
</P>
<P>
   The most significant part of the statement on the family,
Falwell said Wednesday, is that it rejected the legitimacy of gay
and lesbian marriages.
</P>
<P>
   Falwell burst onto the national scene in the 1980s as founder of
the now-defunct Moral Majority, one of the first organizations of
religious conservatives to emerge during the Reagan era to speak
out on moral and social issues. He said he and his church have
always been identified with the independent fundamentalist Baptist
movement, which was founded in the 1930s by the late Rev. J. Frank
Norris of Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   But he has moved steadily closer to the Southern Baptist
Convention as it has become more conservative. Now he says his
church is dually aligned with the Southern Baptist Convention and
the Bible Baptist Fellowship, an independent Baptist organization
based in Springfield, Mo., that grew out of the Norris movement.
</P>
<P>
   Falwell and his church became eligible to join the Southern
Baptist Convention last year when his congregation began donating
funds to the Southern Baptist Conservatives of Virginia, a group
that broke away from that state's convention controlled by
moderates.
</P>
<P>
   A major reason for coming to the Salt Lake City meeting, Falwell
said, was to vote for his close friend, Paige Patterson, as
convention president.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson, former president of Criswell College in Dallas and
now president of Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary, was
elected by acclamation Tuesday. He was a driving force when
conservatives won control of the denomination from moderates in the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now there is no reason at all for any Bible-believing
independent conservative Baptist church not to become a part of the
Southern Baptist Convention,'' Falwell said.
</P>
<P>
   He said his Thomas Road Baptist Church has helped start several
hundred congregations and that many of those churches now are
becoming part of the Southern Baptist Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all of those churches will be in the Southern Baptist
Convention eventually,'' he said. ``We had (representatives from)
25 or 30 of the churches at this convention.''

GM, CHRYSLER TO RETAIN AIRLINE FOR UNLIMITED EMPLOYEE TRAVEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In one of the first attempts by major companies to counter the
high air fares charged by the major airlines, Chrysler Corp. and
General Motors Corp. are near an agreement to pay a monthly fee for
five years to Pro Air, a start-up airline based in Detroit, in
exchange for unlimited passage on the carrier for their employees.
</P>
<P>
   The innovative deal will help Pro Air, which is not yet a year
old and flies to just half a dozen destinations, compete against
Northwest Airlines, by far the dominant carrier in Detroit. And it
will save Chrysler and GM as much as $3 million and $6 million a
year, respectively, they said.
</P>
<P>
   While the terms of the agreements have largely been completed,
Chrysler and GM are still waiting for assurances from city
authorities that certain improvements will be made at Detroit City
Airport, where Pro Air is based.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are hoping to get it closed by Friday,'' Peter Rowe, a GM
spokesman, said of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The deal comes as the last-minute walk-up fares paid most often
by businesses are at record levels and there is heightened concern
in Washington about the lack of competition at many of the
country's major airports. Earlier this year, Transportation
Department proposed new guidelines designed to prevent major
airlines from driving small upstart carriers out of their home
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses, such as Kimberly-Clark Corp. and Caterpillar Inc.,
have started or financed airlines (Midwest Express and Access Air,
respectively) in the past. And some have bailed out struggling
carriers by buying tickets in advance, as has been the case with
Trans World Airlines in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts say the Pro Air deal would be the first time that
major corporations have paid an airline a guaranteed monthly
retainer on a long-term basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first intervention by major corporations to lower
costs and provide some competition at a fortress hub,'' said Kevin
Mitchell, chairman of the Business Travel Coalition, a corporate
advocate who helped broker the agreement.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Northwest is considered one of the most aggressive of the major
airlines. It has been accused by low-cost challengers of a number
of practices to drive away low-cost challengers. It is being sued
by the Nevada-based Reno Air Inc., which contends that Northwest
unfairly cut its prices to less than its costs. Northwest denies it
competes unfairly.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest also has one of the tightest strangleholds on its hubs
of any major airline. It makes 82 percent of its daily takeoffs and
landings in Minneapolis and 79 percent in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Pro Air flies two 146-passenger 737 jets from Detroit to
Philadelphia, Newark, Indianapolis, Baltimore and, in the winter,
to Orlando and Fort Myers, Fla. It charges $59 to $79 one way for a
coach seat, and as much as $164 for first class. Pro Air does not
require passengers to stay over Saturday night, as many major
airlines do to force business travelers to pay higher fares.
</P>
<P>
   Since Pro Air began flying July 4, Northwest _ which flies out
of the outlying Detroit Metropolitan Airport _ has matched its
prices on every route, reducing its walk-up fares by as much as 85
percent and offering more seats than Pro Air can, said Kevin
Stamper, Pro Air's chief executive. Northwest has also offered
travel agencies higher commissions if they book passengers on
Northwest instead of on Pro Air.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a pretty serious competitive response,'' added
Stamper, 49. He is the son of Malcolm T. Stamper, the former vice
chairman of Boeing Co.
</P>
<P>
   The Pro Air chief and executives at Chrysler and GM declined to
say how much the companies have agreed to pay each month to Pro
Air, which has total revenues of only a few million dollars a
month. Stamper said that while the fees were not enough to cover
Pro Air's costs the money was ``very significant'' and would allow
the airline to expand into other markets. He also said he planned
to forge similar deals with other companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This clearly is a powerful thing for us,'' he said. ``If we
didn't get this, we might have to rely on government assistance
against predatory practices to make the airline work.''
</P>
<P>
   The contract, which is to last five years with an option to
renew for another five years, will let Chrysler and GM employees
reserve tickets on all of Pro Air's flights. Stamper said that the
airline would hold back some seats on flights to accommodate
last-minute travelers from the companies.
</P>
<P>
   Pro Air will also offer Chrysler and GM employees and their
families flights for $25 a seat on leisure trips, the same discount
given to Pro Air employees and their families.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Chrysler and GM, which receive volume discounts
from Northwest, were careful not to portray the agreement as a shot
at the larger airline, which could conceivably retaliate against
the companies if Pro Air fails.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our intent was never to replace our dominant carrier,'' said
Charles Braswell, the manager of general services at Chrysler. ``We
just think that competition is good.''
</P>
<P>
   Jon Austin, a spokesman at Northwest, said that the deal was
just the latest wrinkle in a highly competitive industry and that
Northwest expected to continue serving Chrysler and GM ``They've
made a determination that they want to make this type of
experiment,'' he added, ``and we will watch it closely.''

 &HT;    The latest chapter of `Will they go or not?'
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chicago -- Phil Jackson has hedged on whether he'd return to the
Bulls next season as coach.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan has left open the possibility, however remote,
that he would play another season in Chicago. But forward Scottie
Pippen has been adamant about this being his final week as a Bull.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's all said and done, I heard that Phil said if I come
back, he'll come back. That gives Michael an open window of
opportunity,'' Pippen said.
</P>
<P>
   But Pippen was contradictory in talking about his future. He's
said that he'd like to play in Phoenix or Houston next year. And
he's publicly ridiculed owner Jerry Reinsdorg and general manager
Jerry Krause in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said many times I don't want to come back here and
play,'' Pippen said. ``I plan to go out and explore all of my
options as a free agent. But if I'm offered the right thing, maybe
I would consider coming back if the guys are here and they're
looking forward to trying to win another title.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan said someone other than Jackson as coach of the Bulls and
Pippen not re-signed would indicate ``a rebuilding'' and give him
the signal he needs to quit for good.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson left open the slim possibility of returning after
Reinsdorf said weeks ago that he'd be ``inclined to invite everyone
back'' if the Bulls win their sixth championship in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   No Utah for Rodman
</P>
<P>
   Should the NBA Finals return to Salt Lake City, expect Dennis
Rodman to return to Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to go back to Utah,'' Rodman said. ``My life just
goes to complete hell when I go to Utah. That means I have to
revert to going to Las Vegas or going somewhere to get some
excitement, to try to keep my mind rolling.''
</P>
<P>
   Karl to coach Bulls?
</P>
<P>
   Fired Seattle coach George Karl was listed in Wednesday's
Chicago Tribune as a possible replacement for Jackson next year.
Krause refused comment on the matter, referring questions until
after the season and he and Reinsdorf evaluate the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Kerr on Jordan leaving
</P>
<P>
   Steve Kerr said he'd like to see Jordan retire after the season.
``Especially if we win it,'' Kerr said. ``There's nothing left for
him to prove, to do. He's done it all. He talks about going out on
top. What would be a better way to ride off into the sunset?''
</P>
<P>
   Mike on a mission
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's pet project is to get championship rings for the team
members who have not received one. He called Scott Burrell his
``project''.

FBI BACKGROUND CHECKS MAY ADD GUN TAX TO TEXAS BUYERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ People seeking to buy guns in Texas may have to pay
a federal surcharge of about $15 beginning this fall unless state
leaders decide to help the FBI conduct computerized background
checks on would-be purchasers, a senior Justice Department official
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the state offers its assistance, the FBI will charge
licensed gun dealers $15 per transaction, the agency's
administrative cost of conducting the background check, once the
computer system is in place Nov. 30. The federal fee is expected to
be passed on to the gun purchaser.
</P>
<P>
   The fee is designed to encourage Texas and 30 other as-yet
uncooperative states to assist the FBI in its high-tech effort to
check criminal records of would-be purchasers, added the official,
who asked not to be identified by name.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno said Wednesday that state assistance
is critical to the national effort to keep guns away from
criminals. States have the most thorough, accurate and up-to-date
records on the criminal histories of their residents, she added.
</P>
<P>
   ``The states are an important partner in our efforts to build a
National Instant Check System,'' Reno said, referring to the FBI's
computer program. ``By working together in the coming months and
the coming years, state and federal law enforcement have a real
opportunity to keep guns out of the wrong hands and provide for
safer streets and safer communities.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI wants _ but the law does not require _ each state to
have a ``point of contact,'' a state official responsible for
assisting the federal agency in its effort to collect data on
prospective buyers, Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one knows more about state records than the states
themselves, and the system will work better if the states
participate in the National Instant Check System,'' the attorney
general said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the FBI's computerized system, prospective gun purchasers
would fill out a federal form seeking information about their
backgrounds. The consumer presumably would pay the FBI's fee to the
gun dealer, who would in turn access the computer system.
</P>
<P>
   The computerized background check would be completed within
minutes, and the dealer would be informed instantly whether the
sale may be made or if the check revealed information that needed
further examination. The FBI would then inform the gun dealer
within three days if the sale may be completed or if the purchaser
failed the background check, the Justice Department official said.
</P>
<P>
   The Brady law requires that firearms not be sold to indicted or
convicted felons, fugitives, illegal aliens or people who have
renounced their U.S. citizenship, been dishonorably discharged from
the military, have a record of domestic violence or been adjudged
mentally incompetent. People denied guns have a right to appeal
their rejection, but none of the more than 200,000 people rejected
under the 1993 Brady law have appealed, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   To preserve the would-be buyer's privacy, the computer will not
reveal why a prospective purchaser was rejected, the official
added.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said creating a computer system that will encompass more
than 60,000 gun dealers nationwide and account for the more than 11
million guns sold each year has presented a ``great challenge'' for
the Justice Department. ``But the prospect of making America's
streets and communities safer makes it all worthwhile and all the
more important,'' she added.

   If two new CDs by the English violinist Andrew Manze are any

music's most venerable but useless assumptions. To wit, the funny
notion abroad among classical-music reviewers that the best thing a
performer can do is disappear.

   Ian Bostridge, an English tenor, was warmly praised recently for
what one critic somewhat infelicitously called his
``self-elimination'' during a performance of Schumann's
``Dichterliebe,'' of all things. Pianists and violinists who fail
to duplicate Bostridge's feat during concerto appearances regularly
take their lumps, in these pages and elsewhere, for distracting the
audience's attention from ``the music.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the complaint is voiced just as frequently in reviews of
recordings, the offending distractions must be not merely visual
(up-thrown limbs, tossing manes, whatever) but aural, too. Yet what
can it mean to say that the sounds of the performance distract from
the music? Aren't those sounds the music?
</P>
<P>
   Apparently not. ``My God, what has sound got to do with music!''
Charles Ives wrote in one of his blustery ``Memos.'' Or, as Sir
Thomas Beecham once opined, ``The British public doesn't really
care for music, but it simply adores the noise it makes.''
</P>
<P>
   Contempt for crowd-pleasing virtuosos is often touted as a blow
against Romanticism, that all-purpose punching bag. But critics who
distinguish between the sounds and the music share with Ives and
Beecham the assumption that a piece of music _ ``great'' music,
anyway _ is a fixed and sacrosanct ``idea'' rather than a bunch of
noises that may vary greatly from performance to performance.
</P>
<P>
   That is idealism, and idealism is Romanticism at its most
extreme. Romanticism's transition into its ``late, late'' phase
called modernism (as the music scholar Leonard B. Meyer so
delightfully puts it) can be gauged by noting the mounting
hostility toward performers as the 20th century reached its middle.
</P>
<P>
   For Arnold Schoenberg, whose career actually enacted the move
from late Romanticism to late-late, performance was at best a
necessary evil, of value only to those lacking the skills required
to derive the full experience of a musical composition from silent
perusal of the score.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre Boulez, in his bomb-throwing youth, actually declared
performances obsolete for contemporary music, since the only
information of interest to intelligent musicians was the kind that
notation conveyed to the eye, and the eye to the mind. Hearing
added nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Even Brahms, more than half a century before the peak phase,
voiced a kindred thought when he turned down an invitation to
Mozart's ``Don Giovanni'' with the remark that if he sat at home
with the score, he'd hear a better performance.
</P>
<P>
   Mozart would not have known what on earth Brahms was talking
about. In his pre-Romantic age, the score was not the sacred
repository of the fragile idea that critics were sworn to defend
against marauders. The score was simply what enabled a performance
and furnished its springboard. The more one bunch of notes thus
enabled varied from another, the better. The performer's
contribution was cherished and eagerly awaited.
</P>
<P>
   To fail to astonish or surprise _ in a word, to distract _ the
audience with one's novel take on the familiar would have been
regarded as an insult. Performers who self-eliminated could expect
to be flushed away.
</P>
<P>
   Of no one was this truer than of Mozart himself. As we know from
the deliberately incomplete notation of the scores, he left himself
plenty of room for spontaneous display in his own concertos and
expected the same of anybody else who played them. That is why it
has always been so bizarre, even if inevitable, that early-music
performers, though they specialize in pre-Romantic repertory, have
been especially prone to impose on themselves all the puritanical
inhibitions with which Romantic idealism has shackled the
performance of classical music.
</P>
<P>
   The result, we may as well admit, has been pious boredom. How
could it be otherwise, when notations meant as springboards for
fancy diving are treated as holy writ? You might as well stare at a
diving board and call it the Olympics. What early music has been
needing even more urgently than other branches of classical music
has been a new infusion of old-fashioned _ truly old-fashioned _
performerly values: not self-elimination but self-asserting,
crowd-pleasing exhibitionism and vulgarity, the kind for which
Mozart was famous, and Handel, and Vivaldi.
</P>
<P>
   For some time, the only promising figure on the horizon has been
the pianist Robert Levin, happily more famous than notorious by now
for his improvised cadenzas, florid embellishments and other
distractions from ``the music'' of Mozart's concertos.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is another: Manze, who in a pair of new Harmonia Mundi
CDs of music by Vivaldi (``Concert for the Prince of Poland,'' HMU
907230) and Giuseppe Tartini (``The Devil's Sonata and Other
Works,'' HMU 907213) combines formidable fiddling virtuosity with a
truly baroque (that is, over-the-top) taste for the outlandish.
</P>
<P>
   What results from this cross-fertilization _ especially in the
astonishing Tartini disc, where Mr. Manze goes it alone,
unaccompanied and under high magnification, for 68 minutes of
enthralling mischief _ is one of the most encouraging defiances of
late-late Romantic taste I've heard in years.
</P>
<P>
   The Vivaldi program reconstructs the evening of March 21, 1740,
when Friedrich Christian, the German heir to the Polish throne
(and, incidentally, the son of Bach's nominal patron) paid a visit
to the Ospedale della Pieta, the Venetian foundling home for girls
where Vivaldi spent many years as music master. Four of the
composer's most colorfully scored orchestral works were played in
the visitor's honor to frame a performance of a serenata, or choral
ode, that has not survived.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: A crime of hate: Bigotry and racism still thrive in
East Texas
 &HT;    By Ernest Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   James Byrd Jr. died the worst kind of death. He died chained to
the back of a pickup as it dragged him along a two-mile stretch of
backroads in Jasper County.
</P>
<P>
   But worst of all, James Byrd Jr. died because he was black.
</P>
<P>
   Jasper is no different than most of rural East Texas. God and
country are held in the highest esteem. But there is a seamy side,
a cruel side that all too often rears its ugly head. Racism is
alive and well and it bubbled to the surface in Jasper.
</P>
<P>
   East Texas is more like the Deep South than the rest of Texas in
its social mores. There is a lot of quiet support for the Klan. But
a lot of people are afraid to come out and publicly demonstrate
because of the social repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   James Byrd Jr. was an innocent victim who became an easy target
for a lot of pent up hatred.
</P>
<P>
   He had left a niece's bridal shower Saturday night to walk home,
his usual way of travel since he didn't own a car. He apparently
accepted a ride from the three men accused of the brutal murder
early Sunday and was last seen riding in the back of the truck,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   When he was found, he was so badly disfigured that investigators
had to use fingerprints to identify him. His head and right arm
were torn from his body. A smear of blood here. His dentures. A
piece of ravaged flesh there.
</P>
<P>
   It is a modern-day lynching, but instead of a rope slung over a
tree limb, it's a chain and a pickup.
</P>
<P>
   A cruel and unusual punishment for a man who needed a ride and
happened to be black.
</P>
<P>
   Assurances from the Jasper County sheriff that there are no
Aryan Nation or Ku Klux Klan organizations in the county drew hoots
from blacks at a news conference. The white community in East Texas
likes to think such organizations are a thing of the past. The
black community knows better.
</P>
<P>
   For too long racism and bigotry have been allowed to fester
because it is something that's not discussed in polite society.
Better to look away than face the unseemly reality that perhaps
were not so forgiving as we think.
</P>
<P>
   The inhuman tragedy that has riveted the attention of the nation
on East Texas is not something that can be ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Race relations have come a long way, but with the torture and
grisly murder of James Byrd Jr., it is clear we have a much longer
road ahead.

 UNDATED: not survived.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the present disc these pieces _ a sinfonia for strings, and
concertos for lute and viola d'amore, for violin and ``echo
violins,'' and for a large band including early clarinets and
mandolins _ are dispatched neatly and (as usual) all too
respectfully by the Academy of Ancient Music, the London-based
ensemble founded by Christopher Hogwood.
</P>
<P>
   The spectacular items are the two titled concertos, both from
Vivaldi's Opus 8 (which also contains the ``Four Seasons''), that
Manze performs in place of the missing serenata.
</P>
<P>
   In ``La Tempesta di Mare'' (``Storm at Sea''), the turbulent
outer movements are performed appropriately, to say the least. But
the special moment comes in the Largo, where Manze deploys some
weird timbres and articulations, and a gruesome cadenza inserted
just where the harmony is at its purplest, to evoke, and possibly
transmit, a case of seasickness. (Is it just my depraved
imagination, or is he parodying for this purpose some of the
mannerisms of Dutch-style ``Baroque'' fiddling, vintage 1970?)
</P>
<P>
   In ``Il Piacere'' (``Something to Please''), Manze disrupts the
last movement with a stunning cadenza of bariolage, or wild
string-crossing, inspired (as he admits) by Tartini but reminiscent
of another German visitor's description of Vivaldi's own playing.
At the end of an aria, the traveler reported, Vivaldi ``added an
improvisation that really frightened me, for I doubt anything like
it was ever done before, or ever will be again: he came to within a
hairbreadth of the bridge, leaving no room for the bow, and this on
all four strings, with imitations and at an incredible speed.''
</P>
<P>
   It only remains to add that Manze's frightening playing here, as
everywhere, is perfectly in tune, as I'll bet Vivaldi's was not.
Perfect intonation is something recordings have enforced.
</P>
<P>
   But the Tartini devil-disc is the one every violinist should
hear. The title piece, Tartini's most famous, is the one that
(according to the composer's proto-Paganinian boast) came to him in
a dream when he handed his violin to the Devil ``to see if he might
manage some pretty tunes; but imagine my astonishment when I heard
a sonata so unusual and so beautiful, performed with such mastery
and intelligence, on a level I had never before conceived was
possible!''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the disc contains two other sonatas, one an
old-fashioned long-winded affair ending in an ``aria'' with five
virtuoso variations, the other a Pastorale in a ``scordatura,'' or
special tuning, that imitates bagpipes. Finally there is a
selection from Tartini's treatise ``L'Arte del Arco'' (``The Art of
the Bow''), a colossal violinistic track meet consisting of dozens
of variations on a gavotte by Arcangelo Corelli, the Baroque
fiddler's patron saint.
</P>
<P>
   As ``music,'' none of this amounts to much. The sounds, however,
as Manze emits them, are magic. And that is because Manze has
recovered the pre-Romantic, pre-idealistic aesthetic that gives
them life. Although Tartini published his pieces with figured bass,
Manze plays them without accompaniment, the way Tartini said he
preferred.
</P>
<P>
   This means that Manze, like Tartini before him, wreaks total
havoc with the score as written, adding chords wholesale (some of
them quite weird, like Vivaldi's), transposing by octaves ad lib
and indulging speculatively in all kinds of violinistic effects
that were not only unwritten but unwritable at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Without any prompting save informed imagination and native
chutzpah, the violinist plays sul tasto (bowing over the
fingerboard for ethereal effects) and sul ponticello (bowing close
to the bridge for ghostly ones). He slides achingly whenever he
feels like it, not only between widely spaced notes but also
between consecutive scale degrees.
</P>
<P>
   He plays open and stopped notes in unison, then bends the pitch
of the latter to produce a grotesquely expressive wow. He doubles
pitches at the third, adds swells and tremolos, interpolates
pizzicatos and natural harmonics with abandon. With his bow he
produces a range of colors and articulations never before heard on
``Baroque'' violin.
</P>
<P>
   In the Pastorale, he even tweaks up the fourth degree of the
scale by a quarter-tone or so, the way actual rustic bagpipes often
do.
</P>
<P>
   In short, he never lets you forget he's there, adding his skills
and inspiration to those of the composer, as often as not upstaging
him. And what emerges is a violinistic masterpiece, in which
abstract composing and real-time performing have merged _ or
remerged, since that is how it used to be _ into a single act.
</P>
<P>
   It is the most convincing ``period performance'' I have ever
heard, which of course is not to say that it is anything other than
make-believe. But the chaste literalism that we're used to, and
that has been stifling classical music, is also make-believe _ and,
for early music, the greater anachronism.
</P>
<P>
   Let's leave the self-eliminators to their appropriately sterile
repertory (roughly middle Stravinsky to early Princeton) and stop
policing the rest. Manze's version of historically informed
performance can point the way toward a healthy desterilization. I
wish him lots of competition.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Forget Godzilla. A real sea monster arrived in
Manhattan Wednesday, slimy and long, a colossus of the deep famous
in lore and for centuries the stuff of nightmares.
</P>
<P>
   A giant squid, one of the rarest and least-understood animals on
the planet, was flown from New Zealand to Kennedy Airport, and then
trucked to the American Museum of Natural History, on Central Park
West. The beast had been frozen solid.
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday, museum scientists watched anxiously as the
infamous creature was slowly revealed in its hideous glory, its
tentacles and body curled up in a cramped packing case, its huge
eyes hidden from sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tremendously exciting,'' said Neil Landman, curator of
invertebrates at the museum. ``To have a look at an actual giant
squid is a dream I've always had. It's gorgeous.''
</P>
<P>
   Very little is known about them. The giants are believed to be
one of the largest of all the world's creatures that have no
backbones, growing to lengths of 60 feet and perhaps much more.
Giant squids have 10 large tentacles lined with sucker pads and a
reputation for ruthlessness. Their huge eyes are apparently the
largest in the animal kingdom, sometimes the size of dinner plates.
</P>
<P>
   Fishermen towing nets through the depths have snagged giant
squids on occasion, and dead or dying ones have been known to wash
ashore, often half eaten by birds and sea life.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's squid, though a baby, is 25 feet long. Caught in
December by fishermen in New Zealand, it is in an excellent state
of preservation and is possibly the best giant squid specimen in
existence, excited museum officials said Wednesday. Museum
scientists plan to inject it with preservative as soon as it is
sufficently thawed.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-foot baby joins the museum's 46-foot model of an adult
giant squid, which is featured in the new biodiversity hall.
</P>
<P>
   The museum plans to study the squid carefully and perhaps
eventually to put it on public display, which will depend partly on
how well it survives the rigors of thawing. Though the animal is
immature, the scientists say they should be able to determine its
sex.
</P>
<P>
   Landman added that the giants were so poorly understood that the
age of the 25-foot specimen was a total mystery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it 2 years old? Five years old? One hundred years old?
Nobody knows. And nobody knows the depth that these animals live
at. I'm involved in a project trying to answer those questions.''
It appears that creatures of the deep typically live much longer
than those on the planet's surface.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Ellis, an author and sea-life expert who helped arrange
for the squid's arrival, was bubbling with excitement Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't come up Broadway in a motorcade with flags flying,
but it should have,'' he said, half seriously. ``This is the
greatest event in New York City squid history.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Very few people have had an opportunity to examine one of
these things,'' he went on. ``It's unknown. It's huge. And it's
potentially dangerous. So far, they haven't attacked anyone that we
know of. It's all very exciting.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The museum's beast almost got away. In Los Angeles, after the
flight from New Zealand, the squid and its packing case proved too
heavy for the aircraft that was scheduled to take it the rest of
the way. So it had to wait. As a result, the squid landed late at
Kennedy, in the afternoon rather than the morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really pleased that it got onto the next flight,'' said
Landman, the curator. ``There were a lot of pins and needles.''
Among the uncertainties was what might happen if the giant specimen
started to thaw or emit a strong odor while passing through
Customs.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the squid had to go through Customs twice, in
both Los Angeles and New York, delaying its arrival still further.
</P>
<P>
   Steve O'Shea, a marine scientist at the National Institute of
Water and Atmospheric Research in Wellington, New Zealand, who
accompanied the squid on its flight, said the giant had been
captured by commercial fishermen and frozen immediately. The baby,
he added, was one of several recent catches.
</P>
<P>
   O'Shea said the squid was a gift from the New Zealand agency to
the museum, which paid about $10,000 for its transportation.
</P>
<P>
   As the creature left New Zealand, a Wellington newspaper
headline read, ``Squidzilla Takes On Manhattan.''
</P>
<P>
   The giant squid is a staple of novels and horror movies. But for
biologists it is a mystery. No one has ever observed the beast in
its natural habitat, despite decades of probing the sea's dim
recesses. Last year, a $5 million expedition to New Zealand failed
to find one of the monsters.
</P>
<P>
   Over the centuries the giant squid has inspired countless tales
of ogres, including the kraken, legendary sea monsters off Norway.
Modern impressions began to form with Jules Verne's ``20,000
Leagues Under the Sea,'' published in 1870.
</P>
<P>
   In the 20th century, sightings, captures and strandings revealed
that the giant squid was ubiquitous throughout the sea, though very
reclusive.
</P>
<P>
   Modern scientists have repeatedly tried to catch the beast and
observe it in its deep lair, using nets on long lines, submersibles
equipped with bright lights and cameras, and lately robots tied to
long tethers _ always to no avail. Only fishermen have made
successful hauls, always by accident. But lacking the ability or
interest to preserve the huge specimens, fishermen typically take a
picture or two before throwing the carcass overboard, leaving
biologists to lament the lost treasure.
</P>
<P>
   All that began to change in the last decade off New Zealand.
Fishermen and scientists there worked to develop a series of deep
commercial fisheries, going after exotic fish for the consumer
market.
</P>
<P>
   They began occasionally hauling up giant squids that were
apparently feeding on dense schools of fish at depths of nearly a
mile.
</P>
<P>
   O'Shea, who is in charge of collecting giant squid data
throughout New Zealand waters, from both government and commercial
vessels, said Wednesday that recent specimens were in beautiful
shape, most especially the one acquired by the museum.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, he said, dead animals have often been a shambles,
hacked into pieces by fishermen or so bruised and abraded that
parts were unrecognizable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best specimen that we've had,'' O'Shea said of the
museum's acquisition. ``It's not the largest, but it's the best.''

 &HT;    The latest chapter of `Will they go or not?'
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chicago -- Phil Jackson has hedged on whether he'd return to the
Bulls next season as coach.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan has left open the possibility, however remote,
that he would play another season in Chicago. But forward Scottie
Pippen has been adamant about this being his final week as a Bull.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's all said and done, I heard that Phil said if I come
back, he'll come back. That gives Michael an open window of
opportunity,'' Pippen said.
</P>
<P>
   But Pippen was contradictory in talking about his future. He's
said that he'd like to play in Phoenix or Houston next year. And
he's publicly ridiculed owner Jerry Reinsdorg and general manager
Jerry Krause in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said many times I don't want to come back here and
play,'' Pippen said. ``I plan to go out and explore all of my
options as a free agent. But if I'm offered the right thing, maybe
I would consider coming back if the guys are here and they're
looking forward to trying to win another title.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan said someone other than Jackson as coach of the Bulls and
Pippen not re-signed would indicate ``a rebuilding'' and give him
the signal he needs to quit for good.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson left open the slim possibility of returning after
Reinsdorf said weeks ago that he'd be ``inclined to invite everyone
back'' if the Bulls win their sixth championship in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   No Utah for Rodman
</P>
<P>
   Should the NBA Finals return to Salt Lake City, expect Dennis
Rodman to return to Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to go back to Utah,'' Rodman said. ``My life just
goes to complete hell when I go to Utah. That means I have to
revert to going to Las Vegas or going somewhere to get some
excitement, to try to keep my mind rolling.''
</P>
<P>
   Karl to coach Bulls?
</P>
<P>
   Fired Seattle coach George Karl was listed in Wednesday's

METS HANG ON TO DEFEAT DEVILRAYS, 3-2  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JASON DIAMOS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even with the significant addition of Mike Piazza to the lineup,
pitching and defense are what have won games for the Mets the
majority of the time this season. And for a staff that was
criticized before the season for lacking a front-line starter, Al
Leiter certainly has pitched like an ace.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter was in a constant struggle for command of his pitches
Wednesday at Shea Stadium, but he fought his way through six
innings of one-run ball and the Mets had just enough for a 3-2
victory over the expansion Tampa Bay Devil Rays. It was Leiter's
seventh victory in 10 decisions, and it lowered the veteran
left-hander's earned run average to 1.70, second in the National
League to Atlanta's perennial Cy Young award winner, Greg Maddux
(1.69).
</P>
<P>
   In 12 starts for the Mets, Leiter has allowed just 15 earned
runs in 791/3 innings. He has been on a seasonlong roll.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's pitching as good as about anybody in the league,''
Manager Bobby Valentine said after watching Leiter allow just four
hits while striking out nine with his 116 pitches. ``He's pitched
really well and taken no-decisions and losses. And he's pitched
without his best stuff and gotten wins.''
</P>
<P>
   With luck, Leiter, who has won his last four starts, could have
10 or 11 victories. It is becoming likely that he will be heading
to his second All-Star Game in four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to call him an ace or an All-Star or the best
pitcher in the league, please do,'' Valentine said. ``I think of
him as one of my fingers. And I'm not sure any one is more
important to me than any other.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because with a rotation of Leiter, Bobby Jones, Masato
Yoshii, Rick Reed and Hideo Nomo, the Mets are off to their best
60-game start in 10 years. And all the starters, with the exception
of the newly acquired Nomo, have contributed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, since Leiter is now 3-0 after Met losses _ he would be
4-0 had the bullpen not blown a save in Houston on April 28 _ the
argument could be made that he has gradually filled the role of
stopper.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're not feeling good about yourself, you feel like the
world is falling in on you, or that what can go wrong will go
wrong,'' Leiter said. ``I don't feel that way. I feel I can get out
of any jam that comes up.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday was an example. His first five pitches were balls, and
the first two Devil Rays reached base. But Leiter, eschewing the
changeups and fastballs on the outer edge of the plate that he has
added to his repertory this season _ bore down to strike out the
side, leaving runners at second and third.
</P>
<P>
   After the Mets scored two runs in the bottom of the first on
five walks by the starter Rick White, Leiter left another runner on
base in the second by inducing White to bounce into a double play.
Even when Leiter allowed his only run, on a double by Mike DiFelice
in the fourth, he came back to strike out Kevin Stocker. It was the
second time he struck out the side.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Leiter said he feels that he is pitching the same as
when he went 16-12 two years ago for the Florida Marlins with the
third-best ERA (2.93) in the league. That was his All-Star year.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter was quick to credit the Mets' defense for much of his
success this season. On the double play, third baseman Edgardo
Alfonzo and second baseman Carlos Baerga both made nifty plays.
Baerga also made a heady play in the sixth when he fielded a
short-hop throw from Piazza to cut down Paul Sorrento, who was
trying to steal second with two out in a 2-1 game.
</P>
<P>
   That play was magnified when Butch Huskey laced a home run in
the Mets' sixth to raise their lead to 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   For Leiter, a major positive has been his ability to click with
Piazza, the All-Star catcher the Mets traded for on May 22.
Leiter's fastball and slider have as much movement as anyone's in
the league, and Piazza conceded that ``he's definitely tough to
catch.'' Yet Leiter, who teamed with Piazza on a four-hit shutout
in the catcher's first game as a Met, is 3-0 with a 1.64 e.r.a.
with him behind the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Piazza, still nursing a sore left hand from being hit
by a pitch in Boston last Friday night, did not suffer a little
from catching Leiter Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of gritting my teeth every time I caught the
ball,'' he said. ``The hardest part about catching him is when he
wreaks havoc on your hand.''

SAN FRANCISCO AIRPORT UNDERGOES MAJOR OVERHAUL

   SAN BRUNO, Calif. _ Summer vacationers and business travelers
hurrying through San Francisco International Airport these days are
being confronted with debris, dust and delays as a new
glass-and-steel, six-story terminal with a Disneyland look rises
above a landscape of concrete forms and twisted rebar.
</P>
<P>
   Scheduled to open in the spring of 2000, the new International
Terminal will double the size of the airport. It will feature a
light-rail shuttle system, new boarding gates for the larger
next-generation jumbo jets, more automobile parking, new sweeping
roadways to Highway 101, which is being widened, and a Bay Area
Rapid Transit commuter rail station.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're literally building a new airport on top of the old
airport,'' said Ron Wilson, airport communications director. ``It's
the largest airport project currently in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   But the massive $2.4 billion project won't fix the airport's
inadequate runway system, designed in 1930 and responsible for
chronic delays when the weather turns foul, making San Francisco
airport one of the nation's worst for on-time performance.
</P>
<P>
   Solving that problem is the next step. Airport officials hired a
consultant last week to consider how to build a new runway to allow
full operation in bad weather.
</P>
<P>
   The spacious new terminal is designed to handle 12 million
passengers by 2006. One goal is to get arriving travelers off the
plane, through Customs _ set up to handle 5,000 people an hour _
and out the door in 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The new ticket counters will stretch a quarter of a mile long,
almost three times the length of present international terminal
counters.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The project is creating its share of disruptions on the ground,
causing some traffic snarls as it funnels cars and buses to the
existing terminals through tunnel-like construction zones and a
confusing web of lanes. The road narrows for taxicabs and shuttle
buses picking up arriving passengers.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, travelers find the construction irritating,
but not a major headache.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easily confusing,'' said Linda Stephens of San Mateo, who
was picking up employees of an accounting firm last week for a
training session. ``If we're a Pacific Rim capital, we need better.
It's been the pits for years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pain in the neck, but what are you going to do?''
commented Mike Martin of Orange County. ``It seems every airport in
the country is expanding right now. It gets so you don't pay
attention to it anymore.'''
</P>
<P>
   Construction doesn't seem to pose a major problem for passengers
arriving for flights, but it does cause delays for shuttle buses
and people picking up travelers on the lower roadway, which is
narrower because of debris and heavy equipment parked on it.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said the airport needs the new international terminal to
handle the tremendous growth in overseas travel.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 38 million passengers who passed through San Francisco
International in 1996, 18 percent were traveling overseas, 60
percent of them to Japan and other Pacific Rim nations. The volume
is almost equally divided between tourists and business travelers
from both the United States and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The demand for international travel has climbed by 10 percent
a year, primarily for Asia and the Pacific Rim, because of the
economy there,'' Wilson said. ``Even European travel was up last
year by 16 percent. That's a trend we see continuing for the next
10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   By 2006, projections are for 12 million international
passengers. Domestic travel, which has been flat, also is expected
to climb, Wilson said, to 39 million domestic passengers by 2006.
In 1996, domestic and international volume was 31 million and 7
million passengers, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Travel is becoming easier, people have more disposable income
and the U.S. is a popular destination for international travel,''
Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the increase in passenger demand, another reason behind
the upgrade is that the current international terminal is outmoded.
The current fleet of 400-passenger jumbo jets doesn't even fit the
old-style boarding gates, sticking out past the apron and taking up
1 1/2 spaces. And some aircraft manufacturers are considering
building even bigger, 600-passenger planes.
</P>
<P>
   The new terminal will have room for 26 jumbo jets at the
boarding areas, the ability to handle the baggage from 12 flights
at once, and, at 2 million square feet, is as large as the present
domestic and international terminals combined.
</P>
<P>
   The three-terminal complex is now shaped like a horseshoe and
the new terminal will effectively close the open gap. The existing
international terminal will be used for domestic travelers, along
with the south and north terminals.
</P>
<P>
   The project includes two new parking garages for international
travelers, with 3,000 parking spaces. The present garage has 3,500
short-term and 7,000 long-term parking spots.
</P>
<P>
   A light-rail system will traverse the airport, running at two-to
three-minute intervals between the terminals, the new rental car
area, remote parking lots, and airline maintenance and cargo
facilities. Each of the electric trains can carry 210 people and
run at about 25 mph.
</P>
<P>
   BART, the rapid transit system serving the San Francisco area,
will have a line running from its San Bruno station to the
international terminal, stopping 250 feet away from the ticket
counters.
</P>
<P>
   Some problems are inevitable, but few people were complaining
last week at the airport, where there was the usual lineup of cars,
taxis and shuttles dropping people off and picking them up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Portland is much worse than this,'' said Carl Loar of Medford,
Ore., referring to a $141 million project to enlarge that airport's
terminal, build new entry roads and cover the parking lot. ``It's a
real mess up there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The dust bothers me more than anything, but it's for a good
cause, so I put up with it,'' said Carol Mason of Tiburon, a United
Airlines flight attendant who flies from San Francisco weekly.
``People understand that we will have something nice in the end.''

FILM SHEDS LIGHT ON EMOTIONAL ISSUES OF THE DEAF 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DINITIA SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A fierce thunderstorm rips through the night and wakens the
little girl at the beginning of ``Beyond Silence,'' a new movie by
the German director Caroline Link about the hearing child of two
deaf parents. Night noises are the child's noises, heard only by
the children of the deaf while their parents sleep on. The little
girl runs to wake her mother and father, seeking comfort.
``Lightning is loud,'' the father says, in sign language.
``Lightning is silent, like the moon,'' the little girl responds.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety percent of deaf parents have children with normal
hearing, and ``Beyond Silence,'' which was nominated for an Academy
Award this year for best foreign film, is a story of the conflict
between isolation and belonging that occurs so often in such
families.
</P>
<P>
   In his review of the film in The New York Times, Stephen Holden
praised it as ``a powerful metaphor for the inevitable
communication gap between children and parents in even the happiest
of homes,'' though he criticized it for having a ``sentimental
ending as various estranged characters reconnect in pat, teary-eyed
encounters.''
</P>
<P>
   In the film, Ms. Link, who is not deaf, touches on some of the
most highly charged issues in deaf culture: oral language vs. sign
language, the role of music, and the hearing children of deaf
parents.
</P>
<P>
   Lara, played as a little girl by Tatjana Trieb and as a young
woman by Sylvie Testud, in effect becomes a parent to her parents,
who are played by two of the deaf world's best-known actors, Howie
Seago, an American, and Emmanuelle Laborit of France.
</P>
<P>
   The child interprets at parent-teacher conferences, often to her
own advantage, and with sometimes amusing results. She breaks the
news to her father that he won't be getting his Christmas bonus
this year.
</P>
<P>
   When her aunt, who is not deaf, gives her a clarinet and she
takes up the instrument, Lara is caught in the middle of the
lifelong conflict between her father and his own parents and
siblings, who refuse to communicate with him in sign language,
leaving him to catch what he can by reading their lips, and casting
him to the margins of family life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a special, unique childhood situation,'' said Ms. Link,
who got the idea for the movie after reading an article about a
hearing woman who was raised by deaf parents. ``It is sometimes
funny because she &UR;  &LR; takes advantage of the situation,'' she said of
the little girl in the film. ``At the same time it is too much for
her to have to negotiate the world for her parents.''
</P>
<P>
   In researching the film, Ms. Link said, she became entranced by
the visual power and beauty of sign language. Indeed, one of the
film's most compelling scenes is a religious service filmed at the
Johann Baptist Church in Munich, Germany, with hundreds of deaf
worshippers signing the liturgy in unison.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the movie reflects the life stories of both its
principal actors, Ms. Laborit and Seago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born deaf and proud of it,'' Seago, 43, said in a recent
interview through a sign-language interpreter. ``I grew up deaf and
I hope I'm going to die deaf,'' he said with a laugh. Seago is
known primarily for his portrayal of the title role in Peter
Sellars' production of ``Ajax,'' about the Greek warrior known for
his size and strength. And he brings to the role of the father in
``Beyond Silence'' some of Ajax's desolation and isolation.
</P>
<P>
   As the deaf father of two hearing sons, Ryan, 12 and Kyle, 8
(his wife can hear), Seago knows something of the problems that can
arise in families with deaf parents and children who have normal
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have selective deafness,'' Seago said of his sons,
speaking through a sign-language interpreter. ``They're only deaf
when they want to be. I'll be signing to them and they'll look away
when they want to pretend they haven't heard what I'm saying. In
public I will look at my sons, they'll interpret for me, but we try
not to do that. If we depend on them, they can use that against us.
It can become a battleground.''
</P>
<P>
   Inherent in the film is the struggle in today's deaf world
between advocates of oralism _ or teaching the deaf to speak and
read lips in the belief that it will help them assimilate more
readily _ and proponents of sign language, the complex web of
gestures which is the hallmark of deaf culture.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, oralism still prevails. In the United States, nearly
half the states now recognize American Sign Language as a foreign
language, and some school curriculums offer it as a second
language. Still, some linguists oppose recognition of Sign, as it
is sometimes known, as a true language, arguing that it is an
invented form of communication.
</P>
<P>
   Seago, the son of a father with a hearing impairment and a
mother who can hear, was brought up in a world where sign language
was essentially forbidden. He can speak quite clearly orally, but
says he prefers to communicate in Sign because he can express and
detect more.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father,'' like the father in the movie, Seago said, ``lived
in a hearing world. He spoke and lip read. He didn't know sign
language.'' Seago's two brothers suffered from varying degrees of
hearing loss, but for the most part, his family communicates
orally. ``In a family situation, I'm left out,'' he said.

   Refusal to Sign as a Family Barrier
</P>
<P>
   In the film Seago's father and sister also refuse to communicate
with him in sign language. In one scene, Seago's character
confronts his sister, who he feels is stealing his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't sign with me, you don't communicate with me,'' Seago
said, paraphrasing his character's plea to her, which is delivered
in a series of impassioned gestures. After a tragic event brings
the film to a resolution, the fact that his sister finally speaks
to him in Sign ``is a form of reconciliation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting of ``Beyond Silence'' was something of a festival
of sign language. There are hundreds of different sign languages,
almost as many as there are spoken languages. For the production,
Seago, who speaks American Sign, and Ms. Laborit, who speaks French
Sign Language (Langue des Signes Francaise), both had to learn
German Sign Language (Deutsche Gebaerden Sprache).
</P>
<P>
   Off camera, Ms. Laborit and Seago were able to communicate
fairly easily. American Sign Language is partly derived from the
French because of the historical connection between the two. In the
19th century, Paris was the center of deaf education, and in 1816,
when Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet founded the first school for the deaf
in Connecticut, he invited a French deaf teacher, Laurent Clerc, to
teach his students how to sign.
</P>
<P>
   Like Seago, Ms. Laborit, 26, was born deaf. ``My parents were
shocked,'' she said in an interview, through an interpreter. But
later investigation revealed that Ms. Laborit had had deaf
ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   Despite France's tradition of sign language, oralism was the
dominant mode of communication among the deaf when she was growing
up. Only in 1991 was a law passed in France giving children the
right to choose between oralist and sign-language education.
Initially, doctors urged Ms. Laborit's parents to give her hearing
aids and to teach her to speak orally.
</P>
<P>
   Deaf Center Brings a Revelation
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, `Don't let her meet deaf people,''' Ms. Laborit
said. ``They said, `They'll contaminate her with their sign
language.''' But when she was 7, her mother took her to a program
at a deaf cultural center in Vincennes, a suburb of Paris. ``I saw
all that signing. I was dumbfounded.'' The whole family learned to
sign together, Ms. Laborit said.
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, Ms. Laborit, as the mother, is able to accept her
daughter's breaking away from the family to play music. At one
point she tells her husband: ``Accept your child the way she is.
You don't own her.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Link, who also wrote the script for the film, envisions the
mother's character as having had ``a pretty happy and healthy
childhood. She was accepted for the way she is. And she could
accept others.'' Indeed Ms. Laborit moves through the film as a
radiant presence, blithely unaware of her daughter's music.
</P>
<P>
   Music has always been the cultural boundary between the hearing
and the deaf. At one point, the daughter describes the music she is
playing on the clarinet as ``joyful and wild, and at the same time
sad and not really free.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a description of her situation,'' said Millie Brother,
the founder of Children of Deaf Adults (CODA), an organization of
the hearing children of deaf parents. ``Music is a culturally
charged topic in the deaf community. A lot of people see the loss
of music as a sadness for deaf people, but some deaf people see
music as not really needed.''
</P>
<P>
   It is no accident, said Ms. Brother, that her organization is
named after a musical term, CODA, a passage at the end of a
composition that relates to themes that came before but is slightly
altered, bringing the work to a close.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, said Ms. Link, the director, the subject of ``Beyond
Silence'' is not just deafness. ``It's about family communication.
It's about a girl who wants to leave home.''

PIAZZA CONVINCING METS HE KNOWS HOW TO CATCH  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLAIRE SMITH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It would not seem that a player of Mike Piazza's stature would
need to be reinvented. Yet since joining the Mets on May 22, Piazza
is happily using the change of scenery to also change the
perception of who and what he is.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza, a perennial All-Star as a Los Angeles Dodger because of
his ability as a hitter, has clearly made strides in his three
weeks with the Mets in convincing people that he knows what he is
doing behind the plate as well.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Piazza worked with Al Leiter through a six-inning,
nine-strikeout effort in a 3-2 victory over the Tampa Bay Devil
Rays, 11 days after he helped guide Leiter to 10 strikeouts against
the Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   Seven times in the 13 games Piazza has caught as a Met, the
opposition has scored three runs or fewer. Those seven games
include three shutouts. The first shutout came in Piazza's first
game with the Mets on May 23, when Leiter defeated the Brewers,
3-0. The most recent came on Monday against Tampa Bay, when Rick
Reed flirted with a perfect game for six and two-thirds innings
before settling for a three-hit, 3-0 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shook him off only once and only because he wanted me to,''
Reed said. ``All I ever heard was that he's a great hitter who
can't catch, but I tell you what, he's really busted his butt to
learn everyone, every pitch that they throw. He's done a great
job.''
</P>
<P>
   It helps that Piazza has inherited pitchers with more control of
their repertories than the lively, undisciplined arms of the young
Los Angeles Dodger staff had.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our staff is one that takes to a guy like Mike really well,''
Mets Manager Bobby Valentine said. ``He's a big target. He's well
prepared and they give it to him in the zone that he's looking
for.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, not every catcher converts such opportunities with ease.
``In my opinion, a guy who is not a good defensive catcher takes
pitches that are strikes and makes them balls by the way he catches
them,'' Valentine said. ``On the flip side, the good guy takes
those pitches that are borderline and makes them strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza, said Valentine, ``doesn't do the former and definitely
does the latter.'' And Piazza is not only framing pitches and
throwing out runners (6 of 12), but he is also calling games
without fear of passed balls or wild pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not afraid one bit to throw a curveball in the dirt,''
Bobby Jones said. ``I have the confidence that he's going to block
it. That's something a pitcher likes.''
</P>
<P>
   Leiter is not afraid to throw his slider, a tough pitch that can
also veer off course. Piazza called it often Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows it's a strength of mine and he's thinking with me,''
Leiter said.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza left the game after eight innings, partly because the
left hand struck by a Pedro Martinez fastball last week is still
sore, and he said later: ``I was kind of gritting my teeth every
time I caught the ball, but I just wanted to get on his page.''
</P>
<P>
   This speaks to Piazza's obvious effort to learn. ``I had the
impression that being the hitter that he is, when he gets into the
dugout the pitcher is some guy from a foreign land, but the pitcher
is the guy that he's sitting with,'' Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   Reed added: ``He talks catching, he talks pitching, he talks
about how he's going to approach the hitters the next inning. Where
he got the bad rap, I don't have any idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza, who has been slammed by former teammates like Brett
Butler and Ramon Martinez, is not only flattered by such praise,
but genuinely relieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously you're only human and you're going to hear it,'' the
catcher said of the criticism. ``So it's good to turn the page and
start a new chapter in your career. And no one here really listened
to anything. They just said, let him come in here and see how it is
to work with him. That's all you can ask for, as a professional, as
a person. What these guys did shows how much maturity there is on
this club.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets will not claim that they always assumed Piazza's
catching skills would make the transition seamless. Asked whether
he initially felt any trepidation about Piazza coming aboard,
Valentine replied: ``Yes. Originally I was concerned when I first
heard about a chance of this happening. And then I made inquiries
to a couple of people I trust and they said don't worry about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza is hardly the only catcher who has had to prove he can
catch. In Philadelphia, it was said that Bob Boone couldn't catch a
cold, but he went on to win praise as the quintessential man behind
the plate in Kansas City. And Gary Carter, a slugger like Piazza,
also had perceptions to overcome when he joined the Mets in 1985,
said Ed Lynch, a former Mets pitcher who is now the general manager
of the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before he joined the Mets we heard he was an offensive
catcher,'' Lynch said. ``But we found him to be an outstanding
catcher who happened to hit three-run home runs.''
</P>
<P>
   And what of Piazza, whom the Cubs pursued before the Marlins
sent him to the Mets? ``When you're that good, people are always
looking to knock you down, so they look at your defense,'' Lynch
said. ``I think it's an undeserved knock.''
</P>
<P>
   So, too, do the Mets, who seem happy to help Piazza prove it.

 (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)   Big Plans For Future Of Presidio  
   
 By Tom Abate  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
The Presidio is a relic of San Francisco's colonial past, but Jim
Meadows wants to make it a prototype for the cyberfuture.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Meadows is executive director of The Presidio Trust, the
quasi-public group charged with converting the former Army base
into a facility for a variety of civilian uses.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly who gets what already has become a controversy. But the
arguments so far have overlooked a hidden asset _ one that Meadows
thinks can fuel the Presidio's economic engine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a high-speed fiber optic loop already in place,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Internet age, having fiber in the ground is like a
building site being wired for electricity or plumbed for water and
sewage.
</P>
<P>
   Meadows plans to make this fiber loop the nerve center of a web
of multimedia, video and Internet-based enterprises. &UR;  &LR; One industry
he hopes to kick-start is the creation of distance-learning
broadcast centers for colleges.
</P>
<P>
   He also intends to plug all 1,600 housing units on the Presidio
into this fiber net, so folks at home will be able to hold
video-conferences with their offices or with other Presidio
families.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Meadows wants to turn the Presidio into San
Francisco's most wired neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't just some bureaucratic dream. Before he came to the
Presidio, Meadows managed the conversion of Denver's Lowry Air
Force Base. There, he created a fiber town with 4,000 wired homes
and many multimedia enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel it's an investment in the future,'' said Denver City
Councilwoman Polly Flobeck.
</P>
<P>
   Meadows expects to encounter envy and opposition from those not
lucky enough to land in this high-tech Garden of Eden.
</P>
<P>
   But he promised, ``There will be a broad range of opportunities
for people across the economic spectrum to live and work here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someday, all of San Francisco will be like this,'' he added.
``The fact that we can become a test bed for that 21st century city
is a plus and not a minus.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Wired voters? &LR;  ``All things in moderation'' might be the motto
of the largest single voting block in California, a group
identified as ``wired workers.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the gist of a new survey conducted by the Institute for
the New California, a public policy group in Walnut Creek. The INC
reached this conclusion after polling a scientific sample of
adults.
</P>
<P>
   The Institute defined wired workers as wage earners who worked
outside the home, used network-connected PCs on the job, and were
relatively free to organize their own workdays.
</P>
<P>
   Pollster Mike Hais said the survey respondents who fit this
definition identified themselves as independents, Republicans and
Democrats, in that order.
</P>
<P>
   They were heavily pro-choice on social issues, and moderate on
fiscal affairs. Their favorite politico was Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  Coincidence or not: The Institute was co-founded by Morley
Winograd, a former Bell executive who now serves as senior policy
adviser to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Bookmark it! &LR;  CMP, the Long Island-based trade-press
publisher, soon will unveil a new Web site that makes it easier to
find electronics industry information.
</P>
<P>
   CMP has taken the contents of dozens of its pubs _ among them EE
Times and Windows magazine _ and made it accessible from a single
page. It combines a search engine with a Yahoo-like set of
categories that point to sub-topics like semiconductors, PCs,
finance, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Other Web sites, notably Cnet and ZDNet, put tons of great
tech-type info online. But I think CMP has a better way to let
people quickly zero in on just what they want.
</P>
<P>
   The site won't be open to the public until Monday, but Chronicle
readers can get a peek today at  &LR; www.cmpnet.com/search. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Questionable taste? &LR;  If it's such a boom time in Silicon
Valley, why did a recent survey of car dealers find that the
lowball Ford Taurus was the top-selling car in Santa Clara County
last year, while the Mercedes-Benz E-class was 15th on the list?
</P>
<P>
   Got a tip, gripe or brainstorm? Tom Abate wants to hear it by
phone (650-961-2689), fax (650-961-5023) or e-mail (abate(at

 Antitrust Ringmaster   By Jonathan Marshall  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
When it comes to bouts between government antitrust authorities and
the heavyweights of high technology, few people have a better
ringside seat than University of California at Berkeley business
professor Carl Shapiro.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shapiro sits right at the center of action in this year's two
most celebrated antitrust cases. He is advising Intel Corp. in its
defense against the Federal Trade Commission and helped lead the
Justice Department's investigation of Microsoft from 1995 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   More important, Shapiro, 43, is one of a handful of academics
who have reshaped the theory and practice of antitrust enforcement
in the technology arena.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro is respected enough on both sides of the fence that even
as he represents Intel against the FTC, he is scheduled to testify
in court today for the FTC against the proposed mergers of four
pharmaceuticals distributors.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an enormously creative guy,'' said Gary Reback, a Palo
Alto attorney who represents high-tech companies. ``He has become
in antitrust circles one of the top testimonial economists. He has
an A+ mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys who have opposed Shapiro's positions offer the truest
testament to his reputation. Microsoft attorney Rick Rule, who
headed the Justice Department's antitrust division from 1986 to
1989, said ``even though I disagree with him on (the Microsoft
case), he's certainly one of the 10 economists that I as a lawyer''
would hire as an expert witness.
</P>
<P>
   George Cumming, a San Francisco attorney, crossed swords with
Shapiro in the early 1990s while representing Nintendo in an
antitrust suit filed by rival game-maker Atari Corp. Cumming
deposed Shapiro, who was an expert witness for Atari, for five
grueling days. ``I came away with a great deal of admiration for
him,'' Cumming said.
</P>
<P>
   Rule, Cumming and others who have worked with Shapiro say they
are as impressed by his charm and unassuming personality as his
brilliant intellect. Two of his passions are Ultimate Frisbee and
``Star Trek.'' ``My wife always says you'd never guess Carl went to
MIT,'' said Shapiro's colleague at UC Berkeley, Michael Katz.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro is a leading exponent of the ``post-Chicago'' school of
antitrust theory, which rejects the influential view of some
scholars at the University of Chicago that market forces alone can
protect consumer interests without antitrust remedies.
</P>
<P>
   But Shapiro is equally critical of what he calls ``mushy
populism,'' the view that ``business is suspect'' and ``big is
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro, a math whiz in college, switched to economics in
graduate school at MIT to apply his skills to the real world _
following in the footsteps of his father, who taught money and
banking at Notre Dame and the University of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro joined the faculty at Princeton University, where he met
Katz, who had been a classmate of Bill Gates at Harvard. Intrigued
by the glamour of the software industry, Katz and Shapiro began
studying how firms in that sector wield monopoly power through the
creation of standards.
</P>
<P>
   In a landmark 1985 article, Katz and Shapiro coined the term
``network effects'' to explain the rise of firms like Microsoft.
The term came from network industries like telecommunications,
where the value of telephone service depends on how many other
people are on the same network.
</P>
<P>
   The theory strongly influenced antitrust analysis in technology
markets. In its latest suit against Microsoft, the Justice
Department said the company's market power was ``magnified and
reinforced by `network effects.' ...The more users a particularly
operating system has, the more applications software developers
will write for that operating systems; and that, in turn, will make
the operating system more attractive to more users. ... These
network effects give Microsoft a tremendous advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Katz and Shapiro's analysis wasn't lost on Microsoft, either. As
Bill Gates told the Harvard Business School in 1994, ``We look for
opportunities with network (effects) _ where there are advantages
to the vast majority of consumers to share a common standard.''
</P>
<P>
   Katz and Shapiro pointed out that standards bring tremendous
rewards to consumers _ as well as to the monopolists who profit
from the standards. But other scholars warned about the power of
network effects to ``lock in'' inferior technology and retard
innovation _ a charge repeatedly thrown at Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro takes a middle road: He sees merit in many Microsoft
products but faults the company for trying to protect its hold on
the operating system market through exclusive contracts with
Internet service providers and computer makers.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro's critique of Microsoft stands in sharp contrast to his
defense of Intel, which has even an greater share of its own market
for microprocessors.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro's reasoning: Intel faces stiff competition from AMD and
National Semiconductor, resulting in rapidly falling prices for
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro notes that Intel's withholding of chip secrets from
companies such as Intergraph and Digital Equipment, although
condemned by the FTC, was aimed at protecting Intel's intellectual
property, not restricting competition. No one can find consumers
who have been harmed, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro, who charges Intel $490 an hour for advice, insists that
he doesn't switch positions just to please a paying client.
</P>
<P>
   ``I turn down about half the calls I get because I'm too busy,''
Shapiro said. ``This gives me the luxury of picking cases on two
criteria: Is the position they are likely to want something I
believe in, and is it interesting?''
</P>
<P>
   Antitrust economist and Forbes magazine columnist Peter Huber
said, ``He has an immaculate reputation. He's up there in the top
tier, for both intelligence and his reputation for working only on
things he believes in.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it's hard to find anyone who doesn't like or admire
Shapiro. But his toughest intellectual critics score points in
noting that his theoretical work offers little policy guidance as
to when antitrust authorities should step in to curb high-tech
monopolies.
</P>
<P>
   Katz and Shapiro acknowledged as much in a 1994 article, when
they conceded, ``We are far from having a general theory of when
government intervention is preferable to the unregulated market
outcome.''

 New Wells CEO Shares His Vision   By Peter Sinton  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
The wheels started to turn early this year on the Wells
Fargo-Norwest merger when the top executives of the two banks met
for breakfast.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Norwest Chief Executive Officer Richard Kovacevich has known his
Wells Fargo counterpart Paul Hazen for a decade or more and the two
met on one of Kovacevich's regular visits to meet California
investors. In the banking industry, ``everyone talks with everyone
else,'' Kovacevich said.
</P>
<P>
   Then following the recently announced mergers of
Citicorp-Travelers Group, NationsBank-BofA and Banc One-First
Chicago, Kovacevich initiated more earnest discussions with Hazen
last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went over our visions of the future and strategic
advantages,'' he said. ``Then about two weeks ago we brought in our
presidents to talk with their systems and financial people and run
some numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Refreshed by his first full night's sleep in three days,
Kovacevich commented yesterday in an interview with The Chronicle
about how the merger with Wells Fargo came about and his plans for
the merged bank.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made of the two banks' supposedly different
cultures _ that Wells is centralized and focuses more on technology
than people while Norwest is decentralized and more high-touch than
high-tech. But Kovacevich, who will move to San Francisco and
become CEO of the combined bank, disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our business models are different,'' he said in a telephone
interview. ``But I would argue that our culture and how we make
decisions is the same: You do what is best for your customers, your
stockholders, your people _ not for your ego or personal desires.''
</P>
<P>
   Complementary Styles
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that Norwest, with many more rural customers
than Wells Fargo, provides ``more face-to-face contact because that
is what the majority of our customers wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   While Norwest ``does community banking better than anyone else''
and was recently ranked most admired super-regional bank by Fortune
Magazine, Kovacevich said, ``Wells is the best in the country in
providing alternative delivery channels including online banking
and supermarket branches.'' (Wells has more than 900 such branches
compared to 40 for Norwest.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We've both perfected different business models,'' he
continued. ``They may appear to be in conflict but, in fact, they
are complementary because there are customers in both of our
markets that want both of these services.
</P>
<P>
   Kovacevich talked about ``micro-marketing'' and delivering
different services even in different parts of the same city
depending on the needs of its different customers. Norwest leaves
major marketing decisions to regional presidents serving its 16
states.
</P>
<P>
   But it remains to be seen whether that sort of decentralized
decision-making will be the way things are done at the new Wells
Fargo. But it seems likely since Kovacevich will be CEO and his
closest assistant, President Leslie Biller, also is moving to San
Francisco to be in charge of merging the various businesses.
Meanwhile, Hazen will become chairman and Wells President Rod
Jacobs will focus on integrating systems.
</P>
<P>
   Another sign that Kovacevich's philosophy may reign is that
Norwest is printing up another 30,000 copies of his ``Sharing the
vision, living the values'' for distribution to Wells employees in
the next week. Many of Norwest's 58,255 team members (as workers
are called) carry it with them as a business bible.
</P>
<P>
   No Rest for Norwest Chief
</P>
<P>
   It has been a busy few days for Kovacevich.
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday night, he grabbed a Northwest Airlines flight to
San Francisco after securing the approval of the Minneapolis-based
bank's board of directors to merge with Wells Fargo.
</P>
<P>
   About 7:30 p.m. on Sunday, after the agreement to combine
operations in 21 states to create the seventh-largest U.S. bank was
approved by BofA's directors, he, Hazen and a few other top
managers took off for New York.
</P>
<P>
   After meetings with bank analysts and a press conference at the
Plaza Hotel on Monday, Kovacevich returned to Minneapolis at
midnight. Then at 7 a.m. Tuesday he met with major investors,
including American Express Financial Advisors, and the Minnesota
media.
</P>
<P>
   In other merger related news yesterday, both Wells and Norwest
were criticized for the merger move. Two Wells Fargo shareholders
filed suit in Delaware Chancery Court to block the merger with
Norwest because they charge Wells could have gotten a higher price
if the bank had solicited other offers from U.S. Bancorp or other
potential suitors.
</P>
<P>
   Norwest offered a 9 percent premium for Wells Fargo's, based on
Norwest's closing price last Friday. But that premium has
disappeared since both Norwest and Wells Fargo shares declined on
Monday and Tuesday. Analysts don't expect the lawsuit will have
much impact on the merger being approved by shareholders and
regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Some Minnesota officials also blasted the merger, saying it
could lead to the loss of more than 800 local jobs and imperil the
Twin Cities' status as a financial center.

 Inktomi Doubles In IPO   By Jon Swartz  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Wall Street loves the Internet _ again.
<TEXT>
<P>
   After giving online stock offerings a cold shoulder for most of
last year, investors are giving a warm reception to this year's
crop of Internet initial public offerings. Yesterday, investors
furiously snapped up Inktomi Corp. shares in the company's first
day of public trading.
</P>
<P>
   Inktomi develops search-engine technology and software to police
Web traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The San Mateo startup's stock doubled to $36 in brisk trading,
fueling a market value of $739.15 million and making instant
millionaires of its co-founders, Eric Brewer, 31, and Paul
Gauthier, 25.
</P>
<P>
   When the pair started Inktomi in 1996, Brewer was a professor of
computer science at the University of California at Berkeley and
Gauthier was a graduate student in the same department.
</P>
<P>
   Inktomi originally had expected sales of its 2.25 million shares
to debut at $12 to $14 per share, but its lead underwriter Goldman
Sachs &AMP; Co. raised that range to $16 to $18 on Tuesday amid a
ravenous rush on Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recent stock run-ups of search-engine companies indicate a
new wave of successful Internet IPOs,'' said William Marbach,
managing editor of Venture Finance, a New York newsletter that
covers the high-tech IPO market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing the opposite effect from a year ago, when the
struggling stocks of Yahoo, Excite and others put a damper on
potential stock offerings,'' Marbach said.
</P>
<P>
   The recent upturn in Internet-related stocks has created a
more-favorable climate for Internet IPOs and was a significant
factor behind the successful stock offerings this year of VeriSign,
a Mountain View-based e-commerce company; CDnow, an online seller
of compact discs and videos; and DoubleClick, an
Internet-advertising specialist in Palo Alto.
</P>
<P>
   Inktomi (a Lakota Indian word meaning ``wit and cunning'') is
best known for supplying technology to Wired Digital that was used
to create the HotBot search engine.
</P>
<P>
   But it became a hot IPO candidate after signing several similar
deals with other high-profile Internet players.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo recently picked Inktomi to replace Alta Vista as the
search engine underlying its navigational guide. Inktomi software
powers Cnet's Snap!, the search service in which NBC bought a 19
percent stake Tuesday _ with an option to buy 60 percent for $38
million. (NBC also bought 5 percent of Cnet for $26 million.)
</P>
<P>
   And Inktomi has an agreement to provide search-engine technology
for Microsoft Corp.'s forthcoming ``Start.com'' super site.
</P>
<P>
   Inktomi also makes Traffic Server software that helps Internet
service providers and telecommunications companies bypass online
gridlock. The product relies on network-caching technology, which
lets Web browsers store the most frequently viewed pages, images
and sounds in temporary files that are easily accessible from a
desktop computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a hot stock that everyone has been closely watching,''
said Jim Breyer, managing partner at Palo Alto venture capital firm
Accel Partners. ``Inktomi benefitted tremendously from the NBC-Cnet
deal, which further verifies Internet stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Breyer cautioned that investors should not expect the
next round of Internet IPOs to match the success of Inktomi.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question at the end of the day is whether some of these
stocks are overvalued,'' he said. ``Many of them will have wild
rides over the next 12 months. We heard this in 1996, and it still
applies today: This is not a market for the mild mannered.''

RESEARCHER WARNS OF FUTURE EFFECTS OF FAT SUBSTITUTE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Ore.)  (ja) 
 By MARIAN BURROS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One of the leading researchers in the field of
nutrition and degenerative diseases said Wednesday that long-term
use of a new fat substitute, already available nationwide in potato
chips, may cause thousands of additional cases of cancer and heart
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Walter Willett, the chairman of the nutrition department at
the Harvard School of Public Health, said it would be better if
there were none of the fat substitute, olestra, in the food supply
but if it is permitted it should carry a warning about potential
long-term hazards. He made his comments at a news conference held
by the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nutrition
advocacy group that has campaigned against olestra, and conducts
regular studies on food and nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble, which sells olestra under the brand name
Olean, and the Food and Drug Administration, which approved the fat
substitute 2 1/2 years ago, disagree with Willett's conclusions and
say that olestra is safe, though they acknowledge the possibility
of short-term problems for some people. That is why all products
containing olestra must carry a label warning that ``olestra may
cause abdominal cramping and loose stools.'' There have been
thousands of reported complaints about these short-term effects.
</P>
<P>
   WOW potato chips, made by Frito-Lay, the first product in
nationwide distribution to contain olestra, have been on the market
since March.
</P>
<P>
   Next week an FDA advisory committee will decide whether to
permit olestra to stay on the market, and it appears that there
will be no change in its status.
</P>
<P>
   Willett said that the approval of olestra is forcing the public
to ``participate in a massive and uncontrolled experiment without
their informed consent.'' He based his claim on olestra's
interference with the absorption of fat-soluble nutrients, both
vitamins and carotenoids. Carotenoids are what make fruits and
vegetables red, yellow or orange.
</P>
<P>
   When the FDA approved the use of the olestra in 1995 it required
that the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E and K be added to foods
containing olestra, but it did not require the addition of the
carotenoids, because there was insufficient proof that they were
protective against any diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Department of Health and Human Services, the
National Cancer Institute and the World Cancer Research Fund have
recognized carotenoids' likely benefits. ``Dietary Guidelines for
Americans,'' published by the Department of Health and Human
Services, cites their ``potentially beneficial role in reducing the
risk for cancer and certain other chronic diseases.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the evidence comes from large human studies that
associate low intakes or blood levels of these nutrients with
higher risk of certain cancers _ including lung, prostate, breast
and colon _ as well as higher risk of heart disease and stroke and
macular degeneration, the most common cause of blindness in the
elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Willett and 13 colleagues from other research institutions have
sent a letter to the FDA acknowledging that ``carotenoids have not
been proven with certainty to provide human health benefits, but
numerous biochemical, clinical and epidemiologic studies indicate
that carotenoids are likely to protect against several cancers.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the signers, Dr. William Connor, professor of medicine
and clinical nutrition at Oregon Health Sciences University in
Portland said, ``Before putting olestra into food it must be proven
completely safe because we clearly don't need it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Procter &AMP; Gamble says olestra is helpful in reducing caloric
and fat intake.
</P>
<P>
   Concerning carotenoids, Procter &AMP; Gamble's own studies found
that a 1-ounce package of potato chips made with olestra will
reduce their level in the blood by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If olestra sells as well as Procter &AMP; Gamble hopes, Willett and
his Harvard colleague, Dr. Meir Stampfer, believe that the average
carotenoid levels in the population would be reduced by about 10
percent. Based on these assumptions Willett said they estimate an
additional 2,000 to 9,800 cases of prostate cancer, 32,000
additional cases of coronary heart disease, 1,400 to 7,400 excess
cases of lung cancer and 80 to 390 more cases of macular
degeneration.
</P>
<P>
   Willett stressed that ``there is no proof that these excess
cases will occur.'' But, he added, ``These estimates indicate the
size of the gamble that Procter &AMP; Gamble is willing to take with
your health and mine.''
</P>
<P>
   It appears that the Food and Drug Administration does not agree
with Willett's conclusions. Dr. Alan Rulis, director of the office
of premarket approval in the Center for Food Safety and Applied
Nutrition, said, ``I don't want to prejudge the issue. It is far
from settled, but we have not seen real documented consensus
agreement about the benefits of carotenoids. The regulatory status
of olestra will be status quo.'' &QL;

   After several days of intense and sometimes acrimonious
negotiations, St. John's appeared on the verge of reaching
agreement with Mike Jarvis, its No. 1 choice to be the new head
basketball coach, despite several sticking points that remained to
be worked out. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The representative for Jarvis, Robert Ades, left New York
Wednesday and headed back to Washington, D.C., where Jarvis is the
coach for George Washington University. And while Ades expressed
annoyance at St. Johns' negotiating stance, it was not expected to
scuttle a deal that would bring Jarvis to the Big East school.
</P>
<P>
   Some contract matters still had to be worked out, and language
that would govern the new coach's behavior had become an issue, as
well as a desire by the university to ensure that Jarvis would not
soon depart for another college job or the National Basketball
Association. Still, officials at St. John's and George Washington
maintained Wednesday night that Jarvis is eager to accept the job
and that St. John's is equally eager to have him.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's officials termed the problems as not being
deal-breakers, and that an announcement could come as early as
Thursday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to an associate of Jarvis, the two sides agreed on
money, believed to be in excess of $800,000 per year for a
seven-year contract. Jarvis would replace Fran Fraschilla, who was
dismissed last month.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview before he left for Washington, Ades
said he was insulted and irritated by what he felt were
unreasonable demands on the part of the university. St. John's,
embarrassed by the problems involved in the dismissal of
Fraschilla, has wanted a behavior clause in the contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been embarrassed before,'' Ades said, referring to
the school's problems with Fraschilla this year, as well as the
circus-like search for a coach two years ago in which Fraschilla
got the job only after other, more prominent coaches rejected it.
``They want to make sure that it does not happen again. But that is
why you hire Mike Jarvis.''
</P>
<P>
   He credited St. John's attorney, Ray McGuire, with keeping the
negotiations on track.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray McGuire, is one of the classiest, most knowledgeable
attorneys that there is in the field of labor relations today,''
Ades said. ``He is trying to drag St. John's into the '90s world of
the business of college athletics kicking and screaming. If this
deal gets done, it will only be because of him.''
</P>
<P>
   University officials would not comment publically on the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   But while hurt feelings kept the happy faces on hold at St.
John's, the school still wants Jarvis and Jarvis wants the job, so
the two sides expect to plow forward. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was not money that stood in the way as negotiations came to a
halt Wednesday afternoon. St. John's, which was offended by
Fraschilla's flirtations with Arizona State University, wanted
assurances of Jarvis' behavior and his loyalty to the program.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis, who has spent eight years at George Washington
University after five years at Boston University, has never had a
losing season on the court and has an unblemished record off of it.
But St. John's may be wary about his willingness to speak to other
schools about their coaching vacancies; he did so this year with
the University of Michigan and University of Virginia, and last
year with Boston College.
</P>
<P>
   But officials on each side of the negotiations believe the deal
will get done because Jarvis wants it to. People close to Jarvis
say he believes he has gone as far as he can at George Washington
and has a chance to contend for a national title at St. John's. In
addition, New York would provide a high-profile stage.
</P>
<P>
   Ades admitted that he advised Tim Welsh to spurn Providence's
offer to him, but Welsh took the job anyway, and that it was his
job only to advise and the decision would be Jarvis'. ``It's just
sad that this is where we're at,'' Ades said. ``We all sat down and
all wanted the same thing. Whether it happens, I don't know.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   St. John's flirtations with Jarvis actually began two years ago
when he conducted preliminary discussions with Manetta for the job
that eventually went to Fraschilla. But at that time,

REACTION TO HORRIBLE CRIME: SADNESS, SHOCK, SILENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CAROL MARIE CROPPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ The courthouse square in this East Texas town
seemed almost eerily quiet on this sweltering day. Few people
milled about and those who did seemed hesitant to talk to outsiders
Wednesday about the horrible crime that had brought a swarm of TV
trucks to the town and would bring the Rev. Jesse Jackson on
Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Lou Ann Reed, a cashier at the Quik Mart at the edge of town,
said few talked of the brutal slaying of James Byrd Jr., a black
man dragged to death behind a pickup truck Sunday, and the three
local white men who have been charged with the murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad situation,'' said Ms. Reed, who is white. ``I don't
think anybody should be treated that way, I don't care what color
they are. Not even an animal.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she had heard there might be whites in her town who, as
is suspected of the men charged, sympathized with white supremacist
groups, she only looked down. Asked if the killing surprised her,
she said, ``Nothing surprises me anymore,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Charged with murder are Lawrence Russell Brewer, 31, of Sulphur
Springs, and Shawn Allen Berry and John William King, both 23 of
Jasper. The three were held without bond in the Jasper County Jail,
and the local prosecutors said Wednesday that would try to seek the
death penalty against them.
</P>
<P>
   King's father, Ronald King, also a resident of Jaspar, released
a hand-written letter apologizing for his son's actions. He started
it by writing, ``My sympathy goes out to the Byrd family. There is
no reason for a person to take the life of another, and to take it
in such a manner is beyond any kind of reasoning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts me deeply to know that a boy I raised and considered
to be the most loved boy I knew could find it in himself to take a
life,'' the elder King said. ``This deed cannot be undone, but I
hope we can all find it our hearts to go forward in peace and with
love for all. Let us find in our hears love for our fellow man.
Hate can only destroy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Again, I want to say I'm sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Clinton called the killing of Byrd
shocking and outrageous. He said the residents here ``must join
together across racial lines to demonstrate that an act of evil
like this is not what this country is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   The president continued, ``I think we've all been touched by it,
and I can only imagine that virtually everyone who lives there is
in agony at this moment.''
</P>
<P>
   At the town's beautiful old courthouse, built in 1889, with a
white gazebo in front, Neva Alexander, the administrative assistant
to the county judge, said there had been a lot of talk among the
8,000 residents in the East Texas town, with its hills and lush
vegetation looks more like the South than the parched, flat plains
found elsewhere in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody thinks it's horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   But, she added, she thinks it was an isolated act of violence.
Agreeing with her was a city councilman from Vidor, another East
Texas town that drew headlines several years when the Ku Klux Klan
rallied against the integration of the town's housing projects, who
was in Jasper on business. The councilman, David Slaughter,
defended his town from the news reports that have brought up what
happened there when talking about the killing in Jasper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the next thing, we'll have something happen in El Paso
and someone will stand before a camera and say, `I'm here reporting
live from El Paso, 850 miles from Vidor.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Vidor, Jasper is a town without widespread racial problems,
Slaughter said. ``You can not stereotype a city or a county or a
community because of the actions of some people.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the whites, as well as some blacks, seemed to believe
the crime did not reflect a deeper problem.
</P>
<P>
   But at an afternoon prayer meeting, held at the church the dead
man's family attend and featuring Rev. Jesse Jackson as a speaker,
blacks were less certain the murder was an isolated incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``It done uncovered a lot of things that should have been
uncovered before,'' said Herbert Spikes, a 58-year-old Wal-Mart
employee in Jasper. ``Maybe it took this to bring it out. I believe
it will get better now that it's exposed.''
</P>
<P>
   Truman Boatner, 48, told how he and some black friends were
attacked about 14 years ago when they went to swim at one of the
lakes that dot the area and lure champion bass fishermen. ``I don't
go up there no more,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Greater New Bethel Baptist Church, Jackson arrived to
a standing ovation after he first paid a brief visit on Byrd's
family. Jackson said he had talked with President Clinton. He said
he had also talked with U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno, who told
him she had dispatched civil rights officials to Jasper.
</P>
<P>
   Even basketball star Dennis Rodman, originally from Texas, had
gotten involved, Jackson said, offering to pay the costs of Byrd's
funeral, which Jackson promised to attend Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time like this, we are breathless,'' he told the crowd of
about 250 squeezed into the country church, with perhaps another
200 sweating in 93-degree heat outside. ``We can't quite explain it
or understand it. We are hurt.''

   CHANGE AT RAINBOW ROOM
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The family that owns Harry Cipriani, the restaurant
in the Sherry-Netherland Hotel on Fifth Avenue, will take over the
Rainbow Room on Jan. 1, the company that manages Rockefeller Center
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The future of the Rainbow Room, the famous Art Moderne
restaurant on the 65th floor of 30 Rockefeller Plaza, became the
subject of intense speculation about who would be named to run the
restaurant after the landlord, Tishman Speyer Properties, decided
last year that it could bring in more revenue if it had a trendier
image.
</P>
<P>
   Guiseppe Cipriani, the chairman of Cipriani Holding Group, said
his company would pay about $4 million in annual rent for the
restaurant under the terms of the 15-year lease, which was signed
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel thrilled,'' Cipriani said. ``It's an American landmark,
and I think we can do a great job there.''
</P>
<P>
   Cipriani said that plans for the restaurant, which may include
expanding into space on the 67th floor that is currently being used
for storage, had been discussed in only general terms and that the
details would be worked out over the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   He said he expected the restaurant to shut down for one month in
January while the kitchen is renovated.
</P>
<P>
   At the Rainbow Room, the Ciprianis will replace Joseph Baum, a
veteran restaurateur, and his partner, David Emil, who have run the
Rainbow Room since 1985, after spending $20 million to renovate it.
Since then, the restaurant's gross income has grown from $8 million
to $32 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a wonderful time operating the Rainbow Room,'' Emil
said, ``and we wish them the best.''

   INSIGNIA TO BUY COMPANY
</P>
<P>
   Insignia Financial Group announced Wednesday that its commercial
real estate services unit, Insignia/ESG, had agreed to acquire the
commercial real estate businesses of Jackson-Cross Co., one of the
country's oldest commercial real estate services firms and the
market leader in the greater Philadelphia region.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase price was not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Insignia Financial Group is the largest manager of multifamily
residential properties in the United States, with a nationwide
portfolio of about 275,000 units, including approximately 59,000
condominium and cooperative units in the New York metropolitan
area.
</P>
<P>
   The company has acquired nine other full-service commercial real
estate firms in the last 16 months. It also owns Realty One of
Cleveland, Ohio, a brokerage company.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson-Cross traces its roots back more than 120 years and has
been responsible for some of the largest real estate transactions
in the Philadelphia region in recent years, including 1.25 million
square feet for Cigna Corp. in Philadelphia and 675,000 square feet
for the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transit Authority in
Philadelphia. &QL;

STAYING IN MANHATTAN: EXPENSIVE PROPOSITION 
</HEADLINE>
 NY-HOTEL-PRICES-580&AMP;ADD-NYT (EDS: This article is part of TIMES EXPRESS. It is a condensed
version of a story that will appear in tomorrow's New York Times.)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Looking for a hotel room in Manhattan? You have
plenty of options. You could book weeks in advance and pay $300 or
so a night for a room at a modern midtown high-rise like the Crowne
Plaza. If you're willing to pay a bit more _ say, $500 a night on
average _ you could probably get something with less of a hassle at
the Four Seasons or the Pierre. Or you could do what a growing
number of visitors are forced to do: stay in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel market in Manhattan, the most expensive in the nation
and fresh off a record year in 1997, continued to tighten in the
first quarter of 1998, with the average cost of a night's stay
creeping closer to $200.
</P>
<P>
   The market has become so expensive that in the past 18 months
five hotels _ the Lowell, the St. Regis and the Carlyle, as well as
the Pierre and the Four Seasons _ began charging an average rate of
$500. No other city in the nation has even a single hotel with an
average rate so high, industry experts said.
</P>
<P>
   And even as prices rise, it is still difficult to find a room in
New York unless it is booked far in advance. That fact has forced
some visitors to stay in New Jersey or bypass the city altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot find a decent hotel room anywhere on Manhattan, it
seems, for less than a fortune,'' said Alan Bennett of Sydney,
Australia, who was planning to come to the city in August. ``We
have searched data base after data base and rung hotel chains'
reservations centers, all to no avail.''
</P>
<P>
   The average price of a room in Manhattan rose to $189.70 for the
first quarter of the year, according to preliminary figures from
the Coopers &AMP; Lybrand Lodging Research Network. That's a 13.9
percent leap over the $166.58 average room price for the first
quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Occupancy rates are nearing records, too. For the first three
months of the year, which are among the slowest for the industry in
New York, hotels were 80.5 percent filled, according to Coopers &AMP;
Lybrand.

SWISS-AMERICAN GROUP BUYS A TOP BRAZILIAN BANK
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Credit Suisse First Boston has bought Brazil's
leading investment bank, making the Swiss-American group the
largest underwriter and stock trader in that hotly competitive
emerging market, the companies announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of First Boston, Credit Suisse's investment banking
unit, said the $675 million cash-and-stock purchase of Garantia SA,
a private partnership, makes them by far the biggest investment
bank in Brazil, Latin America's largest economy.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition intensifies the race for Latin American
dominance among investment banks, which have cut fees hard in an
effort to secure a steady flow of deals from Brazil and other
countries in the region. Merrill Lynch, the American investment
bank, earlier this week won a mandate to underwrite the $6 billion
privatization of Brazil's national oil company, but accepted fees
of just 0.45 percent of the total transaction, a new low in that
market.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Hester, Credit Suisse First Boston's chief financial
officer, said banks were ``cutting their throats'' to win top
underwriting assignments in Latin America. ``When you consider all
the man-hours poured into some deals, there is very little money to
be made,'' he said in an interview Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Hester said, First Boston's move to become a
dominant competitor in Brazil will allow it to profit from smaller
but more lucrative deals. For example, many of the major
privatization deals, like the one to bring the oil company
Petrobras to market, produce limited returns but help broaden the
market for banks that stay behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``By taking a deep leadership position, we can be more
successful and profitable there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In emerging markets, many banks tend to focus solely on the
biggest cross-border underwriting assignments, or stocks that
foreign investors might want to buy, said Raphael Soifer,
securities-company analyst with Brown Brothers Harriman. ``But
Brazil is proving itself to be a big market, and it makes sense to
build up your local presence there as well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Garantia put itself up for auction after it suffered $100
million in trading losses late last year, losses that were
associated with the Asian financial crisis. The sale attracted many
of the world's top investment banks, including Goldman, Sachs and
Morgan Stanley, both of which held talks with Garantia, officials
of the Brazilian bank told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase of Garantia is part of the Credit Suisse Group's
effort to expand its presence in all areas of investment and
commercial banking and insurance. It paid $10 billion last year to
buy Winterthur Insurance Co. of Switzerland. First Boston snapped
up some Asian and European operations of BZW, a British-based
investment bank, from Barclays.
</P>
<P>
   Like all investment banks, First Boston has sought to expand its
presence in Latin America, Hester said. But the bank found that it
was ``unlikely to get ahead'' of rivals like Merrill Lynch,
Goldman, Sachs and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter if it continued to
rely on internal growth instead of acquisitions, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Garantia, of Sao Paulo, was founded in 1971 by Jorge Paulo
Lemann, a Harvard-educated former tennis star. It has 320
employees, assets of $5 billion and a top-three share of Brazil's
equity and debt issuance and mergers and acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of Credit Suisse's deal, it will pay Garantia's
managing partners $200 million in cash and $475 million in stock
over three years, but could pay more if Garantia employees meet
profit goals. The purchase price amounts to 1.68 times Garantia's
book value.

COMPLAINTS AGAINST NEW YORK POLICE RISE
</HEADLINE>
   (dc) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Civilian complaints against New York City police
officers went up by 20 percent during the first five months of the
year, according to statistics released Wednesday by the Civilian
Complaint Review Board.
</P>
<P>
   The review board _ the independent agency that monitors and
investigates accusations of police misconduct _ logged 2,176
complaints against police officers from January through May. During
the same period last year, the board reported 1,818 complaints,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when the review board reported a 21 percent decrease
in civilian complaints during the first five months of the year,
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Police Commissioner Howard Safir and Mel
Barkan, the chairman of the review board, held a news conference to
trumpet the figures. This year, the figures showing an increase in
complaints were released without fanfare at the board's monthly
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's troubling,'' said Norman Siegel, the executive director
of the New York Civil Liberties Union. ``For most of 1997, we heard
glowing reports from the Giuliani administration about how the
numbers from the CCRB were decreasing. But now that complaints are
going up, we don't hear anything. I guess it is what you call
selective commentary. It makes it clear that they were using the
numbers last year for political purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the figures at his weekly news conference, Safir
said that the number of complaints had been higher since the Abner
Louima case brought increased attention to the issue of police
brutality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always concerned about increases in civilian complaints,''
Safir said. ``My view is that we work very hard to reduce them.''

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SAYS WHEAT MUST BE INCLUDED IN SANCTIONS

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Washington wheat growers are bracing for the loss
of their most important market after the Justice Department
recommended Wednesday that Pakistan be prevented from buying
Northwest wheat as punishment for testing nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash, said that National Security Adviser
Sandy Berger, U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky and
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman all told her Wednesday that the
agricultural credits Pakistan uses to buy American wheat must be
prohibited under the sanctions the U.S. is required to impose on
the South Asian nation.
</P>
<P>
   Berger told Murray that only a change in U.S. law would save the
Pakistani market for Northwest wheat growers, the senator said.

   Several members of the Washington state congressional delegation
are attempting to change the law to aid the wheat farmers. A House
committee Wednesday approved a measure sponsored by Rep. George
Nethercutt, R-Wash., to cancel the portion of the sanctions that
affects agricultural commodity credit programs. Murray and Sen.
Slade Gorton, R-Wash., plan to introduce similar measures in a
Senate committee Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is of critical importance to the wheat industry, which
ranks second only to airplanes in its size as an export commodity
from Washington state. The Pakistani market for Northwest wheat is
about $250 million per year.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past several years Pakistan has imported as much as 37
percent of the wheat grown in Washington state. The loss of the
market promises to devastate an industry already reeling from
record-low prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our wheat farmers are really hurting this year, with wheat
prices extremely low because of the Asian currency problem,''
Murray said. ``If we lose this market, that is more than one-third
of our wheat we won't have a market for. Eastern Washington farmers
should not be bearing the brunt of this nation's sanctions against
Pakistan.''
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the State Department and Justice Department
insisted that no final decision has been made on whether the
sanctions against Pakistan will include the agricultural credit
program Pakistan uses to buy American wheat. But Murray, Gorton and
Nethercutt all said they received calls from the Justice Department
informing them that lawyers there believe the U.S. sanctions law
clearly covers those credits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Department of Justice has concluded that the sanctions do
apply to agriculture,'' said Nethercutt, whose district includes
southeast Washington where wheat farmers are concentrated. But
Nethercutt said he is still hopeful that someone in the Clinton
administration will override the Justice Department, saying ``they
have some discretion ... and it's still fluid.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorton called on the Clinton administration to publicly announce
the details of its sanctions, but said ``It's very possible that
these sanctions will have a devastating impact on Washington's
wheat industry.'' He said the sanctions are a failure, because they
did not deter Pakistan and India from testing nuclear weapons, and
now, ``Instead of deterring nuclear testing, these unilateral
sanctions will only succeed in hurting U.S. workers, farmers, and
families _ and most notably our Washington state wheat growers.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a 1994 law, never before implemented. It requires
the imposition of broad sanctions against nations that test nuclear
weapons. Last month, India and Pakistan each conducted tests.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions affect development assistance; military sales and
exchanges; trade in specified technology; U.S. financial
assistance, guarantees, and credits; and loans and credits by U.S.
banks.
</P>
<P>
   Food products are exempt from the sanctions, but credits are
not. That left open the question of whether credits used to buy
food might be affected. The Justice Department's interpretation
Wednesday was that they must be included in the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Congress changes the law on sanctions, Pakistan may be
so poor or so angry that it will choose not to purchase U.S. wheat,
most of which comes from the Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``While our wheat growers stand at risk of losing this vital
market, their counterparts in Canada, Europe and Australia are
celebrating the shortsightedness of the U.S. administration,''
Gorton said. ``They are happy to step in and fill the place of
American exporters in Pakistan. The Pakistani government and people
will turn to nations that are not criticizing their actions and
their imports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Airbus and Canadian or Australian grain farmers will benefit
from U.S. actions, while Boeing and our wheat growers will be left
out in the cold.''
</P>
<P>
   Making matters even worse, the wheat farmers face the prospect
of Australia, their chief competitor in Pakistan, taking advantage
of the U.S. departure from the Pakistani market to raise prices
there and then lower them elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Australia will have a market given to them by means of our
sanctions, and then they can charge a little higher price, take the
profit, and use it to lower the price against us where we go head
to head,'' said Thomas Mick, chief executive officer of the
Washington Wheat Commission. ``We're very disappointed, and we
really don't know what our next plan of action is going to be.''

GIULIANI CUTS $196 MILLION FROM NYC BUDGET; VALLONE FOWS FIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAN BARRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Wielding a rarely used power of his office, Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani vetoed more than $196 million from the city budget
Wednesday, asserting that the money _ from $727 for the Staten
Island Historical Society to $10 million for legal aid _
represented the reckless spending of a City Council confused in a
season of budget surplus and political ambition.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the appearances of being extreme measures in a tense
budget dispute, the vetoes are largely symbolic, as Council leaders
were quick to point out. Council Speaker Peter Vallone said that
the Council will vote soon, probably as early as Thursday, to
restore the mayor's cuts by easily overriding his vetoes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the vetoes had aides on both sides of City Hall
frantically putting the mayor's actions in self-serving context.
The mayor was portrayed as the fiscally prudent leader guarding
against Democratic profligacy, while the speaker became the friend
to the poor and forgotten, striking back against the Snidely
Whiplash of Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Peter Vallone looks at himself in the mirror, he should
see that the budget he has had the Council pass takes us back to
the huge deficits of the past, when we should be holding the line
on spending,'' said Randy Mastro, the deputy mayor for operations.
</P>
<P>
   To which Vallone responded: ``The next time I see a working
mother rushing home from work to pick up her child, a college
student working three jobs to pay his tuition or a child suffering
from severe asthma, I will remember that these are the people Mayor
Giuliani is cutting funding from.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Such are the taunts of a fight that centers on the $34 billion
budget that the Council passed unilaterally last week. This act of
defiant independence marked the first time since the City Charter
was revised in 1989 that city leaders had not adopted a budget in
consensus.
</P>
<P>
   Council leaders say the dispute centers on the the mayor's
insistence that the speaker drop his call for a referendum on
whether the city should finance a stadium in Manhattan for the
Bronx-based New York Yankees. The mayor's aides say that dueling
tax cut proposals also figured in the fight.
</P>
<P>
   One of the options available to the mayor after the Council's
act of boldness is to use his line-item veto power to slash any
additional spending that the Council tacked on to the executive
budget he proposed in late April.
</P>
<P>
   And he exercised that option with a vengeance Wednesday, cutting
$196 million from $233 million in additional Council spending, and
$315 million more from the $345 million that the Council added to
city's $5 billion capital budget.
</P>
<P>
   He cut $18 million from the Administration for Children
Services, including money for day-care programs, on the ground that
the budget already provided sufficient financing _ the same reason
he gave for cutting $1 million for a summer youth program.
</P>
<P>
   He cut $7.3 million from the Board of Education because, he
said, the programs it would finance and the supplies it would buy,
including maps and furniture, would be covered by the board's $250
million surplus.
</P>
<P>
   He cut $6.6 million set aside for various nonprofit
organizations: $718,000 for the Women's Prison Association; $2
million for the Neighborhood Defender Service; $116,500 from the
Gay and Lesbian Anti-Violence Program. The stated reason for all
was the same: ``The Executive Budget maintains adequate funding for
this type of service. The City Council's addition is an unwarranted
increase which does not include sufficient justification.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's aides argued that the Council seemed at times to be
using city money to finance the kind of grandiose gestures that
come with a $2 billion surplus. City Budget Director Joseph Lhota
said the Council set aside $10 million for the Legal Aid Society _
even though, he said, the society's representatives asked the
Council for only $6 million while appearing before a Council
finance committee earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Legal Aid Society disputed that contention
Wednesday, and supplied a copy of written testimony in which Daniel
Greenberg, the organization's executive director, told a Council
committee in May: ``We therefore reiterate our need for at least
$10 million from the City Council for our criminal defense
division.''
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Bath, the organization's spokeswoman, said, ``I'm very
confused that the mayor's office is saying we didn't want the
money.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's aides also said Giuliani sought to trim the fat from
what Mastro called ``Peter's pork.'' The phrase refers to Vallone,
whose gubernatorial candidacy has been cited by the mayor's office
as the primary reason for the Council's largess.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the mayor went after anything that smacked of being a
``member item,'' which is money earmarked to meet the individual
needs of Council members. The term is so politically charged that
the Council now prefers the phrase ``local initiative.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's probably the biggest theme that runs through the
budget: we've vetoed all of the member items,'' Giuliani said.
``There are many things in this budget that are disguised as
programmatic expenses that are really member items for a particular
member to have something for himself or herself for a political
reason.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, he cut $5.5 million from various programs in
hospitals around the city _ from $1 million for a ``breast cancer
initiative'' to $250,000 for an ``asthma outreach'' contract with
the Caribbean Women's Health Association at Kings Hospital in
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The explanation for each cut was the same: ``This appears to be
a member item for which insufficient justification is provided.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani still managed to surprise Council members with his veto
choices. For example, he did not challenge the Council's decision
to restore some $15 million that he previously cut for the city's
libraries, although he did veto $7 million in enhancements _ which
the mayor said ``look to me like member items'' _ that the Council
had added to the library budget.

   TRAHAN, BURDEN GETS MARYLAND ACCOUNT
</P>
<P>
   The Maryland Department of Business and Economic Development
said Wednesday that it had named Trahan, Burden &AMP; Charles to
promote Maryland tourism as well as Maryland as a business
location. The five-year contract, with total billings estimated at
$35 million, had been handled by the Baltimore office of W.B. Doner
&AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Thomas, a spokeswoman for the department in Baltimore,
said the decision came after a three-month mandated review that had
been narrowed to Trahan, Burden and two other finalists in
Baltimore: Campbell Group and Gray Kirk/Van Sant.

   ADVERTISERS SHIFT COMPENSATION METHOD
</P>
<P>
   A majority of American advertisers have shifted from

method, according to a study conducted by the Association of
National Advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   The study, published as part of the 11th edition of the
association's survey, ``Trends in Agency Compensation,'' was based
on responses of 113 member companies. It showed that use of
billings-based commissions, both fixed rate and sliding scale,
declined from 61 percent in 1994 to 35 percent in 1997. Paying
agencies by what is known as labor-based compensation grew from 35
percent in 1994 to 53 percent in 1997. &QL;

JUROR EXPLAINS TORTUOUS PATH TO VOTING FOR DEATH SENTENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There had been three days of arguing and occasional
shouting, three days in which the 12 jurors in the Brooklyn murder
trial of Darrel Harris had agonized over the death penalty. By
Friday, 10 jurors wanted a death sentence. Eleanore Walker, a
registered nurse, was one of two who did not.
</P>
<P>
   Even as other jurors vacillated, Ms. Walker said in interviews
this week, her opinion did not sway until the close of
deliberations Friday. The arguments had grown so fierce, she said,
that several jurors complained of headaches. One woman's lips began
to swell. To ease the tension, Ms. Walker asked for a moment of
meditation. And in the silence, she said, she felt a stirring
within herself that she believed was God granting her a
``peacefulness,'' if not an answer.
</P>
<P>
   She found the answer the following morning. When she awoke
Saturday, Ms. Walker said, she opened her Bible and came to the
Book of Galatians. ``It said something about how the wicked must be
destroyed,'' she recalled. ``Everything I read pointed to
wickedness, destruction, reaping and repenting. I took it as a
strong sign of what my decision should be. ``It helped me.''
</P>
<P>
   Hours later Saturday, the fourth and final day of deliberation,
Ms. Walker became the last person to change her vote, and the jury
of seven women and five men unanimously sentenced Harris to death
for the slayings of three people during the 1996 robbery of a
Brooklyn social club. If his sentence is upheld on appeal, Harris,
40, could become the first person executed in New York state since
1963.
</P>
<P>
   Through interviews with Ms. Walker _ who had avoided contact
with the press since the trial ended _ and with another female
juror, a West Indian immigrant who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, a picture of the jury deliberations emerged: Four days
of anguish, of fierce arguments and finger pointing, and more than
20 votes until, finally, a decision was reached. They sat around a
long rectangular table in a jury room of the state Supreme Court
Building in Brooklyn, sometimes crying, sometimes shouting. ``We
felt the weight of just the word `death,''' Ms. Walker said.
Perhaps, the two jurors said, their decision might have been
different had Harris testified during the sentencing phase.
Perhaps, they agreed, the defense erred by calling Harris' mother
instead. She seemed honest and sympathetic, they said, not someone
that defense lawyers had described as abusive toward her son.
</P>
<P>
   That Ms. Walker, who cast the critical final vote, traced her
change of heart to a religious epiphany is not unusual, experts
say. William Bowers, who heads the Capital Jury Project, which
since 1991 has interviewed 1,000 death penalty jurors in 15 states,
said that jurors burdened by their responsibility will on occasion
invoke what they perceive to be the will of God.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's mostly that it relieves them of a measure of personal
responsibility for the decision,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The sentencing deliberations began Wednesday, June 3. The jury
could choose between death or life without the possibility of
parole. Crime scene photographs documented the brutal nature of the
Dec. 7, 1996, slayings at Club Happiness in Bedford-Stuyvesant,
Brooklyn: Harris had shot two men in the back of the head, and when
he ran out of bullets, he stabbed a woman, Evelyn Davis, in the
back as she pleaded for mercy and cried, ``I have five babies.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the first votes revealed a divided jury. Ms. Walker said
she and four others voted for life without parole; five voted for
death, and two remained undecided. She said the jury repeatedly
weighed the aggravating factors of the slayings versus the
mitigating factors presented by defense lawyers _ that Harris had
``snapped'' mentally, that he had been beaten as a child and that
he was addicted to drugs and alcohol. To show good character,
defense lawyers cited a 1986 incident in which Harris, a guard at a
Brooklyn jail, saved the life of another guard during an inmate
uprising.
</P>
<P>
   But one by one, the jurors began eliminating the mitigating
factors. Listening to the testimony of Harris' mother, Ms. Walker
and the other juror discounted defense efforts to portray him as an
abused child. ``I am from the West Indies,'' said the other juror.
``I was disciplined as a child, and it didn't affect me. She just
disciplined her children because, as she said, she wanted them to
do better than her.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Ms. Walker and the other juror said those holding out for
life argued that Harris might find spiritual redemption and rebirth
in prison. But both also were frustrated that he did not testify
during sentencing. ``I wanted to hear at least, `I'm sorry that it
happened,''' Ms. Walker said. ``Something that showed some
remorse.''
</P>
<P>
   The second juror said she and others noticed that Harris often
smiled during the trial. ``Several times we saw him laugh at
people, and we didn't know what that laugh meant,'' she said.
``Whether he was glorifying in what he did.''
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday, the vote had shifted to 10-to-2 in favor of death,
Ms. Walker said. As many as seven votes were taken each day, she
said, and she described deliberations as heated. ``People cried,
people got upset,'' she said. ``Yelling, like getting up and
pointing. There was no fighting, but there was, like, posturing.''
</P>
<P>
   She said one juror shouted, ``You can't tell me how to think,
because this is what is deep in my heart!'' Another told her peers,
``How would you feel if this was done to someone you know?''
</P>
<P>
   The second juror, who confirmed Ms. Walker's version of events,
said she changed her vote to death on Thursday, but not before she
weighed a personal factor. ``It was a black man, and I'm a black
person, and for selfish reasons I had thoughts about that,'' the
second juror said. Finally, though, she chose death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever he did,'' she said, ``he did it mercilessly.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Walker, meanwhile, said she shifted to undecided Friday
night after the moment of meditation. After reading the Bible on
Saturday morning, she said she decided for death. She said she felt
a sense of peace as she ate breakfast and arrived at the
courthouse. Back in the jury room, Ms. Walker said, the 12 jurors
voted aloud one by one, explaining their decisions. Each spoke for
death. It took about two hours.
</P>
<P>
   One other juror, a man, had been undecided on Friday night, Ms.
Walker said. When it came time for him to speak, Ms. Walker said,
he told the group that he would change to death. The brutality of
the crime had swayed him, she said, declining to identify him.
</P>
<P>
   In what she described as a ``monologue'' that lasted for several
minutes, Ms. Walker spoke last. ``I told them how I thought that
the spirit had told me to do whatever I thought was right because
God would have the final say,'' she recalled. ``Whatever we voted,
if God decided intervention was necessary, it would happen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them the peace that I now felt,'' she continued, ``and
that my answer was now death.''
</P>
<P>
   After delivering the verdict, the jurors reconvened in the jury
room. They all held hands and joined in a prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you,'' they prayed, ``for giving us the strength.''

PLANK ON ABORTION EXPECTED AT TEXAS GOP CONVENTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MAX B. BAKER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Texas Republicans are moving forward with a
platform proposal to deny campaign funds and party support to GOP
candidates who will not publicly support a ban on late-term
abortions.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee rejected a similar proposal
this year because party leaders feared it would be viewed as a
``litmus test'' that could cost the GOP its House and Senate
majorities.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Lambert, who represents Texas on the Republican National
Committee, proposed changing the state party's platform Wednesday.
He conceded it is a litmus test, but he compared it to the debate
the party has had over racism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Infanticide is on the same level as racism. And there is no
place in our party for people that support infanticide,'' said
Lambert, of Lubbock. He said other states' GOPs such as those in
California and Georgia have adopted similar resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of a handful of socially oriented platform proposals
being considered for this week's Texas Republican Party Convention
in Fort Worth. Many of the party's 14,000 delegates and alternates

UTILITY HEAD'S SEVERANCE PACKAGE TERMED `OUTRAGEOUS'
</HEADLINE>
  (dc) 
 By ADAM BRYANT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Even as he was leading one of the most troubled
utility companies in the United States, William J. Catacosinos was
working on another task: laying the foundation for a lucrative
departure from the utility, Long Island Lighting Co.
</P>
<P>
   The fruits of that labor emerged last week, when it was
disclosed that Catacosinos, 68, had received a $42 million payment
as a result of New York state's partial takeover of the utility.
Gov. George Pataki called the payments to Catacosinos and other top
LILCO executives ``disgraceful,'' ``outrageous'' and, above all,
``secret,'' and ordered an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many provisions leading to the payments were included
in public filings by LILCO with the Securities and Exchange
Commission over the years. But those documents included no specific
amounts that foreshadowed the $42 million payment, and the
provisions were so complicated and subject to interpretation that
state officials and others professed astonishment at learning the
figure.
</P>
<P>
   While $42 million may appear staggeringly high, experts on
executive compensation said packages in the tens of millions of
dollars are by no means unheard of these days for top executives.
Lucrative stock options, big bonuses and carefully crafted ``golden
parachutes'' have become standard for the leaders of many large
companies.
</P>
<P>
   And by far the biggest chunk of Catacosinos' package, $37
million, represents a lump-sum payment of pension benefits that
under other circumstances might have been spread out over many
years.
</P>
<P>
   But Catacosinos' deal was unusual in some important ways,
several experts said. His pay was above average for an executive in
the utility industry, and it rose sharply even as LILCO's
shareholders saw only modest long-term returns and as ratepayers
were saddled with huge bills. His contract language was written to
peg his pension to his most lucrative single year with the company,
rather than the average of pay over several years that other
companies often use.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for me to recall ever seeing a set of contractual
pay arrangements that were so stacked in favor of the executive and
against shareholders,'' said Graef Crystal, editor of the Crystal
Report, a newsletter on executive compensation. ``Everything has
been set up to favor him.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of Catacosinos even question whether the state takeover
of LILCO should be considered a ``change of control'' that would
trigger any special payments to him. After all, they say, he
continues to work as chief executive at Marketspan, the company
created by a partial takeover of LILCO's electrical service by the
state through the Long Island Power Authority and merging LILCO's
remaining divisions with the Brooklyn Union Gas holding company.
</P>
<P>
   Catacosinos draws the same salary from Marketspan that he got
from LILCO, but has not yet signed a contract with Marketspan's
board, said a company spokesman, Joseph McDonnell. The board will
meet for the first time Thursday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   This is not the first time Catacosinos' calculations of his
pension have been at the center of a dispute. After NCR Corp.
acquired a computer company he headed in 1980, it filed a lawsuit
contending that he had improperly inflated his pension before
leaving the company in 1982. The lawsuit was settled out of court.
</P>
<P>
   After Catacosinos agreed in 1984 to run LILCO, where he had been
a director since 1978, he said in many interviews that he took the
job because he wanted to give something back to the community.
McDonnell said he had accomplished that goal by increasing the
value of his company, cutting rates and protecting workers' jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of compensation, one would have to compare it to what
he might have received elsewhere had he not taken on the challenges
facing LILCO,'' McDonnell said.
</P>
<P>
   But Catacosinos has faced sharp criticism throughout his tenure
from ratepayers and politicians, and LILCO shares have performed
poorly compared with many other utilities and broader stock-market
indexes.
</P>
<P>
   Just days after becoming chairman of LILCO, Catacosinos cut
1,000 jobs, halted the utility's dividend to shareholders and cut
salaries across the board, including his own, which fell to
$220,000 from $275,000. It was restored to $275,000 the following
year, and rose steadily, to about $700,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
   His combined salary and bonus for last year was $1.9 million.
That is well below the average of $8.7 million in salary, bonuses
and stock options for all chief executives of large companies, said
Crystal, but is more than twice the median amount paid to eight
chief executives of similar-sized utilities.
</P>
<P>
   The high total for 1997 is especially significant because of an
unusual provision in Catacosinos' contract that bases his pension
in part on the highest bonus he received in a single year.
Typically, companies base that formula on an average of bonuses
over several years.
</P>
<P>
   McDonnell said Catacosinos had actually argued that he should
get a $63 million payment, rather than the $42 million the board
ultimately granted, because he was counting more of his 1997
bonuses than the board was.
</P>
<P>
   The board's decision that the state takeover amounts to a
``change of control'' led to several payments to Catacosinos based
on different contract provisions.
</P>
<P>
   He receives three years' salary totaling $2.1 million, a common
provision in contracts for chief executives.
</P>
<P>
   Catacosinos is also guaranteed a five-year consulting stint with
the company after he is terminated as chief executive. For the
first two years, he receives 90 percent of his final salary. In the
third and fourth years, he receives 75 percent of his salary. For
the final year, he gets 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   He gets an annual pension of $196,000 under the utility's
pension plan covering all employees. He also receives an additional
annual pension of $2.1 million, based on a formula that takes into
account his salary and bonus, among other things. But rather than
receiving that money every year, he got a lump sum payment of $36.9
million, according to Marketspan.
</P>
<P>
   Catacosinos also recently received two payments of $742,500 in
stock and $743,750 in cash under long-term incentive plans intended
to reward performance over several years.
</P>
<P>
   One or both of these was presumably included by Catacosinos in
his definition of pay in calculating the amount of his lump-sum
pension. The board disputed that definition and lowered his
requested total package of $63 million to $42 million.
</P>
<P>
   For completing transactions involving Brooklyn Union Gas and the
Long Island Power Authority, he also received $354,826 in stock.

PLANK ON ABORTION EXPECTED AT TEXAS GOP CONVENTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Texas Republicans are moving forward with a
platform proposal to deny campaign funds and party support to GOP
candidates who will not publicly support a ban on late-term
abortions.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee rejected a similar proposal
this year because party leaders feared it would be viewed as a
``litmus test'' that could cost the GOP its House and Senate
majorities.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Lambert, who represents Texas on the Republican National
Committee, proposed changing the state party's platform Wednesday.
He conceded it is a litmus test, but he compared it to the debate
the party has had over racism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Infanticide is on the same level as racism. And there is no
place in our party for people that support infanticide,'' said
Lambert, of Lubbock. He said other states' GOPs such as those in
California and Georgia have adopted similar resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of a handful of socially oriented platform proposals
being considered for this week's Texas Republican Party Convention
in Fort Worth. Many of the party's 14,000 delegates and alternates
are expected to arrive Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The state GOP convention, being held at the Fort Worth
Convention Center, is the largest in the country in terms of
delegates. Gov. George W. Bush will speak to the delegates Friday,
with the convention wrapping up Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the party's leadership was discussing the GOP
platform and rules, including Lambert's proposal on late-term
abortions referred to by foes as ``partial birth'' abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Known medically as intact dilation and extraction, a late-term
abortion involves removing a fetus feet first from the uterus and
piercing the head to allow it to pass through the cervix.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican controlled-Congress passed a late-term abortion
ban twice, but President Clinton vetoed the bills, citing
insufficient safeguards to protect the health and life of the
mother.
</P>
<P>
   Last month Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich promised swift
action on getting a ban on late-term abortions. Eighty-two percent
of Americans generally opposed the procedure in a 1996 Gallup Poll.
</P>
<P>
   Lambert, who presented a similar proposal to the national party,
and others predicted that his plank will sail through the party's
platform committees and be endorsed by the full convention
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are seeing is that the Republican National Party has
shown that it is out of touch, just as many of the national leaders
who opposed that effort showed they are out of touch,'' Lambert
said.

<P>
   With their eyes fixed on maintaining control of the Texas Senate
and taking over the Texas House for the first time in more than 120
years, many Republicans want to avoid any splashy confrontations
over issues such as abortion.
</P>

partial-birth abortions as are a majority of Democrats,'' said
Bryan Eppstein, a Fort Worth Republican political consultant who
represents several state officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``But for the political party to start having a litmus test is a
bad precedent to start,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although some people are concerned about Lambert's proposal,
there probably won't be any major scuffles over it or other parts
of the party's platform, said Michael Williams, chairman of the GOP
platform committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not sensing there will be dramatic changes in the
platform,'' said Williams, an Arlington attorney and general
counsel for the state party. ``One of our objectives is to make it
more voter-friendly and reader-friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Fisher, head of the subcommittee discussing family issues,
said the platform will undergo few changes and retain many of its
planks, including those opposing abortion and supporting school
choice and vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially it is going to stay very strong, very conservative
and most of what we are doing is grammatical cleanup and
housekeeping,'' said Fisher, of Bedford. ``There aren't going to be
any definitive issue changes.''

SPARKS BEGIN SECOND SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAMELA LEWIS  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Less than 24 hours after returning from the World Championships
in Germany, Lisa Leslie and Haixia Zheng were going through the
motions in their first practice with the Los Angeles Sparks
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   They were welcomed home by their teammates and then got busy
preparing for tonight's 7:30 WNBA season-opener against the Utah
Starzz and top draft pick 7-foot-2 Margo Dydek at the Delta Center
in Salt Lake City, Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Lisa) was supposed to come in and rest and sit down, her and
Haixia,'' Sparks coach Julie Rousseau said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rousseau wasn't complaining. The sooner she can get them
into the program the better. The Sparks last year finished 14-14,
one game from winning the Western Conference title and earning a
playoff berth last year before losing to Phoenix, 73-68, in
overtime. They began last season 4-7 under Linda Sharp and finished
10-7 when Rousseau took over as the head coach on July 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were that close last year, so we got a taste of what to
expect,'' Rousseau said.
</P>
<P>
   Only this time the stakes have been raised with a substantial
increase in talent league-wide. The Sparks capitalized on the
feeding frenzy, snatching pure shooter Allison Feaster from Harvard
as their top draft pick, and Octavia Blue, another outside scoring
threat from Miami.
</P>
<P>
   They join Leslie and Zheng as the Sparks finalized their
11-player roster Wednesday with returning guards Penny Toler,
Tamecka Dixon, Mwadi Mabika, and Katrina Colleton. They added 6-3
center-forward Pam McGee from Sacramento in exchange for Linda
Burgess, along with 6-3 Sandra VanEmbricqs, and guard Erin
Alexander. Jamila Wideman, who started last season before becoming
the backup point guard, has been placed on the injured reserve list
because of lower back strain, along with Eugenia RyCraw (strained
left knee). Forward Erica Kienast was waived.
</P>
<P>
   The Western Conference race got a lot tougher with the defending
champion Houston Comets moving from the Eastern Conference to
accommodate the expansion teams from Detroit and Washington.
Rousseau is more interested in what's going on her side of the
court than worrying about the Comets, who return league MVP Cynthia
Cooper as well as a healthy Sheryl Swoopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have enough to worry about. Yeh, we'll scout the other
teams, but we're going to take care of what we need to do - play
tough tenacious defense and be aggressive offensively. I feel
pretty good about our chances with Houston being in our
conference,'' Rousseau said.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks have much more depth, speed and athleticism than they
did last year. The addition of the aggressive style of play by
McGee will open a new window of opportunity in the low post, and
while Feaster and Blue are perimeter players, they're just as
capable of taking the ball inside. The explosive backcourt,
featuring Toler (quad) and Dixon (hamstring) were slightly hampered
early in training camp, but it's doubtful those injuries will slow
either down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ferrari's are on the road,'' quipped Toler.
</P>
<P>
   The two picked up in practice where they left off last season,
Dixon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very comfortable with Penny. Although, we've been away
from each other all off season we come right back and it's just
clicking because we know each other's game now.''
</P>
<P>
   It may take a few days for Leslie and Zheng to get over the jet
lag, but mentally and physically they feel prepared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling really good,'' said Leslie, who was still riding
off the adrenaline of USA 71-65 victory over Russia in the World
Championship final. `I'm very well way above where I was last
season at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Zheng, saddened because her Chinese team failed to make the
championship round, is looking to put all her enegry into the
Sparks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, this team will do much better this year than last
year,'' Zheng said. ``We'll do our best.''
</P>

BAGGIO BACK, SEEKING WORLD CUP GLORY
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ It's been nearly four years since Roberto Baggio, the
``Divine Ponytail'' whose heroics lifted Italy into the 1994 World
Cup championship game, missed the most famous penalty kick in
history, handing Brazil its fourth crown on an ill-fated afternoon
in the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The ponytail is gone now, but Baggio despite all evidence to the
contrary remains, and against all odds he could be the central
figure this evening when the Italians open their 1998 campaign
against Chile in Bordeaux.
</P>
<P>
   The gifted forward, 31, who has endured a difficult time on the
field since single-handedly lifting the Azzurri into the '94 title
game, lives these days in the shadow of 23-year-old Alessandro Del
Piero, his successor at Juventus and with the Italian squad.
</P>
<P>
   But it is Baggio, because of an abductor muscle injury to Del
Piero, who will play the key role in the most crucial of his team's
first-round encounters.
</P>
<P>
   ``In July a year ago, how many of you would have bet on me being
here?'' he teased reporters. ``I was the only one.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a long time in coming Baggio has made only one start for
Italy, in a warmup match earlier this month, since November 1994,
but if he's looking for redemption or to prove that he belongs,
he's keeping it to himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that the first choice is Del Piero,'' he says. ``I've
already won my World Cup by just being called up to the squad. ...
(But) if the opportunity arises, I'll do what I can to make people
remember me, just like at USA '94.''
</P>
<P>
   He is remembered best for what he couldn't do in '94, place a
penalty kick past goalkeeper Claudio Taffarel and into the net. His
shot cleared the crossbar, and he sank to his knees as the
Brazilian celebration raged around him.
</P>
<P>
   What too often is forgotten is what he accomplished up to that
point, scoring sensational late goals against Nigeria and Spain to
prod a plodding Azzurri into the semifinals, giving a spirited
performance in the final and playing 120 minutes despite a badly
pulled hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   The penalty kick miss seemed to lead him into a downward spiral.
Arrigo Sacchi, Italy coach Cesare Maldini's predecessor, dropped
him from the squad in late 1994, and a lauded transfer to
then-power AC Milan quickly soured, with Baggio relegated to the
bench for much of his two years there.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't considered for the 1996 European Championships, a
disastrous event for Italy, and played no impact on the Azzurri's
difficult qualification for this tournament. But a move to Bologna,
where he scored a career-high 22 goals this past season, paid off
when Maldini selected him last month for the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   He'll be back on the field today, seeking to create a little
more magic to start the Italians toward what they hope will be
their fourth World Cup title. Soon, he knows, he will be back on
the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Maldini says as much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Del Piero is the No. 1 player of the Italian team,'' says the
coach, whose son, Paolo, is Italy's captain and top defender. ``I
believe he will be one of the stars in the World Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   Baggio hasn't a problem with that. He'll do whatever's necessary
to aid the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've come here knowing the way things are,'' he says. ``It's
true I'm Roberto Baggio, but in this squad, there are people who
were chosen before me. All I'm saying is that if the need arises,
I'll be ready. I'm living through this with a sense of calm, and
obviously, with hope.''

   GREENSPAN FINDS ECONOMY IS EXTRAORDINARILY SOUND
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan declared the economy to
be in extraordinarily good shape and signaled that he saw no
immediate need to strike against inflation by raising interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   His testimony before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress
was sprinkled with caveats about how the combination of low
unemployment and strong growth could eventually force the Fed to
raise rates. But for now price pressures are subdued and Asia's
crisis is taking some of the steam out of the American economy.

<P>
   TOBACCO COMPANY LIABILITY FOUND
</P>
<P>
   A Florida jury found Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco liable for a
smoker's death and ordered the company to pay $1 million in
compensatory and punitive damages. The case was viewed as a major
defeat for cigarette makers that could affect the course of federal
tobacco legislation, and tobacco stocks slumped.
</P>
<P>
   A TAX BREAK FROM CIGARETTE MONEY
</P>
<P>
   Giving strength to anti-smoking legislation, the Senate voted to
use part of the money that would be raised from higher cigarette
prices to give an income-tax break to married couples with annual
incomes below $50,000, to reduce the marriage tax penalty.

   BIG HEALTH CARE COMPANIES MERGE
</P>
<P>
   Health Care and Retirement and Manor Care Inc. agreed to merge
in a stock swap valued at about $2.45 billion. Analysts applauded
the deal, which will create one of the nation's largest operators
of nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   FURTHER DECLINE IN YEN EXPECTED
</P>
<P>
   Japan is in such an economic straitjacket, some veteran analysts
contend, that the yen must fall even further than it has _ 4.4
percent in the last month to 141.43 to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of Japan's governing Liberal Democratic Party are
suggesting that they will not rescue financial institutions on the
verge of insolvency.

EEOC SUES TWA OVER SEXUAL HARASSMENT CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By TERRY PRISTIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sued
Trans World Airlines on Wednesday, saying the company failed to
intervene after three female employees accused three high-level
managers of engaging in unwanted touching, using crude language and
demanding sexual favors.
</P>
<P>
   The EEOC filed the lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn
after investigating complaints of sexual harassment made in October
by three Long Island women against Ino Sylman, the manager
responsible for TWA's ground-safety and security operations at
Kennedy International Airport, and two other senior managers, said
Elizabeth Grossman, a trial lawyer for the federal agency. She said
that eight current and former TWA employees had signed affidavits
supporting the women, and that other women were expected to come
forward with accusations against the officials.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued Wednesday, TWA strenuously denied the
allegations. ``Trans World Airlines does not tolerate
discrimination in any form, including sexual harassment,'' the
statement said. ``We took these allegations seriously and
investigated them thoroughly when they were brought to our
attention. We found no corroboration of the charges made by these
three individuals, and we consider these charges to be false and
without merit.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jim Brown, a spokesman at TWA's headquarters in St. Louis, said
that the company would have no further comment.
</P>
<P>
   Of the three women named in the complaint, the most senior was
Veronica Saunders, 37, of Farmingdale, a supervisor of passenger
service who left the company in April. Ms. Saunders, who said she
has been unable to find a new job, was responsible for monitoring
baggage and passenger security check points and insuring that
safety and security requirements were met, according to a separate
lawsuit she filed with the two other women: Joanne Geskie, 32, of
Franklin Square, and Susan Congema, 28, of East Meadow.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Geskie, a flight information coordinator whose duties
included assigning gates to aircraft and handling police and
medical emergencies, also left TWA in April, after working for the
company for 10 years. During that period, she said in a telephone
interview, Sylman's behavior worsened. ``As time went on,'' she
said, ``he would be grabbing and groping, pulling my shirt out to
look. He'd show me his erection by pulling his pants up against his
body so you could see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Grossman said that Sylman and the two other TWA officials
named in the lawsuit _ George Cintron, a manager in the Building
and Maintenance Department, and Garfield Harris, a manager in the
Passenger Service Department _ had distracted the women from their
duties and could have endangered the public. ``They had jobs that
were very important in terms of insuring the safety of aircraft,''
she said. ``Despite the harassment, they were able to perform their
jobs, but it's not easy when you have someone propositioning you
day in and day out.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the lawsuit, Ms. Saunders took her complaints to
three high-level TWA managers, but instead of taking action, the
airline retaliated against her by taking away her private office
and denying her any time off. Ms. Congema, also a flight
information coordinator, was denied a promotion earlier this year,
the lawsuit said. She continues to report to Sylman, but her work
hours no longer coincide with his, said Robert Lipman, one of the
lawyers representing the women.
</P>
<P>
   Lipman, who has litigated other sexual harassment complaints,
said that this case was unusual in that most harassment incidents
involve smutty remarks and behavior. ``They don't actually involve
supervisors wanting to have sex,'' he said. &QL;

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FARMINGDALE, N.Y. _ There was familiar pageantry Wednesday, a
sea of dark suits and white gloves as thousands of somber
firefighters paid homage to a fallen colleague.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after a procession of drummers in green kilts, a lone
bagpiper marked the passing of Lt. James W. Blackmore, a New York
City firefighter who died on Friday trying to rescue a missing
woman who, unknown to him, had already escaped a burning house.
</P>
<P>
   To his colleagues, he was more than just someone willing to give
his life for the job. Some remembered Jimmy Blackmore and his
quirks: he was seldom without a bottle of liquid that he said was a
good mouthwash and eyewash, but could also be used to fight fires.
</P>
<P>
   He was legendary for his messy desk. But most of all, he was
known as a family man, and Wednesday's service was as much about
his four young children and the legacy they were left as about
Blackmore.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as Jimmy gave us, the real center of his universe was
his family,'' said Capt. Francis Johnston. Addressing the children
by name, he said, ``Brian, when you're fishing, your father is
helping you pull the fish out; Sara, Claire, when you're acting,
your father is clapping like crazy; Jackie, when you draw a
picture, he's smiling.''
</P>
<P>
   The fire that took Blackmore's life in East New York, Brooklyn,
last Friday also injured eight other firefighters, including Capt.
Scott LaPiedra. More than 70 percent of his body was burned, and he
is battling for his life at Jacobi Medical Center in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Calling Blackmore a hero, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, like the
other speakers, mentioned the unassuming nature of the fallen
firefighter. The mayor noted that one of his brothers had no idea
that Blackmore had five commendations from the Fire Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he went into that building,'' the mayor said, ``he didn't
ask if the person was Jewish, Protestant or Catholic, black, white
or Hispanic. He just went.''
</P>
<P>
   Addressing Blackmore's widow, Susan, and his children, Sara, 13,
Jacqueline, 11, Claire, 9, and Brian, 7, he said: ``He's not gone.
He's in each of the four children. He's in the lessons he taught
them. They can draw on that for strength.''
</P>
<P>
   The funeral Mass for Blackmore, 48, held in the auditorium of
the St. Kilian Roman Catholic Parish in his hometown of
Farmingdale, drew an estimated 12,000 firefighters, along with an
array of dignitaries, including the mayor, Gov. George E. Pataki,
Fire Commissioner Thomas Von Essen and the Nassau County Executive,
Thomas Gulotta.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki called Blackmore and other firefighters ``the greatest of
the greatest heroes,'' and said there is ``no greater sacrifice''
than risking one's life to save the life of another.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most touching tribute to the firefighter came from
Johnson, the head of Engine Company 332, to which Blackmore was
assigned, who remembered the lieutenant as someone who avoided
praise but delighted in praising others.
</P>
<P>
   ``He tried to be away from the center of attention,'' he said.
``But he liked to tell the men they did a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Msgr. John P. Martin, associate pastor of St. Kilian, told a
story about Blackmore's heroism that got scant attention, just as
he wanted it. While driving home from the hospital with his
youngest child, Brian, then a newborn, Blackmore and his wife
witnessed an accident. Blackmore stopped, pulled the driver from
the car, got back in his car and kept going, never taking credit.
To this day, it is believed to be an act of an unknown good
Samaritan, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Msgr. Charles W. Swiger said many are asking why this death had
to happen. The better question, he said, ``is not, `Why did Jimmy
die?' but, `Why did he live?' '' He invoked the book of Job, noting
that God told Job, after Job's trials, ``You don't know my mind and
you can't plumb my reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin offered an answer. ``He was a gift,'' he said. ``God who
gave him has called him back to himself.''

EDITORIAL: CATACOSINOS CASHES IN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, June 11:
</P>
<P>
   For years Long Island Lighting Co., or LILCO, has been very
unpopular on Long Island. People resented its rates _ the highest
in the nation _ and politicians found it easier to run against it
than against each other.
</P>
<P>
   Thus it appeared to be a brilliant political stroke _ if not
exactly consistent with traditional Republican philosophy _ when
Gov. George Pataki engineered a state takeover of LILCO's
distribution capacity. Thanks in part to the refinancing of LILCO's
huge debt with tax-exempt municipal bonds, most electric bills are
being cut by about 20 percent. If all goes as planned, electricity
customers will be getting rebate checks of $101 to $232 this fall,
not long before the governor stands for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   But the political benefits of all that could be in jeopardy
because some former LILCO executives, most notably William
Catacosinos, the company's chairman and chief executive, are
getting $67 million in payouts, with $42 million going to
Catacosinos. Pataki is furious, saying the payouts are
``disgraceful'' and ``outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the payments to Catacosinos do strain logic. He gets
$2.6 million to compensate him for losing the right to consult for
LILCO after retirement, and $2.1 million as a golden parachute for
losing his LILCO job. But he has not lost his job, although Pataki
thinks he should. He is chairman of Marketspan, the company that
was formed by the merger of the old Brooklyn Union Gas Co. with the
parts of LILCO not bought by the state, with a base salary of
$700,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the rest of his compensation _ $34 million _ is said to
be a lump-sum settlement of Catacosinos' pension benefits under his
extraordinarily generous LILCO employment contract.
</P>
<P>
   The amount going to Catacosinos is outrageous, especially
considering LILCO's poor record as an electricity supplier. Of
course, in one respect he did a great job, but it was not for the
people who pay electric bills. The costs of the never-opened
Shoreham nuclear plant fell not on the investors, as they might
have, but on ratepayers and taxpayers. LILCO shareholders ended up
doing reasonably well.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki is right in saying this is a disgraceful cash-in for an
executive of a public utility that did such a spotty job of serving
the public. But Marketspan appears to be correct when it says the
payments were due under contracts that were previously made public.
In other words, Pataki should have used his bargaining clout to
restrict Catacosinos' windfall before he started selling his LILCO
takeover plan to the public. Pataki's outrage is well aimed, but
way too late. &QL;

EDITORIAL: THE GAME OF BUDGET GOTCHA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, June 11:
</P>
<P>
   New York's City Hall these days has the feel of a student
government convention, with grown politicians scrambling to reread
the city charter in search of new and unimagined ways to check or
ultimately checkmate the opposition. What has provoked this extreme
case of governmental gamesmanship is this year's budget process.
While it is generally a sleepy debate between the mayor and the
City Council, this year the two sides have been walloping each
other with parliamentary brickbats. This sudden vigor would be
terrific sport, except that it involves $34 billion of the public's
money.
</P>
<P>
   Each side has a different version of who upended the budget
process this year. Council Speaker Peter Vallone and his team have
said that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's people simply refuse to
negotiate until Vallone drops his idea of a referendum on Yankee
Stadium. The mayor's corner has argued that Vallone, who is running
for governor, is using the referendum and the budget to help him
get the big job in Albany next year. While the mayor and his staff
have an elaborate method for bumping the Vallone referendum off
this year's ballot, it would be far better if Vallone voluntarily
scrapped his referendum. It is a political ploy that would yield a
crude decision on a matter that should take a great deal of complex
thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the referendum suddenly disappeared, however, the city
budget is now launched into uncharted territory. For all the unease
about this process, it has provided a chance to study the city's
fiscal matters in a new way, with a Council alternative budget
being the focus of debate instead of Giuliani's.
</P>
<P>
   While the differences between them are modest, the City
Council's budget does offer a few improvements over the mayor's
version. The Council's plan to use $165 million to pay down the
debt, as well as extra allotments for a new after-school program
and weekly recycling, look like sensible expenditures from a huge
surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than negotiating these items and differences over
proposed tax deductions, the mayor has vetoed his list of budget
items, and the Council is ready to override them. The mayor can
then refuse or delay writing the checks, and both sides can go to
court. But rather than escalate the conflict this way, it is time
to drop the outside issues _ like any referendum _ and go back to
negotiating the budget. In all but rhetoric, the two sides are very
close. &QL;

REFLECTIONS ON OWN GOALS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS Tommy Boyd and Youssef Chippo may have been inconsolable
Wednesday night, but they should be thanking God --- indeed, they
may be --- that they are from civilized lands.
</P>
<P>
   Each scored an ``own goal'' --- that is, a goal against their
team --- on an extraordinary first day of the 1998 World Cup, a
minor crime in soccer that can carry a heavy price, at least in,
say, Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   It's a rare occurrence, but it happens, but neither Boyd nor
Chippo wanted to hear that after keeping their squads from what
would have been tremendous accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd, who had a fine match for a gutty Scotland side that
battled Brazil to the end, knocked in the winner in the reigning
champs' 2-1 triumph at Saint-Denis. And Morocco's Chippo,
desperately trying to prevent a goal seconds before the halftime
whistle, helped Norway overcome an early deficit in a 2-2 draw at
Montpellier.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly wasn't the type of goal that you like to score
but there was absolutely nothing I could do about it,'' said Boyd,
who watched helplessly as the ball ricocheted from Cafu's foot to
Scottish goalkeeper Jim Leighton's face to his arm and into the net
to break a 1-1 tie with 17 minutes to go. ``It's probably the worst
feeling I've ever had in football.''
</P>
<P>
   Chippo's error, during first-half injury time, erased a 1-0
lead; it followed a Stig Inge Bjornebye free kick that Moroccan
goalkeeper Driss Benzekri misplayed. The ball bounced off Norway's
Henning Berg, and Chippo, trying to head the ball wide of the far
post, nodded it into his net.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very, very disappointing to make silly mistakes after
taking control of the game and giving ourselves a good chance of
victory,'' complained Morocco coach Henri Michel.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, well. It's only a game, and players make mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   But tell that to Andres Escobar, the Colombian defender who lost
his life over an own goal four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Again, a simple error.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. midfielder John Harkes sent a cross into Colombia's box,
and Escobar, trying to keep it from finding another Yank, stuck his
foot out. His goalkeeper was leaning the other way, and neither
could do a thing aside from watch it roll into the net. The
Americans pulled out a 2-1 stunner and Colombia, one of the pre-Cup
favorites, returned home in disgrace.
</P>
<P>
   Before the tournament was over, Escobar was dead, shot by a man
who first thanked him for the own goal. U.S. and Colombian
authorities believe the killer was a hit man for a gambling
syndicate.
</P>
<P>
   It was, true, an isolated incident. No other World Cup star has
ever died because of an on-field mistake. But Colombian players and
coaches must live with the threat of death daily. Colombia's coach,
Hernan Dario Gomez, has received dozens of death threats, some
directed at his family, usually after his team gives a poor
performance or he makes an unpopular decision.
</P>
<P>
   It is part of the job, although that doesn't mean Gomez accepts
it. He has urged Colombians to be ``patient and forgiving'' if
things don't go as they hope in France.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do well here, I will go home a god,'' he says. ``But if
things go badly, I'll be a devil.''
</P>
<P>
   No such fate awaits Boyd and Chippo. They'll be back on the
field Tuesday, when Scotland takes on Norway and Morocco meets
Brazil, then again on June 23, when their teams tangle in a Group A
finale.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, possibly both, will head home when that game's
over. They'll be greeted by a pat on the back, a ``good job,
mate,'' and go on with their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Escobar deserved.

   U.S. team gets shot of confidence for Germany
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN P. LOPEZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SAINT DENIS, France _ The biggest confidence boost came Tuesday
night, when the U.S. national soccer team put on an overwhelming
offensive show in a 4-0 exhibition victory over French professional
team Gueugnon.
</P>
<P>
   It was the final game for the Americans before facing the
heavily favored German team in both squads' 1998 World Cup opener
next Monday in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. win over Gueugnon was a significant game if only
because as strong as the Americans have played for the most part
lately, scoring goals was becoming a concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got what we needed out of that game,'' U.S. defender and
captain Thomas Dooley said. ``We got our offense going.''
</P>
<P>
   And Wednesday, as the veteran U.S. team gathered at its plush
Chateau de Pizay near Lyon, it got a bit more of a confidence
boost.
</P>
<P>
   The team watched Scotland hang in with the best team in the
world, Brazil, and fall just short of earning a tie and gaining a
point in Wednesday's Cup opener.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans have long admitted that their most realistic goal
for their opening World Cup match was to tie Germany and then try
to defeat Yugoslavia and Iran to secure a berth in the second round
of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we have ever been better prepared for a World
Cup, but a lot of this has to do with just understanding the
pressures involved in a World Cup and understanding that anything
can happen,'' U.S. coach Steve Sampson said. ``Of course, we are
underdogs. I think this can work in our favor. If (Germany) has any
weakness, it might be that they are overconfident.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a very special effort to do well in this World Cup.
Coming together as a group and focusing and concentrating will be a
big part of our ability to achieve that kind of success.''
</P>
<P>
   Even at that, oddsmakers are not considering the Americans to be
second-round material. Widely considered to have its best national
soccer team ever, the U.S. drew a group that includes the
three-time champion Germans and Yugoslavia, which some are picking
as a dark horse to win the entire tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Germany is a 2-5 favorite to win the group, Yugoslavia is 4-1,
and the Americans are 15-1, with Iran considered a three-and-out
team in the round-robin phase of the Cup. Overall, Germany and
Yugoslavia are ranked among eight teams considered most likely to
win the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the U.S. team has played confidently, and the coach says
the long odds won't matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are close to starting, and we're happy with how we've
prepared,'' Sampson said. ``There are two phases to our preparation
in France. The first was to acclimate to the time zone, continue
with physical fitness, gain confidence on the ball and focus and
concentrate on why we are here.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the second phase, which started after (the exhibition
game), we're trying to make sure we are injury-free and understand
tactically how we will approach the Germany match. We will refine
set pieces and make sure everyone is comfortable with their role.
We'll be ready.''

EAST TEXAS TOWN TRYING TO COME TO GRIPS WITH SLAYING
</HEADLINE>

By BARRY SHLACHTER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ There are no likenesses of African-Americans in
historic photographs displayed in the old but striking Jasper
County courthouse. The newest, dated 1955, depicts the first woman
admitted to a jury in this community, tucked in the folds of
conservative East Texas' Piney Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Yet no easy stereotype can be drawn of Jasper, a town of 8,000
where three white ex-convicts with white supremacist ties are
accused of carrying out one of contemporary Texas' most heinous
crimes: the dragging death and decapitation of a disabled black
man.
</P>
<P>
   ``JASPER TEXAS IS MOURNING HURTING CRYING,'' read a sign at the
Splish Splash Car Wash, summing up the mood of many. ``AMERICA
PLEASE PRAY FOR US.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a foregone conclusion that the nation will see Jasper as a
racist community, said Joline Larecy, the white car wash owner.
Locally, she only got ``thumbs up'' from customers for putting up
the sign, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, the murder is going to give Jasper a bad look
for a long time,'' Larecy said of the Saturday night killing of
James Byrd Jr., 49.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully people from around the country will realize this is
an isolated incident. People in this area don't feel this hatred
for others.''
</P>
<P>
   The city's business leaders, concerned that Jasper might be
indelibly stamped a redneck community, have scheduled a meeting to
see if it's too late to repair the town's image. The meeting was
called by a hospital administrator who is black, as are the mayor
and two of the five city council members. Blacks also serve on the
school board, which has had an African-American president, and the
hospital district board.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not without its racial problems, but we work things
out,'' said Willis Webb, publisher of the weekly Jasper News-Boy,
who is white.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald King, whose son John William King is one of the three men
accused in Byrd's death, released a letter of apology to news
agencies Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sympathy goes out to the Byrd family. There is no reason
for a person to take the life of another, and to take it in such a
manner is beyond any kind of reasoning,'' King said in the letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts me deeply to know that a boy I raised and considered
to be the most loved boy I knew could find it in himself to take a
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deed cannot be undone, but I hope we can all find it in
our hearts to go forward in peace, and with love for all. Let us
find in our hearts love for our fellow man. Hate can only
destroy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Greg Chambers says Jasper is far from a perfect
community. But not until Byrd's death had there been an act of
outright racism since Chambers moved from Beaumont north to Jasper
six years ago. And no one has made a major complaint to the local
NAACP chapter during that time, the black minister said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are underlying fears and prejudices here, but they're
not overt. People here treat you in a dignified, professional
manner,'' said Chambers, who was the only black member of the
Jasper Rotary Club when it elected him president in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers was not star struck by Jesse Jackson's visit Wednesday
and confided that the timing was not helpful.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is calming down and things are heading in the
right direction,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially, we were worried that there were more than three
involved. Just a lot of fear in the community. But the sheriff
assured the black community that justice would be done. And when he
heard the `N' word used so often, he recognized it was a racial
crime and brought in the FBI.''
</P>
<P>
   After the first word of the torture-murder came out, Chambers
and other blacks and whites immediately speculated that it was in
revenge for the beating death of a white contractor, Jerry Lynn
McQueen, the previous Sunday. A black former employee, Donald
Kennebrew, was arrested on suspicion of murder.
</P>
<P>
   But Jasper County Sheriff Billy Rowles has said publicly that
there is no indication that retaliation was a motive in the assault
on Byrd. And few in Jasper see Byrd's torture death as a
tit-for-tat racial killing.
</P>
<P>
   But many blacks, who compose about 46 percent of the population,
remain unsettled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me myself, I'm worried, worried scared, enough to make me want
to leave here,'' said Belinda Garrett, 26, Byrd's neighbor. She
recalled a gentle, joyful man who loved to sing and quiz children
on their math skills. The right answer earned a dollar bill, she
said. And he would eagerly fulfill requests to sing the Prince
song, ``Purple Rain.'' ``He just loved to sing, and asked us to
call him, `Purple Rain,' '' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jasper is a quiet town until this happened, but we had racism
in the schools,'' Garrett said. Still, she could recall only one
minor incident in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   At a bench on the courthouse square, a recent high school
graduate said he didn't recall that clash but remembered a scrap
between a white girl, his sister, and a black girl in 1988. Now,
friendships between whites and blacks are anything but rare, said
Jason Cowart, 18.
</P>
<P>
   Like others, he fretted for his hometown's image.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Jasper is being labeled as a typical, ` ``To Kill a
Mockingbird,'' Atticus Finch' town,'' he said of the novel and
movie about a defense attorney confronting entrenched racism in a
small Southern town. ``It's not like that at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Jesse Jackson arrived, a standing-room-only prayer vigil
was under way at the Greater New Bethel Church. The crowd inside
and a larger one outside were predominantly black but scores of
whites mixed easily, many wearing small primrose ribbons.
</P>
<P>
   ``They symbolize peace and unity,'' explained red-haired Melanie
Radcliff, 14. ``We'll be wearing them till justice is served.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the white minister of the city's biggest Southern
Baptist church was called to the microphone and beseeched God to
``bind us together.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope you take this tragedy and work it toward that end,''
said the Rev. Ed Robinson of the First Baptist Church. ``Bind us
together in love.''
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Mays, publisher of a black biweekly newspaper in Jasper,
turned to a neighbor at the rear and said she was moved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never before in my life have I heard a white man say something
like that from a pulpit in Jasper.''

Air cleared as Swoopes 
meets with Chancellor
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By W.H. STICKNEY JR. &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Whatever problems may have arisen the day before because of Sheryl
Swoopes' unexcused absence from two Comets practices had all but
vanished by Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   All of the involved parties _ Swoopes, coach Van Chancellor and
Cynthia Cooper _ issued that as the company line at least, saying
any problems were solved in a couple of Wednesday meetings, one a
45-minute, face-to-face session between Chancellor and Swoopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 11:30 a.m., I met with Sheryl Swoopes,'' Chancellor said.
``At 12:15, all the problems between Sheryl Swoopes and myself and
this basketball team were solved.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, at a team meeting that lasted almost an hour, Chancellor
said any further problems unrelated to Swoopes' absences similarly
were put to rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just had some situations on this team that had to be
resolved on who was going to be the rebounder, who was going to be
the passer, who was going to be the shooter, and who was going to
be what,'' Chancellor said. ``Being honest with you as a coach, I
think this was one of the best things that ever could have happened
to us. We just needed to get some things out in the open, get them
solved. We got them solved.''
</P>
<P>
   Swoopes on Tuesday was a no-show when the Comets went through
two workouts, the second a two-hour drill at Rice's Autry Court
that was open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to the team said Swoopes' absence was a means of
underscoring her displeasure over having to play a secondary role
to Cooper during an 81-79 exhibition loss at Cleveland on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. It had nothing to do with that,'' Swoopes said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the problem were serious enough for her to consider
asking to be traded, Swoopes said, ``No. I would never want to be
traded. I want to come back here and play with the Comets and
hopefully defend our championship. That's what I'm looking forward
to doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Swoopes seemed amazed Tuesday's incidents became a major issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this kind of got blown out of proportion,'' she said.
``Honestly, I did the wrong thing. I did not call coach Chancellor
Tuesday morning to let him know why I wouldn't be there. And it
wasn't just basketball. There were some personal things I had to
take care of.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we worked it out, and I'm ready to come out here and do
what I've got to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The major reason Swoopes gave for being absent involved
baby-sitting problems.
</P>
<P>
   As was the case last summer when she joined the Comets in July,
Swoopes has brought her mother from Lubbock to serve as chief
sitter for her 10-month-old son. On Tuesday, Swoopes said, her mom
was ill and her husband was away from home, leaving her with no one
to baby-sit, morning or evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met with coach. We talked. Everything's fine now,'' Swoopes
said. ``There's no problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The former Texas Tech standout discounted the notion she and
Cooper have been at odds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since I came back,'' Swoopes said, ``Cynthia and I sat
down and talked, and I feel like both of us complement each other's
game well. And I think we have an opportunity to do something that
probably will never be done again. That's hopefully win four or
five (WNBA) championships together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Cynthia is a tremendous player, a tremendous athlete.
She'd better think the same thing about me,'' Swoopes said,
laughing. ``I hope she does. Not only the two of us, but Tina
(Thompson), also.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is definitely no problem between me and Cynthia, between
me and Tina, me and anyone else on the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor said Swoopes remains subject to punishment for
missing practice. But as of Wednesday night, he hadn't determined
what that would be.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, too, tried to lay to rest lingering speculation about a
clash between her and Swoopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no problem between Sheryl and Cynthia Cooper,''
Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Cooper turned her attention toward the hourlong team
meeting, which came three days before Saturday's season opener at
home against the New York Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always personality problems when you bring a lot of
different players together,'' she said. ``The key is whether you're
able to work them out as a team. We were able to work them out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came together, we voiced all of our opinions, we got them
out on the table, and we got it taken care of. Now, we're looking
forward to starting the season. It's going to be great.''

HOUSE PASSES BILL TO DISCOURAGE PERSONAL BANKRUPTCY 
</HEADLINE>
  (dc) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House passed far-reaching legislation Wednesday
to tighten the bankruptcy laws for the first time in a generation,
in an effort to discourage the growing practice of consumers'
declaring personal bankruptcy to erase their debts.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which would make it harder to declare bankruptcy,
passed 306 to 118, with the support of 222 Republicans and 84
Democrats. No Republicans voted against the measure.
</P>
<P>
   The bill ``represents another example of this Congress' efforts
to encourage individual responsibility,'' said Rep. Scott McInnis,
R-Colo. ``We will re-notify people that they do need to be held
accountable for their debts that they have accumulated. We will
remind them about keeping their word. We will remind them about
`Don't go out and spend money that you don't have.'''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would prohibit anyone earning more than the
national median income for his or her family size _ $50,000 for a
family of four, for example _ from declaring personal bankruptcy
under chapter 7 laws, in which virtually all debts are forgiven.
Those earning more than $50,000 and deemed able to repay at least
20 percent within five years would have to adhere to a payment
schedule under chapter 13.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's Republican sponsors in the House gained valuable
last-minute support by softening their stance on child-support and
alimony payments. They originally would have given credit-card
companies equal legal footing with single parents in trying to
recover such payments from someone who has filed for bankruptcy.
But a new provision appeared to ensure that payments to families
would be given priority over credit-card debts.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the change, critics maintained that the bill was still a
billion-dollar gift to what they described as a voracious
credit-card industry that inundates consumers with promises of easy
credit even when those consumers are already deeply in debt.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said the bill had ``one central
purpose _ to take large sums of money from middle- and low-income
American families in distress and give it to the credit-card
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether the provisions of the House bill will
become law. This summer, the Senate is to take up its own version,
which would give bankruptcy judges more leeway to set repayment
schedules. And, administration officials have said that President
Clinton objects to using income to determine whether someone is
eligible to file for bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters said that tightening the rules would reduce
bankruptcy filings _ 1.3 million last year, a record high for the
seventh year in a row, despite the robust economy. They also said
that too many consumers casually file for bankruptcy as a financial
planning tool. The bill would force those who file for bankruptcy
to pay most debts they accumulate within 90 days of filing.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. George Gekas, R-Pa., the principal sponsor, said debtors
needed to be yoked into bearing more responsibility and that he was
``bored to tears'' by the argument that credit card companies were
to blame for offering easy credit.
</P>
<P>
   This reasoning helped persuade swing voters, including
conservative House Democrats who have formed a group called the New
Democratic Coalition. Filing for bankruptcy ``shouldn't be as
convenient as going into a 7-Eleven,'' said Rep. Tim Roemer,
D-Ind., a coalition leader. Another leader, Rep. James Moran,
D-Va., noted that more Americans file for bankruptcy than graduate
from college.
</P>
<P>
   But consumer advocates predicted the bill would inflict disaster
on those already struggling. Mary Rouleau, legislative director of
the Consumer Federation of America, called the bill a ``debtor's
prison without walls'' because it would deny people a fresh start.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Sommer, a lawyer with the Consumer Bankruptcy Assistance
Project in Philadelphia, said that about 70 percent of those who
filed for bankruptcy did so under chapter 7. Of those filing under
chapter 13, two-thirds _ about 280,000 a year _ already fail to
meet their repayment schedule, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The differences between supporters and opponents were
crystalized by an exchange between Rep. Chet Edwards, D-Texas, and
McInnis.
</P>
<P>
   McInnis said that no one was forcing anyone to use a credit
card.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said that was like saying drug dealers should not be
held accountable for drug abuse. ``If that's the kind of personal
responsibility that's behind this bill,'' he said in disgust, ``I
don't want any part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   McInnis responded that merchants were not responsible for the
customers' debts. ``If you can't afford it,'' he said, nearly
shouting, ``don't buy it.'' &QL;

BARE-BONES REALIST WELCOMES NEIGHBORS AT NUDIST RESORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA HELSER   
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (NEW RIVER, Ariz.) - New River When a New River nudist invited
neighborhood children over for free swimming lessons, skepticism
was as rampant as the saguaros surrounding his L-shaped pool.
</P>
<P>
   But Horst Kraus, the retired plumber who lives to bask in the
buff on his 38-acre spread called Shangri-La II Resort in New
River, 30 miles north of Phoenix, is also a bare-bones realist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know other people think we're weird,'' he said. ``So
anything we can do to change or kill that stigma, the better.''
</P>
<P>
   Working under the premise that ``to know us is to love us,'' the
German-born naturalist who purchased the nudist resort 1{ years ago
opened his gates to neighbors so that any myths or
misunderstandings about naturalists might be dispelled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, we have this pool and there's no place around here
for these kids to swim,'' he said. ``And if this avoids just one
water accident, then it's well worth keeping our clothes on for the
four hours every Tuesday.''
</P>
<P>
   In a flyer he circulated through the neighborhood, Kraus vowed
to make the ultimate sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I promised that resort residents would be `textiled' during
the lessons,'' said the grandfather of five. In other words, they
would be wearing their clothes between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. every
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   None of the 22 families who live at Shangri-La full-time balked
at the proposed cover-up. To add an air of credibility, Kraus
enlisted the endorsement of the local Kiwanis Club, asking that one
or two members make an appearance at lessons.
</P>
<P>
   And after hiring a water safety instructor, Kraus and his wife,
Gigi, sat back and waited to see if anyone would accept their
hospitality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured maybe 12 to 15 at the most,'' he said. To his
amazement, 56 children rolled up to the pink-colored gates June 2
for the first of 11 weekly classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been curious about this place but I'd never come
over here for something other than this because I'd be too shy,''
said Deanna Wakeling of New River. She rubbed sun block lotion on
her 10-week-old son, Micah, the youngest of the students, as her
four-year-old son, Seth, splashed nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Another mom admitted she was nervous about her first on-site
encounter at Shangri-La.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did sort of worry that we'd get here too early,'' said
Connie Rohkohl. ``But we looked at the clock and it was 10:08 so we
thought we were OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerned there could be an accidental slip-up on the promised
cover-ups, Kraus asked two residents to post themselves near the
pool area. ``That's so someone doesn't stumble out of their
trailer, you know, who forgot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even the swim instructor had a few fabricated misgivings about
her new job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the ad in the paper for an instructor and when I called
they asked if I knew what Shangri-La was,'' said Becca Dolk, 17.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when I found out that they'd wear clothes, it was like,
yeah, because otherwise I'm not ready to handle that if they
didn't,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   If Shangri-La members and residents had any reservations about
intruders into their turf, they, too, found their fears unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good idea,'' said Dot Crane of Black Canyon City, as
she watched at least 60 children enjoying the pool Tuesday. ``It
opens us up so people can see we're not a bunch of freaks.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Kraus, financing swim lessons for the neighborhood
children barely cost him anything.
</P>
<P>
   . ``My biggest expense was to buy myself some swim trunks,''
said Kraus, who usually swims in the all-together.

LETTERS REPORTEDLY REVEAL RACIST SIDE OF ONE OF THREE SUSPECTS IN
TEXAS MURDER

<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ In a series of letters from prison that
frightened even his friends back home, one of three suspects in the
murder of a black man here proclaimed hatred for African-Americans
and allegiance to the Aryan Brotherhood, a relative of a
co-defendant said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd think they came straight from a magazine,'' said the
woman, who agreed to be interviewed on the condition that her
relationship to Shawn Berry be kept confidential. ``They were just
unbelievable, all about being racist, about hating black people,
`Hail to the brotherhood!' and all that stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The letters, she said, came from John William ``Bill'' King
while King was in a Texas prison for violating his parole on a
burglary charge. Berry had earlier served time for his role in the
same burglary.
</P>
<P>
   King and Berry, both 23, and Lawrence Brewer Jr., 31, now are
charged with the murder of James Byrd Jr., a black man allegedly
dragged by the ankles with a towing chain behind Berry's pickup for
nearly three miles early Sunday. Byrd's head and right arm were
ripped off in the attack that has generated national attention with
its savagery.
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit largely is based on statements by Berry, who was
arrested first. It implicates the two other men for actually
beating and killing Byrd.
</P>
<P>
   All of the suspects are white, and state and federal officials
suspect the crime was racially motivated. On Wednesday, they said
they hope to upgrade the charges so they can pursue the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, the the Rev. Jesse Jackson visited the small
East Texas timber town about 150 miles northeast of Houston and
urged reconciliation and unity among the races. As the crime
lingered in the spotlight, President Clinton and Texas Gov. George
W. Bush each condemned the slaying.
</P>
<P>
   And the search for answers continued.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Buentello, assistant director of the Texas prison system's
gang task force, said both King and Brewer had been monitored for
possible affiliation with the Ku Klux Klan and the Confederate
Knights of America, a skinhead group, while they were housed at the
Beto I Unit in Tennessee Colony in East Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Buentello said one of the men had been disciplined for
involvement in a 1995 racial disturbance between Anglos and
Hispanics at Beto. Prison records show that only King was in that
prison at that time.
</P>
<P>
   While at the Beto Unit, correspondence from King and Brewer was
monitored once officials there identified them as possible members
of racist groups. Guards also monitored which inmates they
associated with and their activities.
</P>
<P>
   But none of the three suspects was linked to membership in the
Aryan Brotherhood, one of the most violent gangs operating inside
the state prisons, Buentello added.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Aryan Brotherhood is a whole different ball game,'' he
said. ``The Aryan Brotherhood is a group that has caused extensive
problems ... all kinds of acts of violence, including deaths. It's
a very dangerous group.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither the KKK nor CKA is considered a violent prison gang
whose members must be segregated and sometimes placed in isolation
cells, Buentello said.
</P>
<P>
   He is awaiting photographs from Jasper County officials that
depict tattoos that could indicate gang affiliation. But even if
they do, Buentello said it is possible they were obtained outside
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of two prominent Klan groups in Texas have said they had
never heard of any of the suspects and were not aware of their
involvement in white supremacy activities.
</P>
<P>
   But before his release from prison last July, King wrote racist
letters to several people in the area, including some to a teen-age
girl whose parents were so disturbed by them that they called
prison officials to make him stop, Berry's relative said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were crazy letters,'' she said. ``It really scared
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The relative said King had long been known for making racist
jokes and remarks though she never knew of his acting on his
beliefs. She said she and Berry didn't take the letters seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill has always done the racial thing, and all that, but we
didn't believe he felt it in his heart,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to laugh about it ... not laugh because it was funny,
but we were just amazed he would say it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even that comes as a surprise to Deanna Tubb of nearby
Woodville, who knew King from elementary and high school and whose
family often took the young King with them to church in Jasper. She
eventually married a cousin of King's. Tubb on Wednesday recalled
King as a low-key youth, not so much shy as unassuming.
</P>
<P>
   She said King participated in ``all the normal hell-raising'' in
high school, drinking and such, but she never heard any racist
language or noticed any aggressive behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the last time she saw King a few months ago, after his
release from prison, she almost didn't recognize him. He was
bigger, of course, but he also sported tattoos up and down both
arms. Tubb didn't know what they meant.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I just noticed there were a lot of them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (King's father, Ronald King of Jasper, declined to speak with
the Houston Chronicle. In a brief written statement, he expressed
his sympathy for the victims and said, ``It hurts me deeply to know
that a boy I raised and considered to be the most loved boy I knew
could find it in himself to take a life.'')
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tubb disputed the contention of some city officials that Jasper
does not have racial problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The n-word is pretty common,'' she said. ``A lot of people say
that around here, even if they don't admit it.''
</P>
<P>
   Berry and King attended Jasper High School together in the
1990-91 school year, after which Berry transferred to Zavalla High
School in nearby Angelina County, Jasper school records show. King
attended Jasper High one more year, then the pair were arrested in
a Jasper County burglary.
</P>
<P>
   They were both sentenced to 10 years, but after a shock
probation ``boot camp'' in January 1993, Berry stayed out of
prison, Texas Department of Criminal Justice records show. King
also was given shock probation, and in January 1994 his academic
records were sent to Vidor High School, though it was unclear
whether he attended classes there.
</P>
<P>
   He was sent back to prison in June 1995 as a parole violator.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and family warned Berry not to hang around King when he
was released from prison last July, the relative said. But, she
said, Berry was ``easily influenced'' and felt King had
``changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the relative and another older female relation, who also
would talk only if promised anonymity, said they had never met or
seen the third suspect, Brewer.
</P>
<P>
   The younger relative said Berry ``got in a fight or two'' and
got depressed now and then but was well-known in town, an outgoing
and likable young man who loved rodeo bull riding.
</P>
<P>
   The older woman said Berry had never known his father and had
some behavioral problems. But, she said, he was kind-hearted and a
hard worker who did everything from timber work to clearing fields
and mowing yards to working in the local theater box office.
</P>
<P>
   And, she said, he is not a racist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shawn is not a prejudiced young man,'' she said. ``Red,
yellow, black or white, it made no difference to him. ... He is not
a monster.''
</P>
<P>
   Berry's testimony in the affidavit states that he had offered
Byrd a ride in his pickup, which upset King, who cursed and shouted
racial epithets. He says that after the group stopped at a
convenience store, King took the wheel and drove into a remote
area.
</P>
<P>
   Berry also claims in the police statement that he ran a short
distance away when King and Berry first started beating Byrd but
King drove after him. He also says he asked King to let him out of
the truck while Byrd was being dragged on a chain, but that King
replied, ``You're just as guilty as we are. Besides, the same thing
could happen to a n-----lover.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know with all my heart that Shawn wasn't involved with the
actual murder, in the hate,'' the younger relative said, ``but
there's no excuse for it no matter.''

VALLONE INTRODUCES STADIUM REFERENDUM BILL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By NORIMITSU ONISHI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Following through on a pledge that has contributed
significantly to his current budget battle with Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, Peter Vallone, the City Council speaker, introduced a
bill Wednesday that would put a referendum about the future of
Yankee Stadium on the November ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Accusing Giuliani of not caring about the opinion of ordinary
New Yorkers, Vallone said he wanted voters to decide whether
government money should be used to help build a new ballpark for
the Yankees in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The taxpayers of this city have every right to say, `Yes, I
want a new stadium in Manhattan,' or, `No, I want the Bronx Bombers
to stay in the Bronx,''' Vallone said at a news conference. ``That,
ladies and gentlemen, is what democracy is about.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giuliani administration immediately attacked the bill,
saying it was driven by the political ambitions of the speaker, who
is seeking the Democratic nomination for governor. The
administration also said the referendum would handcuff the city in
its negotiations with the Yankees. The team's principal owner,
George Steinbrenner III, said last week that Vallone's referendum
plan had pushed him to the edge of moving the team out of New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics and leadership in politics requires a certain degree
of wisdom, and not just pandering constantly to what public opinion
polls tell you,'' Giuliani said Wednesday at a news conference,
adding that a referendum would likely increase the Democratic voter
turnout for Vallone in the general election in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the calculation was he felt he would get 100,000 more
votes if he put this on the ballot,'' Giuliani said. ``So to create
a difficult problem in a very sensitive negotiation, which this
will no doubt do, for a city that has had a terrible record of
keeping sports teams, just in order to get yourself 100,000 votes
on the ballot, seems to me the wrong thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The referendum bill is considered certain to become law, because
Vallone has tight control over the Democratic-dominated council.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker introduced the bill as Giuliani vetoed more than
$196 million from a budget that the council passed on Friday in
defiance of the mayor. The budget negotiations collapsed last week,
in part because of the political impasse between the mayor and the
speaker over the Yankee Stadium issue. The Giuliani administration
has insisted that it will not agree to a budget unless Vallone
drops his plans for a referendum.
</P>
<P>
   The deadlock caused the council to pass a budget without the
mayor's agreement for the first time since it acquired the
authority to do so under the 1989 city charter revision.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the budget implications raised by the referendum,
Giuliani and Vallone have starkly different views of where a new
Yankee Stadium should be and how to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor is trying to block Vallone's proposal from appearing
on the ballot this fall by creating a special commission to
recommend changes to the city charter. By state law, a charter
question takes precedence over all other ballot questions, and
would block the Yankee Stadium issue from being considered this
year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Vallone camp, in turn, is also helping a grass-roots
organization gather enough signatures in a petition drive intended
to put the stadium question on the ballot. If the group gathers
30,000 signatures, the question would be put before the voters
separately from the referendum called for by Vallone's bill, but a
charter commission initiative would knock both questions off the
ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The referendum fight began after a half-ton steel beam fell on a
section of Yankee Stadium seats in April. The mayor revived a
proposal to build a stadium on the West Side of Manhattan, a
project that by some estimates could run as high as a $1 billion.
Giuliani said he wanted the team to stay in the Bronx, but a new
stadium was needed to keep the team profitable, and eliminating the
option of Manhattan could push Steinbrenner to New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that a stadium in Manhattan would require both public and
private money, the mayor proposed extending a commercial rent tax
that he had previously sought to abolish, a tax scheduled to expire
in 2001 that would raise at least $600 million.
</P>
<P>
   But while Vallone said officials should study the possibility of
using public funds to help build a new stadium, he added that the
stadium should stay in the Bronx. He said moving the team out of
the Bronx would be an economic disaster for that borough and
financing a Manhattan stadium would be an undeserved gift to
Steinbrenner, whose ball club has earned him millions.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker proposed letting the voters decide the issue by
having the council put a referendum on the November ballot. And
members of his gubernatorial campaign are helping the grass-roots
organization _ Keep the Yankees in the Bronx _ in its separate
petition drive to put the stadium question on the ballot, Peter
Ragone, a spokesman for Vallone, said.
</P>
<P>
   By pushing for a referendum, Vallone is likely to derive
substantial benefits in his drive to challenge Gov. George Pataki
in the fall. In addition to increasing his name recognition,
Vallone, if he gets his referendum on the ballot, could drive up
voter turnout in Democratic strongholds like Manhattan and the
Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   In a defensive move, the mayor created a City Charter Revision
Commission to place a question on the November ballot. Under the
arcane rules governing the city charter and the state's Municipal
Home Rule Law, a charter question would bump from the ballot any
other referendum questions, either from the council or from a
petition drive, said Eric Lane, the executive director of the 1989
Charter Revision Commission.
</P>
<P>
   But because charter revision commissions were set up in the past
to review the fundamental workings of city government, Vallone's
aides said they are hoping to prevent Giuliani's commission from
putting a question on the ballot, possibly by arguing in court that
the question is not a serious one but merely an attempt to block
the stadium referendum.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be legal and governmental reasons why the mayor's
charter commission won't be able to put its proposal on the
ballot,'' said Richard Weinberg, the council's general counsel. &QL;

RANKS OF CANDIDATES TO HEAD UNIVERSITY ARE THINNING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.M., Calif., W.Va., Ala.)  (lb) 
 By KAREN W. ARENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Five months after a search committee began looking
for someone to replace the former chancellor of the City University
of New York, strong candidates have declined even to consider the
job, because of the divisive political battles surrounding the
institution _ leaving a pool of early contenders that some trustees
call unimpressive.
 &UR;  &LR; Stephen Trachtenberg, president of George Washington University,
who said he discussed the job with the search firm working with the
CUNY committee but was not ready to move, said the perception among
many academics was that ``decisions are being made politically.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The role of the mayor and the governor and the trustees would
seem to be more robust than one would expect, and that diminishes
the role of the chancellor,'' he said. ``I have a different kind of
board that lets me be president. If I succeed, they pat me on the
head. If I don't, they kick me in the pants. But they are not
constantly pulling up the plant to see how the roots are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Nichols, a partner at Heidrick &AMP; Struggles, the executive
search firm that has been working with CUNY to find a permanent
replacement for its former chancellor, Ann Reynolds, would not say
how many candidates she had called or discuss any names.
</P>
<P>
   But she said politics have complicated the search. In recent
months, CUNY has drawn harsh criticism from Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
and Gov. George Pataki over remedial studies and standards that
they call lax.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the whole remedial issue, and the fact that it was in
the paper every day, didn't make the job easier,'' Ms. Nichols
said. ``But it ensures that we won't be talking to people who will
be politically naive about the job.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee, which is headed by Anne Paolucci, CUNY's
chairwoman, and includes trustees, faculty and students, began to
interview candidates this week. Ms. Nichols said the ``tough
search'' was still in its early stages, adding that she was
committed to helping the board have ``rich choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Although other educators contacted about the position in recent
months declined to discuss their conversations, some said they
shared Trachtenberg's concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York is impossible right now, and I think the real quality
people will feel that way,'' said one college president who was
approached about the CUNY job but declined to be considered. He
talked only on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone understands that a board has the right and the
responsibility to set policy,'' he said. ``The question is whether
this board has moved beyond policy to the results.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   CUNY-bashing has become a political and public spectacle in
recent months, with Giuliani leading the way. Since his re-election
in November, he has often attacked CUNY and has suggested that
private universities or companies would do a better job educating
students.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, as CUNY's trustees tried to find a way to improve
remedial education, the mayor told his appointees on the board that
they should hold out for a measure that totally removed remedial
students from the university's bachelor degree programs _ a measure
that he and the governor helped shape and that the board adopted
last month.
</P>
<P>
   Other trustees railed against political interference, saying
they had not seen anything like it before.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone saw politics as a barrier to finding a good
chancellor. Some education officials say that political involvement
is a fact of life and should not necessarily frighten away
candidates. ``This is not so sui generis, although it seems that
way because a couple of issues have cropped up,'' said Sheldon
Steinbach, general counsel for the American Council on Education in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   As of early this week, there were about half a dozen names on
the search committee's working list, including Richard Ekman, the
secretary of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, and Ronald Shelp, the
former president of the New York City Partnership, according to
people close to the search committee.
</P>
<P>
   These people said the educators on the list had experience in
public higher education, but not with large urban universities like
CUNY. They include William C. Gordon, the provost at the University
of New Mexico; Theodore R. Mitchell, a vice chancellor at the
University of California at Los Angeles; Charles W. Manning,
chancellor of the University System of West Virginia, and Fred
Gainous, chancellor of Alabama's community college system.

EDITORIAL: TIME TO MUSCLE STATE PULLUTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, June 11:
</P>
<P>
   In late 1996, a fed-up Carol Browner fined Smithfield Foods $125
million for dumping hog wastes into a Virginia river. It was the
biggest penalty ever levied by an administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency, and Smithfield was not the only
target. It was also a rebuke to Virginia, which had failed to
control Smithfield's behavior, and a warning to all other states
that were not enforcing federal environmental laws.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Browner's message has not been clearly heard. A recent
sampling of states by her own internal auditors suggests widespread
failure by local officials _ and in some cases by regional EPA
officials _ to police the nation's clean-air and clean-water laws.
New Mexico, for example, failed to inspect about half its major air
polluters from 1990 to 1996. Bad-faith actions by the states could
undermine the administration's good-faith efforts to give them more
flexibility in carrying out the laws. Also, states that flout the
law could become ``pollution havens'' for companies seeking to
escape environmental costs, causing a shift in jobs from states
that enforce the law.
</P>
<P>
   Under present arrangements, Washington sets the rules of the
road _ detailed regulations governing the levels of pollutants that
can be discharged into the air and water. The states are
responsible for inspection and enforcement. As a practical matter,
this is the best way to administer the law. The task of monitoring
hundreds of thousands of potential polluters nationwide is clearly
beyond Washington's ability. But Ms. Browner can pressure the
states if she wants to, tightening federal oversight and denying
vital grant money to states that fail. In extreme cases, she can
take control of a state's entire anti-pollution strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ms. Browner needs to come down hard on some of her
own people. The audits uncovered serious violations in several
states where, for various reasons, the EPA has not delegated
enforcement responsibilities. The situation is particularly grave
in the Pacific Northwest, where the agency's Seattle office governs
anti-pollution efforts in states like Idaho and Alaska that have
long been hostile to any kind of environmental regulation. In
Idaho, for example, factories and cities have been systematically
dumping sewage into the Boise River, right under the EPA's nose.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Ms. Browner has been reluctant to intervene with
the states, in part because she thinks a cooperative approach works
best. In addition, the EPA has long been a convenient target for
conservative politicians, and in many states is no more popular
than the Internal Revenue Service. But as Ms. Browner knows, this
is not a popularity contest. The administration, not to mention
Vice President Al Gore's reputation as an environmentalist, can
only suffer if it fails to bring ornery states into line. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ Like breezes off the Hudson River a few feet away,
new theories and fads in child welfare tend to blow through the
rolling campus of Leake and Watts Services every few decades,
ruffling the paperwork. Families should be preserved at all cost.
No, abusive families must be split up. Neglected children should
live together in a bucolic country setting. No, they should stay in
the neighborhood where they grew up.
</P>
<P>
   What hasn't changed much are the needs of the children
themselves. Since 1831, Irish, Polish, Italian and, more recently,
black and Hispanic children who could not or should not live with
their parents have depended on Leake and Watts to look after their
health, to straighten their lives, to guide them into adult
society.
</P>
<P>
   James Campbell, the nonprofit agency's executive director, has
helped lead them through the crises of AIDS and crack over the last
22 years, but an institution this old remembers far greater
upheavals in the lives of children: the Irish potato famine, the
Civil War, the Great Depression, the world wars.
</P>
<P>
   Given those 167 years of history, a new directive from City Hall
last week that once again rethinks the administration of child
welfare in New York City is not exactly shaking the foundations of
Leake and Watts, whose campus on the Bronx-Yonkers border was
designed by Frederick Law Olmsted back in the days when an ``orphan
asylum'' was a welcoming refuge from the horrors of 19th-century
life.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, like most people in the world of child welfare, says
his agency welcomes the changes toward more neighborhood-based
care, and he believes his staff is prepared for them. His response
demonstrates why, paradoxically, it may be some of the city's most
venerable institutions that possess the flexibility to weather
these moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's a good idea, it will evolve and have its place,'' he
said this week, sitting in the Gothic main building that used to
house orphans in long, dormitory-style wards. ``When these places
got started, they called them asylums, and children were
indentured. Now we look back and say, `My God, that's awful.' Well
it wasn't awful at the time. Life was brutal at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Leake and Watts is one of a handful of social-service agencies
that arose from the industrialization of New York in the 19th
century that continue to dominate child welfare in the city,
matching children to foster parents, boarding children who cannot
be placed, and working with troubled families to reduce the need
for foster care.
</P>
<P>
   The agency was founded by John Watts, the last royal recorder of
New York City under British rule and a member of Congress, using
money from the estate of his brother-in-law, John George Leake, son
of the British commissary for stores during the French and Indian
Wars. Currently it serves some 2,500 children a year, about 95
percent of whom are black or Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, 61, a former Roman Catholic priest from Philadelphia
whose parents were Irish immigrants, is a bit of a departure from
the High Protestant churchmen who made Leake and Watts the epitome
of establishment noblesse oblige. (An 1848 cornerstone lists as
trustees the rector of Trinity Church and the senior ministers of
the Reformed Protestant Dutch Church and the Presbyterian Churches,
along with such names as Mayor Robert Morris and James Roosevelt,
the founder of Roosevelt Hospital.)
</P>
<P>
   He studied social work at Fordham University on orders from his
bishop and eventually ran Catholic Charities in Philadelphia before
leaving the priesthood and working for New York City's Child
Welfare Administration in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   His work running the Children's Center _ one of the city's least
successful efforts to gather children under one roof _ which was
closed in 1977, helped convince him that child welfare required a
much broader approach than the old-line agencies had traditionally
provided. After joining Leake and Watts, Campbell helped develop
one of the first programs for foster children with HIV., and began
to focus the agency's efforts almost exclusively on the Bronx,
where it opened several group homes, a family services center and
various Head Start and day care programs. It also established
alliances with Bronx community service groups like Banana Kelly and
Unitas.
</P>
<P>
   The concentration on one borough was prescient, because the
Giuliani administration's new proposal requires agencies to create
neighborhood-based networks in order to keep children in their
communities and bring foster families into regular contact with
their children's parents.
</P>
<P>
   John Courtney, a contributing editor of Child Welfare Watch,
said: ``They've been concentrating on the Bronx for some time, and
I think the city's new decentralization and community-based
approach should fit in comfortably with their structure. Other
agencies with a more citywide scope could have a more difficult
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, whose agency is the fourth largest of the 38 agencies
that contract with the city for foster care work, receiving about
$26 million a year in city money, says that while he's a bit
worried about the new applications to fill out, he has learned not
to be terribly surprised by any new idea that comes along.
</P>
<P>
   ``They call us traditional and established and all of those
things, but it's not like we haven't come up with a few new ideas
of our own over the years,'' he said. ``People who work in places
like this, who've been doing it for a long time, have a certain
accumulated knowledge.'' &QL;

TRENDY KOO KOO ROO CHICKEN CHAIN TO JOIN FAMILY FLOCK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The parent company of Chi-Chi's and El Torito
restaurants is buying Koo Koo Roo Inc. for $158.3 million in stock
and assumed debt, the companies announced.
</P>
<P>
   The beleaguered Santa Monica-based chicken restaurant chain will
merge with privately held Family Restaurants Inc. of Irvine to form
Koo Koo Roo Enterprises Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, announced Wednesday, Koo Koo Roo shareholders
will exchange one common share for one share of stock from the new
company, giving them a 33 percent stake. The acquisition is
expected to close in 60 to 90 days, with the new company retaining
Koo Koo Roo's ticker symbol, KKRO.
</P>
<P>
   The new company will control 325 restaurants in 31 states and 11
foreign countries. No restaurants will be closed as a result of the
acquisition, and any potential layoffs will come from corporate
offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting a great concept that has tremendous potential
for growth, in our opinion,'' said Kevin Relyea, chairman,
president and chief executive officer of Family Restaurants, who
will retain the same position at the new company. ``We believe that
Koo Koo Roo's proven that customers love the product.''
</P>
<P>
   William Allen, CEO of Koo Koo Roo, who will become a director of
the new company, said the chicken chain explored alternatives that
included borrowing more money or issuing more shares to raise
capital for growth. In the end, finding a buyer was the better
option, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Family Restaurants) was clearly the best partner for us,''
Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the merger agreement, Family Restaurants also
provided a $3 million loan to Koo Koo Roo, agreed to issue senior
debt for net proceeds of $21 million and will expand its existing
credit line by an additional $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   Koo Koo Roo acting Chairman Lee Iacocca will join the new
company's board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Iacocca calls the marriage ``an ideal strategic
fit,'' saying both companies will benefit by combining purchasing
power and administrative support.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts questioned the viability of the deal, given Family
Restaurants' current financial problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Family Restaurants had enough on its plate turning
around its own restaurants,'' said Mike Rowan, a senior analyst at
Moody's, a New York bond-rating agency. ``It's a highly leveraged
company. Its cash flow is barely meeting interest obligations. It
has pretty weak credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Moody's rated its bonds Caa2, which is ``deep junk'' and signals
a ``high potential of default'' within 18 to 24 months, Rowan said.
</P>
<P>
   Standard &AMP; Poor's, another New York bond-rating agency, rated
Family Restaurants' debt at CCC+ -- bonds of poor standing with a
negative outlook.
</P>
<P>
   Rowan said what's also troubling is that Family Restaurants
carries $200 million in long-term debt, which exceeds the total
value of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Chi-Chi's sites -- which generate more than half the company's
revenues -- only broke even for the first time last year, Rowan
said, based on EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization. The El Torito unit is profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Family Restaurants had $462 million in revenues and an EBITDA of
$18.4 million for the 12 months ended March 31. Over the same
period, Koo Koo Roo's revenues were $79.5 million with an EBITDA
loss of $22.7 million, which included $20.6 million in
restructuring and other charges.
</P>
<P>
   Koo Koo Roo, known for its flame-broiled chicken and fancy side
dishes, has not made money since at least 1993. While overall
revenue continued to rise -- from $5.8 million in 1993 -- losses
mounted yearly as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company, over the last several years, has accessed an
awful lot of capital and not employed that capital very
effectively,'' Allen said. ``We got into noncore businesses, as
well as hopscotching around the map opening up some stand-alone
units in outlying markets.''
</P>
<P>
   In March, the chicken chain appointed Iacocca, 73, a shareholder
and former Chrysler chairman, as its acting chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Iacocca took over in the midst of a company restructuring that
included the layoffs of some corporate employees and closures of
underperforming restaurants. Koo Koo Roo is seeking a buyer for
Color Me Mine, a ceramics painting chain it purchased in 1996. It
also has cut overhead by $8 million to $9 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Koo Koo Roo shares lost 7/16 to close at 2 7/16 on heavy trading
of 3.2 million shares, up 33 percent from its three-month average
daily volume.

SCIENTISTS CRACK GENETIC CODE OF TUBERCULOSIS BACTERIUM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Corrects spelling style of Sanger Center, sted Centre
throughout. Changes `fund' and `funding' to `finance' and
`financing' in 14th, 15th and 16th grafs.) (th) 
 By NICHOLAS WADE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists have broken the code of the tuberculosis bacterium, a
germ that kills more people in the world than any other infectious
agent.
</P>
<P>
   The advance, which is being published Thursday in the journal
Nature, is the work of a team led by Dr. Stewart Cole, a
tuberculosis expert at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, and Dr. Bart
Barrell, a DNA sequencer at the Sanger Center near Cambridge,
England.
</P>
<P>
   The team succeeded in decoding the 4,411,529 chemical letters
that constitute the genome, or DNA sequence, of Mycobacterium
tuberculosis, as the microbe is known. Working out the structure of
so enormous an DNA molecule lies at the edge of what is technically
possible. About a dozen bacterial genomes have been sequenced since
1995, only one of them larger than that of tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
   This advance is likely to open up new approaches for developing
drugs and vaccines against the microbe, and to reinvigorate
research efforts in what has been up to now a difficult and slow
moving field.
</P>
<P>
   The success comes none too soon. Tuberculosis is a deadly
disease in the less developed world, killing three million people a
year, according to the World Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, where it has long been treatable with
antibiotics, public health officials were concerned when
drug-resistant strains emerged several years ago that the disease
would become uncontrollable again. The outbreak of these novel
forms has been contained, but tuberculosis is no longer regarded
with complacency.
</P>
<P>
   The bacterium is inhaled and is usually contained within the
lungs by the body's immune system. There it may lurk harmlessly for
years, until the immune system is weakened by age, stress or
disease. Then the bacterium erupts, eating through the tissues of
the lungs and occasional blood vessels, making the patient cough up
alarming displays of blood.
</P>
<P>
   Possession of the bacterium's DNA sequence is like acquiring an
enemy's battle plan. The sequence encodes every genetic defense and
stratagem the bacterium has acquired in the course of evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Though full analysis of the sequence will take years, the
Pasteur-Sanger Center team has already discerned that the sequence
encodes about 4,000 separate genes and has divined how some of them
may assist the microbe at different stages of its cunning life
cycle.
</P>
<P>
   About 400 of these genes, for example, belong to a previously
unrecognized genetic family. Their purpose may be to help the
bacterium change its outer coat, staying one step ahead of the
attacks mounted against it by the body's immune system.
</P>
<P>
   Another large set of genes is devoted to making fat-related
chemicals known as lipids. These may be the key to sealing the
bacterium's membrane and enabling it to survive for years while it
waits for a weak spot to emerge in the immune system's defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Barry Bloom, a tuberculosis expert at the Albert Einstein
College of Medicine in the Bronx, said the genome would have ``a
major effect in accelerating ongoing work in terms of identifying
the genes required for virulence and targets for drugs and
vaccines.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lee Reichman, director of the National Tuberculosis Center
in Newark, N.J., said he hoped the genome would stimulate drug
companies to devise less draconian ways of treating the disease
than the present six months of intensive drug therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bloom and Reichman have been critical of the lack of public
financing for tuberculosis research and believe that availability
of the genome will bring new zest to the field.
</P>
<P>
   But even the genome sequencing project looked for a time as if
it would be another fumble with two rival teams duplicating each
other's work. The Wellcome Trust, a large medical philanthropy in
London, decided to finance the Sanger Center team to sequence the
tuberculosis genome starting in March 1996.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later the National Institutes of Health, which had
been unsuccessful in an earlier attempt, approved financing for the
Institute of Genomic Research in Rockville, Md., to also sequence
the tuberculosis genome. The institute's director, Dr. J. Craig
Venter, was the first to sequence a bacterial genome in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Claire Fraser, the institute's vice president for research,
said the NIH decided to go ahead ``since the Wellcome Trust hadn't
completed a genome and the NIH didn't want to put their eggs in
another failed basket, as it were.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sanger Center has won the race since the Institute of
Genomic Research is a month away from closing the gaps in its
sequence and then has further checking to do.
</P>
<P>
   Barrell, asked how he felt to have beaten the usually very
competitive Venter, said diplomatically that he was happy to finish
first ``but coming in second is sometimes a bigger prize because
you can make all the comparisons,'' meaning that the differences
between the two laboratories sequences will be of high scientific
interest.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid direct duplication, the two teams chose to study
different strains of the tuberculosis bacterium. The Sanger Center
chose a strain that has been studied in the laboratory for many
years, while the Institute for Genomic Research picked an unusually
infectious strain that had recently caused an outbreak in a
children's clothing factory in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   A worker with the strain infected most of his family members and
many of his fellow workers, despite the most casual contact with
them.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser said that the two strains were proving to be very
different, with changes in every 5,000 units of DNA on average.
Since the clothing factory strain is highly infectious and the
laboratory strain is not, the differences between the two genomes
should help pinpoint exactly which genes account for the
infectivity.
</P>
<P>
   Barrell and Fraser both said the tuberculosis genome had proved
particularly hard to sequence, in part because of the many regions
in which the same string of chemical letters is repeated. These
repetitive strings have the higher purpose of protecting the
bacterium against its host's immune system.
</P>
<P>
   Repetitive DNA confuses the machinery that translates genetic
instructions into proteins. Since the repetitive regions seem to be
in the genes for the bacterium's coat proteins, the effect is to
change the composition of the coat at regular intervals. The coat
proteins are the target of the body's immune system, which is
thrown into disarray each time the target shifts.
</P>
<P>
   The tuberculosis strain that infects humans seems to have split
away some 10,000 years ago from the strain that infects cattle.
Since this is about the time that cattle were domesticated, the
human disease can be seen as a consequence of that agricultural
revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Plans are under way to sequence the cattle version of
tuberculosis, as well as another closely related bacterium, which
causes human leprosy. &QL;

JACKSON BRINGS MESSAGE OF RECONCILIATION TO REELING TEXAS TOWN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RICHARD STEWART 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ As the Rev. Jesse Jackson brought a message of
reconciliation to this community reeling from a brutal murder,
local and federal authorities said they hope to get the death
penalty for two of the three white men accused of dragging a black
man behind a pickup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a new Jasper,'' Jackson told an overflow crowd of more
than 200 inside the Greater New Bethel Baptist Church as at least
that many more waited outside. The audience was overwhelmingly
black.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must not tolerate hate on either side of town. I see a new
Jasper, a new heaven and new Earth where all of our children can
walk in peace together.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said he came at the invitation of the family of James
Byrd Jr., who was killed early Sunday. He had been beaten, then
chained to a pickup by his ankles and dragged for almost three
miles along back country roads. His head and right arm were severed
from his body.
</P>
<P>
   The crime has shocked the nation, drawing statements of outrage
from President Clinton and Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said only religion can cure such sickness as the one that
killed Byrd, whose suspected attackers have ties to racist hate
groups. Clinton called upon the residents of Jasper to ``join
together across racial lines to demonstrate that an act of evil
like this is not what this country is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This family is hurting,'' Jackson told his church audience. He
said he plans to return Saturday for Byrd's funeral. He also said
that pro basketball player Dennis Rodman of the Chicago Bulls has
offered to pay for Byrd's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Don Clark, special agent in charge of the Houston FBI office,
said Wednesday that it is likely the slaying will be prosecuted as
a federal hate crime and civil rights case, making it possible to
seek a death sentence. But that decision may not be made for a
month.
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney for Jasper County also plans to pursue
state capital murder charges. The maximum punishment for the charge
of murder is life in prison. Conviction for capital murder can mean
life in prison or death by injection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We clearly have a murder and it is clearly a hate crime,''
District Attorney Guy James Gray said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pretty well satisfied that this deserves to be a
capital case,'' he said. ``We have three people here and we may
have to back off on one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the three white men accused in Byrd's &UR;  &LR; slaying gave
investigators a detailed account of the crime. That suspect, Shawn
Berry, 23, of Jasper, contends he had no role in the beating or
slaying. However, for the time being, he has been charged with
murder along with his companions, 23-year-old John William ``Bill''
King, also of Jasper, and 31-year-old Lawrence Brewer Jr. of
Sulphur Springs.
</P>
<P>
   Gray said Berry has been the most cooperative of the three
defendants and the only one who has shown signs of remorse.
</P>
<P>
   Under Texas law, a capital charge can be sought if a murder is
committed along with another felony. Gray said investigators are
now trying to make a case that Byrd was kidnapped.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he said his office is awaiting forensic evidence
before upgrading the charges, and it may take three weeks for a
crime laboratory to process it.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Denney, death investigator for the district attorney's
office, said the final autopsy was not complete. However, he said,
Byrd may have been unconscious but was alive when a towing chain
was put around his ankles and he was dragged from Berry's pickup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt very much that he could stay alive very long being
dragged down an asphalt road,'' Denney said, explaining that it may
be impossible to determine exactly at what point Byrd died.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement to investigators, Berry said Byrd was dragged
behind the truck along a twisting, hilly blacktopped road for
almost three miles.
</P>
<P>
   The three suspects, who remain in the county jail, will probably
be indicted after a new grand jury goes into session in July, Gray
said. All three have asked for court-appointed attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   Gray said that while he expects defense attorneys to seek a
change of venue to have the men tried elsewhere, ``this thing has
gotten plenty of publicity all over the state. I think we could try
it here just as well as anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said Byrd's slaying poses a character test for Jasper.
``That you have not extended the violence is a good sign.''
</P>
<P>
   The test, he said, will be to see if the shock felt by both
black and white Jasper residents can be the catalyst for finding
new ways for different parts of the community to work together.
</P>
<P>
   He said that when he arrived at the home of Byrd's parents
Wednesday afternoon, he was met by a line of both white and black
ministers. He also noted that Jasper's black mayor and white
sheriff seem to be working together during the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``God has an amazing way of doing great things through small
towns,'' Jackson said, noting that Jesus was born in a small town
and Rosa Parks did not stand up against racism in New York but in
Montgomery, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Using Byrd's boyhood nickname, he said, ``Just maybe Toe Byrd
has become a mark of a new day.''

LOW-COST METROCARD MIGHT BE SOLD ONLY TO TOURISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fearing that the planned one-day, unlimited bus and
subway Metrocard is priced so low that it could be a big
money-loser, city transit officials want to sell the $4 pass only
at hotels and other tourist spots, according to an official who has
worked on developing the passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't be able to walk up to a token clerk and ask for
it,'' said the transit official, who spoke only on condition of
anonymity, adding that the move was expressly intended to suppress
sales. ``Essentially, this is a way to make the 24-hour pass a
rational part of the unlimited-ride program. Otherwise we'd be
selling humongous numbers of 24-hour cards.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan, the official said, is being pushed by New York City
Transit, which runs the buses and subways, and would have to be
approved by Transit's parent agency, the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority.
</P>
<P>
   The MTA executive in charge of Metrocards, Christopher Boylan,
was not available to comment Wednesday, and a spokesman, Tom Kelly,
would not discuss the finances or the availability of the day
passes, which are expected to be offered this fall. A spokesman for
Gov. George Pataki, the driving force behind the passes, said plans
for the day passes were ``still subject to all kinds of changes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our focus is more on the monthly and weekly passes at this
point,'' said the governor's spokesman, Michael McKeon. The MTA
plans to offer monthly Metrocards for $63 and weekly cards for $17
starting July 4. Transit officials have said that they expect the
entire package of daily, weekly and monthly passes to add 100
million rides a year to the system and cost the agency more than
$200 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   McKeon said that the day pass, known as the Fun Pass, had been
intended all along to be primarily for tourists. And indeed, when
the governor announced the pass last December, he said it was
``largely aimed at people, whether they're tourists or visitors to
New York for a period of days, who will be able to go downtown and
see the Statue of Liberty, go uptown and see Yankee Stadium or the
Bronx Zoo, go over to Shea Stadium or take a crosstown bus to the
revitalized Times Square to see the theater, all for only $4.''
</P>
<P>
   But advocates for riders said they had assumed that a family
from, say, Queens, would not have to make a side trip to the
Waldorf-Astoria before beginning a day of sightseeing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the governor announced the one-day Fun Pass, he didn't
say that only tourists would have fun,'' said Gene Russianoff,
staff lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The transit official speaking on condition of anonymity said the
agency was worried that commuters could find the pass _ priced at
less than the cost of three rides _ all too convenient for
occasional transit splurges.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you used it at 8:30 Tuesday morning, you could use it again
at 8:15 Wednesday morning,'' he said. In that case, any trips in
addition to the ride home Tuesday night would be effectively free.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had made it so that there were restrictions _ that you
could only use it after 9:30 a.m., or if you priced it at $6, it
would be OK,'' the official said. ``But at $4 it's not part of any
rational price structure.'' The prices for the monthly, weekly and
daily passes were ``set by the governor in a decision process that
nobody can discern,'' the official said. ``It just happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Sigall, the Associate Director of the Permanent
Citizens Advisory Committee to the MTA, a monitoring group, said he
hoped the agency would reconsider its marketing plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree that $4 is a very generous price for the one-day pass,
and I certainly understand their concerns about losing a lot of
money,'' he said. ``But the way the governor proposed this is that
it would be available to everybody.''

EDITORIAL: PUNISHING COMPETENCE AT THE FEC 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, June 11:
</P>
<P>
   At a time when Congress should be moving aggressively to
strengthen the Federal Election Commission's ability to enforce the
nation's campaign finance laws, House Republicans are racing
headlong in the opposite direction.
</P>
<P>
   The FEC remains hampered by an inadequate budget, and by a
commission structure (three members from each party) that tends
toward gridlock. Now a move is afoot to get rid of the agency's
evenhanded general counsel, Lawrence Noble, in retaliation for his
attempts to enforce the law as written. He is pressing the
commission to use its existing powers to bar the huge
``soft-money'' contributions that have corrupted federal campaigns.
He has pursued lawsuits against groups like GOPAC and the Christian
Coalition for alleged rules violations. The Republican leadership
is not happy.
</P>
<P>
   Last month the House Oversight Committee approved a measure
proposed by its chairman, Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., taking aim at
Noble without mentioning his name. Currently, it takes a vote by
four members of the commission to appoint or remove a general
counsel or staff director. Thomas' bill would require reappointment
to these posts every four years, beginning next year, thereby
setting the stage for a Republican coup ousting Noble. The change
is nothing more than an attempt to install a do-nothing enforcement
staff. Given Attorney General Janet Reno's lax approach to campaign
law, a crippled FEC would guarantee an open field for
influence-peddlers and influence-buyers.
</P>
<P>
   A House Appropriations subcommittee is expected to take up this
mischievous measure Thursday, with an eye toward adding it as a
rider to the Treasury appropriations bill. Reform-minded members
from both parties have a duty to oppose this vendetta. President
Clinton, meanwhile, who could stand a better image on soft money,
needs to make clear that he considers it veto bait.

 &HT;    Three suspects held without bond in Texas mureder
 &HT;    By Mitch Mitchell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ Authorities in the small East Texas town of
Jasper said those guilty in the gruesome slaying of a 49-year-old
black man deserve to be charged with the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Those same authorities asked that their own town not be judged
guilty by association.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our opinion that this horrible crime warrants a capital
offense,'' Jasper County Sheriff Billy Rowles said.
</P>
<P>
   James Byrd Jr.'s body was found on a dirt road Sunday about five
miles east of Jasper. Byrd was beaten into unconsciousness, tied
with a chain to the rear of a pickup truck, then dragged behind the
truck for three miles.
</P>
<P>
   His head, neck and right arm were ripped away from his body
during the murder. His face was shredded beyond recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Russell Brewer, 31, of Sulphur Springs, Texas, and
Shawn Allen Berry and John William King, both 23 and both of
Jasper, have been charged with murder in the slaying and are being
held without bond in the Jasper County Jail.
</P>
<P>
   Jasper County District Attorney Guy James Gray said murder
charges could be upgraded to federal charges or capital charges,
but it may take anywhere from a few days to three weeks before
those charges can be filed.
</P>
<P>
   Murder charges carry a maximum sentence of life in prison, while
conviction on a capital murder charge can be punished by life in
prison or death by lethal injection.
</P>
<P>
   Gray explained that, before capital murder charges or federal
charges under the hate crime statute can be brought, strict legal
criteria must be met.
</P>
<P>
   Hate crimes must also have a violation of civil rights component
and Texas law requires a murder to be committed while in commission
of another felony to warrant capital crime status in this case,
Gray explained.
</P>
<P>
   Gray said investigators are pursuing a kidnapping angle and
federal agents are wrestling with the violation of civil rights
aspect of the crime.
</P>
<P>
   The state may have to offer one suspect a plea bargain agreement
in order to pursue upgraded charges with the other two suspects,
but Gray said the state has not reached that point yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, we have three people here and we might have to back
off one to establish the facts in the case,'' Gray said. ``We're
not ready right now to make that call.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray said it is evident that the murder was a hate crime. King,
Berry and Brewer are suspected of having connections to white
supremacist groups and two have tattoos that have been linked to
the Aryan Nation, a white racist prison gang, Rowles said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the suspects also owned a lighter with a triangular
symbol identified as a sign of the Ku Klux Klan.
</P>
<P>
   In a sworn affidavit Berry said King referred to the ``Turner
Diaries,'' a book read believed to espouse white supremist ideas.
</P>
<P>
   All through Berry's statement, he referred to racial comments
and derogatory references made toward Byrd as King and Brewer
allegedly beat Byrd, then tore his body to pieces, leaving him dead
at the end of a bloody three-mile trail.
</P>
<P>
   Rowles took the last few minutes of a Wednesday press conference
in Jasper to say that most of the people in Jasper are good,
hard-working people. He asked that the world not brand the
community because of the horrible nature of the crime that was
committed there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jasper County Texas is typical middle America,'' Rowles said.
``The white community is just as appalled about this as the black
community is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the country to know that Jasper, Texas, is the best
place in the world to raise your family.''

 &HT;    Judges sets bail in Castle Case
 &HT;    By Christine Stapleton and Scott Hiaasen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A judge in Seattle set bail at $10
million Wednesday for Darion ``Sam'' Northrup Castle, the fugitive
sailor, lumberjack and boat builder who fled Florida in 1977 to
avoid a 10-year prison sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The bail covers the only new charge that Seattle prosecutors
filed against Castle: being a fugitive from justice. Castle will
return to a Seattle courtroom June 24 to determine the status of
his extradition to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   In Palm Beach County, Circuit Judge Ron Alvarez signed court
papers Wednesday to hold Castle without bail in his 1970 arson case
when he returns to Florida. Local prosecutors said they're barred
from filing new charges against Castle for fleeing the state
because Seattle prosecutors already have filed a fugitive charge.
</P>
<P>
   And there is no chance that Castle will face a first-degree
murder charge for the burning death of his girlfriend, Mary
Patricia Kirby. Castle and Kirby were severely burned on Labor Day
weekend in 1970 when they burned the 30-foot sailboat named Kuewa,
``vagabond'' in Hawaiian, which Castle had built. Castle, embroiled
in a nasty divorce, had a $15,000 insurance policy on the boat.
</P>
<P>
   Kirby died three weeks later after the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Under Florida law a person can be charged with first-degree
murder if someone is killed during the commission of a felony, such
as arson. Both Castle and Kirby were initially charged with arson,
but the charges were not upgraded to murder after Kirby's death.
</P>
<P>
   Local prosecutors say they're barred from filing a murder charge
against Castle now because court rules require prosecutors to file
all charges stemming from one incident at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972 a jury convicted Castle of three counts of arson, and he
was sentenced to 10 years in prison, the maximum sentence. But he
remained free for five more years while he appealed. Castle claimed
that firefighters had illegally seized evidence, including plastic
bags full of gasoline, when they put out the blaze on the boat.
</P>
<P>
   Florida appeals courts rejected Castle's appeals, and he took
his case to the U.S. Supreme Court, where he also lost.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 2, 1977, Castle was supposed to surrender to begin
serving his sentence. He never showed.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents believe Castle _ a towering figure at 6-feet-7
and the scion of a wealthy Hawaiian pioneer family _ and his second
wife had lived in the Seattle area for about five years until his
arrest Tuesday. All that time, Castle's apartment manager knew him
as Mark Bradfield _ the name of the Palm Beach County prosecutor
who convicted him 26 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Castle's wife, a Tallahassee woman who has traveled with the
fugitive since the 1970s, apparently uses the name Linda Sue
Castle, agents said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI in West Palm Beach learned a few months ago that the
couple might have been living in the western United States. Agents
began looking for them in Hawaii, California and Washington state,
said Reid Robertson, agent-in-charge of the FBI's West Palm Beach
office.
</P>
<P>
   They found out that Linda Sue was scheduled to fly Monday into
Seattle from Hawaii, where Castle's family lives, said agent Gary
Schoenlein. After landing, she changed clothes and led
investigators in circles before driving to the apartment where
Castle was arrested, agents said.
</P>
<P>
   At the King County jail, Castle has not admitted his identity,
refusing to be fingerprinted or photographed, Robertson said. He
may be forced to submit to both by court order. His lawyer, Michael
Nance could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Such tactics, along with his family's wealth and a well-timed
blizzard, helped Castle elude capture for 21 years, agents say.
</P>
<P>
   After Castle failed to surrender in 1977, agents tracked him by
following the travels of his father's private plane across the
Northwest, said Jim Cavanaugh, a retired FBI agent now living in
Bangs, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Cavanaugh tried for 14 years to catch Castle, and he still keeps
a picture of Castle and his wife taken along a fenceline in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Castle never held a steady job though he did work for a time as
a lumberjack, Cavanaugh said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was basically a loner,'' Cavanaugh said. ``I saturated the
Northwest with his photograph.''
</P>
<P>
   It nearly paid off in 1979, when authorities in British Columbia
thought they found Castle, calling himself Sam Coleman, living in a
trailer park. But Canadian officials, working under legal time
constraints, had to let him go when they couldn't confirm his
identity in time.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian courts required Castle's original fingerprints to
verify his identity, Cavanaugh said. But the fingerprint card was
at FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C., where a snowstorm closed
the airport and prevented Cavanaugh from getting his man.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Castle asked an Alaska lawyer if he still could be
extradited; the lawyer called the FBI's West Palm Beach office to
make sure the warrant was valid, Cavanaugh said.
</P>
<P>
   Castle later was featured on the television show Unsolved
Mysteries, prompting sightings of the giant sailor in Mexico,
Australia and other far-flung locales. Castle is a descendant of
Samuel Northrup Castle, one of the earliest settlers in Hawaii and
co-founder in 1851 of Castle &AMP; Cooke, a mercantile company that
eventually became part of the Dole produce company. Castle &AMP; Cooke
now is a Los Angeles real estate company with properties in
Florida, California and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   A person reached Wednesday at Castle's family's home in Volcano,
Hawaii, refused to comment.

6 DRIVERS CHARGED IN THEFTS FROM UPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (dc) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Six drivers for the United Parcel Service were
charged Wednesday with participation in a theft ring that federal
prosecutors said stole more than $175,000 in jewelry, computers and
other goods from delivery trucks and the services' midtown
distribution center.
</P>
<P>
   A 74-count indictment unsealed Wednesday, which stemmed from an
undercover operation run by the FBI, accused the six drivers in
Manhattan of selling the stolen property to bureau agents.
Officials of UPS said it was the biggest theft ring involving its
drivers in its history.
</P>
<P>
   Four doormen and two elevator operators who work in the Chelsea
area, as well as a former truck loader in UPS' midtown distribution
center, were also charged in the case.
</P>
<P>
   A law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity
said some of the property was stolen from company conveyer belts in
the large distribution center at 632 West 43rd St., as well as from
trucks making pickups and deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   Because the federal investigation paid only about a third of
what the stolen property was actually worth, the official said, the
actual value of the stolen property was closer to $750,000.
</P>
<P>
   The company first reported suspicions about a theft ring to the
FBI last year, and has cooperated fully ever since, a company
spokesman, Robert Godlewski, said by telephone from Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take seriously all threats to the security of the 12
million packages entrusted to our care every day,'' Godlewski said.
``I've heard of the isolated incidents where you've got a driver
who works in the hub who is taking stuff out of there _ penny-ante
stuff. Man, this is unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   In the year-long investigation, an agent posed as a middleman
who trafficked in stolen merchandise and worked out of a warehouse,
whose location was not disclosed in the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Jo White, the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan, and Lewis D.
Schiliro, assistant director in charge of the bureau's New York
field office, said in a joint statement that there were 67
instances in which stolen property was sold to an undercover agent
and a witness who was working secretly with the government.
</P>
<P>
   The drivers were based in the company's 43rd Street distribution
center, which handles more than one million packages a week, and
some held routes that took them through Chelsea, the indictment
said.
</P>
<P>
   The role of the doormen and elevator operators was not fully
described, but the law enforcement official said that in some
cases, the drivers would entrust the stolen property to the doormen
and elevator operators, who had access to areas in their buildings
where the stolen items could be stored.
</P>
<P>
   Among the drivers charged in the case, Robert Volpe, whose 19
years as a driver for the company was the longest service among
those charged, was assigned a route that included West 19th Street
between Fifth Avenue and Avenue of the Americas, the indictment
said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors accused Volpe of conspiring with a doorman at 16-20
West 19th St., who was described in the indictment only as Ralph,
to steal more than $90,000 in gold rings, New York State lottery
tickets, cameras, jewelry, beepers, Swiss Army knives, watches and
women's T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, Volpe and Ralph sold the stolen property directly
from Volpe's delivery truck, the indictment said. Volpe and the
doorman were also charged with offering to sell about 15 pounds of
marijuana to the undercover agent.
</P>
<P>
   In court Wednesday, Judge Sharon Grubin released Volpe on
$75,000 bail. Others charged in the case were also released on
bond. Volpe's lawyer, Leonard Joy, said that neither he nor his
client would comment. Volpe could face up to 15 years in prison on
conspiracy and theft charges, as well as five years on the drug
charge, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, as Manny Lopez, a driver for the company, was making
his deliveries on West 19th Street, some of his customers were
surprised to see him, instead of their regular driver, Volpe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's saying, `Where's Bobby? Where's Bobby?''' said
Lopez. ``I didn't know if he was on vacation or sick.'' &QL;

   In her prime she was known as the ``Queen of the Blues.'' And
she made it onto a postage stamp before Elvis did. And the premiere
of ``Dinah Was,'' a musical about Ms. Washington's life starring
Yvette Williams, was produced by Jean Doumanian. Which explains the
star power of the opening-night audience at the Gramercy Theater,
on 23rd Street near Lexington Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   About five minutes before curtain time, Woody Allen (whose films
are produced by Ms. Doumanian) was fingering a fortune-cookie he
said he had found in the pocket of the suit he was wearing: ``You
will be fortunate in the opportunities presented to you.'' But he
was reluctant to apply that to Ms. Washington's life. (She was
married seven times and died at age 39.)
</P>
<P>
   Jason Alexander, who is directing the upcoming film ``Cherry
Pink'' (which is also being produced by Ms. Doumanian), feigned
confusion. ``Dinah Washington?'' he said with a smile. ``I thought
the show was about Dinah Shore.''

   A Prince's Art to Be Auctioned
</P>
<P>
   The New York Academy of Art said Wednesday that Prince Charles
had joined the list of artists who have contributed items to be
sold at its ``Take Home a Nude'' auction next Wednesday. So are
there any subjects without clothes in the Prince's lithograph? ``I
have no idea,'' said Joe Heissan, the academy's director of
development, explaining that it had not been delivered yet. ``They
could be hiding.'' Already at the academy are an Eric Fishl
watercolor and a William Wegman photograph (of his dogs, of course,
and of course, they are ``not dressed,'' as Heissan put it).
</P>
<P>
   Prince Harry is headed for the playing fields of Eton. Harry,
13, was thrilled to pass the entrance exam for the exclusive
boarding school that his big brother, Prince William, entered three
years ago, the royal family said yesterday.

   Elaine Entangled In a Legal Brawl
</P>
<P>
   It was one of those late-night arguments in a bar, and like so
many late-night arguments in bars, it ended with an arrest and a
court date. But Elaine's, the watering hole of the rich and famous
on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, is not just any bar. The
person arrested on April 4 was the owner, Elaine Kaufman.
</P>
<P>
   The court date was Wednesday, and the assault charges against
Ms. Kaufman, 69, were dismissed. But the legal battles have only
just begun.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kaufman's lawyers said they planned to file a million-dollar
lawsuit against the customer who accused her of slapping him during
a dispute over a drink. And lawyers for the customer, James
Sorrels, said that they are suing Ms. Kaufman for $12 million for
``infliction of injury'' and slander.
</P>
<P>
   Sorrels, a 49-year-old marketing executive, said in court papers
that he was having a drink with a friend when Kaufman pounced on
him. He said that she appeared annoyed that he had bought just one
alcoholic drink (for himself) and a soft drink (for his friend). He
said she told him, ``You people look to me like poor white trash.
I'll bet you $50 you can't afford to buy another drink.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Ms. Kaufman nor her lawyers appeared before Judge Thomas
Farber in Manhattan Criminal Court Wednesday, when prosecutors
asked that the criminal charges be dismissed. ``The dispute did not
rise to criminal conduct,'' Luke McGrath, the assistant district
attorney in charge of the case, said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kaufman's lawyer, Ronald Fischetti, said she would file her
own lawsuit for malicious prosecution. Referring to Sorrels,
Fischetti said, ``We have witnesses that will come forward and show
his version is completely wrong.''

MERGED POWER COMPANY IS GETTING OFF TO A ROCKY START
</HEADLINE>
  (dc) 
 By BRUCE LAMBERT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GARDEN CITY, N.Y., _ The first 13 days of corporate marriage
between Long Island Lighting Co. and the Brooklyn Union Gas holding
company has turned into a stormy honeymoon, with both sides
fighting over their prenuptial agreement and vying for control of
their partnership.
</P>
<P>
   The directors of their newly merged entity, Marketspan Corp.,
will gather in the old LILCO headquarters in Hicksville on Thursday
for the inaugural board meeting. But what might have been a festive
occasion may now become a battle zone.
</P>
<P>
   Marketspan's chairman, William Catacosinos, is under attack by
Gov. George Pataki for getting $42 million in special compensation
as LILCO chairman on the eve of the state's takeover of the
electricity service.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's call for Catacosinos' ouster from Marketspan was
fortified on Monday. A letter from 22 of Long Island's 23
Republican state legislators pleaded with the merged company's new
president, Robert Catell, to seek the chairman's removal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a full-court press to get Catacosinos out,'' said a
state senate staff member, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   But Catacosinos, a wily infighter, has refused to budge. Some
insiders say that to bolster his own position, Catacosinos has been
fomenting opposition to Catell, who before the merger was chairman
of Brooklyn Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard talk about a move to dump Catell _ that would be a
huge mistake, a big, big mistake,'' said the state attorney
general, Dennis Vacco, at a news conference here. His staff is
investigating $67 million in executive payments _ $42 million to
Catacosinos and $25 million to 25 other LILCO officials.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki contends that the payments violated a provision in the
state's takeover agreement barring severance pay because all 8,000
LILCO and Brooklyn Union workers were guaranteed jobs with
Marketspan. The former LILCO executives say their payments were
legal entitlements.
</P>
<P>
   Public furor over the payments grew Wednesday. Three
class-action suits seeking restitution for LILCO shareholders were
filed in State Supreme Court here. (This may be difficult, as the
LILCO executives have already received their money.) And a series
of elected officials and candidates denounced the payments and
called for federal investigations.
</P>
<P>
   There was also private anger within Marketspan. Catell has told
some people that he was surprised and disturbed by the last-minute
LILCO payments. It stirred resentment and distrust among Brooklyn
Union's executives, who received no bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Catacosinos nor Catell responded to requests for
interviews, but a Marketspan spokesman, Joseph McDonnell, denied
there was internal dissension. He said that both executives still
supported the plan for Catacosinos to become the chairman and chief
executive, while Catell serves as president and chief operating
officer for a year. Then Catell is to assume the post of chief
executive. &QL;

BOEING'S NEWEST, SMALLEST PLANE ROLLS OFF THE LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ Although they came to see the rollout of
the new 717, what many Douglas workers had on their minds Wednesday
was a plane that is now built in Seattle and soon could be built
here _ the 737.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has already shifted some 737 work to its Long Beach plant
to help ease production bottlenecks in Renton, and is seriously
considering opening a Long Beach line for some versions of the 737
such as the Boeing Business Jet and 737s sold as convertible
freighters.
</P>
<P>
   Although the issue was not addressed by any of the rollout
speakers, Boeing executives in interviews afterward said their
study of a new 737 production line is about half finished and a
decision will definitely be made this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we are trying to do is make the right decision for the
total Boeing Co. and use all the assets we have,'' said Boeing
President Harry Stonecipher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fred Mitchell and his team will make that decision. They will
come forward and make a recommendation, and we generally follow the
recommendation.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell is executive vice president of airplane production for
Boeing. He came to Long Beach Monday to check on the 737 work
already under way here.
</P>
<P>
   Five 737s have so far been flown from Seattle for final interior
work and refurbishment at the underused Douglas factory. Five more
737s are to come.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has announced it will end production of the MD-80, MD-90
and MD-11 here, leaving only the new 717 rolling out the factory
door after early 2000. Douglas workers interviewed over the past
few days all said they believe the future of the Douglas plant
depends more on getting a 737 line than production of the 717.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing Chairman Phil Condit said the bottom line for any
decision on a new Long Beach production line is the unit cost of
building planes here vs. Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does it cost to produce the airplane? What facilities do
we have? What are the costs of moving? What are the costs of
building more capability in Seattle? You are looking at what it
takes to produce that airplane because in the end that's what
drives the market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Boeing Business Jet and 737 convertible
freighters, Condit said Boeing has not ruled out producing the
next-generation 737-900 in Long Beach. The model, for which Alaska
Airlines is the launch customer, has not yet entered production.
</P>
<P>
   It will be the largest 737 ever
</P>
<P>
   built.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has more than 800 back orders for its next generation 737
family, which has become the fastest-selling airplane ever.
</P>
<P>
   But its Renton plant is being taxed as the company ramps up
production to 24 planes a month by the second quarter of next year,
thus the close look at the underused Douglas facility.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell said he is impressed with the Douglas work force.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here are really working hard to show they have the
capability to stay in this business,'' he said, standing a few feet
from the 717 as Douglas workers crowded around it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This product right behind us (the 717) is a typical example,
where they took a tough assignment and came through on it. Now we
have some 737s down here and they are doing an excellent job. We
have a very, very efficient work staff here that's going through
some really trying times.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell said only a ``handful'' of Boeing people will be
involved in deciding whether a new 737 line will be set up in Long
Beach. He would not discuss the cost of tooling for the line, which
some analysts have said could be as as much as $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to look at efficiencies,'' he said. ``We have to make
sure we can do it cost-effectively. To move an airplane is a very
big decision. You don't do that overnight.''

INQUIRY HAS NO SUSPECTS IN FIREFIGHTER BRAWL

<P>
   NEW YORK _ A police investigation into a brawl by firefighters
at a restaurant in Bryant Park last week appeared to have stalled
Wednesday, with Police Commissioner Howard Safir saying that
witnesses had been unable to identify any suspects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only information we have is people alleging that
firefighters in uniform were drinking, urinating in public and
going into the ladies room,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that none of the civilians or firefighters who
witnessed the misbehavior at the Bryant Park Cafe on June 3 had
filed criminal complaints. Scores of firefighters had gone to the
cafe to celebrate after a midmorning ceremony at City Hall honoring
their acts of heroism.
</P>
<P>
   The cafe's bouncer, Ethan Kemp, who apparently mistook an
intervening police officer as a brawler and tossed him over a
flower pot, was the only person arrested. He has been charged with
assault, resisting arrest and obstruction of governmental
administration, the Manhattan district attorney's office said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The information we have is that if any assaults took place,
they were between firefighters, not with civilians,'' Safir said.
</P>
<P>
   If the criminal investigation stalls, the firefighters who took
part in the brawl and other public indiscretions could face
administrative charges brought by the fire department.
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney's office granted the fire department's
request to begin an administrative investigation Wednesday. While
refusing to comment on the evidence gained so far, Michael Regan, a
department spokesman, said that the internal investigation would
include interviews with firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   Two firefighters have been interviewed by the department's
investigative panel, said a fire official who spoke on the
condition of anonymity. He said that more interviews had been
scheduled for Thursday.

MERCURY  AFRAID OF SLOW START  
 LATE ARRIVALS IN CAMP SPUR CHEMISTRY CONCERN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ When the smoke cleared from some agonizing Mercury
cuts, a hard fact remained.
</P>
<P>
   A team with more than one-third of its active roster in training
camp for only two days must open the WNBA season at 7 tonight
against an opponent it beat four times last year by an average of
17 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Sacramento Monarchs (10-18 in 1997) are hungry and
dangerous. They have what could become the league's best backcourt
in rookie point guard Ticha Penicheiro and Ruthie Bolton-Holifield,
hero of the U.S. team that won the gold medal in the World
Championships.
</P>
<P>
   Defending Western Conference champion Phoenix (16-12) had better
beware. No matter how much deeper the Mercury is on paper, any team
fresh from hand-shaking introductions is vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to understand the first two weeks are going to be a
little bit difficult for us,'' said point guard Michele Timms, one
of a half-dozen players who arrived this week from the World
Championships. ``I think our expectations can't be too high.
Obviously, we don't want to lose any of the games, but we've got to
understand it's going to be pretty ugly out there. Especially for
our supporters, just bear with us until we jell as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   All the late arrivals made the team, although 6-foot-5 center
Marlies Askamp (plantar fascia/left foot) and guard/forward Mikiko
Hagiwara (tendinitis/left knee) begin the season on the injured
list. They will miss at least three games. When either returns,
June 21 at the earliest, someone off the active roster of 11 must
go.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (cut) has been very difficult to go through,''
Coach-General Manager Cheryl Miller said. ``They've given us
everything we wanted. I pleaded with the league for 13 spots, but
they didn't give them to us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate this part of the job. You can call it a character flaw,
and I'm the first one to admit it.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the final five players released were Tia Jackson, a 1997
second-round draft pick whose career never took off because of
injuries, and Dena Evans, a free agent with American Basketball
League experience who lost out as Timms' backup to Australian
Kristi Harrower.
</P>
<P>
   Harrower and Michelle Griffiths, a 6-foot-1 power forward who
survived the cut, were teammates with Timms on the bronze
medal-winning team at the World Championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kristi is going to fill my shoes on the national team,'' Timms
said. ``And Michelle is going to surprise everyone. Back home and
around the world, she's known as poetry in motion. She can be a
nice surprise packet.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury is expected to open with the starting lineup that
finished the season: Timms and Bridget Pettis at guards, Umeki Webb
and Toni Foster at forwards and Jennifer Gillom at center. Webb is
the most vulnerable because of the offensive skills that
third-round draft pick Brandy Reed offers.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said the last player on her bench is capable of playing
20 or more minutes and could start elsewhere in the 10-team league.
Timms agreed that the Mercury is much deeper and better prepared
for a Western Conference that now includes defending champion
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``No offense to anyone, but there is no comparison between the
two years (in talent),'' she said. ``We're bigger, we're stronger,
we're faster.''
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento is rebuilt, its only returners being Bolton-Holifield
and forwards Latasha Byears and Bridgette Gordon. They will be
joined in the starting lineup by Penicheiro, the league's No. 2
overall draft pick out of Old Dominion, and Linda Burgess, obtained
from the Los Angeles Sparks in a trade for Pam McGee.
</P>
<P>
   Bolton-Holifield made back-to-back three-pointers in the final
two minutes of the World Championships gold medal game Sunday as
the United States overcame Russia, 71-65.
</P>
<P>
   The Monarches were 0-2 in exhibitions, losing to the Sparks. The
Mercury won twice over the Utah Starzz. Sacramento is undersized
and has an inexperienced bench that includes Arizona's Adia Barnes,
the Pac-10 Player of the Year. &QL;

EXPECTATIONS RISE IN YEAR 2 FOR WNBA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Success in the inaugural season of the WNBA brought honors for
league President Val Ackerman. She was named Grand Marketer of the
Year by Brandweek magazine after the league had a regular-season
attendance average of 9,669 (more than twice its conservative
predictions), signed multiyear agreements with the likes of
Anheuser-Busch, Coca-Cola, General Motors, McDonald's, Nike and
Sears, and, through its three-network national television alliance,
attracted more than 50 million viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman also was awarded the Distinguished Alumna Award from
the University of Virginia, where she was a four-year basketball
starter and two-time Academic All-American. She graduated from
Virginia in 1981 and from the UCLA law school in '85, then joined
the NBA as a staff attorney in '88. After eight years as an NBA
executive, she was named to head the WNBA.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent conference call with reporters, Ackerman discussed
Year 2 of the league.
</P>
<P>
   Question: What will be the early impact for teams with so many
players coming off the World Championships?
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman: My hope is that they can assimilate as quickly as
possible. In some cases, we do have players that were in the league
last year and to the extent they are accustomed to their coaches
and teammates, they will at least have a head start on what the
offenses and defenses will be. Obviously when you have new players
like Rachael Sporn, Alessandra Santos de Oliveira, Michelle
Griffiths or Maria Stepanova, just to name a few, I think there
will be an adjustment period. It may well take weeks for them to
become acclimated not only to their teams, but to living in the
United States. It is just one of the areas we're going to have to
do the best we can because we expect going forward, there will be
scheduling issues with international events.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you view the signings of this year's college seniors as a
turning point in terms of people wanting to join your league?
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman: The fundamental difference between this year and last
year in our acquisition efforts was we hadn't yet had a season last
year. No one could imagine, no matter how hard we tried to explain
it, just exactly what the league would be like, the fans we would
attract and the amount of exposure we would generate. We found all
the players that we had discussions with had seen a game on
television or had come to games, and they had read about us. In
many cases, they had teammates who were with one of our teams who
could speak firsthand about the way they were treated by our teams,
what it felt like to play a game in Madison Square Garden or
America West Arena in front of 16,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you anticipate any problems with sustaining momentum in
Year 2?
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman: We're very sensitive to the issue. We don't take
anything for granted at this point. We were very surprised by the
results last year. It has made us work even harder to make sure
this year that not only our internal expectations but the
expectations of others will be met. We have projected this year a
leaguewide attendance average of 10,000 fans. We're hoping to crack
the five-figure mark, a little bit of an increase from last year.
Nevertheless, we recognize this year is a test because the
curiosity is lessened and the novelty is gone.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the status of the players union?
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman: It's a league issue, but it's not a league process.
It's in the hands of the players as to whether or not they feel
like they want to be unionized as a way to deal with management,
and what the timing would be. If the union came to pass, they would
have to identify what the issues would be from their standpoint. If
it were to happen, we would try to be as constructive as we can in
dealing with the issues that were brought before us. In the
meantime, what we do is continue to try and make the league as
positive an experience as we can for the players, keeping in mind
our business objectives and our intended interests in operating in
a way that's going to give us the best chance of staying in
business. &QL;

COUNCIL SIDES WITH OLDER POLICE CANDIDATES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The City Council voted overwhelmingly Wednesday to
override Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's veto of a bill that would allow
40 candidates to enter the Police Academy although they exceed the
age limit of 34 for recruits.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates for the police force, some in their mid-40s, had
come within two days of joining the academy last year when they
were told they were ineligible because the age limit, which had
expired at the time they took their entrance tests, had been
restored. After passing the physical and psychological exams
required to enter the academy, many of the would-be recruits had
sold their businesses or quit their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   They turned to the Council for help, hoping to join an academy
class that is scheduled to begin on July 1. The Council responded
by passing a bill that exempted the 40 candidates, and the mayor
promptly vetoed the measure.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday, after passionate speeches invoking civil-rights
leaders, the Council voted 43-4 to override that veto. In a rare
move, three of the seven Republicans on the council broke with the
mayor to support the override.
</P>
<P>
   Council members contended that the bill was a matter of simple
fairness for the 40 older candidates who still want to be officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is reached where whatever the exact legalities, the
decent thing to do when you have such qualified people is to let
them through,'' said Councilman Sheldon Leffler, chairman of the
Public Safety Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani and his police commissioner, Howard Safir, asserted
that giving those candidates a break would open the city to
lawsuits from scores of would-be officers. The older recruits,
police officials say, could endanger citizens and other officers
because they would be slower and less fit.
</P>
<P>
   Safir called the vote ``outrageous and ridiculous.'' He added,
``There are, indeed, many 70-year-olds who are quite active and
robust, but that certainly is not the norm.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats on the Council said they hoped Wednesday's vote would
help energize members before a special meeting Thursday, when party
leaders will ask the Council to flex its political muscle again and
override the mayor's veto of major parts of the new city budget.
</P>
<P>
   Councilwoman Annette Robinson, D-Brooklyn, said, ``We have a
right and a responsibility to serve as a check and balance to the
mayor.'' And Councilman Stanley Michels, a Democrat from Manhattan,
said, ``In my 21 years here, I don't remember being more proud of
the Council.''
</P>
<P>
   Randy Mastro, the deputy mayor for operations, said the city was
likely to go to court to try to prevent the older candidates from
joining the academy class that begins July 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there anyone in New York City who wants 60-year-old rookie
cops on the beat?'' Mastro said. ``No _ except for the City
Council.''
</P>
<P>
   The class of officers took the entrance examination during a
brief period when the age requirement had lapsed, but it later was
restored. A lawsuit on behalf of the candidates by the New York
Civil Liberties Union is pending in state Supreme Court in
Manhattan, but the candidates turned to the Council in hope of
quicker action. The 40 people who still hope to join the force
range in age from 36 to 49, according to their lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   One of the candidates, Aida Perez, 40, of Queens, said she
believed that the older candidates had proved they would make
effective officers by ``taking a very adverse situation and
demonstrating problem-solving abilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronald DiPippo, 42, of the Bronx, said, ``We weren't trying to
slip in. This was something I'd wanted to do all my life, and they
told me this was my chance. They said it was an equal-opportunity
test, and I trusted the Police Department.''

NEW LAWYER FOR DEFENDANT IN BEATING CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOHN T. McQUISTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIVERHEAD, N.Y. _ A white man from Queens, who was charged with
the near-fatal beating of a black man outside a Westhampton Beach
nightclub two years ago, had his lawyer replaced Wednesday by a
judge who noted that the defendant owed more than $73,000 in legal
fees and had no way to pay.
</P>
<P>
   The bills were from Bruce Barket of Garden City, who for nearly
two years represented the indigent defendant, Austin Offen,
including a five-week trial that ended on April 8 with a hung jury.
Barket told the judge he would be willing to defend Offen in a
second trial, but only as a court-appointed lawyer paid by the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Offen, 27, is accused of beating Shane Daniels, 23, of Riverhead
with an iron bar outside the Club Marakesh on May 26, 1996, causing
severe skull injuries. He is being held in the Suffolk County jail
in $500,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   In a three-page decision dated June 9 and issued Wednesday
afternoon, Judge Joel Lefkowitz of Suffolk County Criminal Court
rejected Barket's request for state assistance and relieved him as
Offen's counsel. The judge requested that the Legal Aid Society of
Suffolk County assign Offen a new lawyer from its list of
volunteers and ordered Offen to return to court on Friday for a
hearing with his new lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Barket had asked the judge to dismiss him and then reappoint him
as Offen's Legal Aid lawyer at the society's rate of $40 an hour.
Barket's original agreement with Offen provided for payment of
$1,500 for each day of trial.
</P>
<P>
   Lefkowitz said Barket's request to be dismissed stated that
trying the case a second time would result in a conflict of
interest between Offen and his other paying clients. While granting
Barket's motion for dismissal, the judge declined to reappoint him.
</P>
<P>
   Lefkowitz noted that Barket had recently left a partnership and
was now a sole practitioner. ``Therefore he has no one to rely on
in order to properly maintain his practice or assist his other
clients,'' the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In any event, a defendant does not have the right to select an
attorney'' from the Legal Aid Society's list of lawyers willing to
represent the poor, the judge concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Barket could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Offen's new lawyer will have to become familiar with the
testimony of the more than 40 witnesses presented by the
prosecution during the first trial. Daniels, whose peripheral
vision remains severely limited, says he has no memory of the
early-morning attack.
</P>
<P>
   Offen's defense will be further complicated because his second
trial will be merged with that of his co-defendant, Constantine
Chronis, 37, a former New York City detective charged with holding
back Daniels' friends with a gun while, witnesses say, Offen beat
Daniels and shouted racial epithets.
</P>
<P>
   Chronis, who has since resigned from the police, is charged with
assault and criminal misconduct and is free on $200,000 bond.

Brazil shows Scotland 
the stuff of champions
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN P. LOPEZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SAINT DENIS, France _ Every few minutes before Wednesday's 1998
World Cup opener, metro trains pulled into the Porte de la Chapelle
stop outside the Stade de France and swells of painted Brazilian
fans surged out the doors.
</P>
<P>
   It was an unstoppable Brazilian rush, like a tidal wave of
green-and-yellow energy swarming France.
</P>
<P>
   The doors swung open, and hundreds of bodies pushed their way
out of the overstuffed car, elbowing, squeezing, falling over one
another. They were beating drums and blowing whistles. They were
carrying each other on their shoulders, waving flags and holding
beers or bottles of wine in each hand.
</P>
<P>
   They couldn't be stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Later on the way to a 2-1 victory, Brazil's Ronaldo, Bebeto,
Denilson and Cesar Sampaio seemed to reflect the train-station
scene, bursting to an overwhelming early display when the doors to
the 1998 World Cup opened against Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   Each Brazilian player who touched the ball seemed to be trying
to top the previous one, slashing across the field and tiptoeing
the soccer ball around the defense. Brazil scored a goal barely
five minutes into the match on a beautiful curving corner kick by
Bebeto to Sampaio, who headed it in.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilians had five corner kicks and a dazzling 10 shots on
goal in the first 20 minutes alone. The wild Brazilian fans who
helped fill Stade de France to capacity (80,000) seemed ready to
start doing the samba in the aisles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted an open game,'' said Brazil coach Mario Zagallo, who
has been harshly criticized for what has been considered a
conservative style. ``I wanted a traditional Brazilian game.''
</P>
<P>
   Early, it looked like Brazil and Zagallo would get just that.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, however, the pace slowed and Brazil's victory did
not look nearly as awe-inspiring at the end as it did in the
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Brazil managed to accomplish what few defending Cup
champions have done in the past _ it won. And despite falling into
a more methodical game in the second half, Brazil clearly showed
considerable explosiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very difficult because it was the first game and
everyone was nervous,'' Zagallo said. ``But there's great
satisfaction with the win. Getting the three points right from the
start was very important.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, defending a World Cup crown has proved to be
difficult for championship teams, especially in the
much-anticipated and widely watched opening game four years later.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1974, West Germany (1978), Argentina (1982 and 1990),
Italy (1986) and Brazil (1974) all either lost or tied the first
World Cup game they played after taking the crown.
</P>
<P>
   But this Brazilian team, thanks to the wonderful play of
Ronaldo, who had the Scottish defense backpedaling all day, and the
wonderful good fortune of a decisive 73rd-minute sequence, was
victorious.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were better than us; they clearly showed that they
were,'' Scottish coach Craig Brown said. ``But we fought the whole
time, and we were in a position to get a point out of it (for a
tie). Instead, we get nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing, but I think we proved that Brazil is not
an amazing team. It's very good in the midfield and up front but
with weaknesses at the back.''
</P>
<P>
   The clinching goal, in fact, came on an own-goal by Scotland's
Tommy Boyd, but it was Brazil's superiority up front on the attack
that sparked the smart play by Cafu.
</P>
<P>
   Ronaldo began the flurry from midfield, where he showed
spectacular skill throughout the day, twice nearly scoring. On the
way to the winning goal, he first got the ball to Denilson, who had
replaced Bebeto moments earlier and played well over the game's
final 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Denilson fired a quick shot that Scottish goalie Jim Leighton
saved but could not hold. The ball caromed to Cafu, who was
standing between players six yards in front of the net as Leighton
was trying to get back into position.
</P>
<P>
   Cafu quickly chipped an awkward shot at the goal, and it bounced
of Leighton's face toward Boyd.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're in front of the net, you just try to get a shot
away and maybe get it to bounce in,'' Cafu said.
</P>
<P>
   It did _ off Leighton's face, then off Boyd's shoulder and into
the net for an own-goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were keeping the pressure on them as much as we could,''
Cafu said. ``We can play better. We had a lot of chances, but at
least we made the most of the last chance we had.''
</P>
<P>
   Scotland, which scored its goal on a penalty kick after Kevin
Gallacher was pushed while chasing a free ball inside Brazil's box,
never recovered after the own-goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Scots dropped to 0-1 in Group A, with games left against
Norway and Morocco. Only the top two teams in each group during
round-robin play advance to the second-round single-elimination
phase.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a great day because we won,'' Zagallo said. ``We were
lucky to get the ball to bounce into the net, yes, but we had a lot
of other shots barely miss that could have gone in.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even with the second-half lull, the Brazilians outshot
the Scots 23-10 and had 11 corner kicks to Scotland's five. If not
for Leighton's many saves, it easily could have been 3-0 at the
break.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before this game, I said that I wanted to find out if we were
just a talented team or a great team,'' Zagallo said. ``I think we
can be great. If there's luck involved, too, then that makes it
even better. That improves our odds. All champions have luck.''
</P>
<P>
   These defending champions, again, seem to have it all.

HOW TO STOP THOSE MESSY FIGHTS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometime soon, possibly before the All-Star Game, Major League
Baseball officials probably will announce the formation of a
special committee to look into ways to stop fights during games.
</P>
<P>
   Acting Commissioner  &UR; Bud Selig, who needs to decide whether he
wants to own the Milwaukee Brewers or be the real commissioner,
announced last week that the league and the players association,
which laughingly must approve the slightest of changes to the game,
are looking into ways to deter brawls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am distressed by the recent on-the-field fighting that has
detracted from the spirit and character of Major League Baseball,''
Selig said in a release. ``It has placed the safety of players in
jeopardy and reflected poorly on that large majority of players who
respect and maintain the tradition of sportsmanship long associated
with the game.''
</P>
<P>
   It all sounds good, but fighting in baseball is not a new
phenomenon. Some changes can be implemented. For instance,
relievers who leave the bullpen and run more than the length of a
football field to join in a fracas can, and probably will, be
stopped.
</P>
<P>
   But to expect players in the dugout not to come to the aid of
their teammate, usually a lone batter against what could be nine
players, is ridiculous. It's been part of the big-league game since
the days of  &UR; Ty
 &UR; Cobb.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball fights are not new. Watching them from six angles with
slow-motion replays, however, is a more recent trend. The
proliferation of televised games is the only new thing baseball has
encountered with fights.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when these fights would occur just as routinely
as now, and it was no big deal, mostly because the entire nation
could only read about them, not actually watch them time and again
on TV. &QL; 
On the warpath &QL; 
The Cleveland Indians, one of the American League's kingpins five
years running, have added an impressive pitching staff to what once
was a one-dimensional ballclub intent on banging its way though a
season with muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, an Indians staff that has been hit hard by injuries
leads the league in ERA. Since bottoming out with a 20-18 record on
May 13, the Indians have gone 18-7.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest reason for the upsurge belongs to starters  &UR; Charles
 &UR; Nagy, Dave Burba and  &UR; Jaret Wright. That trio has a combined 13-1
record since the Indians began their winning ways. Throw in  &UR; Dwight
 &UR; Gooden, who has allowed four earned runs in his past two starts,
and
 &UR; Bartolo Colon (5-4), and the Indians are looking like a club that
could scare once the playoffs begin.
</P>
<P>
   It's true Cleveland is fortunate to reside in the AL East, a
division filled with mediocrity and where only the Indians are
above .500. Cleveland's front office is fully aware they are in a
weakened division, something they do not need to apologize for.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland General Manager  &UR; John Hart knew the Indians could slug
their way into the playoffs. He also knows, once there, pitching
will get them to advance, which is exactly what Cleveland did last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Now they're hoping history will repeat itself on the north side
of Ohio. &QL; 
The great Moises &QL; 
 &UR; Moises Alou, who voiced displeasure when he became the first cog in
the Marlins' World Series championship club to be jettisoned last
fall, appears to be over the initial hurt and is now one happy
Houston Astros player.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Alou's teammates have welcomed their new slugger with
open arms. He leads the Astros in home runs and RBIs and is one
point behind  &UR; Carl Everett in average, pushing him alongside  &UR; Jeff
Bagwell and
 &UR; Craig Biggio as go-to guys on the defending Central Division
championship club.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning, I wasn't as happy as I am now,'' Alou said.
``I wasn't used to being in Houston and playing with these guys. It
takes a lot to get adjusted to playing with a new team. At the same
time, I never felt like a new guy because I was proven. I didn't
have to show anyone what kind of player I was.''
</P>
<P>
   Alou began his stint with Houston hot and has been basically the
same ever since, no matter what he recently said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel like I was driving in enough runs early in the
season, but I feel like I'm doing much better now,'' said Alou, who
was batting .335 and had 13 home runs and 53 RBIs entering
Wednesday's game against Detroit. ``I'm getting a lot of two-hit
(games), which is something I feel like I'm supposed to do. It also
helps to be on a club like ours where there are so many weapons in
the lineup.'' &QL;

HORRIBLE RE CORDS RUN IN MINORS, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Not only are the Diamondbacks trying to avoid having a
worse record than the Florida Marlins, a similar battle is being
waged at the minor league level.
</P>
<P>
   The worst team in the minors is Brevard County, the Marlins'
Class A affiliate in the Florida State League. Through Tuesday, the
club was 17-44, No. 118 out of 118 minor league teams.
</P>
<P>
   But right within striking distance are the South Bend Silver
Hawks, the Diamondbacks' Class A team in the Midwest League. After
losing 12 of 13 games through Tuesday, the Hawks were 18-42.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the Diamondbacks, their other, more advanced
Class A team, High Desert, is doing much better.
</P>
<P>
   How bad are the Silver Hawks? Let us count the ways.
</P>
<P>
   Item: They had a league-leading 125 errors, more than two a
game. Next in the league was Beloit with 102 errors.
</P>
<P>
   Item: They had a .238 team batting average, last in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Item: During a recent four-game sweep by West Michigan, the
Hawks were outscored, 32-6.
</P>
<P>
   Item: During another four-game span, one of them a victory, the
Hawks struck out 52 times, or just less than half of 108 possible
outs.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of offense and defense has taken its toll on a decent
pitching staff. But right-hander  &UR; Jeff  &UR; Andrews has suffered the
most. In each of Andrews' past eight starts, he has not given up
more than two earned runs. His record is 0-2 with six no-decisions.
Overall, Andrews is 1-5 with a 2.22 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Rival managers know how good Andrews is. He was one of four
Hawks picked for the All-Star Game. Another selection was
lefthander  &UR; Ben Norris, who has an 0-4 record to go with a 3.09
ERA. Yet another pitcher,  &UR; Jason Jensen, was good enough to make
it. He has a 2.78 ERA. And pitcher  &UR; Ynocencio de la Cruz was
outstanding until suffering a separated shoulder during a brawl.
He's out for a full year.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, job opportunities are available.  &UR; Mel Didier, the
Diamondbacks director of player development, said some of the
recent draft picks, notably pitcher  &UR; Javier Lopez (a fourth-round
selection), will start out at South Bend.
</P>
<P>
   The other piece of good news is that the All-Star break is at
hand. The other two All-Stars are second baseman  &UR; Jackie Rexrode,
who will start, and first baseman  &UR; Wyley Steelmon, who probably
won't play because of a separated shoulder. &QL; 
Brief stints &QL; 
Right-hander  &UR; Martin Sanchez was suspended by High Desert for
disciplinary reasons and sent to extended spring training in
Tucson. The Mavericks' closer, Sanchez had eight saves.
</P>
<P>
   High Desert placed catcher  &UR; Keith Wilson on the disabled list
(root canal) and sent catcher  &UR; Jose Lopez and infielder
 &UR; Jared Martin to South Bend. Joining the Mavericks were left-handers
 &UR; Jason Martines and  &UR; Jeff Wilson, righty  &UR; Don Peters (rehab
assignment) and catcher  &UR; Brad Allison.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Hanley Frias, recovering from a broken bone in his hand, made
his first appearance Tuesday. Playing third base for Tucson, Frias
went 0 for 1 and had three walks and a stolen base. He is on 20-day
rehab assignment.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander  &UR; Joe Verplancke, who won five games in relief for
High Desert, moved into the starting rotation and won two more
games. &QL;

BEST SHOW IS BEFORE GAME WITH MCGWIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GINTONIO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Buck Showalter looked out toward Bank One Ballpark's
upper deck in left field, near a restaurant. That's the area where
Mark McGwire likely will park a bushel of balls during batting
practice this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe instead of soup specials, they should have helmet
specials,'' the Diamondbacks manager said.
</P>
<P>
   OK, maybe stand-up comedy isn't what Showalter should do if he
ever needs another job, but you get the idea. When Big Red comes to
town, expect to get showered with horsehide.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are that thousands of fans will congregate in left and
left-center field stands a couple of hours before each of this
weekend's games for the opportunity to snag a drive by the St.
Louis Cardinals slugger, who has 30 home runs and is on pace to
break the single-season record of 61.
</P>
<P>
   At stadiums across the country, the lure of taking home a
McGwire blast has been hard to resist. At some parks, almost 10,000
early arrivals have dashed for baseballs.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Regas, general manager of Friday's Front Row Grill at Bank
One Ballpark, said the restaurant that offers outdoor seating will
be jammed for the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could watch, but I'll be too busy,'' he said.
``Nobody else has ever had this kind of effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the pre-game radio host will get in the act. Brad Cesmat of
KTAR-AM (620) will be in the outfield stands with a net starting at
6 p.m. Any balls he catches will be donated to the Blind Children's
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Batting practice pitchers do their best to accommodate the
hitters, which in turn means accommodating the fans in the outfield
stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just put the ball where the hitter wants it,'' said Marcos
Garcia, one of three batting practice hurlers for the Diamondbacks.
``The big thing is to keep it in the strike zone and keep it at the
same speed. If you change speeds, they might complain. In batting
practice, a player wants to get his stroke down, and he may want a
pitch in a certain spot every time.''
</P>
<P>
   So you catch a McGwire homer during batting practice, and you
have . . . exactly that, a scuffed ball, maybe hit a dozen times,
worth maybe a buck. If you're lucky enough to latch onto a home run
he hits during the game, the sentimental value will far outweigh
the monetary value, even if the slugger eventually surpasses Roger
Maris' mark of 61 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make any difference what number it is, other than
60, 61 or 62,'' said Chuck Simo, owner of Nostalgia Stadium in
Scottsdale. ``Any other is just a home run ball, no more
significant than any other. And batting practice home runs are
meaningless.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're in the right place at the right time and catch the
ball that breaks Maris' mark, keep your senses about you, Simo
warns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get it verified,'' he said. ``Get the names and addresses of
people around you who saw you get the ball. If he does break the
record, whoever gets that ball will probably hold onto it for an
auction for collectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to say what it would be worth at this time. For
instance, the ball that Mickey Mantle hit for his first home run
went for $27,000 at an auction. The most expensive ball ever, and
it will go up for auction in November, will be the first home run
ever hit in Yankee Stadium. It was hit by Babe Ruth, and will bring
well over $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Even though big money won't be involved, if you're anywhere near
the vicinity of a McGwire home run this weekend, be prepared for
pushing, shoving and maybe a few bruises in the scramble for the
ball.
</P>
<P>
   But if the unthinkable happens, and McGwire just hits grounders
or pop-ups during batting practice, don't start yanking your hair
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't realize it's not that easy to hit a home run in
batting practice,'' McGwire told columnist Mark Whicker of the
``Orange County Register.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also a good idea to keep something else in mind when you're
scratching and clawing for baseballs. In many cases, you'll be
invading the territory of fans who have bought seats, and instead
of going home with a ball, your only souvenir might be a shiner. &QL;

LEADERS NEEDED FOR SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Oakland Athletics of the late 1980s, as talented a
collection of players the game had seen in decades, had it. So has
nearly every World Series champion.
</P>
<P>
   The common denominator to almost all championship clubs is
strong leadership from within. Very few rudderless clubs are
capable of winning a championship of any kind, whether it's a
division title or the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leadership is not overrated,'' said Reggie Smith, an integral
part of the great Dodgers clubs of the 1970s. ``You do need to have
it, regardless of where it comes from. Look at the teams that do
well and they all have someone or several that the other players
trust and respond to.''
</P>
<P>
   The current Dodgers and Colorado Rockies, a pair of sputtering
clubs who, by most accounts, should be better, have each been
accused of lacking leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Just about everyone associated with the Rockies believes the
club dearly misses first baseman Andres Galarraga and shortstop
Walt Weiss. Neither player was very vocal, but each set an example
that was undeniable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We miss those guys more than anyone around here wants to
admit,'' one Rockies player said. ``They kept some of the, quote,
stars around here in check. Everyone had to work as hard as they
did because you looked foolish if you didn't. That's not the case
this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The tremendously talented Dodgers have been referred to as
classic underachievers the past four years. A lack of leadership
among the players has been blamed for most, if not all, of the
Dodgers' shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' primary whipping boy always was catcher Mike
Piazza, the highest-paid player and the one in the spotlight. It
always seemed to be Piazza's fault when the Dodgers' pitching staff
didn't perform at the same level as Atlanta's famed staff.
</P>
<P>
   During spring training, former Los Angeles center fielder Brett
Butler, now retired, laced into Piazza for his lack of leadership
skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike Piazza is the greatest hitter I have ever been around,
but you can't build around Piazza because he is not a leader,''
Butler told the ``Los Angeles Times.'' ``Mike Piazza is a moody,
self-centered, '90s player. We're in crunch time during pennant
races the last two years and all Piazza seems to care about is
winning the MVP from Larry Walker or the batting title from Tony
Gwynn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you want to spend $100 million and build your team around
that or pay for a less-talented guy who is more of a leader?''
</P>
<P>
   Butler's words ricocheted throughout the Dodgers' clubhouse.
Some players privately agreed with Butler. Some, of course, did
not. Either way, Piazza, now with the New York Mets, did not seem
to leave many friends behind.
</P>
<P>
   Within days of Piazza being jettisoned from LA in one of the
biggest trades in baseball history last month, several Dodgers
spoke of the club's situation finally being relieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The electricity in here is unbelievable,'' second baseman Eric
Young said. ``It was like we're starting a brand new season. You
hate to see a guy like Mike Piazza leave, but we knew something had
to be done. It just wasn't clicking. But now, everything is
different.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Ramon Martinez said, ``Everybody can see the difference
in the team. Everyone is excited again, and we feel good about the
team. You can see a big difference on the bench in the games.
Everything is better now.''
</P>
<P>
   To put the blame for the Dodgers' shortcomings squarely on
Piazza is not fair, said former Dodgers great and current San Diego
coach Davey Lopes, considered one of the best leaders of all-time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't force leadership on a player,'' Lopes said. ``Some
players have enough problems worrying about themselves and can't
carry the emotional and physical weight of also being the team's
leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like charisma; you can't turn it on if you don't have it.
Being a leader is an intangible that some players are born with.
It's how others perceive you to be. Organizations make mistakes and
think they can make someone a leader. You can't assume the role, it
has to come from the person.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it can take years to discover a leader or bring one
into an organization. As an expansion club, the Diamondbacks are at
a disadvantage because they were thrown together for the first time
during spring training. Jay Bell is a candidate. Someone who might
emerge at some point is rookie first baseman Travis Lee, who could
develop into a silent leader.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego third baseman Ken Caminiti, considered one of the
great silent leaders, never asked for the role. Like a truly great
leader, he never pushed it away when it was headed in his
direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it comes from the way you carry yourself and the way
you play the game,'' said Caminiti, the unanimous National League
MVP in 1996. ``It's something you earn. I don't mind it at all. If
you have respect you can say whatever. But you have to be
constructive, not a (jerk). You can't have a winning club without
leaders among the players. It can't come from the (coaching)
staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Leadership can come in many different forms. Those Oakland clubs
that went to the World Series three consecutive years from 1988 to
1990 were loaded with players who went in their own direction.
</P>
<P>
   Rickey Henderson, Jose Canseco, Dennis Eckersley and Dave Parker
weren't exactly the kind of players who would take kindly to any
player getting in their face and telling him what to do.
</P>
<P>
   Those A's clubs that averaged more than 100 victories over a
three-year period may have seemed more like rock stars on tour, but
they weren't without leadership from within the ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Carney Lansford provided some with his
blue-collar, workmanlike approach that helped him serve as the
leader for the bulk of the A's. For the rest, the superstars, there
was center fielder Dave Henderson, who surprisingly wielded more
clout than may have been known at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson's constant gap-toothed smile provided the perfect
cover for his often pointed jokes in the clubhouse and the dugout.
It was not uncommon to hear Henderson making comments such as:
</P>
<P>
   ``The right fielder (Canseco) should have made that catch in the
sixth inning. If he had we would have won the game. Maybe he was
checking out some babe in the stands. All I know is the next time,
he better have his head in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Canseco would laugh along with several other teammates at the
inference, but the message was sent crystal clear. The other A's
all knew what was being said, even if it was disguised as a joke.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson would just as easily rankle Canseco as he would Rickey
Henderson or Bob Welch or even Manager Tony La Russa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hendu said what had to be said,'' said Dave Stewart, a 20-game
winner on those Oakland staffs. ``He wasn't shy with his criticisms
but he never embarrassed a player. He said it to get the player
thinking and nine out of 10 times it worked.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Jackson call Texas murder``most heinous'' racial crime in almost
50 years
 &HT;    By Andy Adams
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ Rev. Jesse Jackson told about 300 people crammed
into a small Baptist church for a prayer vigil Wednesday evening
that the murder of James Byrd Jr. was the nation's ``most heinous''
crime of racial hate in almost 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said he visited Jasper, an East Texas town of about
8,000 people, to console Byrd's family because, ``At a time like
this, we are breathless. We can't quite explain it. We don't
understand it. We are hurt, we're embarrassed, we are humiliated,
we are afraid. What can we do?''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd, a 49-year-old Jasper man, was dragged to death behind a
truck early Sunday morning. Three white men are being held by
Jasper authorities on murder charges in connection with the death
of Byrd, who was black.
</P>
<P>
   In the Greater New Bethel Baptist Church, where 59 of 133
members attended services Sunday, area residents flooded the chapel
for two hours of prayer and singing followed by Jackson's speech.
Another several hundred people gathered outside, as did numerous
members of the local and national media.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nation is in shock today over this heinous crime,''
Jackson said. ``It is the most heinous crime of this sort to happen
since Emmett Till in Mississippi nearly 50 years ago. So why are
people here from Chicago or Houston or other parts of Texas? He was
not killed because of geography.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone said, `Well, at least, it was not a planned killing.
It was not a conspiracy arbitrarily.' That's worse than a plan
because, if our lives are in jeopardy in general because of our
race, our sex, our religion _ that's worse than a plan. We should
be safe in general, not in jeopardy in general.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson opened and closed his appearance with prayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come by here, my Lord. Come by here,'' he prayed. ``Come by
here, my Lord. Come by here. Somebody needs you, Lord. Come by
here. We're waiting on you. We can't do nothing without you. Came
by here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Search our hearts. You know our ways. Find the things in our
hearts that should not be: hatred, jealousy, malice. Remove any
racism, sexism, anti-Semitism or meanness. Remove it right now and
make us better, not bitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson visited Byrd's family before attending the prayer vigil.
He told them of professional basketball player Dennis Rodman's
desire to help by offering to pay Byrd's funeral cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dennis is from Texas and he has an acute sensitivity to the
family's pain,'' Jackson said. ``It's just a joy for me to know
that they always try to portray Dennis as some buffoon, because he
_ like most Texans _ likes funny hairstyles. I do think it was just
a tremendous gesture on the part of Dennis Rodman to say to the
mayor, `Send me the bill for the funeral expenses.'''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson compared the racial tension in East Texas to a parable
in the Bible about how lions and lambs learned to live in harmony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because lions are stronger than lambs, they have the press on
their sides,'' he said. ``Because they're stronger than lambs, they
have more life options than lambs. Lambs learn early on to stay out
of lions' way. And lions, because of the stress of their character
deficit, destroy lambs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jasper will never be safe for whites until it's safe for
blacks. It will not be safe for blacks until it's safe for whites.
What the lion and the lamb have in common is that neither lamb nor
lion wants the forest to catch on fire. Neither lion nor lamb want
acid rain on their backs. Neither lion nor lamb wants the water
poisoned. Surely, if lion and lamb can find common ground, then
black and white _ all of God's children _ must find common
ground.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, Jasper is not starting its effort to build racial
harmony from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he was glad to see both white and black ministers
lined up to attend to the Byrd family's needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it's not one side of town mourning and the other side of
town observing. There's a sense of agony everywhere. And that's a
step in the right direction, because we should go from agony to
ecstacy together. We should go from tragedy to triumph together. We
should say to those killing, `Never again,' together. We must live
together as brothers and sisters together.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson concluded by referring to two more parts of scripture:
John's story in Revelations and the parable of the good Samaritan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a new heaven and a new earth,'' he said, quoting
Revelations. ``I see a new Jasper. The old one has passed away. We
must not tolerate hate on any side of town. We must not tolerate
violence on any side of town. There must be a new Jasper, for the
old one has passed away.

SISTERS OF NO MERCY GIVE HECK TO FOES OF PHOENIX WNBA TEAM
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Sacramento isn't sacred, they'll proclaim at
Thursday's Mercury season opener.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is much of anything else to the Sisters of No Mercy.
</P>
<P>
   Mother Mary Hoops and Sister 3-Point are taking their act on the
road for the first time, along with their rulers, habits, wimples
(head covering) and puppet, ``Sister Box-Out.'' Then Sunday,
they'll be back at their familiar loca tion _ section 103, row 5,
seats 3-4 _ behind the opponents' bench at America West Arena,
giving Los Angeles Sparks center Lisa Leslie the kind of grief they
couldn't during April's U.S.-Argentina exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told her as long as she's playing for the USA, we'll be
nice,'' Mother Mary Hoops said. But that courtesy doesn't extend to
the WNBA season and particularly the Sparks, whom the Mercury
subdued in overtime of last year's reg ular-season finale to win
the Western Confer ence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nun of your business'' and ``Nun of the above'' are etched in
heavenly script on the women's wimples to answer the most asked
question: Are you really sisters?
</P>
<P>
   Yes they are, Mother Mary Hoops admits, but not to each other or
in a religious sense.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Newman, 56, the not so good mother, and Beth Ells, 49, the
somewhat wicked sister, both of Phoenix, both have biological
sisters. In fact, the genesis of their Mercury personas was the
Halloween that Newman and her real sister dressed up as nuns.
</P>
<P>
   Now they have become a symbol of one of the most raucous
audiences in town. The Mer cury led the WNBA in attendance (13,703
aver age) during its inaugural season and has doubled its season
ticket base to more than 9,000. These are not the corporate,
sit-on-the-hands types who can afford Suns tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Newman has seats for both, although her Suns tickets are in the
upper-bowl boonies, and she said the biggest difference is the ear
ringing that won't go away until hours af ter a Mercury game. Not
to men tion an almost symbiotic rapport with the players that
Newman said brought her to tears at the 1997 season opener.
</P>
<P>
   She and Ells played college basketball in the pre-Title IX days,
when resources and opportu nities for women were scarce.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started playing bas ketball in grade school, one could
only dribble the ball a total of three times, and only the rovers
could go as far as half court,'' Sis ter 3-Point says on the duo's
Web site (www.sistersofnomercy.com).
</P>
<P>
   ``As a freshman at Ohio State, I played varsity, which meant I
rode the pine quite a bit. All of this leads me to say that I'm
used to sitting on the sidelines cheering my teammates on . . . the
biggest difference is that now I get to carry a sign, a ruler and
cover my gray hair with a wimple.''
</P>
<P>
   To explain themselves, the sis ters quote Swiss psychologist
Carl Jung: ``The attainment of whole ness requires one to stake
one's whole being. Nothing less will do; there can be no easier
conditions, no substitutes, no compromises.''
</P>
<P>
   In simpler terms, no mercy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to do positive things,'' and not offend Catholicism,
Mother Mary Hoops said. ``Peo ple ask us to hold their babies or
have their picture taken with us. And you can't believe how many
people want to tell us their life story about going to Catholic
school, bloody knuckles, the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The sisters pulled together some novices to play in the Mer cury
3-on-3 tournament in Janu ary. The novices and postulants will
carry on the sisters' mission at four home games in July while they
are out of town, chaperoning students to Ireland, Wales and
England. Ells is an professor in the art department at Scottsdale
Community College.
</P>
<P>
   Their comings and goings are posted on their Web site. For ex
ample: June 11, Sacramento; June 18, Tempe Spaghetti Com pany (for
a Mercury appearance); July 16, Westminster Abbey, Lon don.
</P>
<P>
   The sisters drove here for the opener, a commitment even Mer
cury Coach Cheryl Miller couldn't believe when she was told. How
they'll be received at Arco Arena, where Sacramento averaged 7,858
last season, is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   At home, where the show is bigger and better, the sisters are
just part of the scene, but a prom inent part. When they were
invited on the court to dance with the Mercury Hip-Hop Spirit Squad
near the end of an exhibition game last week, ``our dream came
true,'' Mother Mary Hoops said.
</P>
<P>
   About all that could better is if owner Jerry Colangelo took the
advice of one of their early signs: Hire Nuns, Fire Galaxy (who has
been lost in space since the 1997 home opener) as team mascot.
</P>
<P>
   Mother Mary Hoops claims on the Web site to have prayed for the
WNBA since 1965. When that prayer was answered, ``I distinctly
heard God renew my call and to say that although I was too old to
play for the WNBA, I would never be old to play with the WNBA.'' &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The sisters pulled together some novices to play in the Mer cury
3-on-3 tournament in Janu ary. The novices and postulants will
carry on the sisters' mission at four home games in July while they
are out of town, chaperoning students to Ireland, Wales and
England. Ells is an professor in the art department at Scottsdale
Community College.
</P>
<P>
   Their comings and goings are posted on their Web site. For ex
ample: June 11, Sacramento; June 18, Tempe Spaghetti Com pany (for
a Mercury appearance); July 16, Westminster Abbey, Lon don.
</P>
<P>
   The sisters drove here for the opener, a commitment even Mer
cury Coach Cheryl Miller couldn't believe when she was told. How
they'll be received at Arco Arena, where Sacramento averaged 7,858
last season, is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   At home, where the show is bigger and better, the sisters are
just part of the scene, but a prom inent part. When they were
invited on the court to dance with the Mercury Hip-Hop Spirit Squad
near the end of an exhibition game last week, ``our dream came
true,'' Mother Mary Hoops said.
</P>
<P>
   About all that could better is if owner Jerry Colangelo took the
advice of one of their early signs: Hire Nuns, Fire Galaxy (who has
been lost in space since the 1997 home opener) as team mascot.
</P>
<P>
   Mother Mary Hoops claims on the Web site to have prayed for the
WNBA since 1965. When that prayer was answered, ``I distinctly
heard God renew my call and to say that although I was too old to
play for the WNBA, I would never be old to play with the WNBA.'' &QL;

 POPULATION LEVEL UNLIKELY TO SPIKE

<P>
   It's about 5:30 a.m. on Memorial Day. The driver heads north on
Arizona 87 toward Payson. He is beyond the Saguaro Lake turnoff and
enjoying the cool wind coming through the window.
</P>
<P>
   A sleek-looking coyote appears from the median and trots across
the highway, stopping nonchalantly to watch the vehicle pass. The
driver smiles. The cool, early morning is a wonderful time to see
all kinds of wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   The vehicle begins its climb out of the lower desert. The driver
has not yet donned sunglasses to face the morning sun. He is
admiring the lush vegetation around him when he spots movement to
the right. Another coyote?
</P>
<P>
   Not this time. A mountain lion emerges from the roadside
vegetation and lopes across the highway. The driver has seen
mountain lions in the wild but never one crossing a highway. He
starts to pull over, but that spooks the lion, which disappears
into the dense cover of the median.
</P>
<P>
   The driver picks up his camera but decides plunging into the
cover to ``play with kitty'' might not be a good idea. On a hike
near Strawberry several years ago, he was stalked by a young lion.
He remembers that, smiles again and drives away. This already is a
good day.
</P>
<P>
   It's spring turkey season. The hunter has a permit and is along
the East Fork of the Black River in the White Mountains. He'll fish
for trout first, then go call up a turkey.
</P>
<P>
   He uses a prepared trout bait (stinky stuff), then heads back to
his vehicle and stows his fishing gear. He picks up his turkey call
and single-shot shotgun then heads off. He is being followed.
</P>
<P>
   A black bear apparently has followed the scent of the trout
bait. It reaches the vehicle after the hunter has left, works over
the vehicle a little, then eats a plastic saguaro cactus atop on
the vehicle's radio antenna.
</P>
<P>
   Then it follows the hunter. The encounter is inevitable. The
hunter shoots the bear with the shotgun. Asked later by wildlife
officers if he could have fired into the air to possibly spook the
bear, the hunter says that he had no intention of trying to spook
it with a single-shot gun.
</P>
<P>
   The officers cut open the dead bear and find the plastic saguaro
in its stomach.
</P>
<P>
   The turkey hunter can't quit shaking after the encounter.
</P>
<P>
   These stories, both thrilling and chilling, aren't at all
unusual in Arizona. Such events occur probably a hundred times
every year. Arizona's two biggest predators, the black bear and the
mountain lion, are exceptionally fascinating creatures.
</P>
<P>
   The past few years were extremely dry and brought with them many
bear stories. Times were tough. These extremely adaptable creatures
found an easy meal when they could. If food and water were scarce,
some would come into town to find relief, knocking down a few doors
in search of food, eating garbage and even the occasional cat or
dog.
</P>
<P>
   This year has been different. El Nino's rains has meant
plentiful prey throughout the state. Rabbits, quail and other
wildlife that seemed to disappear are evident everywhere. Does that
mean the state will see a corresponding spike in the number of
predatory animals?
</P>
<P>
   No, says John Phelps, the fur-bearer biologist for the Arizona
Game and Fish Deartment.
</P>
<P>
   The big animals _ bears, lions, elk and deer _ don't respond in
the short term to spikes in the number of smaller game and
vegetation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not nearly as much reproduction from (bears and lions)
as with small animals,'' Phelps said. ``You can see improvement in
good years, but it's not nearly as significant as in smaller
animals.''
</P>
<P>
   Bears, Phelps said, are ``reproductively incapable.'' A female
typically is four years old before her first cubs are born. After
that, she typically will give birth every other year.
</P>
<P>
   Lions aren't quite the same, he said, but even in good years,
survival of the young isn't good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Population density is limited by interspecific strife,'' he
said. ``That means they kill each other. They're territorial
animals. It's a survival thing. If another animal of their kind
invades their territory, they might kill it.''
</P>
<P>
   Male bears are especially protective, he said. Cub survival rate
is no good because males often eat them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know exactly why,'' Phelps said. ``The cubs may be a
food source. Or it may be a sexual thing. They want to spread their
own genes and don't want anything to interfere with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Territory limits the number of large predators. Thus, it doesn't
matter how much food is available. The dominant creatures want no
intruders on their territory.
</P>
<P>
   Phelps said bears are more tolerant of each other. For instance,
if acorns or prickly pear fruit is abundant, a large number of
bears might share territory. They all have plenty and tolerate one
another.
</P>
<P>
   Lions are different.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not like bears,'' Phelps said. ``They are meat eaters
(bears are omnivorous). They seldom eat anything but something
they've killed. They don't allow an intruder.''
</P>
<P>
   Lions fear humans and will stay away, apparently deciding that
humans are too large for their prey base.
</P>
<P>
   Although bears are opportunists that will eat what they can,
most will stay away from civilization when their natural food is
plentiful, as it is this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most trouble we should have this year . . . are with bears
the are habituated to eating human garbage and things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Game and Fish officers will try to relocate those that do
venture into campsites and outlying areas, though Phelps said that
relocations seldom are successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``A fed bear usually is a dead bear,'' he said. ``Once they get
used to feeding off humans, there's usually no way to get rid of
them but kill them.''
</P>
<P>
   So you probably won't see much difference this summer in
predator problems. These creatures seem to limit themselves. But
with abundant food, they'll probably be really healthy.
</P>
<P>
   The populations won't increase or decline much. These creatures
keep their hunting grounds in order. &QL;

RICHARD YEZZO, 46, CREATOR OF AIDS CENTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (dc) 
 By BARBARA STEWART    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Richard Yezzo, an administrator who rescued a bankrupt St.
Clare's Hospital and Health Center in Manhattan by welcoming
patients that few others wanted _ people with AIDS in the early
years of the epidemic _ died on Friday at his home in New Rochelle.
He was 46.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, said his wife of 21 years, Phyllis
Yezzo.
</P>
<P>
   When Yezzo became president of St. Clare's in 1983, it was $16
million in debt and fear and ignorance about AIDS flourished. The
fast-growing group of patients with AIDS and AIDS-related illnesses
were scattered in various hospital units throughout the city, where
they sometimes encountered prejudice: orderlies who would leave
meal trays outside their door rather than enter their rooms, for
instance.
</P>
<P>
   At the behest of Cardinal John O'Connor, Yezzo set aside beds
and recruited medical staff for the AIDS wing, the first on the
East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then, there was a fear of designating an AIDS center,''
said Jeffrey Frerichs, president of Cabrini Medical Center in
downtown Manhattan. ``People thought it would stigmatize an
institution.''
</P>
<P>
   But Yezzo saw opportunities _ for helping sick people in need of
a wide range of medical treatments and social services and for
receiving Medicaid fees and government grants well above the usual
rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a smart move, an opportunistic move that benefited the
institution,'' Frerichs said.
</P>
<P>
   Under Yezzo's guidance, St. Clare's spread into many specialized
corners of AIDS care, providing the city's first outpatient AIDS
treatment center, its first methadone clinic for drug-addicted AIDS
patients and the state's first off-site unit for prisoners with
AIDS and other medical problems. Its dental clinic for AIDS
patients is still one of the city's best, said Dennis DeLeon,
president of the Latino Commission on AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was unpopular care at the time,'' said Dennis Whalen,
executive deputy commissioner of the New York State Department of
Health. St. Clare's, located in the Clinton neighborhood, was the
first medical center to join with the state's AIDS Institute to
create medical units devoted to a disease few wanted to face.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was willing to take risks,'' Whalen said, making the
hospital vital again by addressing a pressing community need. That
included homeless and drug-addicted residents of the Chelsea and
Clinton neighborhoods. More recently, it has included Latino
patients with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Some AIDS advocates had mixed feelings about St. Clare's Roman
Catholic affiliation. It was a place where O'Connor volunteered,
working with indigent AIDS patients. But it was also a hospital
that refused to distribute condoms as a part of safe-sex programs.
</P>
<P>
   Theater people, also, have had mixed attitudes toward the
hospital. Many have donated time to performances to raise money for
St. Clare's, known as Broadway's hospital. But when Yezzo tried to
expand by constructing badly needed new buildings on Eighth Avenue
between 49th and 50th Streets, industry leaders rallied to stop it.
A hospital would be out of place with show business, they said. In
the face of strong opposition, Yezzo dropped the project.
</P>
<P>
   When he was not at St. Clare's, Yezzo was often taking care of
others who asked for his help _ from the players on a Bronx
elementary-school basketball team to Mother Teresa, who sought his
help in opening a West Coast residence for people with AIDS. The
nuns of Mother Teresa's order, who run a Greenwich Village AIDS
residence, often called on Yezzo for help in fixing a boiler or
paying a bill, his wife said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took care of everybody,'' she said. ``He was like
everybody's Dad.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Clare's emerged from bankruptcy in 1990. But it is facing
another transition _ one that other hospitals devoted to inpatient
AIDS care are also grappling with. St. Clare's has cut back on its
AIDS-treatment units, as AIDS care has shifted from inpatient to
outpatient. It is trying to re-establish itself as a community
hospital for all kinds of ailments, said Mary Cataudella, a
hospital spokeswoman. Yezzo left the hospital last year to do
consulting, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Yezzo is survived by his wife, Phyllis, and two daughters:
Nichole, 18, and Marie, 15, as well as his mother, Anna, and a
sister, Angela. &QL;

`IT'S JUST HOCKEY,' HUNTER SAYS OF ROUGH STUFF
</HEADLINE>
  (dc) 
 By ED WILLES    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Dale Hunter has only been playing in the National
Hockey League for 18 years, so he did not see what all the fuss was
about. But his Washington Capitals teammates read a larger meaning
into his mugging of Steve Yzerman, the Detroit Red Wings' captain,
during Game 1 of the Stanley Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just hockey,'' said Hunter, a rugged center who is making
his first appearance in the finals.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Berube, Hunter's linemate, said: ``Dale had him down and
he showed him we're here to play. We're not happy just be here and
we're not happy just to be the Eastern Conference champs. We're
here to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter, the Capitals' 37-year-old captain, tangled with Yzerman
twice during the Red Wings' 2-1 victory Tuesday night. In the first
instance, Hunter rapped Yzerman. In the second, Hunter sat on
Yzerman behind the Capitals' net, then landed a series of noogies
to the back of his head before the Red Wings' leader took a
retaliatory minor for slashing. The two incidents were the only
moments of unruliness in an otherwise uneventful Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just holding him down,'' Hunter said. ``If I was banging
his head he would have been knocked out. We're aware of their good
players. We're just trying to play hard against them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Capitals, in fact, turned the tables and accused the Red
Wings of taking liberties with Peter Bondra and Joe Juneau,
Washington's finesse players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bondra got kneed, another one of our guys got speared,'' said
the Capitals' Chris Simon, the third member of the Hunter-Berube
line. ``If they want to play that way against our good players,
we'll play that way, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Berube said: ``If Darren McCarty runs Joe Juneau there's nothing
much I can do about it at the time. This is the Stanley Cup final.
You can't take a punch at the guy and take a penalty. But you can
play hard against their stars.''
</P>
<P>
   __
</P>
<P>
   LOW RATINGS? NOT TO WORRY
</P>
<P>
   The television ratings are down on both sides of the border for
the Stanley Cup finals. That is not surprising considering that the
NHL is suffering from a general lack of goals, excitement and
interest.
</P>
<P>
   But Commissioner Gary Bettman sees the league's well-documented
travails as a temporary aberration, not a deep-rooted set of
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reject the notion this is a game in trouble,'' he said. ``On
the contrary, I think the vital signs are good. We have strong
ownership and the franchises have never been more stable.''
</P>
<P>
   Bettman said the weak television ratings have been skewed by
poor numbers in New York, Los Angeles and other major centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they were the same there as last season, the overall
numbers would be about the same,'' he said.

CLIPPERS TAKE SNEAK PEEK AT BIBBY

<P>
   The Clippers had the privilege of working out Mike Bibby on
Tuesday. It's the only NBA team the talented University of Arizona
point guard has allowed to have a private glimpse of his skills.
</P>
<P>
   It may have been his only pre-draft performance, but Bibby
appeared anything but nervous while on display in a morning workout
at USC.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a lifelong dream to go through this situation,''
Bibby said. ``When I was in high school, I was just happy to get a
scholarship in college. I didn't really care about it when I made
my decision to turn pro, but this is unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers are expected to make Bibby the top pick in the
draft, which is June 24. Asked if he thought the Clippers would
select him, Bibby said, ``I hope.''
</P>
<P>
   With team executives Elgin Baylor and Andy Roeser inside USC's
Lyon Center, Bibby worked out for approximately an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a good feel for the game and is in excellent shape,''
Baylor said. ``I don't think he did anything that surprised me.
He's probably got more overall speed and quickness than he had in
college.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Bibby's father, USC coach Henry Bibby, showed up at
the Lyon Center to play racquetball just as Mike Bibby concluded
his workout. If the Clippers select him, Mike Bibby said his family
would move from Arizona to Los Angeles, including his baby son,
Michael Dane, and his mother, Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   There still remains the possibility the Clippers will trade the
No. 1 pick, but that prospect didn't faze Mike Bibby. ``It doesn't
matter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor said he expects to get more trade proposals as the draft
approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of things that could happen,'' Baylor said.
``Offers will increase. You just don't know what's going to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Baylor denied reports that Orlando has offered point guard
Anfernee Hardaway for the No. 1 pick. There are also rumors that
San Antonio might offer center David Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor said the Clippers will work out 19 players before the
draft, including Bibby. The Clippers also own the 22nd pick in the
draft.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other players the Clippers have looked at are
Minnesota guard Sam Jacobson, Kansas swingman Paul Pierce, Pacific
center Michael Olowokandi, Michigan forward Robert Traylor, UCLA
center Jelani McCoy, Ball State guard Bonzi Wells and Cincinnati
guard Ruben Patterson.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Clippers' coaching situation, Baylor would not say
when he will hire a replacement for Bill Fitch. Former Seattle
coach George Karl is the top choice, and has received permission to
talk to the Clippers. Karl is expected to wait until the NBA Finals
are completed, though, to see what other job offers may exist.
</P>
<P>
   Another prospective candidate, former Phoenix coach Paul
Westphal, now appears to be the front-runner to replace Karl in
Seattle. Westphal said last week he believed the Sonics would make
a decision before the draft.

KJ holds 
appeal for 
Rockets
<TEXT>
<P>
   Barkley endorses &QL; 
free-agent guard
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By EDDIE SEFKO &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
CHICAGO _ You've heard of a mother-and-child reunion. Feuding
families eventually reconcile. And there are a million stories of
long-lost friends getting back together after years of separation.
</P>
<P>
   So are you ready for Chuck and KJ, the sequel?
</P>
<P>
   Charles Barkley said Wednesday he has talked with former Phoenix
Suns teammate and free-agent point guard Kevin Johnson about the
possibility of joining the Rockets for next season.
</P>
<P>
   Sources at the NBA Finals confirmed Johnson is high on the
Rockets' list of free-agent possibilities. Teams cannot begin
contacting free agents until July 1, and the league's strained
labor-relations situation could delay that date further.
</P>
<P>
   But it's clear the Rockets are prepared to make a run at
Johnson. And, Barkley said, Johnson has indicated he would be
interested in joining the Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would automatically make us better,'' Barkley said.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley and Johnson were not the closest of friends when they
were teammates. But Barkley said the past two seasons apart have
drawn him closer to KJ.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm better friends with Kevin now than I was when I was
playing with him,'' Barkley said. ``I would love to have him here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked with Kevin a few times, and I think he'd be happy
to come here, because we'd have one more shot to win it all. I
think he showed last season he can still play.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 32, averaged 9.5 points and 4.9 assists for the
guard-heavy Suns in 1997-98. He split time with Jason Kidd and
Steve Nash. But in the second half of the season, when Johnson was
recovered from hamstring and knee problems, he was a productive
player for the Suns.
</P>
<P>
   Insiders at the NBA Finals said the Rockets' primary competition
for Johnson might be the Sacramento Kings. Johnson grew up in
Sacramento and maintains a close connection to the area, where he
is heavily involved in youth organizations.
</P>
<P>
   But going to Sacramento would yield Johnson virtually no chance
to win big. Even making the playoffs would be iffy.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets, who can't comment on their pursuit of any free
agents until after July 1 and whenever the collective-bargaining
agreement is settled, likely will have between $7 million and $10
million available under the salary cap this summer. They would like
to get two quality players with that money. Johnson, it is
believed, would be available for a relatively low sum by NBA
standards and could leave enough money for another good free agent.
</P>
<P>
   However, if the Rockets plan on pursuing Chicago's Scottie
Pippen, acquiring somebody of Johnson's caliber might not be
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and Barkley combined in 1993 to lead the Suns to the NBA
Finals, where they lost to the Chicago Bulls in six games. That was
Barkley's first season in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, Barkley and Johnson grew apart, partly because of
their diverse lifestyles. Barkley is a free spirit, to say the
least, while Johnson is regarded as a clean-living churchgoer.
</P>
<P>
   But their differences were only part of the problem. Barkley
said the Suns organization is partly to blame because executives in
the organization pitted Barkley against Johnson at times, which
resulted in a polarization of the two.
</P>
<P>
   Point guard is a position the Rockets have wanted to shore up,
although Matt Maloney did a good job in the playoffs against Utah's
John Stockton.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Western Conference is getting overrun with quality
point guards, with Stockton, Seattle's Gary Payton, Phoenix's Kidd,
Portland's Damon Stoudamire, Minnesota's Stephon Marbury and others
commanding respect at the position.
</P>
<P>
   The main needs for the Rockets heading into the offseason were
to get younger and more athletic and to find another ball-handler.
The trade of Kevin Willis on Tuesday was a step in addressing the
age issue.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson would give the Rockets a supreme ball-handler who also
can create his own offense. As for athleticism, a player like
Cedric Ceballos or Jim Jackson could be brought in, and with
Rodrick Rhodes' extra year of seasoning, that void might be filled.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, getting Pippen would mean getting an athletic
ball-handler _ at a price tag probably starting in the $8 million
to $10 million range and going up 20 percent each season
thereafter.

IRABU AND YANKS BEAT EXPOS, 6-2

<P>
   MONTREAL _ Hideki Irabu has been the Yankees' best pitcher and
perhaps the best in the American League this season. He stifled
Montreal Wednesday night, 6-2, striking out five in six innings as
his league-best earned run average rose to 1.59. With a 6-1 record,
he is a candidate to start the all-star game.
</P>
<P>
   But Irabu is probably the Yankees' worst athlete. Fielding bunts
is a challenge for him, and he sometimes doesn't bother to move to
first on ground balls to the right side of the infield. Earlier
this week, his manager anointed him as the team's worst hitter. In
addition to everything else, his helmet doesn't fit.
</P>
<P>
   With a line single in the second inning, Irabu became the first
Yankees' pitcher to get a hit since Larry Gowell hit a double on
Oct. 4, 1972, the season before the American League adopted the
designated hitter. Irabu also dropped a perfect bunt on an
impossible pitch in the fourth. There has never been greater
evidence that the Yankees are in the middle of a season to
remember.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have won nine straight, the longest streeak of the
season, and are 46-13 overall, which matches the best early-season
record in club history; the 1939 Yankees, who beat Cincinnati in
the World Series, also started 46-13.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Yankees lose the final game of the series with the
Expos, they have already won the series; they have won 23 straight
series, dating back to the first two days of the regular season.
The last team to win 24 straight series was the Cincinnati Reds in
1970.
</P>
<P>
   To say Irabu does not look the part of a hitter is like
suggesting Don Knotts doesn't appear presidential. His head seems
to bulge out of his ill-fitting helmet, and when he swings, his
first movement often is to move his back foot backward. Irabu
batted in an exhibition game in March and, after barely topping the
ball, simply returned to the dugout. There was no practical reason
to run to first.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, when Irabu batted in the second inning,
Montreal's Dustin Hermanson threw him a first-pitch fastball. Irabu
stepped backward with both feet, almost out of the box. Hermanson,
who typically throws in the mid-90s, then threw another fastball.
</P>
<P>
   This time Irabu stepped forward and ripped a line drive to
center field. Whoops could be heard coming from the Yankees' dugout
as Irabu ran stiffly to first base, a smile splitting his face. To
mark Irabu's first major-league hit, the umpires tossed the ball
out of the game..
</P>
<P>
   Two innings later, Irabu came to bat with runners at first and
second and one out, an obvious bunt situation. Before the second
pitch of the at-bat, with the Montreal infield anticipating the
bunt, Torre signaled for Irabu to try pulling back his bat and
slapping the ball _ which he nearly did, fouling off the pitch.
</P>
<P>
   With two strikes, Hermanson threw a neck-high fastball. Irabu
somehow reached up and bunted the ball past Hermanson. Shortstop
Mark Grudzielanek rushed in, fielded the ball and threw it wildly
to first, with one run scoring. Irabu was given credit for a
sacrifice bunt.
</P>
<P>
   Sanity was restored in the sixth inning. Hermanson threw a
breaking ball with two strikes and Irabu tumbled onto his back
although the pitch never came close to hitting him. Irabu flailed
weakly at the next pitch and struck out.
</P>
<P>
   He pitched pretty well, too, in the recent tradition of Yankees'
starting pitchers. During the nine-game winning streak, the
starters have compiled an ERA of 1.70, and averaged seven and
two-thirds innings per start.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu had a good fastball, as usual, against the Expos. But he
threw his curveball with more effect than in any of his other
starts this season, and after the first two innings, his
split-fingered fastball was diving. Irabu struck out the side in
the fourth inning; he has 54 in 68 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu was taken out of the game after a 36-minute rain delay in
the bottom of the seventh, the first delay since the roof was
removed from Olympic Stadium on May 19.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees scored early without Irabu's help. An error by
Montreal's Jose Vidro gave Tino Martinez a chance to bat with two
outs in the first inning, and Martinez blasted a two-run homer. Two
more runs scored in the fourth _ the Irabu inning _ and Scott
Brosius singled home Bernie Williams in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had a scare in that inning in a play they hope will
not have long-term ramifications. Williams slid awkwardly into
third as he stole the base in the sixth inning, his right knee
bending strangely. Williams grimaced and called for time, and
Yankees manager Joe Torre and Steve Donohue, the trainer, charged
onto the field to tend to him. Williams tested his knee and stayed
in the game another inning before leaving for a pinch-hitter in the
seventh. Williams' knee was to be examined late last night.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH
</P>
<P>
   Tim Raines stole the 800th base of his career in the eighth
inning, joining Rickey Henderson, Lou Brock and Ty Cobb in reaching
that plateau in this century. Raines, 38, played with Montreal from
1979 to 1990 before going to the American League. Before the first
game of this three-game series, Raines was honored here, given a
standing ovation, but he did not play. He was in the starting
lineup Wednesday night and was given a standing ovation again when
he was announced before his first at-bat. Raines walked to lead off
the eighth and, with Shayne Bennett pitching, Raines broke for
second. The throw from Chris Widger, the Montreal catcher, actually
beat Raines to the bag, but it eluded the shortstop. As his
teammates and the fans stood and cheered for Raines, he raised his
arms happily. Early in his career, Raines was the game's premier
base-stealer, swiping 70 or more bases in his first six full
seasons in the majors, including 90 in 1983, and 71 in 88 games in
the strike-shortened 1981 season. Raines' steal Wednesday night was
his fifth for this season, and the Yankees' 78th of 1998. The
Yankees stole a total of 99 last year ... Paul O'Neill beat out an
infield single in the fifth inning, extending his hitting streak to
17 games _ the longest of his career, and the Yankees' longest
since Derek Jeter hit in 17 straight games in 1996 ... Joe Torre,
the Yankees' manager, said he has no intention of using a six-man
rotation, despite the depth of his staff. Torre's feeling is that
regular extra rest might diminish the performances of David Wells,
Andy Pettitte and Ramiro Mendoza, three pitcher who badly need
regular work to remain sharp.
